 COLOMBIA
 Colombia is a multiparty democracy in which elected governments
 have ruled for all but 4 years (1953-57) of this century.
 While Colombia's two traditional political parties, the
 Liberals and the Conservatives, have dominated the political
 arena since the mid-19th century, smaller parties have fielded
 candidates at all levels and are usually represented in
 Congress, state assemblies, and city councils. Governors and
 mayors traditionally have been appointed by the President
 under a constitutional provision requiring "adequate and
 equitable" representation of the major party not holding the
 Presidency. However, Liberal President Virgilio Barco
 announced a "party government" after his electoral victory May
 25, 1986, offering greater participation to the losing
 Conservative Party. The Conservatives declined to accept any
 political or technical positions in the Barco Government and
 declared themselves to be in "reflexive opposition."
 Colombia has a mixed economy in which private enterprise plays
 an active role. The coffee industry, which accounts for one
 third of the country's export earnings, is in private hands,
 as are most entities engaged in manufacturing, agriculture,
 and provision of services. There is a relatively large
 informal economy. State enterprises control domestic
 participation in major export industries such as oil and coal
 and play a deciding role in the electrical and communication
 industries, but the Barco Government has stated its desire to
 reduce government participation in the economy.
 Notwithstanding its long tradition of electoral democracy,
 Colombia continues to experience high levels of both political
 and criminal violence. For most of the past 40 years, the
 country has lived under a constitutionally authorized state of
 siege to deal with civil disturbances, insurgent movements,
 and, most recently, organized crime. The state of siege,
 lifted in 1982, was reimposed in 1984, following the
 assassination of the Minister of Justice by narcotics
 traffickers, and remained in effect through 1987. Except for
 transferring terrorist cases from civilian to military courts
 (the Supreme Court has blocked transfer of narcotics cases to
 military tribunals), the current state of siege has left most
 civil liberties largely unaffected.
 The cease-fire accords negotiated under former President
 Betancur (1982-1986) have been broken by all the guerrilla
 movements, although the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia
 (FARC), the largest such group, still claims to adhere to the
 accords. (In 1985 the FARC established a political party, the
 Patriotic Union (UP) and participated in the 1986 congressional
 and presidential elections, fielding candidates at all levels).
 However, in mid-1987 the Government declared the truce broken
 in Caqueta and Huila Departments as a result of FARC ambushes
 of military convoys and attacks on small towns. President
 Barco's former Special Advisor for Rehabilitation,
 Normalization, and Reconciliation, Carlos Ossa Escobar, who
 was responsible for managing the peace process with guerrillas
 until he resigned in December 1987, met with FARC and UP
 leaders to continue negotiations. Categorically rejecting the
 Government's insistent call to disarm, the FARC demanded
 political and economic reforms; "purification" of the armed
 forces; lifting of the state of siege; and an end to "death
 squads." Ossa strongly criticized the FARC for truce-breaking
 but reiterated the Barco Administration's willingness to
 continue political discussions with the FARC and other
 guerrilla groups. Ossa's replacement will continue the

 discussions. jn October President Barco created a Permanent
 Advisory Council on Political Rehabilitation, Reconciliation,
 and  ordal.izAtion to improve dialog between the Government and
 gueti$il1a groups., At the end of1987, prospects for
 pifticipation in the peace process by the remaining guerrilla
 groups were doubtful.
 Humanrights in,Co-lombia during 1987 were seriously affected
 by the large number of apparently political assassinations.
 Such violence'has many sources and permeates Colombian society.
 This phenomenon is fed'by and contributes to the corrosion in
 judicial ad iinistratidn and the weak enforcement of law and
 order. 'During 19-87 "yarious gueixilla groups, drug traffickers,
 organized bandjof' hired .)Jlerd, paramilitary "death squads,"
 and ihdeperd6nt elements 'of the police 7and military acting
 outside the scdbe'of their official'duties escalated the
 alreadj 1hii Ieyel 1of violence, directly'challenging the
 Government !e ability to maintain order and preserve democratic
 institutions. Political leaders, human rights activists,
 labor'leaders, and members of the judicial branch have been
 especially"'argeted fpr assassination. While politicians from
 across the political spectrum have been victimized, leftist
 political leaders have been particularly singled out.

 holders7 were killed in 1987, including party leader and

 and an alternate senatbr. The Liberal and Conservative Parties
 have not been immune, stiffering the loss of 18 Conservative and
 32 Liberal'activists and.office holders during the year. On
 December 9, Commander of the FARC Tenth Front Rafael Reyes
 claimed responsibilify for the murder in November of a federal
 congressman from Bogota. The announcement was made during a
 television interview with the Government's Peace Advisor.

 COLOMBIA
 These murders are under investigation but few suspects have
 been arrested or charged in killings not attributed to one of
 the guerrilla groups. Motives for the killings are difficult
 to establish, but probably include personal, narcotics related,
 and other criminal reasons in addition to political motives.
 Accusations of military or paramilitary involvement in some of
 these killings continued. During 1987 the UP and a number of
 human rights activists openly charged the Colombian Armed
 Forces with human rights abuses. In 26 cases of political
 assassination or torture against persons associated with the
 UP, the UP publicly charged members of the armed forces with
 either carrying out the crimes or of directing civilians to
 commit them. Early in the year, charging that the Assistant
 Attorney General for the Armed Forces, an active duty Army
 General, would not be impartial, UP leader Jaime Pardo Leal
 refused to appear to file formal complaints and present
 evidence implicating security forces in the crimes. The
 Assistant Attorney General for the Armed Forces resigned in
 protest and a civilian, Omar Henry Velasco, was appointed to
 fill the job temporarily. No one has been named on a
 permanent basis.
 In September Mr. Velasco announced that 4 of the 14
 investigations initiated into the UP's charges produced
 sufficient evidence to begin criminal investigations against 8
 members of the armed forces. The officers under investigation
 include a lieutenant and a sergeant suspected of involvement
 in the September 1986 assassination of UP Senator Pedro Nel
 Jimenez." These officers have been suspended from their duties.
 Amnesty International and Americas Watch accused the Colombian
 armed forces of carrying out summary executions, torture, and
 disappearances "with the apparent authority of the army high
 command." The Attorney General is legally empowered to
 investigate and prosecute members of the security forces for
 human rights abuses. Charges of abuse by a member of the
 armed forces, the National Police, or the Department of
 Administrative Security are investigated and, if substantiated,
 the persons responsible are suspended from their duties and
 prosecuted. Few persons have been convicted, however.
 Amnesty International reported that: "the authority to punish
 human rights abuse was delegated exclusively to military
 courts.  ...those identified by civilian prosecutors as
 criminally liable in political cases generally remained in
 their posts, or, in some cases, were promoted. Whenever
 civilian investigators found evidence involving police or
 military personnel, cases were transferred to military courts,
 where military prosecutors generally declined to pursue them."
 The existence of "self-defense" groups, peasants armed to
 defend themselves and their lands from incursions by both
 guerrillas and criminal bandits, became a controversial topic
 during the year. The Constitution allows for self-defense.
 However, several government officials, political party members,
 and the Catholic Church expressed concern regarding the armed
 forces' ability to monitor these groups and prevent them from
 conducting offensive operations. In the only publicized
 incident involving a "self-defense" group, 11 members of a
 cattlemen's self-defense group were killed in an ambush while
 searching for cattle rustlers. An investigation resulted in
 the arrest of a nearby town's police chief who apparently led
 the townspeople to ambush the cattlemen's group believing that
 the group was going to attack the town.

 In this per~qd of active insurgency, statistics on killings
 and disappearances continue to be unreliable and subject to
 differing interpretations. The Permanent Committee for the
 Defense of Human Rights, the major human rights organization
 in Colombip, .reported 410 political killings during 1987. The
 Commiftee's data'are based on press reports,-,personal
 tes'timony,,.nd ncomplaints filed by relatives and friends of
 alleged yictims. Thp..Committee does not investigate incidents
 but conveys the information it gathers to the Attorney
 Generals office. Statistics issued by Colombian military
 intelligencq for.the period January 1 through September i0,
 1987, rejqited the deaths of 239 members of the  armed forces,
 464 guerrillas, and 556 civilians due to conflicts with the
 insurqeqts_
 The campaign 9f intirpidation and murder waged by the narcotics
 traffickers, continues.to threaten, Colombian human and
 politbial'r"Jghts.o DocWjments found.on four members of "Los
 Pripcos", a notoriousband ofki.llers hired by narcotics
 traffickers, marked a number of judges and others opposed to
 narcotics tra ticking'for a'sas'sination. The "Priscos" band
 has been 1.ilked to every, major narcotics-.related murder in the
 last 3 year, including the assassinations of Justice Minister
 RodrigIara Bonil1  (1984), Supreme Cgurt Justice Hernando
 Baquero porda (.1986), and El Espectador.Director Guillermo
 Cana (3086). Moreovpr,,there are reported conflicts between
 tra~fick~ri, and guerrillas over',paymenttor protection. In
 Nove0be'r a987., h:Ie G9yprnment announced that the October 11
 murder of Jaime Pardo Leal was masterminded by a high-level
 trafficker.  ... ;:   .           ,.: :   .
 b. Disappeapqc      .
 The'Attorney Genergl.s office .receives and investigates all
 reports of disappearances in Colombia. The lack of any
 systematic method of compiling and maintaining records reduces
 the usefulness of these statistics, however. For example, for
 1987.phe Attorney.,3eneral separately reported both 9 and 103
 compla4,n  .of disppearances. Ii-,oply-one case was the result
 of th.4nv4tig tion certain--the person's body was found a
 few wekslaftersh  twa  eprteA as missing. The Permanent
 Coniiittee jfor.the, Defense. of Human, Rights reported 67 -
 disapparancs between January and-September 1987. The
 military reported 3,41 kidnappings through September 10,, 1987,
 attributing 27 tQ the FARC, 28 to t~he National Liberation Army
 (ELN),   to the.April..19thMovement (M-19), 6;,tg the Popular
 Liberation Army (EPL).iand.76 to persons unknown. Of these, -42
 victims Vere eyentuallyfree, 5 escaped, 22 were killed, 19
 were resped,,4n0 5 3 are'stillbeing held.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 .,Trqatment or Punishment
 The AttorneyGeneral's office was unable to provide statistics
 for the number of allegations-of torture investigated during
 1987.. On" September.14, the.9oyernment announced.that Captain
 Rodrigo Mar tinez Vargas and Lieutenant Alvaro Retis were - "

 torturing two'men. toz death in,,Cartagena in 1983 and raping the
 sister of. one 9f the men, .Xheir cases have now-been forwarded
 to a oivilian cout for criminal investigation and prosecution.
 The Permanent CQmmittee for the Defense of- Human Rights
 received200. complaints alleging torture and stated-that.-
 
 
 COLOMBIA
 several soldiers and police have been suspended from duty
 pending investigations of their conduct. None has been
 convicted as yet.
 Colombian prisons are understaffed due to inadequate budgets.
 In most prisons, inmates receive a subsistence diet which they
 often supplement with purchases from prison stores. Family
 members and friends are allowed to visit regularly and to
 bring food and clothes. Consular officers are given regular
 access to foreign prisoners. Most prisoners accused of crimes
 in connection with guerrilla activities are incarcerated in
 regular prisons, although segregated from common criminals.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, Exile, or Forced Labor
 The constitutional right to a judicial determination of the
 legality of detention is generally respected. A person may be
 arrested if apprehended in the act of committing a crime or if
 an order of capture has been issued by the police on the basis
 of a denunciation by a private citizen, suspicion by the
 police, or a judge's order. The police must place the
 detained person at the disposition of a judge within 24
 hours. Where an unsworn statement is given by the suspect,
 the judge must hold a preliminary hearing, within 48 hours.
 During or after the preliminary hearing, if the judge finds
 that there is enough evidence to pursue the case, he issues an
 arrest warrant or an order of preventive arrest. Preventive
 arrest is an order to keep the person incarcerated until trial.
 Colombian law stipulates a specific time within which a trial
 must be held or the person released. Colombian law also
 provides for the granting of bail, parole, and probation.
 There are no legal provisions for exile. Forced or compulsory
 labor is legally prohibited, and the prohibition is respected.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The judiciary is independent of the executive and legislative
 branches of government. The rights of public trial and due
 process are provided for in the Constitution. Prisoners have
 the right to representation by counsel, and if a prisoner does
 not have an attorney, the court will appoint one. However,
 due to the overburdened and underfunded judicial system, the
 widespread practice of preventive detention, and the
 traditional reluctance to grant bail in serious cases, most
 prisoners incarcerated for common crimes never come to trial
 but are simply released after serving the minimum sentence
 applicable to the crimes alleged. In September 1987, there
 were approximately 29,000 persons in prison, of whom only
 8,000 had been tried and sentenced.
 The large and powerful narcotics subculture poses a serious
 threat to the Colombian judicial system. The enormous
 financial power wielded by traffickers has resulted in
 institutional corruption at all levels. Irregularities in the
 arrest of a narcotics trafficker in Cali in late 1987 resulted
 in 90-day suspensions of the District Attorney and his
 assistant, the Coordinator of Judicial Police. At the end of
 the year, the Attorney General opened an investigation into
 the conduct of two judges, the national Director of Prisons
 and his subordinates, employees of the Justice Ministry and of
 the Minister of Justice following the release of a major drug
 trafficker from prison. Magistrates, judges, and attorneys
 have been threatened or killed because they were investigating
 or prosecuting narcotics traffickers or their associates.

 State, which .leases time-to private companies'and imposes some
 guidelines to insure equal time for political candidates.,.
 During the 1986 congressional campaign, three leading
 candidates-appeared in a debate, and during the presidential
 campaign the Government insured that each-of four announced
 candidates received equal time for a series of national TV
 appearances. Beginning in 1987,'all,legally registered
 political parties have access by law :to national television.
 Each weeknight a.difftrent political party is allotted 10 ,
 minutes.otime. To maintain neutrality,- the parties' appearancas
 are rotated'alphabetically. Leaders of various -political
 groups are commonly interviewed on television.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Freedom of peaceful-assembly and association is generally
 respected. Public meetings and demonstrations are normally
 held without interference. Under the'state of siege, prior
 permission is-.required for demonstrations and is usually
 granted, except when the Government believes there is a clear
 and imminent danger to public order. During 1987, no marches
 or demonstrations by major groups or parties were banned in
 the capital, Bogota. Some demonstrations were restricted in
 outlying towns and regions afflicted with guerrilla violence.
 
 
 432
 COLOMBIA
 Colombian workers enjoy the right to organize and, in the
 private sector, to bargain collectively and to strike. Use of
 strikebreakers is prohibited by law, and generous severance
 benefits tend to discourage management from firing union
 militants. Many provisions of labor law, however, are
 effectively ignored by small and medium-sized enterprises.
 Given the high level of unemployment (currently about 12
 percent), unions have limited bargaining power and have been
 unsuccessful in organizing other than the largest firms and
 the public services. Only about 12 percent of Colombia's
 economically active population is unionized. Almost half of
 the country's 1.2 million unionized workers belong to a new
 labor front, the Unitary Workers Central (CUT), formed in
 1986. The remaining union members belong to three long-
 established confederations, two of which are affiliated with
 the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU).
 The third confederation is affiliated with the Christian
 Democratic World Confederation of Labor (WCL). Although the
 CUT is not officially a member of the Soviet-controlled World
 Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU), it is heavily influenced by
 its pro-Moscow Communist component and has retained strong
 links to the international Communist labor movement.
 Several trade union demonstrations and brief strikes occurred
 to protest the assassination of current and former labor
 leaders, including UP party leader Jaime Pardo Leal, killed in
 October. In August, a violent agrarian protest in the banana-
 growing region of Uraba left 30 to 40 workers dead. CUT union
 leaders claimed the workers were murdered by landowners during
 the 20-day strike. Ministry of Labor negotiators assisted in
 settling the dispute and ending the violence.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 The Constitution provides for freedom of religion. According
 to official statistics, 217 different religious sects are
 registered in Colombia. Although an overwhelming majority of
 Colombians are Roman Catholic, no legal discrimination exists
 against any religious group. In practice, however, some
 Evangelical Christians and other non-Catholic groups operating
 in Colombia have continued to encounter difficulties in
 obtaining entry and resident visas for additional or
 replacement mission workers.
 d.    Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Colombians are free to leave and return to the country. In
 areas under government control where operations against rural
 guerrilla groups are under way, traveling civilians require
 "safe conduct" passes; guerrillas reportedly use a similar
 means to restrict travel in areas under their control.
 Colombians who have sought and been granted diplomatic asylum
 in foreign embassies have always been allowed to depart the
 country. Expatriates can, by law, repatriate. Colombia in
 the past has accepted refugees; however, because of high
 unemployment and underemployment, the Government is
 increasingly reluctant to accept displaced persons. The
 Government does not forcibly repatriate asylum seekers.

 Section 3 :Respect for Political Rights-: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Colombia has a democratic system 6f government, and elections'
 are conducted.fairly and openly. However, many Colombian
 political observers agree that traditional pplitical patronage
 continues to affect election outcomes in some areas. In other
 areas, the financial influence of narcotics traffickers poses
 a threat.to the integrity of the electoral'process. Persons
 are enfranchised by the Constitution at age 18. Those
 convicted of certain crimes may be disenfranchised. Public
 employees are forbidden by law to participate in political
 campaigns but, with the exception of military personnel, can
 vote.
 Colombiaf,'pplitics are dominated 'by' two major parties, the
 Liberal ad the Cohservative, and each includes elements with
 widely divergent political views. However, all parties are
 free to raise-funds, -field candidates, hold public meetings,
 have access -tothe  media, and publish their own newspapers.
 The UP, ,participating in national. elections for the first time
 in 1986,': Qh 3 seats, in. the Senate and 5 in the House of
 Represetait.ves"  n the cQngessional elections and 4..5 percent
 of the vote in the pr~sidentia6lepetion, the best showing by
 a third partyjin recent history.                        .
 Legislatiqr)roviding for direct electiono. f mayors,beginning
 in March 1988 was signed into law by President Betancu*r
 January 1t,,986., The Colombian Congress is still considering
 legislatfon to expand "popular consultation"--popufar  "
 referendums and recall of elected officials. In October 1986,
 the Government proposfd.a constitut.onpi reform that would
 provide up to six new congressiona, seats specificilly for
 small part is' on a. national, rather than departmental, basis.
 The drft reform wbu d also increase 'ihe number of.
 congressional seats jor  the sparsely settled eastern plains
 and would pp.rmit public financing of election expenses'. The
 Congress has ,yet to vote on this reform.
 Section 4 Governmental..Attitude Regarding lnternational and
 Nongoyernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Colombia, has welcomed nongovernmental human rights
 organizations. The Colombian Human Rights Commission
 established by.  the Attorney General in 1985 continues to
 operate although it rarely meets as a whole. The Assistant
 Attorney General for Human Rights, a member of the Cbmmissioni
 is involved in investigations of alleged violations. However,
 interqat oal human rights inquiries are now submitted to the
 International Organizations Sub-secretariat of the Foreign
 Ministry, which has made responding to allegations of
 violations a priority. Also, human rights investigations are
 now conducted by the National Police and Department of
 Security instead of the ill-equipped and understaffed Attorney
 General's Office.
 The Permanent Committee for the Defense of Human Rights is the
 most active nongovernmental Colombian human rights
 organization. Its 94 members include members of Congress--a
 UP Senator is the Executive Secretary--journalists, labor
 leaders, and persons in the arts, including Nobel Laureate
 Gabriel Garcia Marquez. The Committee compiles statistics
 based on press reports and.personal testimony, which it turns
 over to the Government for investigation and possible
 
 
 434
 COLOMBIA
 prosecution. It has no staff or budget to conduct its own
 inquiries. The Committee's statistics have been used
 extensively by international organizations such as Amnesty
 International, Americas Watch, and the Washington Office on
 Latin America. The Committee also sponsors periodic human
 rights forums in Colombia.
 Columbia is an active participant in international and
 regional human rights bodies.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 The law assures women equal civil and property rights. Their
 economic situation is inferior, however, especially in rural
 areas. Women comprise just over 25 percent of the country's
 economically active population but are concentrated in low-
 productivity, low-income sectors. The historically higher
 unemployment rate for women has decreased in recent years.
 Women are legally entitled to pay equal to that of their male
 counterparts and normally receive equal salaries when employed
 by the Government. Such is not generally the case, however,
 in private industry. As more women graduate from universities
 and participate in the work force, they are increasingly
 active at all levels of society. A growing number of women
 are receiving higher education; women currently comprise 40
 percent of the university population. Women also serve as
 legislators, judges, governors of departments (states),
 political party leaders, government officials, and diplomats.
 Colombian Indians legally enjoy all rights and privileges of
 full citizenship. However, Indian rights groups protest that
 they suffer a variety of abuses and they are seeking to
 promote local improvements through community action, public
 education, and legal aid. Their most common complaint is that
 they are forced off contested land by paramilitary thugs hired
 by landowners. When the Indians retaliate, the landowners
 call on local police and military forces for protection. In
 at least one recent case, a major land dispute involved
 contending Indian families in one tribe. One Indian group has
 organized a guerrilla band, the "Quintin Lame," reportedly
 allied with other guerrilla groups against the Government.
 The upsurge of land occupation by Indian groups that began in
 mid-1984 continued unabated in 1987. Some landowners attribute
 this to leftist political activists; other observers consider
 it a natural result of the historical struggle between
 indigenous groups and landowners for control of rural areas,
 perhaps exacerbated by current politicking over land reform.
 Whatever the cause, the trend of increased land invasions
 continues to create concern in Government and among landowners.
 CONDITIONS OF LABOR
 The law prohibits the employment of children in most jobs
 before the age of 14, particularly where such employment might
 interfere with schooling. These provisions are respected in
 the larger enterprises and major cities. However, the
 extensive "informal" economy--an unofficial sector where
 workers are employed by relatives or self-employed--is
 effectively outside government control. Approximately 2.5
 million children under 15 work in the informal sector for low
 pay under poor conditions with little protection from the
 labor code. The labor code regulates the hours of labor and
 other work conditions. The 8-hour day is standard in larger
 companies, but the workweek generally exceeds 40 hours; a
 
 
 4315
 COLOMBIA
 standard week of five 8-hour days remains an important
 long-term goal of Colombian trade unions.
 The Governmii? tannua lly sets -a national minimum wage which
 serves as a Important 'benchmark for iage bargaining. The
 minimum Wag   s'ehailft sufficilent to -maintain an acceptable
 standard of  liVrjn, 'bt erosion from inflation (running close
 to 24 prcdnt ftyear's end) is a continuing problem. Workers*
 occupationilsafety and health are extensively regulated,
 including use of protective clothing and ventilatidn; first
 aid and fire fighting dquipment-at the job site, sanitary
