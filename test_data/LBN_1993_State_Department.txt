 LEBANON
 Constitutionally, Lebanon is a parliamentary democratic republic. By tradition,
 the President is a Maronite, the Prime Minister a Sunni Muslim, and the Speaker
 of the Chamber of Deputies a Shi'a Muslim. The 128 deputies are divided equally
 between Christians and Muslims.
 Non-Lebanese forces continue to control much of Lebanon. Their presence im-
 pinges on Lebanese central authority and prevents the application of normal con-
 stitutional protections in those areas. There are 30,000 Syrian troops in Lebanon.
 A 1991 security and defense pact establishes a cooperative framework between Leb-
 anese and Syrian armed forces, but Syrian military and intelligence units operate
 independently. According to the Taif accord, the two governments were to decide in
 September 1992 to redeploy Syrian troops to the Biqa' Valley, with full redeploy-
 ment shortly after. Lebanese officials failed to raise the issue with the Syrian Gov-
 ernment. They have at times cited a number of reasons, including the army's al-
 
 
 1236
 
 leged unreadiness to take over routine security functions performed by Syrian
 troops. Pervasive   Syrian  influence  over  Lebanese   politics  and  Lebanese
 decisionmakers lay at the root of this unwillingness to engage Damascus. The U.S.
 Government has publicly called for a decision to redeploy.
 Israel exerts control in and near its self-proclaimed "security zone" in southern
 Lebanon largely through the Army of South Lebanon (SLA) and the presence of
 about 1,000 Israeli troops. The SLA maintains a separate and arbitrary system of
 justice in the zone, without reference to central Lebanese authority. Palestinian
 groups operate autonomously in refugee camps located throughout the country and
 maintain a separate, arbitrary system of justice for fellow Palestinians.
 The Government continued to consolidate its authority in some parts of the coun-
 try by disarming Christian militias and the pro-Fatah Popular Nasirite organization
 but was less concerned with disarming others, especially in the south. It made no
 effort to disarm the Iranian-backed Hizballah and its allies or the Israeli-backed
 SLA. A decades-old cycle of raids and counterraids in the south continued between
 Hizballah and allied guerrillas on one hand and the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF)
 and SLA on the other. Following Hizballah Katyusha rocket attacks against civilian
 targets in northern Israel in July, the IDF launched an intense, week-long series
 of attacks, termed 'Operation Accountability." Over 150 persons were killed and 500
 wounded in Lebanon, and thousands of houses were destroyed or damaged. A chief
 feature of the operation was a declared policy of depopulating the south. Israeli
 warnings to civilians to flee led to the dislocation of over 300,000 people for a 1-
 week period. There were credible accounts of IDF use of phosphorous shells against
 military and civilian targets.
 Lebanon has a free market economy. The country possesses few important natural
 resources. Before the outbreak of civil war in 1975, Lebanon was an important fi-
 nancial and commercial center, but the war greatly weakened its commercial leader-
 ship and inflicted massive damage on its economic infrastructure. In 1993 the econ-
 omy partially recovered from sharp deterioration in the previous 2 years. The Hariri
 Government was able to restore public confidence, stabilize the economy, and launch
 a program to reconstruct the economy's infrastructure.
 The human rights situation in Lebanon deteriorated as the Government launched
 two sets of assaults in 1993. The Government frequently arrested without due proc-
 ess opponents of government and Syrian policy in Lebanon, temporarily closed three
 newspapers, and indefinitely suspended broadcasting by a television network critical
 of the Government. The level of violence was at its lowest since civil strife began
 in 1975, but civilians and their property continued to be victims of artillery and aer-
 ial attacks, bombings, abductions, assassinations, and explosions. The Government
 made a small start in returning to their homes some of the more than 600,000 Leba-
 nese displaced by the civil war.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-Political killings continued to occur
 in 1993, but the number declined as the Government further consolidated its au-
 thority over portions of the country. On December 20, unknown persons bombed the
 east Beirut headquarters of the Kataib Party while a meeting of the party's Polit-
 buro was under way; two persons died and 130 were injured, many of them party
 officials. Numerous dynamite attacks by unknown persons on cars and buildings
 throughout Lebanon caused some casualties and serious property damage. In June
 members of the militant Sunni Islamic Grouping tried to blow up a busload of cler-
 ics attending a Catholic-Orthodox ecumenical conference in north Lebanon, but their
 explosive device went off prematurely killing one of the perpetrators. The authcri-
 ties arrested six suspects and charged them with inciting sectaria-n discord and at-
 tempting to assassinate clerics, but they have not yet been tried. An official of the
 Druze Progressive Socialist Party (PSP) and a member of the militant Islamic Al-
 Ahbash movement, amonothers, were assassinated. In April Israeli helicopters at-
 tacked the car of Samir Suwayden, Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine
 (PFLP) commander in South Lebanon, near Yatar. His wife, daughter, and another
 person were killed.
 Rival Palestinian factions continued to engage in a cycle of politically motivated
 murder, mostly in the southern city of Sidon and nearby refugee camps but also in
 Beirut. At least 11 such killings occurred during the spring. Most of the targets
 were officials of Fatah and the Abu Nidal organization ( atah - Revolutionary Com-
 mand). Other Palestinians were the object of assassination attempts, including Mu-
 hammad Abu Samra of the Palestinian Islamic Jihad movement.
 
 
 1237
 b. Disappearance.-There were no known disappearances in 1993 attributable to
 state security forces. However, thousands of Lebanon's inhabitants kidnaped during
 the years of civil unrest remained unaccounted for. Militias and non-Lebanese forces
 were responsible for most of these kidnapings. Some victims are believed to have
 been summarily executed. The Government has taken no *udicial action against
 groups responsible for the kidnapings, including those which held Western hostages.
 The families of the missing formeda group to pursue their cause with the help of
 a Beirut lawyer and former member of one of the militias, the Sunni Muslim
 Murabitun.
 C. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 There were credible reports of the use of excessive force by the Lebanese army
 against detained members of the former militia of the Lebanese Forces (LF). Abuse
 included beatings as well as tying detainees' hands behind their backs and suspend-
 ing them from the wrists for lengthy periods. Those responsible for the abuse were
 not punished.
 Conditions in some prisons are harsh, threatening the lives and health of the in-
 mates. A former police commander, Brigadier Antoine Saadah, alleged in a study
 published locally that overcrowdin in Lebanese prisons in some instances exceeded
 our times the normal occupancy. The Beirut-area Roumieh prison, designed to ac-
 commodate 246 prisoners, is said actually to house more than 1,000. Saadah and
 other human rights activists report instances of suffocation resulting from the over-
 crowded conditions. An eyewitness said overcrowding in Batrun prison was particu-
 larly bad, with 40 people jailed in a 15-foot cell.
 Abuses also occurred in areas outside the State's authority. There were persistent
 and credible reports that various Palestinian groups engaged in torture of Palestin-
 ian rivals. In June, when Fatah released 95 members of the Abu Nidal group from
 its prison in southern Lebanon, for example, the prisoners alleged torture and ill
 treatment.
 Supporters of exiled General Michel 'Awn credibly reported that they had suffered
 torture by Syrian security elements during prief periods of detention in the autumn
 and winter of 1993. There were also allegations of torture and abuse by the SLA
 at AI-Khiyam prison in the Israeli-ontrolled security zone. One international ob-
 server has concluded that torture and other cruel treatment is no longer widespread
 at the AI-Khiyam prison, based on evidence gathered in interviews with released
 risoners. The SLA continued to deny access to the facility by the International
 Commiittee of the Red Cross (ICRC).
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Arrest warrants are required before ar-
 resting a suspect. There were credible reports however, of the availability of blank
 warrants signed by the military prosecutor. by law, arresting officers must refer
 suspects to a prosecutor within 24 hours of arrest. A suspect must be released if
 not charged within 48 hours of arrest. However, some government prosecutors au-
 thorized the indefinite detention of suspects for interrogation without reference to
 a court or a judge. The law permits incommunicado detention at the discretion of
 the investigating judge. Every person arrested has the right to legal counsel, but
 there is no public defender's office. The bar association has an office to serve those
 who cannot afford a lawyer. Bail is permitted in most cases, excluding felonies.
 The army ignored due process in a campaign of arbitrary arrests in 1993. Its ef-
 forts focused on members of the former militia of the Christian Lebanese forces,
 sympathizers of the exiled former army commander and self-proclaimed Prime Min-
 ister Michel 'Awn, and members of Lebanon's Popular Nasirite Organization (PNO),
 a former militia noted for close links to Fatah. All these groups were at odds politi-
 cally with the Syrian and Lebanese regimes and Syrian policies in Lebanon. In the
 autumn and winter of 1993, the Lebanese army arbitrarily arrested dozens of 'Awn's
 supporters and turned them over to Syrian Military Intelligence (SMI) units in Leb-
 anon. SMI typically held them briefly in detention, and the detainees provided credi-
 ble reports of torture during interrogation. These arrests occurred in the wake of
 attacks with small explosives on Syrian sentries in Christian areas near Beirut.
 Lebanese authorities arrested a member of an extremist Christian group, the
 Guardians of the Cedars, in November on the charge of conspiring with 'Awn and
 the Israeli Government. Military court proceedings were under way at the end of
 the year.
 In the summer, the army arrested 30 members of the LF and held them incommu-
 nicado for more than a week without placing charges or referring the cases to the
 military prosecutor. Later, these members of the LF were accused of threatening
 state security and of assassinating Lebanese army officers and soldiers in 1990. The
 LF and an army faction backing Michel 'Awn's seizure of power were fighting at the
 time. One LF member remains in detention. The army also took steps to purge its
 ranks of suspected LF members.
 
 
 1238
 Authorities arrested four PNO members July 20 and released them in September.
 They were never charged.
 Amnesty International reported in April that 8 persons were arrested in March
 for distributing leaflets opposing the Government and the presence of Syrian troops
 in Lebanon. They were believed to be held incommunicado for an unknown period
 at the Defense Ministry. 'Awn supporters alleged that brief detentions by the army,
 for periods ranging from a day to a week, were commonplace. In July a leading
 *Awnist was arrested for defamation after he issued a press release making exagger-
 ated claims that hundreds of illegal detainees were in Lebanese jails. He was de-
 tained for 7 days.
 Arbitrary detention by local militias and non-Lebanese forces continued to occur
 in areas outside the central Government's authority. In March the Israeli navy de-
 tained for 24 hours five Lebanese fishermen who were fishing off the coast of Tyre
 inside Lebanese territorial waters. In March Israeli forces released three citizens it
 had arrested inside the security zone and held without charges for about 20 days.
 The SLA continued to hold at least 350 Lebanese and Palestinian detainees at Al-
 Khiyam prison and denied access to them by the ICRC and family members. Seven-
 teen detainees were released in March and another three in May. In March the Ira-
 nian-backed Hizballah militia handed over to the ICRC one person and the remains
 of another. The party had kidnaped them 2 years ago. No judicial action was taken
 against Hizballah.
 The Government does not normally use exile as a means of punishment. However,
 in 1991 it pardoned former army commander and self-proclaimed Prime Minister
 'Awn, along with two aides, on condition that they leave the country and remain
 in exile for 5 years. They were accused of usurping power.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-Each confessional group has its own court for fam-
 ily and personal status cases. There is a separate military court system. In refugee
 camps Palestinian elements operate an autonomous and arbitrary system of justice;
 rival Palestinian factions often try their opponents without due process.
 Although Lebanese law provides the right to a fair public trial and the judiciary
 is considered independent and relatively impartial, influential politicians continued
 to intervene successfully to protect supporters from detention and prosecution. Gov-
 ernment interference in the judicial process and low judicial salaries led to the res-
 ignation of several prominent judges and to corruption and bribery of others. The
 Government took steps to adjust salaries in September. The appointment of judges,
 like other government appointments, is allocated on the basis of religious affiliation.
 The resignations, agravating an already severe shortage of judges dealt a blow
 to efforts to speed adjudication and erase a backlog of cases that had developed dur-
 ing the civil war. An inability to conduct investigations in areas outside effective
 government control also caused trial delays.
 The legal system is discriminatory in its handling of so-called crimes of honor.
 Men, for example, are typically acquitted of murder charges in cases involving the
 murder of adulterous wives. By law, in some instances a female's testimony before
 a notary public carries half the weight of that of a male.
 There are no known political prisoners although political opponents of the Syrian
 and Lebanese regimes are often detained without charges for short periods of time.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-While
 Lebanese authorities generally show no interest in controlling personal life, they are
 not reluctant to interfere with the privacy of some foes. Laws require that govern-
 ment prosecutors obtain a warrant before entering houses, except when the Leba-
 nese army pursues an armed attacker. Militiasand non-Lebanese forces operating
 outside areas of central government authority frequently violated rights of privacy.
 Various factions and the Government use informer networks and monitor tele-
 h hones to gather intelligence on their foes. A Member of Parliament, former Prime
 inister Salim Al-Huss, questioned the Government about taps on phones belonging
 to members of Parliament and politicians but received no response.
 g. Use of Excessive Force and Violations of Humanitarian Law in Internal Con-
 flicts.-The situation in South Lebanon remained explosive. Hizballah and other
 Lebanese and Palestinian militias on the one hand, and Israel and the SLA on the
 other, engaged in a cycle of violence which led to civilian casualties in South Leb-
 anon and the deaths of two members of the United Nations Interim Force in Leb-
 anon (UNIFIL). Lebanese and Palestinian militias attacked SEA and IDF troops de-
 ployed on Lebanese soil and Israeli civilians in northern Israel. The Israelis directed
 ir strikes and artillery shelling on alleged guerrilla and terrorist targets inside
 Lebanon.
 Events culminated in July when Israel launched land, sea, and air attacks on
 Lebanon in "Operation Accountability." The Israeli offensive was designed to put an
 end to militia rocket attacks on northern Israel. The intense, week-long assault in-
 
 
 1239
 cluded a declared policy of depopulating the south, accomplished by using radio
 broadcasts and leaflets to warn residents of named villages, towns, and cities to flee
 by certain deadlines. These tactics resulted in mass panic and the dislocation of over
 300,000 southerners, who sought refuge in areas to the north, including Beirut. Dur-
 ing the Israeli strikes, about 150 civilians were killed and 500 wounded. Nine hun-
 dred houses were completely destroyed and 2,450 were partially damaged.
 There were credible eyewitness reports of Israeli use of phosphorous shells with
 respect to both Lebanese military and civilian targets. International observers found
 evidence that at least 17 civilians had received phosphorous burns.
 On September 13 the Lebanese army openedfire on demonstrators in the south-
 ern suburbs of Beirut. Nine civilians were killed and 36 wounded. Hizballah had
 organized the rally to protest the signing of the Israeli-Palestinian agreement in
 Washington, despite direct warnings from the Government and Syrian authorities
 that they intended to enforce a ban on demonstrations. The army said soldiers acted
 in self-defense after elements in the crowd had opened fire. The Government says
 it is investigating the incident.
 Violations of international humanitarian standards with respect to treatment of
 prisoners continued to occur.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-Lebanon has a long heritage of freedom of opin-
 ion, speech, and press, although many Lebanese journalists have been killed and
 kidnaped in the past two decades by Lebanese and foreign factions. Although there
 were repeated attempts to muzzle these freedoms in 1993, criticism of the Govern-
 ment's poiies and leaders continued. Dozens of newspapers and magazines are
 published throughout Lebanon, financed by various Lebanese and foreign groups.
 While the press is nominally independent, press content often reflects the opinions
 of these f'mancial backers. In addition, a legal framework exists to impose restric-
 tions on the media. Some restrictive press regulations were imposed during the civil
 war but remain in place, such as Decree 104 of 1977. Laws prohibit attacks on the
 dignity of the head of state or of foreign leaders, authorize the prosecutor general
 to shut newspapers for up to 1 week without reference to the courts if articles ap-
 pear that, in the view of the authorities, threaten Lebanon's foreign relations or in-
 cite sectarian conflict, and prohibit the publication of state secrets. A special publi-
 cation court exists to try cases involving these matters. The 1991 Lebanese-Syrian
 security agreement contains a provision effectively banning informational activity
 that could endanger the security of either State.
 In April and Ma the Government temporarily shut down three newspapers. Nida'
 AI-Watan, owned by a vocal Maronite critic of Prime Minister Hariri, was accused
 of inciting sectarian discord and suspended for 38 days. It had alleged that Hariri
 was buying Christian church property in a bid to Isl amize Lebanon. AI-Safir, one
 of Lebanon's most popular dailies, was closed for publishing alleged state secrets.
 It had printed the text of an Israeli proposal submitted to the Lebanese delegation
 to the Middle East peace talks. During the paper's 1-week suspension, it appeared
 using a valid permit for the moribund Beirut Al-Masa' newspaper. Trials in both
 cases are under way. A-Sharq was closed for 1 week after printing a cartoon that
 was deemed insulting to the President's family. In October the Public Prosecutor
 charged two newspapers Al-Liwa and Ad-Diyar, with slandering government offi-
 cials. The Government also made a new charge against Nida' Al-bWatan in October
 for publishing a story alleging that Japanese Red Army members were present in
 Lebanon. The authorities denied the story and said it harmed Lebanon's reputation.
 A p r-Awn publication was closed in October for distributing pornography.
 Direct press criticism of Syria and its role in Lebanon virtually vanished in 1993.
 One leading journalist was subjected to anonymous threats after writing columns
 critical of aspects of Syrian policy in Lebanon. Other reporters described a wide-
 spread practice of self-censorship on matters related to Syria.
 Diverse political groups, particularly former militias, operated a wide variety of
 unregulated radio and television stations. As these groups accepted the spread of
 state authority and began to manage their broadcasts on a commercial basis, heav-
 ily slanted propaganda diminished. The Taif accord calls for the regulation and or-
 ganization of the broadcast media; this proposal is controversial, however, and the
 Government has not submitted a draft law to Parliament. Pending passage of new
 regulations, the Information Minister and major stations signed an honor code in
 February banning programming which would disturb public order, stir ethnic or sec-
 tarian enmity, slander Lebanese leaders or friendly nations, violate moral stand-
 ards, or promote Israel. The honor code has no discernible impact on broadcasting.
 Exploiting the absence of a legal framework, the Government moved to close one
 of its critics, the Independent Communications Network (ICN). The station, owned
 
 
 1240
 
 by the publisher of Nida' Al-Watan, was accused of inciting sectarian discord. In late
 December, the Civil Court permitted ICN to resume broadcasting and scheduled for
 February a hearing of the Government's case against the broadcaster. The Public
 Prosecutor has asked for prison sentences of 3 years for ICN management.
 Lebanon's partially state-owned television station, Tele-Liban, had long enjoyed
 virtual autonomy with respect to its news and public affairs programming. The Cab-
 inet, however, reasserted in August the Information Minister's legal right to monitor
 and effectively control Tele-Liban's activities.
 In 1993 the Government revived police control over all nonperiodical publications,
 books, foreign magazines, plays, and films, which must be submitted to the Public
 Security Directorate for approval before distribution. A prize-winning film on na-
 tional reconciliation was banned for several months and released only after the pro-
 ducer made some changes. The police briefly closed a play, "The Rabbit and the
 Saints," acting on a request from the Maronite church. Censors later reversed the
 decision. Police confiscated a novel, "Garden of the Senses," by a well-known local
 author, saying it had pornographic passages.
 Lebanon has a strong tradition of academic freedom and a flourishing private edu-
 cational system, born from the inadequacy of public schools and an attachment to
 sectarian affiliations. Students exercise the right to form campus associations, and
 the Government does not usually interfere with student groups. The Government's
 arrests of students sympathetic to the exiled General Michel 'Awn and to the Leba-
 nese Forces in 1992 chilled student activism among those students in 1993.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Associatwn.-Any group wishing to organize
 a rally must obtain the prior approval of the Interior Ministry, but this law is not
 uniformly applied. Some political factions, such as the Shi'a Amal movement, the
 Christian Kataib Party, and the mostly Druze PSP were permitted to stage rallies
 during 1993 but some Christian groups were not. The army obstructed a meeting
 of the Katail Party Salvation Committee (a group at odds with the policies of the
 party mainstream), and the Interior Ministry did not grant the Committee a permit
 or a rally. Other Christian groups opposed to the Government were warned by
 army intelligence officers against staging rallies.
 Hizballah held demonstrations and marches unhindered by the authorities. On
 September 13, however, the army opened fire on Hizballah demonstrators in an ef-
 fort to impose a government ban on protests (see Section 1.g.). The rally was staged
 in opposition to tne Israeli-Palestinian agment. Sunni Is amist groups in Tripoli,
 foiled by the government ban from main    a similar protest, later organized an
 antipeace process gathering inside a mosque.
 Army intelligence monitrs the movement and activities of members of opposition
 groups, some of whom charged that intelligence officers have warned them against
 holding private meetings wit other oppositonists.
 Neither Israel nor Syria allows groups openly hostile to them to operate in areas
 they control.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-Lebanese practice their various religions freely. There
 are 17 officially recognized sects, including numerous Christian denominations,
 Muslims (Sunni, Shia, and others), and Drze. There is no state religion, but Leb-
 anon's confessional political system means that a wide range of government posi-
 tions are rilled on the basis of religion.
 There are no restrictions on any particular religious groups, foreign clergy, or
 places of worship. Religious  fups are free to pub ish religious material, operate
 schools, and establish charitable organizations.
 Lebanese have the legal right to convert frm one religion to another, but the con-
 fessional character of society makes conversion to another religion difficult. Women,
 however, often adopt the religion of their husbands. Conversion can mean ostracism
 from family and friends. Local religious leaders often pressure members of their con-
 gregations against taking part in the religious activities of other grups.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-mLebanes traditionally have enjoyed freedom of travel, domestic and
 foreign. The spred of government authority has removed barriers that blocked do-
 mestic travel during the civil war, but obstacles remain. Lebanese armed forces and
 Syrian troops maintained checkpoints in areas under their control. In the south, the
 SLA and IDF maintained tight restrictions on the movement of people and goods
 into and out of the security zone.
 There are some restrictions on foreign travel by Lebanese citizens. Husbands may
 block foreign travel by their wives and minor children. The introduction in 1993 of
 compulsory military service for many males aged between 18 and 21 meant that
 youths subject to the draft are required to register at a recruitment office and obtain
 a travel authorization documentbefore leavng the country. Travel to Israel is ille-
 gal for all Lebanese citizens, but many do so through Israeli-controlled territory in
 
 
 1241
 southern Lebanon. There are no legal restrictions on the right of all citizens to re-
 turn. Many emigres are reluctant to return for a variety of political, economic, and
 social reasons. Palestinian refugees with valid residency papers have the right to
 return to Lebanon.
 The Government began the process of encouraging the return to their homes of
 over 600,000 Lebanese displaced during the civil war. The process was slowed by
 fimancial constraints as well as lingering insecurity felt by the displaced. Hundreds
 of families, however, received keys to their homes and began to repair them. The
 Government concentrated its efforts on returning Christians to areas of the Shuf
 and 'Alayh from which they had fled in the wake of Christian-Druze fighting in the
 mid-1980s.
 Lebanon has historically both generated and received refugees. There are approxi-
 mately 180,000 stateless undocumented persons in Lebanon. Although the families
 of some of them have lived in Lebanon for generations, they suffer broad discrimina-
 tion since they are not accorded the legal rights enjoyed by the rest of the popu-
 lation. They include the inhabitants of border areas in dispute between Lebanon
 and Syria and Lebanon and Israel, Kurds, Syriac Orthodox, and members of other
 sects. These people do not benefit from such government services as the national
 social security fund, and cannot be employed by the Government. Concern about
 preserving sectarian balance was one obstacle to the naturalization of these people
 in the past, In 1993 political support grew for a plan to naturalize a confessionally
 balanced group of non-Palestinian stateless persons who have continuously resided
 in Lebanon for the past 15 years. The Government is reviewing applications.
 Most non-Lebanese refugees in Lebanon are Palestinians. The Government has
 estimated their number at 361,000, but this figure only includes families of refugees
 who arrived in 1948. Some estimates of the actual number of Palestinians in Leb-
 anon now range from 450,000 to 500,000. Although the Government in 1991 ended
 its practice of denying work permits to Palestinians, a strong bias against them con-
 tinues to compel often highly trained Palestinian refugees to take menial work. Pal-
 estinians and other aliens may own land only of a limited size and only after obtain-
 ing the approval of five district offices. The law applies to all aliens, but for political,
 cultural, and economic reasons it is applied in a manner disadvantageous to the Pal-
 estinians and, to a lesser extent, Kurds. Under Lebanese citizenship law, only Leba-
 nese males may transmit citizenship to their spouses and children.
 Lebanon refused to admit 419 Palestinians deported by Israel on December 17,
 1992. The deportees remained in an effective no man's land between Israeli and
 Lebanese controlled territory inside southern Lebanon. The Government turned a
 blind eye to the supply of relief material to the deportees, despite a ban on such
 activity. By the end of 1993, all of the deportees had returned to the Israeli-occu pied
 territories except for about 15 deportees who reportedly elected to remain outside
 the occupied territories to avoid imprisonment.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Lebanon is a parliamentary democracy in which the people have the constitu-
 tional right to change their government. However, until the Parliamentary elections
 in 1992, the people had not been able to exercise this right during 16 years of civil
 war.
 According to the Constitution, direct elections for the Parliament must be held
 every 4 years. The Parliament, in turn, elects the President every 6 years. The
 President and Parliament choose the Cabinet. Political parties may form, and some
 flourish. Since the emergence of the post-1943 state, a relatively restricted group
 of traditional and sectarian leaders largely have determined national policy. The un-
 written 1943 National Pact allocated power on a confessional system based on the
 1932 census. The Pact stipulated that the President would be a Maronite Christian,
 the Prime Minister a Sunni Muslim, and the Speaker of Parliament a Shi'a Muslim.
 Until 1990, seats in Parliament were divided on a 6-to-5 ratio of Christians to Mus-
 lims. Positions in the government were allocated on a similar basis between Chris-
 tians and Muslims.
 Efforts to alter or abolish the confessional system of allocating power were at the
 center of Lebanese politics for more than 3 decades. Those religious groups most fa-
 vored by the 1943 formula sought to preserve it, while those who perceived them-
 selves to be disadvantaged sought to revise it on the basis of different demographic
 data or to abolish it entirely. The struggle gave a strongly sectarian coloration to
 Lebanese politics and to the continuing civil strife in the country. Under the Na-
 tional Reconciliation Agreement reached in Taif, Saudi Arabia in October 1989,
 Members of Parliament agreed to alter the National Pact to create a 50-50 Chris-
 
 
 1242
 tian-Muslim balance in the Parliament and reorder the powers of the different
 branches of government.
 Constitutional amendments embodying the political reforms stipulated in the Taif
 agreement, which represented a dramatic political and psychological change, became
 law in 1990. They included an expansion of the number of seats in Parliament and
 the division of seats equally between Muslims and Christians and the transfer of
 some powers from the President to the Prime Minister and Cabinet. Parliamentary
 elections were held in 1992. The elections were not prepared and not carried out
 in a manner to ensure the broadest national consensus. Because the results do not
 reflect the full spectrum of the body politic in Lebanon, they cast doubt on the abil-
 ity of the Lebanese people to change their government through truly democratic
 means.
 Palestinians in Lebanon, with the exception of the few who have gained Lebanese
 nationality, have no political rights. An estimated 17 Palestinian factions operate
 in Lebanon, ranging from several characterized as "Islamic" to numerous pro- and
 anti-Arafat organizations, many built around prominent individual leaders. Most
 Palestinians live in refugee camps, under the control of one or more political fac-
 tions. Leaders are not elected, and there are no representative institutions that
 would permit popular participation in running camps. Fundamental protections and
 freedoms expected of governments exist in some but not all Palestinian areas.
 There are no legal barriers to participation by women in politics, but the culture
 discourages it. Three women were elected to Parliament in 1992. Two were related
 to deceased politicians, and the third is the sister of the Prime Minister. Very few
 women hold policy-level positions in the Government.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Several local associations are devoted to human rights, including the Foundation
 for Human and Humanitarian Rights, the Lebanese Association for Human Rights
 (headed by a Member of Parliament), and the Lebanese Bar Association's Office for
 Human Rights. The Government does not interfere with the activities of these orga-
 nizations, according to their leaders. There were no known requests by international
 human rights organizations to investigate the situation in Lebanon in 1993, but oc-
 casional inquiries were made. The SLA has refused requests for access by the ICRC
 and other international humanitarian groups to visit the prison it operates at Al-
 Khiyam in southern Lebanon.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 Sixteen years of civil war blocked progress in many social fields, including laws
 and practices on discrimination. In 1993, the Cabinet and Parliament considered
 amendments to laws that discriminate against women, children, and the disabled,
 but no action was taken.
 Women.-Lebanese women, many of whom have professional degrees, can work
 outside the home and increasingly do so out of necessity. The idea that women
 should be supported by men prevails, however, and many, including those with pro-
 fessional training, remain home with their families or until their children are
 grown. Males exercise considerable control over female relatives, often restricting
 such activities outside the home as travel or contact with friends and relatives.
 Women may own property but may not be able to exercise control over it due to
 legal and cultural restrictions. The law stipulates that a woman must obtain the
 prior approval of her husband to open a business or engage in trade. The Judicial
 Institute refused to accept 200 female law graduatee in November, offering no
 grounds for the decision.
 Violence against women occurs, and the press reports frequent cases of rape, but
 judicial authorities have no statistics on the extent of the problem. Doctors and so-
 cial workers believe most abused women do not seek medical help. The society's em-
 phasis on personal privacy and honor makes it difficult for women to seek legal re-
 dress, suggesting that cases reported in the papers are but a fraction of the total
 number. The Government has neither expressed an interest in the problem nor
 made an effort to combat it.
 Each confessional group in Lebanon has its own family and personal status laws
 administered by religious courts, and each group differs in its treatment of mar-
 riage, family property rights, and inheritance. Many of these laws discriminate
 against women. For example, Sunni inheritance law gives a son twice the share of
 a daughter. Although Muslim men can easily divorce, Muslim women can do so only
 with the approval of their husbands. Divorce is difficult for Christians following
 Catholic rites, including Maronites. Many seeking divorce convert to an orthodox

 faith. Parliament approved in November a law that allowed women to testify in
 matters related to land registry. Previously, a woman's testimony had carried only
 half the weight of a man's.
 Children.- -The Government has not placed priority on children's rights and wel-
 fare. There is no evidence of government spending to protect children, although Leb-
 anon has ratified the Children's Rights Charter. The area of children's rights is one
 of many demands made on a state that is just emerging from years of social and
 financial chaos. The plight of children is a growing concern in Lebanon. A huge
 number of children are neglected, abused, exploitedand even sold to disreputable
 adoption agents at a rate of $5,000 for an infant, according to children's rights mon-
 itors. Hundreds of abandoned children are found in the streets, begging and clean-
 ing car windows; others are hired illegally at low wages. Juvenile deb nquency is ris-
 ing. There are 428 cases before the delinquency court in north Lebanon alone, and
 many delinquents wait in ordinary prisons for trial and remain there after sentenc-
 ing. Limited financial resources have hindered efforts to build adequate facilities to
 rehabilitate delinquents.
 Religious Minorities.-Discrimination based on religion is built into the system of
 government (see Section 3). The amended Constitution of 1990 embraces the prin-
 ciple of abolishing confessionalism as a criterion for filling all government positions,
 but no steps have been taken to accomplish this.
 People with Disabilities.-Over 100,000 people were handicapped during the civil
 war. This traditional society has tended to neglect the disabled and handicapped,
 and the concept of rights for the disabled is a novelty for it. Most efforts to secure
 education, independence health and shelter for the disabled were made by private
 institutions dealing with the handicapped, of which there are more than 100
 throughout the country. In the aftermat of the war, the issue of rights for the dis-
 abledhas gained the Government's attention, and in late 1992 a minister was given
 responsibility for handicapped affairs, although he lacked a ministry and financial
 resources. Parliament amended a 1973 law on the disabled, with a view to eliminat-
 ing all obstacles that block equal treatment for the disabled. Even rudimentary
 needs remain unmet, however. Lebanon's heavily damaged cities make no accommo-
 dation to the disabled, and building codes still have no requirements to ease access.
 Facilities for the disabled in most instances are inadequately funded by the Govern-
 ment and various religious institutions, and other charities which run them. In this
 area as in others, the level of public philanthropy is low.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Al workers, except government employees, may
 form and join unions and have a legal right to strike. Worker representatives must
 be chosen from those employed within the bargaining unit. Trade unions may deter-
 mine their own poicies an  pro ram a  a  oas they do not involve themselves in
 politics. About 600,000 persons form the active labor force, many of whom are mem-
 bers of Lebanon's 160 labor unions and associations. Twenty-three of the unions,
 with about 250,000 workers, are represented in the General Confederation of Work-
 ers (CG'TL), 42 percent of the estimated labor force. Lebanese authorities do not con-
 trol or restrict unions, although uaion leaders allege that the Government has tried
 to intervene in elections for union officials. In 1993 the CGTL executive council elec-
 tions resulted in the defeat of CGTL's long-term president. There were credible alle-
 gations that the Labor Minister helped sway electors, encouraged by both leading
 candidates. Palestinians in Lebanon may organize their own unions. Restrictions on
 their right to work in the country, however, make thin right more theoretical than
 real. Few Palestinians participate actively in trade unions in Lebanon.
 Public school teachers, the staff at Lebanese University, Trans-Mediterranean
 Airways employees, and municipal contract workers (principally garbage collectors)
 in several cities including Beint staged a handful of warnin strikes in 1993. The
 longest lasted 3 days. Strikers suspended their walkouts in these cases in response
 to government offers to examine their demands. As of December 31, however, those
 demands were largely unet.
 After months of negotiations and strike threats, CGTL and the Government
 struck a deal in December on a nationwide wage increase.
 Three hundred workers at a private steel factory struck on September 29 over
 management's decision to increase their hours of employment and over alleged in-
 roads on worker's freedom to organize. As of November 1 the strike was unresolved.
 Laws prohibit retribution against strikers and leaders, and there are no known
 cases of such retribution. Two strike leaders among the Beirut municipal contract
 workers, however, were detained by the police for several hours.
 Unions are free to affiliate with international federations and confederations, and
 they maintain a variety of them.

 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The right of workers to orga-
 nize and to bargain exists in law and practice. Most workers' groups engage in some
 form of collective bargaining with their employers. Stronger federations obtain sig-
 nificant gains through their own collective bargaining efforts. Weaker unions rely
 on the mediation of the CGTL, which negotiates across-the-board pay increases with
 private employers' associations. The CGTL often assists unions affdiated with it in
 their bargaining efforts and on occasion has assisted nonunionized workers. There
 is no government mechanism to promote voluntary labor-management negotiations,
 and workers have no protection against antiunion discrimination. While such dis-
 crimination exists, its practical impact on union rights is negligible largely because
 of CGTL activism.
 In May the International Labor Organization (ILO) reviewed a complaint lodged
 by the CGTL against the Government regarding the arrest of striking bank employ-
 ees in 1992. The ILO, noting that the Government had not denied the fact of the
 arrests and had not responded adequately to ILO inquiries, asked the Government
 to safeguard unions' freedom to strike in the future.
 There are no special economic incentives or export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-VWhile not prohibited by law,
 forced labor is not practiced or condoned by the Government. However, children, do-
 mestics, or other foreign workers are sometimes forced to remain in situations
 amounting to coerced or bonded labor.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The 1946 labor code stipulates a
 minimum ago of 8. Workers between the age of 8 and 16 cannot work in excess of
 7 hours, with 1 hour of rest provided after 4 hours. They are also prohibited from
 working between the hours of 7 p.m. and 6 a.m. There is a general prohibition
 against jobs out of proportion with a worker's age." The labor code also prohibits
 certain types of mechanical work for children aged 8 to 13, and other types for those
 aged 13 to 16. The Labor Ministry is tasked with enforcing these requirements, but
 the civil war left it with few resources and a demoralized and sometimes corrupt
 staff. The law is not rigorously applied, and many younger children work in family
 businesses.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The Labor Ministry sets a legal monthly mini-
 mum wage, which was raised in December to about $117 (197,000 Lebanese
 pounds). The law is not enforced effectively in the private sector. In theory the
 courts could be called upon to enforce it, but in practice they are not. Trade unions
 actively try to assure the payment of minimum wages in both the public sector and
 large-scale private sectors, such as teaching and transport. Inflation and currency
 devaluation make it impossible for a worker and family to live on the minimum
 wage; most workers have to earn additional income to make ends meet.
 Labor law prescribes a standard 6-day workweek of 48 hours, with a 24-hour rest
 period per week. In practice, workers in the industrial sector work an average of
 35 hours a week, and workers in other sectors of the economy work an average of
 30 hours a week. The law includes specific occupational health and safety regula-
 tions. Labor reglations call on employees to take adequate precautions for em-
 ployee safety. Enforcement, the responsibility of the Labor Ministry, is uneven.
 abor organizers know of no right of workers to remove themselves from hazardous
 conditions.
