 BRAZIL
 The Government of Brazil is composed of a mixture of civilian
 and military officers headed by a military-supported president;
 Joao Pigueiredo is the fifth retired general to hold that post
 since the 1964 imposition of military rule. President
 Figueiredo, with the support of the military, is pursuing a
 policy intended to restore civilian political control. The
 Congress, which was democratically elected in November 1982, is
 increasingly asserting itself as an independent body.
 Presidential elections are scheduled for 1985.
 Currently the eighth largest economy in the non-communist
 world, Brazil is faced with an approximate 95 billion dollar
 foreign debt, high inflation, and the possibility of continued
 negative growth. In November 1982, popular direct elections
 were held to choose officials at the national, state and local
 levels. The elections were judged by Brazilians and foreign
 observers to have been fair and free of interference. The next
 president is scheduled to be chosen in January, 1985, by an
 electoral college made up of members of the national and state
 legislatures.
 The state of human rights generally continued to improve in
 1983 and the long term trend has been towards fewer
 violations. Brazilians are free to participate actively in the
 political and economic life of the country. Recent strike
 activity that involved violence and destruction of property was
 handled by the police with restraint and due process of law.
 Nevertheless, the Government has constitutionally sanctioned
 emergency powers and powers to issue decree laws. For example,
 in what most observers viewed as an overreaction to public
 demonstrations, the Government issued an emergency decree
 October 19 suspending certain rights of assembly and freedom
 from search for a 60-day period in Brasilia. It expired
 December 17.
 The Brazilian Congress has assumed a more active role in
 national policy-making, especially since the opposition
 political parties gained a majority of seats in the lower house.
 The center of political power, however, still resides in the
 presidency, which can employ numerous constitutional and legal
 devices to moderate the influence of other institutions and to
 assert its will. The executive branch can and does use its
 powers to enforce its policies, though not in a fashion which
 routinely deprives citizens of their human rights. The
 judiciary is widely respected as an independent institution.
 Brazil has a security apparatus composed of a National
 Intelligence Service, a Federal Police system, a militia-type
 State Police responsible for local affairs, and military
 intelligence units. There is a widespread feeling among
 knowledgeable Brazilians that some parts of this apparatus have
 at times been used by the Government to report on certain
 domestic political matters and opposition elements which seemed
 to pose no security threat to the nation. The press and
 friends and relatives have also charged that local police have
 used excessive violence in apprehending and processing alleged
 criminals. However, it does not appear that domestic
 surveillance or occasional police violence is part of a
 concerted government effort to suppress individual rights.

 Brazil has a National Security Law (NSL) which provides for
 military trial of civilians charged under it. This law has
 recently been amended to lessen the number of crimes covered.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Unlawful or Arbitrary Deprivation of Life
 There have been no confirmed incidents of political killings in
 1983. Certain members of the state police in the Sao Paulo
 region were allegedly involved with some 70 killings that began
 in early 1982. Three state policemen have been indicted in
 connection with six of these killings. In its 1983 report,
 Amnesty International noted that in 1982 it had received
 reports of the killing and torture by police of criminal
 suspects. It also stated that it had asked the authorities to
 investigate 'political killings in rural areas' of 'trade union
 leaders and lawyers who had defended peasants involved in local
 land issues' and expressed concern that in 1982 priests,
 peasants, journalists, politicians, and trade unionists had
 been tried in military courts under the National Security Law.
 b. Disappearance
 There have been no reports of politically motivated abductions.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Although the use of torture is prohibited by the Penal Code,
 there continue to be reports that the police sometimes use
 excessive violence and even kill criminal suspects. The
 Government has investigated such allegations and Amnesty
 International states that a former prison director was
 sentenced to five years imprisonment for torture of prisoners.
 There have been no documented instances of politically
 motivated torture. However, church authorities in one
 Brazilian state alleged that soldiers on a training exercise
 captured and tortured a man.
 There have been allegations in the press that policemen held as
 suspects in the 70 killings in the Sao Paulo region in 1982
 were tortured in prison by the state police in order to extract
 confessions.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The independent judiciary is largely successful in guaranteeing
 legal processes for citizens. Under Brazilian law, an
 individual may not be arbitrarily detained. Habeas corpus is
 guaranteed by the Brazilian constitution and is respected.
 Preventive detention, often called "provisionary arrest,, is
 permissible under the Brazilian Penal Code of 1940. It is
 ordered by judges or certain administrative authorities, not by
 police. A judge may order detention, for example, to preserve
 public order in cases where the evidence of guilt is clear-cut;
 e.g., when a perpetrator is caught in the act, or to prevent
 
 
 486
 interference in due process; e.g., when the person detained
 might harm witnesses. Detention can be extended until the case
 comes to trial or until a judge rules that reasons for
 detention no longer exist. Preventive detention is also
 invoked for vagrancy and in extradition cases. In practice,
 preventive detention in Brazil is not considered to be
 arbitrary and does not appear to lead to long periods of
 incarceration.
 Individuals may also be detained for alleged violations of the
 NSL. In these cases, the accused may be held in custody for 30
 days and kept incommunicado for 5 days. The 30-day period may
 be renewed by a judicial authority. If, however, an arrest is
 made, a judicial authority must be immediately notified, just
 as in all other arrests. In Brazilian judicial practice this
 means within 24 hours. The judge must then make a
 determination of the legality of the arrest. When the judicial
 authority is notified, the police are required to inform the
 prisoner of the charges against him. If the prisoner was
 detained illegally, an attorney may file a habeas corpus
 request on behalf of the prisoner. This can lead to punishment
 of the police authorities who illegally detained the prisoner.
 Deadlines for notifications and determinations in national
 security cases are strictly adhered to. In December 1983, 20
 provisions of the NSL were retroactively revoked. All charges
 under these 20 provisions were dropped. In 1983, there was one
 arrest, trial, and conviction under the NSL of a journalist in
 Parana.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Brazilian law guarantees the defendant the right to a fair
 public trial. This requirement is respected in practice in
 cases involving violations of both penal and National Security
 law. Defendants are entitled to counsel, which is provided
 free if they are unable to afford it. Defendants must be made
 fully aware of the charges against them. They, along with
 their attorneys, also have the legal right to be informed of
 the evidence on which the charges are based. Cases may be
 tried before a single judge or by jury. In cases of willful
 crimes against life, a jury trial is mandated.
 The Brazilian judicial system is an independent branch of
 government. The highest court is the Federal Supreme Court.
 Brazil's federal court system is composed of courts of the
 first instance and appeals courts. States organize their own
 judicial systems which must not violate basic principles
 established by the federal constitution. In addition, Brazil
 has a system of specialized courts, such as labor courts,
 electoral courts, and juvenile courts.
 Brazil has a military court system that is responsible for
 hearing cases involving military personnel and cases involving
 civilians who are charged with offenses under the National
 Security Law or against military institutions. Legal
 guarantees such as habeas corpus also apply in military
 courts. Civilians convicted of crimes against national
 security have the right of appeal to the Federal Supreme Court.
 Military personnel convicted of the same offenses are allowed
 only in extraordinary circumstances to appeal to the Federal
 Supreme Court. Increasingly, the military courts are
 dismissing National Security Law cases or referring these cases
 to the civilian legal system. Congress recently passed and the
 
 
 487
 President signed into law a bill amending the NSL. The new law
 reduces by roughly half the number of crimes covered. It makes
 several procedural adjustments favorable to defendants and
 reduces the number of officials who can invoke the NSL'S
 provisions regarding alleged "crimes against honor".
 Approximately 17 individuals were released when the National
 Security Law was recently amended. one person is currently
 known to have been convicted and imprisoned under the NSL.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home or
 Correspondence
 The Government does not generally intrude into the private
 lives of individuals. However, there have been allegations in
 the press that the Brazilian Government, through the widespread
 use of warrantless wiretaps by its National Intelligence
 Service, has monitored the activities of opposition elements.
 There have been no documented instancek of unauthorized entry
 into individuals' homes, however, and there is no evidence that
 the Government routinely monitors correspondence. Although
 freedom from search is constitutionally guaranteed, this
 freedom was suspended by Decree Law for 60 days in late 1983 in
 the Federal District of Brasilia.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Brazilian Constitution guarantees the right to free speech
 and a free press. The new National Security Law no longer
 makes it a criminal offense to divulge 'false or tendentious
 statements, or true, partial, or distorted facts in a manner to
 turn or attempt to turn people against constitutional
 authorities.*
 Recently, the Government suggested that a deputy be removed
 from the Congress for making unsubstantiated charges of
 criminality by the government leadership. The Congress
 censured the deputy but did not take away his seat.
 Under a still valid provision of the NSL, an editor convicted
 of publishing 'subversive propaganda* is currently serving a
 four year sentence. His 1982 conviction followed the
 publication in his newspaper of articles critical of government
 officials and local landowners in land ownership cases. In
 September 1983, the Supreme Military Tribunal, during an
 appeal, lengthened the original two year sentence to four
 years. The editor is also appealing that decision.
 Newspapers are privately owned as are radio and television
 stations. In the printed media there is open and vigorous
 debate on government policies and performance. The electronic
 media broadcasts discussions on controversial social and
 political topics. Even when the NSL was more inclusive than it
 is now in its amended form, the political opposition and press
 often criticized the Government.
 There were, however, allegations that the Government has
 withheld its advertising from publishers who print unfavorable
 articles, significantly reducing their revenues. The
 Government denied these allegations, responding that it had
 reduced advertising for economic reasons, not in order to
 punish opposition publishers.

 488
 Foreign publications are widely distributed in both the
 original language and in translation. Foreign and domestic
 films are reviewed for political content. This censorship, in
 rare instances, results in a film being barred from commercial
 distribution.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Freedom to assemble peacefully is assured by the Constitution.
 This freedom can be suspended through Decree Law, as it was for
 60 days in. the federal district of Brasilia from October 19 to
 December 17. In the one case growing out of this suspension,
 government authorities invaded the premises of the Organization
 of Lawyers of Brazil and confiscated tapes of their meetings.
 The incident resulted in outcries from public and press.
 The right of assembly is withheld from political parties that
 are constitutionally deemed illegal. To receive legal status
 parties must, in the judgement of governmental authorities, be
 based on plurality and a democratic approach, be free of links
 to foreign governments or parties, and be national in scope.
 Nevertheless, the Government normally permits the assembly of
 non-legal groups, such as the country's various communist
 parties. However, such tolerance is not guaranteed. In
 December 1982, the government detained approximately 60
 Brazilian Communist Party leaders holding a national-level
 meeting in Sao Paulo. All were quickly released.
 Labor unions have the right to organize, bargain collectively,
 and strike. However, strikes are not legally permitted in
 economic sectors stated by the Government to be essential to
 national security. These sectors are broadly defined and
 include a significant portion of the economy. The Government
 also has broad powers under the Consolidated Labor Code. These
 make it possible for the Government to limit organized labor by
 such action as taking over negotiations, stopping strikes, and
 replacing union officials. For example, during 1983, the
 Government took moves against five labor unions because of
 strikes which it deemed illegal under the labor code,
 considering them either politically motivated or a threat to
 state security. Officers of the unions were removed and
 government-named intervenors were placed in charge of the
 unions.
 Labor unions stepped up their activities in 1983 to deal with
 opposed layoffs and salary restraints resulting from Brazil's
 economic crisis. Major strikes were staged, and the unions
 began to lobby Congress and negotiate more assiduously with
 employers. Labor leaders made an effort to establish a
 National Workers Central composed of unions and federations of
 unions from a wide range of industrial sectors. But only a
 limited organization was effected due to differences within the
 labor movement. The Government has not moved to curtail the
 newly created National Workers Central even though it considers
 it to be illegal.
 Unions can be permanently allied with international
 organizations only when such affiliation is approved by the
 President within certain legal guidelines. The second biggest
 confederation in Brazil, the Commercial Workers Confederation,
 is approved as a member of the Regional Organization of
 Commercial Workers, an ILO organization. However, the
 
 
 489
 President has not yet approved international affiliations for a
 number of unions awaiting permission, reportedly because the
 international organizations were considered by the Government
 to be too radical.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 There are no restrictions on the practice of religion in
 Brazil, and there is no state religion. An overwhelming
 majority of Brazilians belong to the Roman Catholic church.
 All faiths are free to proselytize, and there is no
 disadvantage to adhering to a particular religious belief.
 Although there had been some tension between the Catholic
 Church and the Government regarding the Church's political and
 social activism, in 1983 there was no reported government
 intervention in Church programs.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel,
 Emigration, and Repatriation
 Currently there are no restrictions on movement within Brazil or
 any unusual restrictions on emigration. Brazil admits relatively
 few immigrants. The decision on admission is based primarily on
 the geographical proximity of the applicant's homeland, cultural
 affinity, and Brazil's ability to absorb newcomers. Brazil is
 also selective in granting asylum, but Brazilian law does not
 provide precise criteria. Brazil does not forcibly repatriate
 refugees to their homelands nor restrict the repatriation of
 Brazilians.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to
 Change Their Government
 The President holds a preponderance of political power which is
 ultimately guaranteed by the armed forces, especially the army.
 Nevertheless, the influence of Congress has steadily grown during
 the past year, to the point where it was able to defeat several
 important Government-sponsored proposals.
 Direct elections were held November 15, 1982 for most national and
 local offices. In the elections, about 55 million Brazilians
 voted in a free and vigorously contested campaign, choosing
 representatives for over 40,000 elected positions. Elected were
 the entire Chamber of Deputies, one third of the Senate, all state
 governors, mayors, and members of city councils. In the Chamber
 of Deputies the party supporting the Government, the Social
 Democratic Party (PDS), won 235 seats, compared with 244 for the
 four opposition parties together. In the Chamber of Deputies
 there are now 36 members who had previously had their political
 rights or mandates cancelled. The PDS continues to have a
 majority in the Senate, with 45 members compared with 24 from the
 three opposition parties. The Congress now represents all
 segments of society; men, women and the major racial groups.
 The opposition parties won 10 of the 23 state governorships. The
 major opposition party, the Brazilian Democratic Movement (PMDB).,
 won nine of the Governorships, including those of the two largest
 states, Sao Paulo and Minas Gerais. Former exile Leonel Brizola,
 running at the head of the ticket for the small opposition
 Democratic Workers Party (PDT), won the Governorship of Rio de
 Janeiro.
 
 
 490
 Brazilians are free to join the five political parties which the
 Government currently recognizes. These parties encompass a wide
 and representative sample of Brazilian political opinion and
 social groups.
 Voting is secret and mandatory for adult literates; illiterates
 (about 24% of the adult population) may not vote. The 1982
 elections were generally acknowledged to be free of significant
 fraud. Before the elections, members of the opposition charged
 that the Government had changed some of the election rules to
 increase the vote for the government party, but it is not clear
 that the rule changes significantly affected the election
 results. Access to radio and television for campaign purposes is
 strictly controlled, with the legally-recognized parties given
 equal access. Other types of campaign propaganda such as
 bill-boards, printed advertisements, leaflets, and posters are
 liberally used.
 Since the election, the Congress has established itself as an
 independent political institution whose views must be taken
 into account by the government in formulating national policy.
 The power of the Congress was clearly demonstrated in October,
 1983, when it rejected important government decree-laws on wage
 controls. On this critical issue of economic policy, the
 Government has successfully negotiated with the Congress in
 seeking an accord that has majority support. The Congress has
 also conducted inquiries into allegations of government
 corruption and mismanagement.
 The election results of November 1982 has determined the
 membership of the electoral college that is charged with
 electing the next president and vice president in January
 1985. Under current legislation, the electoral college will
 consist of the full federal congress plus six representatives
 from each state legislature. The opposition has charged that
 the Government designed this system so that the government
 party would have a majority in the electoral college even if it
 did not receive a majority of the popular vote in the. 1982
 elections.
 Section 4 Government Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 During the past year, there have been no reported requests by
 representatives from international human rights organizations
 to investigate conditions in Brazil.
 A number of Brazilian non-governmental organizations
 investigate and make public alleged human rights violations.
 When appropriate, they initiate legal proceedings. The most
 active groups in this area have been the National Conference of
 Brazilian (Catholic) Bishops-, the National Bar Association and
 its local chapters, the Brazilian Press Association, and
 'Justice and peace" groups. In September 1983, the Governor of
 Rio de Janeiro state asked the Council of Justice, Public
 Security and Human Rights to provide advice and guidance on
 policy-making with regard to human rights in his state. The
 council includes representatives from the state, private human
 rights groups, women, blacks, young people, and journalists.
 Brazil is not a party to the Inter-Knerican Convention on Human
 Rights, but is a party to a number of United Nations human
 
 
 491
 rights conventions, including the conventions on genocide,
 racial discrimination, refugees, and the political rights of
 married women.
 Freedom House in 1983 rated Brazil as 'partly free.'
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 Last year Brazil experienced the third consecutive year of
 economic stagnation. Gross Domestic Product fell by
 approximately five percent in 1983. Inflation during the year
 surpassed 200 percent. Unemployment rose;gindustrial
 production fell. The country was in arrears on payments of its
 $95 billion foreign debt, keeping Brazil in the position of the
 third world's largest debtor. The Government has centralized
 external payments in order to prioritize the use of its foreign
 exchange, and particularly, to meet its petroleum import
 costs.
 Most economists foresee more austerity ahead with the economy
 experiencing little real growth for several years. The major
 bright spot in the economy was a trade surplus approaching
 $6 1/2 billion in 1983.
 Although evidence suggests that all social strata benefited
 from the country's economic growth during the 1970's, uneven
 income distribution remains a serious social problem. In 1981
 Gross National Product per capita was $2,212. However,
 according to government statistics, between 1970-80 the
 wealthiest 20 percent of the population increased their share
 of national income from 61 percent to 63 percent while the
 share received by the poorest 60 percent fell from 21.1 percent
 to 19.7 percent. Regional income differences are also marked.
 The South-Southwest receives 82 percent of national income yet
 has slightly more than 50 percent of the population.
 Brazil has had and continues to have a large rural-to-urban
 migration. As a result, seventy percent of Brazil's
 approximately 122,000,000 inhabitants live within 100
 kilometers of the coast, and nearly 30 percent are concentrated
 in nine urban areas. The government has encouraged settlement
 in the western frontier areas, however. Annual population
 growth rate has been about 2.3 percent.
 Life expectancy at birth is estimated at 62.8 years. The World
 Bank estimates current infant mortality at 68 per 1000 live
 births. However, officials in several Northeastern states
 estimate their infant mortality rates at well over 200,
 primarily due to the area's chronic poverty and sub-standard
 health facilities, exacerbated by continuing severe drought.
 Health personnel and health facilities are concentrated in
 urban areas and the industrial southeast, which accounts for 80
 percent of the physicians, 73 percent of the nursing personnel,
 and 79 percent of the hospital beds. The Government is
 attempting to improve safety and health conditions in the work
 place.
 Significant portions of the society lack adequate nutrition,
 potable water, basic education, and medical care. Illustrative
 of this are the findings of a 1980 Brazilian congressional
 inquiry which indicated that Brazil has two million abandoned
 children and 18 to 25 million children without the basic
 
 
 492
 necessities of life. In 1977, 89 percent of those eligible were
 enrolled in primary school. The Ministry of Education
 estimates that some seven million school-age children are not
 being reached by the educational system.
 Discrimination on the basis of sex and race is illegal.
 Nevertheless, the number of women and members of most minority
 groups in the governing structure is much smaller than their
 proportional share of the population. Their relative
 under-representation reflects prevailing cultural attitudes and
 economic disparities.
 The country's estimated 200,000 Indians, living mostly in the
 interior, have suffered in recent decades from gradual
 encroachment of Brazil's coastal population and from the
 Government's effort to promote economic development in frontier
 areas where most Indians live. The increasing contact between
 Indians and newcomers has caused occasional conflict. The
 Figueiredo administration has renewed the Government's
 commitment under the 1973 Indian Statute to protect the Indian
 population. In addition, the federal Indian Affairs Agency has
 been demarcating tribal lands. These should provide a greater
 measure of security for the Indians. Nevertheless, the Indian
 population continues to suffer from governmental neglect,
 discriminatory governmental controls and unequal legal status
 ir areas such as citizenship, voting and the right to hold
 office.
