 IRAQ
 Since gaining its independence in 1932, Iraq has passed
 through several periods of instability and violence. The
 current government, which came to power by coup in 1968,
 presides over an ethnically and religiously diverse
 society.
 Iraq broke diplomatic relations with the United States
 during the 1967 Arab-Israeli war. The United States
 maintains an interests section in Baghdad.
 The wealth generated by Iraq's oil reserves is being
 invested to a large degree in health and education ser-
 vices, transportation, and non-petroleum sectors of the
 economy. A substantial portion goes to the military
 establishment. The provisional constitution guarantees
 individual rights, but in practice they are subordinated
 to the interests of the state and society. Political
 rights are sharply limited and little dissent is tolerated.
 Media censorship is endemic. There are few dependable
 sources of information about many government practices.
 Activities that the state considers to be threats to its
 security can lead to detention without charges, severe
 prison sentences, mistreatment, torture, and execution.
 The government does not facilitate outside investigations
 of alleged human rights violations.
 1980 witnessed the outbreak of war with Iran. Both
 before and immediately after hostilities began, large
 numbers of Iraqis of Iranian decent were deported.
 Because of the need for manpower in Iraq, the freedom
 of travel outside Iraq, particularly for those of'
 military age and those skilled in the professions,
 has been curtailed. Despite the war, the government
 continued to pursue its programs for the economic and
 social development of the country.
 1.   Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 Persons arrested for political reasons are likely to be
 tortured or mistreated. In its 1981 annual report, Amnesty
 International expressed concern about "the use of torture
 to extract confessions during interrogation." Although
 article 22(A) of the constitution prohibits torture, cred-
 ible allegations persist that both severe physical and
 psychological torture are used during interrogations.
 Beatings with rubber hoses or planks, suspension from a
 ceiling fan, and electric shock treatment have been
 reported. Psychological maltreatment is said to include
 threatening prisoners with loaded weapons, playing tape
 recordings of torture sessions, and threatening members
 of the prisoner's family in his presence.

 In April 1981, Amnesty International published extracts
 of medical findings on fifteen individuals who had spent
 from one day to nine months in detention in Iraq between
 1976 and 1979. Although the fifteen were arrested at
 different times and places, their accounts showed a uni-
 form pattern of torture, and doctors found the medical
 evidence consistent with the accounts. Among the reported
 instances of torture were hanging by handcuffed wrists,
 burns by cigarettes and special tools, repeated beatings
 on the soles of feet, sexual molestation, threats of rape,
 and mock executions. One journalist testified that he had
 been subjected to the burning of his knuckles so that he
 could not write again.
 In 1981, an expert's report to the United Nations Sub-
 commission on Human Rights in Geneva stated that reports
 of death under torture in Iraq are frequent. Political
 detainees have been killed, and their mutilated bodies
 returned near to their families' homes, according to the
 expert. No evidence is available to indicate that those
 who employ torture are disciplined by the government.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Degrading treatment is reportedly practiced immediately
 following arrest and during interrogation, especially
 when security matters are involved. Reportedly, such
 treatment is usually discontinued after completion of
 investigation or sentencing.
 Prison conditions for convicted criminals are better than
 those for detainees: they can have food provided from
 the outside and have access to some medical services.
 Temporary detention facilities reportedly are crowded and
 unsanitary. Security suspects are not allowed to see
 either relatives or attorneys until after their interro-
 gation is finished. Security suspects past the interro-
 gation stage, or persons charged with common felonies,
 usually can receive visitors, including attorneys.
 Prisoners are jailed in groups according to length of
 sentences. Amnesty International continues to express
 its concern over what it considers to be the large number
 of executions which take place in Iraq. Because few exe-
 cutions are officially reported, estimates are difficult
 to make. According to Amnesty International those exe-
 cuted for political reasons frequently include Kurds
 charged with political or military involvement in the
 Kurdish resistance and members of the armed forces
 charged with anti-Ba'athist political activity.
 In 1981 there were creditable reports of government-
 directed assassinations of Iraqi dissidents in other
 countries.
 
 
 c. Disappearances
 Abductions without warning are reportedly carried out by
 the secret police in Iraq, particularly in cases of sus-
 pected subversion, which would appear to be broadly
 defined. Family members rarely know where or why these
 relatives are being held. Reportedly, it is difficult
 to learn whether there has been an execution, or whether
 the missing person has died by torture. In a recent
 case, it was only after the persistent intercession of
 well-placed relatives and friends that the remains were
 released to the family for proper burial. The government
 appears to take no steps to curtail these practices.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 Citizens in Iraq are subject to arbitrary arrest. Criminal
 suspects are protected by right of habeas corpus; political
 detainees are not. Information concerning the number of
 political detainees is inconclusive.
 Of all the reports concerning arrests, those relating to
 Kurds are the most numerous. In 1979, Amnesty International
 issued a report alleging the imprisonment or detention of
 760 Kurds. In some cases, these include the families
 of persons sought by the government, but not yet found.
 Amnesty International also has received the names of 200
 Kurds who have allegedly been executed in the last several
 years. In June 1981, it received reports that 27 Iraqi
 Kurds from the autonomous region of Kurdistan were sen-
 tenced to death by the special military court in Kirkuk.
 Iraq specifically excluded most Kurdish collaborators from
 its 1978 amnesty of political prisoners. However, in its
 1979 amnesty of political prisoners, some 400 persons
 associated with Kurdish opposition activities were included.
 It is likely that some Kurdish prisoners still remain in
 detention.
 A mass relocation of Kurds took place at the end of the
 Kurdish rebellion in 1975. The government created a
 thirty-six kilometer wide security zone along much of the
 borders with Iran and Turkey. It moved Kurds and other
 groups living in the zone from their houses to distant
 areas. Most of those forcibly relocated have been allowed
 to return to the north, although not to their original
 villages. Most have been resettled in government-built
 centers.
 In August 1979, Iraq offered a special amnesty to Iraqi
 Kurds outside the country who wished to lay down their
 arms and return. Expatriate Kurds, especially those in
 Iran, responded more positively to this offer than to
 similar offers in the past, which they had greeted with
 great skepticism. Five well-known Kurds prominently
 
 
 986
 associated with the 1974-1975 rebellion returned in
 December 1979 to Iraq, where they have been appointed as
 counselors to the Kurdish affairs bureau of the Iraqi
 revolutionary command council. There are unconfirmed
 reports that as many as 10,000 of the Kurds who fled
 following the collapse of the 1974-1975 rebellion have
 returned under this special amnesty.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Trials in civil, criminal and religious courts are open.
 Defendants in these courts are entitled to counsel; a
 lawyer is provided if a defendant cannot afford one.
 Charges and evidence are available for review. Appellate
 courts try cases which do not come under the jurisdiction
 of the revolutionary courts. Closed trials are the rule
 in the revolutionary courts, which hear such crimes as
 espionage, treason, smuggling and drug trafficking.
 Closed, too, are the "special courts" constituted by the
 revolutionary command council for specific incidents,
 such as the reported conspiracy against the regime in
 1979. Amnesty International reports that these special
 tribunals are not bound by the safeguards guaranteed by
 Iraqi domestic law, since the defendants are held in-
 communicado, the right of defense is proscribed, and
 convictions may be based upon confessions extracted by
 torture. These violations are also not in compliance
 with the International Convenant on Civil and Political
 Rights which the Iraqi government ratified on January 25,
 1971. Appeals can be taken only to the chairman of the
 revolutionary command council, the president. However,
 the availability of this appeal may be ineffective,
 since there are reports that executions take place
 shortly after trial.
 f. Invasion of the Home
 The provision in the constitution of July 16, 1970,
 protecting inviolability of the home is reinforced by
 strong cultural values. The law requires police to
 obtain a search warrant before entering the home of a
 felony suspect. The law fails to extend similar pro-
 tection to security suspects. Arrests usually occur
 outside the home and allegations of illegal entry
 are rare. Wiretapping occurs.
 2.   Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 The government views any form of political dissent as a
 threat to the security of the country, and controls the
 exercise of the rights of speech, press and assembly.
 The constitution prohibits "any act aimed at undermining
 the national unity of the people, provoking radical,
 sectarian, and regional bigotry or violating gains and
 achievements of the country."
 
 
 987
 The media are government owned or government controlled.
 The press, radio and television receive daily guidance
 from the government; they are not permitted to criticize
 the government or its policies. Media which fail to
 follow government guidelines are suspended, as was the
 Iraqi Communist Party paper in April 1981. Foreign
 periodicals, books and movies are screened and censored
 before distribution.
 Iraq is an ethnically and religiously diverse society.
 The government, which has been dominated by the Sunni
 Muslim Arab minority, pursues a secular policy aimed at
 assimilating its various ethnic and religious groups,
 including the Jewish, Yezidi, and Christian minorities
 and the Shi'a majority. In some instances, thib takes
 the form of trying to wean groups away from their cul-
 tural traditions, languages, ethnic identity and way of
 life, although the government seems recently to have
 tempered its policies in this regard.
 Iraq's Christians constitute about 500,000 people, or about
 4 percent of the population. They enjoy freedom of worship
 in churches of established Christian denominations, which
 receive some support from the state, but not freedom to
 proselytize or hold meetings outside church premises. Con-
 vents and monasteries exist and some new church construction
 has been undertaken. In early 1980, the government insti-
 tuted obligatory Koranic studies for all students, including
 non-Muslims. The measure was withdrawn after it met with
 vigorous opposition from the Christian community and from
 visiting Arab-American groups.
 The Chaldeans, long-time urban residents, are the wealthiest
 and the best educated of the Christian groups. Some occupy
 mid-level government positions. Syriac Christians are often
 found in the lower ranks of the civil service. Armenians
 are concentrated in private business. Assyrian Christians,
 often less educated, and more recent arrivals from rural
 areas, are, on the whole, poorer than the other groups.
 The Shi'a Muslims who make up a majority of the population
 have felt economically and socially disadvantaged by the
 governing Sunnis. In connection with the Iranian-inspired
 terrorist attacks on senior government and Ba'ath Party
 officials in 1980, members of the Shi'a community were the
 target of a major campaign of arrests, executions, and
 expulsions. The government allows such Shi'a religious
 practices as public flagellation and public gatherings,
 which it had prohibited prior to an outbreak of severe
 Shi'a disturbances in 1977.
 The Jewish community in Iraq is believed to number fewer
 than 300. The extent of the community's religious activity
 and other liberties is not known. Although the last of
 some 200 Freemasons imprisoned in 1973-1974 were amnestied
 in July 1979, some members of the Baha'i sect may still be
 
 
 .988
 imprisoned. Organized activities by Freemasons and Baha'is
 are prohibited.
 The Balath Party uses several mass organizations to assist
 in maintaining its control over the country. Voluntary
 associations and trade unions are not free. All public
 meetings must be approved by the government. While labor
 unions theoretically have the right to strike, they could
 do so only with official sanction.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration and Repatriation
 Sensitive border and other security areas are off limits.
 Because of the war with Iran, many parts of the country,
 particularly in the southeast, are reserved for the military.
 There are police checkpoints on highways and outside every
 major town, but most Iraqis and foreigners travel freely in
 non-restricted areas. Foreign diplomats must obtain permits
 from the foreign ministry for travel to areas outside of
 Baghdad, but these are usually granted.
 Iraqi passport fees are reasonable. All Iraqis wishing to
 travel abroad are required to obtain exit permission.
 Citizens are usually limited to one trip per year outside
 of the Arab world. Individuals who have records of political
 activity may find it difficult to obtain travel documents;
 many wait years to receive exit visas. In 1981, because of
 the war, Iraq imposed a travel ban on all Iraqi males
 between the ages of 18 and 45, with only a few exceptions
 granted. Medical doctors working for the government also
 were precluded from travel, regardless of age. It is
 extremely difficult for highly skilled technicians or
 specialist engineers to leave the country. Travel to the
 United States requires specific permission.
 Students and teachers may leave the country only during
 school vacations; government officials may only travel
 abroad during official vacations. A married woman must
 have the permission of her husband to travel. The govern-
 ment can also require a prospective Iraqi traveller to
 post substantial bonds to assure return. If students on
 scholarship abroad do not return, their families must
 repay the costs of the education.
 Although there are no formal restrictions on emigration,
 many Iraqis attempt to leave the country surreptitiously.
 Many leave behind substantial property because of the
 difficulty of transferring assets out of the country.
 Penalties for violating exchange laws can be severe.
 Most foreigners who reside in Iraq can obtain entry and
 exit permission with little difficulty. The maximum
 allowable stay for a foreigner in Iraq is five years.
 
 
 989
 In February 1980 the revolutionary command council passed
 a resolution requiring alien spouses of Iraqi citizens,
 who had resided in Iraq for five years, to naturalize or
 to leave the country without their families. The govern-
 ment is systematically carrying out this law against the
 will of these aliens, by either not permitting exit from
 the country or by confiscating their residence permits
 until naturalization is completed.
 Iraq rarely practices banishment or exile. However, over
 30,000 Iranians and Iraqis of Iranian descent were sum-
 marily expelled to Iran in April 1980, and thousands of
 others were reportedly expelled subsequently. In recent
 years, the government instituted special programs to en-
 courage qualified professionals to return to the country.
 Aliens of Iraqi origin can apply for a document which will
 permit them to enter and exit Iraq without procuring a
 visa.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 There are three legal parties: the ruling Ba'ath Party
 and two Kurdish parties. Together they constitute the
 Patriotic and Progressive National Front (PPNF)--essentially
 a vehicle of support for the government. The two non-Ba'ath
 parties carry on only limited activity. Members of the
 Iraqi military or security services may engage in political
 activities only within the Ba'ath Party. Membership in the
 party is not required for appointment to senior government
 positions, but normally is necessary for political success.
 Opposition groups are severely repressed. The outlawed
 Da'wa Party (Shi'a religious-oriented) bore the brunt of
 the regime's persecution of rival political parties in
 1980. Membership or association in the group, which has
 engaged in anti-regime terrorism, bears the penalty of
 execution. The Communist Party was removed from the PPNF
 and declared illegal in 1979.
 Elections for a national assembly were held in June 1980,
 the first general elections since the overthrow of the
 monarchy in 1958. Although voters could choose from among
 many candidates, all candidates were carefully screened by
 the government before the campaigns. Voter turnout among
 women as well as men was heavy and 16 women were elected to
 the assembly. Members of the assembly are not required to
 join the Ba'ath Party; however, they must pledge allegiance
 to the principles of the Ba'ath Revolution.
 Such government officials as mayors and provincial governors
 are appointed by the central government.
 Trade unions function primarily as social welfare organiza-
 tions. Their essentially governmental character makes them
 a channel of Ba'ath Party influence over the work force.
 Union membership is a prerequisite for employment in many
 sectors.
 
 
 990
 3.   Government Attitudes and Record Regarding International
 and Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Itaq is a member of the United Nations Commission on Human
 Rights, and Baghdad has hosted human rights conferences.
 For instance, from May 18 to May 20, 1979, Iraq hosted a
 "symposium on human rights and fundamental freedoms in the
 Arab homeland," sponsored by the Arab Jurists Federation,
 headquartered in Baghdad.
 Iraq has not permitted outside investigations of alleged
 human rights violations and has had little contact with
 foreign non-governmental human rights organizations. No
 human rights monitoring groups are known to exist within
 the country. Iraq did respond to Amnesty International's
 April 1981 report concerning the testimonies, case
 histories, and medical evaluations of fifteen Iraqis who
 were allegedly tortured in various places in Iraq in the
 late seventies. Iraq described the report as *without
 foundation," citing not only international accords to
 which it is a party or to which it adheres in principle,
 but also various constitutional and other domestic provi-
 sions of law protecting the rights of Iraqis. However,
 Amnesty International contends that the government did not
 reply in detail to the specific allegations of torture in
 the report.
 Iraq did receive the President of the International Committee
 of the Red Cross (ICRC) in 1981, as well as other visits by
 ICRC delegates, to discuss the treatment of prisoners of war
 and the protection of civilian persons in the context of the
 conflict between Iraq and Iran. An ICRC delegation based in
 Baghdad made monthly visits to Iranian prisoners of war and
 assisted in the repatriation of some 25 Iranian and Iraqi
 prisoners of war. The delegates also visited the Iraqi-
 occupied territories in Iran, although ICRC activities
 there were limited by Iraqi authorities citing security
 concerns. Despite the expressions by Iraqi officials of
 their government's intention to comply strictly with its
 obligations under the Third and Fourth Geneva Conventions
 relative to the treatment of prisoners of war, the ICRC
 reported that as of the end of June it had not been able
 to obtain access to all the Iranian prisoners of war. It
 is understood that there had been no change in this situa-
 tion as of the end of December.
 4.   Economic and Social Circumstances
 The Ba'ath regime, throughout the seventies, made substan-
 tial progress in improving the standard of living of Iraqis
 by concentrating on education, health and welfare reforms.
 While the most evident gains have taken place in urban
 areas, many government policies focus on assisting rural
 dwellers.
 
 
 991
 Iraq has a socialist, centrally-controlled economy. Major
 industries, including petroleum, are state-owned. Gross
 national product per capita almost quadrupled during the
 seventies, from $630 to $2,410. Much of this increase,
 however, represents a pro rats share of accumulated foreign
 reserves resulting from higher oil prices. The government
 has earmarked many of its oil earnings for development of
 projects, rather than for increases in consumer purchasing
 power. Wage increases slightly lead the 15-17 per cent
 inflation rate. Urban dwellers have experienced the great-
 est relative rise in their standard of living. In the
 period 1976-1979, 40 percent of the rural population re-
 mained below the absolute poverty level. While in 1981
 the country's oil production was estimated to have dropped
 to about a third of pre-war production, the country's
 economy continues to perform much as before, primarily
 because of large subsidies from Saudi Arabia and Kuwait.
 Although a large portion of national income is spent on
 defense, between 1978 and 1979 the human resources alloca-
 tion of the budget grew at a faster rate than that of
 defense: reaching 58 percent vs. 26 percent in 1979. Due
 to the war with Iran, military expenditures took an in-
 creased share of the budget in 1981.
 Health care is free or provided at a token fee. Although
 serious shortages of qualified personnel persist, medical
 professionals and workers increased from 9,000 in 1968 to
 over 40,000 in 1980. The number of medical and nursing
 training institutions increased in the same period from
 three to sixty-five. There was one doctor per 2,000
 persons in 1980.
 Life expectancy at birth has increased from 51.7 years in
 1969-71 to 56.1 years in 1976-79, with infant mortality
 rates decreasing in the same period from 21.9 to 15.7 per
 1,000 live births and an overall population growth rate
 increase of 3.1 to 3.3 percent. (There were 6.7 live
 births per thousand females in 1979.) These gains are ex-
 plained not only by improved health care, but also by an
 increase in urban and rural access to safe drinking water.
 In rural areas the percentage of the population with access
 to safe drinking water has doubled in roughly the last ten
 years. Some 90 percent of the urban population has access
 to water which has been filtered, chemically treated, and
 piped into homes or communal fountains.
 Education is free through the university level, and the
 government offers a wide range of scholarships for ad-
 vanced study abroad. In the last ten years, the number
 of primary and secondary schools has more than doubled,
 as has enrollment, with female enrollment, especially
 at the primary level, accounting in large part for the
 dramatic rise. The number of students in vocational
 schools and universities has increased markedly. The
 government claims that in the course of implementing
 
 
 992
 the Anti-illiteracy Law of 1976, it has raised Iraq's
 literacy rate to 70 percent.
 The land reform program has ended the feudal system of the
 past but has not yet replaced it with a viable system. A
 government program to impose collective farms, on the east
 European model, was abandoned by President Saddam Hussein
 in April 1981, and land has been returned to private
 ownership. Substantial funds for agricultural loans to
 single family units have been authorized.
 Heavy migration to the cities has resulted in substandard
 living conditions there. Numerous public housing projects
 are under construction. An extensive system of subsidies
 and controls keeps the prices for food staples, utilities
 and transportation reasonably low.
 The government has made substantial efforts to improve the
 status of women in Iraq and to enhance their participation
 in the work force, both in terms of numbers and level of
 skill. Women are guaranteed, by law, equal employment and
 educational opportunity, equal pay, equal rights in property
 and business owership. Increasing numbers of women are
 joining the work force in a wide range of occupations. In
 1980, the Air Force College admitted its first group of
 female pilot trainees. A personal status law of February
 1978 permits women to institute divorce proceedings and
 outlaws coerced marriages. Many women, however, still
 adhere to traditional norms, due to social, cultural, and
 religious pressures.
 Some corruption occurs, but is risky in Iraq where the
 penalty has at times been execution. There is no indica-
 tion that existing corruption interferes with vital needs
 or denies important resources to the average citizen or
 to the poor.
