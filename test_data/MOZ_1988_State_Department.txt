 MOZAMBIQUE
 Mozambique is a one-party state led by President Joaquim
 Alberto Chissano. The Front for the Liberation of Mozambique
 (FRELIMO), the only party allowed, is the key decisionmaking
 organ. Under Mozambique's Constitution, President Chissano is
 also Commander-In-Chief of the Armed Forces and is empowered
 to appoint most government officials. The Council of
 Ministers, headed by Prime Minister Mario Machungo, is
 responsible for the day-to-day operations of the Government.
 The 249-member national legislature, the People's Assembly,
 has limited influence: it meets for 1-week sessions twice a
 year to debate and approve legislation proposed by the
 Government.  A self-pxoclaimed Marxist-Leninist party at its
 inception, FRELIMO in'recent years has pursued pragmatic
 domestic policies, and in foreign policy has gradually moved
 towards a more genuinely nonaligned position. President
 Chissano has concentrated on dealing with the economic and
 political realities of catastrophic drought and civil
 conflict, which together have destroyed much of the economic
 and social infrastructure and.caused widespread civilian
 dislocations and casualties.
 The security forces include the Armed Forces of Mozambique
 (FPLM), numbering about 60,000 soldiers, a People's Militia,
 and the Mozambican National Security Service (SNASP). Since
 the late 1970's the Mozambican National Resistance (RENAMO)
 has waged a guerrilla war against the Government, resulting in
 the death of tens of thousands of civilians. RENAMO's
 strength is estimated at between 12,000 to 22(000 armed men;
 it is active in all of Mozambique's 10 provinces.
 RENAMO, originally-the creation of the Rhodesian intelligence
 service, has historically received support from the South
 African Government. 'In September President Chissano met with
 South African President Botha in an.:effort to revive the 1984
 Nkomati Accord, which committed their countries to cease
 hostile acts against one another and to increase economic
 cooperation. In 1988 the Government received the predominant
 share of its military assistance from the Soviet Union and its
 allies. However, the United Kingdom, Spain, and Zambia also
 provided military training and assistance, and other Western
 donors provided nonlethal assistance. Zimbabwe maintained-
 from 5,000 to 8,000 troops in Mozambique in order to protect
 the Beira Corridor and other vital areas. In addition,
 Tanzania had between 500 and 2,500 troops in Zambezia
 province, which were withdrawn-by the end of November, and
 Malawi had 600 to 1,000 soldiers along the Nacala railway line.
 The Government's economic reform program progressed on
 schedule in 198a. As part of World Bank and International
 Monetary Fund programs, the Government implemented further
 currency devaluations and other measures to deregulate the
 economy. The vast majority of Mozambicans are engaged in
 subsistence farming. However, due to drought and the civil
 conflict, over 1 million persons have been displaced within
 the country, and, in addition, an estimated 1 million
 Mozambicans have sought refuge in neighboring countries.
 Altogether, close to 6 million persons, out of a total
 population of 14 million, are affected by the ongoing
 emergency. International donors pledged nearly $250 million
 in emergency aid at a conference in Maputo in April.
 In 1988 human rights in Mozambique, e.g., freedoms of speech,
 press, and assembly, continued to be tightly circumscribed by
 
 
 228
 MOZAMBIQUE
 the one-party structure, and there remained serious human
 rights problems due to the civil conflict, now in its 12th
 year. Thousands of Mozambicans have been killed in the
 continuing civil conflict, with some estimates as high as
 100,000 killed by RENAMO alone. Civilians reported many
 abuses by RENAMO; there were also some reports of abuses by
 Mozambican forces. A credible 1987-1988 study (cited as
 "Report on Mozambican Refugees") by an independent consultant,
 Robert Gersony, based on interviews with 200 displaced persons
 within Mozambique and with refugees in neighboring countries,
 documented a pattern of atrocities by RENAMO against
 civilians, including summary executions, mass kidnapings,
 forced labor, rapes, robbery, mass murders, mutilations, and
 torture. Against this tragic background, the Government took
 some important conciliatory steps to improve human rights in
 1988. It ordered the return of expropriated church property
 and also reaffirmed its commitment to religious freedom during
 a Papal visit in September. It granted full amnesty to almost
 3,000 RENAMO guerrillas according to government figures, gave
 pardons to hundreds of people detained under security laws,
 and tightened military discipline and revamped the military
 justice system. It permitted the International Committee of
 the Red Cross (ICRC) to begin a program of prison visits and
 to commence food relief flights into areas of conflict.
 Within the one-party system, there ias a trend toward more
 open discussion and broader participation.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 Both government forces and RENAMO have been responsible for
 the deaths of civilians in the course of the conflict between
 them. There were no estimates of killings in 1988 by
 government forces, but there have been credible reports,
 including allegations by refugees, of abuses by FRELIMO
 forces. However, it appears that these abuses are
 attributable to undisciplined forces and do not reflect a
 systematic policy.
 Atrocities by RENAMO against defenseless civilians have been
 well documented from a number of governmental and
 nongovernmental sources, including missionaries, international
 organizations, and emergency relief workers. The "Report on
 Mozambican Refugees" conservatively estimated that 100,000
 civilians had been murdered by RENAMO alone during the
 conflict. While there were no massacres in 1988 as dramatic
 as that at Homoine in 1987, where 424 persons were killed,
 there were confirmed reports of defenseless civilians
 deliberately killed by RENAMO in attacks throughout the
 country (as, for example at Guija in Gaza province in January,
 at Xai-Xai in Gaza province in August, and near Manica in
 Maputo province in August).
 The former Secretary General of RENAMO, Evo Fernandes, was
 murdered in Lisbon, apparently for political reasons;
 however, both RENAMO and the Government denied involvement in
 the Fernandes murder. There were no additional reports of
 politically motivated killings in 1988 not attributable to the
 conflict. There were no reports of public executions.
 
 
 229
 MOZAMBIQUE
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reports of government-perpetrated disappearances
 in 1988. However, security forces, principally SNASP, acting
 under security legislation, often held detainees incommunicado
 for extended periods, and relatives and friends have no way of
 knowing what has happened to the missing. In an important
 step, the Government authorized prison visits by the ICRC in
 1988. When fully implemented, the ICRC program may provide
 security detainees and prisoners with a system for
 communicating with their families. Amnesty International
 stated that, despite repeated requests, the Government has not
 provided information about the fate of a number of prisoners
 sent to reeducation camps in the mid-1970s.
 The "Report on Mozambican Refugees" documented a pattern of
 kidnaping defenseless peasants by RENAMO. Some of the victims
 were released after being required to transport stolen
 materials for long distances or to perform other tasks.
 Others were held indefinitely in rural areas outside of formal
 government control and were sometimes forced to undergo
 military training. The majority of amnestied RENAMO
 guerrillas claim they had been kidnaped, forced to take
 military training, and subsequently to fight for RENAMO.
 RENAMO also continued kidnaping and holding foreigners in
 1988. Seven crew members of a West German freighter were
 kidnaped by RENAMO in August; four of these were subsequently
 released. A Portuguese nun was released by RENAMO in May
 after months of captivity in RENAMO camps. A recently
 released British national, Nicholas'de la Casa, had been held
 captive by RENAMO for over a year. He reported that he had
 been well treated but kept under close guard.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Both government and RENAMO forces have been accused of
 torturing prisohers and civilians. In 1988 the Minister of
 Interior and the political commissar of the armed' forces
 separately toured the country and openly criticized abuses
 against civilians by soldiers, police, and the militia. In
 1988 the media reported on the trials of police, troops,
 militih, and government officials charged with corruption or
 the abuse of civilians. The President and other senior
 officials have repeatedly and publicly emphasized the need for
 security forces to respect the population. A major step
 forward in imposing greater discipline was taken with the
 approval of new laws on military crimes and a military justice
 system (see Section l.e. below).
 RENAMO has tortured, maimed, and mistreated both military
 prisoners and civilians. Numerous eyewitnesses have confirmed
 that RENAMO mutilates civilians believed to sympathize with
 the Government by cutting off noses, ears, breasts, and lips.
 Thousands of Mozambicans, including children, are reported to
 have undergone such disfigurement. In some instances,
 villagers have been compelled to watch as civilians who had
 attempted to escape or refused to obey RENAMO orders were
 slowly hacked to death with machetes or burned alive in their
 homes. The extent of such atrocities was revealed by the
 "Report on Mozambican Refugees." Numerous refugees and
 Mozambican inhabitants were maimed by mines planted by RENAMO
 in civilian areas. Some have been injured bymines planted by
 FRELIMO forces in border areas.
 
 
 20
 MOZAMBIQUE
 In 1988 the practice of imposing sentences of public floggings
 continued, but the frequency and extent of such sentences were
 markedly reduced from past years.  In one case the Government
 prosecuted and convicted the head of a neighborhood
 association when a man died from an illegal flogging.
 Political prisoners were reportedly brutally tortured and
 often killed at reeducation camps, run by SNASP, during the
 early postindependence years. The Government has claimed that
 all except one of these reeducation camps have been closed.
 The Ministry of Interior, which is responsible for the police
 force, admits to maintaining six detention centers which are
 formally designated reeducation centers. Reportedly, these
 centers are separate from reeducation camps for political
 prisoners established after independence, and house about 800
 prisoners convicted of common crimes. Many of these camps are
 reportedly open prisons where inmates farm and live with their
 families. A model prison for captured RENAMO guerrillas at
 Inhambane provides training to help inmates reintegrate into
 society. There is almost no information about the treatment
 of RENAMO prisoners or other persons detained under security
 legislation at other detention sites, but the ICRC has visited
 political prisoners.
 Prison conditions in most Mozambique prisons, however, are
 poor, marked by problems with hygiene, food, and medical care
 similar to those which affect many segments of the
 population. A Nigerian businessman, who escaped from prison
 in Maputo and fled the country, alleged that prison officials
 beat and tortured inmates and operated a prostitution ring
 with female prisoners. The allegations were vigorously denied
 by the Government.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Mozambique has three separate legal systems: The regular
 civil/criminal system is composed of the judiciary (courts)
 and a police force under the authority of the Ministry of
 Interior; the military-run state security system, which
 includes the Ministry of National Security (SNASP), has
 jurisdiction over both political and economic (sabotage)
 crimes against the State; the recently established military
 justice system has jurisdiction over most crimes committed by
 military personnel and crimes by civilians which adversely
 affect the military.
 Under the regular civil/criminal court system, persons accused
 of the most serious crimes can be detained up to 84 days
 without investigation. With court approval, such detainees
 can then be held for two additional periods of 84 days while
 the police complete their investigation. While detained,
 persons have the right to counsel and to contact relatives and
 friends. In some cases, detainees may be released from prison
 while the investigation proceeds, but the bail system in
 Mozambique remains ill defined. The law stipulates that if
 the prescribed period for investigation has been completed and
 no charges have been brought, the detainee must be released.
 In practice these procedures are not always followed, and
 legal counsel is frequently not available. In 1988 Members of
 the People's Assembly criticized cases of lengthy detention
 without trial.
 Under the state security system, all investigations and
 arrests are carried out by SNASP. Detainees may be held
 indefinitely, often incommunicado, without formal charges.
 
 
 231
 MOZAMBIQUE
 They do not have the right to challenge the legality of their
 detention. SNASP has the power to conduct pretrial inquiries
 without reference to a judge. In 1988 the Government
 authorized the ICRC to visit inmates jailed under security
 legislation at 10 places of detention throughout the country,
 in accordance with standard ICRC criteria. ICRC.reported that
 it visited 658 inmates at Machava prison in Maputo province
 and prisons in Sofala, Gaza, and Inhambane provinces. RENAMO
 has not agreed to allow the ICRC to visit detainees.
 At the end of 1988, the number of political detainees and
 prisoners held in SNASP prisons was estimated at around
 1,000. Presumably many of these are captured RENAMO
 prisoners. The Government claimed that all foreigners and
 one-third of the Mozambicans imprisoned under security
 legislation were pardoned in 1988.
 During 1988 there were no reports of anyone being exiled from
 Mozambique. The Government publicly rejects power-sharing
 negotiations with RENAMO, but at the end of 1987 it proclaimed
 a 12-month amnesty for RENAMO personnel.  Seminars were held
 throughout the country to explain amnesty law procidures to
 provincial authorities. In December the amnesty was extended,
 and the President stated that the GPRM welcomed efforts by
 persons of good will who were in contabt with RENAMO elements
 with the objective of persuading them to reenter Mozambican
 society under the amnesty. RENAMO guerrillas were given the
 option of turning themselves in to the armed forces, the
 Mozambican Red Cross, local authorities at Mozambican
 embassies, or to their families. The Government claimed that
 during 1988 almost 3,000 RENAMO guerrillas surrendered in
 order to benefit from the amnesty. President Chissano
 specifically stated that Mozambique's amnesty law was
 applicable to everyone, including RENAMO chief Alfonso
 Dhlakama. In a highly publicized case, former spokesman for
 RENAMO Paul Oliveiro returned to Maputo and surrendered under
 the amnesty law. Numerous public ceremonies to reintegrate
 former guerrillas officially into society were held throughout
 the country and publicized by the media. There have been few
 reports of mistreatment of amnestied guerrillas.
 With regard to forced or compulsory labor, see Section 6.c.
 e.   Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The modern judicial system is based on Portuguese civil law.
 There is a series of people's courts at the district and
 provincial levels, and a Superior Court of Appeals in Maputo.
 A Supreme Court was constituted at the end of the year with
 the naming of judges. Once the Court begins operations, the
 Revolutionary Military Tribunal and the Superior Court of
 Appeals will cease to exist. Persons accused under the Law of
 Crimes Against the Security of the People and the State (i.e.,
 the majority of political prisoners) will then be tried by the
 provincial courts under normal judicial procedures. The
 Supreme Court will automatically hear all appeals of death
 sentences. An attorney general and a deputy attorney general
 were also appointed. These steps completed the establishment
 of Mozambique's judicial system as envisaged in the 1976
 judiciary organization law. Nonpolitical trials conducted by
 the regular civil and criminal court system are generally fair
 and held in public. However, a large backlog of pending cases
 has resulted in long waiting periods before prisoners are
 brought to trial.
 
 
 232
 MOZAMBIQUE
 At the local level, there are also customary courts. Trials
 are often conducted in a public place in the village where the
 crime was allegedly committed in order to encourage public
 attendance and participation. The proceedings are conducted
 by a trained representative of the Ministry of Justice,
 assisted by two or four popularly elected "judges." Since the
 legal knowledge of those involved is limited, they are
 instructed to exercise common sense and to apply locally
 accepted principles. Customary courts handle only minor
 offenses.
 More serious crimes are tried in the people's courts at the
 district and provincial levels. These courts are open to the
 public, but in certain cases, such as those involving rape,
 the defendant can request a closed trial. Persons convicted
 of a serious crime have the automatic right of appeal to the
 next higher court.
 Persons charged with crimes against the State are tried by the
 Revolutionary Military Tribunal. These trials are normally
 held in camera without benefit of most due process rights.
 However, in 1988 the Tribunal accorded due process rights
 during the trial of an Australian missionary who admitted that
 he had delivered equipment to RENAMO. The Tribunal dismissed
 on technicalities charges which carried mandatory death
 sentences and imposed minimum sentences on other charges.
 According to reports, the Government brought only a small
 number of SNASP detainees before the Tribunal in 1988.
 The Government proceeded in 1988 with the reorganization of
 the military justice system, and the Military Crimes and
 Military Tribunal Law took effect in July. This Law
 establishes a nationwide system of brigade courts and
 provincial military courts and specifies military-related
 crimes. The text of the Military Tribunal Law was published
 in a series of articles in the daily newspaper, and the media
 gave extensive coverage to installation ceremonies for
 recently appointed military judges.
 The Government is making efforts to improve the administration
 of justice, including taking steps to increase the number of
 trained judicial personnel. In 1988 it established the
 National Institute of Judicial Assistance (INAJ) which, inter
 alia, now provides a system of public defenders. INAJ also
 provides legal training that qualifies persons to join the
 Institute and handle cases before Mozambican courts. The
 number of fully trained lawyers in Mozambique increased from
 about 12 immediately after independence to nearly 80 in 1988.
 The national law school was reopened in 1988 and plans to
 graduate 70 lawyers per year within 5 years. Government
 lawyers are allowed to engage in part-time private practice,
 and a small but growing number of private lawyers have
 full-time practices.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 In areas of active insurgency, homes are entered at will by
 security or police forces. It is widely assumed that
 surveillance devices are employed to monitor local and
 international telecommunications systems and that mail is
 periodically inspected. The Government and party do not
 generally interfere with family affairs such as marriage or
 the rearing of children.
 
 
 233
 MOZAMBIQUE
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:,
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Freedoms of speech and press are circumscribed. While
 President Chissano has encouraged citizens to voice their
 concerns, the average Mozambican remains reluctant publicly to
 criticize government policies or to report abuses by
 officials. Reportedly, there has been more open debate at
 closed party and government meetings. In 1988 President
 Chissano completed visits to each of the provinces, where he
 held large public meetings and listened to popular grievances.
 The Government exerts control, either directly or indirectly,
 over all authorized media in the country, ranging from the
 radio and television facilities to the daily Noticias
 newspaper. The Mozambican media promote government and party
 positions, but also include controlled reporting on abuses
 within the system and flaws in the implementation of
 government policies. For example, the weekly magazine Tempo
 regularly features substantive articles and editorials on
 sensitive issues, including housing, salaries, price
 increases, implementation of educational policies, and racial
 discrimination within Mozambican society. Some foreign
 publications, including independent Western newsmagazines, are
 sometimes available in bookstores. Church groups circulate
 newsletters and pastoral letters. Western journalists
 (including Americans) are welcome in Mozambique, and the
 Government generally assists in their visits. Regular foreign
 radio broadcasts and South African television are received
 without interference, and there is no restriction on listening
 to them.
 Academic freedom is restricted. Professors and teachers are
 expected to promote FRELIMO positions in the classroom.
 Nonetheless, there is a fairly free exchange of ideas and
 discussion of issues at the college level.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Political opposition to the Government is not permitted.
 Public meetings other than purely social or recreational
 gatherings are controlled by the iocal authorities'. There are
 "mass movements" for groups such as women, youth, and workers
 affiliated with the party. There are several professional
 groups, such as the Mozambican Writers' Association, which are
 also affiliated with the party. Although membership in these
 organizations is voluntary, the party occasionally exerts
 pressure on citizens to join. In 1988 an independent
 association of private businessmen was chartered. Shortly
 after it was organized, the associatioh was invited by the
 Government to represent private employers at the annual
 International Labor Organization (ILO) conference. There is
 also an active Chamber of Commerce.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Although the Constitution provides for freedom of religion,
 and separation of church and state, the Government officially
 has been critical of religious activities and beliefs.
 However, in recent years the Government has permitted churches
 actively to pursue their ministries without interference, and
 church membership has increased steadily. In 1988 the
 Government accelerated its policy of dialog with religious
 leaders, especially with the Catholic church, to resolve
 
 
 234
 MOZAMBIQUE
 problems created by past policies which had restricted church
 activities and expropriated church properties. The Government
 publicly ordered the return of all expropriated places of
 worship, and negotiations were under way at the end of 1988
 for the return of other church properties, such as religious
 residences and seminaries. The Government fully cooperated in
 organizing the visit of Pope John Paul II to Mozambique in
 September.
 In 1988 the government-controlled media gave coverage to many
 religious ceremonies, including a procession through the
 streets of Maputo, commemorating holy days. In Maputo,
 religious book stores openly sell Bibles and other
 literature. The Government provides some funds for
 developtent projects administered by the Christian Council of
 Mozambique. The Ministry of Justice's Religious Affairs
 Department serves as the official liaison with churches and
 intervenes on behalf of churches with other government
 agencies. There is an active Bible society which has
 functioned unimpeded since independence. The Muslim community
 has two established national organizations, representing
 Shi'ite and Sunni Muslims, and sent groups on pilgrimages to
 Mecca, partially funded by the Government. Although the
 Government still reserves the right to decide whether
 individual clergy can visit outlying areas, there were no
 reports of cases in which travel was denied.
 Party members are not prohibited from membership in a church
 or mosque. While it does not encourage religious practice,
 the party has stated that persons with religious affiliations
 will be considered for party membership on a case by case
 basis.
 Church properties and personnel near RENAMO targets were
 particularly hard hit during 1988. A Methodist mission in
 Inhambane province, which had been rebuilt after a previous
 attack in 1987, was damaged again by RENAMO this year.
 Several Presbyterian congregations in southern Mozambique were
 disbanded after RENAMO attacks on churches and traveling
 preachers. Two Catholic nuns were wounded when a vehicle
 transporting patients was attacked by RENAMO.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Travel and relocation within the country are controlled by
 security and employment requirements. Ambushes by RENAMO make
 road travel hazardous throughout the country. Mozambicans
 planning to travel outside their district must obtain a travel
 permit from local government authorities. In practice, this
 system is not always enforced. Travel regulations were eased
 somewhat in 1988 for international travelers by elimination of
 a requirement that employers send letters requesting exit
 permits.
 Mozambican law does not address the issue of emigration, but
 in practice Mozambicans can emigrate if they wish. A 1982 law
 allowed for the reacquisition of citizenship by Mozambicans
 who left the country and assumed another nationality. In 1987
 the People's Assembly enacted a nationality law restoring
 Mozambican citizenship to women who lost it through marriage
 to foreigners.
 In recent years, over 1 million persons have been dislocated
 within Mozambique, mainly to Maputo and other urban areas. In
 
 
 235
 MOZAMBIQUE
 late April, the ICRC began to distribute relief supplies in
 areas of conflict, initially in Sofala province, with the
 authorization of the Government. RENAMO publicly alleged that
 government forces bombed and attacked sites under its
 occupation that had been designated by the ICRC for
 distribution of emergency relief supplies in Manica and
 Zambezia provinces. The Government stressed, however, that
 the ICRC had not been authorized to operate in those areas.
 In July the Government suspended ICRC relief operations,
 reportedly due to government military offensives, and these
 operations had not resumed at the end of the year.
 In addition, over 1 million persons have fled across borders
 to neighboring countries as refugees mainly due to the
 intensification of the conflict. Most of those fleeing the
 country went to bordering states: Malawi (600,000); Zimbabwe
 (75,000); Swaziland (40,000); Tanzania (70,000); Zambia
 (30,000); and South Africa (200,000). In 1988 few of these
 persons returned voluntarily. There were major incidents of
 forced repatriation of Mozambican refugees--at least 8,000
 persons--by Zimbabwean authorities during 1988. The South
 African Government also regularly deported 40 to 50 Mozambican
 refugees and illegal workers per day at Ressano Garcia.
 The Government cooperates with the United Nations High
 Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in both receiving returning
 Mozambicans and in protecting refugees from other countries
 The Government has publicly and privately made clear its
 opposition to forced repatriation. Since independence, the
 Government has readily provided asylum to refugees from
 neighboring countries. However, because of the difficult
 conditions within Mozambique, there are only about 500
 refugees in the country. Most refugees in Mozambique are from
 South Africa and Chile. Since signing the Nkomati Accord in
 1984, the Government has restricted entry of members and
 supporters of the African National Congress.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Citizens are not free to change their government, and no
 organized political opposition is allowed. The FRELIMO party
 is headed by an 11-member Political Bureau which is elected by
 the 118-member Central Committee. Party congresses are
 convened every 5 years to elect Central Committee members.
 FRELIMO and the Government are controlled by a small cadre of
 senior party officers. At the fourth party congress in 1983,
 party membership was 110,000, or about 2 percent of the
 population. However, there is some scope for political
 participation for those who are not party members. Several
 government ministers, at least 15 deputies in the National
 People's Assembly, and some members of provincial and regional
 people's assemblies are not members of the party.
 The national legislature, the People's Assembly, serves to
 ratify legislation prepared by the Government or party. In
 recent years, Assembly debates have been spirited and have had
 some impact in delaying proposed legislation. The first
 national elections since 1977 for the people's assemblies at
 the local, district, provincial, and national levels were held
 in late 1986 and early 1987. The party drew up single slates
 of candidates for the elections, and party structures reviewed
 these slates with the local population prior to the election.
 Voters had some degree of choice since there were, by law, 20
 
 
 236
 MOZAMBIQUE
 percent more candidates than seats available in the various
 assemblies.
 The Constitution is currently being revised in a process that
 requires public debate and study throughout the country. A
 proposed change provides for indirect election of the
 President for a 5-year term by the provincial and national
 people's assemblies.
 Women are increasingly prominent in government positions. In
 1988 two women were appointed to national directorships in the
 Ministry of Justice. In the 1986-87 elections, 39 women (15.6
 percent) were elected to the National People's Assembly.
 About a fourth of the members of provincial and district
 people's assemblies are women.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government's cooperation with international human rights
 organizations improved substantially during 1988. President
 Chissano received ICRC President Sammurega in February.
 Subsequently" the Government authorized ICRC prison visits at
 a number of places of detention in accordance with standard
 ICRC criteria (see also Section l.d.). The Government also
 held meetings with Amnesty International during 1988, notably
 in October when Secretary General Ian Martin visited
 Mozambique. The Government agreed in principle to a United
 Nations investigation of the human rights situation in
 Mozambique. There are no groups within Mozambique that
 monitor human rights. The People's Assembly ratified in 1988
 the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Despite intertribal strains imposed by the conflict and
 economic collapse, Mozambican society remains markedly
 multiracial. However, the majority of the FRELIMO leadership
 are members of the southern-based Shangaan ethnic group, and
 RENAMO has sought to obtain support by exploiting historically
 based intertribal antipathies, especially in the central and
 northern part of the country. As a result of the greater
 educational opportunities which were available to ethnic
 Asians and whites prior to independence, they hold important
 positions in numbers much greater than their proportion of the
 general population. While the Government is still
 multiracial, in recent years there has been a trend towards
 "Mozambicanization" of the Government, with some whites and
 ethnic Asians replaced by qualified blacks.
 In a largely rural society, the reality is that the vast
 majority of women are still bound to traditional roles, such
 as childbearing and tilling the fields. However, women have,
 in theory, equal rights under Mozambique's Constitution, and
 the Government is continuing efforts to improve the legal
 status of women. For example, the nationality laws of 1987
 gave women equal rights in this important area, by allowing
 women who marry foreigners, and their children, to retain
 Mozambican nationality. The Organization of Mozambican Women,
 the party's mass organization for assisting women, is

 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Workers have the right to join unions, but all trade unions in
 Mozambique must be affiliates of the Organization of
 Mozambican Workers (OTM), the country's only authorized trade
 union central. The OTM was established in 1983 as a mass
 organization of the sole political party, FRELIMO. Thirteen
 national unions have formally organized and joined the OTM.
 The OTM's membership of about 300,000 constitutes over half of
 the salaried workers in Mozambique. The OTM plans to organize
 another three national unions to complete the country's trade
 union network. The OTM is governed by a six-member
 secretariat which is elected every 5 years at plenary union
 congresses. The current leadership was elected at the first
 OTM congress in 1984.
 The OTM is prohibited by law from striking or taking other job
 actions to advance the interests of its members.
 The OTM participates in the meetings of the ILO, but it is not
 affiliated with any non-African international trade union
 organizations. It is a member of the Organization of African
 Trade Union Unity and the South African Trade Union
 Coordinating Council. In 1988 it sent a delegate to the
 International Confederation of Free Trade Union's world
 congress. The OTM has extensive ties with Soviet bloc trade
 unions, but it also has programs with a number of unions in
 Western Europe. A delegation from the American Federation of
 labor-Congress of Industrial Organizations visited Maputo in
 October. The OTM has a sizable nutber of assistance programs
 with foreign trade unions for training and development
 projects.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 Workers are only allowed to organize and bargain collectively
 within the OTM structure. Union membership is voluntary, but
 the Government encourages workers to join and actively
 participate in unions. The Government sets wage rates, and
 collective bargaining as such does not take place. However,
 the OTM is consulted by the Government on labor and economic
 policies which affect unions, and the OTM monitors
 occupational safety conditions. One of the OTM's primary
 activities is to represent workers at disciplinary action
 hearings and during labor disputes. Under Mozambican law, the
 OTM must be consulted before a worker is dismissed from his
 position. The OTM sponsors a number of training programs for
 workers and operates a canteen service to provide low-cost
 meals at work sites and factories.
 Until recently labor law in Mozambique placed extensive
 restrictions on employers' control over their employees.
 However, the Government has enacted a comprehensive labor law
 that increases the autonomy of employers. Among other things,
 it allows both public and private firms to fire employees
 without obtaining governmental permission. Companies may now
 also reward their best workers with bonuses and penalize less
 productive employees. During 1988 professional associations
 were given the right to petition the People's Assembly for
 improvements in professional salaries and working conditions.
 Journalists won a substantial wage increase through this means.
 Labor legislation is applied uniformly throughout the country
 in the wage economy. There are no export processing zones.

 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Forced or compulsory labor is prohibited by law, and there
 have been no reports of such labor in practice by the
 Government. RENAMO guerrillas regularly kidnap civilians and
 force them to work in a variety of support functions,
 including growing food.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 Child labor is controlled, and in the wage economy the minimum
 working age (excluding agriculture) is 16.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 Most of the population is engaged in subsistence agriculture
 and is not affected by the wage economy and government
 regulations concerning working conditions. In the small
 modern sector, the Government has enacted health and
 environmental laws to protect workers. On occasion, the
 Government has closed down firms for noncompliance with these
 laws, but enforcement is difficult in the current economic
 situation. Legislation containing job-related safeguards for
 pregnant women and new mothers provides for the right to 60
 days' maternity leave. If firms have day-care facilities,
 women reportedly have the right to 2 half-hour breaks daily
 for a year to feed their children.
 Under the economic reform program, the Government increased
 wages substantially after imposing drastic currency
 devaluations. Wages are still woefully inadequate for workers
 to maintain a decent standard of living, given persistent
 inflation and price increases linked to the economic reform
 program. The minimum wage for skilled workers is equivalent
 to $27 per month, $25 per month for other nunagricultural
 workers, and about $20 per month for agricultural workers.
 The minimum wage law is widely violated in the private sector,
 and actual wages are sometimes well below the legal minimum.
 The standard workweek is 44 hours.
