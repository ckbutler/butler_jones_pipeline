 ST. KITTS & NEVIS
 St. Kitts and Nevis is a small two-island state with a
 parliamentary d(mbcracy modeled after that of the United
 Kingdom. The Constitution provides the smaller island of
 Nevis considerable self-government, as well as the right to
 secede from the federation if certain enumerated procedures
 are followed. The country is governed by a prime minister, a
 cabinet, and a legislative assembly. The Governor General,
 with largely ceremonial duties, is the titular Head of State.
 The Constitution.requires general elections at least every 5
 years. Prime Minister Kennedy Simmonds and his People's
 Action Movement came to power in a coalition Government in
 1980 and were returned to power after general elections in
 1984 and 1989.
 Security forces consist of a small police force, which
 includes a Special Service Unit that receives some light
 infantry training, and a small coast guard.
 St. Kitts and Nevis has a mixed economy based on sugar cane
 and tourism. Most commercial enterprises are privately owned,
 but the sugar industry (the country's largest) and 85 percent
 of all arable land are owned by a state gorporation. The
 approximate 1988 per capita gross domestic product was
 $2,534. Steady economic growth continued in 1989.
 St. Kitts and Nevis maintained its good human rights record
 during 1989.

 With regard to forced or compulsory labor, see Section 6.c.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial

 receive a fair, speedy, and public trial, and these
 requirements are generally adhered.to. The judiciary, a part
 
 
 725
 ST. KITTS & NEVIS
 of the Eastern Caribbean legal system, is highly regarded and
 independent. Final appeal may be made to the Queen's Privy
 Council in the United Kingdom. There are no military or
 political courts. Legal assistance is available to indigent
 defendants.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Neither the Government nor the police interfere arbitrarily in
 the private lives of individuals. Warrants are required to
 search private homes.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution provides for freedom of speech and of the
 press. The Government owns the only radio and television
 station on St. Kitts. There is a religious television station
 and a privately owned radio station on Nevis. The
 government-owned radio and television generally do not
 adequately publicize rallies and conventions held by the
 opposition political party.
 St. Kitts and Nevis does not have a daily newspaper, although
 each of the major political parties publishes a weekly or
 biweekly newspaper. The papers are free to criticize the
 Government and do so regularly and vigorously. International
 news publications are readily available.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Constitution provides for the right of peaceful assembly.
 Organized demonstrations, rallies, and public meetings
 sponsored by political parties occur regularly. Usually these
 take place without government interference.
 For a discussion of freedom of association as it applies to
 labor unions, see Section 6.a.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 The Constitution provides for the free exercise of religion,
 and religious practices are not restricted. Most church
 members belong to Protestant denominations. All groups are
 free to maintain links with coreligionists in other countries.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Travel inside and outside of the country is unrestricted.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Citizens are able to change their government by peaceful
 means. A vigorous multiparty political system exists in which
 political parties are free to conduct their activities.
 Periodic elections are held in which all citizens 18 years of
 age and older may register and vote by secret ballot.
 The People's Action Movement (PAM) of Prime Minister Kennedy
 Simmonds holds a majority of seats in the Parliament. PAM has
 worked closely with the Nevis Reformation Party of Nevis
 
 
 726
 ST. KITTS & NEVIS
 Premier Simeon Daniel. In the March 1989 national election,
 the two parties won 8 of 11 elected seats in Parliament. The
 former head of the main opposition St. Kitts Labour Party, Lee
 Moore, charged before the elections that PAM had used
 fraudulent ballots to help insure its 1984 victory and was
 prepared to employ fraud to maintain its majority in the 1989
 elections, but he presented no credible evidence to indicate
 that the elections were not conducted in any other than a free
 and fair manner.
 Section 4 Goverinmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 No international human rights organization maintains an office
 in St. Kitts and Nevis. The Government is firm in its respect
 for human rights.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 There were no reports of'systematic discrimination based on
 race, sex, creed, language, or social status. The role of
 women in society is not restricted by law. However, the role
 of most women in the country is still circumscribed by culture
 and tradition. The Government created the Ministry of Women's
 Affairs to help redefine the role of women in society and to
 ensure that women's rights are promoted. According to a
 Ministry'official, violence against women is a problem in St.
 Kitts-Nevis, but gauging the extent of the problem is
 difficult because many women are reluctant to file a complaint
 or pursue thier complaints in the courts. Despite this
 reluctance, there were publicly reported cases of both
 domestic violence and rape in 1989, and a number of
 convictions. According to the Women's Affairs Ministry, the
 police stand ready to investigate allegations of violence
 (both domestic violence and rape) but may be cautious about
 going to court, because many women eventually withdraw their
 complaints. If the woman pursues the complaint, enforcement
 by police and courts is effective. Penalties range from fines
 to long-term imprisonment, depending on the gravity of the
 offense.
 The Women's Affairs Ministry sent a ministry official to the
 United States in 1989 for training in counseling abused
 women. A policewoman was also sent to the United States for
 the same training, and now heads a special unit dedicated to
 abused women. The Ministry also sponsored a workshop on child
 abuse with an expert on domestic violence, which was attended
 by police, clergy, teachers, community workers, and guidance
 counselors. Ministry officals met regularly with police to
 increase awareness of the problem of violence against women,
 and also ran a 3-day radio program on the problem of domestic
 violence.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 The Constitution provides for the right to form and belong to
 trade unions. The major labor union, the St. Kitts Trades and
 Labour Union, is affiliated with the opposition St. Kitts
 Labour Party and is organized in all sectors of the economy.
 Membership appears to be declining, as the Government assumes
 some of the social welfare roles formerly played by unions.
 
 
 727
 ST. KITTS & NEVIS
 There is also an independent teachers' union and a union
 representing dockworkers in the capital city.
 The right to strike, while not specified by law, is well
 established and respected in practice. There were no major
 strikes in 1989, although workers on a public highway project
 held a brief work stoppage to obtain a holiday pay concession,
 which was granted. Unions are free to affiliate with
 federations, confederations, and international bodies,
 although St. Kitts is not a member of the International Labor
 Organization.
 b. The Right To Organize and Bargain Collectively
 Labor unions are free to organize and to negotiate for better
 wages and benefits for union members. There are no areas
 where union organization or collective bargaining are
 discouraged or impeded. There is no legislation governing
 organization and representation of workers, and employers are
 not legally bound to recognize a union, but past practice has
 been for employers to do so if a majority of workers polled
 wish to organize. The Labor Commission attempts to mediate in
 disputes between labor and management on an ad hoc basis.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 The Constitution forbids slavery and forced labor, which do
 not exist in practice.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 The minimum legal working age is 14. The Labor Ministry
 relies heavily on school truant officers and the Community
 Affairs Division to monitor compliance, which they do
 effectively.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 The workweek is 40 hours in 5 days. Workers are guaranteed a
 minimum vacation of 2 weeks. Minimum wages for domestic
 servants and retail store employees were established by law in
 1984 and updated in 1989. These range from about $24 per week
 for a shop clerk to $36 per week for a maid and $60 for a shop
 supervisor. The minimum wage would provide an adequate,
 though Spartan, living for the wage earner and family. Wages
 may be supplemented by the widespread practice of keeping
 small animals (goats, chickens). Most people live in extended
 families where there may be more than one wage earner. The
 Labor Commission undertakes regular wage inspections and
 special investigations when complaints are received; employers
 found in violation are required to pay back wages. While
 there are no specific health and safety regulations, the
 factories law provides general health and safety guidance to
 labor ministry inspectors.
