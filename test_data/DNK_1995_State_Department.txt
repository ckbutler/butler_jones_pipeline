 DENMARK
 Denmark is a constitutional monarchy with parliamentary democratic rule. Queen
 Margrethe II is Head of State. The Cabinet, accountable to the unicameral Par-
 liament (Folketing), leads the Government. A minority three-party coalition took of-
 fice in September 1994 following national elections.
 The national police have sole responsibility for internal security. The civilian au-
 thorities maintain effective control of the security forces.
 Denmark has an advanced, market-based industrial economy. One-half of the
 workforce is employed in the public sector. The key industries are food processing
 and metal working;, the leading exports are a broad range of industrial goods. The
 economy provides residents with a high standard of living.
 The Government fully respected the human rights of its citizens, and the law and
 judiciary provide effective means of dealing with instances of individual abuse. The
 Government responded to a 1994 Amnesty International report by suspending the
 use by police of leg-locks as a method of restraining detainees.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political or
 other extrajudicial killings.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punzshment.-
 The law prohibits such practices, and there were no reports that officials employed
 them. The Government responded to a 1994 Amnesty International report by sus-
 pending the use by police of leg-locks as a method of restraining detainees.
 Prison conditions meet minimum international standards, and the Government
 permits visits by human rights monitors.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The law prohibits arbitrary arrest, deten-
 tion, or exile, and the Government observes this prohibition.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The law provides for an independent judiciary,
 and the Government respects this provision in practice. The judiciary provides citi-
 zens with a fair and efficient judicial process.
 The judicial system consists of a series of local and regional courts, with the Su-
 preme Court at the apex.
 The law provides for the right to a fair trial and an independent judiciary vigor-
 ously enforces this right.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f, Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family Home, or Correspondence.-The law
 prohibits such practices, government authorities generally respect these prohibi-
 tions, and violations are subject to effective legal sanction.

 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The law provides for freedom of the press, and
 the Government respects this right in practice. An independent press, an effective
 judiciary, and a democratic political system combine to ensure freedom of speech
 and of the press, including academic freedom.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The law provides for these
 rights and the Government respects them in practice.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for religious freedom and the
 Government respects this right in practice. There is religious instruction in the
 schools in the state religion the Evangelical Lutheran Church, but any student may
 without sanction be excused from religion classes with parental permission.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The law provides for these rights, and the Government respects them
 in practice. The Government cooperates with the United Nations Iigh Commis-
 sioner for Refugees and other humanitarian organizations in assisting refugees.
 There were no reports of forced expulsion of those having a valid claim to refugee
 status.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The law provides citizens with the right to change their government peacefully,
 and citizens exercise this right in practice through periodic, free, and fair elections
 held on the basis of universal suffrage.
 The territories of Greenland (whose population is primarily Inuit) and the Faroe
 Islands (whose inhabitants have their own Norse language) have democratically
 elected home-rule governments with powers encompassing a matters except foreign
 affairs, monetary affairs, and national security. Greenlanders and Faroese are Dan-
 ish citizens, with the same rights as those in the rest of the Kingdom. Each territory
 elects two representatives to the Folketing.
 In the current Government, 7 ministers (of 20) are women.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 A number of human rights groups operate without government restriction, inves-
 tigating and publishing their findings on human rights cases. Government officials
 are cooperative and responsive to their views.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Government's operations and extensive public services do not discriminate on
 the basis of any of these factors. The law prohibits discrimination on the basis of
 sex, and the law is effectively enforced by the Government. Discrimination on the
 basis of race is at present covered by two laws, which prohibit racial slander and
 denial of access to public places on the basis of race. Human rights organizations
 such as the Anti-Discrimination Center have criticized the Government for failing
 to expand legislation to other areas of potential discrimination. The rights of indige-
 nous people are carefully protected.
 Women.-An umbrella nongovernmental organization reports that in 1994, wom-
 en's crisis shelters were contacted 11,312 times, and 2,158 women stayed at shel-
 ters. There were 834 rapes and other cases of sexual assault. The law requires equal
 pay for equal work, but some wage inequality still exists. The law prohibits job dis-
 crimination on the basi of sex and rovides resources such as access to the Equal
 Status Council for those so affected.Vomen hold positions of authority throughout
 society, although they are underrepresented at the top of the business world. Wom-
 en's rights groups are effective in lobbying the Government in their areas of con-
 cern, e.g., wage disparities and parental leave.
 Chidren.-The Government demonstrates a strong commitment to children's
 rights and welfare through its well-funded systems of public education and medical
 care. Sections within thefinistries of Social Affairs, Justice, and Education oversee
 implementation of the Government's program for children. There is no pattern of
 societal abuse against children.
 People With Disabilities.-There is no discrimination against disabled persons in
 employment, education, or in the provision of other state services. Building regula-
 tions require special installations for the disabled in public buildings built or ren-
 ovated after 1977, and in older buildings that come into public use. The Government
 enforces these provisions in practice.
 Indigenous Peple.-The law protects the rights of the inhabitants of Greenland
 and the Faroe Islands. The Greenlandic legal system seeks to accommodate Inuit
 
 
 848
 
 customs. Accordingly, it provides for the use of lay people as judges, and it sentences
 most prisoners to holding centers (rather than to prisons) where they are encour-
 aged to work, hunt, or fish during the day. In Greenland, education is provided to
 the native population in both the Inuit and Danish languages.
 NationallRacial/Ethnic Minorities.-The inflow of ethnically and racially diverse
 refugees and immigrants has provoked a degree of tension between Danes and im-
 migrants (mostly Iranians, Palestinians, and Sri Lankans until late 1992; refugees
 are now overwhelmingly former Yugoslavs). Incidents of random, racially motivated
 violence do occur but are rare. The Government effectively investigates and deals
 with cases of racially motivated violence.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The law states that all workers, including military
 personnel and the police, may form or join unions of their choosing. Approximately
 80 percent of wage earners belong to unions, which are independent of the Govern-
 ment and political parties. The Danish Confederation of Trade Unions, which in-
 cludes about one-half of the country's work force, remains closely associated with
 the Social Democratic Party. Unions may affiliate freely with international organi-
 zations, and they do so actively. All unions except those representing civil servants
 or the military have the right to strike.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Workers and employers ac-
 knowledge each other's right to organize. Collective bargaining is protected by law
 and is widespread in practice. The law prohibits antiunion discrimination by em-
 ployers against union members and organizers, and there are mechanisms to resolve
 disputes. Employers found guilty of antiunion discrimination are required to rein-
 state workers fired for union activities. In the private sector, salaries, benefits, and
 working conditions are agreed upon in triennial negotiations between the various
 employers' associations and their union counterparts. If the negotiations fail, a na-
 tional conciliation board mediates, and its proposal is voted on by management and
 labor. If the proposal is turned down, the Government may force a legislated solu-
 tion on the parties (usually based upon the mediators' proposal). The agreements,
 in turn, are used as guidelines throughout the public as well as the private sector.
 In the public sector, collective bargaining is conducted between the employees'
 unions and a government group, led by the Finance Ministry.
 Labor relations in Greenland are conducted in the same manner as in Denmark.
 In disputes, Greenlandic courts are the first recourse, but Danish mediation services
 or the Danish Labor Court may also be used.
 In the Faroes, there is no umbrella labor organization, but individual unions en-
 gage in periodic collective bargaining with employers. Disputes are settled by medi-
 ation.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsoy Labor.-Forced or compulsory labor is pro-
 hibited by law, which the Government effectively enforces.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The minimum age for full-time
 employment is 15 years. The law prescribes specific limitations on the employment
 of those between 15 and 18 years of age, and it is enforced by the Danish Working
 Environment Service (DWES), an autonomous arm of the Ministry of Labor.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-There is no legally mandated national mini-
 mum wage, but national labor agreements effectively set a wage floor. The lowest
 wage paid is currently about $13 (DKr 75) per hour effective in September, which
 is sufficient for a decent standard of living for a worker and family. The law pro-
 vides for 5 weeks of paid vacation per year. A 37-hour workweek is the norm, estab-
 lished by contract, not by law. The law does, however, require at least 11 hours be-
 tween the end of one work period and the start of the next.
 The law also prescribes conditions of work, including safety and health; duties of
 employers, supervisors, and employees; work performance; rest periods and days off;
 and medical examinations. The DWES ensures compliance with labor legislation.
 Workers may remove themselves from hazardous situations or arms production
 without jeopardizing their employment rights, and there are legal protections for
 workers who file complaints about unsafe or unhealthy conditions.
 Similar conditions of work are found in Greenland and the Faroes, except that
 their workweek is 40 hours. As in Denmark, this is established by contract, not by
 law.
