 LESOTHO
 Lesotho is a constitutional monarchy. For most of the year, Prime Minister Ntsu
 Mokhele and his Basotholand Congress Party (BCP), which won all 65 seats in the
 lower house of Parliament in the 1993 elections, controlled the Government and the
 legislature. After holding open several appointive Senate seats for the opposition
 Basotho National Party (BNP), the BCP Government finally filled the vacancies in
 early 1994 with BCP members, further exacerbating BCP-BNP tensions. Following
 serious fighting within the militay early in the year, King Letsie III touched off
 a constitutional crisis by suspending Parliament and parts of the Constitution and
 ruled by decree during August and September.
 Although the King has no executive authority under the 1993 Constitution, he
 justified the suspension of Parliament by alleging that the BCP-led Government had
 inored several constitutional provisions. The King demanded the return of his fa-
 ther to the throne, former King Moshoeshoe II, who had been deposed by the pre-
 vious military government and exiled in 1990. Under national and international
 pressure, the King and political leaders reached an agreement in September to re-
 store the Constitution and reinstate the BCP Government, with the Government
 committing itself to address speedily the royal family's insistence that King
 
 
 Moshoeshoe H return. At year's end, the BCP Government struggled to bridge the
 political divisions and constitutional weaknesses highlighted by the palace coup.
 The Lesotho Defense Force (LDF) is responsible for internal and border security,
 assisted by the Lesotho Mounted Police (LMP). While the LDF is nominally respon-
 Eible to the Defense Minister and the IMP to the Home Affairs Minister, both serv-
 ices' actions and policies are under the ultimate control of the Defense Commission,
 which is independent of Parliament. In January the LDF split into factions that bat-
 tled one another across Maseru, causing several civilian casualties. In April LDF
 soldiers briefly held hostage several government ministers and killed the Deputy
 Prime Minister. In May the LMP went on strike over pay demands and in some
 cases encouraged looting of unprotected businesses. Both the LDF and the LMP sup-
 ported King Letsie's August coup, and the security forces shot and killed demonstra-
 tors and reportedly perpetrated acts of torture and other human rights abuses dur-
 ing the month-long constitutional suspension.
 A land-locked country surrounded by South Africa, Lesotho is almost entirely de-
 pendent on its sole neighbor for trade, finance, employment, and access to the out-
 side world. A large proportion of the adult male work force is employed in South
 African mines. Miners' remittances play a substantial role in Lesotho's balance of
 payments, accounting for around 40 percent of gross national product in 1994.
 State-owned organizations predominate in the agroindustrial and agribusiness sec-
 tors, but private sector activity dominates in manufacturing and construction.
 Under Lesotho's traditional chieftainship structure, land is controlled by the chiefs
 and owned by the Kingdom, precluding private ownership of land.
 Throughout the year, security forces and political activists committed serious
 human rights abuses. Against a backdrop of sustained political tension, there were
 serious lapses in both LF and LMP discipline and p rofessionalism. Military and
 police personnel engaged in extrajudicial killings, arbItrry arrest and detention of
 persons, and torture and physically abuse of senior government officials and many
 others. As a result of complex political circumstances, the weakened BCP Govern-
 ment took no action to curb military and police brutality or to punish the offenders.
 The Government acknowledged that a number of preexisting laws were inconsistent
 with human rights provisions of the new Constitution but did not act to repeal the
 laws. For example, the legal provisions that allowed for lengthy detentions without
 trial continued in force. Women's rights continued to be severely restricted, and vio-
 lence against women remained widespread.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extra judicial Kdling.-Security forces committed a number
 of political and extrajudicial killings of civilians through factional battles, several
 mutinous actions, or in efforts to oust the elected Government. In April LDF soldiers
 killed Deputy Prime Minister Selometsi Baholo during an apparent kidnaping at-
 tempt, and in early January, three soldiers were killed and at least eight civilians
 wounded in fighting between LDF factions in the capital. In December police alleg-
 edly beat to death a senior figure of the now-disbanded Lesotho Liberation Army,
 the armed wing of the BCP, while under arrest for suspected criminal activities.
 In August the security forces, who supported the King, fired into large demonstra-
 tions by supporters of the BCP Government, killin five persons outside Maseru's
 royal palace gates. LDF and LMP forces killed another five persons during celebra-
 tions of the impending Government's reinstatement, held in violation of a dusk-to-
 dawn curfew. Police also killed at least one BCP protester in southern Lesotho dur-
 ing  march against BNP opposition politicians.
 e authorities did not investigate or prosecute any law enforcement officials in
 1994 for any extrajudicial or summary killing. They also failed to investigate the
 many reports of police brutality, including pre-1994 reports of deaths in police cus-
 tody of a number of unionists and criminal suspects.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically related disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 There continued to be credible reports of police brutality, including beatings of de-
 tainees in 1994. Police tortured one Member of Parliament by continuously pouring
 water on him during extended detention after he led a progovernment march during
 the August coup. There were numerous credible reports of random security force
 brutality against curfew violators during August and September, usually in the form
 of beatings.
 In general, prison facilities in Lesotho are overcrowded and in disrepair, but do
 not threaten the health or lives of inmates. Conditions are not monitored independ-
 ently. Rape is not a significant problem in prisons.

 d. Arbitray Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-During the April and May mutinies, LDF
 and LMP members arbitrarily arrested and detained cabinet members and other
 senior government officials. They arrested dozens of striking workers at various tex-
 tile factories and construction sites.
 In general, pretrial detainees constitute a significant portion of total prison popu-
 lation; up to one-half, in some locations. Because of backlogs, pretrial remand can
 last several years.
 Persons detained or arrested in criminal cases, and defendants in civil cases, have
 the right to legal counsel. The 1981 Criminal Procedures and Evidence Act, as
 amended in 1984, makes provision for the granting of bail. Bail is granted regularly
 and generally fairly.
 Although the Government acknowledged that the Internal Security (General) Act
 (ISA) of 1984 is partly inconsistent with human rights provisions in the new Con-
 stitution, the ISA remains in force. The Act provides for so-called investigative de-
 tention without charge or trial in political cases for up to 42 days (the first 14 days
 on order of the police; the second 14 days on order of the police commissioner, and
 the final 14 days on order of the Minister of Defense-a portfolio now held by the
 Prime Minister). A political case involves "subversion," a term loosely defined in the
 ISA to include "any act or thing prejudicial to public order, the security of Lesotho,
 or the administration of justice." The Act also allows for detention of witnesses in
 security cases and permits the Minister of Defense to 'restrict" a person who, in the
 opinion of the police commissioner, is conducting himself in a manner prejudicial to
 public order, security, or the administration of justice.
 There were no known restrictions or detentions under the Act in 1994; legal pro-
 fessionals held that any such attempt to detain persons would promptly be declared
 unconstitutional by the High Court. There were no known political detainees at
 year's end.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The judiciary consists of the Court of Appeal
 (which meets semiannually), the High Court, magistrate's courts, and customary or
 traditional courts which exist largely in rural areas to administer customary law.
 The High Court Chief Justice's decision in Au st to swear in a provisional ruling
 council after King Letsie's coup, in defiance ofthe Constitution, raised new ques-
 tions about the independence of the judiciary. In particular, magistrates appear sus-
 ceptible to governmental or chieftainship influence. Accused persons have and use
 the right to counsel and public trial. The authorities generally respect court deci-
 sions and rulings.
 There is no trial by jury. Criminal trials are normally adjudicated by a single
 High Court judge who presides, with two assessors serving in an advisory capacity.
 In civil cases judges normally hear cases alone. The High Court also provides proce-
 dural and substantive advice and guidance on matters of legal procedure to military
 tribunals; however, it does not participate in arriving at judgments. Military tribu-
 nals have jurisdiction only over military cases, and their decisions may not be ap-
 pealed.
 There were no trials for political offenses in 1994. There are no known political
 prisoners. Lesotho's law and custom severely limit the rights of women (see Section
 5), but court treatment of women is not known to be discriminatory in itself.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-Al-
 though search warrants are usually required under normal circumstances, the ISA
 provides police with wide powers to stop and search persons and vehicles and to
 enter homes and other places for similar purposes without a warrant. After the May
 LMP mutiny, police officers entered without warrant dozens of residences in the
 Maseru neighborhoods of Sea Point and Matimposo, allegedly seeking looted prop-
 erty. The security services are believed to monitor routinely telephone conversations
 of Basotho and foreigners on national security grounds.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for these rights,
 which are generally respected in practice. However, the Xing suspended the Con-
 stitution during the August-September palace coup, and security force personnel
 censored the official media outlets to reflect antigovernment positions. Under the
 elected Government, the official media, which consist of one radio station, a 1-hour
 daily newscast on a local television channel, and two weekly newspapers, faithfully
 reflect official positions.
 The independent newspapers, including one each controlled by the Roman Catho-
 lic and Lesotho Evangelical churches, and two English-language weeklies, routinely
 criticized the Government. Independent newspapers covered coup events but secu-
 rity forces intimidated some journalists into practicing self-censorship during this
 period.

 Academic freedom is generally respected. Students staged political meetings on
 the National University campus in response to the palace coup. However, the uni-
 versity Vice-Chancellor warned the teaching staff that openly political activities
 were incompatible with their civil service status.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-Under a mid-1993 revision of
 the ISA, a public meeting, rally, or march no longer requires prior police permission,
 only advance notification. However, police or local authorities repeatedly interfered
 with this right.
 In August after the palace coup, LDF and LIMP forces killed and wounded several
 demonstrators when they dispersed a large crowd of peaceful progovernment
 protestors. Police also used excessive force to enforce the curfew instituted between
 August and September (see also Section L.a.).
 Inaddition to the BCP and the BNP, there are several smaller -political parties.
 Political party meetings and rallies occurred regularly throughout Lesotho in 1994.
 There are no restrictions on political parties.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-There is no state religion, and all faiths may worship free
 of government restriction.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-Citizens generally are able to move freely within the country and across
 national boundaries. The Government places no obstacles in the way of citizens who
 wish to emigrate.
 As of late 1994, the Government had allowed about 25 refugees to register with
 the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) to study in Lesotho.
 They were expected to return to their countries of first asylum after completing
 their studies. Other than these students, Lesotho has no resident refugee popu-
 lation.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 After the first multiparty democratic elections in over 20 years in 1993, the elect-
 ed BCP Government was forced to contend with its first serious threat to power.
 The August coup, instigated by King Letsie III, inspired many Basotho to dem-
 onstrate their support or the democractically elected BCP Government. Organized
 labor and others -held two national "stayaways" to demonstrate support for the
 ousted Government, and there were numerous rallies at the National University. As
 a result of both local and international pressure, in September, the King reversed
 the coup and the BCP regained control of the Government. An agreement between
 the King and Prime Minister Mokhehle, brokered by South Africa, Botswana, and
 Zimbabwe, called for the reinstatement of ex-King Moshoeshoe 11, Letsie's father,
 in addition to steps to broaden Lesotho's political process. By December both houses
 of Parliament had passed a bill to return Moshoeshoe to the throne, and the Gov-
 ernment was expected to act early in 1995 to arrange his return.
 The Kings suspension of the Constitution, although short-lived, highlighted the
 fragility of constitutional rule in Lesotho. Opposition politicians who supported the
 palace coup called for new elections, but at year's end the Government indicated it
 had no plans to call elections prior to 1998.
 There are no legal impediments to women's participation in government or poli-
 tics, but women remained under represented in politics. There is one woman in the
 Cabinet, as Minister of Health and Social Welfare. There are 2 other female mem-
 bers of the Assembly (out of a total of 65), and 7 women (of 33) in the Senate.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Neither the Government nor the briefly installed palace regime hindered the ac-
 tivities of various nongovernmental human rights groups. These groups freely criti-
 cized the Government and the coup regime. The Government's attitude toward
 international human rights groups is untested, as Lesotho has not been visited dur-
 ing this Government's tenure. However, there is no reason to believe the Govern-
 ment would be hostile to or oppose such a visit.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Language, Disability, or So-
 cial Status
 The 1993 Constitution prohibits discrimination based on race, color, sex, lan-
 guage, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, birth or other
 status.
 Women.-Both law and custom severely limit the rights of women in such areas
 as property, inheritance, and contracts. Women have the legal and customary right
 to make a will and sue for divorce. However, under Lesotho's customary law, a mar-
 ried woman is considered a minor during the lifetime of her husband; she cannot
 
 
 enter into any legally binding contract, whether for employment, commerce, or edu-
 cation, without her husband's consent. A woman married under customary law has
 no standing in court and may not sue or be sued without her husband's permission.
 The Government has not addressed the issue of women's rights.
 Domestic violence, including wife beating, occurs frequently. Statistics are not
 available, but the problem is believed widespread. In Basotho tradition a wife may
 return to her "maiden home" if physically abused by her husband; in common law,
 wife beating is a criminal offense and defined as assault. Few domestic violence
 cases are brought to trial. Women's rights organizations, such as the local chapter
 of the International Federation of Women Lawyers, have taken a leading role in
 educating Basotho women as to their rights under customary and common law,
 highlighting the importance of women fully part        in the democratic process.
 Children.-The Government has not addressed        y children's rights and wel-
 fare, although it has devoted substantial resources to primary and secondary edu-
 cation. There is no pattern of societal abuse against children, but many children are
 working at a young age (see Section 6.d.).
 NationallRaciallEthnic Minorities.-Most citizens speak a common language and
 share common historical and cultural traditions. Small numbers of Asians (pri-
 marily ethnic Chinese and Indians) and South African whites are active in the coun-
 try's commercial life. Economic and racial tension between the Chinese business
 community, specifically textile and garment industry employers, and the Basotho re-
 mained a problem.
 People With Disabiities.-The Government has not legislated or mandated acces-
 sibility to public buildings for the handicapped.
 Discrimination against physically disabled persons in employment, education, or
 provision of other government services is unlawful. However, societal discrimination
 is commonplace.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Workers have the legal right to join or form unions
 without prior government authorization. A large percentage of Lesotho's male labor
 force works in South African gold and coal mines. The remainder are primarily en-
 gaged in traditional agriculture. There is a small public and industrial sector. A ma-
 jority of Basotho mineworkers are members of the South African National Union of
 Mineworkers (NUM). However, as a foreign organization, the NUM is not permitted
 to engage in union activities in Lesotho.
 Under the 1993 Labor Code, prepared with the assistance of the International
 Labor Organization (ILO), all trade union federations require government registra-
 tion. Lesotho's previously existing trade union federations, the Lesotho Labor Con-
 gress and the Congress of Democratic Unions, attempted to merge but split again
 in 1994, to form the Lesotho Trade Union Congress (LTUC) and the Lesotho Federa-
 tion of Democratic Unions (LFDU). The Government registred neither federation
 but made no attempt to inhibit either federations activities. Unions are not tied to
 political parties.
 Overall, unionized workers represent only about 10 percent of the total work
 force. After the Government _grantd substantial wage and benefit concessions to the
 LDF and LMP in June, 1994, labor movement militancy increased. There were doz-
 ens of strikes in the textile, garment, and construction sectors. The Government did
 not stop security forces from occasionally violently suppressing workers participat-
 ing wildcat strikes including by tear gas beatings, and detentions.
 orcedtesfor settling disputes are lengty and cumbersome, and no legally sanc-
 tioned strike has ever occurred in Lasotho since independence in 1966. The Govern-
 ment recognized none of the dozens of strikes in 1994 as "legal. Legal protection
 for strikers against retribution has not been enforced in cases of filegal strikes; em-
 ployers dismissed several hundred workers in the textile industry following wildcat
 strikes, and the Government maintained it could not oblige their employers to rein-
 state them.
 There were no instances in 1994 of governmental restrictions on international af-
 filiations of contacts by unions or their members.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Conectively.-AIl legally recognized trade
 unions in Lesotho in principle enjoy the right in law to organize and bargain collec-
 tively, but in practice  authorities often restrict these rights. Although there was
 some bargaining between unions and employers to set wage and bnefit rates, em-
 ployers generally continued to set wage rates through unilateral action.
 Lesotho has several industrial zones, in which mostly textile and apparel finns
 engge in manufacturing for export. All national labor laws apply in these industrial
 zones, but officials of the Lesotho Amalgamated Clothing  xtile Workers Union
 
 
 charge that the Government colludes with employers to inhibit union organizational
 activities in the workplace.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The 1987 Employment Act pro-
 hibits forced or compulsory labor, and there is no indication that such labor is prac-
 ticed.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The legal minimum age for em-
 ployment in commercial or industrial enterprises is 14. In practice, however, chil-
 dren under 14 are often employed in the textile and garment sector and in family
 owned businesses. As much as 15 percent of the textile work force of some 12,000-
 15,000 may be children between the ages of 12 and 15, according to a 1994 US.
 Department of Labor study. There are prohibitions against the employment of mi-
 nors in commercial, industrial, or nonfamily enterprises involving hazardous or dan-
 gerous working conditions, but enforcement is very lax. The Ministry of Labor and
 Employment's inspectorate is grossly understaffed. Basotho under 18 years of age
 may not be recruited for employment outside of Lesotho. In Lesotho's traditional so-
 ciety, rigorous working conditions for the country's young "herdboys" are considered
 a prerequisite to manhood and a fundamental feature of Basotho culture beyond the
 reach of labor laws.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work-Wages are low despite the Government's April
 decision to raise statutory minimum wages for various types of work. Monthly mini-
 mum wages in the established categories range from the equivalent of $83 (294
 Maloti) for an unskilled laborer to $161 (565 Maloti) for a heavy vehicle driver. At
 the low end, minimum wages are insufficient to ensure a minimum decent standard
 of living for a worker and family. Most wage earners supplement their income
 through subsistence agriculture or remittances from relatives employed in South Af-
 rica. Many employers in Lesotho now pay more than minimum wages in an effort
 to attract and retain motivated employees.
 The 1993 Labor Code spolls out basic worker rights, including a 45-hour work-
 week, a weekly rest period of at least 24 hours, 12 days' paid leave per year, and
 paid public holidays. The Code requires employers to provide adequate light, ven-
 tilation, and sanitary facilities for employees, and to install and maintain machinery
 to minimize the risk of injury. In practice, employers generally follow these regula-
 tions only within the wage economy, in urban areas, and the Ministry of Labor and
 Employment enforces the regulations haphazardly. The Labor Code does not explic-
 itly protect the right of work ers to remove themselves from hazardous situations
 without prejudice to employment. But Labor Code sections on safety in the work-
 place, and dismissal, imply that dismissal in such circumstances would not be legal.
