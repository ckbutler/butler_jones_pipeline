 MOZAMBIQUE
 Following decades of war, Mozambique enjoyed in 1994 its second year of peace
 and a significantly improved human rights situation. In the country's first
 multiparty elections October 27-29, President Joaquim Chissano and the National
 Front for the Liberation of Mozambique (FRELIMO, which has ruled Mozambique
 since independence in 1975) won 53.3 percent of the presidential vote and 44 per-
 cent of the parliamentary vote (129 of 250 legislative seats). Afonso Dhlakama, the
 leader of the former insurgent movement, the Mozambique National Resistance
 (RENAMO), received 33.7 percent of the presidential vote and-with a popular ma-
 jority in half the provinces-38 percent of the parliamentary vote (112 seats). Al-
 though Dhlakama threatened to pull out of the elections at the last minute and
 later charged that there were serious irregularities in the voting process, he said
 RENAMO would abide by the results. The U.N. Special Representative and other
 international observers declared the elections generally free and fair.
 On December 8-9, Chissano and the Parliament-elect were sworn in. At year's
 end, political tensions resurfaced after Chissano declined to appoint any RENO
 members to the Cabinet and resisted RENAMO's demands that they be consulted
 in the naming of overnors for the provinces in which RENAMO won a majority of
 the vote. RENAO walked out of the opening parliamentary session, protesting
 that FRELIMO was attempting to continue one-party government as usual. It re-
 mains to be seen whether the new multiparty legislature will have any more re-
 sources, authority, or independence than its predecessors.
 Despite occasional lapses by both FRELIMO and RENAMO in adhering to the
 General Peace Accord of October 1992 which ended the civil war, the U.N. peace-
 keeping force (ONUMOZ) successfully oversaw the cease-fire and the 2-year transi-
 tion to multiparty elections. ONUMOZ's mandate ended December 9 with the swear-
 ing in of President Chissano; its withdrawal from Mozambique is scheduled to be
 completed by January 31, 1995.
 The status of the military and security apparatus remained in flux for most of
 the year. The Peace Accord specified that FRELIMO and RENAMO would each
 transfer 15,000 soldiers to a new, unified army. However, in an attempt to keep a
 military option open, both the Government and RENAMO made efforts to slow the
 planned demobiization of their 75,000 (total) troops and the establishment of the
 
 
 171
 new Mozambique armed defense force (FADM). However, the pace of demobilization
 was forced when thousands of disaffected soldiers, having waited months in assem-
 bly areas, mutinied or simply deserted. At year's end, the FADM was comprised of
 only about 11,500 soldiers according to the Government. Given this downsized mili-
 tary establishment and the absence of any threat from its neighbors, all of whom
 are ruled by democratically elected governments, Mozambique should find it pos-
 sible to drastically reduce military expenditures.
 FRELIMO internal security forces included the controversial intelligence arm, the
 State Information and Security Service (SISE), the Criminal Investigation Police
 (PIC) the Mozambique National Police (PRM), and the Rapid Reaction-Police (PIR).
 The Peace Accord placed SISE under the supervision of a 21-member monitoring
 committee (COMINFO) of government and RENAMO representatives and independ-
 ent citizens, and a 1993 Chissano-Dhlakama agreement gave ONUMOZ responsibil-
 ity for overseeing the Mozambican police force. As part of this agreement, almost
 1,000 international civilian police (CIVPOL) monitors arrived to monitor police ac-
 tivities. Despite the presence of the latter, police forces committed a number of
 human rights abuses, and prior to the elections the Government violated the Peace
 Accord by transferring a significant quantity of arms and men to the police, includ-
 ing to the presidential security force.
 The economy is largely agricultural, with approximately 80 percent of the popu-
 lation involvedin small scale, subsistence farming. Major exports are shrimp, sugar,
 cotton, and cashew nuts. While near normal rains and continuing peace permitted
 many Mozambicans, including returning refugees and the internally displaced_to
 farm their lands again, the economy remained heavily dependent on foreign aid. Mo-
 zambique, continuing the transition from a centrally planned economy to a market-
 based system, is privatizing many government-owned companies and attempting to
 attract foreign investment. Nevertheless, Mozambique, remains one of the world's
 poorest countries, with a per capita income of only $80 annually.
 Although the overall human rights situation in Mozambique continued to improve
 in 1994, the Government, and to a lesser extent RENAMO, continued to commit se-
 rious human rights abuses. Despite the presence of international police trainers po-
 lice continued to commit abuses, including instances of extrajudicial killings and ex-
 cessive use of force, and routinely beat and otherwise abused detainees. The Govern-
 ment rarely investigated such abuses or punished those responsible. Citizens some-
 times turned to mob justice as a way to counter the ineffective and corrupt police
 force. The weak judiciary continued to be unable to implement constitutional guar-
 antees of individual human rights or provide an effective check on the power of the
 executive branch. Early in the year RENAMO and FRELIMO traded accusations
 that they could not operate in areas under each other's control. Throughout the
 year, freedom of movement was severely hampered at times by armed bandits and
 FAM and RENAMO soldiers awaiting demobilization, who contributed to criminal
 activity by blocking roads, detaining civilians, and extorting money and food. Other
 human rights problems included harsh prison conditions, press restrictions, and vio-
 lence against women.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Kllin .-There were no known reports of po-
 litical killings by the Government or RENA O. However, the Mozambique National
 Police committed a number of extrajudicial killings. For example, in January in
 Nampula province, an off-duty police officer arrested and subsequently beat to death
 a pharmacy owner. Also, in July, in Quelimane in Zambezia province, police beat
 to death a RENAMO guard, Andre Filip, while he was in custody. As far as known,
 the Government took no action against the officers involved in this incident.
 The rise of criminal activity, combined with police corruption and a weak judicial
 system (see Section l.e.) led to an increase in mob-vigilante kinings, often involving
 necklacing, a method of killing and torture in which gasoline-filled tires are placed
 around a victim's neck and set alight. A medical journal reported that doctors had
 treated 18 young men in Maputo's central hospital over a 12-month period for so-
 vere burns caused by necklacing. Most of the 18 did not survive. The local press
 frequently reported instances of angry mobs beating or even -lynching suspected
 thieves.
 b. Disappearance.-There was one report of an alleged government-perpetrated
 disappearance. In a complaint filed with the Cease-Fire Commission (0CF), one of
 the commissions established to oversee implementation of the Peace Accord,
 RENAMO accused the Government of responsibility for the disappearance in May
 of Renuge Paconote, a former government soldier, who claimed to have evidence
 
 
 172
 that the Government was training troops in Tanzania in violation of the cease-fire.
 The Government denied the allegation and requested that the CCF suspend the in-
 vestigation. The investigation proceeded but failed to reach any conclusions about
 Paconote's whereabouts.
 A number of members of the Presidential Guard, including Alberto Gomes, re-
 mained missing in 1994, following government suppression of a 1993 mutiny in the
 Guard. The Government reportedly refused to respond to a request by former sol-
 diers that it establish a commission of inquiry. To date, there has been no news of
 Gomes' whereabouts or any indication that there will be an investigation into the
 matter.
 In another case, a government soldier held by RENAMO at a base in Zambezia
 in 1993 remained missing in 1994. RENAMO claims the soldier fled before he could
 be transferred to government custody in October 1993.
 The fate of thousands of Mozambicans who disappeared during the civil war re-
 main unresolved.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Although the Constitution expressly prohibits torture, there were credible reports
 that the Mozambique Police Forces routinely beat and whipped detainees, which
 sometimes resulted in death (see Section L.a). Police routinely assaulted those sus-
 pected of even minor crimes.
 In Montepuez, Cabo Delgado province, three RENAMO members were detained
 by police in September for 3 days and severely beaten before being released without
 charges. In December RENAMO leaders also maintained that their supporters were
 being detained, harassed, and beaten by police in a number of provinces, but these
 charges could not be confirmed.
 Corruption in the police forces extended throughout the ranks; the PRM also used
 threats of violence and detention to intimidate people from reporting abuses, as in
 the case of Rosario Sweleke, a Radio Mozambique journalist who reported on alleged
 police criminal activity (see Section 2.a.). On occasion, the Government has =en
 action to counter police abuses. For example, in January the Interior Minister an-
 nounced that 100 police had been expelled because of corruption and abuse of au-
 thority. In December the Police Commander of Maputo announced that 50 police-
 men were being prosecuted for "irregularities" committed during the election period.
 Harsh prison conditions continued to deteriorate during the year. Medical and
 food supplies were often insufficient, and overcrowding remained a serious problem.
 In some provincial prisons, men and women do not have separate facilities, and vio-
 lence against women, particularly rape by guards and other prisoners, was a serious
 problem. At year's end, Machava prison, the largest in Mozambique, located on the
 outskirts of Maputo, held over twice the number of inmates for which it was built
 and others held up to four times their intended capacity. The Government permitted
 international human rights groups, including the International Committee of the
 Red Cross (ICRC) access to prisons.
 During 1994 RENAMO began to allow nongovernmental organizations (NGO's)
 much greater access to children in their custody, some of whom had been forced to
 become soldiers (see Section 5).
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The law requires that most detainees be
 charged or released within 30 days. However, persons accused of the most serious
 crimes, i.e. security offenses or those requiring a sentence of more than 8 years, may
 be detained for up to 84 days without being formally charged. With court approv,
 such detainees may be held for two additional periods of 84 days while the police
 complete their investigation. In practice, however, these rules are often ignored. The
 detainee's constitutional rights to counsel and to contact relatives or friends are also
 frequently not respected. The Government has broad latitude for determining what
 constitutes a security offense.
 Citizens are also often unaware of their rights, particularly those granted under
 the 1990 Constitution, and detainees may spend many months, even years, in pre-
 trial status. In some cases, detainees may be released from prison while the inves-
 tigation proceeds, but the bail system remains poorly defined, and the police often
 take bribes to effect the release of those who can afford to pay. The law provides
 that if the prescribed period for investigation has been completed and no charges
 have been brought, the detainee must be released. In practice, however, this law is
 often ignored, in both regular and security cases, in part because of the severe lack
 of administrative personnel, trained judges, and sufficient lawyers to monitor the
 judicial system (see Section i.e.).
 Throughout 1994 the serious backlog of pretrial detainees continued, and the Gov-
 ernment made little effort to address this problem. A Mozambican human rights or-
 ganization, the League of Human Rights (LDH), found that Machava prison alone
 had over 500 prisoners awaiting trail beyond the constitutionally mandated legal de-
 
 
 tention period. In one case, an attorney reported that a client had been held for 15
 months withc.ut trial only to be found not guilty when he was finally able to stand
 trial. In another case, the LDH reported that a 52-year-old woman, accused of her
 husband's murder, was still awaiting trial after 3 years of detention.
 In May the Nampula police detained Rosario Sweleke, a Radio Mozambique jour-
 nalist, on charges of defaming the local police for reporting on alleged criminal po-
 lice activity. He was held for several hours.
 The 1990 Constitution expressly prohibits exile, and the Government does not use
 exile as a means of political control.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trail.-The 1990 Constitution formally established an
 independent judiciary and specifically states that the decisions of the courts take
 precedence over all other authorities and individuals and must be obeyed. Neverthe-
 less, the executive, and by extension the FRELIMO party, dominates the judiciary.
 In general, judges are beholden for their positions to the ruling FRELIMO party,
 which exercises significant influence on all aspects of public life through the execu-
 tive and through party organs. Moreover, the Presidentappoints the members of the
 most important tribunal, the Supreme Court and prior to the October elections,
 these were automatically ratifiect by the FRELIMO-appointed National Assembl
 At year's end, it was unclear whether the newly elected National Assembly would
 assert it prerogatives and strengthen the independence of the judiciary.
 The Government has also ignored court decisions. For example, in August the De-
 fense Ministry refused to obey a court order that it compensate a goods vehicle driv-
 er for the loss of his truck when an army driver ran into him in 1986.
 There are two complementary formal justice systems-the civil/criminal, which in-
 cludes customary courts and the military justice system. At the apex of both sys-
 tems is the Supreme Court. A 1991 law empowered the Supreme Court to admin-
 ister the civil/criminal stem; it also hears appeals, including military cases al-
 though the Ministry of Defense administers the military system. In addition, focal
 customary courts handle matters such as estate and divorce cases. In the regular
 courts, all accused persons are in theory presumed innocent and have the right to
 legal counsel and ap~peal, but the authorities do not always respect these rights.
 Sine the establishment of the Supreme Court in 1988 andthe abolition of the
 Revolutionary Military Tribunal, persons accused of crimes against the State are
 tried in common civilian courts under standard criminal judicialprocedures. A judge
 may order a trial closed because of national security interests or to protect the pri-
 vacy of the p laintiff in rape cases.
 RENAMO continued during the year to administer the areas under its control
 through a rudimentary form of civil administration and traditional courts, often
 using-RENAMO commanders as judges.
 The issue of political prisoners remained controversial. In 1992 the Government
 held an estimated 400 to 550 national security prisoners, most of whom were ac-
 cused of sympathizing with, or committing crimes on behalf of, RENAMO. The Octo-
 ber 1992 Rome Accords provided for the release of such prisoners, and the National
 Assembly passed an amnesty law in 1992 allowing over 300 prisoners to be released.
 In 1994, as in 1993, the Government claimed that there were no national security
 prisoners.
 However, in August the National Information Commission (COMINFO), estab-
 lished under the Peace Accord to monitor the activities of SISE, accused the Govern-
 ment of continuing to hold political prisoners. COMINFO's RENAMO-appointed
 chairman alleged that a RENAMO prisoner, Alexandre Niquisse, had been released
 from prison only in August. The COMINFO chairman accused SISE of "hiding' ap-
 proximately 60 political prisoners, including Niquisse, in Inhambane province by re-
 classifying them as criminals. The chairman further speculated that more political
 prisoners continued to be held in detention throughout the country. When inter-
 viewed by the press about the allegations, the Minister of Justice downplayed the
 seriousness of the charge, but he admitted that bureaucratic mistakes could have
 occurred. The Government's handling of the Niquisse case lends credence to the
 COMINFO findings.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 1990 Constitution provides for the right to privacy and expressly prohibits the use
 of surveillance techniques. By law, police need a warrant to enter-homes and busi-
 nesses, but in practice most policemen routinely operate without them. During the
 war, police andsecurity forces entered homes at will, used a variety of surveillance
 techniques, and often forced civilians to move into government-protected villages.
 However, since the signing of the Rome Accords, the number of reported incidents
 of intrusive government actions declined markedly.
 Although there are fewer reports of such activity, incidents of illegal telephone
 wiretapping by Government intelligence agencies allegedly still occur. In November
 
 
 174
 the independent weekly Savana reported what it considered convincing evidence
 that a telephone conversation between two of its journalists was tapped. The SISE
 denied the charge.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution, the 1991 Press Law, and the
 1992 Rome Peace Accords provide for freedom of expression and the press, except
 in cases involving national defense considerations. In practice, however, the Govern-
 ment restricts these freedoms. Although criticism of the President is not legally pro-
 hibited, the 1991 Press Law holds that, in cases of defamation against the Presi-
 dent, truth is not a sufficient defense against libel. Although this law had not been
 tested in court, it resulted in considerable media self-censorship and almost no di-
 rect criticism of the President.
 The Government dominates the media through direct control of the most impor-
 tant means of reaching the public, radio and television. The Government owns
 Radio Mozambique and Television Mozambique, TVM, and also controls, either di-
 rectly or indirectly, the most important newspapers such as Domingo and Noticias.
 Radio Mozambique reaches the largest number of Mozambicans. The official media
 do not criticize government officials or policies, even though corruption at the min-
 isterial level is common knowledge. The only independent television station began
 its second year of broadcasts in 1994. While independent administratively and fi-
 nancially from the Government, the station is owned by a FRELIMO Central Com-
 mittee member, and programming has not taken an independent political line.
 The government-controlled media frequently ignored or distorted Rome Accord is-
 sues and regularly criticized RENAMO military and political leaders for alleged vio-
 lations of the Accord. The government media also targeted the U.N. Special Rep-
 resentative and various members of the diplomatic community, particularly as the
 October elections approached. They were subjected to an orchestrated campaign
 which impugned their motives and falsely alleged various conspiracies against the
 peace process.
 There were several incidents in which security officials harassed the press. For
 example, in May the Nampula Chief of Police castigated the media for criticizing
 the police, and the police arbitrarily detained Radio Mozambique announcer Rosario
 Swelke for several hours (see Section 1.c.). The Governor intervened to release
 Swelke, and the Higher Council of Social Communications (CSCS), an oversight
 organ mandated by the Press Law, and the Independent National Organization of
 Journalists investigated the incident.
 Notwithstanding the dominance of the official media, there is a small, but growing
 independent press that includes several daily facsimile (FAX) newsletters which
 carry opposition viewpoints. However, the influence of this independent press and,
 for that matter, of the official press as well, is limited largely to Maputo and the
 provincial capitals.
 During the official 33-day election campaign, all parties, including RENAMO and
 other opposition parties, had an opportunity to present their views on Radio Mozam-
 biqhe and television at no cost, in accordance with the Electoral Law, and the guide-
 lines established by the nonpartisan National Elections Commission. The media also
 featured nonpartisan voter education programs.
 RENAMO published a magazine, Novos Tempos, and its radio station, Voz de
 Renamo began nationwide shortwave and Maputo-only FM      broadcasts in 1994.
 RENAMO continually criticized the Government, often without any factual basis.
 There are no formal restrictions on academic freedom, but, in practice, teachers
 routinely adhere to self-censorship since their employment depends on the State.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Associaton.-The Constitution provides for
 freedom of assembly, and there were no known incidents of the authorities denying
 permission for groups to hold public marches or demonstrations. However, security
 forces used excessive force on several occasions in controlling unauthorized dem-
 onstrations, killing and wounding several persons. In July in Xai-Xai, Gaza prov-
 ince, rapid intervention forces fired on crowds demanding the return of possessions
 from PM members they suspected of theft, injuring several demonstrators.
 During 1994, 18 registered political parties, including the two largest, FRELIMO
 and RENAMO, held congresses and press conferences and traveled in areas under
 government control. Although the electoral campaign was generally peaceful, there
 emerged a pattern of FRELIMO harassment of opposition parties throughout the
 country. This often involved heckling and stoning opposition candidates and system-
 atic defacing of opposition campaign material. FRELIMO also made extensive use
 of state resources in its campaign and used governmental powers to coerce cam-
 paign contributions from local businessmen. FRELIMO accused RENAMO of pre-
 venting government campaigners from going into RENAMO areas, but there was lit-
 
 
 tie independent evidence to support these allegations. RENAMO accepted the elec-
 toral outcome, although it claimed that many irregularities had prevented the proc-
 ess from being "fair."i
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution mandates strict separation of church
 and state. It provides for the freedom to "practice or not practice a religion" and
 also gives religious institutions the right to own property and operate schools. The
 Government respects these rights in practice.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Constitution provides for freedom of travel within the country and
 abroad. The Government no longer requires citizens to obtain permits from local au-
 thorities in order to travel within the country. The Government began to enforce a
 law requiring disprportionately heavy fines for foreigners who overstayed their
 visas.
 The unstable security situation in the country remained the greatest threat to
 freedom of movement. In mid-1994, government and RENAMO soldiers demanding
 immediate demobilization frequently detoined and robbed travelers along major
 highways. Using trumped-up charges, police also frequently stopped truck drivers
 and foreign visitors and demanded bribes from them.
 During the year, RENAMO permitted increased travel to its controlled areas, al-
 though it insisted that in order to ensure safety, relief workers and others had to
 carry RENAMO passes. During the initial phases of the voter registration cam-
 paign, electoral workcers hesitated to enter RENAMO zones unless security guards
 were escorting them, but later they entered all RENAMO zones freely.
 With the end of the civil war and the return of the rains after the worst drought
 on record in 1992, citizens who had been internally displaced or had sought refuge
 in neighboring countries, began to return in large numbers. Under the auspices of
 the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHoR) and with the assist-
 ance of the International Organization of Migration, over 1.5 million refugees and
 most of the 3.6 million displaced persons had returned to their homes by year's end.
 At the end of 1994, there were few refugees from other countries, although 343
 asylum seekers were awaiting determination of their status. There were no reported
 cases in which refugees were forced to return to countries where they might have
 a well-founded fear of persecution.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 During 1994 the President, the FRELIMO leadership, and the Council of Min-
 isters continued to control pelicymaking and to influence implementation of the
 Rome Peace Accords. The 1992 Accords established a timetable for elections and an
 independent monitoring system to ensure their fairness. On October 27-29,
 Mozambicans freely exercised for the first time their right to vote in multiparty elec-
 tions. President Chissano and FRELIMO won the presidential and legislative elec-
 tions, gaining 53 percent of the presidential vote and 129 seats in the 250-seat Na-
 tional Assemnbly. RENAMO defeated FRELIMO in 5 of the county's 10 provinces,
 including in the 2 most populous provinces, Zambezia and Nampula. Dhlakama took
 33.7 percent of the vote, and RNaO won 112 legislative seats. A thirdparty coa-
 lition, the Democratic Union, won the remaining 9 seats. While RENAMO charged
 that the Government had engaged in ballot-riggng, Dhlakama accepted the out-
 come, and the U.N. and other observers declared the election results free and fair.
 While there are no legal restrictions hindering women's involvement in the politi-
 cal process, cultural factors have inhibited women's participation and advancement.
 At year's end, there was one female minister (for oarnation and Social Action)
 and four female vice ministers in the Government. The 21-member National Elec-
 tions Commission included 2 women to oversee the elections. Of the 250 newly elect-
 ed National Assembly deputies, 62 are women (48 of 129 for FRELIMO, 13 of 112
 for RENAMO, and 1 of 9  or the Democratic Union.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vest igation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 There ae no legal obstacles to the formation of local human rights groups, and
 two groups formed in 1993 continued to operate throughout the year. The
 Mozambican League for Human Rights focuses particularly on the rights of pris-
 oners. On at leastron occasion in 1994 it openly criticized the Government in the
 press for judicial delays affecting prisoners' rights.
 The Government was receptive to visits by international human rights monitoring
 groups, including the ICR  and Amnesty International.
 
 
 176
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution prohibits discrimination based on race, sex, religion, or disabil-
 ity, but the Government does not ensure in practice that citizens may exercise all
 these rights.
 Women.-Despite constitutional prohibition of discrimination based on sex, women
 suffer both legal and societal discrimination. Mozambique has civil and commercial
 legal codes wich predate independence and frequently contradict each other and
 the Constitution. Among these laws are discriminatory measures based on tradi-
 tional African practices Which limit widow's inheritance rights, with estates revert-
 ing to the deceased husband's relatives.
 Women continue to be under represented in the professions and have less access
 than males to educational institutions at all levels. Discrimination against women
 is most apparent in rural areas where over 80 percent of the population live, and
 where women are engaged mainly in subsistence farming and child-rearing, with lit-
 tle opportunity for schooling or access to health care.
 According to medical and other sources, violence against women, especially wife
 beating and rape, is fairly widespread in Mozambique, especially in rural areas. The
 plice d not normally intervene in domestic disputes and cases are rarely brought
 before the courts. The Government has not specificaly addressed the issue of vio-
 lence against women. While rape can theoretically be prosecuted in the courts, cul-
 tural pressures would make it difficult for most women to do so.
 The Justice Ministry and an NGO organization, the Association of Women, Law,
 and Development (MULEIDE), which aims to promote and defend the legal rights
 of women, are collaborating to identify those outdated laws that conflict with rights
 granted women by the 1990 Constitution. However, at year's end MULEIDE had
 not taken concrete action on the problems with the legal code. In addition to
 MULEmDE, a Zimbabwe-based group, Women in Law and Development in Africa,
 opened a Mozambique chapter in 1994 to focus on women's legal rig ts.
 Children.--The Government has not made children's rights and welfare a priority.
 It has made little attempt to reintegrate into society the arge numbers of child sol-
 diers that served in the military and RENAMO forces or alleviate the plight of the
 increasing numbers of urban street children, many of whom were orphaned by the
 war. During the year, RENAMO began allowing the ICRC and other NGO's greater
 access to children in its custody, some of whom had been forced to be soldiers. Of
 the 3,500 children who had been in RENAMO custody, approximately 500 had
 served as soldiers. At year's end, all but a minority of problem cases (where parents
 were no longer alive or could not take their children back) had been resolved, and
 the ICRC announced plans to close its operation.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-There is no systematic persecution *or dis-
 crimination on the basis of race, but the FRELIMO Government included at all lev-
 els a disproportionate number of southerners, mostly from the Shangaan ethnic
 group. RENAMO leadership is predominantly Shona-ethnic. There is no indication
 that the conflict between the FRELIMO Government and RENAMO was primarily
 motivated by ethnicity, although ethnic and regional factors played some role and
 explain some of the civil war violence.
 People With Disabilities.-Although the Constitution expressly states that "dis-
 abled citizens shall enjoy fully the rights enshrined in the Constitution," the Gov-
 ernment has made few resources available to assist the disabled and has not passed
 legislation mandating accessibility to public buildings or transportation. In 1991 the
 Association of Mozambican Disabled (ADEMO) was created to address the social and
 economic needs of the disabled. Although poorly funded, ADEMO provides training,
 raises public awareness of the need to integrate disabled persons into society, and
 lobbies the Ministry of Labor to initiate legislation to support the working rights
 of disabled persons. The Electoral Law governing the first multiparty elections spe-
 cifically addressed the needs of disabled voters in the polling booths by stipulating
 that sick or disabled persons could go to the front of the hne and be assisted by
 another voter to vote if necessary.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution specifies that all workers are free
 to join a trade union. A labor law passed in December 1991 further protects work-
 ers' rights to organize and to engage in union activity at their place of employment.
 The legislation gave existing unions the right to register independently from the
 then FRELIMO:dominated Organization of Mozambican Work ers (OTM). Three
 unions broke away from the OTM in 1992 and formed the Organization of Free and
 Independent Unions in 1994. While still considered to be under strong government
 influence, at its third National Congress in May the OTM membership for the first
 
 
 177
 time elected its President and Secretary General; previously both were government
 appointees. New OTM statutes call for independence from all influence by compa-
 mes, governments, political parties, and religious groups.
 The Constitution explicitly provides workers with the right to strike, with the ex-
 ception of government employees, police, militarypersonne, and employees of other
 essential services (which include sanitation, fireflghting, air traffic control, health
 care, water, electricity, fuel, post office, and telecommunications). While no general
 strikes occurred in 1994, there were numerous wildcat strikes, with workers protest-
 Slow or long overdue salaries. A downturn in Mozambique's industrial sector re-
 suited in many factory closures and employers unable to meet payrolls. Clashes be-
 tween protesting workers and polie sometimes turned violent, as in May in
 Nsmpula at the Modemo Wood Company, when police wounded several workers de-
 manding their unpaid wages.
 The 991 Labr Law forbid retribution against strikers, the hiring of substitute
 wor8ers, or lockouts by employers. There were no known instanes during 1994 of
 employer retribution against striking workers. Specific labor disputes are generally
 arbItratd through ad hoc workers' 0ommittees, formally recognized by the Govern-
 ment.
 The Constitution and labor legislation provide unions with the right to join and
 participate in international bodies. The OTM is a member of the Organization of Af-
 rican Trade Union Unity and the Southern African Trade Union Coordinating Coun-
 cil. In 1994 Parliament ratified four International Labor Organization (ILO) conven-
 tions, including those on collective bargaining and protection of trade union rights.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The Labor Law protects
 workers' rights to organize and engage in collective bargaining. In practice, the Gov-
 ernment dominates the industrial sector through state-owned enterprises and is
 deeply involved in the bargaining process, even though in late 1991, the Govern-
 ment decreed that it would no longer set all salary levels. During the year the OTM,
 the three independent unions, and business organizations met with the Government
 to negotiate a 'social pact," which resulted in an increased minimum wage and the
 setting of voluntary price ceilings on certain food staples. The more activist inde-
 pendent unions and, to a lesser extent the OTM, utilized the threat of a general
 strike to compel the Government and business organizations to establish a formal
 tripartite "social pact" committee to negotiate labor issues.
 The Labor Law expressly prohibits discrimination against organized labor, al-
 though antiunion discrimination has not been an issue since, until recently, unions
 were government-controlled organizations.
 While Mozambique has enacted legislation for the establishment of export proc-
 essing zones, no zones have been created.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The law prohibits forced or com-
 pulsory labor, and there have been no reports of such labor practices.
 d. Minimum Age For Employment of Children.-Child labor is regulated by the
 Ministry of Labor. In the wage economy, the minimum working age is 16. Because
 of high adult unemployment, few children are employed in regular wage positions.
 However, children commonly work on family farms or in the urban informal sector,
 where they perform such tasks as guarding cars, collecting scrap metal, or selling
 trinkets and food in the streets.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The Government sets minimum wage rates ad-
 ministratively. The minimum wage at year's end was less than $20 (117,500
 meticais) per month. The Ministry of Labor is responsible for enforcing the mini-
 mum rates in the private sector and the Ministry of Finance in the public sector.
 Violations of minimum wage rates are usually investigated only after workers reg-
 ister a complaint. It is customary for workers to receive fringe benefits such as
 transportation and food. The minimum wage is not considered sufficient to sustain
 an average urban worker's family. Many workers must turn to a second job, if avail-
 able, as well as work garden plots to survive.
 The standard legal workweek is 44 hours, with a 24-hour rest period stipulated.
 In the small industrial sector, the Government has enacted health and environ-
 mental laws to protect workers. On occasion, the Government has closed firms for
 noncompliance with these laws, but the Ministry of Labor enforces the laws ineffec-
 tively.
