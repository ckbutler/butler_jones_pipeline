 BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA
 Bosnia and Herzegovina, one of six constituent republics of the former Yugoslavia,
 became a sovereign state in April 1992 when 63 percent of its voters endorsed inde-
 pendence in a free and fair referendum. Pan-Serbian nationalists loyal to Serbian
 Democratic Party (SDS) leader Radovan Karadzic boycotted the referendum, and
 former Yugoslav National Army units which had organized themselves into a
 Bosnian Serb armed militia (BSA) declared their support for Karadzic. Backed by
 the Serbian authorities in Belgrade, the BSA began a brutal campaign of terror-
 in which acts of genocide took place-to establishan ethnically pure state linking
 Serb-occupied territory in Croatia with Serbia/Montenegro to form "greater Serbia."
 Human rights abuses in Bosnia occurred in an environment of war, occupation, a
 struggle for territory and power, the breakdown of a multiethnic system, and efforts
 to force the duly elected Bosnian Government to accept an ethnic division of the
 State. The Bosnian Government is Muslim-dominated but continues to support a
 multiethnic society, and elected officials are drawn proportionally from all national
 groups.
 Bosnia's population consisted of 4.4 million people before the war, 44 percent of
 whom were Muslim, 31 percent Serb, 17 percent Croat, and 8 percent other nation-
 alities. By October 1993, some 200,000 Bosnians were said to have died as a result
 of the conflict; over 800 000 became refugees outside Bosnia; and another 1.2 million
 were displaced within the nation.
 As BSA units swept through northern and eastern Bosnia in 1992, Karadzic de-
 clared the establishment of the "Republika Srpska" or "Serb Republic." Techniques
 employed by the BSA, which Serbs themselves referred to as "ethnic cleansing, in-
 cluded: layin4 siege to cities and indiscriminately shelling civilian inhabitants;
 "strangling" cities (i.e., withholding food deliveries and utilities so as to starve and
 freeze residents); executing noncombatants; establishing concentration camps where
 thousands of prisoners were summarily executed and tens of thousands subjected
 to torture and inhumane treatment; using prisoners as human shields; employing
 rape as a tool of war to terrorize and uproot populations; forcing large numbers of
 civilians to flee to other regions; razing villages to prevent the return of displaced
 persons; and interfering with international relief efforts, including attacks on relief
 personnel.
 In early 1993, the BSA, supported by paramilitary forces from Serbia and
 Montenegro, moved to complete ethnic cleansing campaigns in eastern Bosnia. The
 BSA virtually destroyed the hamlet of Cerska, chasing its residents into forests and
 minefields and subjected Srebrenica, Gorazde, and Zepa to strangulation and in-
 tense shelling. International protective forces which reached the enclaves in March
 described conditions as the worst they had ever seen and noted that there were vir-
 tually no residents left to help.
 By late spring, the BSA had consolidated most of its military and territorial gains
 in the east. Facing international pressure and tightened economic sanctions against
 Serbia/Montenegro, it scaled back assaults on the enclaves. But at midyear, the BSA
 renewed attacks on Sarajevo and tightened its grip on vital humanitarian supply
 lines, prompting a North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) threat of air strikes.
 This led to a reduction in shelling until December, when attacks again approached
 July levels. Ethnic cleansing campaigns in 1993 also took place in Banja luka and
 Bijeijina, and the BSA waged sporadic attacks on Tuzla, Doboj, Brcko, Olovo,
 Teocak, and Maglaj (this last town in conjunction with the Bosnian Croats) through
 December.
 In April periodic skirmishing between the Bosnian government army and the mili-
 tia of Mate Boban's Croatian Defense Council (HVO), the main representative of the
 Bosnian Croat minority, escalated into outright war. Regular Croatian army units,
 originally in Bosnia under a bilateral military cooperation pact, fought on the side
 of Boban's forces; Croatian authorities also offered materiel to the HVO but signifi-
 cantly less than that which Serbian authorities provided to the BSA.
 The trigger for the surge in government-HVO fighting was Boban's insistence on
 the creation of a separate Bosnian Croat "Republic of Herceg-Bosna" within Bosnia
 and Herzegovina. Mostar was to be its capital, and government troops in the region
 were told to submit to HVO command. When the Government refused, the HVO
 blockaded Mostar, attacked it, and brutalized, confined, and raped its Muslim resi-
 dents in an assault containing some of Lhe most extreme human rights abuses in
 Bosnia and Herzegovina in 1993.
 The HVO also engaged in vicious acts in central Bosnia. In April the HVO killed
 up to 100 noncombatants in the central Bosnian hamlet of Ahmici and then razed
 the village. In October it massacred at least, a score of Muslim civilians at Stupni
 
 
 807
 Dol. The HVO and BSA engaged in localized collaboration on the battlefield in the
 central Bosnian enclave of Maglaj, creating conditions of extreme deprivation there.
 Bosnian government forces perpetrated a number of abuses and atrocities in 1993,
 for the most part against the Bosnian Creats. In September government troops
 killed dozens of Croat civilians at Uzdol; the HVO charged that many more govern-
 ment massacres not yet investigated occurred in central Bosnia. As the tide in the
 fighting turned in favor of the Government in the fall, tens of thousands of Bosnian
 Creats fled or were driven from their homes, most going either to Croatia or to parts
 of Bosnia under HVO control. In November government forces killed two Franciscan
 friars in Fojnica and openly looted Bosnian Croat-owned shops in Vares.
 In 1993 as in 1992, all national groups were victimized by the conflict, and all
 sides violated the Geneva conventions. But the BSA, with Belgrade's complicity,
 launched the Bosnian conflict through its aggressive ethnic cleansing campaign. Its
 pursuit of a policy of dispersiny and destroying populations based on religious and
 national affiliation created a climate of prejudice and fear that ultranationalists on
 all sides subsequently exploited.
 International efforts to stop the conflict were not successful by year's end. At best,
 international attention diminished the level of fighting for short periods of time. The
 participants to the conflict negotiated and signed numerous cease-fires but did not
 adhere to them. Bosnian Serb ethnic cleansing campaigns in eastern enclaves in the
 spring occurred even as Karadzic and Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic nego-
 tiated aspects of a settlement plan. Bosnian Croat atrocities in the spring, summer,
 and fall took place in spite of Boban's formal acceptance of several internationally
 sponsored peace initiatives. Bosnian government offensives against Bosnian Croat
 enclaves in central Bosnia late in the year occurred during sessions of the Geneva
 negotiations. Resolutions adopted by the United Nations Security Council failed to
 have a significant impact on the human rights situation or the war itself. U.N.-de-
 ployed peacekeepers (UNPROFOR)-some units of which were being investigated
 for abuses, corruption and partiality-were not equipped for peacemaking and found
 that there was no peace to keep.
 The U.N.'s Commission of Experts established by a Security Council resolution
 in October 1992 to investigate possible war crimes, continued to study abuses of
 human rights in Bosnia, Serbia, and Croatia. The War Crimes Tribunal was created
 by a subsequent resolution in February to assess the culpability of alleged perpetra-
 tors of atrocities and issue a comprehensive report on violations of human rights
 and humanitarian law. At year's end, all judges had been sworn in and a chief pros-
 ecutor named. Between September 1992 and June 1993, the United States Govern-
 ment submitted eight separate reports to the War Crimes Commission summarizing
 thousands of instances of killings, torture, rape, interference with humanitarian de-
 liveries, mass deportations, and other violations of humanitarian law. In addition,
 the United States provided the United Nations with 400 refugee reports totaling
 over 1,000 pages. Illustrative examples from these submissions appear in sections
 of the report below.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-In the circumstances of the Bosnian
 war, targeted killings were difficult to distinguish from killings resulting from indis-
 criminate attacks and unpremeditated actions. (See Section 1.g. for a description of
 large-scale, war-related atrocities committed against civilians, including killings.)
 While only the pro-Karadzic Bosnian Serbs pursued ethnic cleansing as a matter of
 broad policy, local units of HVO soldiers and Bosnian government troops, as well
 as Serbian and Montenegrin paramilitaries and civilian gangs and mobs, killed
 many people out of nationalistic or religious hatred. The United Nations confirmed
 the existence of dozens of mass grave sites, as yet unexhumed. The Bosnian Govern-
 ment, HVO and Bosnian Serbs alleged that there were many more.
 During ethnic cleansing campaigns in the early part of 1993, the BSA targeted
 local civic and religious leaders with the goal of figuratively decapitating Muslim so-
 ciety. Among the prominent individuals assassinated for political reasons was
 Bosnian Deputy Prime Minister Hakija Turajlic, who was shot at point-blank range
 by Bosnian Serb soldiers in January while riding in a U.N. vehicle that had been
 stopped-against U.N. procedures-at a roadblock.
 At least 10 international relief workers died in 1993, shot by BSA or HVO soldiers
 or snipers of unknown affiliation. Sixty-some UNPROFOR soldiers died in outright
 attacks or as a result of sniper fire, and 34 journalists were killed (10 in 1993) since
 the beginning of the conflict. The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR)
 
 
 and some international relief agencies suspended operations on several occasions
 during 1993 because of danger to personnel.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reliable figures for the numbers of missing per-
 sons, but with hundreds of thousands dead, thousands incarcerated, and over 2 mil-
 lion having fled their homes, many more were missing. The Bosnian Government
 claimed that 26,000 Bosnians were missing as of May. Two international journalists
 were known to be missing.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 In spite of intense international pressure to close the prison camps discovered under
 BSA control in mid-1992, there were probably still scores of detention facilities for
 civilians, including women, children, and the elderly, in operation throughout
 Bosnia at the end of 1993. As many as 260 camps have been known to exist at one
 time or another during the conflict. In January 1993, the U.S. Government esti-
 mated that there were 135 Serb-run detention centers in Bosnia. Many of these
 formed part of the penal system established in BSA-held areas in mid-1992; a sig-
 nificant number in this network were closed by the end of 1993. Many VO and
 Muslim camps, numerous in the summer and fall of 1993, were also closed by the
 end of the year.
 Because camps closed down and reopened depending in part on the status of nego-
 tiations and the presence of international observers, it was difficult to estimate the
 nuwbers of persons detained. The three sides defined all males between 16 and 65
 as combatants, so some civilian detainees were listed as prisoners of war. In October
 the UNHCR reported that the HVO was holding 4,200 Muslims and Roma in reg-
 istered centers, down from the summer's high of 15,000 (many of whom were Mus-
 lim soldiers formerly in the HVO.) According to the UNHCR, the government held
 1,100 detainees in registered centers as of October. The BSA was believed to be
 holding 550 Muslims and Croats in registered camps as of October significantly less
 than the number of those incarcerated in 1992. Far more were held in unregistered
 centers. Observers stated throughout the year that the three sides hid prisoners and
 criticized the HVO's refusal in mid-1993 to allow international officials to visit
 camps around Mostar, where numerous refugees reported conditions to be dreadful.
 Camps with %or living conditions in 1993 included those in Batkovici, Kamenica,
 Trnopolje, and Doboj (operated by the BSA); Rodoc, Otok, and Dretel (operated by
 the HVO); and Zenica and Konjic (operated by the Government). At Dretelb, perhaps
 the most notorious camp of 1993, the UNHCR found prisoners in conditions of "ap-
 palling brutality and degradation," with broken ribs and fingers, bruises, and heart
 irregularities. Amnesty International said prisoners at Dretelj were so cramped that
 they could not lie down. Beatings and torture were reported at BSA camps in
 Manjaca, Batkovici, and Prijedor in the spring, at HVO camps in Rodoc and
 Jablanica in the summer, and at government camps in Visoko and Konjic, also in
 summer. Summary executions and deaths due to torture or neglect were attested
 to in 1993 and almost certainly continued through December.
 Individuals detained in 1993 told of meager and sometimes poisoned or spoiled
 rations, malnutrition, poor or nonexistent sanitation, withholding of medical care,
 forced labor (performed by women as well as men) including trench-digging on the
 front lines and removal of corpses and the wounded, forced blood donations, over-
 crowding, and lack of amenities such as bedding. There were scattered reports of
 groups of prisoners being conscripted into enemy armies and of prisoners of one na-
 tionality being sold as conscripts from the second to the third nationality. The three
 sides were accused of using prisoners as human shields. In June the BSA arrested
 non-Serbs in Doboj and forced them to stand as a living front line in combat areas
 nearby.
 Bosnian Muslim women in the spring and summer accused HVO and BSA sol-
 diers of perpetrating mass rape. The UNHCR noted that HVO soldiers may have
 raped 100 or more women, some in gang-rape situations; many of the rapes occurred
 in connection with evictions from Mostar in mid-1993 and fighting near Vitez ear-
 lier in the year. Reports of rapes by Bosnian Serb civil and military police and sol-
 diers continued, but the number of such charges was lower for 1993 than for 1992,
 when the BSA first practiced mass rape as a tool of war. Reports from Brcko, Nerici,
 Stolina, Skijana, and Grcica described the continuing confinement and sexual abuse
 of a total of at least 130 young Muslim women by the BSA. UNPROFOR troops
 were accused of frequenting some locations where Muslim women were held.
 Bosnian Croat women charged government troops with raping them in Mostar and
 Bugojno; the Bosnian Serbs also said government soldiers had raped Bosnian Serb
 women. International observers were not able to corroborate most accusations be-
 cause access to victims was very limited.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The BSA continued to round up members
 of the intelligentsia and target regional and local political, economic, and religious
 
 
 809
 figures in an effort to destroy the social structure of other nationality groups.
 Sarajevo's Roman Catholic Archbishop, Monsignor Vinko Puljic, was ab ucted by
 the BSA and held temporarily along with his UNPROFOR guards in November.
 Ransom was sometimes an additional motive for arbitrary arrest and detention.
 BSA and HVO troops abducted government bodyguards of international officials
 from UNPROFOR vehicles on several occasions and held UNPROFOR soldiers hos-
 tage for brief periods.
 In addition to the large number of civilians detained in prison camps (see Section
 1.c.), some civilians were detained for prisoner exchanges. Families of military offi-
 cers were abducted with regularity because they had a high exchange value. In
 Vitez in April, both the HVO and the government forces arrested large numbers of
 civilians for use in future exchanges. The residents of some entire villages were pre-
 vented from leaving municipal confines (see Section 2. d.) so they could be used in
 prisoner exchanges. The Serbs detained Muslims, Croats, and Roma for use as un-
 paid labor in combat zones (see Section 6.c.).
 While the Bosnian Government did not practice exile per se detainees released
 by the Government, as well as those released by the BSA and HVO, were sometimes
 forced over the border (see Section 1.g.). Ethnic cleansing and mass population
 movements before advancing troops resulted in forced dislocation that was equiva-
 lent to exile for the half of Bosnia's prewar population that at the end of the year
 was seeking refuge abroad or protection elsewhere within Bosnia.
 e. DeniLof Fair Public Trial.-In areas under its control, the Bosnian govern-
 ment attempted to maintain a functioning judicial system. International legal ex-
 perts have said the March trial for war crimes of two Bosnian Serb soldiers who
 had confessed to mass killings and mass rape at the behest of commanding officers
 was fair.
 Summary trials and executions of local warlords who served as irregular govern-
 ment army commanders took place in Sarajevo in October, during a government
 crackdown on rogue elements in the military. The individuals who were tried and
 executed had been identified as responsible for seizing UNPROFOR vehicles and
 controlling extensive black market activities.
 Near the front lines and in BSA and HVO-controlled areas, military authorities
 who held power did not guarantee the legal rights of non-Serbs and non-Croats, re-
 spectively.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-Vir-
 tually all officials of the three sides (and international observers as well) assumed
 they were subjected to systematic surveillance. Most were unwilling to use tele-
 phones or the mail system, to the extent that they functioned, for any but the most
 routine business. Citizens who were interrogated reported that their questioners did
 not conceal the practice of surveillance.
 g. Use of Excessive Force and Violations of Humanitarian Law in Internal Con-
 flicts.-Violations of humanitarian law and international conventions on the treat-
 ment of civilians in time of war were widespread and egregious. Many human rights
 violations committed by the BSA occurred as part of specific policies to expel Mus-
 lims and Croats from areas the Serbs desired for themselves. The HVO engaged in
 localized efforts to drive Muslims away from territories they sought to occupy. Other
 abuses took place on a more haphazard basis. Paramilitaries, vigilantes, weekend
 warriors," criminal gangs reporting to local warlords, and civilian mobs were respon-
 sible for numerous instances of crimes against civilians. Atrocities detailed in this
 section include indiscriminate attacks against civilians; forced population move-
 ments; interference with the delivery of humanitarian relief, including attacks on
 international relief workers; interference with utilities and infrastructure; and
 forced conscriptions. Mistreatment of prisoners of war resembled mistreatment of ci-
 vilian detainees and is handled in Section 1.c. Use of prisoners as human shields
 is also treated in Section 1.c. (See the Country Report on Serbia/Montenegro for in-
 formation on Bosnian Serb paramilitaries who crossed the border into Serbia to at-
 tack Sandzak Muslims.)
 The BSA's relentless military assault on the eastern enclaves in early 1993, its
 periodic attacks on Sarajevo, and ethnic cleansing campaigns in Bana Luka,
 Bijeljina, and towns in north-central Bosnia throughout the year resulted in tens
 of thousands of civilian deaths. U.N. observers reported that mass killings of civil-
 ians and attacks on refugees trying to flee Srebrenica, Gorazde, and Zepa were com-
 monplace. UNPROFOR claimed the BSA was attacking and seizing one or two Mus-
 lim villages a day in the eastern region throughout March. In April and May, con-
 cern over conditions in besieged enclaves prompted the passage of U.N. resolutions
 that declared Srebrenica and subsequently Gorazde, Zepa, Sarajevo, Tuzla, and
 Bihac "safe areas" where security and relief deliveries were to have been guaran-
 teed. Heavy BSA attacks on the safe areas continued through June, and more spo-
 
 
 810
 radic attacks occurred during the rest of the year. By the summer, most of Gorazde
 and surrounding hamlets had been leveled. Many villages outside Srebrenica were
 completely destroyed, as were some villages in the vicinity of Zepa.
 In Banja Luka, the BSA killed and mutilated Muslim and Croat civilians as part
 of ethnic cleansing campaigns throughout the year. When a group of Muslims under
 attack sought protection in a local mosque in February, the BSA attacked the
 mosque. BSA advances also destroyed much of Maglaj and Doboj and many smaller
 communities near Brcko. Several civilians in Maglaj were killed while attempting
 to retrieve airdropediarcels, their only source of food in the latter half of the year.
 BSA killings of inviduals in central Bosnia, as in the eastern enclaves and Banja
 Luka, sometimes involved mutilations.
 Sarajevo was under heavy BSA pressure throughout the year. Thirty civilians, in-
 cluding a leading physician delivering baby food, were killed in the first 10 days of
 Decenber. In November, 9 children were killed and 20 injured by an BSA shell that
 fell on a school. As in the eastern enclaves, the BSA deliberately aimed shells at
 hospitals, mosques, markets, cemeteries, and residential areas.
 HVO attacks, particularly on Muslims, increased dramatically in 1993. The HVO
 slaughtered approximately 100 Muslims in the central Bosnian village of Ahmici in
 April Masked Croats killed Muslim civilians in Vitez in house-to-house fighting
 later that month. In September the United Nations said HVO shelling killedl 10 to
 15 Muslims a day in Mostar. The HVO in the spring also reportedly shot two Serb
 women who were p art of a small contingent of Serb inhabitants of Mostar forced
 out of the city an told to walk to BSA-held positions. In October between 25 and
 50 Muslim villagers, including women and children, were killed by the HVO at
 Stupni Dol near Vares; the remainder of the town's population was taken captive
 and the viliage entirely destroyed. The HVO shelled  NCR officials attempting to
 gain access to Stupni Dol for 3 days before finally letting medical examiners
 through. Later in the month, the Bosnian Government claimed the discovery of a
 mass grave in Tasovcici containing the bodies of alleged victims of HVO attacks in
 Stolac and Capbina.
 Government troops also targeted civilians in 1993, particularly Bosnian Croats.
 Thirty Bosnian Croat civilians were massacred at Uzdo] in September. Survivors of
 the attack said they were used as human shields. Government soldiers murdered
 two Franciscan friars in Fojnica in November. The HVO charged the Government
 with killing more than 100 other Bosnian Croat civilians between April and October
 in a variety of central Bosnian locations including Trusina, Doljani Bugojno,
 Jakovice, Kisebak, and Kopijari. Witnesses described torture preceding tie killings
 and mutilation afterward. The United Nations is investigating the charges. Govern-
 ment soldiers killed a score of Bosnian Serb civilians in the village of Skelani, in
 the Srebrenica pocket, in January, and shot several Bosnian Serbs in Sarajevo, in-
 cluding two elderly people being evacuated.
 The Bosnian conflict has brutally uprooted millions of civilians. The residents of
 Cerska and the populations of several villages in its vicinity were driven out of their
 homes as part of the BSA's ethnic cleansing campaigns in eastern Bosnia in early
 1993. The BSA then plundered and burned or shelled virtually all houses. Large
 segments of the populations of other eastern enclaves also fled the BSA in the
 spring, some across mined territory. Many refugees from the BSA went to Tuzla (be-
 hind the front lines,) the population of which increased four-fold in the spring.
 World Health Organization (WHO) officials in the city termed conditions "desperate"
 because the limited infrastructure could not handle the huge refugee population.
 Bosnian Serbs pursuing cleansing operations in southern Herzegovina ordered
 residents of Trebinje and Bileca to leave the district in January, killed several who
 did not comply, and bombed mosques. Over 1,000 Muslims fled to Montenegro. In
 an effort to frighten non-Serbs into leaving Banja Luka, BSA soldiers cut phone
 lines, beat residents, sealed off and bombed non-Serb shops, seized non-Serb a part-
 ments, fire-bombed mosques, threatened citizens with rape, and warned non-Serbs
 via the local television station they would have to pay heavy fines for remaining.
 (As noted above, they also killed and mutilated non-Serb residents of Banja Luka.)
 Some non-Serbs in Bijeina were reportedly forced to give up house keys and prop-
 erty deeds before being driven to front lines and ordered to walk across them. In
 August a group of Muslims from Bijeljina was driven through Serbia proper to the
 Hungarian border, where they were dumped. Cleansing operations in central Bosnia
 continued. Of 43,000 Muslims recorded as living in Doboj in the 1991 census, only
 1,000 remained in November 1993 according to the United Nations.
 HVO troops worked most activefy around Mostar to force non-Croats to move out.
 In May the HVO rounded up thousands of Muslims and imprisoned them tempo-
 rarily in the heliodrome stadium while simultaneously running thousands more out
 of town. When several made their way back, they found former Muslim areas empty
 
 
 811
 and buildings shot full of holes. In June the HVO burned the personal papers, in-
 cluding apartment leases, of Muslims who had not so far been detained or chased
 out and forced them across a bridge under a hail of gunfire to a section of east
 Mostar where they were ghettoized. 13y the end of June, international relief agencies
 said the HVO had destroyed virtually all Muslim property in Mostar. In July a
 number of the ghettoized Muslims in Mostar were boarded onto buses and dumped
 in Croatia against their will. In September the UNHCR described signs of malnutri-
 tion and physical abuse among the 14,000 Muslims who had escaped Mostar and
 surrounding towns and made it to Jablanica, behind the front lines in central
 Bosnia.
 The HVO chased Muslims out of several central Bosnian locations in early 1993,
 including an Italian-run refugee camp whose staff and inhabitants were forced to
 flee; local HVO commanders said they planned to expel more Muslims from the re-
 gion to make room for Bosnian Croats who were homeless as a result of govern-
 ment-HVO fighting. At midyear, the HVO began evicting Muslims from Stolac,
 Capl4ina, and-Livno, forcing as many as 20,000 across the front lines. Before the
 evictions began, local HVO officials disconnected Muslims' telephones, requisitioned
 their cars, and made radio broadcasts saying their security could not be guaranteed.
 Tens of thousands of Bosnian Croat refugees fled Konjic, Travnik, Novi Travnik,
 and Vitez in fear of advancing government troops in the spring. In September gov-
 ernment forces used death threats and extortion to pressure Bosnian Croats to leave
 Zenica; a month later government soldiers rounded up 1,000 Bosnian Croat refugees
 trying to flee Konjic, robbed them, beat them, and fired shots at them. In November
 the UNHCR described the situation around Vares as "chaotic," with gunmen terror-
 izing 15 000 mostly Bosnian Croat civilians who had fled their homes in fear of at-
 tack. Boban claimed 150,000 to 190,000 Bosnian Croats had been displaced by fight-
 ing in central Bosnia or driven out by the Government as of late fall.
 All parties to the conflict interfered with humanitarian assistance, but abuses by
 the BSA were most widespread in 1993. In February BSA troops issued orders for-
 mally sealing off Bihac, Zepa, Gorazde, and Srebrenica from relief deliveries, which
 in any case had not occurred for many months. In Zepa, Cerska, Srebrenica,
 Konjevic Poe, Kamenica, and Gorazde, deaths due to a combination of severe mal-
 nutrition, exposure, and wounds that could not be treated for lack of medicine oc-
 curred in the winter and spring. WHO doctors said 20 to 30 people died of untreated
 wounds, lack of food, an exposure every day in Srebrenica during the month of
 March. When observers reached Zepa at the end of January, they found the popu-
 lation eating bread made of straw. After seizing 14 villages near Cerska in March,
 the BSA blocked international evacuation of the wounded, resulting in more deaths.
 The BSA then shelled UNPROFOR troops attempting to carry a field hospital into
 Srebrenica and threatened to fire on German relief planes if Germany participated
 in the relief effort. The WHO reported that tuberculosis and hepatitis were increas-
 ing sharply among the refugee population of Tuzla as the "pharmaceutical situation
 collapsed.nIn April the BSA blocked convoys bound for Gorazde, where starvation
 was reportedly imminent, as the ICRC announced from Zagreb it was considering
 withdrawing from Bosnia because of BSA harassment. In June BSA positions
 shelled a UNHCR convoy near Maglaj, killing three relief workers.
 Throughout the remainder of the year, more relief workers were killed, more citi-
 zens die dof dep rivation, and more vitally import medical evacuations failed to take
 p lace both inside and outside the United Nations' safe zones due to BSA threats and
 harassment. U.N. Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali, on a trip to the safe
 areas shortly after they were declared, described conditions brought about by long-
 term BSA denial of relief as dappalling.
 TheVObegan closingroadsleadng to Muslim areas of central Bosnia to all
 commercial traffic in February. In April the HVO scized and briefly held several
 international relief workers near Kiseak, claiming they had sided with the Govern-
 ment. In May the HVO began blocking all relief convoys bound for Mostar; as a re-
 sult, almost none reached the city until late August. Participants in an HVO attack
 on a U.N. convoy in central Bosnia in mid-1993 said they were acting under orders
 to threaten Erean Community (EC) and U.N. officials. In July the HVO began
 charging tol thermed extortionate" by relief workers. In August the UNHCR tem-
 porarily suspended relief deliveries to central Bosnia because its convoys were being
 harassed by the HVO. International relief agencies reported that the HVO had tar-
 aeted its ore s for harassment a nd anbuse, bound and gagged UNHCR employees
 iMostar, and fired a grenade (which did not explode) at an ICRC truck. In Novem-
 ber an HVO commander accused of leading the attack on Stupni Dol ordered all
 U.N. relief workers to depart Kiswak. Later in the month, a combination of mal-
 nutrition and exposure brought about by HVO interference with relief resulted in
 several deaths in Mostar.
 
 
 812
 In February the Bosnian Government responded to the BSA's order to seal off the
 eastern enclaves and Bihac from relief by refusing relief deliveries to Sarajevo.
 Frustrated at the politicization of humanitarian assistance, the UNHCR temporarily
 suspended aid to many parts of Bosnia. In March local officials in Srebrenica de-
 tained UNPROFOR General Phillie Morillon as a shield against further BSA shell-
 ing. (Morillon subsequently elected to remain as a gesture of solidarity with the peo-
 plie of the enclave.) In Sarajevo the Government refused the delivery of fuel bound
 or Bosnian Serb hospitals. In Mostar local government officials detained the first
 convoy to arrive in the city in 3 months and a UNPROFOR contingent as well, ap-
 parently in the hope that keeping them in Mostar would prevent the HVO from re-
 newing its attacks on the city. In the fall, government soldiers attacked a UNHCR
 convoy near Novi Travnik and killed the driver; they subsequently shot and wound-
 ed a U.N. driver in Kakani after his convoy refused to hand over fuel. In December
 overnment soldiers attacked a Croatian convoy attempting to deliver relief to
 osnian Croats in Nova Bila.
 At the end of 1993, UNPROFOR forces were under investigation for showing fa-
 voritism in the provision of humanitarian assistance. At year's end, the United Na-
 tions was investigating reports that some UNPROFOR units attempted to influence
 the outcome of the conflict through preferential deliveries of aid.
 The BSA interfered with utilities and infrastructure to a much greater extent
 than the HVO or Government. The WHO, terming the situation in Sarajevo "des-
 perate" in January, said several elderly residents of nursing homes had frozen to
 death due to Bosnian Serb diversions of natural gas to the capital. The BSA cut the
 water supply to Srebrenica in April and prevented U.N. workers from repairing it.
 In Jul a .S. Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance relief team visiting Sarajevo re-
 ported that most houses lacked electricity and as; water was generally unpotable,
 and dysentery was spreading. The        no   in July that Gorazde's water sup-
 ply was contaminated with human waste as a result of BSA interference. In Octo-
 er, 0 days after the announcement that the BSA had achieved its aims and ended
 the siege of Sarajevo, heavy shelling resumed, and gas supplies were reduced. The
 WHO reported an increase in burns as residents used more "do-it-yourself' heating
 contraptions in an effort to keep warm. In November the UNHCR said some pa-
 tients had died in hospitals that remained unheated due to the BSA cut-off of gas
 and cold had made some patients too weak to withstand operations. As of the end
 of the year, Sarajevo was under the heaviest mortar fire since before NATO's Au-
 gust warning, and water, electricity, and gas flows remained sporadic and at barely
 usable levels.
 The HVO prevented international relief workers from supplying water pumps and
 water-purifying equipment to Mostar in the summer. In November the HVO de-
 stroyed Mostar's 400-year-old UNESCO-protected Ottoman Foot Bridge, which sup-
 plied the Muslim ghetto in the eastern sector with water. A Belgrade architect noted
 that the bridge had "linked cultures and people" and remarked that, "with a loss
 like this, people lose their place in time." No instances of government interference
 with utilities and infrastructure have come to light, but government forces near
 Mostar in August did threaten to release the floodgates on the Neretva River to
 drive the HVO out of the area.
 The three sides practiced forced conscriptions to a limited degree in 1993. In some
 BSA-held areas, those who refused the draft were dismissed from work and de-
 tained. Some families of men who refused conscription were also dismissed. In April
 the BSA forced evacuation flights from Srebrenica to divert to BSA-held Zvornik,
 where evacuees were taken prisoner and threatened with conscription. The HVO
 segregated Bosnian Croat males from among displaced persons on the run near
 Stolac and Capijina and forced them to enlist in the HVO in October. There was
 no right to conscientious objection under Bosnian law; Serbs and Croats who refused
 the draft in Banovici were arrested by local officials, conscripted into the govern-
 ment army, and taken to the front lines in the spring. Also in the spring, the Gov-
 ernment prevented draft-age men from leaving Zepa and Sarajevo.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-Bosnian Serb refugees complained of living in
 a virtual police state under Karadzic's SDS. They suffered harassment, dismissal,
 and incarceration at the hands of BSA soldiers and pro-Karadzic local officials for
 taking a public stance in support of the Bosnian government or for oppsing the ide-
 ology of the SDS. A BSA military court sentenceda Bosnian Serb worker to a prison
 term this summer for trying to broker cease-fire talks between the Government and
 BSA. A Bosnian Croat family living near the BSA detention facility in Trnopolje was
 shot because they "looked at the camp" too frequently, and officials feared they
 
 
 813
 might talk about it. In 1993 as well as 1992, numerous Bosnian Serbs were killed
 by BSA soldiers for speaking up in defense of Bosnian Muslim neighbors.
 Freedom of speech and debate was protected as a matter of principle in Bosnian
 schools, but due to security concerns educational institutions were open only spo-
 radically, sometimes in unusual settings such as underground bunkers. In a move
 that denied freedom of thought and expression to all Bosnians, the BSA fire-bombed
 the national library in Sarajevo, destroying major collections of cultural importance
 to all nationalities.
 Before the war, the principal Bosnian media--Sarajevo radio and television, the
 Sarajevo daily Oslobodjenje, the independent television station Yutel-were widely
 regarded as accurate and balanced. Olsobodjenje, with a multiethnic staff, has main-
 tained standards of objectivity and accuracy that won international prizes and ac-
 claim even under the difficult circumstances of the war. The newspaper endorsed
 the notion of a pluralistic Bosnia and supported democratic and progressive ele-
 ments in the Government. Editorials freely criticized government policies and offi-
 cials. Sarajevo also had a tabloid press that the Government tolerated, but authori-
 ties detained several reporters from Tanjug, the Belgrade-based news service, and
 denied visas to Radio Zagreb personnel.
 The single television station operating in Sarajevo in 1993, funded by the Govern-
 ment, took a pro-government line. The Government also ran a radio station and al-
 lowed an independent station to broadcast. The government news agency, BH Press,
 emphasized reports of attacks against Muslims and downplayed reports of atrocities
 committed by government forces.
 The SDS news agency SRNA, headquartered in Pale, provided biased and dis-
 torted reporting. Both SRNA and Tanjug, the Serbian news service, carried unsub-
 stantiated reports of crimes against Serbs in order to reinforce ethnic Serb solidar-
 ity, promote ethnic hatred, and instigate violence. A pro-Karadzic television station
 that broadcast from Bahia Luka transmitted reports directly from Serbia and re-
 ceived financial support from Belgrade Television. As noted in Section 1.g., in Feb-
 ruary it advised Muslims and Croats to leave Banja Luka or pay fines for remain-
 in $he HVO's newly established news agency, HABENA, reported Bosnian Croat
 casualty figures far in excess of those attested to by international relief organiza-
 tions. Radio Zagreb regularly issued distorted reports. For example, in November it
 reported that Swedish peacekeepers detained by the HVO had been helping Mus-
 lims when in fact they were attempting to escort Bosnian Croat civilian refugees
 near Vares to safety.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The right of peaceful assembly
 and association could not be observed in the conditions of war and violence. In areas
 not under the control of the Government, assemblies of persons whose nationality
 and religion were not the same as those in power were regarded with suspicion and
 in some cases participants were subjected to harassment and attack. Even in gov-
 ernment-controlled areas, large gatherings such as queues often attracted snipers.
 c. Freedom of Religion. -Religious tolerance has been a tradition of the diverse
 Bosnian population for 500 years. Serbian Orthodox Bosnian Serbs, Roman Catholic
 Bosnian Croats, and Muslim Bosnians are largely indistinguishable in terms of lan-
 guage and physical appearance. But the war and ongoing atrocities radicalized
 many, and religion became one of the justifications for fighting. Citizens living in
 government-controlled areas enjoyed the greatest freedom of religion in 1993, as the
 Government remained committed to pluralism and included representatives of all
 religious groups.
 In connection with ethnic cleansing campaigns, BSA troops systematically de-
 stroyed religious institutions and made cultural monuments specific targets. In
 areas under BSA control, virtually all mosques and Roman Catholic churches have
 been bombed, shelled, burned, or bulldozed, and statuary has been defaced. The
 BSA destroyed the last of Trebinje's mosques in April, after expelling the majority
 of the towns Muslims. Banja Luka's historic 16th century mosques were also demol-
 ished, as were all the mosques in Bijeljina.
 The HVO destroyed mosques as well, including four in Stolac and one in Pocitelj
 this summer. The HVO charged the BSA and the Government with the destruction
 of 66 churches in the course of the conflict. All told, hundreds of mosques and
 churches have been demolished, including several of unique architectural and cul-
 tural significance, since the war began.
 Mixed marriages accounted for 20 to 30 percent of unions before the war began;
 citizens in mixed marriages faced difficult choices as the war expanded. In some
 cases, they hid their religious backgrounds or sought shelter with those of a dif-
 ferent faith to avoid being separated from their families. In government-held areas,
 
 
 814
 where commitment to religious diversity was a matter of law, individuals in mixed
 marriages had an easier time than those in BSA- or HVO-controlled areas.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The wartime situation, coupled with mass detention and expulsion (dis-
 cussed in Sections 1.d. and 1.g above), interfered with the free movement of millions
 of Bosnians. The changing front lines made many others virtual hostages within
 broad geographic areas. Sarajevo was the most heavily populated island of "hos-
 tages" in Bosnia. The lack of safe transportation into or out of the capital put citi-
 zens and officials at risk when they attempted to travel to other parts of the country
 or abroad. The airport was one of the most frequently attacked targets in the city.
 In some cases citizens of whole villages were given orders to remain within speci-
 fied confines, or be shot or fined, in order that a pool of people to perform labor and
 take part in prisoner exchanges could be maintained. In some areas, the BSA estab-
 lished local "Commissions for Exchange" to ensure that non-Serbs wishing to leave
 were exchanged for Serbs who wished to return. In March the BSA put in place pro-
 cedures whereby non-Serbs wishing to go to other regions were not permitted to
 carry valuables or travel by car; non-Serbs were also required to pay higher prices
 for bus tickets and exorbitant transit taxes in BSA-controlled towns they crossed.
 The Government inhibited movement by citizens in part to avoid a mass exodus.
 During the BSA sieges against the eastern enclaves in the spring, local officials
 sometimes prevented UNPROFOR from leaving areas under attack. The Govern-
 ment prevented large numbers of Bosnian Croats from leaving Bugojno and
 Banovici during the summer, using the civilians in prisoner exchanges and as forced
 labor. Local authorities announced in September that Zenica's 23,000 Bosnian
 Crats could not leave the city. (Earlier in the month, government soldiers had pres-
 sured them to depart against their will.) In Sarajevo the city's Secretariat of Evacu-
 ations often refused Bosnian Serbs permission to leave or delayed their departure
 for many months.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The duly elected Bosnian Government did not have the means to protect its terri-
 tory, to defend its sovereignty, or to guarantee its citizens' rights. Nearly 80 percent
 of the country was under the military control of various separatists su pported by
 Serbia or Croatia. In this environment, the Bosnian Government's goal of establish-
 ing a secular, pluralistic, democratic society in an undivided land had little chance
 of success. Bosnia's only election, which occurred in April 1992, created a bicameral
 National Assembly with 240 seats, of which 99 were filled by Muslims, 84 by
 Bosnian Serbs, 50 by Bosnian Croats, and 7 by others, in proportion to the composi-
 tion of the population of the country at the time. There were no elections scheduled
 for 1993.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The Bosnian Government, the BSA, and the HVO all agreed in principle to allow
 international observers access to territory under their control so alleged human
 rights abuses could be investigated. In practice, political and military authorities
 imposed obstacles and made it difficult for international officials to carry out inves-
 tigations.
 All sides in the war viewed the work of international organizations through the
 prism of their political interests. All sides downplayed their own culpability for
 atrocities. Both the BSA and HVO denied responsibility for human rights abuses
 that international investigators assigned to them, claiming for example that the
 Government was killing its own civilians in the hope of blaming the other side for
 atrocities. No side has cooperated fully on the issue of examination of prisoners.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 Women.-In addition to being subjected to rape (Section 1.c.), women suffered
 other sorts of physical abuse in 1993. Muslim women in Mostar reported they were
 strip-searched (and in some cases raped) by male HVO soldiers before being evicted
 from the city. Before the war, discrimination against women was not officially prac-
 ticed, although there were few women in prominent positions.
 Children.-The United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) reported in June that
 1,400 children had been killed and 12,800 wounded since the beginning of the con-
 flict; 91 percent had witnessed shooting in the course of the conflict, 72 percent had
 had their homes shelled, 41 percent had witnessed a person being injured or killed,
 and 81 percent thought they could have been killed during 1993. Many lived on a
 diet of bread, rice, and pasta, when those goods were available, and had not eaten
 
 
 815
 fresh fruit or vegetables since early 1992. The result was widespread anemia and
 other wasting conditions in children who did not suffer more serious injuries or ill-
 nesses. Children witnessed atrocities, including murder and rape committed against
 their parents and neighbors. Tens of thousands were orphaned, and tens of thou-
 sands more lived in refugee centers. Assessing the psychological effects of war trau-
 ma on children in Sarajevo, Bihac and Banja Luka, UNICEF found that virtually
 all suffered from nightmares and inappropriately apathetic or aggressive behavior
 as a result of exposure to the conflict.
 National IRacial /Ethnic Minorities.-Extreme nationalism precipitated the war to
 cleanse non-Serbs from parts of Bosnia. Other micronationalist ideologies developed
 in the context of violent separatism, and at the end of 1993 national identity was
 a critical factor in whether one would keep a job or lose it, remain at home or be
 driven out, or all too often live or die. Throughout Bosnia, violence, fear, and the
 collapsing social structure eroded support for pluralism. No group was more victim-
 ized than Bosnia's Muslims.
 People with Disabilities.-The pervasiveness of the war, the destruction of the
 economy, and the Government's reduced means limited assistance to the disabled,
 including those disabled bythe war. An example of disregard for the needs of the
 disabled occurred as the HVO withdrew from Fojnica: troops evacuated the doctors
 from a hospital for mentally impaired children, but left the patients behind.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Legally, all workers were free to form or join unions
 of their own choosing without prior authorization. Before the outbreak of the war,
 this right was generally respected. Bosnian workers had independent trade unions,
 while journalists, teachers, and others organized independent professional associa-
 tions to address labor issues. The bulk of-Bosnian workers were probably members
 of the semi-official Council of Independent Trade Unions of Bosnia and Herzegovina
 (CITUBH), although new trade unions were also organized. The right to strike was
 recognized but not exercised in connection with work-related grievances in 1993.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Bosnian law formally guaran-
 teed this right, but the fighting among the three sides interrupted Bosnia's economic
 transition from state domination to a market-oriented system. As a consequence, the
 management of state-owned enterprises had not adopted collective bargaining as a
 practice prior to the war.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced labor was legally prohib-
 ited and did not occur before the outbreak of the war. In some villages, however,
 citizens found themselves under virtual "house arrest" so surrounding forces would
 have a convenient labor pool. As with civilians placed in detention centers, villagers
 under house arrest were sometimes forced to erect shelters or fill sandbags in dan-
 ferous conditions near the front lines. Although the BSA was the main user of
 rced labor, government troops also occasionally surrounded villagers and forced
 them to work. Bugojno was surrounded for most of the summer, and in May govern-
 ment troops surrounded the residents of Banovici and sent some of them to the front
 lines to dig trenches. As the trenches were completed, the troops advanced.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The minimum age for employment
 was 16, although children in agricultural communities sometimes assisted their
 families with farm work before they reached that age. As in 1992, there were occa-
 sional reports in 1993 that children were employed for military functions such as
 reconnaissance and running messages.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-In principle, minimum wages were guaranteed;
 with the economy in total disarray, however, workers had no assurance they would
 be paid for work performed. Dismissals because of ethnicity or political affiliation
 occurred throughout Bosnia. The prewar 42-hour workweek, with a 24-hour rest pe-
 riod, was formally still in effect, and sick leave and other benefits were generous.
 But in the context of the war, benefits counted for little. Regulations on occupational
 health and safety were adequate but not enforced.
