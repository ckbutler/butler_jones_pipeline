 LATVIA
 An independent Baltic state between the two World Wars, Latvia
 was annexed by the Soviet. Union in 1940 as a constituent
 republic of the U.S.S.R. The United States does not recognize
 the forcible incorporation of Latvia into the-U.S.S.R.
 Latvia is subjected to the same centralized rule, the same
 Constitution and judicial system, the same restrictions on
 civil and political liberties, and the same police controls as
 in the Soviet Union. Moreover, Soviet policy toward the
 Latvian nation arouses great concern because the process of
 Sovietization and Russianization threatens its survival as a
 distinct ethnic group. The influx of Slavic'migrants has
 reduced the proportion of Latvians in Latvia to only 53
 percent of the total population. In Riga, the capital of
 Latvia, Latvians comprise only 41 percent of the total
 population.
 Like the other Baltic states, Latvia is regarded as
 economically better off than most areas of the Soviet Union.
 This is beginning to change, however, as the Soviet
 authorities divert scarce resources to less developed areas.
 Although the situation eased somewhat during late 1986 and the
 first half of 1987, human rights violations by the authorities
 continued. Expressions of national consciousness are now made
 more openly but continue to be repressed; harassment of
 religious activists, both clergy and lay people, persists.
 Several leading human rights activists were forced to leave
 Latvia. While certain changes in the Soviet legal code
 currently under discussion might eliminate some laws and
 regulations used to incarcerate or institutionalize Latvian
 human rights activists, their practical effect cannot be
 predicted at this time.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 -Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 Several Latvian activists have died in Soviet custody in
 recent years, but no deaths were reported in 1987.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no known cases of permanent or prolonged
 disappearance.
 c. Torture or Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Throughout the Soviet system, cruel and inhuman treatment of
 prisoners occurs during both interrogation and confinement to
 labor camps, prisons, or psychiatric hospitals. Physical and
 psychological abuse of prisoners is common, as is detention
 under extremely unhealthy or otherwise onerous conditions.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, Exile, or Forced Labor
 Soviet laws are written and interpreted in so broad a manner
 that persons may be arrested and convicted for trying to
 exercise their basic human rights. For example, several
 organizers of the Latvian "Helsinki-86* organization were
 
 
 959
 LATVIA
 arrested in late summer 1986 and held until January 1987, when
 they were released without charges. During 1987 the number of
 such arrests throughout the Soviet Union appeared to have
 decreased sharply, apparently in accord with Soviet Communist
 Party General Secretary Gorbachev's campaign for more
 "openness" in and "democratization" of Soviet society.
 Nonetheless, "Helsinki-86" activist Linards Grantins was
 arrested and convicted in 1987 and reportedly beaten while in
 prison. He was released upon the completion of his sentence.
 Overall, the ability of Latvians to express their views
 without severe reprisals improved somewhat during the first
 part of 1987 but was subsequently restricted. Latvian human
 rights activist Gunars Astra, who has spent almost 20 years
 imprisoned for his nationalist activities, remains in a harsh
 special-regimen labor camp.
 Latvian nationalists Rolands Silaraups and Janis Rozkalns,
 Baptist Lidija Doronina-Lasmane, and Jewish activist Zakhar
 Zunshayn were among those released under a series of U.S.S.R.
 Supreme Soviet decrees, starting in February, which pardoned a
 large number of political prisoners convicted under
 "political" Articles 70 (anti-Soviet agitation and propaganda)
 and 190-1 (anti-Soviet slander) of the Russian Soviet
 Federated Socialist Republic (R.S.F.S.R.) Criminal Code.
 Silaraups and Rozkalns were both forced to emigrate to the
 West. Zunshayn was finally allowed to depart for Israel.
 A review of the Soviet Criminal Code is currently under way,
 which might result in the modification of some of the
 "political" articles in the code.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 As in the Soviet Union, the Communist Party in political cases
 subverts constitutional provisions regarding objective and
 independent judicial procedure. The self-determined
 compelling needs of the State override the rights of a
 defendant. A few Soviet public figures spoke out in 1987 for
 strengthening the rights of defendants in Soviet trials, but
 it is as yet unclear whether or how such reforms would be
 implemented.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Through the use of informers, mail censorship, electronic
 monitoring of telephones, and other means, government
 authorities have the ability--widely exercised--to interfere
 in every aspect of personal life. Nonetheless, interference
 with mail and telephonic communications appears to have
 diminished slightly over the past year. Constitutional
 provisions to the contrary, Soviet investigative agencies do
 not abstain from forced entry and illegal searches.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution provides for most internationally accepted
 political liberties as long as their exercise accords with the
 strengthening and security of the "Socialist" system. In
 practice, the authorities rarely tolerate dissident behavior
 of any kind. While Gorbachev's "glasnost'" (openness)
 campaign has expanded the ability-of official and unofficial
 writers to explore heretofore taboo subjects and to spotlight
 
 
 960
 LATVIA
 economic and social problems, these opportunities are still
 subject to controls, and their limits have not been stabilized
 or defined. A new press law is being drafted. No questioning
 of Latvia's status as a Soviet republic or of the Communist
 Party's monopoly of power is permitted. All Latvian
 newspapers, magazines, journals, and books remain firmly under
 the control of the Communist Party, which ultimately decides
 what shall or shall not be published.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The peaceful assembly of citizens is subject.to arbitrary and
 unpredictable levels of harassment and repression. On June
 14, however, several thousand Latvians took part in an
 unpretedented, unofficial demonstration in Riga to commemorate
 the deportation of tens of thousands of Latvians by Stalin in
 1941. The authorities tried to head off the demonstration by
 calling up some of the organizers for military reserve duty,
 arresting one when he refused to report, and by scheduling a
 bicycle race in an attempt to close off the square where the
 demonstration was to take place. Once it was under way,
 however, the authorities allowed it to proceed with only
 minimal disruption.
 On August 23, an even larger unofficial demonstration was held
 in Riga to bring pressure on the Soviet Government to renounce
 the signing in 1939 of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Non-Aggression
 Pact between Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union, which became
 the basis for Soviet occupation and annexation of Latvia.
 While the authorities did not openly interfere with the
 demonstration, they strongly denounced it in the press,
 accused Western radio stations of instigating it, and
 castigated several of the organizers, members of the
 "Helsinki-86" Group. Several "Helsinki-86" organizers,
 including Janis Rozkalns, Janis Barkans, and Rolands
 Silaraups, have since been forced to leave Latvia.
 On November 18, the Soviets employed an extensive media
 campaign and heavy police presence to prevent the celebration
 of the anniversary of Latvia's independence. Demonstrators
 who attempted to lay flowers at nationalist monuments were
 beaten and detained.
 The right of association is provided for in the Constitution,
 but this right has been limited by legislation and regime
 policy. The regime continues to exercise strict control over
 official mass organizations. Unofficial groups were tolerated
 in 1987, but there were instances of harassment, and their
 status remains insecure.
 Although the Constitution grants all Soviet citizens the right
 to form trade unions, any efforts by workers to exercise this
 right independently of state-sponsored and -controlled unions
 have been brutally repressed.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Despite constitutional provisions, religious activity is the
 object of systematic official harassment. Church activities
 are tightly circumscribed, and the party and Government
 promote atheism through all possible channels. In May about
 two dozen Latvian Lutheran pastors demanded the convocation of
 a general synod to protest the dismissal of Dean Modris Plate
 from the church district of Ruldiga at government insistence,
 despite the protests of his parishioners. A popular preacher,
 
 
 961
 LATVIA
 Plate had reportedly drawn large crowds to his services and
 had protested the refusal of the church leadership to reassign
 another dismissed pastor, Mars Ludviks, to a new parish.
 Four other Evangelical Lutheran pastors, Armands Akmentins,
 Juris Rubenis, Janis Vanags, and Dean Aivars Beimanis, were
 threatened with revocation of their license to preach and
 possible expulsion from Latvia.
 In September several Russian Orthodox believers in Riga, along
 with believers in other Soviet cities, signed an open letter
 to Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet Andrey
 Gromyko, calling for changes in the Criminal Code and existing
 legislation on religion. During the same month, several
 Lutheran pastors and seminary teachers announced the creation
 of a new group, "Rebirth and Renewal," and issued a document
 calling upon the church leadership to approach Latvian and
 Soviet authorities to review the possibility of changes in the
 religious legislation of both Latvia and the U.S.S.R. The
 authorities responded with a blistering press attack on the
 group.
 Members of the smaller Roman Catholic, Baptist,
 Pentecostalist, and Seventh-Day Adventist churches continued
 to encounter difficulties with the authorities as well.
 Popular Pentecostalist preacher Nikolay Shevchuk was forced
 into emigration following official harassment and a vicious
 newspaper assault. Many Jews and several Latvian
 Pentecostalists wishing to emigrate have been denied
 permission to do so. In general, the policies of "glasnost,"
 and "perestroyka" (restructuring) have benefited religious
 believers less than other'social groups.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Soviet authorities do not respect the right of emigration by
 choice. The granting of permission to travel abroad for
 family reunification or on a temporary basis is arbitrary and
 subject to tight restrictions. The authorities often harass
 Latvians whose desire to emigrate is known by denying them
 work in their specialty, by excluding them from educational
 institutions, and by other punitive measures. Nonetheless,
 the increase in the issuance of exit permits from the Soviet
 Union during 1987 has resulted in the emigration of an
 increased number of Latvian Jews. Although some Latvian
 activists were allowed to depart voluntarily for the West, the
 majority were expelled for their human rights activities.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Citizens are not free to change the system of government. As
 in other areas under Soviet control, political activity
 outside the Communist Party is not tolerated.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Soviet Government in late 1986 and 1987 repeatedly
 expressed its readiness to discuss human rights issues--a
 change from previous practice--and created an Administration
 for Humanitarian and Cultural Ties in the Foreign Ministry.
 Nonetheless, the Government's attitude towards investigation
 of the human rights situation in Latvia remained basically
 
 
 962
 LATVIA
 negative. Cases of jailing of human rights activists during
 1987 decreased, and there were no known cases of sentencing of
 such activists under "political" Articles 70 and 190-1 of the
 R.S.F.S.R. Criminal Code.
 Section 5 'Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Discrimination on the basis of race, sex, or other groinds is
 prohibitedlin the Constitution. Since its annexatidn, Latvia,
 with its population of about 2.5 million, has been an
 industrial workshop and trading center for the Soviet Union.
 Industrialization was accumpanied by a large influx of Slavic
 workers from the Soviet Union and brought about a shift in-the
 ethnic balance aggravated by Latvians' low birth rate.
 The large proportion (now at-least 47 percent) of non-Latvians
 in the population has increased ethnic frictions and placed
 the Latvian language and culture in jeopardy. The last few
 years have seen an increase in Latvian nationalist sentiment
 as more Latvians have become alarmed at the precarious
 position of their language and culture. Lltvians complain
 that while they must learn Russian, few Russians residing in
 Latvia bother to learn Latvian. Ethnic tensions flare up in
 increased anti-Russian graffiti and occasional street brawls
 between Latvian and Russian youths. In the summer of 1987,
 the authorities discussed programs to expand the study of
 Latvian by children in the early grades of elementary school,
 to increase textbooks and courses in the Latvian language
 available for Russian-speaking adults, and to improve the
 qualifications of language teachers.
 Women nominally enjoy the same legal rights as men, and an
 extensive system of day-care service and maternity benefits
 enables women to obtain and retain employment outside the
 home. In general, howeveri women hold less remunerative
 positions than men do in the same occupatiohs.
 CONDITIONS OF LABOR
 Labor conditions in Latvia are identical to those in the
 Soviet Union: The statutory minimum wage for the employment
 of children in 1986 was 16, and the standard workweek was 40
 hours. There is no indication of widespread violation of
 these norms. The minimum wage was set at $112 per month at
 the official rate of exchange. According to the latest Soviet
 official data, the average wage is about $272 per month.
 Soviet law establishes, in general terms, minimum health and
 safety conditions. According to the Soviet press, the laws on
 maximum hours of work and health and safety standards are
 widely ignored.
