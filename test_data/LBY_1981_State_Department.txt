 LIBYA
 The Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya describes
 its form of government as "popular democracy," but the
 country is essentially under the control of a military
 dictator, Col. M'uammar al-Qadhafi. The governing prin-
 ciples of the society are expressed in Qadhafi's "Third
 Universal Theory"--the Green Book--rather than in the
 constitution. The Libyans have created a government
 which they regard as being heavily based on Islamic
 teachings, and which ostensibly emphasizes full partici-
 pation of the people in the decisions which affect their
 daily lives. This participation comes through a system
 of increasingly active people's committees, which not
 only operate local government, but also control virtually
 every local enterprise, ranging from farming and manu-
 facturing to the education and social institutions of
 the country. These committees are powerful in terms of
 local decisions but Qadhafi--though holding no formal
 government position--remains the single arbiter of all
 important issues in Libya.
 Since Qadhafi came to power in 1969, Libyan oil income has
 grown rapidly and reached approximately $24 billion in
 1980. While some of this revenue has been used to finance
 an active internal development program (new schools,
 hcspitals, roads) to benefit the Libyan population of
 about 2.8 million, many billions of dollars have also
 been spent to acquire a huge arsenal. In addition,
 Qadhafi has orchestrated a campaign of subversion against
 moderate states and has supported a wide range of terrorist
 groups in virtually every area of the globe. Libyan
 revenues declined considerably in 1981 (to about $7 bil-
 lion) because of unrealistic oil pricing policies. Many
 development projects are being postponed. Weapons pur-
 chases and support for terrorism have not declined
 appreciably, although Qadhafi has admitted that financial
 problems have made it difficult for him to finance "libera-
 tion movements."
 The 1980 assassination campaign against Libyan exiles, a
 form of domestic persecution practiced abroad, continued
 in early 1981 with murders in the UK and Italy. The
 theoretical basis of this campaign was enunciated in 1980
 at the Third Conference of the Revolutionary Councils. A
 resolution was adopted which charged the committees with
 the "liquidation of the elements that hinder the revolu-
 tion." Qadhafi himself, in a March 2, 1981 speech at
 Sebh; elaborated on this theme:
 "We continue to liquidate our opponents. The physical
 and final liquidation of the opponents of popular
 authority must continue at home and abroad, everywhere."
 *TheU.S. Embassy in Tripoli was attacked by a mob on Decem-
 ber 2, 1979; thereafter, the staff was drastically reduced
 and Embassy operations were suspended. On May 2, 1980 the
 Embassy was closed and there is no plan to reopen it in the
 immediate future. Because of the absence of a United States
 Mission in Libya, this report draws heavily on unofficial
 sources.

 Since 1969 the regime has prided itself on its "white (or
 bloodless) revolution. However, the considerable change
 for the worse in Libya's human rights picture, including
 reports of marked increases in torture and abuse, which
 began in 1980, appears to have continued in 1981.
 I.   Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom
 from:
 a.* Torture
 During 1981 there were numerous reports of a widespread
 campaign of arrests and trials and allegations of torture
 and mistreatment of prisoners. The "Economist" (October 10,
 1981) alleged that the Oadhafi regime had arrested more
 than 3,000 persons since the beginning of the arrest cam-
 paign in 1980. Many of them reportedly were executed or
 tortured to death. The methods of torture most commonly
 reported to Amnesty International include electric shocks
 to the head and genitals and beatings on the soles of the
 feet. Much of the torture is alleged to have occurred in
 security service facilities in Tripoli and Benghazi.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 Detainees in criminal and security cases reportedly are
 frequently beaten during interrogation. There continue to
 be accounts of cruel treatment of prisoners. In some pri-
 sons conditions are tolerable, but in others--particularly
 where political prisoners are held--reports suggest that
 beatings and other forms of degrading treatment are common-
 place. Amnesty International has expressed concern about
 the large number of offenses, including political offenses,
 which are punishable by death under Libyan law. Reports
 persist of summary executions or deaths by torture of some
 of those arrested during 1981. There were, for example,
 press reports that about 30 participants in an April coup
 attempt were executed. Death sentences imposed upon a
 group of Berber dissidents also condemned in April were
 to have been carried out during the summer.  It is not
 known publicly whether they were executed. (See also
 Section 2 a. for arrests of religous opponents.)
 c. Disappearances
 There continue to be reports that Libyan businessmen, former
 government officials, religious oppositionists and political
 activists have been taken into custody by the government
 with no further information available as to their conditions,
 whereabouts or charges lodged against them. Referring to
 the problem of disappearances in Libya, Amnesty International
 stated in its 1981 report that detainees were apparently
 held incommunicado for unlimited periods in centers belonging
 to the intelligence services.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 Under Law 84 of 1975 (establishing the office of the revolu-
 tionary security prosecutor) detainees may be held incom-
 municado for unlimited periods. Libya declared four years
 ago that there were then "no political detainees on any
 charge in its prisons." Reports from a variety of sources,
 
 
 1040
 however, claim that Libyan prisons contain increased numbers
 of persons convicted of or held for political offenses.
 Amnesty International in 1979 estimated the number to be
 80. The 1980-81 arrest campaign certainly pushed that
 number far higher, particularly with the detention in
 December of 1,000-1,500 students, merchants and military
 men. A clear example of an individual subjected to poli-
 tical imprisonment is Bashir Dultz, a former employee of
 the American Embassy in Tripoli, who is serving a life
 -sentence on the false charge of espionage on behalf of the
 United States. Revolutionary Committees were used during
 1981 as instruments for political persecution and arbitrary
 arrest.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The normal court structure in Libya has been by-passed to
 some extent by the people's courts. This parallel legal
 system has far fewer safeguards, and the trials are fre-
 quently held in camera or in absentia. In January 1981,
 Law No. 4 prohibited the private practice of law and made
 all attorneys employees of the secretariat of justice.
 The Union of Arab Lawyers expressed concern for the ability
 and freedom of attorneys, who are also justice secretariat
 employees, to provide aggressive legal defense for political
 prisoners. The Libyan authorities have claimed that they
 "guarantee prisoners all necessary means of defense and
 safeguards of justice adequate to the principles contained
 in the declaration of human rights." The accused may con-
 tact their lawyers and families "as soon as possible with
 respect to the exigencies of interrogation." In routine
 civil or criminal cases, these governments claims appear
 to reflect accurately the prevailing situation.
 In security cases, there are many reports of prisoners
 being held incommunicado and without trial for long periods.
 While undergoing interrogation--sometimes for periods of
 several months--they are given no access to legal repre-
 sentation. There are reports that senior military officers
 and civilian officials, arrested in 1980, were tried last
 February by ad hoc "Revolutionary Courts" rather than
 through the normal judiciary procedure and that the defense
 was severely restricted.
 f. Invasion of the Home
 The legal stipulation that judicial warrants must first
 be obtained reportedly is often disregarded.
 2.   Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, including:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 Col. Qadhafi's government continues to restrict severely
 basic civil and political freedoms. The right of associa-
 tion is granted only to those institutions affiliated with
 the apparatus of the regime. The media are controlled
 rigorously, and newspapers do not print editorials. The
 official news agency JANA is a conduit for politically
 acceptable opinions.
 
 
 1041
 Libyans are most circumspect about uttering dissident
 views toward the regime's policies. Token criticism of
 the government is permitted during people's committee
 meetings and at the annual General People's Congress.
 "New York Times" correspondent Alan Cowell, who was in
 Libya in November, found the "pervasive nervousness and
 fear generated by internal security agencies" so great
 that no one dared-speak for the record.  ("New York
 Times", December 2, 1981).
 However, some Libyans outside of their homeland did speak
 out in 1981. Ahmed Ibrahim Ehwas, who resigned his post
 as Libyan charge d'affaires in Guyana in early 1981,
 decried the "terrorism, despotism, force and aggression
 at Qadhafi's hands, as well as the confiscation of freedom
 and property at such an unprecedented scales" which he
 observed on his visits to Libya. Ibrahim Abdul-Aziz
 Sahad, Libyan charge d'affaires in Argentina, quit the
 Libyan Government in August because of his "great distress
 (about) the suffering of the Libyan people under this
 dictatorial and criminal regime". The diplomat accused
 the Qadhafi regime of practicing the "most vicious and
 inhuman acts of torture and maltreatment, both physical
 and psychological" against innocent Libyan citizens.
 Their statements echoed that of the former Libyan ambas-
 sador to India, Muhammad Yousef Lemgurief, who went into
 opposition last year lamenting the "degree of terror". and
 lack of civil liberties and rights in Libya. On February 21,
 1981, a Tripoli revolutionary tribunal sentenced Ambassador
 Lemgurief to death in absentia. His colleagues were con-
 demned in absentia later.
 Libya is overwhelmingly Muslim. There are virtually no
 Jews; services are permitted in a few Christian churches.
 The once-powerfUl Sanusiyya religious organization was
 virtually banned by Qadhafi after the revolution as part
 of his efforts to eliminate rival power bases. Restric-
 tions were placed on the operation of the organization's
 Zawaayaa (lodges), a government supervisor was appointed
 for Sanusi properties, and the Sanusi-sponsored Islamic
 University was merged with the University of Libya. It
 was reported that 15 persons were arrested in a Tripoli
 mosque in late 1980. Amnesty International received
 information that five of these, including a mosque offi-
 cial, may have been executedin 1981. Amnesty International's
 requests to the Libyan justice secretary for information
 on this case have gone unanswered. Some 200 members of
 the Moslem Brotherhood and another extremist religious
 group are said to have been detained during the.first
 half of 1981.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration and Repatriation
 With the exception of security areas, freedom of movement
 within the country is unrestricted for Libyan citizens.
 An exit permit is required for travel abroad. Military
 conscription regulations have led to some restrictions
 on the issuance of exit permits to potential inductees.
 It is reportedly increasingly difficult for Libyan
 nationals suspected of inadequate revolutionary zeal
 to travel abroad. Information concerning current Libyan
 policy with regard to emigration or voluntary repatriation
 is unavailable.
 
 
 1042
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Libya describes itself as the world's only Jamahiriya,
 or "Republic of the Masses." Major changes in the organi-
 zation of the Libyan state occured in 1977. These changes
 were intended by Qadhafi to replace subnational leaders,
 chosen on traditional and cultural bases, with leaders
 selected by and presumably loyal to Qadhafi. The changes
 centered on the establishment of the general people's
 congress and the appointment of the general people's
 committee and a series of subordinate popular committees.
 Although political parties have been outlawed, many people
 participate in the system through the local committees.
 Efforts have been made to recruit women and members of
 the Berber minority into this local political structure.
 Trade and professional unions were viewed by Qadhafi as
 threats to his power, and he vowed not to "accept inter-
 mediaries (unions) between the revolution and its working
 forces." The previous trade union system was changed
 considerably, and new ones were organized under government
 control. These were integrated into the popular committees.
 Col. Qadhafi has urged workers to take over the business
 firms which employ them. Many have done so and the pattern
 now is for the workers to elect their own management,
 subject to the control of the local committee. collective
 bargaining no longer occurs.
 Major decisions are made by Qadhafi himself, as are all
 appointments of military officers and official functionaries
 down to a low level. Power flows down from Qadhafi, who is
 more and more isolated, and who surrounds himself with an
 increasingly small circle of associates whose own authority
 is a reflection of their proximity to him. Qadhafi appears
 to be estranged from the military and seems to rely in-
 creasingly on East German security forces to remain in
 power.
 3. Government Attitude and Record Regarding International
 and Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged
 Violations of Human Rights
 An Amnesty International mission went to Libya in early
 1980. Following the mission, Amnesty International issued
 a memorandum "setting forth its concerns to the authorities
 in which it called upon the Libyan authorities to put an
 end to 'physical liquidation' and to implement fully the
 provisions of the international instruments guaranteeing
 human rights which they had ratified." The Libyan authori-
 ties have failed to respond to wkitten requests from
 Amnesty International for information on specific cases.
 4. Economic and Social Circumstances
 Libya's substantial oil wealth has allowed the government
 to make real improvements in the Libyan People's material
 standards, despite the curtailment of political and
 religious freedoms. Per capita GNP rose from $5,560 (1971)
 to $8,170 (1979) and was higher in 1980 and the first part
 of 1981. Investment in health facilities and a marked
 
 
 1043
 growth in female literacy over the past decade increased
 life expeetancy at birth to 56.4 years (1979) from the
 earlier 51.9 (1971). The infant mortality rate was down
 from 21.9 per 1,000 in 1971 to 15.7 in 1979. During the
 same period the percentage of the population with access
 to safe water increased from 58 to 100, and the percentage
 of calorie supply available for consumption relative to
 nutritional requirements increased from 105 to 126.
 Libya's unrealistically high oil prices cut revenues by
 about two-thirds during 1981, and there are increasing
 reports of shortages of imported foodstuffs as well as
 luxury items. There is also information that the
 authorities are cutting back on some development projects,
 including agriculture, and are attempting to barter high-
 priced crude oil instead of paying cash for goods and
 services. The stifling of dissent and freedom of speech
 by the virtually autonomous revolutionary committees has
 already had a chilling effect on teaching and academic
 freedom at the university level. Whether this will
 affect the educational progress which has been made at
 the secondary and primary levels remains to be seen.
