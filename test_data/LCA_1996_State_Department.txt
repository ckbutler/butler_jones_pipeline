 SAINT LUCIA
 St. Lucia is a multiparty, parliamentary democracy and a member of the Com-
 monwealth of Nations. The Government comprises a prime minister, a cabinet, and
 a bicameral legislative assembly. A Governor General, appointed by the British
 monarch, is the titular head of state with largely ceremonial powers. In an
 intraparty transfer of power in March, John Compton of the United Workers Party
 
 
 556
 (UWP) stepped down as Prime Minister and party leader in favor of Dr. Vaughan
 Lewis. (Compton had served as Prime Minister from 1964 to 1979, and from 1982
 until his resignation.) The UWP holds 12 of 17 seats in the House of Assembly.
 The Royal Saint Lucia Police is the only security force and includes a small unit
 called the Special Services Unit (which has some paramilitary training) and a coast
 guard unit. Although the police have traditionally demonstrated a high degree ofreo-
 spect for human rights, there were allegations of abuse by police and prison officials.
 The economy is based on tourism and on the export of bananas, which represent
 the principal sources of foreign exchange earnings. Saint Lucia is divers'ng its
 economy into other types of agriculture, light manufacturing, and construction. Un-
 employment, estimated at 20 percent, remains a source of potential instability.
 The authorities generally respected human rights. Government criticism of the
 media, occasional credible allegations of physical abuse of suspects or prisoners,
 poor prison conditions, domestic violence against women, child abuse, and a lack of
 effective government children's rights programs continued to be problems.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political or
 other extrajudicial killings.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution specifically prohibits torture, and there were no reports of such
 abuse. However, many criminal convictions in recent years have been based on con-
 fessions, which may reflect an effort by police to force confessions rather than use
 investigative approaches.
 Poor prison conditions stem from a lack of resources. The island's only prison,
 built in the 1800's to house a maximum of 101 prisoners, has over 400 prisoners,
 resulting in severe overcrowding. Prison guards are generally well-trained.
 The Government permits prison visits by human rights monitors.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Government adheres to the constitu-
 tional provisions prohibiting arbitrary arrest or imprisonment and requiring a court
 hearing within 72 hours aer detention. However, the authorities have frequently
 held prisoners for years "on remand" after charging them (there is no constitutional
 requirement for a speedy trial).
 There were no reports of forced exile.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution provides for an independent judi-
 ciary, and it is independent in practice.
 There are two levels of courts: Courts of summary jurisdiction (magistrate's
 courts) and the High Court. Both levels have civil and criminal authority. The lower
 courts accept civil claims up to about $1,900 (EC$5,000) in value, and criminal cases
 generally classified as "petty." The upper court has unlimited authority in both civil
 and criminal cases. All cases can be appealed to the Organization of Eastern Carib-
 bean States Court of Appeal. From there, cases may be appealed to the Privy Coun-
 cil in London as the final court of appeal.
 The Constitution requires public trials before an independent and impartial court
 and, in cases involving capital punishment, provision of legal counsel for those who
 cannot afford a defense attorney. In criminal cases not involving capital punish-
 ment, defendants must obtain their own legal counsel. Defendants are entitled to
 select their own legal counsel, are presumed innocent until proven guilty in court,
 and have the right of appeal. The authorities observe both constitutional and statu-
 tory requirements for fair public trials.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution prohibits such practices. Government authorities generally respect
 these prohibitions, and violations are subject to effective legal sanctions.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-Although the Government generally respects
 constitutional provisions for free speech and press, it occasionally has demonstrated
 open hostility toward both the print media and radio. However, the Government's
 attitude toward the press does not appear to affect press freedoms in Saint Lucia.
 Five privately owned newspapers, two privately owned radio stations, and one
 partially government-funded radio station operate in St. Lucia. They carry a wide
 spectrum of political opinion and are often critical of the Government. The radio sta-
 tions have discussion and call-in programs that allow people to express their views.
 The two local television stations are also privately owned and cover a wide range
 
 
 557
 of views. In addition, people can subscribe to cable television service, which provides
 programming from a variety of sources.
 The Government does not restrict academic freedom.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 freedom of association and assembly, and the Government generally respects these
 rights in practice. The law reuires permits for public meetings and demonstrations
 if they are to be held in publi places, such as on streets or sidewalks or in parks.
 The police routinely grant such permits; the rare refusal generally stems from the
 failure of organizers to request the permit in a timely manner, normally 48 hours
 before the event. Police used tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse strikers during
 an October strike by banana farmers, resulting in several serious injurie.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of reigion, and the
 Government respects this right in practice.
 d. Freedom ofMovement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 pairiation.-The Constitution provides for these rights, and the Governmnt re-
 spcts them in practice.
 No formal government plicy toward refugee or asylum requests exists. The issue
 of thejprovision of first asylum did not arise. There were no reports of forced expul-
 sion of anyone havg a valid claim to refugee status; however, government practice
 remains undefined.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens have the right to change their government. Saint Lucia's parliamentary
 system provides for genuine choices among parties, policies, and officials. The 1996
 merger of the smaller parties--the Concerned Citizens' Movement, St. Lucia Free-
 dom Pat, and Citizens' Democratic Party-with the opposition St. Lucia Labour
 Party (SLP) leaves St. Lucia with two major parties: The SL  and the ruling United
 Workers Party (UWP). Under the Constitution, general elections must be held by
 April 1997, but could be called at any time before then by the Government. Elec-
 tions are held at least every 5 years by secret ballot. The SLP plays a significant
 role in the country's plitica life and holds 5 of the 17 seats in the Legislative
 House of Assembly. Two members of the Senate are independent, appointed by the
 Governor General.
 There are no legal impediments to participation by women and minorities in gov-
 ernment. Both the Attorney General and the Deputy Leader of the Senate are
 women. However, women and minorities are not represented in numbers propor-
 tional to their percentage of the population.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 While there are no local human rights groups, there are no governmental restric-
 tions that would prevent their formation.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cia Status
 Government policy is nondiscriminatory in the areas of housing, jobs, education,
 and opportunity for advancement. There are no legal restrictions on the role of
 women or minorities.
 Women.-There is increased awareness of the seriousness of violence against
 women. The Government does not prosecute crimes of violence against women un-
 less the victim herself presess charges. If the victim chooses for any reason not to
 press charges, the Government cannot bring a case. Charges must be brought under
 he ornary civil code. The police force conucts some training for pice officers re-
 sponsible for investigating rape and other crimes against women. Police and courts
 enforce laws to protect women against abuse, although police are hesitant to inter-
 vene in domestic disputes, and many victims are reluctant to report cases of domes-
 tic violence and rape or to press charges.
 The 1994 Domestic Violence Act allows a judge to issue a protection order prohib-
 iting an abuser from entering or remaining in the place where the victim is. It also
 allows the judge to order that an abusers name be removed from housing leases
 or rental agreements, with the effect that the abuser would no longer have the right
 to live in the same residene as the victim.
 The Saint Lucia Crisis Center monitors cases of abuse (physical and emotional)
 and helps its clients deal with such problems as incest, nonpayment of child sup-
 port, alcohol and drug abuse, homelessness, custody, and visitation rights. The
 tions thas publicized the plight of battered women and has protested the rare
 ths of women who were victims of domestic violence. The Crisis Center is also
 working to establish a shelter for battered women and homeless girls. Some second-
 
 
 558
 ary schools address the problem of sexual harassment and battering in their cur-
 riculum topics.
 The Minister for Women's Affairs is responsible for protecting women's rights in
 domestic violence cases and preventing discrimination against women, including
 equal treatment in employment.
 Children.-Despite the 1992 Children's Rights Act, which details a strong commit-
 ment to children s rights, the Government has not fulfilled that commitment with
 effective programs. Domestic violence and incest continued to be among the prob-
 lems most affecting the welfare of children in Saint Lucia. The St. Lucia Crisis Cen-
 ter reported that incidents of child abuse increased substantially compared to 1995.
 People With Disabilities.-There is no specific legislation protecting the rights of
 the disabled, nor mandating provision of access to buildings or government services
 for them. There is no rehabilitation facility for the physicaly disabled, although the
 Health Ministry operates a community-based rehsbiitation program in residnts'
 homes. There are schools for the deaf and for the blind up to the secondary level.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution specifies the right of workers to
 form or belong to trade unions under the broader rubric of the right of association.
 Most public sector employees are unionized; about 20 percent of the total work force
 is unionized. Unions are independent of government, and are free to choose their
 own representatives in often vigorously contested elections. However, there have
 been recent, unsubstantiated reports of government obstruction of attempts to have
 union views publicizd. There are no restrictions on the formation of national labor
 federations. In 1994 several of the major unions formed an umbrella grouping called
 the "Industrial Solidarity Pact.3 Unions are free to affiliate with international orga-
 nizations, and some have done so.
 Strikes in both the public and private sectors are legal, but there are many ave-
 nues through collective bargaining agreement and government procedures which
 may preclude a strike. The law prohibits the police and fire departments from strik-
 ing. Other "essential services" workers-water and sewer authority workers, electric
 utility workers, nurses, and doctors-must give 30 days' notice before striking. Ba-
 nana farmers conducted a 12-day strike in October to protest a government charge
 for cartons.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Unions have the legal right
 to engage in collective bargaining, and they fully exercise this right. Union rep-
 resentatives have reported attempts by Government and other employers to under-
 mine this process.
 The law prohibits antiunion discrimination by employers, and there are effective
 mechanisms for resolving complaints. It also requires that employers reinstate
 workers fired for union activities.
 Labor law is applicable in the export processing zones (EPZ's), and there are no
 administrative or legal impediments to union organizing or collective bargaining in
 those zones. In practice, however, many firms resist union efforts to organize in the
 EPZ's, even to the point of closing operations.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced or compulsory labor is ille-
 gal and does not exist.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The Women's and Young Persons
 Act stipulates a minimum legal working age of 14 years. Ministry of Labour officials
 are responsible for enforcing the law. There were no reports of violations of child
 labor laws.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The Wages Regulations (Clerks) Orders, in ef-
 fect since 1985, set out minimum wage rates only for clerks. These office workers
 receive a legislated minimum wage of about $300 (EC$800) per month. The mini-
 mum wage is not sufficient to provide a decent standard of living for a worker sup-
 eorting a four-person family, but some categories of workers receive more than the
 egal minimum for clerks, which is used only as a guide for setting pay for other
 professions.
 There is no legislated workweek, although the common practice is to work 40
 hours in 5 days. Special legislation covers hours which shop assistants, agricultural
 workers, domestics, and young people in industrial establishments may work.
 Occupational health and safety regulations are relatively well developed. The
 Labor Ministry periodically inspects health and safety conditions at places of em-
 ployment under the Employees' Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1985. The
 Ministry enforces the act through threat of closure of the business if it discovers vio-
 lations and the violator does not correct them. Workers are free to leave a dan-
 gerous workplace situation without jeopardy to continued employment.
