 CUBA
 Cuba is governed by a tightly interwoven hierarchy at the apex
 of which is a single individual, Fidel Castro, who is chief of
 state, head of government, leader of the Communist Party, and
 commander of Cuba's armed forces. Taking power in 1959 from
 an often harsh and arbitrary dictatorship, the Castro
 Government quickly transformed itself into a Communist regime
 and instituted a far more systematically repressive order, one
 in which previous restrictions on basic human rights were
 greatly magnified and made pervasive. Supported by a few
 longtime close associates, Castro controls all aspects of
 Cuban life through a network of interlocking directorates
 centered on the Communist Party. All state authority is
 subservient to the party, which controls all aspects of the
 daily life of Cuba's citizens. Their political, social, and
 economic existence is regimented to meet the goals set by the
 party and State and to prevent spontaneous or unplanned social
 behavior. The party ensures internal security and conformity
 with these goals through the Ministry of Interior, which
 operates border and police forces, orchestrates and controls
 all public demonstrations, investigates evidence of
 nonconformity, regulates migration, and maintains a pervasive
 system of informers and block wardens. Civil liberties in
 particular may not be exercised "contrary to the decision of
 the Cuban people to build socialism and communism" (Article 61
 of the Constitution of the Republic of Cuba). Thus they. exist
 only to the degree the state deems expedient.
 Before Castro took power, although Cuba had an expanding
 economy and a small but growing middle class, poverty was
 widespread. Today, income distribution has the appearance of-
 being more egalitarian, but there is substantial evidence that
 while the political and military elite live in relative
 comfort, most people must cope with a persistent and severe
 scarcity of food and consumer items. Most necessities are
 still rationed--27 years after the revolution--and sometimes
 wholly unavailable. Many consumer items may be acquired, if
 at all, only at extremely high prices in the "parallel
 market." What "private sector" there is is too small to be
 economically significant. Inefficiency and low productivity
 characterize the state sector, where the incentive to produce
 is conspicuously absent.
 It is very difficult to obtain specific information about the
 human rights situation in Cuba because of tight controls by
 the Government. Despite this difficulty, some details do
 become known outside Cuba. Those details confirm that there
 was no improvement in the human rights situation in Cuba in
 ï¿½1985. Former political prisoners have reported or confirmed
 that the Cuban Government continues to abuse basic human
 rights, including the use of torture and denial of fair public
 trial . Many political prisoners remain in jail after the
 expiration of their original and often very lengthy sentences.
 There have been credible reports of continuing arrests for
 political crimes. Freedom of speech is not permitted. The
 practice of religion is actively discouraged and in some cases
 prohibited, despite an effort by the Government to appear open
 to a dialogue with the Catholic church. In recent months the
 Castro regime has displayed greater sensitivity to foreign
 opinion regarding Cuba's human rights record by offering to
 release a few very long-term political prisoners on the
 condition that they leave Cuba, but there is no evidence of
 fundamental improvement in a system where dissent can find
 expression only outside the framework of the law.

 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section I Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 After the Castro movement seized power in 1959, it promptly
 began a series of show trials and summary executions of
 persons alleged to have carried out political crimes as
 officials of the previous government. There are credible
 reports that the use of executions to deter political dissent
 continues. A report of the unofficial Cuban Committee on
 Human Rights smuggled out of Cuba in the summer of 1985 cited
 a number of recent examples of execution by firing squad.
 Three brothers, Cipriano, Ventura, and Eugenio Garcia Matin
 reportedly were executed. Their mother, Margarita Matin
 Thompson, is said to have been sentenced to serve 25 years in
 "Nuevo Amanecer" prison on conviction for "dangerousness"
 (peligrosidad). The report also mentioned the executions of
 two university students, Maximo Galan Zaldivar and Ismael
 Cepero. Former political prisoner Jorge Valls Arango, who was
 released in 1984, has stated that he saw many executions
 during his more than 20 years in prison.
 The report of the Cuban Committee on Human Rights also noted
 that Guido Faraminan Hernandez, a former labor leader jailed
 in 1965 for opposing government control of the Cuban
 Confederation of Workers (CTC), may have died of unnatural
 causes in the hospital of the Combinado del Este prison in
 April 1985. His family was told that he had died of a heart
 attack, but prison authorities refused to turn over the body
 to his relatives. Also, according to the Committee, Felipe
 Hernandez, a vice president of the Jehovah's Witnesses, died
 under similar circumstances in early 1984. More recently, the
 Committee asserted, Caridad Pavon Tamayo, a Cuban Solidarity
 activist, and Sara Oquendo Hernandez, a teacher, poet, and
 human rights activist, met the same fate while in prison.
 Most recently, on November 18, 1985, a 16-year-old boy was
 shot to death and an 18-year-old companion possibly wounded by
 Cuban police guards when the two attempted to gain access to
 the Venezuelan Embassy in Havana. According to all accounts,
 no attempts were made to warn or negotiate with the boys, who
 were simply shot on sight--disturbing evidence of the regime's
 standing orders in such matters. This was the third person
 killed at the Venezuelan Embassy in the last 22 months and the
 21st killed there since 1974.
 b. Disappearance
 When individuals are arrested by the Cuban secret police,
 friends and family risk retribution if they ask about them.
 Rarely are individuals tried publicly for political crimes;
 sentences are also often secret. When those Cubans who have
 been able to emigrate and become citizens of another country
 return to Cuba to visit relatives, their new citizenship is
 not acknowledged by the Cuban Government. If arrested, they
 are denied contact with consular officials. If they
 disappear, the Cuban Government refuses to provide any
 information about them to authorities of their new countries
 of citizenship.

 CUBA
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Former long-term political prisoners have provided firsthand
 descriptions of the deplorable conditions they were forced to
 endure during the period from the early 1960's through
 mid-1984. There is no evidence that conditions improved in
 1985. The prisoners reported major, systematic abuses,
 including: beatings-by guards and officers; withholding of
 food and water; inadequate diet; withholding of medical care;
 withholding of fresh air and exercise; withholding of family
 visits for years; withholding of mail for years; solitary
 confinement; physical injury caused by electronic noise
 machines; participation of prison medical staff in acts of
 torture; and suspected medical experiments carried out without
 the permission of prisoners.
 Armando Valladares, the noted writer and poet and a former
 political prisoner, has described Cuba's prisons as "America's
 Gulag" and observed that torture is systematically practiced
 to try to make prisoners accept Communism. Cuba's degrading
 treatment of political prisoners, in violation of the American
 Declaration on Human Rights, the deficient medical treatment
 for those incarcerated, and the deplorable condition of Cuban
 prisons have repeatedly been denounced by the Inter-American
 Human Rights Commission, most recently in October 1985.
 The Cuban Committee on Human Rights reported in 1985 that
 Professor Antonio Penabaz Tobio is being kept--without medical
 attention--in Combinado del Este prison hospital, suffering
 from a beating with rifle butts that was administered by state
 security personnel when arresting him. He was arrested for
 peacefully opposing the state of oppression existing in Cuba
 and for explaining the civil liberties that exist in
 democratic countries. The Committee also reported that more
 than 120 youths between the ages of 16 and 20 are prisoners in
 Combinado del Este, serving sentences of 15 to 25 years.
 These persons were said to have been beaten badly upon being
 arrested for crimes they claim they did not commit.
 Political prisoners who refuse to accept political
 indoctrination or be classified as common criminals are known
 as "plantados" and are subject to particular abuse. They
 spend their days dressed only in pajamas or underwear, or
 without any clothing at all. Visits by friends or relatives
 are limited to one or two per year, or less, and letters to
 one per month. Political prisoners are not routinely released
 at the end of their terms; whether they are freed depends on a
 personal decision by Fidel Castro, who has frequently used the
 release of political prisoners to gain favor with an
 influential foreign visitor or to put the latter under
 obligation to "respond." The 1985 Amnesty International
 Report expressed concern about the Government's practice of
 not releasing long-term political prisoners who had completed
 their sentences.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Arrests are often carried out without warrants. Those
 arrested can be detained for long.periods without judicial
 hearings. As indicated by Article 61 of the Cuban
 Constitution, legal protections cannot be invoked to prevent
 the State from arresting and detaining anyone, including
 placing in incommunicado detention, whom the political
 
 
 485
 CUBA
 authorities consider harmful to the "decision of the Cuban
 people to build socialism and communism." People arrested for
 vandalism, practicing certain religions, or criticizing the
 regime can be charged with sabotage and counterrevolutionary
 activities.
 In July 1984, Amado Rodriguez, a former long-term political
 prisoner, was rearrested and held incommunicado until
 sentenced in March 1985 to an additional 15 years in prison.
 Originally imprisoned in 1961 at the age of 18, Rodriguez had
 served 18 years of a 30-year sentence. Currently held in the
 infamous Boniato prison in eastern Cuba, he reportedly has
 been subjected to physical and psychological torture and has
 been denied medicine and medical care. His case was brought
 to the attention of the Inter-American Human Rights Commission
 in August 1985.
 Once political prisoners are freed, they are sometimes
 forbidden to leave Cuba. Poet Angel Cuadra Landrove, who was
 released in April 1982, was not able to depart Cuba until
 1985. Ricardo Bofill Pages, Chairman of the Cuban Committee
 on Human Rights, was released from his second term in prison
 in August 1985 but still awaits permission to depart the
 country. While waiting for exit permits, former political
 prisoners sometimes are denied the right to work, possess
 ration cards, and obtain basic identification documents. In
 its 1984 report, the International Labor Organization (ILO)
 noted that Cuban law can be used by the Government as a means
 of direct or indirect compulsion to work and urged that the
 law be amended to bring it into conformity with the Convention
 on Forced Labor.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Although Cuban courts are described constitutionally as
 "independent," in practice they are subordinated to the Party
 through the National Assembly of the People's Power, a rubber
 stamp body that meets twice annually for a few days, and to
 the Council of State. All civil courts are presided over by a
 five-person panel of judges. Three are professionally
 qualified; the other two are "workers' representatives" who
 see that the "interests of the revolution" are protected.
 People accused of certain counterrevolutionary activities are
 tried and sentenced secretly by military tribunals. Although
 defense lawyers are theoretically available to all defendants,
 attorneys have been jailed for defending individuals charged
 with political offenses. One of those attorneys, Aramis
 Taboada, died in a prison hospital in November 1985, under
 unexplained circumstances.
 Only the Cuban Government knows the exact number of political
 prisoners in Cuba. Fidel Castro told foreign journalists in
 February 1985 that "political prisoners, . . . the
 recalcitrant ones who once numbered many thousands, amount to
 about 200. . ." Castro, who has no reason to exaggerate, also
 stated that the total number of individuals "sentenced for
 counterrevolutionary activities" could be as many as 1,000.
 Americas Watch and Amnesty International have published
 estimates that the number is between 250 and 1,000. Some
 political prisoners released in June 1984 contend the total is
 in fact nearer 10,000. A 1985 survey by Amnesty International
 of other human rights organizations drew responses indicating
 that there may be as many as 15,000 political prisoners in
 Cuba, though Amnesty International itself did not endorse that
 
 
 486
 CUBA
 number. Few of the political prisoners have been involved in
 violence against the Government.
 In January 1985, a delegation from the U.S. Catholic Bishops
 Conference asked for the release of 140 long-term political
 prisoners, after which the Cuban Government offered to release
 75 persons--the majority of them neither on the list of 140
 nor known to the Catholic Church--and allow them and their
 families to leave Cuba for the United States. The necessary
 steps to establish their eligibility for resettlement are
 presently in progress. Meanwhile, as of January 1986 all but
 a few of these persons are still in prison.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Family life is complicated in Cuba by educational practices,
 which often separate children from their parents and teach
 that the State's interests have priority over family ties.
 Further disruption is caused by severe housing shortages,
 rationing, and strong pressures to participate in "voluntary"
 Communist Party-related activities. Parents fear, rightly,
 that teaching their children religious practices, even in
 their homes, will harm their careers. Nearly all families
 must send their teen-aged children on 45-day stints of
 voluntary work" in rural areas. The children are kept in
 camps, where they are indoctrinated with party ideology and
 encouraged to inform on their parents and friends.
 Few aspects of an ordinary Cuban's private life are free from
 state surveillance. Telephones are tapped and mail is
 opened. Daily life is closely monitored by the Committees for
 the Defense of the Revolution (CDR) that exist on virtually
 every block in Cuban municipalities, and in which membership
 is essentially mandatory. As a CDR member explained in a
 documentary film done by a Cuban exile in Cuba in 1983/84,
 members are expected to observe and report anything "unusual,"
 including strangers (especially foreigners) in the
 neighborhood, reception of foreign radio and television
 broadcasts, conspicuous consumption, unauthorized meetings, or
 critical comments about the Government. Cubans overheard by
 neighbors reportedly have been fined for speaking
 disparagingly of Castro in their homes. According to recent
 exiles, the Cuban people generally resent this type of
 violation of their human rights even more than economic
 deprivation or political indoctrination.
 Listening to foreign radio and television broadcasts is
 discouraged. A shrill hum is transmitted to interfere with
 broadcasts of the voice of America's Cuba service ("Radio
 Marti program"). Some Miami radio stations are also jammed.
 Non-Communist foreign periodicals are rarely permitted to
 circulate in Cuba.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 There is no freedom of speech or press in Cuba; all media are
 controlled by the State and are used for the purpose of
 indoctrination and dissemination of propaganda. They publish
 or broadcast nothing that is not in consonance with the party
 line. There are credible reports that broadcasters have been
 dismissed or punished for casual comments, such as making a
 
 
 487
 CUBA
 sarcastic comment about the artistic merit of East European
 "children's cartoons" shown on Cuban television. Intellectual
 expression is limited to activities that do not contradict
 government policy lines.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Freedom of assembly and association are not guaranteed by the
 Constitution and are actively discouraged. Any group meeting
 is almost certain to be monitored by the CDR or state security
 representatives. All associations are party or government-
 controlled and most are party- or government-initiated. The
 few private associations exist at the sufferance of the
 Government and at the risk of the associates.
 Cuban workers are required to belong to the officially
 sponsored Confederation of Cuban Workers (CTC). The CTC is a
 member of the ILO as well as the World Federation of Trade
 Unions (WFTU). It is not in fact an independent trade union
 but rather a mass organization under government and party
 control. It automatically supports any and all government
 political initiatives. In January 1983, five organizers of an
 independent trade union reportedly were sentenced to death for
 their activities, although their sentences were later commuted
 to 30 years imprisonment. Two hundred other would-be
 independent trade unionists received lesser sentences in this
 instance. A judge who questioned the severity of these
 sentences was herself sentenced to serve 18 years in a prison
 labor camp.
 There is no collective bargaining and the right to strike is
 not recognized.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 In one of several noteworthy developments in church-
 state relations in 1985, a religious affairs office was
 established within the Central Committee of the Cuban
 Communist Party, headed by an official who long has had
 similar responsibilities in the Government. The Government
 also announced that foreign rabbis would be allowed to visit
 and perform religious ceremonies. Fidel Castro met in January
 1985 with a delegation from the U.S. Catholic Bishops
 Conference and in September with the Cuban Catholic bishops.
 These few steps have been accompanied by efforts of the
 Government to obtain the church's endorsement for its views on
 extraneous issues, such as the foreign debt of Latin American
 countries. These developments have also been at random and
 have yet to be reflected in any genuine relaxation of controls
 on free religious expression.
 Despite a Cuban constitutional guarantee, Cubans who practice
 their religion still face discrimination. Religious groups
 must register with the Government. Religious materials may
 not be distributed freely in Cuba. Religious belief is not
 compatible with membership in the ruling Cuban Communist
 Party, thus virtually excluding religious Cubans from all
 important positions in the Government.
 No provision is made to respect the beliefs of Seventh Day
 Adventists who object to compulsory work and school attendance
 on Saturday. No exception to military service is made for
 conscientious objectors. There are reports that those who
 refuse to serve for religious reasons will be jailed until
 
 
 488
 CUBA
 they either recant or have been imprisoned for at least two to
 three times longer than others who fail to fulfill their
 military obligation.
 Members of the CDR's monitor attendance at the few
 neighborhood churches still open, forcing churchgoers to go to
 large downtown churches where they can remain anonymous.
 Participation in Communist youth activities is strongly
 encouraged. Religious and other private elementary and
 secondary schools as well as universities are not permitted.
 In September 1985, a small delegation from the Cuban Catholic
 Bishops Conference was allowed to visit its counterpart in the
 United States. Other clergy and lay officials of Protestant
 (particularly those associated with the Cuban Ecumenical
 Council) as well as Catholic churches are usually granted
 permission to travel abroad on church matters. Membership in
 Jehovah's Witnesses is prohibited, however, and persons
 identified with that denomination are denied permission to
 travel abroad. International contacts of all Cuban churches
 are carefully monitored by the security apparatus.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Domestic travel is unrestricted by law, and Cubans are
 permitted to change their jobs and residences. In contrast,
 permission is required both to leave and to re-enter the
 country. Until recently, nonofficial foreign travel was
 generally limited to rare cases of special humanitarian
 concern (e.g., people with critically ill relatives abroad),
 clergy or lay officials on church business, women over 60
 years of age, and men over 65 years of age. Travel by these
 last two groups has now been severely curtailed.
 Emigration is strictly controlled, and those who apply to
 leave may lose their jobs, houses, and ration books.
 Moreover, their children may be refused further schooling. In
 some cases the would-be emigrants are physically and verbally
 abused. Draft-age males and professionals are usually not
 permitted to emigrate. Some professionals have reported that
 the Government will allow them to emigrate only if they pay
 tens of thousands of dollars, ostensibly to reimburse the
 Government for the cost of their education. Those who are
 permitted to emigrate must leave behind almost all their
 personal and household possessions and are forced to pay
 discriminatory air fares. They must also pay exorbitant fees
 for travel documents. These fees must be paid in hard
 currency, which by law is not available to Cuban citizens;
 hence it must be obtained from relatives or friends abroad.
 On December 14, 1984, Cuba and the United States signed an
 agreement under which Cuba would allow the re-entry of 2,746
 Cuban citizens found to be excludable from the United States,
 and the United States would reinstitute processing of Cuban
 applications to immigrate to the United States. In May 1985,
 Cuba unilaterally suspended the agreement, thus preventing the
 reunification of thousands of families, many of which have
 been separated for years or even decades. The Cuban
 Government has also restricted the travel of individuals
 resident in the United States who wish to visit their
 relatives in Cuba, except for "strictly humanitarian
 purposes." Such travel declined greatly thereafter.

 CUBA
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Cuba is a one-party Communist state firmly controlled by the
 Cuban Communist Party, which in turn is dominated by Fidel
 Castro. Members of the Central Committee and the Politburo
 are selected by a narrow circle of Party rulers; elections
 simply ratify choices already made. The National Assembly of
 People's Power meets briefly twice a year, solely to endorse
 decisions already made by the Party chiefs. No political
 opposition is permitted in Cuba; dissidents are either in jail
 or outside the country. There is no legal way for citizens to
 change the Government; as a result hundreds of thousands of
 Cubans have fled their country, and many others would do so if
 it were not so dangerous.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government routinely denies that there are any violations
 of human rights in the country, and it refuses permission for
 any outside organization to investigate its claims. It
 refused to permit investigators from the Inter-American Human
 Rights Commission to visit Cuba, and it told the ILO that "No
 one in Cuba is under arrest for trade union or labor
 activities," a patently false assertion. The ILO's Committee
 on Freedom of Association was considering an International
 Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) complaint alleging
 the arrest and imprisonment of striking Cuban workers, as well
 as of workers trying to organize an independent trade union.
 It was forced to drop the matter in 1984 when it became clear
 that the Cuban Government's complete control over information
 prevented further investigation.
 Although the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC)
 helped Cuba arrange the repatriation of its nationals from
 Grenada in November 1983, the ICRC has been refused access to
 Cuban jails or permission to visit political prisoners.
 Americas Watch and Amnesty International have also been
 refused such access. The few human rights activists who are
 not in jail are forced to carry out their activities
 clandestinely, and they must rely upon international
 nongovernmental organizations for support and publicity.
 The Government also severely limits the ability of foreign
 journalists to report on human rights violations or on any
 other matter that may reflect poorly on the regime. Fidel
 Castro has boasted about how carefully foreign journalists are
 kept under surveillance in Cuba. In 1983 two French
 journalists were arrested and detained for 10 days and then
 expelled from Cuba because they met with Cuban human rights
 activist Ricardo Bofill Pages. Bofill was also arrested and
 spent 2 years in prison. More recently, the Agence France
 Press correspondent in Cuba was expelled for writing an
 article on a Cuban law firm--an agency of the Government--that
 extracts large payments for exit permits for Cubans married to
 foreigners. The Government asserted that the facts the
 journalists had disclosed about this practice were insulting
 to Cuban womanhood. Even abroad, Cuban human rights activists
 are harassed. The office of the "Committee for Human Rights
 in Cuba" in Madrid was robbed in October 1985. The thieves
 stole files, including membership lists, money, and recording
 material. According to media reporting, the head of the
 
 
 490
 CUBA
 committee, Armando Vallardares, believes that the crime was
 political.
 Amnesty International Report 1985 expressed concern about
 long-term political prisoners who were held after expiry of
 their sentences, as well as the imprisonment of prisoners of
 conscience, including persons reportedly detained for
 attempting to exercise their right to leave the country.
 Freedom House rated Cuba "not free."
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 Cuba's population of 10,430,164 is growing at an annual rate
 of 0.99 percent, according to the Communist party daily
 Granma. Although Cuba claims a per capita gross social
 product of approximately $2,500, actual per capita disposable
 national income is only about $1,500. In 1950 Cuba ranked
 third in Latin America in per capita income, had a high
 literacy rate, and provided comparatively good medical care
 for its population. The Castro regime thus had a rather
 well-developed infrastructure upon which to build. The
 country now ranks around 18th in per capita income, although
 it claims the highest literacy rate in Latin America. Some
 progress has been made in medical care, especially in
 preventive medicine.
 Cuba's economy is centrally planned. It receives an estimated
 $4 billion annually in economic assistance from the Soviet
 Union, to which it now owes the soft currency equivalent of
 $9-$23 billion. Its current debt to Western creditors exceeds
 $3 billion. Basic necessities are scarce, and items such as
 rice, beans, meat, clothing, and shoes are rationed. Some
 rationed items and other consumer goods are available at very
 high prices on the government-operated "parallel market,"
 created by the Government to absorb excess currency and
 counteract black market activities. The latter continues to
 function, presumably tolerated by authorities as an additional
 means of acquiring hard currency from foreigners or for
 satisfying consumer demands.
 Cuban government statistics show life expectancy now at 74.2
 years, and infant mortality at 15 per 1,000 live births.
 According to these official Cuban figures, the adult literacy
 rate in 1979 was 95.7 percent for males and 95.1 percent for
 females. In 1975, 96 percent of the urban population had
 access to safe water, according to official Cuban claims.
 However, disorders of a gastrointestinal nature have been
 fairly widespread. Caloric supply as a percentage of average
 requirements in 1977 was 116.9, according to Cuban figures.
 Reflecting the Government's emphasis on basic education, the
 adjusted primary school enrollment (1982), as a percentage of
 children of primary school age was stated as 112 percent for
 males and 109 percent for females.
 The standard Cuban work week is 44 hours, consisting of 8
 hours each weekday and 8 hours every other Saturday. The
 minimum monthly wage is 86 pesos per month. All workers
 receive 1 month of annual vacation. Cubans do not normally
 begin working before the age of 17 although under some
 circumstances they may begin working at age 14. Under age 17
 they are legally not permitted to work in hazardous conditions
 or for more than 7 hours a day or 40 hours a week. However,
 students as young as 12 are required to spend 6 weeks a year
 performing light agricultural work, such as harvesting fruit,
 
 
 491
 CUBA
 for which they receive no wages. Provisions for worker safety
 and control of industrial pollution are fairly well developed
 although substantially below standards of the industrialized
 West.
 Although Cuba constitutionally has outlawed discrimination
 against women and minorities, few women hold high positions in
 government and the Party. Of the 225 full and alternate
 members of the Central Committee selected in December 1980, 18
 are women. One Politburo member, an alternate, is a woman (a
 sister-in-law of President Fidel Castro). One woman (the wife
 of a key member of the Secretariat of the Communist Party) has
 reached the rank of colonel in the Cuban Armed Forces.
 Although women make up 37 percent of the work force and 53.8
 percent of the technical workers, there is no woman on the
 National Committee of the Confederation of Cuban Workers.
 Blacks and other minorities are poorly represented in the top
 levels of government. While they comprise more than one
 quarter of the population (a greater percentage if mulattos
 are included), their representation on the Central Committee
 (full and alternate members) is about 10 to 15 percent. Only
 one of the members of the Politburo (full or alternate) is
 black.
