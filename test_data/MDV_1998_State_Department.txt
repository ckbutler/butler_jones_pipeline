 MALDIVES
 The Republic of Maldives comprises 1,190 islands scattered across an area 500
 miles long by 75 miles wide in the Indian Ocean. Less than 200 of the islands are
 inhabited. The population is approximately 260,000 persons. The Maldives has a
 parliamentary form of government with a very strong executive. The President ap-
 points the Cabinet, members of the judiciary, and one-sixth of the Parliament. The
 President derives additional influence from his constitutional role as the protector
 of Islam. Political parties are officially discouraged, and candidates for the unicam-
 eral legislature, the Citizens' Majlis, run as individuals. The Majls selects a single
 p residential nominee who is approved or rejected in a national referendum. The
 Majlis must approve all legislation and can enact legislation without presidential
 
 
 1916
 
 approval. Civil law is subordinate to Islamic law, but civil law is generally applied
 in criminal and civil cases. The judiciary is subject to executive influence.
 The National Security Service (NSS) performs its duties under effective civilian
 control. The NSS includes the armed forces and police, and its members serve in
 both police and military capacities during their careers. The police division inves-
 tigates crimes, collects intelligence, makes arrests, and enforces house arrest.
 Fishing, small-scale agriculture, and tourism provide employment for over one-
 half of the work force. Tourism accounts for over one-quarter of government reve-
 nues and roughly "40 percent of foreign exchange receipts. Manufacturing accounts
 for 6 percent of gross domestic product.
 The Government restricts human rights in several areas. The Majlis assumed a
 more active political role, and its members routinely differ with government policy
 on many issues. However, the President's power to appoint a significant portion of
 the Parliament still constrains citizens' ability to change their government. An eas-
 ing of government restrictions and the Press Council's balanced handling of issues
 related to journalistic standards allowed a greater diversity of views in the media.
 Nevertheless, the Government banned a book in September 1997 because it con-
 tained derogatory comments about a previous president. The Government limits
 freedom of assembly and association. There are significant restrictions on the free-
 dom of religion, including the arbitrary detention and expulsion of foreigners for
 proselytizing and the detention of citizens who convert. Women face a variety of
 legal and social disadvantages. Some of these restrictions are linked to the Govern-
 ment's observance of Shari'a (Islamic law) and other Islamic customs. The Govern-
 ment restricts worker rights. Nonetheless, there was some progress in certain areas,
 as the courts were reorganized in 1997. A new Constitution, which provides for the
 protection of certain fundamental rights, went into effect at the beginning of the
 year. In addition, procedural rules limiting indefinite police detention were insti-
 tuted, and the presidential nominating process involved competition among can-
 didates for the first time.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and- Other Extrajudicial Klling.-There were no reports of political or
 other extrajudicial killings.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 There were no reports of beatings or other mistreatment of persons in police cus-
 tody; however, convicted criminals may be flogged under judicial supervision when
 this punishment is prescribed by Islamic law (i.e., only when the criminal confesses
 to the crime and only for the offenses of marital infidelity and alcohol abuse). There
 were no public floggings during the year, but there were two private floggings due
 to the, confession of an extramarital affair. The man was subsequently banished, and
 the woman was placed under house arrest for 12 months. Punishments are usually
 confined to fines, compensatory payment, house arrest, imprisonment, or banish-
 ment to a remote atoll. The Government generally permits those who are banished
 to receive visits by family members.
 Prison conditions, including food and prisoner housing, are adequate. Prisoners
 are allowed to work in prison and given the opportunity for regular exercise and
 recreation. Spouses are allowed privacy during visits with incarcerated partners.
 The Government has permitted prison visits by foreign diplomats.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The 1968 Constitution states that no per-
 son shall be apprehended, except on a verdict specified by Shari'a or civil law; how-
 ever, authorities arbitrarily detained foreigners for allegedly proselytizing Christian-
 ity and detained citizens who supposedly converted (see Section 2.c.). Police initiate
 investigations based on suspicion of criminal activity or in response to written com-
 plaints from citizens, police officers, or government officials. They are not required
 to obtain warrants for arrests. Based on the results of police investigations, the At-
 torney General refers cases to the appropriate court. The authorities generally keep
 the details of a case confidential until they are confident that the charges will be
 upheld.
 Depending on the charges, a suspect may remain free, detained in prison, or
 under house arrest for 15 days during investigations. The President may extend pre-
 trial detention for an additional 30 days, but in most cases the suspect is released
 if not brought to trial within 15 days. Those who are released pending trial may
 not leave a specific atoll. The law providing for the indefinite detention of individ-
 uals under investigation was revised substantially in 1998. Within 24 hours of an
 arrest, an individual must be told of the grounds for the arrest. An individual can
 
 
 1917
 
 then be held for 7 days. If no legal proceedings have been initiated within 7 days,
 the case is referred to an anonymous three-member civilian commission appointed
 by the President that can authorize an additional 15 days' detention. After that
 time, if legal proceedings still have not been initiated, a judge must sanction the
 continued detention on a monthly basis. There is no right to legal counsel during
 police interrogation. There is no provision for bail.
 The Government may prohibit access to a telephone and nonfamily visits to those
 under house arrest. While there have been no reported cases of incommunicado de-
 tention in recent years, the law does not provide safeguards against this abuse.
 The Government detained three individuals in April 1995 that remained under
 house arrest without charge until October 1995, when their detention was lifted. No
 charges were brought against them. The Government has offered no reasons for
 their detention. It is widely believed, however, that their detention was the result
 of political differences with the Government rather than due to any threat that the
 men-all of whom are elderly and well known figures-pose to national security. Ac-
 cording to an Amnesty International (AI) report in June, Ismail Saadiq, a Maldivian
 businessman, was taken into police custody for political reasons in Male and later
 detained because he had allegedly been in contact with a British Broadcasting Com-
 pany (BBC) reporter. According to AI, he had previously been under house arrest
 or alleged business irregularities, and was told that the media contact violated
 house arrest rules. At year's end, the details surrounding Saadiq's reported deten-
 tion could not be confirmed.
 There were no reports of the external exile of Maldivian citizens, although 24 for-
 eigners suspected of proselytization were banished for life (see Section 2.c.). The
 Government sometimes banishes convicted criminals to inhabited atolls away from
 their home communities; a man who confessed to an extramarital affair in April was
 banished for 1 year.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The 1968 Constitution does not provide for an
 independent judiciary. The judiciary is subject to executive influence. In addition to
 his authority to review High Court decisions, the President influences the judiciary
 through his power to appoint and dismiss judges, all of whom serve at his pleasure
 and are not subject to confirmation by the Majlis. The President has nevertheless
 removed only two judges since 1987. Both dismissals followed the recommendation
 of the Justice Ministry which found the judges' professional qualifications to be
 below standard. The President may also grant pardons and amnesties.
 In September 1997 the court system, under the Ministry of Justice, was reorga-
 nized and court administration has improved. There are three courts: One for civil
 matters; one for criminal cases; and one for family and juvenile issues. On the rec-
 ommendation of the Ministry of Justice, the President appoints a principal judge for
 each court. There is also a High Court on Male, which is independent of the Justice
 Ministry and which handles a wide range of cases, including politically sensitive
 ones, and acts as a court of appeals. Under a 1995 presidential decree, High Court
 rulings can be reviewed by a 5-member advisory council appointed by the President.
 The President also has authority to affirm judgments of the High Court, order a sec-
 ond hearing, or overturn the Court's decision. In addition to the Male courts, there
 are 204 general courts on the islands.
 There are no jury trials. Most trials are public and are conducted by judges and
 magistrates trained in Islamic, civil, and criminal law. Magistrates usually adju-
 dicate cases on outer islands, but when more complex legal questions are involved,
 the Justice Ministry will send more experienced judges to handle the case.
 During a trial, the accused may defend himself, call witnesses, and be assisted
 by a lawyer. Courts do not provide lawyers to indigent defendants. Judges question
 the concerned parties and attempt to establish the facts of a case.
 Civil law is subordinate to Islamic law, or Shari'a. Shari'a is applied in situations
 not covered by civil law as well as in certain acts such as divorce and adultery.
 Courts adjudicating matrimonial and criminal cases generally do not allow legal
 counsel in court because, according to a local interpretation of Shari'a, all answers
 and submissions should come directly from the parties involved. However, the High
 Court allows legal counsel in all cases, including those in which the right to counsel
 was denied in the lower court. Under Islamic practice, the testimony of two women
 is required to equal that of one man in matters involving finance and inheritance.
 In other cases, the testimony of men and women are equal.
 Ilyas Ibrahim, the Presidents chief rival for the 1993 presidential nomination,
 and a relative of the president, was tried in absentia in 1994 and sentenced to 15
 years' banishment on the charge of illegally attempting to become President and to
 6 months banishment for violating his oath as minister. Ilyas returned from his self-
 imposed foreign exile in 1996 and was placed under house arrest for several months.
 The President has since pardoned him, and there are no restrictions on his political
 
 
 1918
 rights. In November President Gayoom appointed Ilyas to the Cabinet as Minister
 of Transport and Civil Aviation.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 1968 Constitution prohibits security officials from opening or reading letters, tele-
 grams, and wireless messages or monitoring telephone conversations, "except in ac-
 cordance with the specific provisions of the law." The NSS may open the mail of
 private citizens and monitor telephone conversations if authorized in the course of
 a criminal investigation.
 Although the 1968 Constitution requires the authorities to respect private prem-
 ises and dwellings, there is no legal requirement for search or arrest warrants. The
 Attorney General or a commanding officer of the police must approve the search of
 private residences.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-Law No. 4/68 of 1968 prohibits public state-
 ments that are contrary to Islam, threaten the public order, or are libelous. In April
 1996, a journalist was sentenced under this law to 2 years' imprisonment for com-
 ments made about the 1994 general elections in an article published in the Phil-
 ippines. On appeal the High Court reduced his sentence to 6 months. The President
 pardoned the journalist at the beginning of 1997.
 The Penal Code prohibits inciting the people against the Government. However,
 a 1990 amendment to the Penal Code decriminalized "any true account of any act
 of commission or omission past or present by the Government in a lawfully reg-
 istered newspaper or magazine, so as to reveal dissatisfaction or to effect its re-
 form.,
 The Press Council established by the Government in December 1993 is composed
 of official government and private media representatives, lawyers, and government
 officials. The Council reviews charges of journalist misconduct (advising the Min-
 istry of Information, Arts, and Culture on measures to be taken against reporters,
 when appropriate) and promotes the professional standards within the media (rec-
 ommending reforms and making suggestions for improvement). In 1998, the Press
 Council organized a 6-month training program for 12 journalists to improve media
 reporting and accuracy. The Council met regularly, and private journalists were sat-
 isfied with its objectivity and performance. Regulations that made publishers re-
 sponsible for the content of the material they published remained in effect but did
 not result in any legal actions. The Government agreed that private journalists,
 rather than the Government, should take responsibility for preparation of a journal-
 istic code of ethics. Individual newspapers and journals established their own ethical
 guidelines in many cases. The Government has not amended regulations that make
 publishers responsible for the content of the material they publish, despite reports
 in 1994 that'the regulations were under review and a change was likely.
 There were no reports of government censorship of the electronic media, nor were
 there closures of any publications or reports of intimidation of journalists. The Gov-
 ernment banned a book written by an elderly close relative of the President for its
 derogatory comments about a deceased previous president, after the relatives of the
 latter complained. No journalists were arrested during the year. The Government
 discontinued its practice of providing reporting guidelines to the media in 1994.
 Television news and public affairs programming routinely discussed topics of cur-
 rent concern and freely criticized government performance. Regular press con-
 ferences instituted with government ministers in 1995 continued. Journalists are
 more self-confident than in the past; self-censorship appears to have diminished, al-
 though it remains a problem. Since it is not clear when criticism violates Law 41
 68, journalists and publishers continue to watch what they say, particularly on po-
 litical topics, to avoid entanglement with the Government.
 The Government owns and operates the only television and radio station. It does
 not interfere with foreign broadcasts or the sale of satellite receivers. Reports drawn
 from foreign newscasts are aired on the Government television station.
 Cable News Network (CNN) is shown, uncensored, daily on local television. In
 1996 a company began providing Internet services, The Government enacted no reg-
 ulations governing Internet access but does seek to block distribution of porno-
 graphic material via Internet.
 Although 88 newspapers and.periodicals are registered with the Government, only
 about 60 regularly publish. Aafathis, a morning daily, is published by the brother
 of the President s principal political rival, Ilyas Ibrahim, and is often critical of gov-
 ernment policy. Another daily, Miadhu, began publishing in 1996, and Haveeru is
 the evening daily. Both Miadhu's and Haveeru's publishers are progovernment.
 
 
 1919
 There are no legal prohibitions on the import of foreign publications except those
 containing pornography or material otherwise deemed objectionable to Islamic val-
 ues. No seizures of foreign publications were reported during the year. There are
 no reported restrictions on academic freedom. Some teachers are reportedly vocal in
 their criticism of the Government.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The 1968 Constitution pro-
 vides for the right to freedom of assembly, as long as the law or the Islamic code
 of behavior is upheld. The Home Ministry permits public political meetings during
 electoral campaigns but limits them to small gatherings on private premises.
 The Government registers clubs and other private associations if they do not con-
 travene Islamic or civil law. While not forbidden by law, the President officially dis-
 courages political parties on the grounds that they are inappropriate to the homo-
 geneous nature of society. However, many Majlis members were active and out-
 spoken critics of the Government and have stimulated closer parliamentary exam-
 ination of government policy.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-Freedom of religion is significantly restricted. The 1968
 Constitution designates Islam as the official religion and requires all citizens to be
 Muslims. The practice of any religion other than Islam is prohibited by law. How-
 ever, foreign residents are allowed to practice their religion if they do so privately.
 There are no places of worship for adherents of other religions. The Government
 prohibits the importation of icons and religious statues. It also prohibits non-Muslim
 clergy and missionaries from proselytizing and conducting public worship services.
 Conversion of a Muslim to another faith is a violation of Shar'a and may result in
 a loss of the convert's citizenship. In April the Government asked the Seychelles
 Government to stop the radio broadcast of Christian programming in the local
 Maldivian language, Dhiveli, to the Maldives. The broadcasts continued throughout
 the year. During the summer, the authorities detained 24 foreigners (including chil-
 dren) for alleged Christian proselytization without explaining the charges against
 them, and then expelled them from the country for life. Following the expulsion of
 the foreigners, police took two women into custody for allegedly converting to Chris-
 tianity. As many as a dozen other citizens were questioned. The women were de-
 tained from mid-June to late September, during which time they received extensive
 counseling. No formal charges were-ever brought against them, and they were re-
 leased to their families.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-Citizens are free to travel at home and abroad, emigrate, and return.
 Because of overcrowding, the Government discourages migration into the capital is-
 land of Male or its surrounding atoll. Foreign workers are often kept at their work-
 sites. Their ability to travel freely is restricted, and they are not allowed to mingle
 with the local population on the islands. The issue of the provision of first asylum
 did not arise during the year. The Government has not formulated a policy regard-
 ing first asylum. There were no reports of forced expulsion of those having a valid
 claim to refugee status.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens' ability to change their government is constrained, as a strong executive
 exerts significant influence over both the legislature and the judiciary. Under the
 new Constitution, the Majls chooses a single presidential nominee who must be a
 Sunni Muslim male from a list of self-announced candidates for the nomination.
 Would-be nominees for President are not permitted to campaign for the nomination.
 The nominee is then confirmed or rejected by secret ballot in a nationwide referen-
 dum. From a field of five candidates for the nomination, President Gayoom was
 nominated by the Majlis and was confirmed for a fifth 5-year term in October. Ob-
 servers from the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation found the ref-
 erendum to be free and fair.
 The elected members of the Majis serve 5-year terms. All citizens over 21 years
 of age may vote. Of the body's 48 members, 40 are elected-2 from each of the 19
 inhabited atolls and 2 from Male-and the President appoints 8 members. Individ-
 uals or groups are free to approach members of the Majlis with grievances or opin-
 ions on proposed legislation, and any member may introduce legislation. There are
 no political parties, which are officially discouraged.
 The Office of the President is the most powerful political institution. The 1968
 Constitution gives Islamic law preeminence over civil law and designates the Presi-
 dent as the protector of Islam. The President's authority to appoint one-sixth of the
 Majlis members, which is one-third of the total needed for nominating the Presi-
 dent, provides the President with a power base and strong political leverage.
 
 
 1920
 
 Relations between the Government and Majlis have been constructive. The Gov-
 ernment may introduce legislation, but may not enact a bill into law without the
 Majlis' approval. However, the Majlis may enact legislation into law without presi-
 dential assent if the President fails to act on the proposal within 30 days or if a
 bill is re-passed with a two-thirds majority. In recent years, the Majlis has become
 increasingly independent, challenging government policies and rejecting govern-
 ment-proposed legislation.
 In 1993 the Majlis introduced a question time in which members may question
 government ministers about public policy. Debate on the floor has since become in-
 creasingly sharp and more open. The last Majlis election was held in December
 1995. According to South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation observers, the
 elections were generally free and fair. Irregularities were observed and repolling re-
 quired in one of 29 constituencies. Over 200 candidates campaigned freely for 40
 seats.
 Women are not eligible to become president but may hold other government posts.
 For reasons of tradition and culture, few women seek or are selected for public of-
 fice. Three women serve in the Majlis and one in the Cabinet. In order to increase
 participation by women in the political process, the Government launched a political
 awareness campaign in the outer atolls in November.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Although not prohibited, there are no active local human rights groups. The Gov-
 - ernment has been responsive to at least one foreign government's interest in exam-
 ining human rights issues. The Government also facilitated visits of teams of South
 Asian Association for Regional Cooperation election observers in 1994 and 1998.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The 1968 Constitution declares all citizens equal before the law, but there is no
 specific provision to prohibit discrimination based on these factors. Women have tra-
 ditionally been disadvantaged, particularly in terms of education and the application
 of Islamic law to matters such as divorce, inheritance, and testimony in legal pro-
 ceedings.
 Women.-There are no firm data on the extent of violence against women because
 of the value attached to privacy in this conservative society. The Government com-
 missioned a study in 1997 from a local nongovernmental organization (NGO) on do-
 mestic violence, but the results were still not available by year's end. Police officials
 report that they receive few complaints of assaults against women. Women's rights
 advocates agree that wife beating and other forms of violence are not widespread.
 Rape and other violent crimes against women are rare. None were reported or pros-
 ecuted during the year.
 Women traditionally have played a subordinate role in society, although they now
 participate in public life in growing numbers and gradually are participating at
 higher levels. Well-educated women maintain that cultural norms, not the law, in-
 hibit women's education and career choices. In many instances, education for girls
 is curtailed after the seventh grade, largely because parents do not allow girls to
 leave their home island for an island having a secondary school. Due largely to or-
 thodox Islamic training, there is a strong strain of conservative sentiment-espe-
 cially among small businessmen and residents of the outer islands-which opposes
 an active role for women outside the home. The Government has undertaken legal
 literacy programs to make women aware of their legal rights.
 Under Islamic practice, husbands may divorce their wives more easily than vice
 versa, absent any mutual agreement to divorce. Islamic law also governs inherit-
 ance, granting male heirs twice the share of female heirs. A woman's testimony is
 equal to only one-half of that of a man in matters involving finance and inheritance
 (see Section i.e.). Women who work for wages receive pay equal to that of men in
 the same positions. About 10 per cent of uniformed NSS personnel are women.
 Children.-The Government does not have a program of compulsory education.
 The percentage of school-age children actually in school is as follows: (grades 1-5)
 99.26 percent, (grades 6-7) 96.2 percent, and grades (8-10) 51.09 percent. Of the
 students enrolled 49.21 percent are female and 50.79 percent are male. The Govern-
 ment is committed to protection of children's rights and welfare. Government policy
 provides, for equal access to educational and health programs for both male and fe-
 male children. Laws protecting children's rights apply with equal force to children
 of either sex.
 Children's rights are incorporated into law, which specifically protects children
 from both physical and psychological abuse, including abuse at the hands of teach-
 
 
 1921
 ers or parents. The Ministry of Women's Affairs and Social Welfare has the author-
 ity to enforce this law, takes its responsibility seriously, and has received strong
 popular support for its efforts. The Government is reviewing this law to see if im-
 provements and additional protections are necessary. There is no reported societal
 pattern of abuse directed against children.
 People With Disabilities.-There is no law that specifically addresses the rights
 of the physically or mentally disabled. However, the Government has established
 programs and provided services for the disabled. There is no legislated or mandated
 accessibility for the disabled.
 Persons with disabilities are usually cared for by their families. When such care
 is unavailable, they are kept in the Institute for Needy People. The Government
 provides free medication for all mentally ill persons in the islands, and mobile teams
 regularly visit mentally ill patients.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-While the Government does not expressly prohibit
 unions, it recognizes neither the right to form them nor the right to strike. There
 were no reports of efforts to form unions during the year.
 The work force consists of approximately 64,000 persons, about 20 percent of
 whom are employed in fishing. About 19,900 foreigners work in Maldives, many in
 tourist hotels, factories, or on construction projects. The great majority of workers
 are employed outside the wage sector. The Government estates that the manufac-
 taring sector employs about 15 percent of the labor force and tourism another 10
 percent.
 Workers can affiliate with international labor federations.
 In 1995 the U.S. Government suspended Maldives' eligibility for tariff preferences
 under the U.S. Generalized System of Preferences because the Government failed
 to take steps to afford internationally recognized worker rights to Maldivian work-
 ers.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The law neither prohibits nor
 protects workers' rights to organize and bargain collectively. Wages in the private
 sector are set by contract between employers and employees and are usually based
 on the rates for similar work in the public sector. There are no laws specifically pro-
 hibiting antiunion discrimination by employers against union members or organiz-
 ers. The Government has exerted pressure in the past to discourage seamen from
 joining foreign seamen's unions as a means to secure higher wages. There have been
 no reported complaints alleging such discrimination or claiming government inter-
 ference with workers' attempt to join unions in the past 5 years.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsoy Labor.-Forced or compulsory labor is not
 prohibited by law. However, there were no reports that it is practiced. The Govern-
 ment does not specifically prohibit forced and bonded labor by children, but such
 practices are not known to occur.
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment.-There is
 no compulsory education law, but more than 96 percent of school-age children to
 grade 7 are enrolled in school. A 1992 law bars children under 14 years of age from
 "places of waged works and from work that is not suitable for that child's age,
 health, or physical abffility or that might obstruct the education or adversely affect
 the mentality or behavior of the child." An earlier law prohibits government employ-
 ment of children under the age of 16. There are no reports of children being em-
 ployed in the small industrial sector, although children work in family fishing, agri-
 cultural, and commercial activities. The hours of work of young workers are not spe-
 cifically limited by statute. The Government does not specifically prohibit forced and
 bonded labor by children, but such practices are not known to occur (see Section
 6.c.). A Children's Unit in the Ministry of Women's Affairs and Social Welfare is re-
 sponsible for monitoring compliance with the child labor regulations. It relies upon
 complaints filed with it rather than initiating its own inspections to ensure compli-
 ance. As a result, oversight is incomplete.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-In 1994 the Government promulgated its first
 set of regulations for employer-employee relations. The regulations specify the terms
 that must be incorporated into employment contracts and address such issues as
 training, work hours, safety, remuneration, leave, fines, termination, etc. There is
 no national minimum wage for the private sector, although the Government has es-
 tablished wage floors for certain kinds of work. Given the severe shortage of labor,
 employers must offer competitive pay and conditions to attract skilled workers.
 There are no statutory provisions for hours of work, but the regulations require
 that a work contract specify the normal work and overtime hours on a weekily or
 monthly basis. In the public sector, a 7-hour day and a 5-day workweek have been
 
 
 1922
 
 established through administrative circulars from the President's office. Overtime
 pay in the public sector was instituted in 1990. Employees are authorized 20 days
 of annual leave, 30 days of medical leave, maternity leave of 45 days, and special
 annual leave of 10 days for extraordinary circumstances. There are no laws govern-
 ing health and safety conditions. However, there are regulatory requirements that
 employers provide a safe working environment and ensure the observance of safety
 measures. It is unclear, however, whether workers can remove themselves from un-
 safe working conditions without risking the loss of their jobs. The Ministry of Trade,
 Industries, and Labour set up a Labour Dispute Settlement Unit in 1998 to resolve
 wage and labor disputes and to visit worksites and enforce labor regulations.
 In 1997 the Government for the first time worked closely with the International
 Labor Organization (ILO) to address a number of labor issues, including the right
 of association, the right to organize, and acceptable conditions of work.
