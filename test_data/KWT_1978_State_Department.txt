 KUWAIT
 Long a British protectorate, Kuwait became fully
 independent in 1961. For more than 200 years it has
 been governed by the Al-Sabah family and is led by the
 Amir, a constitutional monarch who traditionally makes
 major government decisions in consultation with other
 members of the ruling family and tribal, business, and
 religious leaders. Kuwait is progressive in providing
 social welfare and civil rights to its citizens.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 Torture is prohibited by the Constitution. The
 Department of State has no evidence that would support
 the allegations of torture recently broadcast from
 Iraq and reported by Amnesty International as noted in
 Section 4 of this report.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 The Department of State has no evidence that these
 practices, which are prohibited by the Constitution,
 exist in Kuwait.
 c. Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 Arbitrary arrest and imprisonment are prohibited by
 the Constitution and, with a few exceptions, are not
 sanctioned in practice by the Kuwait Government. At
 times of tension with neighboring states, Kuwaiti
 authorities sometimes institute nighttime road blocks.
 These are also instituted during periods of internal
 tension reflecting intra-Arab disputes, e.g., between
 the Palestine Liberation Organization and Iraq during
 the summer of 1978. Persons without proper

 'Identification are occasionally detained by the
 police. Several labor unionists who objected publicly
 to the 1976 suspension of those provisions of the
 Constitution dealing with the National Assembly were
 detained briefly, although charges were not pressed.
 d. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Kuwait has a well-developed legal system which
 provides for public trial, right of appeal and repre-
 sentation. The Department of State has no evidence of
 secret or unfair trials. On occasion, however, aliens
 with radical political views have been summarily de-
 ported. In the summer of 1978, approximately twenty
 Palestinians considered by the Kuwaiti Government to
 be members or sympathizers of radical Palestinian
 groups were deported.
 e. Invasion of the Home
 To the knowledge of the Department of State, the
 constitutional prohibition against invasion of the
 home is respected.
 2. Governmental Policies Relating to the Fulfillment
 of Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care
 and Education
 Any examination of social and economic benefits in
 Kuwait must take into consideration the differences in
 treatment of Kuwaiti and non-Kuwaiti citizens. Kuwait
 has spent its large oil revenues (on the order of
 $10 billion per year) on a wide range of programs to
 provide all its citizens with jobs, housing, medical
 care and education. Essentially all these programs,
 including employment, housing, medical care and educa-
 tion through university level for those qualified, are
 provided free for Kuwaiti citizens. The 1978 budget
 of $5.1 billion for domestic expenditure reflects the
 heavy investment in social services and development
 projects. The government has instituted food sub-
 sidies and a modest public housing program for
 
 
 583
 non-Kuwaiti residents. Medical care at nominal cost
 is available to aliens at government facilities.
 Income is widely distributed among Kuwait's citizens,
 largely through commercial laws which hold that a
 Kuwaiti individual or corporate entity must be
 involved in virtually every type of business trans-
 action.
 Kuwaiti citizenship carries with it extensive economic
 and social benefits, but is rarely given to persons of
 other nationalities. Many of the resident Pales-
 tinians, for example, have lived and worked in Kuwait
 for twenty or more years, but do not have any imme-
 diate prospects for enjoying such extra benefits of
 Kuwaiti citizenship as higher government salaries,
 land ownership, pensions and rights to majority
 interest in business ventures.
 In Kuwait, women have equal educational opportunities,
 hold important positions in government (but not at
 the ministerial or deputy ministerial level) and have
 managerial and/or ownership roles in several private
 companies and financial institutions.
 3. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Includ-
 ing:
 a. Freedom of Thought, Speech, Press, Religion
 and Assembly
 Kuwaitis and other residents are generally free to
 speak as they wish. Newspapers are not subject to
 censorship prior to publication, but are subject to
 suspension for violation of laws regarding political
 content. These laws use phrases such as "spread
 dissension," "involved in political matters" and
 "contradict the national interest" to describe the
 grounds for such suspensions. During 1978 several
 newspapers were suspended for periods of a few days up
 to several weeks, usually for attacking leading person-
 alities of friendly Arab states and on one occasion
 
 
 584
 for commenting on the need for and possibility of
 changes in the Kuwaiti Cabinet. Editors are
 criminally liable for violating these laws but to
 date there have been no prosecutions.
 Kuwait recognizes freedom of assembly but the per-
 mission of local authorities is required for rallies
 or demonstrations. The Department of State does not
 know the number of such requests for permission sub-
 mitted to the authorities or the frequency with which
 they are granted or denied. The impression of United
 States officials is that there are few requests and
 most of these are honored.
 There is freedom of worship. Islam is the predominant
 religion, but non-Islamic religions are tolerated.
 However, proselytizing of Muslims by non-Muslims is
 strongly discouraged.
 Labor unions exist but are monitored by the Govern-
 ment. The Government has given union leaders some
 freedom to speak out publicly on issues external to
 Kuwait. For example, they are permitted to criticize
 political developments and labor concerns in other
 countries. The right to strike is recognized by the
 Government and has been exercised in the past two
 years in the banking sector.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel and Emigration
 Kuwaitis and other residents are free to travel inside
 and outside the country and to emigrate. Since
 September 1977, the Government has prohibited the
 participation of national societies, associations and
 trade unions (groups subsidized or authorized by the
 Government) in international meetings-without prior
 approval of the Ministry of Social Affairs and Labor.
 The selection of the delegates to such meetings is sub-
 ject to review by the same Ministry. There have been
 a few cases in 1977 and 1978 in which the Government
 of Kuwait has suspended the passports of intellectuals
 who have publicly citcized the Government while abroad.
 
 
 585
 Non-Kuwaitis working in the country must have the
 sponsorship of Kuwaiti citizens.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 By August of 1976, the ruling family of Kuwait had
 grown increasingly apprehensive about Arab political
 divisions, particularly those affecting Lebanon, which
 threatened to surface in the small city-state. The
 National Assembly and the local press became fora for
 quarreling Arab factions. Several moderate Arab
 regimes were under criticism in National Assembly
 speeches and newspaper columns. There was evidence
 that some Arab governments were paying for media
 attacks on other Arab governments, to the growing
 embarrassment of the Kuwaiti leadership. Kuwait's
 rulers apparently were concerned that the security of
 their country, in which the resident foreign popula-
 tion outnumbers native Kuwaitis, might be undermined.
 The largest segment of resident aliens, Palestinians,
 numbers   about 300,000, and is about two-thirds the
 size of the native Kuwaiti population and thirty
 percent of the total population.
 In late August 1976, the Amir suspended those parts of
 the Constitution dealing with the National Assembly,
 dissolved the Assembly and tightened controls on the
 press. Several newspapers and magazines were suspended
 for periods of one to three months. The Government
 also replaced the leaders of certain professional
 societies. The Istiqlal Club, a political discussion
 group, was disbanded in July 1977.
 There is now no popular elective process for govern-
 ment officials. The Government has proclaimed its
 intent to restore representative government within
 four years. When the National Assembly was in
 existence, only adult male Kuwaiti citizens were
 enfranchised.

 4. Government Attitude and Record Regarding Inter-
 national and Non-governmental Investigation of
 Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 In 1976, Amnesty International reported detailed
 charges that criminal prisoners in Kuwait's central
 prison were "invariably ill-treated and often sub-
 jected to torture." The Government of Kuwait denied
 these allegations in a letter to Amnesty Inter-
 national. In March 1977, Amnesty requested that the
 Government undertake an investigation of the allega-
 tions. To our knowledge, the Government has not
 replied to that request.
