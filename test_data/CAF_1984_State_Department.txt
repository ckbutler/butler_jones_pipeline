 CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC
 General Andre Dieudonne Kolingba has headed the Government of
 the Central African Republic since his accession to power in a
 bloodless coup on September 1, 1981. As head of the Military
 Committee for National Recovery, he holds all political power
 and is the final arbiter of all governmental matters. His
 all-military cabinet of ministers is supplemented by a small
 group of high commissioners who are largely technocrats.
 Political party activities were suspended by Kolingba when he
 took power from David Dacko whose regime (1979-1981) had been
 characterized by politically exacerbated regional and tribal
 cleavages. Prior to that, Emperor Bokassa's control of the
 Government, the armed forces, the judiciary, and the sole
 political party was absolute.
 During 1984 the Government faced less opposition than in prior
 years. A student strike in January, however, led to the
 arrest of several student leaders and several prominent
 political oppositionists.
 The Central African Republic is a poor, landlocked, sparsely
 populated country. Its inhabitants for the most part derive
 their livelihood from subsistence agriculture. Only about one
 percent of the population has had university education. The
 essentially free enterprise agrarian economy, one of the
 world's least monetized, has suffered from inadequately
 coordinated and implemented government policies, occasional
 drought, and a poorly trained work force. Expatriates
 dominate the small manufacturing and commercial sectors of the
 economy. Corruption and abuse of position by public officials
 present additional difficulties. The Government has, however,
 taken some effective if modest steps to reduce corruption and
 increase the efficiency of the bureaucracy.
 The number of political prisoners fluctuated during the year.
 Many were released during the course of the year until the
 fall when several dozen people, some prominent, were arrested
 for reasons that remain unclear. However, on December 31,
 1984, President Kolingba ordered the release of 53 political
 prisoners, including several prominent opposition leaders.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There is no evidence of killings or summary execution for
 political motives by government forces.
 b. Disappearance
 There is no evidence that people have been abducted, secretly
 arrested, clandestinely detained, or that they disappeared as
 a result of government action.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 The penal code prohibits torture and provides for sanctions
 against persons guilty of physical abuse. Nevertheless, there
 
 
 67
 CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC
 are reports of beatings in prisons and of inadequate medical
 attention. Conditions in prisons are poor.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Kolingba's Government has on occasion engaged in arbitrary
 arrest and imprisonment, particularly during its early months
 in power. When people are arrested, in some cases it may be a
 few days before their whereabouts are publicly known. Family
 members, legal counsel, doctors, and ministers of the faith
 have as a rule been given access to prisoners. Amnesty
 International reported that there had been more than 100
 untried political detainees in Kassai camp at the beginning of
 1983, but that 65 had been tried during the year and most of
 the others released uncharged. In 1984, the majority of those
 who were held for political reasons until the December 31,
 1984 amnesty were considered to be major opposition leaders or
 figures capable of stirring up opposition to the regime.
 There are occasional reports of people arrested for simply
 criticizing the regime. In addition to the major political
 prisoners amnestied, a number of minor political prisoners
 were also released on December 31, 1984. It is difficult to
 say how many political detainees still remain since people
 continue to be picked up under suspicion and are only released
 when absolutely no evidence is found against them. Probably
 several dozen political detainees remain.
 Under local law political detainees can be held without charge
 for as long as two months, but at that point detainees must
 either be formally charged or released. If charged, local
 judicial procedures (which are modeled on French procedures)
 allow for open-ended preventive detention while the public
 prosecutor prepares the state's case against the accused.
 Some political detainees are held much longer than two months,
 however, without formal charges being brought against them,
 Neither common criminals nor political prisoners can claim the
 right of habeas corpus. However, a procedure exists requiring
 that within a maximum of 96 hours in the first case and two
 months in the second, a detainee must physically be brought
 before an examining magistrate who considers whether formal
 charges will be filed against the prisoner.
 In January 1984, five political opposition leaders, Messrs.
 Goumba, Maidou, Bozanga, Bomba-Bangabo and Sokambi, were
 placed under house arrest and "exiled" to the interior of the
 country They were accused of inciting the students during
 their strike in protest of the Government's decision to
 establish competitive requirements for university scholarships
 and the civil service. In August 1984, Patrice Endjimoungou,
 secretary general of an illegal political party, was
 rearrested and exiled to the interior of the country for
 allegedly not respecting the political truce he had agreed to
 upon his release from prison in an amnesty granted by the
 President on September 1, 1983. However, President Kolingba
 signed a decree on December 31, 1984 releasing these 6
 opposition leaders along with 47 other political prisoners.
 Another notable released was Joseph Potolot-Ngbanbadimbo,
 former Director General of the Central African Office of
 Social Security and close collaborator of emperor Bokassa. In
 addition, 14 people including some of those condemned by the
 special tribunal for involvement with the March 3, 1982 coup
 attempt had their sentences reduced.
 
 
 CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC
 About a half dozen well-known political opponents live in
 exile. Several have been sentenced to death in absentia for
 crimes against the state ascribed to them.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 In most common criminal cases, the Government permits the
 French-modeled legal procedures to be fairly and openly
 applied and the laws to be properly executed. Within this
 framework, Kolingba granted amnesty to about 100 petty
 criminals in September 1984. The courts are clearly dependent
 on the President. The Constitution, currently in suspension,
 nevertheless states that the judiciary is independent of the
 executive, but that its independence is guaranteed by the
 President.
 A special tribunal comprising civilian magistrates and
 military advisers adjudicates political crimes. The special
 tribunal differs from ordinary courts in that there is no
 appeal except for the possibility of presidential clemency,
 and it can try a case only after being authorized by the
 President. The right of political detainees to counsel is not
 clear. In 1984 the tribunal met to consider the cases of
 persons accused of plotting the March 3, 1982, attempted coup
 d'etat. At least six persons were acquitted, and most of the
 others were given 3- to 8-year prison terms. Two former
 government officials each received 10-year prison terms for
 plotting against the security of the state. Those believed to
 be the instigators of the coup, Messrs. Pattasse, Mbaikou, and
 Bozize, remain in self-imposed exile.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Except for political and security matters, the Government does
 not generally intervene in the private life of citizens.
 There is no forced membership in any political organization;
 there is no interference with the right to marry or have
 children as one chooses; and parents are free to teach their
 children religious practices. The criminal code prohibits the
 invasion of the home without due process, and this right is
 apparently not generally abused in civil and minor criminal
 cases. If a political crime is involved, however, ordinance
 81/035 (which instituted the special tribunal) authorizes
 searches any time, anywhere. These searches have been
 conducted without specific warrant.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The right to speak openly about political developments or to
 criticize the Government is circumscribed. The Government
 prohibits the distribution of tracts and literature deemed to
 be subversive. During 1984 several newspapers started
 publication on an irregular basis. Whether published
 privately or by the Government, they are carefully monitored.
 Both the radio and television are controlled by the
 Government.   The television station was closed down in
 September 1984 by the President due to dissatisfaction with
 the quality of the transmission.

 CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC
 b., Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Only sports enthusiasts and devotees of cultural or religious
 pursuits of a non-political nature can assemble without fear
 of government repression. No effective labor movement has
 existed since the Government, in 1981, suspended trade union
 activities. The Government frowns on organized labor
 activities, although it tacitly approves of an apoliticized
 labor federation that exists mostly on paper. The
 International Labor Organization (ILO) has a case pending
 before it involving the Central African Republic's alleged
 violations of the right to freedom of association under ILO
 Convention 87. The Government has yet to provide the
 substantive information requested by the ILO committee
 reviewing the case. The Government has also been cited in the
 ILO for being in violation of ILO Conventions 29 and 105, for
 allegedly imposing compulsory labor on prisoners jailed for
 unauthorized political activities. In principle, the right to
 strike exists although fear of government reprisals has
 dampened the enthusiasm of potential strikers. However,
 university and school students went on strike for a month in
 January 1984 to protest government decrees establishing
 competitive entrance examinations in both the university and
 the civil service. Several student leaders were briefly
 arrested as were five political opponents whom the Government
 accused of fomenting anti-government sentiment among the
 students.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Religious organizations and missionary groups are protected
 and provided religious freedom by the Constitution, currently
 in suspension. The Government does not generally interfere
 with religious activities. The expulsion of approximately 60
 foreign adherents of the Unification Church in January 1983 is
 the only known exception. No one religion predominates, nor
 does the Government appear to discriminate in favor of or
 against specific religions. About one-fourth of the
 population adheres to animist beliefs.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 People are generally free to move about within the country,
 although there are frequent road checkpoints. The right of
 voluntary travel and repatriation is recognized, and there
 appears to be no sexual discrimination in its application.
 Financial and educational constraints rather than government
 controls restrict most foreign travel and emigration. The
 country remains relatively hospitable to foreigners; the
 largest foreign population living temporarily or permanently
 in the country is from Chad. There are about 5,000 refugees
 in the Bangui capital area. While some make a living on their
 own, the vast majority rely on U.N. relief. In September and
 October, approximately 30,000 refugees--mostly women,
 children, and the aged--arrived in the north from southern
 Chad. Although they have settled temporarily in border towns,
 the Government is working with the United Nations High
 Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) to move them to settlements
 farther away from the border., No case of revocation of
 citizenship was reported in 1984.
 
 
 CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Chanye Their Government
 The Government is headed by Chief of State General Andre
 Dieudonne Kolingoa. He rules with the assistance of 15 fellow
 officers who constitute the Military Committee For National
 Recovery, each of whom also holds a cabinet post. In
 addition, he is advised by eight civilian High Commissioners
 who head their own departments.
 President Kolingba holds in principle all political power,
 appointing, dismissing, and reshuffling members of his
 cabinet. In practice, he allows his cabinet considerable
 leeway in the day-to-day activities of government
 administration although he makes all important policy
 decisions and is the final arbiter of all government matters.
 Since September 1, 1981, all forms of public and private
 assembly for political purposes have been proscribed.
 Kolingba has stated he has *no intention of returning his
 country to the turbulent multiparty experience of the Dacko
 Regime." His September 1984 promise of "progressive
 establishment of democratic institutions" seems unlikely to
 lead to any quick or far-reaching changes in political
 rights.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government does not welcome and is sensitive to
 international or non-govermental investigations of alleged
 human rights abuses but does not prohibit such
 investigations. Representatives of Amnesty International and
 the International Committee of the Red Cross visit Bangui
 periodically to attend public trials and to assess the
 situation in the prisons. In its 1984 report, Amnesty
 International was concerned about the imprisonment of
 prisoners of conscience, long term detention without trial of
 suspected opponents of the Government, procedural shortcomings
 at the trials of political prisoners, and allegations of harsh
 prison conditions. Freedom House terms the Central African
 Republic 'not free."
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 The econotny has suffered in the past 15 years from poor
 policies, inept management, and corruption. The Government's
 ability to stimulate the economy depends on massive and
 long-term contributions of financial and human resources from
 abroad. Current government plans focus on strengthening the
 agricultural sector, primarily through road building/
 maintenance programs and encouraging cash crop production, and
 on upgrading other basic infrastructure. Agricultural
 production during 1984 was good. The cotton harvest surpassed
 official estimates, and the coffee crop also did well despite
 the damages from the 1983 drought. In 1982 per capita gross
 national product was around $308. During 1984 the Government
 continued to implement austere financial measures for its
 civil service and budget for a third straight year. The
 Government made major efforts to reduce the bloated civil
 service. Thus, urban employment conditions became especially
 poor. Current government policy aims to discourage rural
 migration by promoting rural development; 1984 increases in
 the price of cotton may discourage the rural exodus.

 CENTRAL AFRICA. REPUBLIC
 Despite the ravages of tropical diseases and an infant
 mortality rate of 135.7 per 1,000 live births, the country's
 population of about 2.6 million still grows by 2.8 percent per
 year. Life expectancy at birth is only 47 years, because of
 inadequate or simply nonexistent health care in most of the
 country. Although health care is accorded a high priority by
 the Government, it is handicapped by lack of trained
 personnel, and the inaccessibility of large parts of the
 country. In 1976, 40 percent of the urban population and 5
 percent of the rural populaton had access to safe water; in
 all, 16 percent of the country's population had access to safe
 water. In 1977, the average Central African received 95
 percent of the required caloric supply.
 Almost all education in the country is government supported.
 Total school population is about 310,000 (primary through
 university levels). In 1980, about 67 percent of the adult
 population was illiterate (51.7 percent of the men and 80.8
 percent of the women); undoubtedly this rate is far higher in
 the rural areas. The Government is making a concerted effort
 to train more teachers and to build more schools for those
 living outside the capital. In 1979, primary school
 enrollment was 96.72 percent of males and 52.54 percent of
 females of primary school age.
 Women are generally accorded a lower status than men in the
 Central African Republic. Their work at home and in the
 fields prevents many of them from receiving an education.
 Polygamy is common, but the legal system and traditional
 practice support the rights of wives and all children of such
 marriages. A National Women's Organization exists which is
 supported by the Government. There are no women cabinet
 members or high commissioners in the Kolingba Government.
