 UNITED ARAB EMIRATES
 The United Arab Emirates (UAE) is a federation of seven
 small traditional Arab shaikhdoms formed in 1971 when
 Great Britain relinquished its 150-year-old special
 treaty relationship with their rulers. The Emirates are
 unequal in size, population, natural resources, and
 economic development. Abu Dhabi, the largest and
 wealthiest, plays a predominant role in the federation.
 Under Abu Dhabi's ruler, Shaikh Zayid, who also is
 President of the UAE, there has been considerable progress
 toward formation of a centralized and effective federal
 government. Nevertheless, individual emirates continue
 to exercise extensive authority over their own economic
 resources and development planning, police, security
 forces, law courts, and social welfare policies.
 The Emirates' egalitarian Islamic and bedouin traditions
 have shaped their outlook on political organization and
 their attitude toward human rights. The provisional
 federal constitution, adopted initially for five years
 and since extended to December 1981, contains numerous
 guarantees of integrity of the person and civil liberties
 while preserving effective political control in the hands
 of the hereditary ruling families in each emirate. The
 seven rulers (or their deputies) comprise the Supreme
 Council, which is the UAE's highest executive and legis-
 lative body. Its chairman, the UAB Chief of State,
 appoints the Prime Minister, turrently Shaikh Rashid,
 Vice-President of the UAE and Ruler of Dubai) and his
 cabinet.
 The UAE is a country of 200,000 citizens playing host to
 700,000 guest workers and their families. Expatriates
 recruited from other Arab countries, South Asia, Western
 Europe, and the United States make up most of the work
 force, many occupying key managerial, professional and
 technical posts in the public and oil sectors. UAE
 nationals enjoy certain benefits and privileges denied to
 foreign workers, few of whom are offered UAE citizenship.
 This large and diverse foreign population is regarded as
 a potentially serious security (as well as social and
 cultural) problem for the UAE. It is tolerated, however,
 because its skills and labor are essential to the country.
 Aliens deemed security threats or troublemakers are deported
 swiftly. Most foreign workers find high wages and employ-
 ment opportunities which often are unavailable in their
 homelands. Harsh or arbitrary security measures have rarely
 been employed to maintain stability and order in the UAE.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a.   Torture
 Article 26 of the constitution prohibits torture, and no
 instances of torture have been reported.
 
 
 1117
 b.   Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Articles 26 and 28 of the constitution prohibit cruel or
 degrading treatment. Some emirates, notably Abu Dhabi,
 apply traditional Islamic procedures and penalties in
 criminal cases, which are tried in Islamic (Sharia) courts.
 Other emirates have a criminal court system based on
 European models. In Sharia courts certain crimes, such as
 rape and prostitution, have been punished by public flogging
 as well as by fines and, in the case of foreigners, depor-
 tation. Muslims also may be lashed for transgression of
 Islamic laws against drinking alcohol and violating the
 Ramadan fast. Theoretically, the amputation of a hand for
 theft can be imposed by the Sharia courts but, in practice,
 such sentences have been commuted to imprisonment and/or
 deportation. The ruler of the emirate must approve all
 capital sentences.
 Prison conditions are crowded and lack air conditioning.
 Prison diet and medical care are adequate. Prisoners are
 allowed visits from family members, lawyers and, if
 foreigners, consular representatives. There are no reports
 that the authorities condone ill-treatment of prisoners or
 that ill-treatment is common either in detention or after
 transfer to prison.
 c.   Disappearances
 No disappearances have been reported in 1980.
 d.   Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 A recent change in UAE law prohibits arrest without warrant.
 Prolonged detention without trial is rare. One case in-
 volves a member of the ruling family of Sharjah, who, in
 1972, mounted an unsuccessful coup in which the ruler was
 killed. The alleged murderer was never tried and remains
 under house arrest. No other persons currently are known
 to be under arrest or detention for political reasons.
 e.   Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The UAE courts provide fhir and public trials before
 experienced civil or religious judges drawn mainly from
 other Arab countries. There are no jury trials. The
 accused may be represented by counsel of his choice, but no
 public defender system exists. Crimes and punishments are
 defined by law and the accused is presumed innocent. Public
 access to trials involving sensitive security or political
 aspects may be restricted. Special labor courts have been
 established to handle disputes between workers (invariably
 foreigners) and employers.
 f.   Invasion of the Home
 The provisional constitution guarantees freedom from
 arbitrary search, and presentation of a search warrant
 usually is required before police officials can enter a
 home,  In extraordinary circumstances, however, police have
 been known to conduct searches without warrants, especially
 when the government considered that state security was
 involved.

 2. Government    Policies Relating to the Fulfillment
 of Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care
 and Education
 With oil revenues of about $19 billion in 1980, the UAE has
 ample funds for economic and social development. At $16,000
 a year, the UAE has one of the highest per capita incomes in
 the world and an extensive development program. In 1979,
 inflation was about 16 percent and the annual growth rate
 was five percent. The UAE has made a major effort to fulfill
 the basic needs of its citizens for food, shelter, health
 care, and education. The benefits of such programs are dis-
 tributed unevenly among the emirates, with the wealthier
 oil-exporting emirates of Abu Dhabi and Dubai generally able
 to provide more and better social services than the other
 five emirates. Education and, increasingly, health care and
 shelter are provided the less-wealthy emirates through fed-
 eral government projects funded principally by Abu Dhabi.
 The economic system is essentially a form of statism with
 joint government and private ownership of major industrial
 or utility concerns. Private property rights are protected
 under both Sharia and civil law. In accordance with both
 Islamic law and local custom, the right to real property is
 vested in the rulers who, in turn, sell or make liberal
 usufruct gifts of land to UAE citizens. Citizens also are
 usually given preferences in the issuance of business
 licenses or the sale of shares in public enterprises.
 While the status of women in the UAE is limited by tradi-
 tional values, women may own property, including bank
 accounts, in their own right. A small but growing number
 are finding employment with government and private business
 as engineers, policewomen, teachers and social workers.
 Shelter continues to be a problem, especially in rural areas
 of the non-oil producing emirates, where some families still
 live in reed huts. In some emirates, a building boom led to
 a surplus of relatively expensive housing along with a short-
 age of lower-income shelter. Programs to expand the number
 of low-cost housing units are being undertaken by both the
 federal and emirate governments. In some emirates, e.g.,
 Abu Dhabi, water and electricity also are provided residen-
 tial users at subsidized prices. With little arable land and
 sparse water resources, the UAE must import most of its food
 and use desalinated water. Citizens (and in many cases,
 foreigners) are eligible to buy basic commodities at sub-
 sidized prices. A recent UNICEF study shows that serious
 malnutrition affects many UAE nursing infants, owing to a
 lack of education. Health-care programs aimed at improving
 nutritional practices in the home are now a feature of local
 television broadcasts.
 Education is compulsory for citizens from ages six to twelve
 and is free for all academically qualified children from
 kindergarten through university. There has been an expansion
 of teacher training programs, and modern schools now exist
 in all major towns. New schools -- including boarding
 facilities for secondary students -- are being built in
 hitherto remote rural areas. The overall literacy rate is
 about 25 percent but most boys of school age are now in
 school. Women, as well as men, have access to secondary
 and university level education; classes are conducted
 separately. Of the 61,000 students in public primary and
 secondary school, in 1976, an estimated one-third were girls.
 
 
 1119
 Family conservatism and the still-common practice of girls
 marrying soon after puberty have effectively prevented many
 women from continuing their education beyond the primary
 level. The fact that few adult UAE women are literate,
 plus the cultural and family pressures to remain in tradi-
 tional roles within the home, limit women's participation
 in public life. Under the patronage of the UAE's president's
 wife and women from other UAE ruling families, a federation
 of women's organizations has been formed to provide adult
 education, handicraft training, and recreational outlets
 for their members. Labor is in such short supply that any
 UAE wcnan who wishes to work and seeks training can do so.
 Health care, sometimes uneven in quality, is increasingly
 available in government hospitals and clinics,.even in
 remote areas. Treatment is free to all citizens and non-
 citizens; citizens also may be treated abroad at government
 expense.
 Commerce in the UAE is exuberantly free enterprise, although
 subject to laws which ensure that UAE nationals share in
 the country's economic expansion. Given the small popula-
 tion, each of the relatively few qualified individuals must
 hold a variety of positions in both government and
 commerce -- a situation that elsewhere would be seen as
 conflict of interest.
 3. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Includ-
 ing:
 a.   Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and
 Assembly
 UAE citizens are constitutionally guaranteed freedom of
 speech, communication, religio4 and assembly "within the
 limits of the law." Individual citizens feel free to
 express their views on a wide range of public issues without
 fear of official harassment. Radio and television are con-
 trolled by the Ministry of Information and Culture or by
 individual emirate governments, and there are also several
 privately-owned newspapers and periodicals. Mild criticism
 of government actions or policies appear in the printed
 media, even in the official press, but "irresponsible"
 opposition to the government is discouraged. Newspapers
 occasionally are suspended if they deviate too much from
 government policy. Visits by foreign journalists require
 Ministry of Information approval. In late 1980, several
 television journalists were arrested for photographing
 military installations. Books, films, and periodicals are
 subject to censorship of material considered pornographic,
 derogatory of the Arabs or of Islam, favorable to Israel,
 or politically subversive. Because of the UAE's loose
 federal structure, material banned from publication or dis-
 tribution in one emirate sometimes has appeared in another.
 A new press law will soon be promulgated. If issued without
 change, the law would codify in stringent terms the powers
 of censorship, media closures, and control of reporting now
 held informally by the government and already applied (but
 leniently). There are as yet no indications that the law
 would significantly change prevailing government practice
 which tends to influence media editorial decision by quiet
 guidance rather than by forceful edict, and editorial
 criticism indicates a probability that some provisions of
 the law may be moderated before issuance.
 
 
 1120
 Clubs and other organizations must be licensed by the
 federal or emirate governments. By refusing to issue
 permits, individual emirates have been able to prevent
 gatherings they consider prejudicial to public order.
 The provisional constitution establishes Islam as the
 religion of the state. Non-Muslims, virtually all of whom
 are aliens, may practice their faiths so long as this "does
 not conflict with public policy or violate public morals."
 Christian churches and schools are officially tolerated and,
 in fact, occasionally have received financial support from
 the federation. There are restrictions on proselytizing by
 non-Muslims, however, and conversion from Islam to another
 religion is forbidden.
 b.   Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration and Repatriation
 There are no restraints on freedom of movement within the
 country, although visits to certain areas, e.g., oil in-
 stallations, require prior permission from security
 authorities. Foreign travel and emigration for all citizens
 are unrestricted. The right of return is extended to all
 citizens.
 The UAE does not have formalized procedures for handling
 refugees or applicants for asylum. In the past, some
 assistance has been extended to groups of refugees on an
 ad hoc basis and the UAE contributes regularly to the UN
 Relief and Works Agency ($ 940,000 in 1980), and to the
 UN High Commissioner for Refugees ($1 million in 1980).
 c.   Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 There are no political parties or movements in the UAE and
 no provision for their organization in the provisional con-
 stitution. Nevertheless, the federal and local governments
 are founded on bedouin tribal traditions of direct access to
 the ruler, egalitarianism, and consultations in order to
 arrive at decisions. In one emirate -- Abu Dhabi -- this
 consultation has assumed a formal character through creation
 of an appointed consultative council. At the federal level,
 there is a consultative assembly of forty members selected
 by the rulers of the seven emirates. It must be consulted
 on all matters of federal legislation presented by the
 council of ministers to the rulers for approval. Sentiment
 is growing in the UAE that some of these representatives
 should be popularly elected.
 Expatriates are expected to refrain from political activity
 that in any way would affect or involve the UAE. Most of the
 labor force is foreign and labor is not permitted to organize.
 There are no legal provisions for the right to strike or to
 engage in collective bargaining. A few strikes have occured,
 but their leaders, almost invariably aliens, usually have
 been deported. Individual laborers may bring grievances to
 a conciliation committee of the Ministry of Labor and can
 expect fair rulings. Due, however, to language barriers and
 lack of knowledge about conciliation/arbitration procedures,
 many laborers do not utilize this facility.
 In recent months, the government has indicated particular
 concern over the number of foreign workers and the conditions
 of their employment. Aware that many laborers from the Asian
 sub-continent have been attracted to the UAE by promises of
 higher wages, and knowing that many have been misled by
 
 
 1121
 unscrupulous labor agents, the government has tightened up
 considerably on visa procedures. The government also
 recently issued an updated labor law covering conditions of
 employment, compensation, inspection, and enforcement pro-
 cedures. Thus, while some economic abuse of foreign labor
 continues, it is contrary to government policy, which seeks
 to establish a fair and codified system of employment.
 4. Government    Attitude and Record Regarding Inter-
 national and Non-governmental Investigation of
 Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The local press has published articles based on the 1977 and
 1978 reports to the Congress on the UAE's human rights
 practices. The government is sensitive to foreign criticism
 of its handling of guest workers, whom it regards as
 temporary residents having only the limited rights of guests.
 No international human rights groups asked to visit the UAE
 in 1980.
