 DENMARK
 Denmark is a constitutional monarchy with parliamentary democratic rule. Queen
 Margrethe H is Head of State. The Cabinet, accountable to the unicameral Par-
 liament (Folketing), leads the Government. A minority three-party coalition took of-
 fice in September 1994 following national elections, but with the December 1994
 withdrawal of the Center Democrats, only the Social Democrats and Radical Lib-
 erals remained. The judiciary is independent.
 The national police have sole responsibility for internal security. The civilian au-
 thorities maintain effective control of the security forces.
 Denmark has an advanced, market-based industrial economy. One-half of the
 work force is employed in the public sector. The key industries are food processing
 and metal working, A broad range of industrial goods is exported. The economy pro-
 vides residents with a high standard of living.
 The Government generally respects the human rights of its citizens, and the law
 and judiciary provide effective means of dealing with instances of individual abuse.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political or
 other extrajudicial killings.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The law prohibits such practices, and there were no reports that officials employed
 them.
 Prison conditions meet minimum international standards, and the Government
 permits visits by human rights monitors.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The law prohibits arbitrary arrest, deten-
 tion, or exile, and the Government observes this prohibition.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The law provides for an independent judiciary,
 and the Government respects this provision in practice. The judiciary provides citi-
 zens with a fair and efficient judicial process.
 The judicial system consists of a series of local and regional courts, with the Su-
 preme Court at the apex.
 The law provides for the right to a fair trial, and an independent judiciary vigor-
 ously enforces this right.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The law
 prohibits such practices, government authorities generally respect these prohibi-
 tions, and violations are subject to effective legal sanction.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The law provides for freedom of the press, and
 the Government respects this right in practice. An independent press, an effective
 judiciary, and a democratic political system combine to ensure freedom of speech
 and of the press, including academic freedom.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The law provides for these
 rights, and the Government respects them in practice.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for religious freedom, and the
 Government respects this right in practice. There is religious instruction in the
 schools in the official state religion, the Evangelical Lutheran Church, but any stu-
 dent may without sanction be excused from religion classes with parental permis-
 sion.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The law provides for these rights, and the Government respects them
 in practice. The Government cooperates with the United Nations High Commis-
 sioner for Refugees and other humanitarian organizations in assisting refugees. The
 Government provides first asylum (and provided it to approximately 5,896 persons
 in 1996 and 5,101 in 1997). There were no reports of forced expulsion of refugees
 to a country where they feared persecution or of those having a valid claim to refu-
 gee status.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The law provides citizens with the right to change their government peacefully,
 and citizens exercise this right in practice through periodic, free, and fair elections
 held on the basis of universal suffrage.

 The territories of Greenland (whose population is primarily Inuit) and the Faroe
 Islands (whose inhabitants have their own Norse language) have democratically
 elected home rule governments with powers encompassing all matters except foreign
 affairs, monetary affairs, and national security. Greenlanders and Famese are Dan-
 ish citizens, with the same rights as those in the rest of the Kingdom. Each territory
 elects two representatives to the Folketing.
 Women are active in government and politics at both local and national levels.
 In the current Government, 5 of 20 government ministers are women, as are 59 of
 the Parliament's 179 members.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 A number of human rights groups operate without government restriction, inves-
 tigating and publishing their findings on human rights cases. Government officials
 are cooperative and responsive to their views.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Government's operations and extensive public services do not discriminate on
 the basis of any of these factors. The law prohibits discrimination on the basis of
 sex, and it is effectively enforced by the Government. Discrimination on the basis
 of race is covered by two laws, which prohibit racial slander and denial of access
 to public places on the basis of race. The rights of indigenous people are carefully
 protected.
 Women.-An umbrella nongovernmental organization reports that in 1996, wom-
 en's crisis shelters were contacted 12,940 times, and 3,640 women stayed at shel-
 ters. There were 388 rapes reported in 1996, and 332 rapes in the first 9 months
 of 1997.
 The law requires equal pay for equal work, but some wage inequality still exists.
 The law prohibits job discrimination on the basis of sex and providles resources, such
 as access to the Eual Status Council, for those so affected. Women hold positions
 of authority througout society, although they are underrepresented at the top of
 the business world. Women's rights groups are effective in lobbying the Government
 in their areas of concern, such as wage disparities and parental leave.
 Children.-The Government demonstrates a strong commitment to children's
 rights and welfare through well-funded systems of public education and medical
 care. Sections within the Ministries of Social Affairs, Justice, and Education oversee
 implementation of programs for children.
 There is no societal pattern of abuse against children.
 People With Disabilities.-There is no discrimination against disabled persons in
 employment, education, or in the provision of other state services. Building regula-
 tions require special installations for the disabled in public buildings built or ren-
 ovated afr 1977 and in older buildings that come into public use. The Government
 enforces these provisions in practice.
 Indigenous People.-The law protects the rights of the inhabitants of Greenland
 and the Faroe Islands. The Greenlandic legal system seeks to accommodate Inuit
 customs. Accordingly, it provides for the use of lay people as judges, and it sentences
 most prisoners to holding centers (rather than to prisons) where they are encour-
 aged to work, hunt, or fish during the day. Education in Greenland is provided to
 the native population in both the Inuit and Danish languages.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-The inflow of ethnically and racially diverse
 refugees and immigrants has provoked a degree of tension between Danes and im-
 migrants (mostly Iranians, Palestinians, Pakistanis, and Sri Lankans until late
 1992; refugees are now overwhelmingly from Somalia or the former Yugoslavia). Re-
 cent publicity on the involvement of foreigners in street crime and allegations of so-
 cial welfare fraud committed by refugees have increased these tensions to the point
 that Parliament is debating the tightening of immigration laws. Incidents of racial
 discrimination and racially motivated violence do occur but are rare. The Govern-
 ment effectively investigates and deals with cases of racially motivated violence.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The law states that all workers, including military
 personnel and the police, may form or join unions of their choosing. Approximately
 80 percent of wage earners belong to unions that are independent of the Govern-
 ment and political parties. Unions may affiliate freely with international organiza-
 tions, and they do so actively. All unions except those representing civil servants
 or the military have the right to strike.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Workers and employers ac-
 knowledge each others right to organize. Collective bargaining is protectedby law
 
 
 1067
 and is widespread in practice. The law prohibits antiunion discrimination by em-
 ployers against union members and organizers, and there are mechanisms to resolve
 disputes.Employers found guilty of antiunion discrimination are required to rein-
 state workers fired for union activities. In the private sector, salaries, benefits, and
 working conditions are agreed upon in biennial or triennial negotiations between the
 various employers' associations and their union counterparts. If the negotiations
 fail, a national conciliation board mediates, and its proposal is voted on by manage-
 ment and labor. If the proposal is turned down, the Government may force a legis-
 lated solution on the parties (usually based upon the mediators' proposal). The
 agreements, in turn, are used as guidelines throughout the public as well as the pri-
 vate sector.  In the public sector, collective bargaining is conducted between the em-
 ployees' unions and a government group, led by the Finance Ministry.
 Labor relations in Greenland are conducted in the same manner as in Denmark.
 Greenlandic courts are the first recourse in disputes, but Danish mediation services
 or the Danish Labor Court may also be used.
 There is no umbrella labor organization in the Fames, but individual unions en-
 gage in periodic collective bargaining with employers. Disputes are settled by medi-
 ation.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced, or bonded labor by adults
 or children is prohibited, by law and this prohibition is effectively enforced by the
 Government.
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment.-The mini-
 mum age for full-time employment is 15 years. A change in the work environment
 law entered into force in June 1996. This provides for tightening employment rules
 for those under 18 years of age, and setting a minimum of 13 years of age for any
 type of work. The law is enforced by the Danish Working Environment Service
 (DWES), and autonomous arm of the Ministry of Labor. Danish export industries
 do not use child labor. Forced and bonded child labor is prohibited and does not
 occur (see Section 6.c.).
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-There is no legally mandated national mini-
 mum wage, but national labor agreements effectively set a wage floor. The lowest
 wage paid is currently about $11 (dkr 76) per hour, which is sufficient for a decent
 standard of living for a worker and family. The law provides for 5 weeks of paid
 vacation per year. A 37-hour workweek is the norm, established by contract, not by
 law. The law does, however, require at least 11 hours between the end of one work
 period and the start of the next.
 The law also prescribes conditions of work, including safety and health; duties of
 employers, supervisors, and employees; work performance; rest periods and days off;
 and medical examinations. The DWES ensures compliance with labor legislation.
 Workers may remove themselves from hazardous situations or weapons production
 without jeopardizing their employment rights, and there are legal protections for
 workers who fie complaints about unsafe or unhealthy conditions.
 Similar conditions of work are found in Greenland and the Fames, except that the
 workweek is 40 hours. As in Denmark, this is established by contract, not by law.
