 IVORY COAST
 Ivory Coast is a one-party state. Power is concentrated
 in the Democratic Party of Ivory Coast, whose longtime
 leader is President Houphouet-Boigny. The country's first
 competitive elections for party, legislative, and municipal
 posts at local and national levels were held in 1980. More
 open discussions of government policies throughout the
 country have resulted in such institutions as the Ivorian
 National Assembly.
 Ivory Coast remains a developing country in which some
 people experience economic hardship. Nonetheless, steady
 economic growth since independence has, until recently,
 permitted appreciable annual improvement in the standard of
 living throughout the country and contributed to widespread
 support for the policies of the Ivorian Government. During
 the last year, however, Ivory Coast has been squeezed by a
 heavy debt burden and low prices for Ivorian export products
 on the world market. The Government is now introducing
 austerity measures, the political results of which remain to
 be seen.
 The Ivorian Government has emphasized pragmatism and
 moderation in its policies. President Houphouet-Boigny,
 Chief of State since independence and architect of Ivory
 Coast's economic development, sees himself as an apostle of
 "dialogue.' Houphouet has involved dissenters in the
 operation of the Ivorian system rather than isolate or
 imprison them.
 In February 1982, two days of student and faculty
 demonstrations on the university campus in Abidjan evoked
 speedy and firm government action: the entire higher
 educational system was temporarily closed down after police
 arrested hundreds of demonstrators. The Government's efforts
 to reassert its authority, calm things down, and get students
 back into classrooms were successful. The basic issues--the
 drop-out rate, jobs after graduation, funding of programs,
 freedom to form associations--remain, and have yet to be
 adequately addressed.
 There are no political prisoners in Ivory Coast. There has
 never been execution of political opponents, and and there is
 no history of violent action against specific ethnic or
 religious minorities. Barring a radical change in Government
 or in existing governmental policies, there is no evidence
 that this record will not continue.

 1.   Respect for Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Killing
 Amnesty International's 1982 report, reviewing events
 of 1981, notes that the death penalty for political offenses
 in Ivory Coast has been abolished. In February 1981, 46 or
 more Ghanaian residents of Ivory Coast suffocated during a
 police roundup after having been placed in a small,
 poorly-ventilated cell. The Ivorian Government conducted an
 investigation of this incident and arrested the officer
 responsible although the disposition of his case has not been
 made public. No further incidents of this type were reported
 during 1982. There are no reports of any politically-
 motivated killings either by the Government or by opposition
 groups.
 b. Disappearance
 There are no reports of any cases of abduction, secret
 arrest, or clandestine detention. There have been no
 allegations of persons disappearing.
 c. Torture
 The Ivorian penal code prohibits the use of violence by
 official means unless there is legitimate justification.
 The code does not, however, specifically mention or
 prohibit torture, nor does it define what constitutes
 "legitimate justification" or the level of violence
 officials may use. There have been no reports of torture
 during 1982.
 d. Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment
 Paragraph (a) above noted the 1981 incident in which
 46 Ghanaians suffocated in a small, unventilated cell.
 There have been no further incidents of this sort, and
 it appears to have been an isolated case. Systematically
 cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment of individuals or
 prison inmates is not thought to occur routinely, but
 foreign Africans are likely to be treated more roughly by
 police than are Ivorians. Lower level police officials
 sometimes beat prisoners, risking sanction by ignoring
 official orders to the contrary. One recent report
 claims airport officials used a cattle prod during what
 was presumably an interrogation of an African.
 Prisoners are allowed visits from attorneys of their
 choice and family members, who provide food to supplement
 the sparse prison diet. Prison conditions are poor.
 There is no evidence of discriminatory treatment of
 prisoners on the basis of sex, ethnicity, race, or type
 of crime, once they are committed to prison.
 e. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 The Ivorian Constitution and pertinent statutes prohibit
 arbitrary arrest or imprisonment and they rarely occur.
 The Government does occasionally detain individuals it
 believes may be security threats, sometimes for several
 months or more. During 1982, it has also taken firm
 measures against acts it considers threats to internal
 
 
 147
 security, the most public egample being the arrest of
 student demonstrators on the university campus in February
 1982.
 In May 1981, Amnesty International appealed to the Ivorian
 Government to release a group of approximately 20 striking
 television and radio employees who had been drafted into
 the Army following their reported attempts to damage
 equipment at the TV station. The strikers were released
 from the Army in September and returned to their jobs.
 There appear to have been no subsequent instances of Ivorians
 being drafted into the Army as a form of extra-judicial
 punishment. The possibility of being so drafted, however,
 may be considered by some as a strong disincentive to getting
 involved in violent anti-government activities. An
 individual who in 1981 reportedly threw a fire bomb toward
 President Houphouet was held by the the authorities for
 several months without charges.
 Under the Ivorian penal code, a public prosecutor can
 detain a suspect for up to 48 hours without bringing
 charges. Any further detention must be ordered by a
 magistrate. Magistrates can authorize periods of deten-
 tion of up to four months, but must provide to the Minister
 of Justice a monthly written explanation of why detention
 should be continued.
 f. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Ivorian law provides for the right to a fair public trial,
 and appears to be respected in urban centers except in rare
 cases. In rural areas justice is often administered at the
 village level through traditional institutions. The
 judiciary is independent of the executive and military, and
 that independence is respected. Defendants have the right to
 legal counsel, and the Ivorian judicial system provides for
 court-appointed attorneys to be retained for indigent
 defendants. In practice, however, such attorneys are not
 readily available. Appeals of verdicts of civilian courts
 are made to the court of appeals. Civilians are not tried by
 military courts. There is no structure of appeals courts
 within the military justice system. Persons convicted by a
 military tribunal occasionally request the Supreme Court
 to set aside the tribunal's verdict and order a retrial.
 g. Invasion of the Home
 The Code of Penal Procedures specifies the conditions for
 entry into a private residence. A policeman or investi-
 gating magistrate may conduct searches of homes without a
 warrant, if he has reason to believe there is evidence
 concerning a crime on the premises. He must have the
 prosecutor's agreement to retain any objects seized in
 the search. He is required to have witnesses to the search
 which may not take place between the hours of 9:00 p.m. and
 4:00 a.m. Legal safeguards against arbitrary searches are
 generally respected in the modern parts of cities. In
 less-developed urban sectors and in rural areas legal
 safeguards are sometimes ignored. There were no specific
 reports of forced entry or other violations of the home
 during 1982. There were no reports of bugging or similar
 measures.
 
 
 148
 2.   Respect for Civil and Political Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Despite Ivory Coast's established one-party system, there
 is a large measure of freedom of speech. Critics of the
 Government feel free to express themselves in informal
 situations, among Ivorians and foreigners alike, without
 fear of reprisal. Limits have been placed from time to
 time, however, on the expression of controversial views in
 public forums.
 There were student disorders in February 1982 over what
 the students termed a curtailment of free speech--i.e.,
 the Government had cancelled previously-scheduled extra-
 curricular lectures and debates because similar events
 some days earlier had resulted in disorders on campus.
 The students became so exercised over these cancellations
 that they built barricades within the university, re-
 portedly roughed-up the rector, and threw stones at
 passing vehicles. At a critical point in the student
 strike, the university teachers also went on strike,
 ostensibly in sympathy for the students, but actually
 to press demands of their own. The Government thereupon
 closed the university, evicted students from all dormitor-
 ies, cut off professors' salaries and student scholar-
 ships, withdrew government and party recognition of the
 university teachers' union, and declared its strike illegal.
 These measures effectively broke the strikes, and classes
 resumed shortly afterward, with salaries and scholarships
 being immediately restored. Since that time, however,
 only apolitical gatherings are permitted on campus and
 other university property, and one outspoken student
 publication has been banned. On the other hand, students
 still speak freely about politics in informal situations.
 All Ivorian students receive generous scholarships from
 the Government, which cover lodging, food and other
 expenses. The temporary suspension of these scholarships
 in February 1982 appears to have been a disincentive to
 further anti-government activity.
 All Ivorian news media are owned or controlled by the
 sole political party (one daily newspaper, one weekly
 news magazine) or the Ministry of Information (wire service,
 radio, TV). The Government's announced policy is for the
 media to play a positive role in promoting national unity and
 development. It allows criticism of certain kinds. In
 practice this means criticism can be made of the shortcomings
 of policy execution, but not of policies themselves. Foreign
 publications are readily available and are not seized, even
 when they criticize the Ivorian Government, the party, and
 the President. The authorities attempt to suppress distri-
 bution of occasional locally-produced anti-government
 tracts.
 
 
 149
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Freedom of assembly is generallly respected in Ivory Coast.
 When the Government perceives a significant and immediate
 danger to public order, however, it prohibits meetings and
 arrests persons disregarding its orders. Most unions are
 organized and directed by a government-sponsored umbrella
 union, the leaders of which occupy important positions in the
 top organs of the country's single political party. Despite
 the party's significant influence, unions effectively address
 workers' concerns. The right to strike exists in theory, but
 strikes are discouraged in practice. The university
 teachers' strike of February 1982 was particularly irksome to
 the Government, as the teachers seemed to be capitalizing
 on the general disorder in the university to press their
 own demands. Official recognition was withdrawn from the
 union, which thereupon ceased to exist as a legal entity.
 A unegotiating committee" of ex-union leaders has been formed
 to work thfngs out with the Government, but it has so far not
 succeeded in getting the union reinstated. Wildcat strikes
 occur occasionally. If there appeared to be a threat to
 public order the strikers or their leaders might be detained
 temporarily. Generally, the Government negotiates with
 strikers and resolves at least some of their economic
 grievances. There have been no reports that professional
 groups have experienced persecution and/or harrassment.
 The Government, however, attempts to bring them under its
 wing or that of the party, so as to exercise control over
 their activities.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 There are no known impediments to religious expression in
 Ivory Coast, nor does adherence to any particular faith
 have any advantages. The open practice of religion is
 permitted, and there are no restrictions on religious
 ceremonies or teaching.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 The Government exercises minimal control over domestic
 and foreign travel. Checkpoints operate regularly outside
 major urban areas for verification of personal identi-
 fication, motor vehicle licenses, insurance papers, and other
 documents. Ivorians can freely travel abroad and emigrate
 without distinction as to sex. Ivorians have the right of
 voluntary repatriation. Ivory Coast's refugee and asylum
 practices are liberal. The country bas resettled or granted
 safehaven to Angolans, Eritreans, Guineans, Liberians,
 Indo-Chinese, and Ghanaians. The Ivorian Government issues
 refugee travel documents which permit refugees to return to
 Ivory Coast within two years. While in Ivory Coast, they
 receive one-year renewable resident visas for their first
 five years in the country, after which they may apply for
 permanent resident's cards. Ivory Coast does not take any
 significant responsibility for the economic and social
 welfare of refugees.
 
 
 150
 e. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Political participation in Ivory Coast is'limited to the
 single Democratic Party of Ivory Coast. Opposition groups do
 not exist openly and are discouraged. The President is at
 the center of the party apparatus and keeps most political
 power in his own hands. He operates through a nine-person
 executive committee, a 41-person political bureau, and a
 100-person steering committee. The President launched a
 wide-ranging program of democratization in 1980 (within the
 single party framework). There was intense competition in
 national assembly elections, in which all citizens were
 eligible to vote, and about 50 percent of the top local party
 leaders were voted out of office. In November 1980,
 contested municipal and national legislative elections also
 resulted in a significant turnover of elected officials.
 Members of the national legislative body appear to work
 in their constituents' interests more vigorously than
 their predecessors did, and debate within the insti-
 tutions in which they serve has been more open. Public
 written criticism of basic governmental policies,
 or of the President, rarely occurs.
 Some Ivorian traditional societies accord women consider-
 able political and economic power. The October 1980 Party
 Congress devoted a separate section of its final resolution
 to reiterating and strengthening the official policy of
 encouraging full participation by women in social, economic,
 and political life. Women remain, however, very lightly
 represented at the higher levels of the Government and the
 party.
 3.    Government Attitude Regarding International and Non-
 governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations of
 Human Rights
 The Government of Ivory Coast has usually been co-
 operative toward inquiries into its human rights situation.
 The most recent concerned a published report by Amnesty
 International in Paris that the Government had drafted
 striking TV employees into the Army as a form of extra-
 judicial punishment. The Government at first maintained
 that these men were simply doing their duty as conscripts.
 Later, the men appeared in uniform on national television
 and were told they were being returned to civilian life.
 Ivory Coast has a chapter of Amnesty International. In
 their 1982 report, Amnesty International mentioned among
 its concerns detention without trial, the forcible
 repatriation of exiles, and ill-treatment of detainees.
 Freedom House called Ivory Coast "partly free" in 1982.
 4.   Economic, Social, and Cultural Situation
 Ivory Coast's population in 1981 was 8,208,000 with an
 annual growth rate of 3.4 percent. Per capita GNP is
 estimated at $1,149 (1980), with life expectancy at birth
 being 47.1 years. The country's infant mortality rate is
 126.8 per 1,000 live births, and its adult literacy rate was
 20 percent in 1970, although that figure is undoubtedly
 higher today. Forty-four percent of the population has
 access to safe drinking water, and the ratio of calorie
 supply available for consumption relative to nutritional
 
 
 151         .
 requirement was 105 percent in 1977.  Ivory Coast's primary
 school enrollment ratio was 74 percent in 1978.
 Ivory Coast's population of over 8 million includes at
 least two million foreign Africans, perhaps as many as
 70,000 Lebanese and 45,000 French, and small numbers of
 other Europeans, North Americans, and Asians. A great
 disparity exists between the standard of living of foreign
 residents and the Ivorian elites on the one hand, and
 the urban poor and villagers on the other. Nonetheless,
 there is a sizeable, growing urban Ivorian middle class,
 and living conditions in the villages have improved markedly
 and steadily during Ivory Coast's 22 years as an independent
 state. Most villages have wells, and at least three years of
 primary education are offered in all but small villages.
 Efforts are being made to consolidate the smallest villages
 to the minimum size necessary to provide education, health,
 and other public services. The country has constructed an
 excellent nationwide network of paved highways, and nearly
 all Ivorians have access to motorized transportation. In
 rural areas tribal customs dictate the division of tasks,
 and these sometimes fall heavily on women. Female
 circumcision continues to be practiced among elements of the
 Ivorian population. Individuals have property rights, which
 tend to be better protected in urban than rural areas.
 In rural areas land tenure and other property rights are
 dictated mostly by local custom.
 Ivory Coast has a substantial degree of self-sufficiency
 in food production. While perhaps 50 percent of the rice,
 75 percent of.red meat, and 100 percent of the wheat are
 imported, ample supplies of traditional starches, vegetables,
 fish, and other proteins are available and affordable.
 Malnutrition'sometimes occurs, but there is no evidence of
 starvation.
 Better-paying government and private sector Jobs seem to
 be concentrated among the minority Muslim (25 percent)
 and Christian (15 percent) populations, a phenomenon more
 related to urbanization and access to education than to
 a systematic pattern of discrimination. On the other
 hand, the Government's policy of Ivorianization requires
 that all positions be offered to Ivorians before foreig-
 ners may accept them. This essentially keeps foreign
 'Africans from most wage and salary jobs in the modern
 sector. Education absorbs some 40 percent of the operat-
 ing budget and is generally available to all children,
 Ivorian and foreign, boys and girls. Health, on the other
 hand, absorbs only seven to eight percent of the operat-
 ing budget. Health services are more readily available
 in cities than in rural areas. During the current period
 of economic austerity many health centers are operating
 without medicines and other medical supplies.
