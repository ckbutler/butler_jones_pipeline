 ALBANIA
 Albania is a small, isolated Balkan nation which has been
 independent of Turkish rule only since 1912. The present
 Communist regime came to power at the close of World War II
 in the wake of Italian and German occupation and has ruled
 without interruption since then. Marked by xenophobia, a
 harsh brand of Marxism, militant atheism, and a singular and
 abiding respect for Josef Stalin, the leaders of the Communist
 Albanian Workers Party have imposed stern and uncompromising
 control over the Albanian people and rigid resthctions on
 the exercise of political and civil liberties.
 The United States Government does not have any kind of
 relations with Albania and has not had any official repre-
 sentatives in that country since 1946. It is therefore not
 able to report or comment in any authoritative or compre-
 hensive manner on the actual conditions within Albania.
 On paper, the present Albanian Constitution provides for a
 number of rights including freedom of speech, press organi-
 zation, association, assembly, and public manifestation. It
 prohibits discrimination, makes special mention of equal
 rights for women, and proclaims the inviolability of the
 person and the home. Acc6rding to the Constitution, the
 Albanian courts are independent. From the evidence available,
 however, few if any of these constitutional guarantees of
 individual rights are respected by the Government in any
 meaningful way. Freedom of religion is not only not respected,
 but all religious organizations and activity are specifically
 prohibited in the Constitution and by government policy.
 Amnesty International cites religious sources as reporting
 that a number of Roman Catholic,* Orthodox, and Moslem
 religious leaders are serving terms in prison or at forced
 labor.
 Private international organizations concerned with human
 rights issues have received fragmentary reports which indi-
 cate serious and systematic violations of human rights by
 the Albanian Government. Amnesty International reports
 allegations of torture of political prisoners and summary
 trials. There are also reports of discrimination against
 the small ethnic Greek minority in southern Albania.
