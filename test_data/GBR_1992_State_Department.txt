 UNITED KINGDOM OF GREAT BRITAIN AND NORTHERN
 IRELAND*
 The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (UK) is a constitu-
 tional monarchy with a democratic, parliamentary government elected in periodic,
 multiparty elections. As there is no written constitution, human rights are 'resid-
 ual" i e. assumed unless limited by statute.
 Throughout the UK, public order is maintained by civilian police forces responsive
 to and controlled by elected officials. Because of terrorist violence, the Royal Ulster
 Constabulary (RUC) in Northern Ireland is supported by army units.
 The United Kingdom has a highly developed industrial economy. Persons may
 own property and pursue private economic interests. The Government provides com-
 prehensive social welfare services.
 Terrorist bombings and killings carried out by the illegal Provisional Irish Repub-
 lican Army (PIRA) and other 'republican" (Catholic) and "loyalist" (Protestant) ter-
 rorist groups in Northern Ireland and Britain are the greatest threat to public order
 and security in the UK. By the end of 1992, over 3,000 people had died in 23 years
 of "the troubles" in Northern Ireland which has a population of 1.5 million. Dozens
 more have been killed in PIRA attacks on the mainland of Great Britain including
 four in 1992. Emergency measures enacted because of the terrorist problem in the
 past 20 years suspend certain due process guarantees and restrict freedom of move-
 ment, expression, and association. In 1992 there were a few instances of the use of
 excessive force by security forces. Seven persons were killed in 1992 by on-duty se-
 curity forces in Northern Ireland. The Government investigated each case; two sol-
 diers were charged with murder in one instance. Nine members of the security
 forces were killed in Northern Ireland. After British courts held in several cases
 that convictions of alleged terrorists in past years were based on unreliable evidence
 and coerced confessions, the Government in 1991 appointed a Royal Commission to
 review the criminal justice system in England and Wales and announced that con-
 sideration would be given to applying to Northern Ireland any resulting rec-
 ommendations (see Section i.e.). The tensions and long-held grievances between the
 two communities in Northern Ireland have caused some persons, Catholic and
 Protestant to be denied equality of rights and opportunities despite government ef-
 forts to redress these grievances.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Induding Freedom from
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no political killings by
 the Government. However, questions about instances of extrajudicial killing contin-
 ued to be raised. In Northern Ireland, 84 persons were killed in incidents related
 to terrorism, including 34 by republican terrorists, 38 by loyalist terrorists, and
 seven by on-duty security forces. Three were killed by an off-duty policeman who
 later committed suicide, and, in the two remaining cases, the perpetrators or mo-
 tives are unknown. Nine of those killed were members of British security forces.
 Deaths as a result of shootings by security forces in Northern Ireland continued to
 prompt charges that soldiers resort to lethal force precipitately and were carrying
 out a "shoot to kill policy. In one such incident in February, four acknowledge
 PIRA terrorists were killed by security forces shortly after having attacked an RUC
 station in Coalisland. Human rights groups claimed that excessive force was used
 and that the men could have been arrested rather than killed. The police are inves-
 tigating whether the use of force was warranted. In September Peter McBride was
 shot and killed while running away from an army patrol. Two soldiers have been
 charged with murder. In November Pierce Jordan was shot and killed by police after
 a car chase. A police investigation has begun, but no charges have been filed. Fol-
 lowing an RUC investigation, a police officer was charged with murder for the Sep-

 report on the United Kingdom.
 
 
 959
 tember 1991 shooting death of a 19-year-old student. Two Royal Marines were
 charged in February with murder for the December 1990 killing of Fergal Caraher
 in South Armagh. The Government has denied that a "shoot to kill" policy ever ex-
 isted. All killings by security forces-police or army-are investigated by the police.
 The Independent Commission for Police Complaints (ICPC), established by the Gov-
 ernment, monitors these investigations but has little independent investigative ca-
 pability. Although the European Convention on Human Rights establishes a stand-
 ard for use of lethal force only when "absolutely necessary" in specific cir-
 cumstances, British law requires only that the use of lethal force be "reasonable in
 the circumstances." Soldiers involved in shooting incidents have argued that they
 were in "imminent danger" before opening fire. The courts have generally accepted
 this defense, and there have been very few convictions of on-duty soldiers.
 In cases involving killings, the emergency laws stipulate that soldiers and police-
 men must be charged with murder; there are no provisions for lesser charges such
 as manslaughter or unlawful killing. Prosecutors and judges have been reluctant to
 seek and im pose such heavy penalties.
 Security forces in Northern Ireland continued the use of plastic bullet rounds
 (PBR's) for riot control, though their use has declined sharply in recent years; there
 were no fatalities from PBR's in 1992. The PIRA continued to carry out killings in
 Northern Ireland and Great Britain. PIRA bombs have caused extensive property
 damage, and a large bomb in London in April killed three people, including a 15-
 year-old girl. There has also been a substantial rise in the number of persons killed
 by loyalist terror groups in Northern Ireland.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no disappearances attributed to government
 forces. There continued to be instances of persons abducted or held hostage by ter-
 rorists in Northern Ireland.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 British laws forbid torture and other cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment of
 prisoners and provide penalties for violations of those laws. Confessions obtained by
 such methods are not admissible as evidence in court. A new code of practices that
 came into force in 1991 brought about greater standardization of police interrogation
 procedures and strengthened oversight requirements. However, allegations of tor-
 ture and mistreatment of persons detained by the police in holding facilities in
 Northern Ireland continued.
 The Independent Commission for Police Complaints in Northern Ireland has lim-
 ited powers. It reviews all complaints against the police, and automatically super-
 vises police investigations of those involving death or serious injury, as well as any
 others of its choosing. It may insist that disciplinary charges be preferred against
 police officers and may comment on the quality of police investigations but has no
 control over the outcome of disciplinary cases or prosecution decisions by the Direc-
 tor of Public Prosecutions. In its first 2 years of operation, the ICPC failed to sub-
 stantiate any of the 840 claims of ill-treatment in police custody submitted to it. In
 a majority of cases, complainants' refused to cooperate with police or ICPC investiga-
 tions of their claims. Others point out that complainants often prefer to sue in civil
 court, where they may be awarded payment of significant damages as a result of
 court rulings or out-of-court settlements.
 Although the Government acknowledges the widespread perception of abuses dur-
 ing detentions, it has so far refused to accept human rights groups' recommenda-
 tions that interrogations in police custody be videotaped, on the grounds that the
 tapes could compromise ongoing operations and jeopardize the safety of detainees
 who cooperate with the police. Instead, the Government announced in December the
 appointment of a senior barrister as Independent Commissioner for Holding Cen-
 ters. He has the authority to make irregular and unannounced visits to any of the
 three holding centers, observe interrogations on television monitors, and interview
 detainees.
 Security forces in Northern Ireland frequently harass citizens verbally, particu-
 larly young people in areas.where community support for PIRA is considered high.
 Security forces have also been accused of more serious incidents of mistreatment.
 In May, afer a member of the Paratroop Regiment lost his legs in a PIRA bombing,
 a series of confrontations between members of the regiment and residents of the
 town of Coaliland resulted in the beating of several townspople and four soldiers
 and in shooting injuries to three local youths. The regional army commander was
 relieved of his post, and the RUC announced in November that six soldiers would
 face criminal charges.
 Northern Ireland terrorist groups frequently carry out "punishment shootings" of
 persons allegedly engaged in "antisocial activities." These assaults, which typically
 involve shooting through one or both knees at short range, have been widely con-
 
 
 960
 demned. One person died in December from       injuries suffered in a PIRA
 "kneecapping."
 Prison facilities in the UK are generally good, although a Government-appointed
 investigator has found problems of overcrowdin , substandard conditions and lax
 discipline at some prisons in Great Britain. In Northern Ireland, prison facilities
 have improved notably in recent years, but conditions at some holding centers are
 substandard. Uniformed police observe all interrogations on television monitors but,
 as noted above, they do not allow tapes to be made.
 In March, in a prison for female offenders at Maghaberry in Northern Ireland,
 female police conducted a 'full search" of about 21 inmates after receiving informa-
 tion that a weapon had been smuggled into the prison. Some of the women resisted,
 and several were injured. Human rights groups condemned the use of a "strip
 search" and questioned the use of force. The Government maintained that with the
 cooperation of prisoners a "full search" does not involve physical contact and can be
 completed quickly.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-In instances when reasonable cause to
 suspect criminal guilt exists, plice may make arrests without warrants. Those ar-
 rested without warrant must be released on bail within 36 hours unless brought be-
 fore a magistrate's court. The court may authorize an additional 60 hours of deten-
 tion before charges must be brought. Generally, persons charged with what British
 law defines as nonserious" offenses may be released on bail. In cases such as
 crimes of violence, however, magistrates have remanded persons for periods of up
 to 18 months before trial.
 Reacting to the violence in Northern Ireland, the Government adopted the North-
 ern Ireland (Emergency Provisions) Act of 1991 (EPA), which is applicable only to
 Northern Ireland, and the Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary Provisions) Act of
 1989 (PTA), most of which is applicable to the entire United Kingdom. Both acts
 replaced earlier versions dating back to 1973 and 1974 respectively. Both must be
 renewed annually by Parliament.
 Under the EP, police and military personnel, in dealing with cases of suspected
 terrorism, may enter and search without warrants, and members of the armed
 forces on duty may arrest without a warrant, any person suspected of having com-
 mitted or being about to commit any offense. Such persons may be held for up to
 4 hours after which they must be transferred to police custody or released. The
 1991 EPA introduced new offenses-of directing a terrorist organization and pos-
 sessing items intended for terrorist purposes-and gave authorities new powers to
 examine financial and other documents found in terrorist-related searches. The PTA
 allows the police to arrest without warrant persons anywhere in the UK whom they
 reasonably suspect to be involved in terrorism. The authorities may detain such per-
 sons for up to 48 hours without legal representation or 4udicial review. Suspects
 may be interrogated during this time, and confessions obtained may be used in sub-
 sequent court proceedings. Judicial review may be delayed up to a further 5 days
 on the authority of the Home Secretary or, in Northern Ireland, the Secretary of
 State for Northern Ireland. In 1988 the European Court of Human Rights ruled that
 detention of terrorist suspects beyond 4 days without judicial review violated the
 European Convention for the Protection of Human RiGhts and Fundamental Free-
 doms. The Government, arguing that no satisfactory judicial mechanism could be
 found, filed a derogation from the Convention.
 The Government does not practice exile (see, however Section 2.d. on freedom of
 movement within the country). In Northern Ireland, PIRA has forced a substantial
 number of Catholics to leave the province, by threatening them with death or injury
 if they remain. Such threats are made generally on the grounds that these Catholics
 have cooperated with security forces or engaged in "antisocial behavior."
 e. Denial of Fair Public TriaL-Fair trial is provided for by law and generally ob-
 served in practice, but there have been serious exceptions in the past. An indigent
 defendant has the right to counsel of his choosing. All criminal proceedings must
 be conducted in public, with the exception of juvenile court cases and cases involving
 ublic decency or security. In a trial under the Official Secrets Act, the court may
 closed at the judge's discretion, but the sentence must be passed in public.
 The UK has a multitier court system. The vast majority of criminal cases are
 heard by magistrate's courts, which are managed by locally based committees. Their
 decisions may be appealed to the Crown Court, which also hears criminal cases re-
 quiring a jury trial, or to the High Court. From the Crown Courts, convictions may
 e appealed to the Court of Appeal, which in turn may refer cases involving points
 of law to the House of Lords. The Appellate Committee of the House of Lords (which
 consists of senior judges and is functionally distinct from the legislative arm of the
 House) is the final court of appeal in the UK. Once all these appeals have been ex-
 hausted, defendants in England and Wales may appeal to the Home Secretary to
 
 
 961
 refer a case back to the courts if fresh evidence has emerged which casts doubt on
 the conviction. (Appeals may be made to the Northern Ireland Office and the Scot-
 land Office in those areas.)
 Since 1989, following referrals from the Home Secretary, courts in England have
 overturned the convictions of 18 persons previously imprisoned in connection with
 PIRA terrorist attacks in the 1970's. The moat recent such decision, in June, in-
 volved Judith Ward, convicted in 1974 of involvement in three bombings, in one of
 which 12 persons died. In the Ward case (repeating similar findings in the Bir-
 mingham Six, Maguire Seven, and Guildford Four cases), the Appeal Court con-
 cluded that Ward's confession was unreliable, that forensic evidence against her was
 tainted, and that exculpatory evidence had been withheld from the defense. The
 Court's ruling in the Ward case established a precedent that all evidence held by
 the prosecution, whether or not intended for use in court, may be released to the
 defense at the judge's discretion.
 Twenty additional convictions have been quashed in nonterrorist cases since 1989,
 most of them on grounds similar to those in the Ward case. According to critics in
 the UK and abroad, the pattern that emerged brings into question whether trials
 under the British judicial system always meet international standards of fairness.
 In at least the cases in question, lower courts relied too heavily on uncorroborated
 confessions and assumed that the integrity of the police was irreproachable. Appeal
 court judges tended to accept lower court rulings and occasionally displayed open
 hostility to defendants and their lawyers.
 In Northern Ireland in-July, the Court of Appeal overturned the convictions of
 three former soldiers for the murder of a Catholic in 1983. The conviction of a fourth
 soldier was upheld. The RUC is investigating apparent irregularities in police ques-
 tioning of the soldiers.
 Such apparent miscarriages of justice prompted the Government in March 1991
 to appoint a Royal Commission to review all aspects of the criminal justice process
 in England and Wales. The Commission has collected submissions from numerous
 professional bodies, nongovernmental organizations, and individuals, and has com-
 missioned surveys of lawyers, defendants, and the general public on how the admin-
 istration of justice is perceived. The Commission is scheduled to publish its findings
 in June 1993. Although the Commission is not studying Northern Ireland, the Gov-
 ernment indicated it would consider whether changes implemented as a result of the
 Commission's findings might also be applied in Northern Ireland.
 In 1973 the Government suspended the right to trial by jury for certain terrorist-
 related offenses in Northern Ireland because of intimidation of the judiciary, jurors,
 and lawyers. In such cases, a "Diplock Court," in which a single judge presides over
 a trial without jury, is used. The judge in a Diplock Court must justify his or her
 decision to convict in a document that becomes part of the court record, and appeal
 courts may overturn Diplock Court convictions on substantive as well as legal
 grounds. These courts have been widely criticized by human rights groups, although
 the conviction rate for defendants pleading not guilty is virtually identical to the
 rate in regular courts.
 Under a 1988 change of law, a court in Northern Ireland may draw whatever in-
 ference it deems proper, including an inference of guilt, if a subject remains silent
 during questioning, though he cannot be convicted solely on the basis of such an
 inference. The change was intended to deal with a PIRA tactic of advising members
 not to say anything under interrogation, then to present a surprise alibi at trial,
 but it substantially erodes the presumption of innocence. Courts in Northern Ireland
 have drawn inferences from silence in approximately 10 cases in 1992, though in
 each case there was additional evidence to support conviction.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 right to privacy is generally respected in both law and custom. Warrants are nor-
 mally required for a police search of private premises. However, under the EPA, on-
 duty members of the armed forces or policemen may enter any premises or other
 place if they consider it necessary to preserve peace or maintain order. The Act re-
 quires a standard of "reasonable grounds of suspicion" before a dwelling may be en-
 tered without a warrant.
 In the Catholic communities in Northern Ireland, where distrust of the Govern-
 ment has deep historical roots, many believe that the conduct of some members of
 the security forces in carrying out security checks constitutes unwarranted harass-
 ment and intimidation. The Government conducts intensive training of security per-
 sonnel in proper procedures but acknowledges that official guidelines are sometimes
 violated.
 
 
 962
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Libertes, Including
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-Strongly held tradition, an independent press,
 and a democratic political system combine to secure freedom of speech and press.
 Viewpoints critical of the Government are well represented. British print media are
 dominated by a handful of national daily newspapers, all privately owned and high-
 ly independent (though often generally aligned with one of the major political par-
 ties). About half the electronic media is run by the British Broadcasting Service
 (BBC), which is funded by the Government but enjoys complete editorial independ-
 ence. The remainder are run by corporations under renewable government license.
 The Government continued to prohibit British radio and television from broad-
 casting the voices of members of Proscribed terrorist organizations such as PIRA
 and of representatives of Sinn Fern (the legal political arm of the PIRA), as well
 as the voices of those who 'solicit, support, or invite support for such organizations."
 Critics charge that the vagueness of this last category intimidates broadcasters into
 applying the ban even in ambiguous cases. There are no restrictions on reporting
 such persons' words, and exceptions are made for coverage of elections and par-
 liamentary proceedings.
 In 1991 an independent television station broadcast a documentary that alleged
 that police forces in Northern Ireland worked in collusion with loyalist death
 squads. Officials protested the documentary, and in July the High Court fined those
 responsible for the program for refusing to divulge the identity of a key anonymous
 informant. In September police arrested the researcher who worked on the program
 on pe ury charges, which were later dropped.
 b.Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-Except in cases of extreme
 civil disorder in which public safety is judged to be at risk, the authorities do not
 exercise their statutory right to limit the freedom of public assembly. The PTA and
 EPA include sections prohibiting membership i    or supot of, organizations in-
 volved in terrorism. These organizations are specifically listed in the statutes. The
 lists do not include political parties. In August the loyalist Ulster Defense Associa-
 tion (UDA), nominally the political wing of the banned Ulster Freedom Fighters,
 was added to the proscribed list.
 c. Freedom of Reli8ion.--Gvernent policy and genera practice ensure freedom
 of religion. There are two established churches in Britain-tose legally recognized
 as official churches of the State: in England the (Anglican) Church of England, and
 in Scotland the (Presbyterian) Church of Scotland. In Northern Ireland, the Con-
 stitution Act of 1973 prohibits discrimination by public authorities on the basis of
 religious belief or political opinion (see Section 5 concerning the Fair Employment
 Act). There is no similar law in Great Britain. There are no religious bars to holding
 public office, although ministers of the Churh of England and the Church of Scot-
 land are not eligible to be Members of Parliament.
 The Government provides funds for many schools maintained by various religious
 denominations, including Anglicans, Catholics, Methodists, and Jews. In May 1992,
 the High Court ruled that a local council's decision to deny funding to a Muslim-
 run school was 'manifestly unfairP and that the Education Secretary should recon-
 sider. In Northern Ireland, the Government provides full funding for nonsectarian
 (but overwhelmingly Protestant) state schools. For denominational (mostly Catholic)
 schools , the Government provides 100 percent of operating costs and 85 percent of
 capital costs. In December, the Government announced that denominational schools
 could qualify for full state funding if no single (sectarian) group comprised a major-
 ity of the school's board of governors.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-UK citizens enjoy freedom of movement within the country and in for-
 eign travel, emigration, and repatriation. The Home Secretary, however, may ex-
 clude from mainland Britain anyone connected with terrorism in Northern Ireland,
 unless that person was born in Great Britain or has been resident on the mainland
 for 3 years. Similar authority is granted to the Secretary of State for Northern Ire-
 land to exclude persons not native to or resident in that province. In ordering exclu-
 sion, the Secretary of State need only be "satisfied" that a person is or has been
 involved in the commission, preparation, or instigation of acts of terrorism. Cur-
 rently 91 persons are subject to such exclusion orders. No additional exclusion or-
 ders were issued in 1992. Human rights groups have objected to such orders be-
 cause the evidence used is not tested in any court.
 Immigration rules require that all requests for asylum be considered by the Home
 Office in accordance with the 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees.
 The Government makes generous provision for political refugees, but faced with an
 exponential rise in asylum applications in recent years, it has introduced legislation
 to speed processing of unsubstantiated requests. Human rights groups claim the leg-
 
 
 963
 islation would undermine Britain's commitment to provide haven for legitimate ref.
 ugees.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The Government is formed on the basis of a majority of seats in the House of
 Commons, won in elections held at intervals not longer than 5 years. Participation
 in the political process is open to all persons and parties. In the 1992 general elec-
 tion, 2,903 candidates representing 93 parties were officially registered. All citizens
 18 years of age and older may vote. Northern Ireland has city and district councils,
 as in the rest of the UK, but with somewhat fewer powers. England and Wales also
 have county councils, which Northern Ireland does not. (Scotland's structure is dif-
 ferent still.) From 1922 to 1972, Northern Ireland had a devolved provincial Par-
 liament at Stormont, which was suspended because its domination by the unionist
 majority was seen as contributing to the troubles. Several attempts have been made
 since then to restore devolved government. A third major effort is now under way.
 Most British dependent territories have small populations, under 60,000, and are
 ruled by appointed governors or administrators assisted by exendtive councils (usu-
 ally appointed) and legislative assemblies or councils (partly elected).
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 A large number of local nongvernmental human rights organizations operate
 freely with no government intererence or restriction. In 1973 a Standing Adior
 Commission on Human Rights was established by the Government to monitor
 human rights in Northern Ireland.
 A number of international nongovernmental human rights organizations, includ-
 ing Amnesty International, are based in the UK. The Government cooperates fully
 with international inquiries into alleged violations of human rights and usually
 takes steps to rectify its own laws and policies when they are found not to be in
 conformity with human rights agreements to which it is a party.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Language, or Social Status
 British law bars discrimination on the basis of race, color, nationality, or national
 or ethnic origin and outlaws incitement to racial hatred. Although racia discrimina-
 tion is not specifically outlawed in Northern Ireland, its incidence is much lower
 than that of religious discrimination. The Secretary of State for Northern Ireland
 has agreed to investigate the scope for possible legislation on racial discimination
 and determine what additional action should be taken bygovernment departments
 to further enhance equal treatment of ethnic grups. A government-appointed, inde-
 pendent Commission for Racial Equality (CR,) supports persons taking court action
 under the Race Relations Act of 1976, providesB guidelines on good p~ractice, and may
 initiate court action. After formally investigating complaints, the CRE may issue no-
 tices requiring that discrimination cease. Sucl notices are followed up over a 5-year
 period to ensure compliance.
 Persons of African and south Asian origin face substantial unofficial discrimina-
 tion. Several studies have shown that they are less likely to obtain jobs and mort-
 gages than are whites. Members of Asian and African minorities are occasionally
 victims of "skinhead" violence. The Government is strongly opposed to such discrimi-
 nation and violence, and prosecutes cases in which evidence is available.
 Equal opportunity for both sexes is protected by law. An Equal Opportunities
 Commission (EOC) supports persons who bring discrimination cases beore ind us-
 trial tribunals and courts and produces guidepines on good practice for employers.
 The number of sex discrimination complaints rose 40 percent in 1991. Large compa-
 nies have begun to revise job classifications and pay structures in an effort to
 achieve parity. In one 1992 case, a court ruled that a woman teacher was due, retro-
 actively, equal pay with her male colleagues, setting a potentially important prece-
 dent, In a landmark sex discrimination suit before the industrial tribunal, a senior
 female police officer who repeatedly had been denied promotion reached a settle-
 ment with police authorities in July, under which she received compensation, and
 the EOC, was invited by the Home Office to participate in an in-depth review of
 promotion and selection procedures for high-level police positions. Women have
 equal property rights and equal rights in the divorce courts.
 Offenders in domestic violence cases are prosecuted and may be imprisoned. Wom-
 en's shelters provide refuge for battered wives, and local governments provide coun-
 seling services. Rape victims receive similar support. In a 1991 court case brought
 on appeal, the House of lards ruled for the first time that nonconsensual sex within
 marriage could constitute a criminal offense.
 
 
 964
 Discrimination on religious grounds continued to occur in Northern Ireland, in-
 cluding at times by local governments. Discrimination in employment on the
 grounds of religious belief or political opinion has been unlawful since 1976. Within
 the Northern Ireland civil service, the proportion of Catholics under age 36 reflects
 overall demographic patterns, but they continue to be underrepresented in the
 upper age groups and grades. Government efforts to increase recruitment of Catho-
 lics into the police force and related security fields have been hampered by PIRA
 assassinations and death threats. For a variety of historical and social reasons, the
 Protestant community controls much of the local economy, and anti-Catholic dis-
 crimination persists in the private sector. Despite an overall increase in employment
 in Northern Ireland, the Catholic male unemployment rate remained 22 times that
 of Protestant men.
 The Fair Employment (Northern Ireland) Act of 1989 is intended to end employ-
 ment discrimination and is aimed at outlawing even unintentional or "indirect" dis-
 crimination. All public sector employers and private firms with more than 25 work-
 ers must register with the Fair Employment Commission, monitor the religious com-
 position of their work force, supply annual monitoring reports to the Commission,
 and review their overall employment practices at least once every 3 years. These
 obligations were extended to small firms (employing between 11 and 25 workers) be-
 ginning in 1992. While the Fair Employment Act has been criticized for not estab-
 lishing sufficiently rigorous targets and timetables, in general it has been praised
 by leaders of the Catholic community. Employers who fail to comply face criminal
 penalties and loss of government contracts. A Fair Employment Tribunal has been
 established to adjudicate individual cases of alleged discrimination. In 1992 for ex-
 ample, tribunals found five local councils, including that of Belfast, guilty of dis-
 crimination against Catholic job applicants, and directed payment of compensation.
 Although most companies are in compliance with the legislation, fines for violations
 have been imposed on some firms.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Workers have the right to form and join representa-
 tive organizations, associate freely, choose representatives, publish journals, openly
 promote members' interests and views, and elect representative assemblies to deter-
 mine union policies and procedures. Unions participate freely in international orga-
 nizations.
 Unions are free of government control but, like employers' associations, must reg-
 ister their accounts with a government-appointed 'certification officer." Senior union
 officers must be elected by secret ballot. The law mandates secret ballots before a
 strike call, prohibits unions from disciplining members who reject a legal strike call,
 and allows individual trade union members to lodge complaints against their union
 with a government-appointed "Commissioner for the Rights of Trade Union Mem-
 bers."
 There is no specific statutory "right to strike" in the UK. Voluntary cessation of
 work may be considered a breach of contract. A system of legal immunities which
 protected unions from prosecution when engaged in lawful industrial action has
 been narrowed by a series of acts of Parliament introduced in the 1980's. These acts
 have excluded secondary strikes and actions judged to have political motives.
 Unions encouraging such strikes are subject to fines by the courts and may have
 their assets seized. The legislation also restricts the ability of unions to act against
 subsidiaries of prime employers with whom they are in dispute when the subsidi-
 aries are not party to the dispute and are the employers of record. This has led to
 union complaints that they have no protection against the transfer of work within
 the corporate structure (making unions the victims of a form of employer secondary
 action). The 1990 Employment Act made unions liable for all industrial actions, in-
 cluding unofficial strikes, unless the unions concerned write to strikers repudiating
 their action. Unofficial strikers may be legally dismissed. In instances where the
 right to strike is prohibited (e.g., for police officers), there are alternative means to
 resolve differences.
 The International Labor Organization (ILO) in 1989 and again in 1991 upheld
 complaints against government bans on the disciplining by unions of members who
 reject lawful strike calls and on union indemnification of members and officers for
 sanctions imposed for engaging in approved union activities. Following a case in-
 volving the dismissal of 2,000 striking seamen, the ILO called for changes in legisla-
 tion to protect workers taking industrial action. The Government has contested the
 concluions of the ILO and in 1990 adopted legislation that the Trades Union Con-
 gress (TUC) alleges violates ILO conventions by narrowing the range of situations
 in which lawful industrial action may be taken.
 
 
 965
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The ri$ht to organize and
 bargain collectively is deeply rooted. There is no legal obligation for employers to
 bargain with workers' representatives, nor have collective bargaining agreements
 historically been legally binding or enforceable in the courts, but collective bargain-
 ing is extensive, involving over 10.2 million workers, or about 40 percent of the work
 force. It is illegal to deny a worker employment on the grunds that he or she is
 or is not a union member, except in the case of the armed forces, the police, or the
 security services.
 The 1984 ban on membership in national unions by employees of the sensitive
 Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) lid to complaints being lodged
 at the LO by the TUC. The ILO and COE has affirmed that the ban and the dis-
 missal of workers retaining union membership are in violation of ILO Convention
 87. The 1991 and 1992 International Labor Conference expressed "deep concern" at
 the continuation of the ban. The British Government maintains that its actions in
 the GCHQ case fall within Conyention 87's exemption for the armed forces and are
 also consistent with ILO Convention 151 on labor relations in the public service. In
 November the CFA found that in another case covering the civil service, the Govern-
 ment's unilateral termination of a long-standing civil service arbitration agreement
 was a violation of the agreement, although not in itself a violation of Convention
 151, and called on the Government and the unions to "bargain in good faith" and
 develop a new framework to settle disputes.
 Workers who believe themselves victims of antiunion discrimination may seek re-
 dress through industrial tribunals. Remedies include payment of indemnities and
 reinstatement by employers found guilty of discriminatory practices, although rein-
 statement rarely occurs. A backlog of tribunal cases has developed in recent years.
 The ILO has also questioned whether British legislation adequately protects against
 denial of employment on the grounds of past or present trade union activity. Evi-
 dence of blacklisting was collected by a House of Commons Select Committee. In
 September 1991, press reports detailed one organization's compilation and distribu-
 tion of a list of 22,000 activists to prospective em loyers.
 Following a breakdown and abolition by the overnment of a longstanding bilat-
 eral collective bargaiin negotiating process, teachers' pay and conditions have
 been unilaterally determined since 1987by the Secretary of State for Employment.
 The ILO concluded that these procedures are not compatible with ILO Convention
 98 on the right to organize andbargain collectively. In 1991 legislation was adopted
 that provided that teachers' pay and conditions should be defermined by an inde-
 pendent review body, which was appointed in September.
 Export processing zones do not exist.
 c. Prohiition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced or compulsory labor is pro-
 hibited in the UK and its dependent territories and possessions and is not practiced.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-School attendance until the age
 of 16 is compulsory. Children under the age of 16 are not permitted to work in an
 industrial enterprise except as part of an educational course.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-There is no legislated minimum wage. In 26
 low-wage industries employing approximately 2 million workers, wage councils of
 employers and trade union members establish minimum hourly wages and overtime
 rates for adult workers. Provisions are legally enforced by a team of inspectors. Min--
 imum wage rates vary from one industry to another, but all are substantially below
 the national average earnings figure. The UK does not have a law limiting daily
 or weekly working hours. in November the Government introduced a bill that
 would, if enacted, abolish the wage councils.
 The Health and Safety at Work Act of 1974 requires that the health and safety
 of employees not be placed at risk. A health and safety commission enforces regula-
 tions on these matters and may initiate criminal proceedings. The system of occupa-
 tional health and safety is efficiently managed and operates with the full involve-
 ment of workers' representatives.
