 ETHIOPIA
 The People's Democratic Republic of Ethiopia is a single-party
 state headed by President Mengistu Haile-Mariam, who led a
 military takeover in 1977. The Leninist-style Constitution
 adopted in 1987 provided for a Council of State, a Council of
 Ministers, and a Parliament (Shengo). In 1990 President
 Mengistu rhetorically abandoned Marxism-Leninism, but the
 Workers' Party of Ethiopia (WPE) remains the most powerful of
 the country's political institutions. Power remains in the
 hands of President Mengistu, who is Chief of State, General
 Secretary of the WPE, and Commander-in-Chief of the armed
 forces.
 Ethiopia's armed forces are the largest in sub-Saharan Africa,
 numbering well over 300,000 troops and assisted by Soviet and
 North Korean advisers. An extensive security apparatus under
 the Ministry of Internal Affairs attempts to control the
 population through a combination of surveillance and
 informers. The Government justifies its security and defense
 expenditures (at least 60 percent of the government budget) on
 the basis of a civil war involving various insurgencies,
 principally involving Eritreans, Oromos, and Tigrayans. The
 insurgents' success in 1990, including taking the port city of
 Mits'iwa early in the year, led the Government to intensify
 its coerced mobilization of thousands of new recruits, many of
 them under 16 years of age.
 The Ethiopian economy is based on small-farm agriculture,
 which employs 85 percent of the population. Coffee exports
 provide 65 to 75 percent of foreign exchange earnings. In
 March the Government announced potentially far-reaching
 economic reforms, declaring in favor of free market policies,
 including deregulation of inefficient state-sponsored
 agriculture and privatization of money-losing state
 enterprises. There has been very little progress toward
 official implementation of these reforms, due substantially to
 the Government's preoccupation with war mobilization.
 However, changes have occurred in rural areas despite
 Government inaction, as peasants have met little resistance in
 dismantling producer cooperatives. Chronic drought conditions
 in much of the country also continue to drain precious
 resources from a nation that is among the poorest in the world.
 Human rights in Ethiopia in 1990 continued to be affected
 seriously by the long civil war, which again took an
 extraordinary cost in lives and property. All sides engaged
 in harsh conscription campaigns. The Government held
 negotiations with the Eritrean People's Liberation Front
 (EPLF), the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF), and the
 Eritrean Liberation Front (ELF), but at year's end there was
 little progress toward a cease-fire, although there was
 cooperation with relief organizations in moving food shipments
 into famine areas. The Government and the EPLF agreed in
 December to the World Food Program proposal to reopen the port
 of Mits'iwa to relief shipments.
 Major human rights abuses by the Government included: the use
 of torture in interrogation; arbitrary, incommunicado
 detentions; the lack of fair public trials; restrictions on
 freedoms of speech, press, assembly, and association, and the
 right of citizens to change their government; and limitations
 on worker rights. On the positive side, Ethiopia officially
 allowed increased rates of emigration for Ethiopian Jews,
 especially after Ethiopia and Israel agreed in November to
 implement new modalities for family reunification.

 ETHIOPIA
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 Ethiopia's 29-year-old civil war continued to cause great
 numbers of casualties, including among civilians (see Section
 1.g.).
 In May, 12 generals convicted of mounting a coup against
 President Mengistu in 1989 were executed after a 5-month trial
 that did not meet accepted standards of fair trial.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reports of political disappearances by the
 Government this year. Amnesty International noted in its 1990
 report.(covering 1989) that detainees arrested after the May
 1989 coup attempt were held incommunicado and that unconfirmed
 reports indicated at least one detainee "disappeared" while in
 custody. There are frequent disappearances of party and
 government officials in areas that fall under the control of
 the TPLF insurgents.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 The 1987 Constitution notably omits a passage from the 1955
 constitution prohibiting cruel and inhuman punishment. The
 Ministry of Internal Affairs maintains numerous interrogation
 and detention centers, such as the Central Prison and the
 notorious "Third Police Station" in Addis Ababa and the Mariam
 Gimki Center in Asmera. Physical abuse and torture are common
 for those detainees suspected of affiliation with an
 opposition or insurgent group, or harboring antigovernment
 sentiments, although since the advent of negotiations there
 has been a sharp drop in the number of reports of torture.
 These groups have included members of the EPLF, TPLF, Oromo
 Liberation Front (OLF), ELF, and the Ethiopian People's
 Revolutionary Party (EPRP). Common methods of torture have
 included beating on the soles of the feet, suspension from a
 rope in a contorted position, death threats, mock executions,
 sleep deprivation, and submergence to the point of
 unconsciousness in tanks of water.
 The 12 generals sentenced to death for alleged involvement in
 the 1989 coup attempt were reportedly tortured before their
 executions (see Section i.e.).
 In May the authorities arrested an estimated 350 students for
 demonstrating in Addis Ababa against the execution of the 12
 generals. They were taken to a police training camp outside
 the capital, detained for 1 week, made to walk barefoot over
 sharp stones, and given minimal food rations.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The 1987 Constitution provides for arraignment in court within
 48 hours, arrest warrants, a fair trial, protection against
 self-incrimination, and the right to counsel. However,
 Ethiopians suspected of antigovernment actions or sentiments
 continue to be subject to arrest or detention by the police
 without charge or judicial review. In politically sensitive
 
 
 117
 ETHIOPIA
 arrests, the Government generally prefers to operate
 furtively, taking the suspect from home at night.
 Door-to-door searches at night have also been a common feature
 of the Government's forced conscription campaigns.
 The 1988 state of emergency declared for Eritrea and Tigray
 remains in effect and permits security forces to stop, detain,
 and hold indefinitely at any time, without court or
 prosecutor's warrant, any person who has violated or is
 suspected of having violated the special emergency decree or
 who in any manner disturbs law and order within the emergency
 areas. In these war-torn areas, both sides in the conflict
 often detain persons on the slightest suspicion.
 The Government freed 620 persons, described as "legal and
 political prisoners", from Eritrean prisons in September.
 Reportedly the "political" prisoners covered by the release
 were predominantly those arrested while resisting
 conscription. Government forces in Eritrea have been
 encircled by the EPLF since February, and lack of food was
 believed to be the major factor in the Government's decision
 to release the large number of prisoners.
 While precise information is difficult to obtain due to
 government secrecy, reports suggest that up to 500 political
 detainees may remain in Ethiopia. The Government's use of the
 term "political prisoner" extends to those resisting
 conscription and to those arrested for possible connection to
 rebel movements. Many detainees are students or former
 government officials arrested during the Red Terror of the
 late 1970's. Most have never been charged and are Oromos,
 Eritreans, and Tigrayans. The Government arrested four
 Ethiopian Jews in 1987 who were sentenced to 5-year terms and
 are being held in Gonder. Three others were jailed in Gonder
 this fall for alleged involvement with the TPLF. The
 Government does not use exile as a means of political control.
 e. Denial of Fair Public'Trial
 Ethiopia's judicial system remains bifurcated in practice if
 not in theory. While nonpolitical civil and criminal
 offenders are usually granted fair public trial, military and
 political cases are subject to official manipulation and
 executive meddling. The definition of what constitutes a
 "political" case is broadly interpreted by the Government but
 usually relates to the Government's preoccupation with
 internal security or alleged political opposition. Prisoners
 cleared of charges or whose terms have been completed may not
 be promptly released from prison.
 While the Supreme Court is at the apex of the judicial system,
 other judicial bodies include a Supreme Court Council, a
 Worker's Control Committee, and military courts in contested
 areas. Since the 1974 revolution, the kebeles (urban
 neighborhood organizations controlled by the WPE) have been
 the primary local units of judicial decisionmaking and law
 enforcement. In recent years, their role has been reduced
 somewhat (except for conscription drives), but the kebeles
 still inspire fear owing to their past influence and their
 official status in the government/party structure.
 In 1990, in two separate 5-month trials before the
 specially-constituted military tribunals, the Government tried
 14 generals and 22 lower-ranking officers implicated in the
 1989 coup attempt. In the early trial stages, the accused
 
 
 ETHIOPIA
 were permitted legal counsel, and the proceedings were open to
 the press and family members of the accused. However, the
 court proceedings were held in secret once the evidentiary
 stage was reached, and some reports indicate that a third
 trial for other coup suspects may have been held entirely in
 secret. President Mengistu reportedly intervened to insist on
 death sentences for 12 of the 14 generals. The executions
 were carried out secretly, and the 12 were allegedly tortured
 before their executions.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The 1987 Constitution provides for the "inviolability of the
 house" and protects against unlawful entry into private
 homes. In reality, warrants are not used for searches of
 offices or private homes. In Eritrea, Tigray, and other
 war-torn areas, the state of emergency affords the armed
 forces great latitude in searching or even confiscating
 suspected premises. In their own areas of control, rebels
 also use such tactics.
 Surveillance of persons, both visual and electronic, is not
 subject to legal restraints. All mail is subject to
 government monitoring. Ethiopian citizens can be called in at
 any time for questioning by authorities and for mandatory
 kebele meetings, political rallies, or marches. Refusal to
 appear for kebele meetings, however, no longer results in
 serious sanctions.
 Local kebele association officials monitor the activities of
 urban Ethiopians; peasant association leaders perform the same
 function in the countryside (see Section 6.a.). The scope of
 such surveillance and petty interference in the private lives
 of Ethiopian citizens depends heavily on the makeup of the
 individual kebele and its leadership. In 1990 the kebeles had
 a central role in fulfilling quotas for the military
 conscription campaigns.
 g. Use of Excessive Force and Violations of Humanitarian
 Law in Internal Conflicts
 Civil war continues as the primary factor affecting human
 rights in Ethiopia. Both the Government and the various
 insurgent movements, notably the EPLF and TPLF, have practiced
 forced conscription, imprisonment without recourse, violence
 against civilian populations, torture, and extrajudicial
 killing. Women have fallen victim to rape and abuse by
 government and rebel soldiers, as both sides loot and
 pillage. Human rights monitors accused both the Government
 and the EPLF of using civilians as human shields to protect
 troops and military installations. These abuses of
 humanitarian law have taken place under a declared state of
 emergency and civil war in the northern half of Ethiopia.
 Sporadic, less intense, violence also affects areas in eastern
 and western Ethiopia. There are no reliable estimates of the
 number of civilian casualties in the nearly 30-year-old
 conflict.
 At the end of the year, rebel groups controlled most of
 Eritrea, Gonder, Tigray, and Welo regions, that is, most of
 the north. The main insurgent groups, the EPLF, TPLF, and, to
 some extent the OLF, are fighting groups that, like the
 Government, violate humanitarian laws with varying degrees of
 impunity, severity, and cruelty. EPLF hit teams assassinated
 
 
 119
 ETHIOPIA
 WPE officials in Eritrea. The TPLF executed a local
 administrator in Karakore (north Shewa) in public in April.
 There are credible reports of atrocities by OLF insurgents
 against civilians of ethnic Amhara origin--in Asosa in
 January, and in east Harerge in March.
 In Eritrea, EPLF shells killed over 100 civilians in attacks
 on the Eritrean capital of Asmeri7, while a number of civilians
 were killed in government attacks on Mits'iwa. The EPLF
 accused government warplanes of having singled out densely
 populated neighborhoods in attacks on the towns of Afabet and
 Mits'iwa in April.
 In 1990 the Government, fearing a military collapse, stepped
 up its mobilization campaign, recruiting over 100,000 new
 troops from urban and rural areas during the year. Despite
 guidance that the new recruits be aged 18 years or older, some
 14- to 16-year-olds were caught in the indiscriminate sweeps.
 The government call-up also extended to veterans, retired
 police and security officers, and reservists, some in their
 50's and 60's. In the roundups, some fatalities were
 reported. In at least two instances in eastern Ethiopia, a
 number of Somali refugees were included in the roundups. The
 Government sent the refugees to the front in spite of the fact
 that some of the refugees had documents issued by the United
 Nations High Commissioner of Refugees (UNHCR) that attested to
 their status. Rebel groups also engaged in forced
 conscription.
 In one of the more egregious acts by rebel forces, the OLF,
 with assistance from the EPLF and perhaps the Sudanese Army,
 attacked the refugee camp at Asosa in January. This camp near
 the Sudanese border was home to nearly 43,G00 Sudanese
 refugees who were forced to abandon the camp. In May many
 began arriving in alarming physical condition at the Itang
 camp in southwestern Ethiopia. In October OLF troops ambushed
 a German aid worker and his family, seriously injuring him.
 The OLF also attacked and burned two UNHCR trucks transporting
 food to the Fugnido refugee camp.
 Little information is available on the numbers and treatment
 of prisoners of war (POW's). The Government usually holds
 insurgents in jails or detention centers. The EPLF has been
 holding three Soviet POW's since early 1988 and has refused to
 negotiate their release. The OLF held six Cuban medical
 workers prisoner for several months. The TPLF usually
 releases ordinary soldiers upon capture, after disarming them
 and confiscating their footwear. The International Committee
 of the Red Cross (ICRC) remains barred from access to
 prisoners by both government and rebel sides. The Government
 has, however, allowed ICRC medical teams to assist with
 medical treatment of war wounded in Asmera, Dese (Welo), and
 Bahir Dar (Gojam), areas that have seen heavy fighting in the
 last year.
 Throughout the year, both the Government and the insurgents
 engaged in protracted negotiations with international and
 local humanitarian groups that delayed badly needed food
 relief shipments to civilians. The Government has engaged in
 military attacks on relief shipments, and an unknown quantity
 of relief supplies was destroyed in the EPLF's February attack
 on Mits'iwa. There have been reports of malnutrition-related
 deaths among children in EPLF-besieged Asmera, but extensive
 relief efforts have prevented a repeat of the great famine of
 1984-85.
 
 
 ETHIOPIA
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 There is no freedom of speech or press in Ethiopia. The
 Government closely monitors the pronouncements of public
 officials, academicians, and clergy. Academic freedom,.
 although seriously circumscribed, may have gained some new
 life in 1990 as courses in Marxism-Leninism were no longer
 required after the reforms announced in March.
 The Government owns and operates all information media and
 maintains censorship boards under the Ministry of
 Information. Expression of unauthorized political opinions or
 of views at variance with the official government line has
 resulted in imprisonment. Self-censorship is a fact of life.
 Only governmental political, economic, and social policies are
 disseminated in the official media. In 1990, in the wake of
 military defeats, government media stressed the struggle for a
 united Ethiopia. Coverage of the civil war itself remains
 tightly controlled and is centered around continuous calls to
 arms and sacrifice in defense of the motherland.
 In October Ethiopian television aired the first part of a
 two-part interview by-a well-known professor and outspoken
 government critic, who found fault with the Government's
 handling of the war. The last part of the interview was
 canceled.
 Several citizens expressed an interest in starting new,
 independent publications since the announcement of the March
 economic reforms. The Government did not, however, respond to
 their applications for permission to publish.
 Foreign magazines and newspapers are not readily available
 since foreign exchange is not granted to purchase them.
 Occasionally, publications are confiscated. Foreign radio
 transmissions and broadcasts of the opposition groups are
 widely listened to by Ethiopians. Western embassy news
 releases, statements, books, magazines, and other media
 material are generally allowed to circulate without censorship.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Notwithstanding constitutional provisions, assembly of any
 sort not previously approved by the Government is severely
 restricted. In contrast, attendance at government-sponsored
 rallies, meetings, and parades is frequently mandatory.
 Frequent or close association with foreigners no longer
 results in government harassment or detention. Professional
 associations, such as the Rotary and Lions Clubs, are allowed
 to operate, although their membership and activities may be
 monitored by the Government. Trade and professional
 associations were reorganized in 1986 by the WPE and new
 boards selected from members approved by the party.
 In May, 3 days of student demonstrations followed the
 Government's execution of 12 generals implicated in the coup
 attempt. The students confined their action to the area
 around Addis Ababa University and adjacent secondary schools.
 They burned President Mengistu's effigy, shouted slogans
 demanding a change of government, and carried signs denouncing
 the Government's "shameful" behavior. The protest ended when
 students were rounded up and held in a police training camp
 for about a week. Unlike demonstrations in May 1989, no one
 
 
 121
 ETHIOPIA
 was killed, but there were reports of a few serious injuries
 (see Section l.c.).
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Ethiopian nationalism and traditional values, including
 religion, are an integral part of the national culture.
 Government policy no longer ignores or tries to suppress
 religion. The Government nationalized most property
 controlled by the Ethiopian Orthodox Church (EOC)--thought to
 include as much as 30 percent of all land holdings in Ethiopia
 at the time--when it took power in 1974, and the EOC
 reportedly is dependent on annual government compensation
 payments to cover clerical salaries. The Government actively
 participates in selection of EOC officials to ensure church
 conformity with its policies. The Government extensively used
 the EOC in 1990 as a conduit for its national mobilization
 message to the lowest levels of society.
 The Government has been increasingly willing to permit worship
 and proselytism by Muslims and Ethiopian Orthodox Christians.
 Protestant churches, including Ethiopia's Mekane Yesus Church
 and foreign evangelical organizations, pursue their missions
 in a generally tolerant environment and are increasingly
 praised for their social and humanitarian works. However, the
 Jehovah's Witnesses remained banned. An official ban on
 worship by government officials is not enforced. Officials
 still occasionally schedule mandatory kebele meetings on
 Sunday mornings but do little else actively to discourage
 church attendance.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Freedom of movement within Ethiopia was hindered mostly by the
 expansion of control by rebel groups to most of Eritrea,
 Gonder, Tigray, and Welo. While there have been recent
 Western visitors to Gonder, areas in the northern half of
 Ethiopia remain inaccessible to foreigners. Foreigners -
 wishing to travel within Ethiopia must still obtain travel
 permits, and access to areas of conflict remains restricted.
 Despite occasional delays, the permit process has become
 largely a formality for foreign diplomats.
 Emigration remains highly restricted, though marriage to, or
 adoption by, foreign nationals is allowed. Illegal emigration
 remains punishable by imprisonment or, in exceptional cases,
 by death. However, with the resurgent war, increasing numbers
 of Ethiopians from all levels of society emigrate illegally,
 either under the subterfuge of travel abroad for business or
 to visit relatives or by overland treks and surreptitious
 crossing-of borders.
 The Government issued a record number of passports in 1990,
 continuing a trend begun in 1989. A daughter and two
 grandchildren of former Emperor Haile Selassie received
 passports and were allowed to travel abroad. They had been
 released from prison in 1988. The process can be arbitrary,
 however, with few if any issuances to males between 14 and 45
 years of age during periods of conscription. Even during
 these clampdowns, passports were reportedly available for
 bribes of up to $3,500. The processing of legitimate passport
 applications nevertheless remains a long and laborious
 process. Exit visas must be used within 15 days of issue and
 renewal can be difficult.
 
 
 122
 ETHIOPIA
 Restrictions on emigration have made the plight of Ethiopia's
 22,000-strong Jewish population an urgent human rights
 concern. The community, known as Beta Israel but often
 referred to by other Ethiopians as "Falashas" (a word meaning
 immigrant or outsider), has traditionally been concentrated in
 rural areas ef Gonder and Tigray. During the past year,
 however, most have abandoned their former habitat and traveled
 to Addis Ababa to await permission to emigrate to Israel.
 The Government has stated publicly its commitment to free
 emigration for family reunification among Ethiopia's Jewish
 population. Departures in the spring briefly reached 500
 people a month before the Government erected procedural
 impediments that reduced the figure by more than two-thirds.
 However, an agreement between Israel and Ethiopia reached in
 November increased emigration to earlier levels.
 Around 22,000 Falashas are registered with the Israeli Embassy
 in Addis Ababa awaiting emigration. In the meantime, the
 Jews, having given up their homes in the countryside (which
 were immediately taken over by their non-Jewish neighbors),
 face exorbitant prices for scarce housing and rising prices
 for food in Addis Ababa. As a result of reestablished
 relations between Israel and Ethiopia, their situation has
 been ameliorated to a great extent through assistance from the
 Israeli Government and from Israeli and American Jewish
 philanthropic groups. Ethiopian authorities have not
 prevented these organizations from establishing health and
 education facilities for the Jewish population. The United
 States Government continues to press the Government of
 Ethiopia to put into practice its stated commitment to the
 principle of free emigration.
 The Government recognizes the right of voluntary repatriation,
 and its proclamation of amnesty for Ethiopians living abroad
 (numbering more than 1 million) remains in effect. UNHCR
 repatriation pr.ograms have successfully repatriated
 approximately 16,000 Ethiopians from Djibouti, Somalia, and
 Sudan since 1986. During 1990, the Government cooperated,
 with UNHCR and ICRC, in the repatriation of approximately
 4,000 refugees from Borama, Somalia. There were no reports of
 any forcible repatriation of refugees by the Government.
 Instability in neighboring countries has stimulated a
 large-scale refugee movement into remote areas of Ethiopia,
 with approximately 750,000 people fleeing from both Somalia
 and Sudan. The Government's Administration for Refugee
 Affairs (ARA), under the Ministry of Internal Affairs, has
 been cooperative with the UNHCR and other international
 agencies, and it generally adheres to international norms for
 refugees. Refugee protection, though, is problematic. Areas
 between Ethiopia, Sudan, and Somalia which house refugees
 remain sites of recruiting efforts by the various liberation
 fronts operating within and across the borders. The
 Government has not allowed 24-hour access to refugee camps by
 international relief workers, arguing that their security
 cannot be guaranteed.
 While no official announcements were made, the Government's
 controversial .internal resettlement and villagization
 campaigns have ceased with the announced plans to return
 agriculture to a free market basis and to allow peasants to
 till the land they now occupy. Rural authorities have not
 prevented peasants from returning to their traditional
 homesteads. Most of those forced to resettle came from areas
 
 
 123
 ETHIOPIA
 of Welo and Tigray and could probably return to their home
 lands but for the war.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change their Government
 Citizens of Ethiopia are not free to change the government.
 .The Constitution institutionalizes all power in the.WPE, the
 President, his-advisers, and the 33-member Council of State.
 Political and economic policies are still dictated to the
 populace with little opportunity for public debate. The WPE
 and its mass organizations purport to offer Ethiopian citizens
 a means of participation in government. Official pressure on
 higher level government officials to join the WPE has eased in
 recent years, however, and many members of the bureaucracy
 have declined party membership without an adverse effect on
 their careers.
 President Mengistu's March speech dealt mainly with economic
 reform, but it made passing reference to the creation of a
 new, inclusive, voluntary, and democratic party, the Ethiopian
 Democratic Unity Party. However, by year's end the Government
 had taken no steps to implement political reform.
 The Constitution mandates the formation of local parliaments
 (shengos) in the 25 administrative regions and the 5
 autonomous regions. However, the massive mobilization of 1990
 brought-a new division of the country into seven "zones,"
 presided over by high-ranking military officials or Mengistu
 civilian supporters. These new zonal commanders have been
 given wide latitude over all activities, military and civil,
 in their respective areas of control. They report directly to
 President Mengistu in Addis Ababa. Local elections and
 elaborate plans for the autonomous regions of Aseb, Dire Dawa,
 Eritrea, the Ogaden, and Tigray, intended to solidify WPE
 authority and politicize the populace, have fallen victim to
 the war.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 There is no governmental or private body to investigate
 alleged human rights violations, and it is unlikely the
 Government would permit an independent group to form. The
 Government resists attempts by international and
 nongovernmental organizations to investigate human rights
 cases.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 The Constitution provides for the equality of all Ethiopians
 irrespective of nationality, sex, religion, occupation, social
 or other status. High government offices are no longer the
 exclusive province of the Amhara ethnic group and include many
 Oromos and a few Eritreans and Tigrayans. Almost all senior
 government and political figures are of Christian origin,
 although the population is approximately 50 percent Muslim.
 The Government's appeal to Ethiopian nationalism in its
 struggle against the EPLF and TPLF has resulted in cases of
 harassment and pressure tactics against those of ethnic
 Eritrean and Tigrayan origin. This is not, however, believed
 to be part of a systematic campaign by the Government.
 
 
 ETHIOPIA
 The rights of women are protected and promised additional
 government support by the Constitution. However, various U.N.
 studies indicate traditional practices persist, including
 marriages at very young ages, hard and time-consuming labor,
 inadequate employment opportunities, and subaverage wages in
 urban areas.
 Village leadership, both traditionally and in the rural party
 apparatus, is invariably male, and all clergy are male.
 However, women in major Ethiopian groups (Oromo, Amhara,
 Eritrean, and Tigrayan) enjoy certain economic and legal
 rights equal to those of men. They may inherit, sell, or buy
 property, and many engage actively in business. However,
 women remain poorly represented at the top echelons of
 government. I
 The Revolutionary Women's Association (REWA), a mass
 organization created in 1980, has the proclaimed goal of
 improving the status of women. Problems with money,
 membership, and political priorities have forced REWA to take
 a back seat to coordinated ministerial and international
 organization efforts in bettering the lot of women in
 Ethiopia. The media give ample coverage to conferences and
 other events which concern women.
 Neither the Government nor REWA has specifically addressed the
 issue of domestic violence, but Ethiopian women have redress
 to police protection if subjected to beatings by husbands.
 However, such abuse remains common, with tremendous cultural
 impediments to police interference or the official prosecution
 of instances of domestic violence. Compliant attitudes add to
 sexual discrimination as many Ethiopian women may choose to
 remain cowed by abuse, rather than face the loss of economic
 and social security that marriage affords in Ethiopia. Among
 urban, mostly elite Ethiopian women, divorce and desertion are
 increasing. In some rural areas, women have a subservient
 status within the home, and-child marriages are especially
 common, despite government efforts to curb such practices.
 The Government, in conjunction with international
 organizations, has actively pursued educational efforts,
 warning women of the dangers of female circumcision (including
 infibulation), nutritional taboos, and traditional birth
 methods. The Ministry of Public Health has established a
 National Committee on Traditional Practices, composed of
 representatives of various government ministries, religious
 groups, and international agencies, to help educate and train
 health and social workers to combat these practices.
 Initially reluctant religious groups, including the Ethiopian
 Orthodox Church and the Muslim supreme council, now actively
 discuss--and discourage--female circumcision. These efforts
 often coincide with AIDS education targeted at both urban and
 rural groups.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 There is no independent labor movement in Ethiopia. The labor
 force (outside agriculture) is organized into a single trade
 union federation under the control of the WPE. The right to
 strike is not recognized, and strikes are rare.
 The Ethiopian Trade Union (ETU), founded in 1975 to replace
 the Confederation of Ethiopian Labor Unions (CELU), is the
 
 
 ETHIOPIA
 sole federation to which all trade unions must belong. Union
 jurisdiction is based on work sectors, and there are nine
 industrial unions in the ETU. Only one union is permitted per
 work site. The approximately 370 local unions in the ETU
 comprise 318,000 members (1988). Structured along traditional
 Soviet lines and with many leaders trained in Eastern Europe,
 the ETU's range of permissible activities has now shrunk to
 the point where it is little more than a "transmission belt,"
 carrying to workers the message of the government and party
 leadership. The right to affiliate internationally is
 recognized exclusively for the ETU. The ETU is a member of
 Africa's continent-wide official trade union body, the
 Organization of African Trade Union Unity, and is affiliated
 with the Communist-controlled World Federation of Trade Unions.
 Agricultural workers are organized under the Ethiopian
 Peasants' Association (EPA), which officially has between 4
 and 7 million members. The EPA is an umbrella organization of
 some 20,000 small peasants' associations. In addition to
 being an implement of Government control, the EPA has promoted
 literacy and advances agricultural techniques. in some areas
 the local peasants' associations have had tax collection and
 militia responsibilities. Local peasants' associations bore
 the brunt of rural discontent during 1990. In areas of
 Harerge, some peasant leaders were forcibly removed, even
 killed, by farmers seeking a return of property confiscated
 during the land reform of the late 1970's. Approximately 400
 producer cooperatives in the Bale and Arsi regions have shut
 down over the last 2 years as a result of farmer discontent.
 There has been no official reaction to these events from the
 Government.
 Despite the guarantee of freedom of association in the 1987
 Constitution, workers and farmers are not permitted to
 organize outside of the ETU and the EPA. The EPA is not a
 trade union and is not covered under the 1975 labor code,
 which was drafted with the assistance of Cuban experts.
 The Committee of Experts of the International Labor
 Organization (ILO) has criticized Ethiopia's 1975 Labor
 Proclamation as being contrary to ILO Convention 87 on freedom
 of association and Convention 98 on the right to organize and
 bargain collectively, both of which Ethiopia has ratified. A
 new labor code, written in 1987 after extensive consultations
 with the ILO, would permit collective bargaining and allow
 national unions to form their own federations-independent of
 the WPE. However, the new code has not been passed due to
 reported resistance at high levels of the Government.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 Ethiopia signed 894 collective bargaining conventions between
 1984 and 1986. However, collective bargaining does not in
 fact exist in Ethiopia's public sector. Ethiopia allows
 private enterprise, though government control over supply
 allocations and its strict licensing procedures ensure state
 enterprises a virtual monopoly in areas such as coffee.
 Private sector wages are independent of the Government's
 official tiered wage system. The Ministry of Labor and Social
 Affairs has official responsibility for ratifying any
 collective bargaining agreements and for adjudicating wage
 disputes in the private sector. While there is no antiunion
 discrimination policy, ETU's monopoly on worker membership has
 been criticized by the ILO.

 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Ethiopia has ratified neither of the ILO's Conventions on
 forced labor. Slavery was officially abolished in Ethiopia in
 1942, but other than this the legal code does not address the
 issue of forced or compulsory labor. The Constitution
 mentions both the right to work and the duty to work.
 Citizens are sometimes called on to perform certain civic
 obligations, including "volunteer" assistance in community
 work projects such as road-building and emergency repair. In
 factories, workers are also expected to volunteer extra hours
 at no pay., so production quotas can be met.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 The contract employment of persons under the age of 14 is
 prohibited. This restriction appears to be respected in
 factories, shops, and among domestic workers. The Ministry of
 Labor and Social Affairs is fairly effective in enforcing
 child labor restrictions. However, underaged children are
 frequently seen selling or begging on city streets or working
 in the fields in rural areas.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 Current working conditions vary according to occupation and
 region, but hours are generally long, conditions poor, and
 wages low. The statutory minimum wage, which has not changed
 in 16 years, is 93 cents per day (at the official rate of
 exchange) and is not sufficient to provide a decent standard
 of living for an urban worker and family. On the other hand,
 only unskilled day laborers usually command such a low wage.
 In addition, fringe benefits not required by law
 (transportation, meals, shelter) raise the effective minimum
 wage. Low-paid workers often supplement their income by
 holding multiple jobs, with help from the extended family, and
 with subsistence farming.
 Government wages have been frozen for 15 years. Internal
 government surveys reveal that perhaps two out of every five
 salaried government workers earn less than what is required to
 purchase a typical Ethiopian "grocery basket". The law
 establishes 8-hour workdays and 48-hour workweeks. The
 maximum legal workweek is generally respected in practice, but
 as noted there is much uncompensated "volunteer" labor to meet
 'factory or office quotas.
 The current Labor Code's miscellaneous provisions section
 gives the Minister of Labor and Social Affairs powers "to
 determine protective devices" and to "establish an advisory
 committee" with regard to the health and safety of workers.
 Compensation for occupational injuries and disabilities is
 mandatory. The Ministry's effectiveness in enforcing health
 and safety standards is hampered by a lack of resources.
