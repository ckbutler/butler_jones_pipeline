 AUSTRIA
 Austria is a constitutional democracy with a federal parliamentary form of gov-
 ernment and an independent judiciary in which citizens choose their representatives
 in periodic, free, and fair multiparty elections.
 The police are subordinated to the executive and judicial authorities. The national
 police maintain internal security. The army is responsible for external security.
 Austria's highly developed, market-based economy, with its mix of technologically
 advanced industry, modern agriculture, and tourism affords its citizens a high
 standard of living.
 The Government fully respected the human rights of its citizens, and the law and
 judiciary provide effective means of dealing with instances of individual abuse.
 Tere were occasional reports of abuse by police. The Government is taking serious
 steps to address violence against women.

 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Rlling.-There were no reports of political or
 other extrajudicial killings.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Although the Constitution prohibits such practices, government statistics for 1994
 showed 676 complaints against police officials for "unwarranted use of force" or "ex-
 cessive use of force," an increase of 203 over 1993. Of the 19 officers who faced dis-
 ciplinary or legal proceedings as a result, 2 were convicted, 1 pled guilty, 8 cases
 were suspended, and 8 are pending. Forty-three persons who had filed complaints
 were sued for slander or resisting the police. The Interior Minister who entered of-
 fice in April stated that he had ordered prompt and unbiased investigations of police
 brutality complaints. Although he noted that Austria had sufficient instruments to
 protect citizens against illegitimate use of police force, he added that he was striving
 to strengthen police training on human rights.
 Prison conditions meet minimum international standards. The Government is a
 party to the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fun-
 damental Freedoms, which includes a provision for human rights monitoring mis-
 sions. In individual cases, investigating judges or prison directors have jurisdiction
 over questions of access.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.--The Constitution prohibits arbitrary ar-
 rest, detention, or exile, and the Government observes this prohibition.
 In criminal cases the law provides for investigative or pretrial detention for up
 to 48 hours, except that in cases of charges of "aggressive behavior" an investigative
 judge may within that period decide to grant a prosecution request for detention up
 to 2 years pending completion of an investigation. The grounds required for such
 investigative detention are specified in the law, as are conditions for bail. The inves-
 tigative judge is required to evaluate an investigative detention at 2 weeks, 1
 month, and every 2 months after the arrest.
 e. Denial ofFair Public Trial.-The Constitution provides for an independent judi-
 ciary, and the Government respects this provision in practice. The judiciary provides
 citizens with a fair and efficient judicial process. There were no reports of political
 prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution prohibits such practices, government authorities generally respect
 these prohibitions, and violations are subject to effective legal sanction.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of the
 press, and the Government generally respects this right in practice, although strin-
 gent slander laws tend to discourage reports of police brutality. Publications may
 e removed from circulation if they violate legal provisions concerning morality or
 public security, but such cases are extremely rare.
 Television and national radio are government monopolies, but they present di-
 verse points of view. A law passed in 1993 permits regional private radio stations,
 but implementation of the law was delayed due to legal challenges by unsuccessful
 applicants for licenses. After the Constitutional Court ordered the revision of radio
 frequencies and after complaints against the law were dropped in Styria and Salz-
 burg, two stations opened. The new text of the law, with rewritten radio frequency
 rules, is expected to be passed in 1996.
 Academic freedom is respected.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 freedom of assembly and association, except for Nazi organizations and activities (an
 exception stipulated also in the Austrian State Treaty of 1955). The law on the for-
 mation of associations states that permission to form an organization may be denied
 if it is apparent that the organization will pursue the illegal activities of a prohib-
 ited organization.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-While the Constitution incorporates the Treaty of St.
 Germain, which restricts this freedom to religions deemed compatible with public
 safety and morality, no religions have been banned or hampered, and practitioners
 of all faiths worship free of governmental interference. To qualify as a recognized
 religious organization, a religious group must have enough members in the country
 to indicate the probability of a long-term presence (approximately 2,000 members
 according to practice) and must register with the Government. Thirteen organiza-
 tions have qualified.
 
 
 770
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Government does not restrict movement, including emigration.
 Citizens who leave the country have the right to return at any time.
 Provisions for granting asyum are generally in accordance with the standards of
 the 1951 U.N. Convention on Refugees and its 1967 Protocol relating to the status
 of refugees. The Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees and other inter-
 national refugee organizations criticize Austria's asylum policy as too restrictive,
 and likely to result m refugee applicants being sent back to third countries that are
 not safe. In August the Interior Minister instituted a new ruling that rape as an
 instrument of political, ethnic, or religious repression constitutes grounds for asy-
 lum. The increasing occurrence of rape cases in the war zones in the former Yugo-
 slavia prompted the ruling.
 The Immigration Law was amended in April to facilitate procedures for residence
 applications and to remove several flaws that had caused hardship.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The Constitution provides citizens with the right peacefully to change their gov-
 ernment. Citizens exercise this right in practice through periodic, free, and fair elec-
 tions held on the basis of universal suffrage.
 Prior to the 1995 election, approximately 23 percent of the members of Parliament
 and 6 of 20 cabinet members were women.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 A number of human rights groups operate without government restriction, inves-
 tigating and publishing their findings on human rights cases. In some cases, they
 have been dissatisfied with the information authorities have supplied in response
 to specific complaints.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The law provides for comprehensive protection against any of these kinds of dis-
 crimination in employment, provision of welfare benefits, and other matters, and the
 Government generally enforces its provisions effectively.
 Women.-Official data for 1994 (latest available) show 12,986 reported cases of vi-
 olence against women, of which 546 were rapes and 266 other sexual assaults. Po-
 lice and judges enforce laws against violence; however, only about 10 percent of
 abused'women file complaints. 'Te Government plans to expand police authority to
 enforce-measures banning an abusive spouse from a previously jointly owned home
 or other places where the victim might be stalked.
 Most legal restrictions on women's rights have been abolished. Women are still
 prohibited7 by law from night work in most occupations. Although this ban is some-
 times used as a pretext for not hiring women, it is supported by the Women's Affairs
 Ministry and women's organizations. (Nurses, taxi drivers, and a few other occupa-
 tions are exempted from this ban.) According to a 1994 ruling by the European
 Court of Justice, a sex-based prohibition of nighttime work is not permissible. The
 Government has been granted a transition period until 2001 to adapt its legislation
 to gender-neutral European Union regulations, and is due to report in 1997 on its
 progress.
 In addition to the federal Women's Affairs Ministry, a federal Equality Commis-
 sion and a federal Commissioner for Equal Treatment oversee laws prescribing
 equal treatment of men and women. Sixty percent of women between ages 15 and
 60 are in the labor force. Despite substantial gains in women's incomes, they aver-
 age 20 percent lower than those of men. Women are not allowed in the military.
 Although labor laws providing for equal treatment extend to women in the civil
 service, they remain underrepresented there. To remedy this, a 1993 law requires
 hiring women of equivalent qualifications ahead of men in civil service areas in
 which less than 40 percent of the employees are women; but there are no penalties
 for failure to attain the 40-percent target.
 Women may be awarded compensation of up to 4 months' salary if discriminated
 against in promotions because of their sex. The Labor Court can also award com-
 pensation from employers to victims of sexual harassment.
 Women's rights organizations are partly politically affiliated, and partly autono-
 mous groups. In voicing their concerns, they receive wide public attention.
 Children.-Laws protect the vast majority of children's rights established in inter-
 national conventions and in some respects go beyond them. Each provincial govern-
 ment and the federa Ministry for Youth and Family Affairs has an "Ombudsperson
 for Children and Adolescents" whose main function is to resolve complaints about
 
 
 violations of rights of children. There is no pattern of societal abuse against chil-
 dren.
 People With Disabilities.-Disabled individuals are protected by law from discrimi-
 nation in housing, education, and employment. The law requires all private enter-
 prises and state and federal government offices to employ 1 disabled person for
 every 25 to 45 employees, depending on the type of work. Employers who do not
 meet this requirement must pay a fee to the Government, and the proceeds help
 finance services for the disabled such as training programs, wage subsidies, and
 workplace adaptations. No federal law mandates access for the physically disabled;
 some public buildings are virtually inaccessible for those unable to climb stairs.
 National/RaciallEthnic Minorities.-The Interior Ministry issued a report on
 rightwing extremism, which showed that in 1994 the number of complaints and re-
 ports of incidents of rightwing extremism, xenophobia, and anti-Semitism rose to
 601, which wai 14 percent higher than 1993. Sixty-one cases resulted in court sen-
 tences. The rise in the number of cases spcifically related to the law against neo-
 Nazi activities was steeper. 38 percent higher in 1994 than in 1993.
 Members of several ethnic and racial groups were the targets of bombs that
 caused injury or death. For example, on February 4, four members of the Roma com-
 munity were killed in Oberwart when they tried to take down an anti-Roma sign,
 triggering a bomb. On February 6, a bomb disguised as an aerosol can wounded a
 municipal garbage worker in Stinatz, which is mainly populated by Austrians of
 Croatian descent. On June 9, a letter bomb injured two women in Linz who worked
 for an agency that provides match-making services for East Europeans and Asians
 seeking Austrian spouses. That same day a colleague who opened a letter addressed
 to a black Austrian-born television moderator was also injured by a letter bomb. On
 October 16, letter bombs in Stronsdorf and Poysdorf wounded a Syrian-born Aus-
 trian citizen and the founder of a refugee aid agency. Security forces have not yet
 apprehended the perpetrators of these acts of violence.
 On December 11, two of a total of four letter bombs exploded in a public mailbox
 in the Styrian city of Graz. The letter bombs were addressed to the mother of a pro-
 foreigner activist, to an Indian-born Austrian couple, and to the Vienna office of the
 United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. Police could not decipher one ad-
 dress. A passerby suffered light ear injunies.
 Two Austrians accused of complicity in a 1993 letter bomb campaign were acquit-
 ted of the charges in December. They admitted ne-Nazi activities, for which they
 were sentenced to 3- and 5-year prison terms.
 The Interior Ministry described the rightwing extremist groups as not unified, but
 increasingly secretive and isolated. At the same time, they are increasing their use
 of computers and international electronic networks. In November, the Justice and
 Interior Ministries developed a joint proposal for legislation to expand the use of in-
 vestigative tools, such as electronic eavesdropping and merging of databases, and
 to introduce protections for defendants and witnesses who cooperate with investiga-
 tive authorities. The proposal is expected to be considered by the new Parliament
 in 1996. In addition to legislative measures to counter criminal activities, the Inte-
 rior Ministry reported that it initiated interministerial cooperative educational pro-
 grams aimed at students and teaching staffs.
 Religious Minorities.-One Jewish cemetery was vandalized during the year. The
 annual report of the London Institute for Jewish Affairs expressed concern over the
 progress made by neo-Nazi organizations in Austria and elsewhere in Europe, but
 also noted the resolve with which the Government and the opposition ,parties fight
 "attacks against the principles of democracy and against racial violence.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association-Workers have the right to form and join unions
 without prior authorization, under general constitutional guarantees of freedom of
 association. In practice, trade unions have an important and independent voice in
 the political, social, and economic life of the country. Fifty-two percent of the work
 force was organized in 14 national unions, all belonging to the Austrian Trade
 Union Federation (OGB), which has a highly centralized leadership structure. Indi-
 vidual unions and the OGB are independent of government orpolitical-party control,
 although formal factions within these organizations are closely allied with political
 parties.
 Although the right to strike is not explicitly provided for in the Constitution or
 in national legislation, it is universally recognized. Historically, strikes have been
 comparatively few and usually of short duration. The only strike during the year
 involved 60 metal industry workers, who struck for 2 days in protest over the firing
 of 2 shop stewards. A major reason for the record of labor peace is the unofficial
 system of "social partnership" among labor, management, and government. At the
 
 
 772
 center of the system is the Joint Parity Commission for Wages and Prices, which
 has an important voice on major economic questions.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Unions have the right to or-
 ganize and barain collectively. Almost all large companies, private or state-owned,
 are organized. Worker councils operate at the enterprise level, and workers are enti-
 tled by law to elect one-third of the members of the supervisory boards of major
 companies. Collective agreements covering wages, benefits, and working conditions
 are negotiated by the 0GB with the National Chamber of Commerce andits assoca-
 tions, which represent the employers. Wage and price policy guidelines are set by
 the Joint Parity Commission. A 1973 law obliges employers in enterprises with more
 than five employees to prove that job dismissals are not motivated by antiunion dis-
 crimination. Employers found guilty of this are required to reinstate workers. Labor
 and business representatives remain in disagreement over how to comply with the
 -obligation under the International Labor Organization's Convention 98 to provide
 legal protection to employees against arbitrary dismissals in firms with five employ-
 ees or fewer.
 Typically, legal disputes between employer and employees regarding job-related
 matters are handled by a special arbitration court for social affairs. The 0GB is ex-
 clusively responsible for collective bargaining. The leadership of the chambers and
 the OB are elected democratically.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced labor is prohibited by law
 and is not practiced.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The minimum legal working age
 is 15 years. The law is effectively enforced by the Labor Inspectorate of the Ministry
 of Social Affairs.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-There is no legislated national minimum wage.
 Instead, nationwide collective bargaining agreements set minimums by job classi-
 fication for each industry. The generally accepted unofficial minimum gross income
 is $14,000 per year. Every worker is entitled to a variety of generous social benefits.
 The average citizen has a high standard of living, and even the minimum wages
 are sufficient to permit a decent living for workers and their families.
 Although the legal workweek has been established at 40 hours since 1975, more
 than 50 percent of the labor force is covered by collective bargaining agreements
 that set the workweek at 38 or 382 hours.
 Extensive legislation, regularly enforced by the Labor Inspectorate of the Ministry
 of Social Affairs, provides for mandatory occupational health and safety standards.
 A law that became effective on January 1, 1995, extends such protection to all work-
 ers. Workers may file complaints anonymously with the Labor Inspectorate, which
 may bring suit against the employer on behalf of the employee, but this option is
 rarely exercised, as workers normally rely instead on the Chambers of Labor, which
 file suits on their behalf.
