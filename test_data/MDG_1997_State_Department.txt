 MADAGASCAR
 Madagascar held its second presidential election under the 1992 Constitution in
 December 1996, following the impeachment and removal of then-President Albert
 Zafy earlier in the year. The winner, former Second Republic President Didier
 Ratsiraka, took office in February. The election was widely accepted as free and fair.
 Under the Constitution, power is divided among: The President; the Prime Minister
 and his Government, anda bicameral legislature (Senate and National Assembly).
 A number of institutions provided for in the Constitution, including the Senate, an
 independent judiciary, some decentralized local governments, and new courts that
 require Senate appointments had still not been established by year's end. Legisla-
 tive elections scheduled for August did not take place because of new requirements
 that voters possess national identity cards. These elections are planned for March
 1998.
 The State Secretary of the Ministry of Interior for Public Security-and, under the
 State Secretary, the National Police-are responsible for law and order in urban
 areas. The Ministry of Armed Forces comprises the National Army, including army
 troops, air force, navy, and the gendarmerie. The gendarmerie has primary respon-
 sibility for security except in major cities, and is assisted in some areas by regular
 army units in operations against bandit gangs and cattle thieves. Military force
 strength continued to decline slowly, dropping below 20,000 troops. There are also
 traditional village-level law enforcement groups or vigilance committees, known as
 dina. There were occasional reports that police and gendarmes committed human
 rights abuses, as did the dina.
 Madagascar is a very poor country. The economy relies heavily on agriculture;
 production of coffee and vanilla fell further, but shrimp exports rose. Rice, the major
 staple, remained at near self-sufficiency. Manufacturing in export processing facili-
 ties increased modestly. The smuggling of vanilla, gold, precious stones, and cattle
 continued to be major problems. Overall economic performance improved, but three-
 fourths of the population of 13 million still live in poverty. Foreign economic assist-
 ance remains a major source of national income. Living standards are low, with av-
 erage per capita gross domestic product estimated at $230 per year. Annual infla-
 tion stabilized at about 9 percent during 1996 and 1997. Unemployment and under,
 employment, especially among youth, remained high. The Government implemented
 a program of economic reform and structural adjustment to foster a stronger market
 economy.
 The human rights situation improved somewhat from 1996. There was very little
 political violence. However, there were occasional reports of police brutality against
 criminal suspects and detainees, as well as instances of arbitrary arrest and deten-
 tion. Prison conditions remained harsh and often life threatening. In some prisons,
 women experienced abuse, including rape. A total of 62 new judges were appointed
 in an effort to relieve the overburdened judiciary. Nonetheless, suspects were often
 held in lengthy pretrial detention that often exceeded the maximum sentence for the
 alleged offense. Dina imposed summary justice in rural areas where the Govern-
 ment's presence was weak, but authorities increased their efforts to bring dna
 under closer regulation and scrutiny. Women continued to face some societal dis-
 crimination.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political
 killings by government forces. However, harsh prison conditions and the authorities'
 failure to provide adequate food and medical treatment contributed to an undeter-
 mined number of deaths in custody (see Section 1.c.).
 Village dina continued to mete out summary justice, including executions, to com-
 bat rising rural banditry.
 There were no developments in several pre-1997 incidents: The 1994 beating
 death of radio journalist Victor Randrianirina, who had allegedly reported on sap-
 hire smuggling; the deaths of unarmed civilians by security forces in 1991-93; the
 deaths of more than 30 demonstrators who were killed by the Presidential Guard
 
 
 at Iavoloha Palace on August 10, 1991; and a March 31, 1992, incident in which
 soldiers killed 6 pro-Ratsiraka supporters at the national constitutional convention.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution specifically provides for the inviolability of the person. However,
 there were occasional reports that police or members of other security forces mis-
 treated prisoners or detainees. There were also instances of dina trials in which tor-
 ture was used to elicit confessions.
 Prison conditions are harsh and life threatening. Prisoners' diets are inadequate,
 and family members must augment daily rations. Prisoners without relatives nearby
 sometimes live for days without food. Prison cells average less than 1 square meter
 of space per inmate. The authorities do not provide adequate medical care. The pris-
 on population suffers a range of medical problems that are rarely treated, including
 manutrition, infections, malaria, and tuberculosis. These conditions have caused an
 unknown number of deaths.
 Women in prisons suffer abuses, as do the children who are sometimes confined
 with them. Gender segregation is not absolute, and some rapes by other prisoners
 were reported.
 The Government permits prison visits by the International Committee of the Red
 Cross, religious an nongovernmental organizations (NGO's), lawyers' associations
 investigating excessive pretrial detention, and investigative journalists.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution provides for due process
 for accused persons, but in practice the authorities do not always observe legal safe-
 guards against arbitrary arrest and detention. In particular, excessive investigative
 detention of suspects results in denial of due process.
 According to law, a criminal suspect must be charged, bound over, or released
 within 3 days of arrest. An arrest warrant may be obtained but is not always re-
 quired. According to the Penal Code, defendants in ordinary criminal cases have the
 right to be informed of the charges against them, must be charged formally within
 the specified time permitted, and must be allowed access to an attorney. Court-ap-
 pointed counsel is provided for indigent persons accused of crimes that carry a mini-
 mum 5-year jail sentence. An attorney or the accused may request bail immediately
 after arrest, after being formally charged, or during the appeal process, but it is
 rarely granted in the case of violent crimes.
 About 70 percent of persons held in custody were in pretrial detention. Despite
 existing legal safeguards, investigative detention often exceeds 1 year, and 3 or 4
 years' detention is common, even for crimes for which the maximum penalty may
 be 2 years or less. The accused may waityears in prison only to be ultimately exon-
 erated in court. The Ministry of Justice began a pilot program to reduce excessive
 pretrial detention through case reviews and expedited judgments. There are an esti-
 mated 20,000 persons in pretrial detention.
 Although the law allows detainees to sue the Government for damages in cases
 of unlawful detention, no such suits were reported. By law persons accused of sub-
 versive activity may be detained incommunicado for 15 days and are subject to in-
 definite detention if considered necessary by the Government; however, this law was
 not invoked during the year.
 The Government does not use forced exile.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution provides for an independent judi-
 ciary; however, implementing legislation has not been passed. The establishment of
 a number of courts also provided for in the Constitution awaits the long-delayed in-
 auguration of the Senate.
 The judiciary has three levels of jurisdiction: Local courts for civil and criminal
 cases carrying limited fines and sentences; the Court of Appeals, which includes a
 criminal court, for cases carrying sentences of 5 years or more; and the Supreme
 Court. The judiciary also includes courts designed to try specific kinds of cases such
 as cattle theft. The High Constitutional Court is an autonomous court that under-
 takes technical reviews of laws, decrees, and ordinances and certifies election re-
 sults.
 While awaiting reform, the judiciary remained under the Ministry of Justice. Lack
 of internal controls and relatively low salaries for magistrates encourage corruption.
 With judicial reform stagnated, the pace of court proceedings has slowed and cre-
 ated a huge backlog, contributing to the problem of excessive investigative deten-
 tion.
 Trials are public, and defendants have the right to an attorney, to be present at
 the trial, to confront witnesses, and to present evidence. Defendants enjoy a pre-
 sumption of innocence under the Penal Code.
 The right of traditional dna village institutions to protect property and public
 order is codified in the Constitution as well as earlier laws. Dina adjudicate or arbi-
 
 
 trate civil disputes within and between villages. Dina are also established in some
 urban areas. In practice, dina increasingly deal with criminal cases because of in-
 creasing crime, the physical isolation of many rural areas, and the ineffectiveness
 of the police and the judiciary outside urban centers. Dina punishments were at
 times severe and in some cases included capital punishment.
 Decisions by dina are not subject to codified safeguards for the accused, but in
 some instances may be challenged at the appeals court level. Some cases have also
 been referred to the Office of the Mediator (ombudsman), which investigates and
 may seek redress from formal judicial authorities. An interministerial committee
 that includes the Ministries of Justice, Interior, and Armed Forces was established
 to improve surveillance of dina and assure their adherence to law. The Ministry of
 Justice has moved away from its earlier permissive approach to dina and empha-
 sized their subordination under the formal judicial system.
 The Government continued to combat crime and lawlessness in isolated rural re-
 gions by augmenting the gendarmerie-traditionally responsible for law and order
 in rural areas-with army units.
 Military courts are integrated into the civil judicial system, and differ only in the
 kinds of cases tried and in the inclusion of military officers on jury panels. Such
 courts have jurisdiction over some cases involving national security, including acts
 allegedly threatening the nation and its political leaders; invasion by foreign forces;
 and rioting that could lead to the overthrow of the Government. Defendants in mili-
 tary cases, as in civil law, enjoy an appeals process that reexamines points of law
 rather than the facts of the case. A civilian magistrate, usually joined on the bench
 by a panel of military officers, presides over military trials.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution prohibits such practices, government authorities generally respect
 these prohibitions, and violations are subject to effective legal sanction.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech
 and of the press, and the Government respects these rights in practice. The judici-
 ary functions effectively in this area. The press is independent; journalists who in-
 vestigated prison conditions provided reports in the print and electronic media dur-
 ing the year.
 Academic freedom is respected.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 these rights, and the Government respects them in practice.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the
 Government respects this right in practice.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Constitution provides for these rights, and the Government re-
 * spects them in practice. However, fear of crime effectively restricts travel to some
 places, especially at night. For foreign residents, the requirement for exit visas was
 removed late in the year.
 The Government generally cooperates closely with the United Nations High Com-
 missioner for Refugees in processing the small number of refugees or asylum seek-
 ers. However, the Government has failed to resolve the status of 54 Ethiopian asy-
 lum seekers who have been in Madagascar since 1994. There were no reports of
 forced expulsion of those with recognized or pending claims to refugee status. The
 issue of provision of first asylum has never arisen.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens have the right to change their government through direct universal suf-
 frage and secret ballot. Didier Ratsiraka was elected to a 5-year term as President
 in 1996 in the second election held under the 1992 Constitution. In 1993, 138 mem-
 bers of the National Assembly were elected to 4-year terms, which were extended
 by 6 months in 1997 by a High Constitutional Court decision. Local mayors and
 councils were elected in 1995. A referendum to amend the Constitution was also
 held in 1995. The 1993, 1995, and 1996 elections were generally free and fair.
 Under the Constitution, the President has primary responsibility for national de-
 fense and foreign policy, while the Prime Minister is head of government and re-
 sponsible for domestic policy. The President selects the Prime Minister under provi-
 sions of the 1995 referendum that amended the Constitution. The Prime Minister
 is appointed when a new National Assembly is elected or upon a vacancy. The Con-
 stitution gives the President, acting in conjunction with the Council of Ministers,
 the right to dissolve the National Assembly if there have been two governmental
 
 
 196
 crises in the previous 18 months. The High Constitutional Court must rule that
 such crises have occurred. The Prime Minister is required to submit his resignation,
 as is the Cabinet, if a motion of censure is passed by a two-thirds majority of the
 National Assembly.
 The Senate had not yet been created by year's end. Under the current Constitu-
 tion, two-thirds of the Senate's members are to be selected by local, department, and
 regional government officials, while one-third of the members are to be appointed
 by the President. These provisions are widely expected to be modified by constitu-
 tional referendum before the Senate is installed. Although local government elec-
 tions were held in November 1995, the departmental and regional elections sched-
 uled for 1996 were postponed after the impeachment of then-President Zafy neces-
 sitated an early presidential election.
 There are no legal impediments to the participation of women in government or
 politics, but in practice women are underrepresented in both areas. The Government
 of 31 ministers and state secretaries appointed in March includes 5 women. Only
 6 percent of National Assembly deputies are women. However, nearly half the mag-
 istrates are women.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 A number of human rights groups operate without government restriction, inves-
 tigating and publishing their findings on human rights cases. Government officials
 are usually cooperative and responsive to their views. The Constitution provides for
 an independent-office to promote and protect human rights. In 1994 the National
 Assembly assigned that role to the Office of the Mediator (ombudsman), which relies
 on moral suasion to correct abuses. The Office publishes axinual reports on its activi-
 ties and distributes brochures to educate citizens on their rights and responsibil-
 ities. The reports outline the rights of women and children and bring public atten-
 tion to the potential for human rights violations by dna.
 The Government is open to visits by international human rights groups and to
 domestic and international election observers. A number of international organiza-
 tions sent observers for the first and second rounds of the 1996 presidential election.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution prohibits all forms of discrimination and outlaws groups that ad-
 vocate ethnic or religious segregation. There are no government institutions specifi-
 cally designated to enforce these antidiscrimination provisions.
 Women.-Violence against women is not widespread. Police and other legal au-
 thorities intervene if physical abuse is reported. There is no law dealing specifically
 with violence against women except with regard to rape. Spouses can be tried for
 nonrape abuses, generally under civil law.
 There is some societal discrimination against women, particularly in urban areas,
 where many women manage or own businesses or hold management positions in
 state industries. A number of nongovernmental organizations (NGO's) focus on civic
 education of women and girls to assure that they understand their rights and legal
 protections and avail themselves of these safeguards.
 The national police recruited a significant number of women, and the National As-
 sembly passed a law authorizing women to attend service academies. NGO's led by
 women were highly influential in national debate on citizen empowerment, the
 rights of the disabled, and the rule of law.
 Under a 1990 law, wives have an equal voice in selecting the location of a married
 couple's residence, and they generally receive an equitable share of common prop-
 erty on divorce. Widows with children inherit half of joint marital property. A tradi-
 tion known as "the customaiy third" is occasionally observed in some areas. Under
 this custom, the wife has a rght to only one-third of a couple's joint holdings. How-
 ever, a widow receives a pension, while a widower does not.
 Children.-While official expenditures on children's welfare are low, the Govern-
 ment has maintained the spending levels of the Ministries of Health and Education
 despite increasing fiscal austerity. These expenditures are not sufficient to maintain
 an adequate level of public services under current economic conditions. The Govern-
 ment provides education through the secondary or vocational level, and it is compul-
 sory through the age of 14. However, attendance at primary schools is estimated
 to have declined to about 48 percent of primary school-age children from approxi-
 mately 70 percent in 1996.
 There is no societal pattern of abuse of children.
 People With Disabilities.-There is no systematic discrimination against disabled
 persons in employment, education, or in the provision of other state services. There
 
 
 is no law mandating access to buildings for people with disabilities. One NGO,
 Fondation Ikoriantsoa, proposed a law to define the rights of the disabled, which
 the Government submitted to the National Assembly for consideration.
 National/RaciallEthnic Minorities.-The Malagasy, who are of mixed Malayo-
 Polynesian, African, and Arabic heritage, include 18 distinct groups differing in re-
 gonal and ancestral affiliation. Although there are some linguistic differences, near-
 yall speak a dialect of the Malagasy language. None of these groups constitutes
 a majority of the population. There are significant minority populations of Chinese
 and Indo-Pakistani heritage, as well as a large number of resident French citizens.
 A long history of military conquest and political consolidation raised the political
 and economic status of highland ethnic groups of Asian origin above that of coastal
 groups of more African ancestry. Centralized administration and economic planning
 since independence reinforced the concentration of economic and political power in
 the central highlands, where the capital is located. These policies feed enduring ten-
 sion between coastal and highland peoples. Ethnic, caste, and regional solidarity are
 often factors in hiring practices.
 An Indo-Pakistani community has resided in Madagascar since the early part of
 the century. This community, traditionally focused on commerce, now numbers
 about 20,000 persons. Few have made successful claims to Malagasy nationality,
 which is customarily acquired through a native-born Malagasy mother. Indo-Paki-
 stani merchants are widely mistrusted. In past years, their shops have been looted
 during civil disturbances.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution and the 1995 Labor Code provide
 workers in the public and private sectors with the legal right to establish and join
 labor unions of their choosing without prior authorization. However, essential-serv-
 ice workers, including police and soldiers, may not form unions. Unions are required
 to register with the Government, and registration is routinely granted. About 80
 percent of the labor force of 5 million is engaged in agrarian production. Union
 members account for only about 5 percent of the total labor force.
 There are a number of trade union federations, many formerly affiliated with po-
 litical parties. Neither public nor private sector unions have played a major political
 or economic role in recent years. The Government exercises very limited control over
 organized labor.
 The Labor Code and the Constitution include the right to strike, including in ex-
 port processing (free trade) zones (EPZ's). Workers performing essential services
 have a recognized but restricted right to strike. In practice, short strikes took place
 without reprisal. The Code requires workers to exhaust conciliation, mediation, and
 arbitration procedures before striking, but has not in practice been a significant de-
 terrent to legal strikes.
 Short and generally nondisruptive strikes by, for example, civil servants, trans-
 port workers, and other professionals took place over fiscal and administrative prob-
 lems in many cities. Government workers and university students also called strikes
 to protest austerity measures.
 The International Labor Organization (ILO) has noted a number of instances in
 which the Government has failed to bring law and regulation into conformity with
 existing conventions or otherwise submit texts for ILO review, includingthose ad-
 dressing forced labor, freedom of association, guarding of machinery, hygiene in
 commerce and offices, and weight limits. In most instances, these failures indicated
 legislative inertia rather than abuses.
 Unions freely join and participate in international bodies and may form federa-
 tions or confederations.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Both the Labor Code and the
 Constitution provide for the right to bargain collectively. The Code states that col-
 lective bargaining may be undertaken between management and labor on the initia-
 tive of either party. In fact, collective bargaining agreements are rare. The Govern-
 ment is often involved in the bargaining process, in part because of the large per-
 centage of public employees who are union members.
 The Labor Code prohibits discrimination by employers against labor organizers,
 union members, and unions. In the event of antiunion activity, unions or their mem-
 bers may file a grievance against the employer in civil court. Labor laws apply uni-
 formly throughout the country, including in the EPZ's. However, the Government's
 enforcement of labor laws and regulations is hampered by lack of staff and financial
 resources. The 27 Ministry of Labor inspectors visit industrial work sites with some
 regularity but most often those located near the capital.
 
 
 There are several EPZ's which are, in practice, firms operating under special im-
 port and export rules. Such firms are required to follow all pertinent labor law and
 regulation, including minimum wage laws.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Labor Code explicitly pro-
 hibits forced labor, and it is not known to occur. The Government prohibits forced
 and bonded labor by children and enforces this prohibition effectively.
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment.-The
 Labor Code defines a child as any person under the age of 18 years. The legal mini-
 mum age of employment is 14 years, and work by individuals under the age of 18
 is prohibited at sites where there is apparent and imminent danger. The Govern-
 ment also enforces child labor laws in the small formal economic sector through in-
 spectors of the Ministry of Civil Service, Labor, and Social Laws. In the large agri-
 cultural sector, young children work with parents on family farms at much younger
 ages. In urban areas, many children work as petty traders and casual transport
 workers, or are beggars.
 The law prohibits forced and bonded child labor, and the authorities enforce this
 prohibition effectively (see Section 6.c.).
 Education is compulsory to the age of 14. In practice, however, only about 48 per-
 cent of children attend primary school.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The Labor Code and implementing legislation
 prescribe working conditions and wages, which are enforced by the Ministry of Civil
 Service, Labor, and Social Laws. The law makes separate provisions for agricultural
 and nonagricultural labor.
 The minimum wage is set by the Government. Other wages are set by employers
 with individual employees, sometimes below the standarf minimum wage. When
 there is a failure to reach agreement, the Ministry of Labor convenes a Committee
 of Employment Inspectors to resolve the matter. If this process fails, the committee
 refers the matter to the chairman of the Court of Appeals for final arbitration. No
 such cases reached the Court of Appeals during the year. The minimum wage is $28
 (frog 151,000) per month. This wage does not provide a decent living for a worker
 and family and must be supplemented by subsistence agriculture, petty trade, sup-
 port from relatives, or employment of other family members. Minimum wage rates
 are not always respected, since high unemployment and widespread poverty lead
 workers to accept wages at lower levels.
 The standard legal workweek in nonagricultural and service industries is 40
 hours, and 42/2 hours in agriculture. At least one 24-hour rest period each work-
 week is mandated. The Labor Code sets rules and standards for worker safety and
 work site sanitation. Ministry of Civil Service, Labor and Social Laws officials mon-
 itor labor conditions. However, they are usually able to cover only the capital region
 effectively. If violators do not remedy cited violations within the time allowed, they
 may be legally sanctioned or assessed administrative penalties. In some sectors,
 safety equipment is not used due to the expense of protective clothing and other
 safety devices. There have been no published reports of occupational health hazards
 or accident trends. There is no explicit right for workers to leave dangerous work-
 places without jeopardizing their employment.
