 EQUATORIAL GUINEA
 Since the overthrow of the oppressive Macias dictatorship in
 August 1979, Equatorial Guinea has had a military government
 that describes itself as dedicated to national reconstruc-
 tion. The government has stated its commitments to human
 rights, the principles of international law, and the
 Charters of the United Nations and the Organization of Afri-
 can Unity. While all the military men holding cabinet ap-
 pointments and many civil servants had ties with the Macias
 regime at one time, many also suffered personally from the
 excesses of that regime. The civil service also includes
 Guineans who have returned from foreign exile. As part of
 its program for national reconstruction, the new government
 has reestablished a legal frame of reference while it builds
 new legal institutions and procedures. Decree Law No. 4 of
 April 1980 states that those penal, civil, mercantile, ad-
 ministrative, labor and military laws in effect before in-
 dependence in 1968 will remain in force until new laws and
 regulations are passed, provided that pre-independence laws
 do not conflict with legislation passed since the present
 government assumed office in August 1979.
 Until the military government has completed the process of
 national economic, social, and administrative reconstruction,
 it does not intend to permit political parties to function.
 The government has stated that the destruction of the
 country's economy and social services under Macias, the
 almost total lack of government revenues and trained person-
 nel, and dependence on foreign assistance to restore agri-
 cultural production as well as health and education facil-
 ities, precluded extension of full political and civil
 rights. On the government's second anniversary in August
 1981, President Obiang Nguema restated the government's
 dedication to democracy and its intent to hold a referendum
 on a draft constitution some time before August 1982. Mean-
 while, the president remains concerned and apprehensive over
 the security challenge posed by the continuing Soviet, Cuban
 and North Korean presence. Although President Obiang has
 made a commitment in principle to human rights, the reality
 in Equatorial Guinea is that the government is staffed by
 many holdovers from the Macias regime, and some human rights
 violations persist.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom From:
 a. Torture:
 The government has promised "physical integrity of persons"
 and the inviolability of all Guinean citizens.* Whether
 this is complied with in practice is not known. There is no
 reliable information that torture, consistently used by the
 former regime, is still used.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 President Obiang has stated that "no one must suffer slavery,
 1orture, or cruel, degrading or inhuman treatment."   In
 contrast to the barbaric record of its predecessor the new
 
 
 80
 government does not systematically practice such treatment
 or punishment. Physical punishment of convicted criminals
 is not known to be administered now, as it was under Macias;
 however, there are occasional reports of beating during
 detention. In September 1979, former President Macias, to-
 gether with six collaborators, was executed after a public
 trial which was described as fair by foreign observers, in-
 cluding a representative of the International Commission of
 Jurists. A former government official also was found guilty
 of killings under the Macias Regime and executed. In June
 1981 at least 24 military personnel and civilians were tried
 for plotting against the regime. Several international
 organizations were invited to send observers to the trial,
 but none are known to have done so. One person was sen-
 tenced to death, 15 to prison terms ranging from 6 months to
 30 years, and at least 8 were acquitted. Prison conditions
 are harsh, given the government's lack of resources to im-
 prove the prisons inherited from the Macias regime.
 c. Disappearances:
 No information has been received that secret arrests and
 detentions continue in Equatorial Guinea, as practiced pre-
 viously under the Macias regime. There have been isolated
 but reliable reports of arrests without a warrant. In 1981
 a government official, reportedly abducted from his home and
 imprisoned without a.warrant, returned to his home in the
 capital city.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest And Imprisonment:
 The government has announced the-release of all political
 prisoners held by the previous regime, and has indicated
 that it is detaining no political prisoners, except those
 sentenced to prison terms in September 1979 as Macias col-
 laborators. Perhaps as many as 100 had been arrested in
 April 1981 and held for questioning for as much as three
 weeks in connection with the alleged coup before being
 released. However, there are no indications that the regime
 systematically practices arbitrary arrest and imprisonment.
 President Obiang Nguema has stated that no one should be
 arbitrarily detained, imprisoned or exiled.
 Decree Law No. 8 of June 1980 states that those who commit
 acts against public order must either be turned over to the
 "judicial authorities" or released within 72 hours. Occas-
 ional reports of arbitrary arrest and imprisonment probably
 reflect inability of the:government to control fully all of
 its officials, rather than a sanctioned policy as in the
 Macias regime. It was reliably reported that the government
 officials responsible for one such arrest were severely
 disciplined as a result.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial:
 The current court system in Equatorial Guinea appears to be
 a combination of traditional, civil and military justice.
 A representative of the United Nations Commission on Human
 Rights was told in November 1979 that civil cases were tried
 by traditional chiefs and/or civilian judges for the more
 serious cases. Criminal cases come under the exclusive
 jurisdiction of the military authorities. Macias and his
 co-defendants were given a public trial, provided with coun-
 
 
 81
 sel, and informed of the charges against them. The tribunal,
 which applied Spanish law, was composed of three military and
 two civilian members. Military courts are now said to have
 jurisdiction only over military personnel. According to
 security officials, defendants are permitted access to
 counsel at all times, although instances have been reported
 where the right to counsel was not in fact extended.
 f. Invasion of the Home:
 Decree Law No. 8 of June 1980 states that government author-
 ities "may not enter or remain in the domicile of a private
 individual without his consent and without a legal order,"
 except, among other circumstances, when it is necessary to
 facilitate the prosecution of persons accused of crimes and
 when the public order is seriously disturbed. There are
 reports of non-compliance with Decree Law No. 8.
 2. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and
 Assembly.
 Decree Law No. 11 of November 1979 makes specific reference
 to the "right of information." The government owns and
 operates the country's few radio and television stations.
 The semi-weekly newspaper, "Ebano," which began publication
 in August 1980, is no longer published. These media do not
 criticize the government and opposition viewpoints have no
 public channel of expression. In August 1981 a government
 ban was placed on certain Spanish newspapers because of
 negative reporting on the present regime, but that ban was
 lifted two months later. A strong critic of the Equatorial
 Guinean government has been President Obiang himself. He
 has attacked ministers by name on radio for corruption. On
 television he also recently fired, for corruption, the
 directors of the Central Bank, who were present. An.August
 1979 decree authorized reopening of churches of all religions
 recognized in Equatorial Guinea, and churches are again
 functioning. The new government has not made specific com-
 mitments on other civil and political liberties but it has
 warned those returning from exile that political factionalism
 will not be tolerated. There is no functioning trade union
 movement in Equatorial Guinea.
 b. Freedom of Movement within the Country,
 Foreign Travel, Emigration and Repatriation.
 There are no known restrictions on the local populace as
 concerns travel within Equatorial Guinea. Travel abroad is
 limited by the shortage of foreign exchange. The government
 recognized the rights of volpntary repatriation when, in a
 general amnesty decreed in October 1979, it invited exiles
 "to return without concern for being persecuted or punished
 for having abandoned Equatorial Guinea." Some anti-regime
 exiles continue to reside in Spain and elsewhere in Europe.
 Guineans are no longer seeking refuge outside the country
 and there are no foreign refugees known to have sought
 asylum in Equatorial Guinea.

 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process.
 The new military government of Equatorial Guinea is dictator-
 ial in nature, and rules by decree. The president and many
 cabinet members are military officers. Government ministries
 are staffed by civilians and military officers. Despite its
 commitment to restore democracy, the government has indicated
 that political parties and activities will not be permitted
 until progress has been achieved toward national economic
 reconstruction. The president is also concerned with securing
 and maintaining the gains which have been made since the
 overthrow of the Macias regime. He views Soviet, Cuban, and
 Libyan activities in Equatorial Guinea as a threat to those
 gains. Accordingly, he expelled the Libyan diplomatic
 mission in 1981 and has requested that the Soviet Union reduce
 its presence from over 100 persons to 15. As of the end of
 the year the Soviet Mission had not complied with this request.
 Mass political participation, opposition groups, and popular
 suffrage have been deferred. The president recently announced
 his intention to have a referendum on a new constitution
 before August, 1982.
 3. Government Attitude and Record Regarding International
 and Non-Governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights.
 The military government invited representatives of the Inter-
 national Commission of Jurists to attend the trial of former
 President Macias and accepted a request from the United
 Nations Commission on Human Rights to evaluate the human
 right6 situation in Equatorial Guinea. The International
 Commission of Jurists' reports on the Macias trial was issued
 in Geneva in December 1979. A special.rapporteur represent-
 ing the United Nations Human Rights Commission visited
 Equatorial Guinea in November 1979. His report, issued in
 February 1980, indicated that the government did not cooperate
 fully with the commission and interferred to some extent with
 its mission. He returned for a second visit in late November
 1980, and his second report to the commission stated that
 considerable progress had been made, but that much remained to
 be done in 1981.
 The government-invited the United Nations Human Rights Commis-
 sion and Amnesty International to send observers to treason
 and corruption trials held in Malabo, June, 1981. Neither
 organization received a list of defendants or details on
 the nature of the charges and trials and neither organization
 sent a representative. There are no-organizations in Equa-
 torial Guinea which observe, report and contest human rights
 violations. Equatorial Guinea does not participate in any
 regional human rights bodies.
 4. Economic and Social Circumstances:
 The government has repeatedly stated its commitment to fulfill
 its people's basic economic needs. However, as a result of
 the systematic misrule by the Macias regime and the lack of
 resources available to the new regime, economic and social
 progress has been limited.
 The population of Equatorial Guinea is estimated at 300,000
 of which about 46,000 are expatriates, mainly Nigerians
 working in forestry and agricultural plantations. Infant
 mortality is believed to be high, and life expectancy is
 estimated to average 44 years for males and 47 for females.
 
 
 83
 The gross domestic product (GDP) is 63.7 million dollars and
 per capita income is about $ 212. Agriculture provides the
 largest share of GDP followed by mining, construction and
 services. There were 50,000 pupils in primary school
 attendance in 1970, and 44,000 in 1980. School enrollment
 is claimed to be 90 percent and the overall literacy rate
 claimed is 38 percent. The standard of living, health
 services and education facilities are substandard.
 The agricultural, financial, and administrative policies (or
 lack thereof) pursued by the Macias regime led to the exodus
 of Spanish expatriates, Nigerian contract workers and large
 numbers of nationals, including many trained personnel.
 This had a drastic effect on the country's export crops,
 cocoa, coffee and timber. Severe restrictions on imports led
 to a halt in the activity of other sectors of the economy.
 Thus, the economy, which had recorded growth rates of 10
 percent in the period between 1962-1966, declined sharply in
 the 1970s to a negative growth rate. After 1975 civil servants
 went unpaid and most public services ceased to function.
 Revitalization of cocoa, coffee and timber production remains
 the key to economic reconstruction.
 The government recognizes the need for austere administration.
 The 1980 budget decree allowed for only 3,000 civil servants
 with minimum monthly salaries of between $30 and $54. This,
 however, constituted two-thirds of total projected government
 spending. Minimum wages have also been instituted in other
 sectors of the economy at about 30-45 dollars a month.
