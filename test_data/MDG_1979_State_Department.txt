 MADAGASCAR
 President Ratsiraka's four-year old government describes
 itself as revolutionary and socialist and has said its
 main objective is the full achievement of'Madagascar's inde-
 pendence after many years of colonial rule. It has delib-
 erately loosened its earlier close and almost exclusive ties
 with the Western countries and has asserted increased
 government control over the national economy. The estab-
 lishment of close relations with socialist countries and
 the nationalization of large foreign owned businesses have
 been further corollaries of these policies. In its foreign
 relations, the government has lined up with the more radical
 countries of the Third World and taken a militant "anti-
 imperialist" stance. Internally, it has decentralized the
 administration. Economically, its newly established
 socialist policy is intended to expand production and social
 services and to reduce income disparities.
 The break with the past represented by the new policies
 has antagonized certain elements of the population, par-
 ticularly the beneficiaries of the old order which ruled in
 Madagascar from 1960 and 1975. The government regularly
 denounces supporters of the former regime and often blames
 its difficulties on "sabotage" by them, although it has not
 otherwise acted against them. There are no political
 prisoners, and leaders of the previous government are at
 liberty. Political activity is, however, restricted to
 specified organizations which supported the establishment of
 the new regime in 1975, and the government exercises full
 control over the information media. Ethnic frictions, poor
 law enforcement practices, political decentralization, and
 the government's egalitarian propaganda have resulted
 in occasional serious breakdowns in law and order in
 which lives and property have been lost, and a climate of
 insecurity persists in certain urban and rural areas.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 Torture is forbidden by law, but there have been occasional
 reports of physical abuse of prisoners arrested for sus-
 pected activities against the state. The use of torture
 appears to be rare, however, and is contrary to the humane
 tradition of the people.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Although the prisons are crowded and conditions are primi-
 tive, mistreatment of prisoners is forbidden by regulations
 and does not appear to be a significant problem.
 c. Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 Although there are virtually no political prisoners in
 Madagascar, individuals suspected of activity against the
 state can legally be arrested and held incommunicado for
 three weeks. Occasional long delays in the administration
 
 
 112
 of justice are encountered, primarily due to an overworked
 and inefficient judicial system.
 d. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The Constitution provides that all courts must be open to
 the public except in cases involving national defense
 matters or in trials of minors. Although juvenile cases
 are routinely heard in camera, the government prides itself
 on having others open to the public. The trials in Mada-
 gascar are generally fair. Departures from impartiality
 have usually involved light sentences for government offi-
 cials, slowness in getting cases to trial, and occasional
 lengthy detention of the accused. At least three Malagasy
 military officers and several foreigners have been in
 Malagasy prisons .without trial for periods of well over a
 year or more for suspected activities against the state.
 Civilians can be tried before military courts for crimes
 involving the external security of the state. This has
 occurred only twice in recent years, and in both instances
 the court appeared to follow legal procedures scrupulously
 and made decisions which were considered lenient in the
 context of the applicable legislation.
 e. Invasion of the Home
 Process servers may enter a private dwelling only during
 daylight hours. Police may enter at any time if in posses-
 sion of written orders from the Chief of Police or a
 high magistrate.
 2. Governmental Policies Relating to the Fulfillment
 of Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care
 and Education:
 The Charter of the Socialist Revolution, which is the
 government's basic policy document, sets idealistic goals
 to be achieved by the creation of a socialist economy.
 Development efforts are to be focused on improving the lot
 of previously underprivileged peoples and regions. At
 present the economic authorities are placing emphasis on
 increasing production rather than the expansion of social
 services or the reduction of income disparities. Although
 the government estimates that it now controls over 60 per-
 cent of the economy, this has had little effect on the
 lives of most Malagasy, 85 percent of whom exist on sub-
 sistence farming. The government receives considerable
 foreign assistance for economic development. However,
 development projects give primary emphasis to infrastruc-
 ture and industry. Moreover, development efforts are
 hampered by maladministration and, reportedly, corruption.
 Some elements of the urban population have suffered eco-
 nomically over the past several years when the government
 takeover of the economy discouraged private enterprise
 without replacing it by public investment. Standards of
 living differ widely between regions and economic classes.
 Some authorities have estimated that under optimum condi-
 tions Madagascar could support double the population it now
 has, and the availability of untilled land has mitigated the
 population pressure felt in other parts of the world.

 3. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Includ-
 ing:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and
 Assembly
 The Malagasy people, nearly half of whom are Christian,
 take their religion very seriously, and freedom of worship
 is fully respected by the government. Freedom of speech is
 generally respected, but anyone arguing too openly against
 the government's policies risks contravening Article 16 of
 the Constitution, which authorizes the suspension of the
 rights and liberties of individuals "impeding the advent of
 the socialist state." Freedom of assembly and freedom
 of the press are limited. Permits needed to hold meetings
 can be withheld under Article 16. In fact, no meeting
 to criticize the government has been held since early 1977,
 although students and labor groups occasionally demonstrate
 their displeasure with specific government measures affect-
 ing their interests. There is prepublication censorship of
 the press, causing any written criticism of the government
 or its socialist allies to be subtle and indirect.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel and Emigration
 Travel is not restricted within the country, but it has be-
 come increasingly difficult to obtain passports or author-
 ization to travel abroad except on business. Moreover, the
 government has sharply curtailed funds which may be taken
 out of the country, further limiting travel possibilities.
 Emigration is not significant but is limited by the same
 restrictions.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 The government prohibits political activity by any political
 organizations except those which supported the establishment
 of the pretent regime in a referendum held in December 1975.
 These organizations are specified by ordinance and their
 activities must be exercised only within the National
 Front for the Defense of the Revolution, of which they are
 the only members. The Front submitted a single list of
 candidates for the National Assembly elections of June 31,
 1977, the last national elections to be held.
 Labor unions may participate in the political process
 through affiliation with approved political organizations.
 Those unions choosing not to affiliate with such organiza-
 tions are not authorized to conduct political activities
 but can participate in collective bargaining. One of them
 was instrumental in leading a civil servant walkout and
 slowdown in August of 1979, which the government ended by
 the temporary detention of some union leaders, the forcible
 breakup of unauthorized meetings, and the firings of some
 workers combined with warnings of more to come if the others
 did not return to work.
 4. Government Attitude and Record Regarding Inter-
 national and Non-governmental Investigation of
 Alleged Violations of Human Rights:
 The government permitted an investigation by the Organiza-
 tion of African Unity (OAU) of the 1976 massacre of Comorian
 residents of the city of Majunga by a hostile Malagasy
 ethnic group. The investigators had freedom of movement and
 access to all persons concerned. Their report, said to be
 highly critical of the Malagasy security forces' performance,
 has not been disseminated by the OAU. It is doubtful that
 the government would be receptive to other organizations
 investigating alleged violations of human rights.
