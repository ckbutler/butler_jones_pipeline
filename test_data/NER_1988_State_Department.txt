 NIGER
 General Ali Saibou became President of Niger after the death
 of Seyni Kountche in November 1987. Ruling by decree, he is
 the head of an authoritarian military regime which has been in
 power since 1974. The nation's highest policymaking body is
 the Supreme Military Council, whose membership and meetings'
 are secret. In April the President announced that the
 "National Movement of the Development Society" will eventually
 be formed as the country's sole political party. -
 The Nigerien Armed Forces, numbering about 2,600 members plus
 800 gendarmes (paramilitary police), help ensure internal
 security. Other security organizations are: the Direction de
 la Securite de L'Etat (Directorate of State Security), which
 reports directly to the President; the Surete National (or
 National Police) which is responsible for maintaining public
 order and countering antigovernment activity; and a unit for
 presidential protection.
 Niger, one of the world's poorest countries, occupies a large
 area in the arid Sahel region of West Africa. The economy is
 based on subsistence farming, livestock raising, and some of
 the world's largest uranium deposits. However, cycles of
 drought, desertification, a 3.1 percent population growth
 rate, and declining world demand for uranium since the early
 1980's have had a serious negative impact on the Nigerien
 economy.
 Human rights are circumscribed. The freedoms of assembly,
 speech, press, and political activity continued to be tightly
 restricted in 1988. However, there have been some positive
 steps since Saibou assumed the Presidency in 1987. He has
 freed over 100 political detainees, made some improvements in
 prison administration, and formed a committee to draft a
 constitution. The Government also finally brought to trial in
 1988 a number of persons held since 1983 for an attempted coup
 d'etat (although the Government's handling of the cases
 pointed to the considerable extent of executive influence over
 the judiciary). In 1988 President Saibou also made clear the
 limits to change. He stressed that the military will continue
 to play a prominent role in the nation's political life and
 announced that, when it returns to constitutional law, Niger
 will not become a multiparty state.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There were no reports of political killings.
 b. Disappearance
 No politically motivated disappearances were reported.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 There are no reliable reports that systematic torture of
 detainees and prisoners takes place in Niger. Nevertheless,
 cruel treatment, usually in the form of beatings, is often
 meted out by officials charged with the custody of prisoners.

 NIGER
 Non-Nigerien Africans resident in Niger are frequently
 harassed by the police and occasionally suffer physical abuse
 while in detention. There were no instances in 1988 of
 officials being disciplined for such actions.
 In the past, political prisoners or detainees were rarely
 allowed family visits. Under President Saibou, political
 prisoners have gained more visitation rights. Prisoners with
 severe medical problems have normally received medical care.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 With the Constitution suspended since 1974, there are no
 specific statutory protections against arbitrary arrest or
 imprisonment. Warrants are not required for an arrest, and
 there is no right to judicial review of the legality of
 arrests or detentions. For criminal offenses, the law holds
 that detainees must be charged within 48 hours, but delays
 sometimes occur as the result of lack of trained lawyers and
 judges. In cases concerning political or security-related
 matters, detainees have been held for extended periods without
 charge, as in the case of the detainees held in connection
 with the October 1983 coup attempt against President Kountche
 (see Section l.e.).
 The number of political detainees at the end of 1988 was not
 known but was believed to be small. President Saibou released
 in 1987 over 100 political detainees and prisoners, some of
 whom had been held without charge or trial since 1974. Almost
 60 of that number were released from house arrest, including
 the former President, Hamani Diori, who had been detained in
 prison for 6 years and then placed under house arrest for
 almost 7 years.
 There are no known instances of dissidents or political
 opponents being exiled, although some dissidents have
 voluntarily gone into exile. In an effort at national
 reconciliation, President Saibou announced a general amnesty
 shortly after taking office, inviting those in exile to
 return. Among those who accepted is the current Minister of
 Public Enterprises, Mohammed Abdoulaye, who was in exile in
 Libya.
 With regard to forced or compulsory labor, see Section 6.c.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Niger's legal system is an amalgam of French, Islamic, and
 customary law. Civil and criminal cases not involving
 security-related acts are tried publicly. Legal counsel is
 provided by the State for indigent defendants accused of
 felonies or other major offenses if they are under 18 years of
 age, handicapped, or faced with the possibility of a sentence
 of more than 10 years. Defendants may appeal verdicts first
 to the Court of Appeals and, if desired, to the nation's
 highest tribunal, the State Court, composed of civilian
 magistrates, which serves as a final court of appeals. The
 President has the right of pardon in criminal cases and has
 invoked this right on several occasions in recent years. At
 the village level, matters such as property disputes are
 frequently resolved by traditional courts.
 In June 1985, the Government of President Kountche formed a
 special court to investigate civil service corruption. This
 court met regularly in 1988. Stiff penalties were established
 
 
 253
 NIGER
 for these crimes, including the death penalty for conviction
 of embezzlememt of over $500,000. Thus far, life imprisonment
 has been the most severe penalty assessed.
 Security-related cases are tried in the State Security Court
 which operates outside the normal legal framework. This body
 was established by presidential decree in 1974. It convenes
 in secret, and little is known about its proceedings. Most of
 its members are believed to be military officers.
 The number of political prisoners in Niger is small. While
 releasing most of the political detainees and prisoners in
 November 1987 on assuming power, the Government brought to
 trial in 1988 in the State Security Court 28 persons (4 in
 absentia) for their involvement in the 1983 coup attempt
 against President Kountche.   The Court sentenced the 4 in
 absentia to death and 3 others to prison terms, while
 acquitting 21. In a surprising move, the Government did not
 accept the verdict and brought the case to trial again. The
 retrial took place in September--the proceedings were in
 secret as in the first trial--and resulted in stiffer
 sentences: the 4 in absentia again received death sentences;
 16 received various prison terms: and 8 persons were
 acquitted. The Government insisted that the Court had acted
 independently, but it appeared that senior officials in the
 Government did not agree with the "lenient" sentences given in
 the first trial.
 Seven Tuaregs are serving 30-year sentences for their attack
 in 1985 on the police station in Tchin-Tabaraden.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The police have the right to enter homes between 5 a.m. and
 9 p.m. and will enter at other times if they deem it
 necessary. Court warrants are not required in such
 instances. Violations of privacy such as interference with
 correspondence, telephone tapping, and use of informer
 networks are known to take place.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 These freedoms are restricted, although the National Charter
 adopted in 1987 provides in principle for freedom of thought,
 expression, assembly, and association. Institutions such as
 an elected legislature do not exist.
 Niger's major print and electronic media are government owned
 and controlled. The Government uses the media to disseminate
 government policies and to rally popular support for official
 programs and the President and his advisers. While some
 criticism of government policy or bureaucratic inefficiency is
 allowed, especially in the weekly publication Sunday Sahel,
 such criticism is expressed either at the behest of, or at
 least with the knowledge and permission of, the Government.
 Debates on aspects of'the economy or cultural policy take
 place in the media, but the boundaries of permissible
 discussion are understood in advance by all participants.
 Niger's first independent journal, The Economic Operator,
 began regular circulation in late 1987. While not
 
 
 254
 NIGER
 controversial, it provides a vehicle for publishing material
 that does not represent solely governmental opinion.
 There have been no reports of censored or banned magazines or
 other publications, but the Government is under no legal
 constraints should it discover material that it deems
 offensive. Foreign films are subject to censorship by the
 Ministry of Interior on grounds of public morality and
 political content.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Most forms of voluntary association, such as trade unions,
 churches, and other religious groups, function with the
 understanding that they must act in accordance with government
 policy. Government permission is required for public
 gatherings and is granted only to recognized groups.
 1988 witnessed a major strike by university students that
 lasted almost a month. The students struck over several
 issues including: recognition of their association; universal
 full scholarships; the return to classes of their colleagues
 who had been sent to do their civilian service before
 graduation as a disciplinary measure after earlier student
 strikes; acceptance of all high school students into the
 university; better accommodations; and student representation
 on university boards and commissions. The Government resolved
 the strike peacefully through negotiation.
 For a discussion of freedom of association as it pertains to
 labor unions, see Section 6.a.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Niger is a secular state. While the population is over 90
 percent Muslim, the Government permits the practice of other
 religious beliefs. Foreign missionaires can live, work, and
 travel in Niger. Religious groups are allowed to maintain
 links with fellow believers'in other countries.
 The Government, cautious of the Islamic fundamentalist
 violence that erupts periodically in nearby northern Nigeria,
 monitors Muslim religious activity through the Islamic
 Association. This Association is funded by the Government and
 assists in an informal screening process of local religious
 leaders. Islamic services that go beyond strictly religious
 subjects are not permitted.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Travel within Niger is closely monitored, although there has
 been some relaxation during the last year. Police checks,
 often entailing thorough searches, take place upon entering or
 leaving major towns and cities. These checks reflect a
 governmental preoccupation with security and smuggling, a
 concern over possible movements into the country of
 foreign-based dissidents oL criminal elements, and a policy to
 discourage migration to urban areas. Nigeriens wishing to
 travel abroad must obtain exit visas, which are usually
 granted. Married women must have the permission of their
 husbands to travel abroad.
 The repatriation of Nigerien nationals is unrestricted. Niger
 is a party to the U.N. Convention and Protocol Relating to the
 
 
 255
 NIGER
 Status of Refugees and has cooperated with the U.N. High
 Commissioner for Refugees in handling the few registered
 refugees currently in Niger.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Citizens do not have the ability to change their government
 through democratic procedures. Political power is
 concentrated in the hands of the military, and President
 Saibou has placed more'government ministries in the hands of
 the military. Ten of his 29 cabinet positions are held by
 military officers. All of Niger's seven departments have
 military governors, who have sweeping powers within their
 departments.
 The President announced in 1988 that Niger will soon form its
 sole political party, The National Movement of the Development
 Society. The new party, when finally organized, will likely
 be an outgrowth of the National Development Council (NDC)
 system which has been in place since 1979. The NDC consists
 of a hierarchical network of smaller councils at the village,
 regional, departmental, and national levels. These councils
 consist of elected and appointed members, although only at the
 village level are members elected directly by the people. The
 national-level council consists of Nigeriens from all walks of
 life, who also serve on special committees to consider various
 aspects of economic development, cultural policy, and social
 issues.
 At the end of 1988, the committee to draft a new constitution
 had begun its deliberations. Women occupy many midlevel and
 lower level positions in the Nigerien Government. In 1987
 President Saibou appointed the first woman to a cabinet-level
 position and placed her in charge of women's affairs.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government has recently been very cooperative in answering
 inquiries on the status of political prisoners of interest to
 Amnesty International. There are no domestic groups which
 monitor the human rights situation in Niger. Niger is not
 active in regional and international human rights
 organizations.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Four major ethnic groups, each with its own language, make up
 the bulk of the population. The two primarily nomadic groups,
 Tuaregs and Fulani (peul), have less access to government
 services, partly because their transient lifestyles make it
 difficult for the Government to supply them with services.
 The essentially traditional nature of Nigerien society helps
 ensure that family and ethnic group ties remain strong and
 supportive, but traditional practices and attitudes on
 ethnicity, women, and education have some negative effects.
 Males have considerable advantages in terms of education,
 employment, and property rights. In cases of divorce, custody
 of all children under 8 years of age is given to the husband.
 
 
 256
 NIGER
 Conscious of the adverse situation of women, the Government
 has begun work on a new family code, tried to provide better
 employment opportunities to women, given them a significant
 role in the National Development Council, and supported a
 national women's association. Women are paid comparable wages
 to men and are active in the business community, although
 commerce is dominated by men. The first professional
 associations of women traders, educators, and bankers were
 formed in 1988. About one-third of Nigerien doctors are
 women, and many of the nation's magistrates are women. The
 Government continues to encourage family planning and in 1988
 legalized the use of contraceptives.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Approximately 90 percent of Niger's work force is employed in
 the rural sector. In the small modern economy, workers have
 the right to establish and join trade unions, but all unions
 by law must be organized under an umbrella group, the National
 Union of Nigerien Workers (USTN). The USTN is partially
 funded by the Government and is usually responsive to
 government policies. The head of the USTN is elected by its
 members. The USTN represents about 30 percent of the
 approximately 60,000 salaried workers in Niger. It publishes
 a quarterly magazine, The Worker, which discusses USTN
 activities. The USTN maintains relations with recognized
 international bodies, e.g., the International Labor
 Organization and the Accra-based Organization of African Trade
 Union Unity.
 Strikes in Niger are legal if conciliation and mediation
 procedures have been exhaasted. Uranium mine workers struck
 in 1987 over housing and other issues. Fellow workers from
 the nearby coal mine joined the strike, which ended with a
 negotiated settlement.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 Collective bargaining is legally authorized, but the
 Government is deeply involved in the process. There is a
 general collective bargaining agreement which has been in
 force since 1972 between the USTN, employers, and the
 Government. The agreement covers wages and benefits and is
 extensively applied to all sectors of the urban wage economy.
 Individual unions are permitted to bargain for more favorable
 agreements at their work sites. The Government promotes
 voluntary worker-employer negotiations but does not sit at the
 bargaining table in private sector negotiations. If these
 negotiations fail, the Government becomes the arbitrator. The
 collective bargaining agreement protects workers against
 antiunion discrimination. Labor legislation is applied
 uniformly throughout the country, and there are no export
 processing zones in Niger.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Niger's labor code prohibits forced or compulsory labor, and
 it is generally not practiced. The last reported instance of
 forced labor was during the 1985 drought emergency when
 displaced herders, primarily ethnic Tuaregs and Fulanis, were
 in some instances forcibly required to work in food-growing
 projects.
 
 
 257
 NIGER
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 Children between the ages of 12 and 18 may be employed, but
 there are strict provisions concerning the hours of employment
 and types of employment for children in this age group. All
 labor provisions, including those concerning child labor, are
 applied in practice only in urban areas. In the subsistence
 agricultural sector, which employs most Nigeriens, children
 work on family plots under conditions which are not in
 compliance with the-provisions of the labor code.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 The minimum wage for salaried workers is approximately $66
 per month. According to union officials, this wage is not
 sufficient to provide a decent living for workers and their
 families. USTN is negotiating with the Government, the
 largest employer of salaried workers, to increase the minimum
 wage rate. Because of the country's depressed economy, the
 Government has not increased salaries since 1980, despite the
 rising cost of living.
 The legal workweek is 40 hours. However, according to the
 labor code, certain occupations requiring irregular hours are
 authorized longer workweeks, with a maximum of 72 hours. The
 labor code also provides occupational safety and health
 regulations which are to be enforced by the labor inspector's
 office. Because of staff shortages, this office focuses
 mainly on the mining, building, and industrial sectors for
 safety violations. According to a ministry official,
 compliance is often difficult to enforce because of the
 attitude of the workers who are relatively uneducated and are
 therefore not fully cognizant of the safety risks posed in
 their jobs. They often complain and Lefuse to wear protective
 clothing because of Niger's hot climate. For the most part,
 employers have been responsive in providing safety equipment.
