 CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC
 General Andre Dieudonne Kolingba has headed the Government of
 the Central African Republic since his accession to power in a
 bloodless coup on September 1, 1981. He holds all political
 power and is the final arbiter on all governmental matters.
 He also headed the Military Committee for National Recovery
 until September 21, 1985, when that Committee was dissolved to
 make way for a civilian government composed of 18 Ministers, 4
 Secretaries of State, and 2 High Commissioners. This shift is
 viewed as one step in broadening the base of the Government.
 The Ministry of Interior is in charge of the Central African
 Republic's civilian police force. These police normally man
 barriers on the major roads and keep 'records on the movement
 of vehicles. The presidency has its own security force. The
 Ministry of Defense also has a military police force, in
 addition to the armed forces. Kolingba's Government faced
 sporadic challenges from dissidents in the north along the
 Chadian border throughout 1985. Although the dissidents were
 not a major threat, Central African and Chadian military
 forces held a joint military sweep through the area in April
 in an effort to root out opposition elements. A number of
 villages allegedly harboring oppositionists were burned, and a
 number of people were arrested and brought to the capital of
 Bangui.
 The Central African Republic is a poor, landlocked, sparsely
 populated country. Its inhabitants for the most part derive
 their livelihood from subsistence agriculture. Only about 1
 percent of the population is university educated. The
 essentially free enterprise agrarian economy, one of the
 world's least monetized, has suffered from inadequately
 coordinated and implemented government policies, occasional
 drought, and a poorly trained work force. Expatriates
 dominate the small manufacturing and commercial sectors of the
 economy. In 1985, the Government made progress towards
 reducing fraud and corruption in the public sector and towards
 stimulating the economy in the agricultural and industrial
 sectors.
 There was some improvement in the human rights situation in
 the Central African Republic in 1985. The Government on
 December 31, 1984, released 85 political prisoners who had
 never been brought to trial and reduced the sentences of some
 others. As the year 1985 progressed, however, some civilian
 casualties were reported in the northern fighting, and
 sporadic arrests of people for political reasons continued.
 Some of those arrested were held until proven innocent and
 then released; others were found guilty and sentenced; others
 are still held without being charged. On December 1, 1985,
 President Kolingba pardoned 89 political prisoners. An
 additional 120 persons convicted of or charged with
 nonpolitical offenses were also released.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1     Respect for the Integrity of the Person,Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There is no evidence of killings or summary executions for
 political motives by government forces. However, there may
 have been some civilian casualties in the military action
 against guerrillas in April.

 CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC
 b. Disappearance
 There is no evidence that people have been abducted, secretly
 arrested, or clandestinely detained, or that they disappeared
 as a result of government action.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 The Penal Code prohibits torture and provides for sanctions
 against persons guilty of physical abuse. Nevertheless, there
 are reports of beatings in prisons. In addition, there have
 been reports of torture by military officers of alleged
 dissidents or sympathizers in the northern area around Paoua.
 Conditions in the prisons are generally poor, and medical
 attention is inadequate. However, prominent political
 detainees have reportedly been well-treated and given special
 privileges, such as extra family visits.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Kolingba's Government has on occasion engaged in arbitrary
 arrest and imprisonment. Generally such arrests occur when
 allegations are made that a suspect has engaged in acts which
 present a threat to the regime. It is likely that some
 political detainees are currently being held, but it is
 difficult to say precisely how many are being held at any one
 time since they are not all kept at the main prison but may be
 kept in the gendarmerie or in other detention places around
 Bangui. Often they are held for a few days or a few months
 and released if no evidence is found against them. Family
 members, legal counsel, doctors, and ministers of the faith
 have, as'a rule, been allowed access to prisoners. It is not
 uncommon for those held outside the main prison to be allowed
 to return home during the day or to sleep at night. Under
 local law, political detainees can be held without charge for
 as long as 2 months, but at that point detainees must either
 be formally charged or released. If they are charged, local
 judicial procedures (which are modeled on French procedures)
 allow for open-ended preventive detention while the public
 prosecutor prepares the state's case against the accused.
 Some political detainees are held much longer than 2 months,
 however, without formal charges being brought against them.
 In the case of common criminals, the law requires that within
 96 hours they be brought before a magistrate who decides
 whether formal charges will be filed.
 About six well-known political opponents live in exile.
 Several have been sentenced to death in absentia for crimes
 against the state. However, during December 1, 1985, National
 Day celebrations, President Kolingba indicated a possible
 willingness to move toward reconciliation with opposition
 elements.
 The Government has been cited in the International Labor
 Organization (ILO) for being in violation of ILO conventions
 29 and 105, for allegedly imposing compulsory labor on
 prisoners jailed for unauthorized political activities.
 e. Denial of a Fair Public Trial
 In most common criminal cases, the Government permits
 French-modeled legal procedures to be fairly and openly
 applied and the laws to be properly executed. The new
 
 
 62
 CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC
 constitutional decree of September 21, 1985, which is
 apparently prefatory to the planned future constitution,
 states that the judiciary "is guaranteed independence (from)
 the legislative and executive (power)." The President of the
 Republic is the guarantor of that independence in his role of
 "President of the Supreme Magistrative Council."
 The number of political prisoners is unknown. The case of
 High Commissioner Francois Gueret, Secretary General of the
 banned political party, Movement for Democracy and
 Independence, has been well-publicized and is not atypical.
 In February 1985, he was arrested and charged with destroying
 administrative documents and inciting public disorder. When
 the State's procurer cited lack of evidence to support those
 charges, Gueret was charged with refusing to wear the military
 uniform required of high commissioners. A judicial inquiry
 recommended his release at the end of April. Nevertheless, he
 continued to be detained and was finally charged with trying
 to overthrow the Government. A public trial, under a special
 tribunal, was held, and he was convicted and sentenced to 10
 years in prison.
 A special tribunal comprising civilian magistrates and
 military advisers adjudicates political crimes. The special
 tribunal differs from ordinary courts in that there is no
 appeal process except for the possibility of presidential
 clemency, and in that it can try a case only after being
 specifically authorized by the President. Political detainees
 have a right to legal counsel from the start of formal
 procedures. President Kolingba has authorized the meeting of
 the special tribunal on a fairly frequent basis. Trials are
 open to the public and are often reported in the local media.
 Section 2     Respect for Civil Rights, including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The right to speak publicly about political developments or to
 criticize the Government is circumscribed although most people
 feel free to comment privately on the situation. The
 Government prohibits the distribution of tracts and literature
 deemed to be subversive. There are no regularly published
 newspapers, but those that do appear sporadically are
 carefully monitored. Both the radio and television are
 controlled by the Government.
 In July 1985, the local television broadcast a roundtable on
 human rights to a wide audience. Roundtable participants
 included government officials and private individuals involved
 in legal matters, as well as the U.S. Ambassador.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Only assemblies of a nonpolitical nature can take place
 without fear of government repression.
 In 1981, Kolingba suspended the General Union of Central
 African Workers, and no effective labor movement has existed
 in the country since that time. The Government tacitly
 approves of an apoliticized labor federation that exists
 mostly on paper and has no collective bargaining authority.
 The ILO has a case pending before it involving the Central
 African Republic's alleged violations of the right to freedom
 of association under ILO Convention 87. The Government has
 
 
 CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC
 yet to provide the substantive information requested by the
 ILO committee reviewing the case. In principle, the right to
 strike exists, although fear of government reprisals has
 dampened the enthusiasm of potential strikers.
 During 1985, there was a very brief student strike at the
 university to protest the detention of two student association
 leaders who had been suspended for disrupting the activities
 of the association. They were not detained for long, and the
 strike ended quickly. Also in 1985 there were, for the first
 time, several demonstrations in Bangui by university graduates
 and sympathizers who have not found employment due to the
 current freeze on hiring in the civil service and the paucity
 of jobs in the private sector. The demonstrations were
 peaceful, and the Government refrained from taking any
 repressive measures.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 The Government does not generally interfere with religious
 activities. Religious organizations and missionary groups are
 provided religious freedom by Central African custom. No
 single religion predominates, nor does the Government appear
 to discriminate in favor of or against specific religions.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 People are generally free to move about within the country,
 although there are road checkpoints. The right of voluntary
 travel and repatriation is recognized. Financial and
 educational constraints-rather than government controls
 restrict most foreign travel and emigration. No case of
 revocation of citizenship was reported in 1985.
 The country remains relatively hospitable to foreigners; the
 largest foreign population living either temporarily or
 permanently in the country is from Chad, with the vast
 majority relying on U.N. relief. During 1985, the number of
 Chadian refugees--mostly women, children, and the aged--
 increased to some 40,000 along the northern border. The
 Government is working with the United Nations High Commission
 for Refugees (UNHCR) to move them to four settlements away
 from the border. Recent reports indicate that many of the
 refugees are now returning to Chad.
 Section 3     Respect for Political Rights: The Right of
 Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 On September 21, 1985, President Kolingba dissolved the
 National Committee for Recovery and appointed a civilian
 cabinet, an event which continued the process begun in 1984 of
 moving from a military government towards institutionalization
 of a civilian government. Kolingba took a further step
 towards civilian rule in December when he announced that he
 will name a constitutional commission in early 1986 which
 would be tasked with writing a new constitution or
 appropriately amending the constitution that was suspended in
 1981. Currently, President Kolingba retains all political
 power, presiding over the executive branch and establishing
 legislation through the Council of Ministers and by
 presidential decree. Although in practice he allows his
 cabinet considerable leeway in the day-to-day activities of
 
 
 64
 CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC
 government administration, he makes all important policy
 decisions and is the final arbiter of all government matters.
 Since September 1, 1981, all forms of public and private
 assembly for political purposes have been proscribed and
 Kolingba has stated that he has "no intention of returning his
 country to the turbulent multiparty experience of the pre-1981
 regime."
 Preference for high government positions has generally been
 given to members of President Kolingba's Yakoma tribe.
 However, the preeminence of this group has been lessened by
 Kolingba's recent cabinet reshuffle. There are no women
 ministers, secretaries of state, or high commissioners in the
 Kolingba Government.
 Section 4     Governmental Attitude Regarding International
 and Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged
 Violations of Human Rights
 The Government does not welcome and is sensitive to
 international or nongovernmental investigation of alleged
 human rights abuses but does not prohibit such
 investigations. Representatives of Amnesty International and
 the International Committee of the Red Cross visit Bangui
 periodically. Amnesty International, in its 1985 report
 (covering 1984), was concerned about the imprisonment of
 prisoners of conscience (most of whom were released at the end
 of 1984); about the detention without trial of other political
 prisoners, including some refugees; and about certain aspects
 of trials before the special tribunal. Freedom House rates
 the Central African Republic "not free."
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 The Central African Republic is one of the world's least
 developed nations. In 1985, per capita gross national product
 was $310, and the population of 2.8 million was growing at the
 rate of 3 percent a year.
 The economy has suffered in the past 15 years from poor
 policies, inept management, and corruption, but agricultural
 production during 1985 was good with cotton and coffee
 production up substantially. Current government plans focus
 on strengthening the agricultural sector--and on discouraging
 urban migration by providing rural development--primarily
 through road building/maintenance programs and encouraging
 cash and food crop production. During 1985, in accordance
 with an International Monetary Fund standby agreement, the
 Government continued to implement austere budget measures and
 increase government revenues including efforts to reduce the
 bloated civil service and improve tax collection.
 The infant mortality rate is 134 per 1,000 live births, and
 life expectancy at birth is only 48.8 years, due to inadequate
 or simply nonexistent health care in most of the country.
 Although health care is accorded a high priority by the
 Government, lack of trained personnel and the inaccessibility
 of large parts of the country impede its delivery to much of
 the population. In 1978, 40 percent of the urban population
 and 5 percent of the rural population had access to safe
 water. In 1977, caloric supply as a percent of the daily
 requirement was 95 for the average Central African.
 
 
 65
 CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC
 Almost all education in the country is government supported.
 Total school population is about 310,000 (primary through
 university levels). In 1980, about 33 percent of the adult
 population was literate (49 percent of the men and 19 percent
 of the women); undoubtedly this rate is far lower in rural
 areas. The Government is making a concerted effort to train
 more teachers and to build more schools for those living
 outside the capital. In 1981, primary school enrollment was
 89 percent for males and 50 percent for females of primary
 school age.
 With respect to employment and working conditions, the law
 forbids employment of children under 14 years of age. While
 it is only loosely enforced, jobs are in such demand that
 children in the labor force are generally limited to working
 as helpers in family business such as selling food products or
 cigarettes. Minimum wages have been established by the
 Government, and a social security system exists. However,
 much labor is performed outside the wage and social security
 system and probably does not meet the minimum levels set. The
 law sets maximum working hours for government employees and
 most people in the private sector at 40 hours per week.
 Domestic employees may work up to 56 hours. There are also
 general laws on health and safety standards in the workplace,
 but they are neither precisely defined nor actively enforced.
 Women are generally accorded a lower status than men in the
 Central African Republic. Their work at home and in the
 fields prevents many of them from receiving any formal
 education. Polygamy is common, but the legal system and
 traditional practice support the rights of wives and all
 children of such marriages. A national women's organization
 exists which is supported by the Government.
 There are more than 80 ethnic groups living in the Central
 African Republic. There is no institutionalized
 discrimination.
