 YEMEN
 The Republic of Yemen was preclaimed in 1990 following the unification of the
 former Yemen Arab Republic (YAR), or North Yemen, and the People's Democratic
 Republic of Yemen (PDRY), or South Yemen. After a relatively calm transition pe-
 riod of several years, a "unity" crisis ensued, and in May a civil war broke out dur-
 ig which the southern part seceded. By early July, unionist military forces pre-
 vailed against southern-based secessionists. After the fighting, most of the seces-
 sionist leadership fled abroad. Since then, the main party of the south, the Yemeni
 Socialist Party (YSP), elected a new leadership and is now an opposition party. The
 governing coalition is composed of the General People's Congress (GPC) and the Is-
 lamic Yemeni Grouping for Reform (Islaah).
 The Government adopted a new Constitution in September, replacing the 1991
 Constitution. The President is Ali Abdullah Saleh, the former President of the
 Yemen Arab Republic and leader of the GPC. He was elected to a 5-year term in
 1994 by the legislature, but the Constitution provides that henceforth the President
 will be elected in a popular vote from candidates selected by the legislature. The
 301-seat House of Representatives was elected in 1993-the first multiparty Par-
 liament elected by popular vote and universal suffrage. Tribal leaders control many
 parts of the country where central authority is weak.
 The primary state security apparatus is the Political Security Organization (PSO)
 which reports directly to the President. It is independent of the Ministry of Interior.
 PSO officers have broad discretion over perceived national security issues and, de-
 spite constitutional constraints, routinely detain citizens for questioning, frequently
 mistreat them, monitor their activities, and search their homes. The Criminal Inves-
 tigative Department (CMD) of the police conducts most arrests. The Central Security
 Organization (CSO), a part of theMinistry of the Interior, maintains a paramilitary
 force.
 Yemen is a poor country in which oil and agriculture dominate the economy. Oil
 is the primary source of foreign exchange, but remittances from some 500,000 Yem-
 enis working in Saudi Arabia are also important. The level of remittances was
 sharply reduced after Saudi Arabia and other Gulf states expelled up to 850 000
 Yemeni workers during the Gulf War because of the Governments support for 1raq.
 Most of the Gulf states have also suspended foreign assistance programs, and much
 Western aid has been reduced.
 While the Government remains in principle committed to democratic reform, some
 serious human rights abuses took place -before, during, and after the civil war.
 Major problems include arbitrary arrest and detention, especially of those regarded
 as separatists'; torture; infringements on the freedom of the press; and widespread
 discrimination based on sex, race, and religion.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial R'ling.-Before and during the civil war,
 there were widespread reports that government and southern Yemeni forces, includ-
 ing members of the YSP, committed extrajudicial killings of both civilians and mili-
 tary personnel. None of the allegations has been substantiated.
 b. Di.appearance.-As in previous years, many citizens reportedly disappeared fol-
 lowing their arrests by the security forces or regular army units. Most disappear-
 ances were temporary and were members of the YSP. Central government forces re-
 leased the vast majority of these persons after varying periods of detention.
 Hundreds of cases of disappearances dating from the 1970's, implicating the gov-
 ernments of both North and South Yemen, remain unresolved. Included among
 
 
 1194
 these cases are some 200 to 300 South Yemenis who disappeared in the former
 PDRY during an internal conflict in 1986. The Government has never established
 a mechanism to resolve such cases.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution is ambiguous on its prohibition of cruel or inhuman punishments.
 It states that the Government may not impose "illegal" punishments-a formulation
 that may be interpreted as permitting amputations according to Islamic law, or
 Shar'ia. Another article asserts that Shar'ia is 'the source of all legislation.7
 There is no indication that the Government has carried out amputations. How-
 ever, there have been undocumented reports that prison and other officials have car-
 ried out such acts extrajudicially.
 The Government tightly controls access to detention facilities. Nonetheless, it per-
 mits most impartial observers to visit prisoners and detainees with some exceptions.
 Although there is no evidence that the authorities torture detainees arrested for
 common felonies, on occasion they may resort to force, or the threat of force, to ex-
 tract information. The press continues to report stories of alleged torture and mis-
 treatment of detainees and prisoners.
 The use of torture by central government forces is believed to exist but is uncom-
 mon. There were undocumented reports that both sides tortured military personnel
 captured during the civil war. One international human rights roup reported that
 soldiers tied up some prisoners and hung them from a rod with bound hands and
 feet.
 However, there were credible reports that central government forces inhumanely
 treated northern military officers suspected of secessionist sympathies. Therewere
 also reports that the authorities inhumanely treated prisoners held in "secret" mili-
 tar    prisons (see Section 1.d.).
 Prison conditions do not meet internationally recognized minimum standards.
 Prisons are overcrowded, sanitary conditions are poor, and rations and health care
 inadequate. Inmates depend on relatives to provide food and medicines. The authori-
 ties still use leg irons and shackles, and the law permits flogging. Many cases of
 reported flogging occurred 1 1992 and 1993; the practice likely continued in 1994.
 Shortly afthe w, when Aden, the former capital of the PDRY, was occupied
 by troops and "Islamic extremists," persons were often flogged in public, without
 trial, for offenses such as drinking alcohol or walking with a member of the opposite
 sex. These floggings were evidently carried out as extrajudicial punishments for
 those deemed to have transgressed Islamic law. The practice was discontinued after
 the Government restored law and order.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Despite constitutional and other legal
 provisions, there continue to be reports of arbitrary arrest and prolonged detention
 without charge. According to the Constitution, detainees must be araigned within
 24 hours of arrest or released. The judge or district attorney must inform the ac-
 cused of the basis for the arrest and decide whether or not to hold the accused. In
 no case may a detainee be held longer than 7 days without a court order.
 Detainees have the right to inform their families of their arrests and may decline
 to answer questions during interrogation without an attorney present. In practice,
 many authorities respect these rights only if bribed. There is a system of bail.
 Some detainees are reportedlyheld in an undetermined number of unauthorized
 or secret locations. Attorneys and other judicial authorities have complained of the
 continued existence of extrajudicial prisons maintained by certain ministries, nota-
 bly the Ministry of Interior. The Government has failed to ensure that detainees
 and prisoners are incarcerated in authorized detention facilities. Army bases are not
 believed to be used as detention facilities for civilian prisoners. Moreover, some un-
 authorized prisons are believed to exist in "tribal" areas.
 Approximately 100 to 200 northern military officers suspected of having separatist
 sympathies during the civil war are believed to be held under inhumane conditions
 in secret military prisons. However, the existence of such prisons has not been con-
 firmed.
 In certain cases where a suspect is at large, the security forces may detain one
 of the suspect's relatives while the suspect is sought and the families of the suspect
 and victim negotiate compensation for the alleged wrongdoing.
 As many as 4,000 inmates, most of whom are accused or convicted felons, are im-
 prisned without documentation concerning their sentences or reasons for their ar-
 rest. Most were moved to central prisons from outlying jails following unification in
 1990. Written records for southern prisoners were in most cases lost or destroyed
 in the civil war or the subsequent looting. The authorities in the north reportedly
 never kept records. Many inmates who are released during the customary annual
 amnesty are believed to be among those without any written record of their arrest
 or sentence.
 
 
 1195
 At the end of the civil war, the President pardoned all persons who fought against
 the central Government. The amnesty extended to all militay personnel and most
 of the leaders of the unrecognized, secessionist Democratic Republic of Yemen
 (DRY), except for the DRY's 16 most senior leaders who fled abroad. Although they
 were technically not forced into exile, they would presumably be subject to arrest
 if they returned. President Saleh stated that the cases of some of the 16 would be
 reconsidered if they renounce their separatist ambitions. Many thousands of Yem-
 enis returned from abroad to take advantage of the amnesty.
 e. Denial of a Fair Tria.-From 1990 until the outbreak of the civil war, the
 courts in northern and southern Yemen functioned as before unification: they ap-
 plied two distinct bodies of law but shared a common Supreme Court. After the civil
 war, the Government merged the two judiciaries.
 There are two types of courts: Islamic law or Sharria courts, which try criminal
 cases and adudicate issues of personal status, such as divorce and inheritance; and
 the commercial courts. There are no jury trials in the Shaia system. Cases are ad-
 judicated by a judge who plays an active role in questioning witnesses, but defense
 attorneys are allowed to advise their clients, addrss the court and examine wit-
 nesses. Defendants have the right to appeal their sentences. Trials are public.
 In commercial courts, defendants also enjoy the rigt of appeal, and court sessions
 are generally open to the public. However, both in Shars and the commercial
 courts may conduct closed sessions "for reasons of public security or morals." For-
 eign litigants in commercial disputes have complained of biased rulings.
 The judiciary is not fully independent. Many litigants maintain that a judge's trib-
 al ties, and even bribery, sometimes have greater influence on the verdict than the
 the law or facts. Others maintain that judges closely associated with the Govern-
 ment often render decisions favorable to it.
 The President denies that the Government detains political prisoners. However,
 an estimated 100 to 200 military officers, allegedly sympathetic to the breakaway
 DRY, are reportedly detained in secret military prisons (see Section .d.).
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-Despite
 constitutional provisions against such interference, security forces routinely search
 homes, monitor telephones, read personal mail, and otherwise intrude into personal
 matters for alleged security considerations. Such activities are conducted without
 warrants issued-by legal authorities or other judicial supervision. Many citizens be-
 lieve that the security forces monitor telephone conversations.
 g. Use of Excessive Force and Violations of Humanitarian Law in Internal Con-
 flicts.-Combatants on both sides in the civil war conducted a number of abuses
 against unarmed civilians. Such practices included the use of Scud missiles against
 targets in populated areas; armed conflict conducted near refugees; and the shelling
 of urban areas, particularly Aden. In some instances, military forces appeared to
 seek refuge in densely populated areas, threatening civilians often caught in the
 crossfire, although most tank battles took place in rural areas. Vast numbers of
 mines, which threaten the lives of civilians in the south, were left behind and ham-
 per efforts to restore water and electricity to Aden.
 In one instance in May, government army units surrounded the YSP headquarters
 building in Sanaa. According to eyewitnesses, tanks were used to overpower a small
 contingent of YSP guards, who fought back determinedly. The army reportedly may
 not have given the guards a sufficient opportunity to surrender before opening fire.
 Although there were no known fatalities, the destruction of the property exceeded
 necessity. The Government has not undertaken any investigation of the incident.
 Human rights groups and others noted extensive looting, vandalism, and destruc-
 tion not caused during the prosecution of the war. While military forces may not
 have been directly implicated in much of the vandalism, some observers maintain
 that they may have been able to prevent it. They also claim that the looting and
 vandalism may have exceeded war-related damage in some urban areas of the
 south.
 After the war, the Central Government restored order in the south, and the inci-
 dence of political violence aimed at the YSP decreased.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution restricts the freedoms of
 speech and press "within the limits of the law.* Although many citizens are uninhib-
 ited in their discussions of domestic and foreign policies, some are cautious, believ-
 i   that they may be harassed for publicly expressed criticisms of the Government.
 .FLm 1990 until the the outbreak of the civil war, the press operated freely. Dur-
 ing that period, nearly 100 newspapers appeared, reflecting a broad srum  of po-
 litical views. The Government licenses all newspapers, but not journalists. However,
 after war broke out, it shut down all papers associated with the YSP, as well as
 
 
 1196
 those which expressed separatist sympathies. After the war, the Government began
 to ease some, but not all, restraints on the press.
 To avoid possible government harassment, journalists censor themselves, espe-
 cially when writing about the civil war, relations with Saudi Arabia, and corruption
 of senior officials. The penalty for exceeding such self-imposed limits would likely
 be arrest for slander or ibel.
 The Ministry of Information influences the media by its ownership of the printing
 presses, subsidies to certain newspapers, and ownership of the radio and television
 companies. The Government censors radio and television news broadcasts which
 never contain reports critical of it. However, the two television channels regularly
 broadcast parliamentary debates in which Members of Parliament sometimes voice
 criticisms.
 Customs officials are authorized to confiscate any imported material regarded as
 pornographic or objectionable because of religious or political content. Before the
 civil war, the Government occasionally prohibited foreign publications critical of the
 Government. After the war, the Government banned for various lengths of time the
 importation of newspapers owned by Saudi investors--notably Sharq Al-Awsat (The
 Middle East) and A1-Hayat (Life). Publications critical of the Government were al-
 lowed again, but certain Saudi-backed papers did not appear until much later.
 A court case was recently decided in favor of the newspaper, Al Shoura, which
 the Government charged with slander against the President, sowing seeds of sec-
 tarianism, and editorial impropriety. The trial was public and received wide cov-
 erage. The judge dismissedall charges and ordered the Government to pay the
 newspaper's legal fees and costs.
 In early January 1995, the Government reportedly suspended publication of the
 Aden-based newspaper, Al-Ayyani, for publishing articles critical of government pol-
 icy in the south. The writer, Abu Bakr AI-Saqqaf, a noted dissident, was reportedly
 kidnaped and beaten by suspected government agents.
 University professors and administrators require security clearances before they
 are hired. Security officials are present on the Sanaa University campus and inform-
 ers monitor the activities of students and professors.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.--Citizens have a right to dem-
 onstrate peacefully and they exercise it. However, during the civil war, the Govern-
 ment strictly curtailed this right. Associations must obtain a license from the Min-
 istry of Labor and Social Affairs, but licensing is usually routine.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-Islam is the state religion and there are restrictions on
 the practice of other religions. Virtually all citizens are Muslims, either of the Zaydi
 branch of Shi'a Islam or the Shafe'ei branch of Sunni Islam. There are also some
 Ismailis in the north. Private Islamic organizations may maintain ties to pan-Is-
 lamic organizations and operate schools, but the Government closely monitors their
 activities.
 Most of the once sizable Jewish population has emigrated; fewer than 500 remain.
 Jewish religious services are held in private homes. In recent years, the Govern-
 ment removed unwritten obstacles which had prevented Jews from obtaining pass-
 ports and hindered their contact with foreign Jewish groups.
 Most Christians are foreign residents, except for a few Christian families of In-
 dian origin in Aden. There are several churches and Hindu temples in Aden, but
 no non-Muslim places of worship in the former North Yemen. After the civil war,
 suspected Islamic extremists looted and vandalized the Anglican Church in Aden,
 desecrated others, looted Hindu temples, and even desecrated some Islamic shrines
 regarded by the extremists as sacrilegious. Damage to the Anglican church was esti-
 mated at $70,000 to $80,000. Government forces have since reestablished security
 around these places of worship.
 The Christian clergy minister to the foreign community and are employed in
 teaching, social services, and health care. The Government does not allow them to
 proselytize Muslims. By religious convention, Muslims may not convert to other reli-
 gions. A religiously motivated suit was brought against a hospital in Jibla operated
 y the Baptist Church, charging it with defamation of Islam and proselytization. Al-
 though the court dismissed the case because the plaintiffs could not substantiate
 their charges and for procedural reasons Islaah Party members the continue to har-
 ass the Yemeni employees of the hospitai.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Government does not obstruct the freedom of travel, although the
 army and security forces maintain checkpoints on major roads. The Government
 does not obstruct travel abroad or the right to emigrate and return. In recent years
 it has removed bureaucratic obstacles that prevented most Jews from traveling
 abroad.
 
 
 1197
 Women must often obtain permission from a male relative before applying for a
 passport. The Constitution prohibits the extradition of a citizen to any country.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rightm The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 International observers judged as generally as free and fair the 1993 parliamen-
 tary election. Although the Government is accountable to the Parliament, there are
 significant limitations on the ability of the people to affect change within their soci-
 ety. To date the Parliament is not an effective counterweight to executive authority,
 it has done little more than debate issues. Decisionmaking is not transparent, and
 real political power still rests in the hands of relatively few leaders, particularly the
 President.
 The President has the authority to introduce legislation and promulgate laws by
 decree when Parliament is not in session. Decrees must be approved by Parliament
 within 30 days after reconvening. In theory, if the decree is not approved, it does
 not become law; in practice, very little happens if the decree is not approved. The
 President appoints the Prime Minister who forms the Government. The Cabinet is
 comprised of 27 ministers, with 16 ministers from the GPC, 9 from Islaah, and 2
 independents.
 In northern and southern governorates, tribal leaders retain considerable discre-
 tion in the interpretation and enforcement of the law. Central government authority
 in these areas is often weak. Some observers maintain that tribalism may promote
 accountable government in some ways by dramatically drawing the Government's
 attention to the grievances of the people.
 There is a functioning multiparty system. All parties must register with the Gov-
 ernment, but such registration is routinely granted. The Constitution prohibits the
 establishment of parties that are contrary to Islam or oppose the goals of the Yem-
 eni revolution or violate Yemeni international commitments. By law the Govern-
 ment must give financial support to all recognized parties, and parties are permitted
 to establish their own newspapers. Many of the approximately 50 political parties
 are very small and exist on paper only. The three largest are the GPC, the Islaah
 Party, and the YSP. The opposition is weak and divided among miniparties, except
 for the YSP which, even in its weakened state, still has weight, especially in the
 South.
 Although women may vote and hold office, these rights are limited by cultural and
 religious custom. Only 2 women have been elected to the 301-member Parliament,
 an d few hold senior leadership positions in the Government or political parties.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The Yemeni Human Rights Organization is the only local nongovernmental
 human rights group. It is headquartered in Sanaa with branches in seven other
 cities. The Government does not overtly restrict its activities. Another group, the
 Yemeni Organization for the Defense of Liberties and Human Rights, was based in
 Aden. After the civil war, the Government dissolved it because it was purportedly
 regarded as a "separatist" organization.
 There is a human rights committee in Parliament, which has done little of sipni..-
 cance aside from holding meetings and hosting an international childrens rights
 conference in 1993.
 Amnesty International and Middle East Watch observe Yemen closely, especially
 in the wake of the civil war. There is an International Committee of the Reai Cross
 representative resident in Yemen. The Government has given these groups rel-
 atively broad access to government officials, records, refugee camps, and prisons.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 Prior to 1994 the Constitution stated that 'no discrimination shall be practiced
 due to sex, color, racial origin, language, occupation, social status, or religious be-
 liefs." However, as amended in 1994, the Constitution now states that "** * all
 citizens are equal in general rights and duties * * *" The change has been inter-
 preted as an attempt to weaken previous constitutional guarantees of equality, espe-
 cially for women.
 Women.-Women face significant restrictions imposed by law and social custom.
 Men are permitted to take as many as four wives, provided they treat their wives
 equally. Husbands may divorce wives without justifying their actions before a court
 and, in the case of divorce, beth the family home an children are often awarded
 to the husband. Women also have the right to divorce their husbands in accordance
 with precepts of Sharia. Islamic law permits a Muslim man to marry a Christian
 or Jevish woman, but no Muslim woman may marry outside of Islam. Social pres-
 
 
 1198
 sure often forces women to defer to the guidance of male relatives if they wish to
 travel abroad.
 Married women do not have the right to confer citizenship on their foreign-born
 spouses; but they may confer citizenship on children born in Yemen of foreign-born
 fathers.
 The practice of dowry payments is widespread, despite government efforts to limit
 the size of such payments. An estimated 80 percent of women are illiterate, com-
 pared to 40 to 50 percent of men. In general, women in Aden are better educated
 and have somewhat greater employment opportunities than women in northern
 Yemen. Before the civil war, women in Aden worked in private business and at mid-
 level government jobs. Several women worked as lawyers and judges. After the civil
 war, the number of working women in Aden appears to have declined. Many observ-
 ers say this is due to the increasing "Islamization" of Adeni society, although there
 is no concrete evidence of this.
 Although spousal abuse is known to occur, reliable statistics on its extent are un-
 available, and there is little public discussion of this matter. In theory, abused
 women have the right to sue their husbands, but few do so. According to social tra-
 dition, battered women are pressured to keep spousal violence problems within the
 family. They may seek help and mediation from male relatives to halt abuse.
 The Government has established a women's association to promote female edu-
 cation and civic responsibilities, and a nongovernmental organization has also been
 established for the same purpose.
 Children.-The Government's commitment to protecting childrens' rights was ad-
 versely affected by the political crisis and the civil war. Moreover, the Government
 lacks the resources necessary to ensure adequate health, education, and welfare
 services for children.
 Child marriage is still common in rural areas. Female genital mutilation is prac-
 ticed by Yemems of African origin in the coastal areas along the Red and Arabian
 seas. There is no available information on the extent of the practice. While some
 government health workers discourage female genital mutilation, the Government
 has not passed any legislation or nor made any other effort to eradicate the practice.
 National IRacial IEthnic Minorities.-Yemenis with a non-Yemeni parent called
 "Muwalladin", may face discrimination in employment and in other areas. Persons
 seeking employment at Sanaa University or admission to the military academy
 must by law demonstrate they have two Yemeni parents. Nonethless many senior
 government officials, including members of Parliament and ministers, have only one
 Yemeni parent. In some cases, naturalization of the non-Yemeni parent is sufficient
 to overcome the "two-Yemeni-parent" requirement.
 A small group believed to be descendants of ancient Ethiopian occupiers of
 Yemen, who were later enslaved, are considered the lowest social class. Known as
 the "Akhdam" (servants), they live in squalor and endure persistent social discrimi-
 nation.
 Religious Minorities.-Apart from a small but undetermined number of Christians
 and Hindus in Aden and a small number of Baha'is in the north, Jews are the only
 indigenous religious minority. Jews are traditionally restricted to living in one sec-
 tion of a city or village andare often confined to a limited choice of employment,
 usually farming or handicrafts. Jews may, and do, own real property.
 People With Disabilities.-The Government has not enacted legislation or other-
 wise mandated accessibility for the disabled, nor provided special clinics or schools
 for them. Mentally ill patients, particularly those who commit crimes, are occasion-
 ally imprisoned and shackled when there is no one else to care for them. There are
 distinct social prejudices against persons with mental and physical handicaps. The
 disabled often face discrimination in education and employment.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Workers have the right of association as stipulated
 by law. Before the outbreak of the civil war, labor unions in the north and south
 were closely controlled by the respective ruling parties. With the end of the war,
 the Labor Code of the former North Yemen has become the law in fact. The Govern-
 ment has not yet enacted a formal labor code.
 Under the law, a union may be set up by 100 or more workers upon application
 to and approval by the Government. If a union does not apply for or is not given
 governmental approval, it is illegal. The Code prescribes a single union system with
 one union committee, or union local, for each enterprise; one general union for an
 economic sector, and one national umbrella organization, Yemeni Confederation of
 Labor Unions (YCLU), which was established in 1990 at the time of the unification.
 The YCLU is affiliated with the International Confederation of Arab Trade Unions
 and the formerly Soviet-controlled World Federation of Trade Unions. Experts sug-
 
 
 1199
 gest that the Government likely would not tolerate the establishment of an alter-
 native labor federation unless it believed it to be in its best interests.
 By law civil servants and public sector workers, and some categories of farm
 workers may not join unions. The President is authorized to dissolve a union by
 decree. Unions may not legally engage in political activity and must allow the Gov-
 ernment to insp    their records.
 The law neither prohibits nor provides for the right to strike, nor does it prohibit
 retribution against strikers. There were no known major strikes in 1994.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Existing law does not protect
 the right to bargain collectively. The Government must approve any collective agree-
 ment. However, there are no known comprehensive collective bargaining agreements
 at present. Unions may negotiate wage settlements for their members and have
 often resorted to strikes or other actions to achieve their demands.
 The Labor Code does not prohibit antiunion discrimination. Therefore, employers
 are not required to reinstate workers fired for union activities. If employers enage
 in anti-union activity, the legal recourse for the union to fight such activity isim-
 ited. Nevertheless, there is a system of labor courts, which are often favorably dis-
 posed toward unions--especially if the employer is a foreign company.
 In 1993 the International Labor Organization's Committee of Experts urged the
 Government to adopt legislation protecting workers against antiunion discrimna-
 tion. The Government has not yet taken such a step.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Constitution prohibits forced
 or compulsory labor. There are no reports that it occurs.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.--Child labor is common, especially
 in rural areas. Even in urban areas, children may be observed working in work-
 shops, stores, and beg     in the streets. There is no minimum age for the employ-
 ment of children, butthe exting Code permits apprenticeships for children who are
 14 years old. The Government is not able to enforce this regulation, however, espe-
 cialy in rural and remote areas where it has little influence over local custom. In
 general, family tradition and social mores do not discourage child labor.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-There is no minimum wage. The prevailing
 daily wage for unskilled workers allows only a very modest standard of living for
 a worker with a family. This low standard has been eroded further by inflation.
 The law prescribes a maximum 8-hour workday, but many workops and stores
 operate 10- to 12-hour shifts without penalty. The law limits the workweek to 48
 hours, but there is no specific provision for a 24-hour rest period. Government em-
 ployees work a 35-hour, 5-day workweek.
 There is no legislation providing workers with the right to remove themselves
 from dangerous work situations. Enforcement of health and safety regulations is
 lax. Some foreign-owned companies implement higher health, safety, and environ-
 mental standards than required in Yemen.
