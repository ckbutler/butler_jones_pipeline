 GERMANY
 The Federal Republic of Germany (FRG) is a constitutional
 federal republic and a parliamentary democracy. National power
 is divided among executive, legislative, and Judicial branches.
 The head of the Federal Government, the Chancellor,.is elected
 by the Bundestag, the- lower house of Parliament. The powers of
 the Chancellor and of the Parliament, which are substantial,
 are set down in the Basic Law-, Germany's constitution.
 Governmental authority is also divided between national and
 state governments. The states enjoy significant autonomy,
 especially in matters relating to law enforcement and the
 courts, culture and education, the environment, and social
 assistance.
 As a result of German unification on October 3, 1990, the laws
 and constitution of the FRG were extended to the Germans of the
 five new eastern states, who now enjoy the same rights and
 privileges as Germans in the west. Representatives-of the
 easternstates took their places in the Federal Parliament, and
 the people of those states gained a new judicial system.
 Organized essentially at the state (Land) level and operating
 under the direction of state governments, the German-police are
 well-trained and disciplined and scrupulously respect citizens*
 riqhts. In dealing with hostile. elements, including terrorists,
 special care is taken to respect the rights of the accused.
 The legacy of the East German secret police, the Stasi, was
 still felt in the allegations that individual politicans, police
 officials, physicians, educators-, and others had been affiliated.
 with the Stasi, as well as in unsubstantiated reports that the
 Stasi were still engaged in the surveillance of ordinary
 citizens.
 The industrialized market economy provided one of the highest
 standards of living in the world to those living in the western
 parts of Germany. In the eastern states, however, the
 transition to a free market economy introduced tumultuous
 change., The privatization or liquidation of state-owned
 enterprises continued at a rapid pace.- Unemployment became
 widespread, reaching nearly 12 percent in October. Those
 categorized as orr "short-time work"--but generally working no
 hours--accounted for an additional 13.6 percent of the work
 force. The Government extended unemployment henefi-ts,
 established retraining and special job programs,'and sought to
 attract investment capital to produce new jobs- Transfer
 payments to the eastern states significantly increased
 disposable income there.
 The Basic Law, adopted in 1949, rests firmly on the principIes
 of liberty, equality, and the free exercise of individual
 rights. In practice-, these human rights- are rigorously
 protected; further, protection against racial and ethnic
 intolerance is provided for under German law. A new, and
 disturbing phenomenon, however, emerged in 1991. Social and
 economic instability, especially among frustrated young people,
 contributed to the growth of racial and ethnic intolerance.
 Moreover, outbreaks of violence and harassment directed at
 non-European foreigners by rightwing extremists and neo-Nazis
 occurred with increasing frequency in the second half of 1991.
 Such events have taken place in both the eastern and western
 parts of Germany.

 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 Politically motivated killing by the Government or by mainstream
 political organizations is unknown. Terrorist groups on the
 far left and the far right, as well as Middle Eastern
 terrorists, however, continue to engage in political violence.
 The Red Army Faction (RAF) machinegunned the chancery of the
 U.S. Embassy in Bonn on February 13; there were no injuries in
 that incident. On April 1, the RAF assassinated the head of
 the Trust Fund Agency, which is charged with selling off and
 privatizing industries in the five new eastern states. Between
 two and six deaths are believed to have occurred in 1991 as a
 result of violence directed toward non-European foreigners by
 rightwing extremists and neo-Nazis.
 b. Disappearance
 Governmental or police authorities do not abduct, secretly
 arrest, or otherwise illegally detain persons.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Police authorities do not physically or mentally torture
 prisoners, nor do they engage in cruel, inhuman, or degrading
 treatment short of torture. There were no reports of torture
 in the new eastern states.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 No person may be arrested except on the basis of an arrest
 warrant issued by a competent judicial authority. Any person
 detained by the police must be brought before a judge and
 charged no later than the day following the day of
 apprehension. The court must then issue an arrest warrant with
 stated reasons for detention or order the person's release.
 Despite accusations that some officials in the east had
 previously been affiliated with the East German security police
 (Stasi), there have been no reported cases of arbitrary arrest
 or detention in the eastern states since German unification.
 There is no preventive detention. A suspect may be held in
 custody for up to 24 hours while awaiting a formal charge if
 there is evidence that he might seek to flee the country to
 avoid prosecution. The right of free access to legal counsel
 has been restricted only in the cases of some terrorists who
 were suspected of using contacts with lawyers to promote and
 continue terrorist activity even while in prison. Only judges
 may decide on the validity of any deprivation of liberty. Bail
 bond exists but is seldom employed. There is no exile.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Trials are public. The Basic Law assures due process and
 prohibits double jeopardy. The judiciary is free of both
 government interference and intimidation by terrorists. There
 are.no political prisoners.

 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The inviolability of the home is ensured by the Basic Law and
 fully respected in practice. Prior to nonconsensual entry by
 police into a home, a warrant must be issued by a judge or, in
 an emergency, by a public prosecutor. Electronic surveillance
 or monitoring of mail may be undertaken only after authorization
 by a court order. Membership in political parties is voluntary.
 Following the 1989 revolution in the German Democratic Republic,
 the routine and comprehensive surveillance once practiced in
 the eastern states ceased. Occasional rumors of continuing
 Stasi activity have not been proven.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and-Press
 The provisions of the Basic Law, an independent press-, an
 effective judiciary, and a functioning democratic political
 system combine to ensure freedom of speech and press.
 Criticism of the Government is unrestricted. The media and
 artistic works are not censored. Academic freedom is
 guaranteed. There is no censorship of foreign or domestic
 books. Newspapers and magazines are privately owned. Radio
 and television networks and stations function, for the most
 part, as corporations under special public laws. They are
 governed by independent boards made up of representatives of
 churches, political parties, and other organizations.
 Several private television cable stations and local television
 cable networks set up since the late 1980's continued to
 operate in 1991. Legislation was enacte in all states of- the
 FRG to facilitate and encourage private television stations
 using cable, satellites, and other "new" media. In accordance
 with the terms of the 1990 second unification treaty,
 legislation- was passed, which took effect at the end of
 December, that integrated former East German public
 broadcasting outlets into an al-German system.
 b. Freedom. of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The rights of assembly and association are fully respected, as
 is the right to demonstrate. Organizers of street
 demonstrations are required to obtain police permits beforehand
 and may be asked to pay a deposit to cover the repair of any
 damage to public facilities. Suc- police permits- are routinely
 granted. When, demonstrators have not, obtained the-r-equired
 permits-, police have exercised considerable restraint, showing
 concern ultimately-only for the continued functioning of public
 facilities and for the-safety of the general public-. There are
 no restrictions on freedom of assembly and association in the
 eastern states.
 Membership in nongovernmental organizations of all types,
 including political parties, is entirely open. Parties found
 to be "fundamentally antidemocratic" may, however, be outlawed.
 Under this constitutionally based provision, the Federal
 Constitutional Court, in the 1950's, declared both a neo-Nazi
 an- a Communist party to be illegal. This ban is still in
 effect, and several parties have been careful to stay just
 within the law.

 c. Freedom of Religion
 The full practice of religion is permitted. Almost 50
 different churches and religious denominations exist, but most
 of the population belongs to the Catholic and Protestant
 churches. Together with the small Jewish community, these
 churches hold a special legal status as corporate bodies under
 public law, giving them, for instance, the right to participate
 in a state-administered church tax system. The rest of the
 population either practices no religion or belongs to small
 independent Christian churches or other faiths, such as Islam
 (to which almost all Turkish guest workers and their families
 belong). The Government subsidizes church-affiliated schools
 and provides religious instruction in schools and universities
 for Protestants, Catholics, and members of the Jewish community.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 German citizens are free to move anywhere within the country
 and to leave and return at any time.
 The Basic Law guarantees automatic German citizenship and the
 right to legal residence without restrictions to ethnic Germans
 who arrive in Germany from Eastern Europe and the Soviet
 Union. The number of such ethnic Germans coming to settle in
 Germany in 1991 began to decrease from the all-time high of
 1990. In 1991, 221,995 of these ethnic Germans had registered
 to resettle in Germany. These numbers include 147,320 from the
 Soviet Union, 40,129 from Poland, and 32,178 from Romania.
 The right of asylum for foreigners who are politically
 persecuted is guaranteed under Article 16 of the Basic Law and
 respected in practice. The number of those seeking asylum
 continues to increase dramatically. During 1991, the total
 number of asylum seekers was 256,112, about a third more than
 in 1990. The German Government attributed much of this increase
 to the tripled number of asylum seekers from Yugoslavia.
 Once formally granted asylum status, and to a lesser extent
 while being processed, asylum seekers have essentially the same
 access to social welfare benefits as German citizens. Short of
 the right to vote, they also enjoy complete civil rights.
 While only about 7 percent of the asylum seekers succeed in
 their requests for political asylum, denial of political asylum
 does not automatically result in deportation. The vast
 majority of applicants who are rejected are typically allowed
 to remain in the country for other humanitarian reasons.
 Deportations have thus been extremely rare. The Government and
 opposition have agreed on establishing "assembly accommodations"
 for those asylum seekers considered least likely to be granted
 asylum. The stated goal is to finish the processing of these
 applications in only 6 weeks, after which unsuccessful
 applicants would be deported.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Under the Basic Law, Germany is ruled by a government chosen by
 the people through orderly elections based on universal
 suffrage. The Bundestag, which chooses the Chancellor, is
 elected through a mixture of direct constituency candidates and
 party lists. Members of the upper house of Parliament, the
 Bundesrat, are appointed by the state governments. New
 political parties are free to form and enter the political
 
 
 1119
 G     Y
 process, but the Basic Law and the state constitutions stipulate
 that parties must receive at least 5 percent of the vote in
 order to be represented in the federal and state parliaments.
 Although party discipline plays ari important role, voting on
 issues in the Bundestag is ultimately a matter of individual
 decision. The first all-German Bundestag elections took place
 on December 2, 1990.
 Women are entitled by law to full participation in political
 life, and all parties have expressed a commitment to encourage
 their greater participation. For example, the opposition
 Social Democratic Party's new rules require a 40-percent quota
 for women on all party committees and governing bodies, with an-
 eventual goal of 50-percent female representation in several
 years. The Cabinet Minister for Youth, Family, Women, and
 Health Affairs is responsible for furthering women's interests
 in both the public and private spheres.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Private nongovernmental human rights organizations operated
 freely and without harassment in all of Germany, as did
 international organizations. The Government considers the
 international promotion of human rights one of its highest
 priorities.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Denying access to shelter, health care, or education on the
 basis of race, religion, sex, ethnic background, political
 opinion, or citizenship is illegal.
 Some societal prejudice against foreign ethnic groups, such as
 Turks and Gypsies, does exist and is characterized by instances
 of verbal harassment, housing discrimination, and physical
 harassment and violence. Riqhtwing extremists and neo-Nazis
 appeared to be responsible for violent attacks against asylum
 seekers and other foreigners in which between two and six
 persons died.
 The Government has pursued a three-point policy with regard to.
 foreign workers, who comprise some 5.9 percent of the work
 force: integration of longtime residents, limitation of further
 entries, and repatriation Aid for those willing to return to
 their home countries. A national debate has been under way for
 some time over whether the rights of guest workers should be
 broadened to permit unlimited residence and the right to vote,
 or reduced by limiting the right of entry for dependent
 children.
 Women generally enjoy full and equal protection under the law,
 including property and inheritance rights. Young women
 experience difficulties in gaining access to training in some
 traditionally male fields, but recent court rulings and
 government pilot programs have helped break down some of these
 attitudinal and institutional barriers.
 Salaries for women in the private sector tend to be lower than
 salaries for men in similar jobs. The Government, through its
 Ministry for Youth, Family, Women, and Health Affairs, has
 acknowledged the existence of unequal, sex-differentiated pay
 scales in the private sector as a violation of the
 
 
 1120
 GERMANY
 constitutional prohibition against discrimination on the basis
 of sex, religious affiliation, or race. Several decisions by
 the national labor court in recent years have been in favor of
 women who initiated litigation to redress pay inequities.
 Movement on the issue of equal pay for equal work also takes
 place in the private sector in collective bargaining between
 unions and firms.
 With unification, abortion became a controversial issue. East
 German women continue to enjoy a legal right to an abortion
 without restriction during the first trimester, whereas
 abortion in the western part of Germany is permitted only on
 medical grounds or in case of economic difficulties. Under a
 compromise reached in 1990, abortion laws will continue to
 apply in the eastern states for 2 years, a period during which
 the Parliament is to develop a unified national law.
 Following currency unification and the privatization of industry
 in the eastern states, the involuntary unemployment rate for
 women increased about twice as fast as the rate for men. As of
 September, women made up 60 percent of the unemployed in the
 eastern states. "
 Violence against women, including wife beating, is not condoned
 either in law or in practice. The women's movement has urged
 public discussion of the problem and tougher penalties for
 crimes against women. According to the Interior Ministry, the
 number of rape cases officially reported in the ERG in 1990 rose
 by 2.5 percent over 1989. Some reports have indicated that
 marital rape occurs in one out of every five marriages.
 Attempts to bring forward legislation to make marital rape a
 punishable offense have so far been unsuccessful. Annual
 statistics for rape and violent crimes against women in the
 eastern states are not available, but government officials
 reported that violent and sexual crimes against both women and
 children increased significantly there in 1991.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 The right to associate freely, choose representatives, determine
 programs and policies to represent members' interests, and
 publicize views is recognized and freely exercised in Germany.
 About 35 percent of the total eligible work force belongs to
 the highly organized labor movement. When the Free German Trade
 Union, an appendage of the Communist Party in the eastern
 states, officially dissolved itself on September 14, 1990, its
 functions were taken over by independent trade unions in the
 ERG, most of them affiliated with the German Trade Union
 Federation (DGB). The DGB represents approximately 82 percent
 of organized workers and actively participates in various
 international and European trade union organizations.
 The right to strike is guaranteed by law, except for civil
 servants (including teachers) and personnel in sensitive
 positions, such as members of the armed forces, and was
 extensively exercised in 1991. International Labor Organization
 (ILO) bodies in 1991 were critical of the Government's broad
 definition of "essential services" which prevents teachers from
 legally striking. Sanctions imposed on teachers who struck in
 Hesse in 1989 and the replacement of striking postal workers in
 an earlier incident were the specific cases that provoked a
 complaint to the ILO.
 
 
 1121
 GERMANY
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 The right to organize and bargain collectively is guaranteed by
 the Basic Law and is widely practiced. No government mechanism
 to promote voluntary worker-employer negotiations is required
 because of a well-developed system of autonomous contract
 negotiations, now extended to the eastern states. There is a
 two-tiered bargaining system whereby basic wages and working
 conditions are established at the industry level and then
 adapted to the circumstances prevailing in particular
 enterprises through local negotiations. A characteristic of
 German industrial relations is the legally mandated system of
 works councils which provide a permanent forum for continuing
 selective worker participation in the management of the
 enterprise. Workers are fully protected against antiunion
 discrimination. Germany has no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Forced or compulsory labor is barred by the Basic Law and is
 nonexistent in practice.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 Federal law generally prohibits the employment of children
 under age 15, with a few exceptions: children aged 13 and 14
 may do farm work for up to 3 hours per day or may deliver
 newspapers for up to 2 hours per day; children aged 3 through
 14 may take part in cultural performances under stringent
 conditions with regard to number of hours, time of day, and
 form of activity. The Federal Labor Ministry effectively
 enforces the law through its Factory Inspection Bureau.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work-
 There is no legislative or administratively determined minimum
 wage rate. Wages and salaries are set either by collective
 bargaining agreements between industrial unions and employer
 federations or by individual contract. These agreements, which
 cover about 90 percent of all wage and-salary earners, set
 minimum pay rates and are legally enforceable. These minimum
 wage levels provide an adequate standard of living for workers
 and their families. The- number of hours of work pen week is
 regulated by contracts which directly or indirectly affect 80
 percent of the working population. The average workweek in the
 western part of Germany is 37.6 hours, and in the eastern
 states it is about 40 hours.
 Germany has an-extensive system of laws and regulations on.
 occupational safety and health and-incorporates a growing'body
 of European Community-wide standards into its own legislation.
 This system includes the right to refuse to perform dangerous
 or unhealthy work without jeopardizing employment. For each
 occupation, there is a comprehensive system of worker insurance
 carriers which enforce requirements for safety in the workplace.
 This system has recently been extended into the eastern states,
 where lax occupational health and safety standards and
 conditions under the Communist regime created serious long-term
 problems. The Federal Labor Ministry effectively enforces
 occupational safety and health standards through a comprehensive
 network of government structures, including the Federal
 Institute for Work Safety. At the local level, professional
 and trade associations--self-governing public law corporations
 with delegates of the employers and of the Government--oversee
 the prevention of workplace accidents as well as worker safety.
