 MALI
 Following a National Congress of the Democratic Union
 of the Malian People (UDPM) in March 1979, elections in
 June ratified party nominations for Mali's new 82 member
 National Assembly and confirmed Moussa Traore as President.
 The Military Committee of National Liberation (CMLN) which
 had governed Mali since 1968 was dissolved in July. The
 constitution, adopted by plebiscite in 1974 and now imple-
 mented, guarantees human rights as defined by the Universal
 Declaration of Human Rights, although guarantees can be
 suspended by the President during a national emergency. The
 tone set by President Traore reflects a commitment to
 greater respect for human rights.
 1.   Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 Torture is not authorized, but certain dissidents have
 been subjected to very cruel treatment in order to extract
 information.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 There are occasional credible reports of torture or cruel,
 inhuman, or degrading punishment in Mali. Police sometimes
 resort to physical abuse to extract information from sus-
 pected felons.
 c. Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 There have been occasional instances of arbitrary arrest and
 imprisonment, usually in connection with "political offenses".
 Similarly, there have been a few instances of prolonged
 detention without formal charges, usually in cases involving
 suspected treason.
 There are persistent but unsubstantiated rumors of political
 prisoners working alongside convicted felons under harsh
 conditions in salt mines in the far north. There are
 probab ly several dozen political prisoners, most of whom
 have also been convicted on corruption charges, which were
 pressed following arrests for "political offenses".
 Knowledge of prison conditions is limited. It appears,
 however, that conditions are severe, but in general not
 markedly out of line with living conditions for a large
 percentage of Mali's population. Prisoners enjoy access to
 family, friends, attorneys, and others--except when they are
 confined to remote northern areas where the terrain acts as
 a maximum security environment. Malian law does not recog-
 nize the principle of habeas corpus or its equivalent.
 There are no reports of clandestine incarceration or dis-
 appearances.
 d. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Pretrial and trial proceedings conform in theory to French
 precedents. In practice such proceedings can be protracted
 (eight months in the case of the February 1978 coup plotters).

 During detention defendants are made available to prosecut-
 ing and defense attorneys for prolonged questioning, and
 delays may also result from reconvening of special courts.
 Trials are generally short -- the October 1978 treason
 trials for 42 persons were completed in three days. An
 appeal procedure can include access to the President.
 e. Invasion of the Home
 There is some evidence of infrequent house-to-house searches,
 usually in the context of some specific political incident,
 or when hoarding of scarce commodities is suspected. The
 Government confiscates property on occasion to meet shortages
 in the State corporations, but provides a receipt for redemp-
 tion later.
 2.   Government Policies Relating to the Fulfillment
 of Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care
 and Education:
 Mali's government is committed to the goal of economic
 development and a better quality of life, and its policies
 are focused on responding to the needs of the poor. Accord-
 ing to UN estimates Mali ranks among the world's very
 poorest nations. Poverty is widespread and pervasive.
 Access to health care depends to some extent on proximity to
 larger towns; a public health mechanism is provided for
 salaried government employees, but many people receive
 little or no help. The Government has stated its commitment
 to provide health care to the village level and has encouraged
 several donor-supported projects with this aim. Education is
 free but limited to approximately 15 percent of the eligible
 population. The percentage, however, has been rising steadily
 in recent-years and Mali's largest budget item is education
 (30 percent of the total national budget). The labor
 movement is weak and subject to close government monitoring.
 Organized labor is limited to the state corporations and a
 small number of private firms.
 Economic development programs are aimed at improving the
 lives of the country's overwhelmingly rural agricultural and
 nomadic population. Bamako's rapidly increasing indigent
 population, often unemployed and victim of drought-induced
 dislocation, is now the subject of increasing concern.
 Although the concentration of wealth is not pronounced in
 Mali, the drought of the early 70's intensified the impover-
 ishment of nomadic tribes and subsistence cultivators, and
 provided certain people, including some government officials,
 a chance to enrich themselves through diversion of relief
 proceeds. President Traore has sought to reduce corruption
 through frequent warnings and periodic disciplining of some
 government officials.    However, expectations that the
 ministers selected in July to replace CMLN officials would
 intensify the anti-corruption campaign have not yet been
 fulfilled. Corruption remains a pervasive and, to date,
 persistent problem in Mali.

 3.   Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Includ-
 ing:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and
 Assembly
 Organized political activity is permitted only under the
 umbrella of the single national party headed by the President.
 The party recognizes special organizations for women, youth
 and labor. The state controls all public expressions of
 views and would not brook any direct public criticism of its
 authority. In March 1979, small groups disappointed at the
 lack of flexibility during the transition to civilian rule
 protested the decision of President Traore to serve simulta-
 neously as President and Party Chief. They were arrested,
 but later released.
 The government maintains firm control without difficulty.
 Recently, however, it has allowed the media to express
 grievances concerning unfulfilled promises, sanitation
 problems, and other matters. Further, President Traore has
 invited criticism of various government departments during
 his visits within Mali.
 Malians are free to assemble for religious, social and
 professional purposes. Missionaries report that religious
 freedom is more widespread than at any time in Malian history.
 The new Malian constitution restricts opposition to the
 incumbent regime or the national political party, and grants
 substantial powers to the president.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel and Emigration
 Freedom of movement within Mali is generally unrestricted.
 Intercity travelers are sometimes subject to police checks,
 especially at night, which are allowed by law, ostensibly to
 restrict movement of contraband goods. There are no barriers
 to emigration.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 The National Union of the Malian People is a single party
 endowed by the constitution with wide-ranging powers vis-a-
 vis the legislature and to a certain extent the executive.
 An amendment to the 1974 constitution adopted in March
 removed the impediment to the Chief of State serving simul-
 taneously as head of the party. Traore's role as party head
 permits him to exercise direct control over many aspects of
 the new legislative system. It is too early to determine
 how well the party will function as the vehicle for articu-
 lating the popular will.
 There is a widespread sense of dissatisfaction with the
 government's orchestration of the transition process.
 This has led to apathy and some cynicism about the Presi-
 dent's commitment to democracy. In the recent municipal
 elections, however, the single party slates proposed for
 several major towns were rejected by the voters who proposed
 and elected slates more to their liking.
 4.   Government Attitude and Record Regarding Inter-
 national and Non-governmental Investigation of
 Alleged Violations of Human Rights:
 The Department is unaware of any outstanding requests for
 outside investigation of human rights conditions in Mali.
 It is believed that the government would respond favorably
 to such a request from a responsible organization.
