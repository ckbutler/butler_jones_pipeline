 AZERBAIJAN
 Azerbaijan declared its independence on August 30, 1991. Progress toward a
 democratic society suffered a severe setback following the June 1993 downfall of the
 democratically elected President, Abulfez Elcibey.
 Heydar Aliyev, a farmer Communist Party First Secretary of Azerbaijan and So-
 vie t Politburo member, assumed presidential powers following a period of intense
 strife brought on by the loss of large portions of the country to Armenian rebels in
 Nagorno-Wsrabakh, a predominantly Armenian enclave within Azerbaijan. The
 events in June were facilitated by the failure of the Azerbaijan Popular Front (APF)
 government to hold parliamentary elections. A referendum on August 29 confirmed
 the lack of public confidence in Elcibey, and Aliyev won presidential elections held
 on October 3.
 Under President Elcibey and the APF, the Ministry of National Security appeared
 to have been relatively inactive; under the Aliyev regime, it has arrested APF lead-
 ers without bringing charges and is believed to have resumed surveillance activities.
 Azerbaijan continued to maintain the structure of a centralized command econ-
 omy. Disintegration of the economy continued as a result of war, social instability,
 and the general collapse of the currency and industry. The manat, the local currency
 introduced in August 1992, remained tied to the Russian ruble. Reviving ruble-de-
 nominated (soft currency) trade links with Russia was one reason cited by Aliyev
 for his decision to take Azerbaijan into the Commonwealth of Independent States
 (CIS) in September. Badly needed economic reforms remain to be implemented. Oil
 is the key foreign exchange earner.
 The war in and around Nagorno-Karabakh continued to be the most significant
 factor in the human rights situation. Both sides engaged in frequent human rights
 abuses and violations of humanitarian law including the killing of civilians, hos-
 tage-taking, and ransoming the remains of te dead.
 Armenian forces in Nagorno-Karabakh launched offensives outside the boundaries
 of the Nagorno-Karabakh autonomous region, seizing Kalbacar in March; Agdam in
 July- andPuzuli, Cabrayil, Qubadli, Zangilan, and other towns to the south during
 the August-October period. The attacking forces looted and burned all villages in the
 areas they overran, forcing some 500,000 people, as well as earlier displaced persons
 who had settled in areas subsequently overrun, to flee their homes. The total refu-
 gee population rose to over 1 million out of a total population of 7.5 million.
 The war and attendant social instability gave rise to many human rights abuses
 even before the fall of Elcibey, although the situation worsened thereafter. The state
 of emergency, which the APF government enacted in April, permitted police to enter
 homes without warrants, introduced press censorship, banned demonstrations, and
 restricted travel, among other measures. Even after Acting President Aliyev ended
 the state of emergency in September, the Government continued to impose
 prepublication censorship. Elements within Azerbaijani society hostile to the pres-
 ence of Armenians kidnaped Armenian and part-Armenian residents of Baku to be
 exchanged for Azeri hostages in Nagorno-Karabakh. As Acting President Aliyev con-
 centrated power into his own hands, he took steps to suppress political opposition.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Extrajudicial Killing.-According to supporters of rebel leader
 Surat Huseynov, APF government troops which attacked his forces in Gance in July
 were responsible for the deaths of some civilians among the 70 persons killed. APF
 supporters charge that Huseynov's forces took captive the commander of the Presi-
 dential Guard during the en a ment and butchered him in his hospital bed. In ad-
 dition, Huseynov's forces killed several local administrators during their march on
 Baku in June.
 b. Disappearance.-Hostage-taking by both sides in the Nagorno-Karabakh con-
 flict remained endemic. Armenian forces from Nagorno-Karabakh took hostage hun-
 dreds of civilians, including 100 in hte Kalbacar region alone, during their offensives
 against Azeri-inhabited regions. Five Azeri civilians, along with a number of sol-
 diers, were traded back to Azerbaijan on September 22 in exchange for six Russian
 mercenaries sentenced to death in 1992 for fighting alongside Nagorno-Karabakh's
 
 
 Armenians. Azerbauan hostage-taking, which had been on the decline, increased
 after the fall of Elcibey, as ethnic Armenian civilians, mostly residents of Azer-
 baian, were kidnaped from their own homes and from public transport. Many of
 these were "arrested" and taken to the police by Azeris who wanted the Armenians'
 apartments.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 APF supporters alleged that the perpetrators of the events in June tortured ex-Par-
 liament Speaker Isa Qambar and other APF figures after their arrests. However,
 Qambar denied these charges upon his release in August.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-On June 4, APF government forces at-
 tempted to suppress an armed mutiny in Gance by a regiment led by Surat
 Huseynov, who was demanding the overthrow of the Government and attempting
 to achieve this by suborning the loyalty of the rest of the military. Huseynov's
 troops defeated progovernment forces and arrested the Attorney General, the Dep-
 uty Minister of National Security, and the Deputy Minister of Internal Affairs (the
 r-st two had parliamentary immunity from arrest). These arrests were sanctioned
 only on Jul 16, afer Huseynov had marched on Baku, forced President Elcibey to
 flee, toppled the Government (with Heydar Aliyev assuming presidential powers),
 and been named Prime Minister. On the same day, Parliament allowed the arrest
 of its former speaker, Isa Qambar, and former Minister of National Security
 Fakhrettin Takhmazov without formal charges. Qambar was arrested inside the
 Parliament building--even before Parliament voted to strip him of his parliamen-
 tary immunity-and taken away to Gance as the personal captive of Surat
 Huseynov. He was released on Augst 17 after strong protests by the United States,
 Turkey, and the United Nations; lrakhmazov was released a month later.
 Between September 12 and 22, when the state of emergency was lifted, an un-
 known number of APF leaders and some of their family members were detained,
 released, rearrested, and released again in harassing actions aimed esjpecially at sti-
 fhing protest against Aliyev's decisionto bring Azerbaijan into the CIS. Reportedly,
 34 APF leaders and activists remained in prison at year's end. Members of the secu-
 rity formes who remained loyal to the Elcibey government, including Arif Pasayev,
 Popular Front military commander of Lacin, and Isakhan Aahurov, the police chief
 of Qaax who helped enforme a cease-fire on the border with Armenia in 1992, also
 were arrested.
 In the month leading up to the June 4 action, the APF government used state
 of emergency legislation to arrest supporters of the National Independence Party
 and other opposition fors.
 e. Denial of Fair Public TriaL.-The legal system of Azerbaijan remains largely
 unchanged from Soviet rule. There are district and municipal courts and a Supreme
 Court, which serves as a court of appeals. Growing judicial independence came to
 a halt in July when the Government faed Supreme Court Chief Justice Tahir
 Kerimli, an APF appointee, for his loyalty to ousted President Elcibey.
 Defendants have the right to be present at their trials, confront witnesses, and
 present evidence, and trials are generally public. Exceptions to public trials are
 cases involving state military secrets and those in which the judge determines that
 a closed trial would be more appropriate in dealing with sexual offenses, as for in-
 stance during the testimony of a rape victim. Defendants may choose their own at-
 torney, and the court appoints an attorney for those without one. Defendants have
 the right to appeal, as does the prosecutor. The presumption of innocence has not
 been incorporated into the criminal cde.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-Police
 had the authority to enter homes under the state of emergency in effect from April
 until September. The Soviet surveillance apparatus, reorganized as the Ministry of
 National Security, continued to operate under the APF government. Under the
 Aliyev Government, the Ministry became more active. It is widely believed that tele-
 phones, especially those of foreigners and prominent political and business figures,
 were tapped.
 g. Use of Excessive Force and Violations of Humanitarian Law in Internal Con-
 flicts.-The conflict in and around Nagrno-Karabakh has steadily increased in se-
 verity since violence began in 1988. All parties to the conflict engaged inindiscrimi-
 nate shelling and rocket fire against civilian targets, including in both directions
 along the Armenia-Azerbairan border. The Awerbaijanis also engaged in lsed-wing
 air attacks against civilian targets in both Nagorno-Karahakh and Armenia. All par-
 ties to the conflict have cut normal trade and transportation links to the other sides,
 causing severe hardship to civilians in Nagorno-Karabakh, Armenia, and the Azer-
 baijani exclave of Naxcivan.
 In 1993 ethnic Armenians began to attack ethnic Azeri and Kurdish areas outside
 the bounds of Nagorno-Karabakh. In March, as peace talks were under way in G -
 
 
 791
 neva, the Nagorno-Karabakh Armenians captured the province of Kalbacar between
 Nagorno-Karabakh and Armenia. According to reliable eyewitnesses, the entire pop-
 ulation fled, and ethnic Armenians looted and destroyed all villages and towns to
 discourage the return of those displaced.
 During the political upheaval inside Azerbaijan that these events caused, the
 Nagorno-Karabakh Armenians took advantage of the collapse of the Azerbaijani
 army to capture Agdam to the east in July and large parts of the Fuzuli, Cabrayil,
 Qubadli, and Zangilan regions to the south and southwest in September. As before,
 they drove out the population and looted and burned the provincial capitals and
 most of the villages in an apparent effort to create an uninhabitable zone around
 N aorno-Karabakh proper. The United Nations Security Council condemned these
 actions.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-There were some restrictions on freedom of
 speech and press under the APF government. That government's Minister of Inter-
 nal Affairs, Iskandar Hamidov, continued to harass and beat journalists whose arti-
 cles he disliked. After the events in June, however, restrictions became more severe.
 After the ouster of the APF government (including Hamidov), the new regime
 used censorship in a more methodical and intensive manner. The censor banned ar-
 ticles and entire editions and, on September 13, even confiscated an entire press run
 of the newspaper Azadlyq and had it burned.
 The situation improved somewhat after the lifting of the state of emergency on
 September 22, although official censorship continued. In response to an open letter
 from the editors of several newspapers, protesting that censorship should have
 ended with the lifting of the state of emergency, the Cabinet's Office for the Protec-
 tion of State Secrets decreed on September 30 that only military, not political, cen-
 sorship would remain in effect. Censorship in fact decreased after the state of emer-
 gency was lifted, and even further after this announcement.
 The number of newspapers available both in Azeri and Russian, did not dimin-
 ish-one paper called itself Newspaper kumber 525 because it was the 525th paper
 to register. Several opposition papers, including at least five major newspapers sym-
 pathetic to or officially published by the Azerbaijan Popular Front, the Musavat
 Party, and the Azerbaijan National Independence Party, the main political opposi-
 tion, continued to publish. Small sensationalist papers continued to publish inves-
 tigative interviews and news items.
 At year's end, a media campaign was under way against the opposition press.
 After an effort to impose political censorship failed in Parliament on November 26,
 most papers-including opposition papers-were told that beginning on December 3
 they would receive no ofset masters with which to publish. After strong protests
 by the international community, some newspapers, including the principal opposi-
 tion papers, were given permission to use offset masters they had in stock. On De-
 cember 6, Parliament institutionalized military censorship and authorized the Attor-
 ney General to close newspapers for 1 month for publishing information "contrary
 to the interests of Azerbaijan" or libelous of individuals.The military censor is
 known to have excised articles containing purely political criticism of government
 figures unrelated to the war effort.
 In September a number of women were arrested for passing out leaflets prtesting
 against Azerbaijan's joining the CIS. They were charged under the state of emer-
 gency regulations banning demonstrations.
 Radio and television were entirely controlled by the Government, and after the
 downfall of the Elcibey government they broadcast frequent programs exoressing ad-
 ulation for government figures, especially President Aliyev. The opposition had little
 or no aaress to the mass media.
 A number of prominent academics lost their jobs after the events in June, report-
 edly for their connections with the APF government. They were replaced by figures
 from the Soviet era.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The state of emergency in ef-
 fect from April until September formally banned demonstrations. In fact, however,
 demonstrations occuri-ed wgularly before the overthrow of President Elcibey. After
 that, the new Government broke up demonstrations, mostly organized by Elcibey's
 APF supporters, using force if necessary. On one occasion in July, gunfire was used
 to break up a demonstration outside the APF's headquarters. Some APF demonstra-
 tions were later allowed to take place when it became apparent that the party had
 few supporters still willing to come to rallies.
 Political parties and associations were in general allowed to function freely, and
 a number of parties orignally a liated with the Popular Front united to rm a
 "Democratic Congress." he APF, however, was harassed by the authorities, and a
 
 
 number of its activists around the country were arrested. In some cases they were
 released quickly, rearrested, and released again in a clear attempt at intimidation.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-There is no state religion.
 Most Azerbaianis are Muslims, predominantly of the Shi'a sect, but there are sig-
 nificant Russian Orthodox and Jewish communities. All three are represented in a
 "Caucasus House," chaired by the Muslim Shaykh Al-Islam, which represents the
 interfaith religious establishment of Azerbaijan. All faiths practiced their religions
 without restrictions, with one important exception: Armenian churches, many van-
 dalized in past years, remained closed, and few of the Armenians left in Azerbaijan
 would have felt secure enough to attend them had they been open. New mosques
 continued to open during 1993. There is one Muslim seminary; Christians and Jews
 must go elsewhere for clerical training. Muslim clerics from Turkey and Iran, Jew-
 ish clerics from Israel and the United States, and Christian clerics from Russia, the
 United States, and elsewhere were given full access to the country.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.--State of emergenc  regulations in force after April severely limited
 travel to areas near the front. The Ministry of National Security also used the state
 of emergency to create-under the APF government-an Iranian border zone in the
 south from which all nonresidents were excluded. The APF government restricted
 travel to the exclave of Naxcivan in the spring as tensions mounted between the
 Baku leadership and Heydar Aliyev, then chairman of Naxcivan's Supreme Soviet.
 After Aliyev's return to Baku and President Elcibey's June 17 flight to Naxcivan,
 these restrictions were intensified. The Government released former Parliament
 Speaker Isa Qambar, the former Minister of National Security, and others from
 prison on condition that they not leave Baku; it filed no charges against them. In
 December the Government denied Qambar and some members of his political
 party-including at least one who was never investigated for criminal activity-
 passports to travel to Turkey.
 The Government officially recognized freedom of emigration. Jewish emigration to
 Israel continued, with over 23,000 leaving since 1990, although only 749 emigrated
 in the first 6 months of 1993. Some 18,000 Armenians and part-Armenians, mostly
 in mixed marriages, remained in the country. Some of these were deprived of all
 documents for both internal and external travel. In general, members of minorities
 wishing to emigrate are harassed by low-level officials seeking bribes; this is espe-
 cially the case of draft-age men, who are required to obtain documentation from sev-
 eral levels of military authorities before they may leave for any international travel.
 All citizens of Azerba'jan wishing to travel abroad must first obtain exit visas or
 official passports from the Government. In at least one case, the authorities denied
 an exit visa to a person wishing to attend a conference on the Azeri-Armenian con-
 flict.
 By autumn the number of refugees and displaced persons in Azerbaijan was
 891,000, according to figures accepted by the International Committee of the Red
 Cross (ICRC). By year's end the tally used by the United Nations High Commis-
 sioner for Refugees was just under 1 million. Close to 500,000 fled the Nagorno-
 Karabakh Armenian offensives into Azeri-inhabited areas between March and Sep-
 tember alone, joining the 150,000 who fled in 1992. The refugee population also con-
 sisted of 48,000 Akhiskha (Meskhetian) Turks who fled pogroms in Uzbekistan in
 1990, and 200,000 Azeris and Kurds expelled from Armenia in 1988 in retaliation
 for anti-Armenian pogroms in Azerbaijan. These pogroms, which recurred until
 1990, drove about 350,000 Armenians to flee Azerbaijan for Armenia, Russia, and
 other states. Another 50,000 Armenians have fled the fighting in Nagorno-
 Karabakh.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment:
 Citizens of Azerbaijan do not have the right to change their government by peace-
 ful means. In June the democratically elected president, Abulfez Elcibey, was over-
 thrown, and Heydar Aliyev assumed presidential powers. He tried to legitimize the
 transfer of power by holding a referendum on August 29, which confirmed the lack
 of public confidence in Elcibey, and presidential elections on October 3, which he
 won.
 In theory, the President shares power with a 50-member National Council (Milli
 Majlis), which was formed in 1991 under the Communist regime, with half of its
 members drawn from the opposition and half from the Communists. In 1992 the
 APF regime dissolved the Supreme Soviet, which had been Azerbaijan's parliament,
 and transferred its functions to the National Council. There has been no indication
 whether early parliamentary elections will be held.
 
 
 793
 There were no restrictions on women or minorities participating in politics. Mi-
 norities such as Lezghis and Talysh formed regional groupings in Parlament and
 published newspapers in their own languages. There are two Islamic religious par-
 ties.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Local human rights observers were not active in 1993. Those presenting them-
 selves as human rights groups were generally linked with one political party or an-
 other. Some of the most active figures accepted academic grants in the United
 States and Europe, and were not present in Azerbaijan for much of 1993.
 The Government expressed willingness to receive delegations from international
 human rights organizations and actively solicited observers for the August 29 ref-
 erendum and October 3 presidential election. Heydar Aliyev met with the visiting
 president of the U.S. Helsinki Watch and expressed his willingness to abide by the
 norms of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe and other inter-
 national agreements. Meanwhile, however, human rights violations continued.
 ICRC access to prisoners of war and others was sporadic.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 Women.-Women nominally enjoyed the same legal rights as men, including the
 right to participate in all aspects of political, economic, and social life. Heydar
 Aliyev appointed several women to senior government positions, including that of
 state secretary (head of the presidential apparatus). The most active supporters of
 the APF after the overthrow of Elcibey were the party's women's groups.
 In general, women are given extensive opportunities for education, work, and po-
 litica activity. In practice, social norms of the Caucasus tend to keep women in sub-
 ordinate positions.
 Violence against women is a taboo subject in Azerbaijan's patriarchal society. In
 rural areas, wives have no real recourse against violence by their husbands, regard-
 less of the law. Rape is severely punishable but, especially in rural areas, only a
 small fraction of offenses are prosecuted.
 Children.-Although the Government is committed to the welfare of children, it
 had no resources in 1993 to devote to them.
 National /Racial Ethnic Minorities.-Previous declarations on minority rights re-
 mained in effect in 1993, and, with the exception of ethnic Armenians, minorities
 enjoyed full rights. The position of Russian speakers actually improved after the
 events in June, as several APF policies to deemphasize Russian in the schools were
 droped. The APF policies had mandated that more academic subjects (not including
 Russian language and literature) be taught in Azeri, not Russian.
 The 18,000 ethnic Armenians and part-Armenians, most of them members of
 mixed families, continued to live in an atmosphere of fear and uncertainty.
 Kidnapings of ethnic Armenians from Baku continued, as did other forms of harass-
 ment and persecution. A Baku newspaper began in September to publish, district
 by district, the names of Armenians in Baku receiving pensions through the mail,
 including some with purely Azeri surnames. The newspaper used highly emotional
 language in introducing these lists, in an apparent attempt to incite an anti-Arme-
 nian pogrom. The Government stopped pubition of these lists, and the editor of
 the paper was fired.
 There are credible reports of the denial of medical treatment to ethnic Armenians
 and confiscation of their travel and residence documents. Most of the Armenians
 who lost jobs in previous years remained unemployed. Many were too frightened to
 appear in public.
 People with Disnhiities.-Nn legislatinn nr otherwise mandated provision of acces-
 sibility for the disabled has been enacted.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Azerbaijani labor unions continued to operate as
 they did under the Soviet system. However, the Azerbaijani Labor Federation is no
 longer linked to Moscow. Unions continued to be highly dependent upon the Govern-
 ment bu  were free to form federations and participate in international bodies.
 There is a right to strike. A number of strikes were reported in the press in 1993;
 the Confederation reported no retribution against strikers.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively--Collective bargaining re-
 mained at a rudimentary level. Wages were decreed by relevant government min-
 istries for enterprises and organizations within their budgets. Both managers and
 employees at state enterprises are considered to be union members under the Soviet
 holdover system. On December 13, 200 policemen invaded a military factory and ar-
 
 
 rested the manager, who was protected by workers. The work force then went out
 on strike.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced or compulsory labor is pro-
 hibited by law and is not known to be practiced. There is no government office that
 enforces this prohibition.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The minimum employment age is
 16. Children aged 14 are allowed to work during vacations with the consent of their
 parents and the certification of a physician. Children aged 15 may work if the work-
 place's labor union does not object. Eight years of education are compulsory. This
 minimum is enforced by employers under the control of trade union organizations.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-A nationwide administrative minimum wage,
 set by decree, was raised numerous times in 1993 to offset inflation. The minimum
 wage as of December 17 amounted to $3.60 (900 manats) per month. It is not known
 how effectively the payment of the minimum wage was enforced. The extended fami-
 ly's "safety net" and reliance on outside sources of income generally assured a de-
 cent living.
 The legal workweek is 41 hours. There is at least one 24-hour rest period, in some
 cases two, during the workweek. Health and safety standards exist but are by and
 large ignored in the workplace.
