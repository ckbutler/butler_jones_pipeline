 BURUNDI
 The Republic of Burundi is a one-party state led by President
 Pierre Buyoya, an army major who came to power in a coup in
 September 1987. As President of the Republic and head of the
 80-member National Party for Unity and Progress (UPRONA)
 Central Committee, the ultimate decisionmaking body, Buyoya
 exercises considerable executive, legislative, and regulatory
 powers. The 22-member predominantly civilian Cabinet manages
 the day-to-day business of government. UPRONA is the only
 significant political entity in Burundi.
 Throughout its history, Burundi has been plagued by ethnic
 conflict, characterized by the traditional dominance of the
 minority-Tutsi ethnic group over the majority Hutu ethnic
 group. Following violence in 1988, in which 5,000 to 10,000
 people were killed, Buyoya appointed an ethnically balanced
 Cabinet and a high-level assembly of representatives of both
 ethnic communities, the National Unity Commission, to study
 and recommend long-term solutions to the ethnic problem. Its
 report, issued in May 1989, calls for sweeping changes in
 nearly every aspect of national life, culminating in the
 adoption of democratic institutions.
 In May President Buyoya presented the draft National Unity
 Charter to the Burundi people and announced a timetable for
 political reform. This document is intended to provide a
 guarantee of equal rights for all Burundis regardless of
 ethnicity and thus help bring about national reconciliation.
 The Government has scheduled a referendum for its adoption in
 February 1991. The ruling Military Committee for National
 Salvation was dissolved in late December and replaced by the
 transitional UPRONA Central Committee  A constitutional
 commission is to be convened in early 1991, with the declared
 mandate of creating permanent civilian institutions for the
 nation.
 The security police are responsible for internal state
 security, including the monitoring of dissent; a much larger
 regular police force is responsible for maintaining law and
 order. The state security police have the same powers of
 arrest as the regular police and are subject to the same
 process of judicial review. An ethnically balanced National
 Security Council was created in 1990 to oversee the activities
 of the various security forces, which continue to be dominated
 by the Tutsi ethnic group.
 Landlocked Burundi is extremely poor and densely populated.
 Over four-fifths of the working population is engaged in
 subsistence agriculture, working small, privately owned
 plots. The small monetary economy is based on coffee, which
 accounts for 85 percent of exports, and other cash crops. The
 donor community is supporting a structural adjustment program
 designed to reverse the economy's heavy dependence on
 centralized administration. AIDS is an increasingly serious
 economic and social problem.
 While a special party congress in late December provided the
 potential for far-reaching political reform, at year's end
 restrictions on freedom of expression, assembly, and the right
 of citizens to change their government by democratic means
 remained in place. Important progress was made in 1990 in the
 campaign to eradicate ethnic discrimination, Burundi's most
 serious human rights problem. In addition to beginning to
 address the problem of ethnic imbalance in the security forces
 
 
 BURUNDI
 through the new National Security Council, the Government
 further eased tensions by releasing all those detained as a
 result of the August 1988 ethnic violence as well as those
 detained for political subversion in March 1989.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1   Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 There were no reports of politically motivated or government-
 instigated killings in Burundi in 1990.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reports of politically instigated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Torture is forbidden by law, but cruel treatment of suspects
 or detainees is known to occur in the form of beatings at the
 time of arrest or interrogation. Security forces are rarely
 disciplined for such abuses.
 The Buyoya regime allows regular inspection of prison
 conditions and visits to prisoners by representatives of the
 International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), which
 established an office in Burundi in 1990. While visits to
 detainees were occasionally restricted in 1988 and 1989, there
 were no known instances of restricted access to any prisoners
 or detainees in 1990. Prison conditions remain severe in
 Burundi due to lack of adequate hygiene, medical care, and
 food. The Government has begun a program of gradually
 improving conditions; to date, efforts have been focused on
 increasing the supply of food and clothing.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Police officers are empowered to detain suspects without an
 arrest warrant but must submit a written report to the public
 prosecutor's office within 24 hours. The public prosecutor
 examines the report and may either order the release of the
 detainee or issue an arrest warrant valid for 5 days. The
 public prosecutor must then state the charges before a
 magistrate in the presence of the detainee. The magistrate
 either releases the detainee or issues orders confirming the
 detention, initially for 15 days and subsequently for 30-day
 periods as necessary to prepare the case for trial.
 There is no absolute limit on the length of pretrial
 detention. Bail is set only in cases of embezzlement or
 similar crimes involving financial wrongdoing. In general,
 the prescribed procedures for arrest and imprisonment are
 followed. However, time limits for issuance of arrest
 warrants and appearance before a magistrate are often
 exceeded, usually due to a shortage of magistrates and
 prosecutors. The Government has begun to address this problem
 by increasing the number of magistrates.
 There were no known political detainees at the end of 1990.
 On the occasion of the September 3 anniversary of the founding
 of the Third Republic, 51 persons detained in the wake of the
 
 
 34
 BURUNDI
 August 1988 ethnic violence and 20 persons'arrested in March
 1989 in connection with an alleged coup plot were granted
 executive amnesty and released from custody. Formal charges
 had never been filed against any of the detainees. Amnesty
 International's 1990 report was critical of the arbitrary
 manner by which some of those released were originally
 detained: "It appeared that some were imprisoned on account
 of their leading role in their community, not because of any
 direct involvement in the intercommunal killings of August
 1988."
 With the exception of those who have left the country, the
 signatories of the August 1988 open letter to President Buyoya
 criticizing the army's role in the ethnic violence, including
 the six Hutu intellectuals who were detained for 4 months,
 have been fully reintegrated in their former positions.
 During 1990 several Jehovah's Witnesses were arrested by local
 authorities. All were later released by order of the
 Government, which told a delegation of visiting Witnesses in
 June that it had issued orders to stop arrests of individual
 members on religious grounds. No Witnesses were known to be
 in custody for religious reasons at the end of the year.
 The Government does not exile its nationals as a means of
 political control. Since his ouster in 1987, ex-president
 Bagaza and his spouse have been denied permission to return to
 Burundi, but the Buyoya Government has stated that it is
 willing to negotiate the conditions of their return. Three
 Bagaza daughters, all minors, remain in Burundi with
 relatives; they are free to leave, however.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The judiciary is not independent; it is expected to adhere to
 the guidance and recommendations of the party, the Government,
 and the President. Judges are appointed by and serve at the
 pleasure of the President. In practice, there is a high
 degree of autonomy in the court's daily administration of
 justice. The President has the power to pardon or reduce
 sentences. In cases of major political interest, the
 Government occasionally intervenes in the judicial process.
 Burundi has separate court systems to deal with military,
 civil/criminal, and state security cases. In addition, the
 Cour des Comptes (Court of Accounts) was established in 1989
 to investigate and prosecute cases of official corruption, a
 special target of government policy. To date, most of the
 cases this Court has handled involve actions that occurred
 under the previous regime.
 Military tribunals have jurisdiction over military personnel,
 and persons suspected of committing crimes against the
 military. The cases of those detained in connection with an
 armed attack by Burundi refugees from Tanzania against a
 military camp in August, which resulted in several deaths
 among soldiers and attackers, are being handled by the
 military justice system. The State Security Court has
 jurisdiction over both civilian and military personnel, and
 its proceedings need not be made public. To date, this Court
 has been used only once, in prosecuting ex-president Micombero
 in the mid-1970's.
 Burundi law provides the right to counsel, and indigents are
 provided defense counsel by the State. Pretrial proceedings
 
 
 BURUNDI
 may involve lengthy investigations. The courts are hampered
 by a lack of trained legal personnel and by heavy case loads.
 The Government released over 2,000 prisoners in September,
 including many who were serving time for petty criminal
 offenses, just prior to the Pope's visit and for the declared
 purpose of promoting national reconciliation. The Government
 maintains that no political prisoners remain.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The inviolability of the home and of private correspondence
 were provided for in the suspended constitution and are still
 respected in practice. A judicial warrant is required for a
 law enforcement official to enter and search a private
 residence. The state security office monitors political
 dissent through the state security police and by employing
 informers who report on discontent and dissent as well as on
 criminal activity. Membership in the sole legal party is not
 required by law.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 While significant restrictions on freedom of expression remain
 in place, there was unprecedented public debate on formerly
 taboo subjects, including ethnic relations and official
 corruption. However, political debate is largely confined to
 UPRONA meetings, the forum for prolitical and social dialog
 officially sanctioned by the Government. The Government's
 tolerance for public criticism outside the party is limited.
 In the weeks leading to the Pope's visit in September, the
 Government tolerated the circulation of numerous opposition
 tracts, some signed by persons resident in Burundi. There
 were no known arrests of any of the signatories.
 The Government regulates domestic print and broadcast media.
 A French-language daily and a Kirundi-language weekly
 newspaper are published by the Ministry of Information, which
 also operates the domestic radio and television stations. The
 official media are traditionally required to support the
 fundamental policies of the party and the Government. Some
 criticism of the Government is permitted, but journalists are
 state employees and subject to disciplinary action if their
 criticism goes beyond what is considered tolerable. The
 Government has interfered on occasion with the distribution of
 foreign news publications but has never interfered with radio
 reception from foreign sources. Public censorship occurs only
 in the case of sexually explicit foreign film material or
 publications.
 Following its earlier pledge to respect freedom of expression,
 on December 13, 1988, the Buyoya regime issued an ordinance
 allowing but also regulating private print media in Burundi.
 (Private broadcast media are not yet authorized.) Any news
 publications must have prior authorization from the Ministry
 of Information. Two news publications have emerged under the
 Government's liberalized media policy, one a Catholic biweekly
 in Kirundi and the other a monthly magazine published in
 French by an association of Burundian intellectuals. The
 editorial boards of both publications thus far have refrained
 from taking controversial positions on critical issues.
 
 
 BURUNDI
 Academic freedom is limited, in that primary and secondary
 school teachers are expected to support government policies.
 Professors at the University of Burundi come from a wide
 assortment of national backgrounds and are generally permitted
 to lecture freely in their subject areas, conduct research,
 and draw independent conclusions. Three university professors
 were among the six persons detained for signing the August
 1988 open letter to President Buyoya.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 These rights are restricted. No political meetings or
 associations other than those tied to UPRONA are currently
 permitted. Following the August 1988 ethnic violence, a
 nationwide ban on public assemblies of more than five persons
 was in effect for 2 1/2 months. The widespread public protest
 against the Government's rules for the secondary school
 entrance examinations was initiated by an unauthorized march
 by over 1000 Hutu and Tutsi university students. The
 Government did not interfere with their march, and there were
 no instances of participating students being arrested or
 harassed subsequently. The Government permits nonpolitical
 private associations but requires that they be registered and
 accorded legal recognition before they may function.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 The Buyoya Government reversed the repression of religious
 expression under the previous regime of Colonel Jean-Baptiste
 Bagaza. Buyoya has freed religious prisoners, reopened the
 closed churches, returned confiscated church properties,
 including houses and schools, authorized workday religious
 services, reinstituted the activities of the catechists, and
 authorized church schools (including seminaries and literacy
 and catechism classes), publications, and radio broadcasts.
 Most missionaries who were expelled are being allowed to
 return, and there are no restrictions on new missionaries for
 authorized churches.
 The Catholic Church in particular, plays an important role in
 the development of the country and in the lives of both rural
 and urban Burundis. A visit by Pope John Paul II in September
 underlined the dramatic changes in church-state relations
 under the Buyoya regime.
 Religious organizations are subject to the same rules and
 restrictions that apply to secular organizations. All
 religious associations must obtain approval from the
 Government to operate in Burundi, and a Burundi citizen must
 be designated as legal representative of each association.
 The approval process, which includes an investigation of the
 association's activities in its home country, can be lengthy,
 though the Government has announced that the law governing
 registration, which dates from 1959, will be revised to
 simplify and speed up decisions. Recognition has been
 restored to the Seventh-Day Adventist church, which was banned
 under the Bagaza regime, and has been granted to several other
 religious organizations that applied since the Buyoya
 Government came to power.
 Other groups have applications for legal status that are
 currently under review. Among them are the Jehovah's
 Witnesses, who were banned under the Bagaza regime. A visit
 by an international delegation of Witnesses in June 1990 to
 examine a pattern of arrests and harassment of church members
 
 
 37
 BURUNDI
 by local government officials resolved some issues, but the
 Government still had not granted the group legal status at the
 end of the year, allegedly because of Witnesses' refusal to
 acknowledge secular authority.
 Religious groups may not engage in political activity critical
 to the Government. There are no barriers to the maintenance
 of links with coreligionists in other countries.
 Participation in religious life does not exclude membership in
 the UPRONA or eligibility for social benefits.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 The Government has not instituted nationwide restrictions on
 internal travel since the aftermath of the August 1988 ethnic
 violence. Since that time, localized travel restrictions have
 occasionally been enforced in areas experiencing unrest. The
 most recent example occurred in areas of Makamba province in
 southern Burundi following the August 13 armed attack on a
 local infantry camp.
 The Government's policy is to discourage urban migration
 through rural development programs and a public education
 campaign. A voluntary resettlement program exists to promote
 migration from densely populated areas to parts of the country
 where more land is available.
 Foreign travel and emigration are relatively free. In
 February the Government abolished the requirement that Burundi
 citizens who travel abroad must surrender their passports to
 the immigration office on their return to Burundi. Citizens
 are not required to have passports for journeys to neighboring
 areas of Rwanda and Zaire. Foreigners residing in Burundi
 must have passports and exit visas to leave the country.
 All but approximately 1,000 of the more than 50,000 Burundi
 citizens who fled to southern'Rwanda following the August 1988
 ethnic violence have returned voluntarily to their homes and
 resumed their normal activities. At year's end the United
 Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) was seeking
 permanent homes for those who refused to return to other areas
 of Rwanda and in Zaire.
 The official estimate of Burundi's refugee population is
 267,500, most of whom are Rwandan Tutsis who have resided in
 Burundi since the 1960's. The Government works closely with
 the UNHCR in refugee matters and does not generally force
 resettlement. However, a group of approximately 100 Somalis
 who arrived in Burundi in late 1989 were refused asylum and
 placed under house detention. In 1990 the majority of these
 Somali were persuaded to depart voluntarily, were resettled in
 other countries, including the United States or were deported.
 The Government is working with the UNHCR to resettle five
 special Rwandan refugees in third countries. The resettlement
 is part of an agreement with the Rwanda Government that the
 two countries each expel five particular refugees from the
 other country for political activities incompatible with their
 refugee status. The Government occasionally repatriates
 Rwandans and Zairians who lack residence permits or who have
 been arrested on suspicion of criminal activities. At
 present, Burundi citizenship can only be acquired through
 birth to Burundi parents; howeVer, a new citizenship law that
 would allow naturalization is under study.
 
 
 BURUNDI
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 As of the end of 1990, citizens did not have the legal right
 to change their government through democratic procedures.
 Power continues to be wielded by President Buyoya and the
 UPRONA. In May President Buyoya announced a timetable for
 political reforms in keeping with the recommendations of the
 National Unity Commission. As a first step, a national
 congress convened in late December, at which time the ruling
 Military Committee for National Salvation was dissolved and
 replaced by an interim UPRONA Central Committee.
 A constitutional commission is to be convened in early 1991,
 after the expected adoption of the National Unity Charter,
 with the declared mandate of designing permanent civilian
 governmental institutions. In his announcement, President
 Buyoya called for the commission to work in close consultation
 with the people and to consider, inter alia, the establishment
 of a multiparty system.
 Political participation currently takes place only within the
 one-party structure, and voters can express dissatisfaction
 only by voting against incumbents for party positions. The
 party is open to all Burundi citizens supporting its
 principles. Both men and women are active members and
 officeholders. The UPRONA, together with its youth, women's,
 and labor affiliates, claims a membership of approximately 1.4
 million persons, over three-quarters of the adult population.
 However, many registered party members are inactive.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 At the end of 1990, two local groups have applications pending
 before the Government for recognition as human rights
 organizations. The Government allows international and
 nongovernmental organizations to investigate human rights
 conditions in Burundi. After initially rejecting calls for an
 international investigation into the August 1988 ethnic
 violence, it allowed an extensive survey of conditions in the
 affected areas by local U.N. representatives. An Amnesty
 International delegation visited Burundi in June 1989,
 primarily to investigate the status of the detainees arrested
 in the aftermath of the violence. The ICRC, which established
 a local office in Bujumbura in June, was allowed to visit all
 prisons and other detention facilities in 1990.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Historically, the minority Tutsi have dominated the majority
 Hutu people. Serious civil strife resulting in thousands of
 deaths has erupted between the two groups several times in the
 modern era, most recently in April 1972 and August 1988. In
 both instances, Hutus accounted for a large majority of the
 victims. Following the 1988 ethnic violence, the Government,
 with the support of the international community, moved rapidly
 to restore ethnic confidence, including the appointment of a
 National Unity Commission to recommend fundamental ethnic
 reforms.
 De facto discrimination by Tutsis against Hutus remains in
 many areas of society, although it is not condoned by law.
 
 
 BURUNDI
 There are few Hutus in the army, and the majority of civil
 service jobs, as well as university positions, go to Tutsis.
 As a result of President Buyoya's ethnic reform efforts, Hutus
 have made substantial inroads into the civil service, and the
 number of Hutus now exceeds the number of Tutsis entering
 secondary school. The pace of integration in the military
 remains slow, although some progress was made in 1989 and
 1990. Tutsis dominate the modern economic sector, while in
 rural areas economic opportunities are roughly equivalent for
 both ethnic groups.
 The status of women, who hold a secondary position in Burundi
 society, is evolving slowly from traditional patterns. The
 suspended constitution provided for legal equality, and this
 continues to be respected in practice. The current legal code
 prohibits polygamy and a dowry requirement, allows women some
 control over family matters, and provides for land inheritance
 by women. However, there are legal restrictions that pertain
 to women in several areas, including the provision that a
 married woman cannot start a business without her husband's-
 permission. Fewer women than men obtain a formal education;
 however, once a degree is attained, women can generally find
 suitable employment. The Government has not discriminated
 against women in hiring, and the civil service pay scale makes
 no distinction between men and women. Women are not
 significantly represented in business, the professions, or at
 higher levels of government, although the situation has
 improved in recent years.
 Violence against women, especially wife beating, is known to
 take place, but as there are no studies available, the extent
 of the violence is difficult to quantify. While police do not
 normally intervene in domestic disputes, severe cases are
 dealt with by the legal system. The Government officially
 discourages violence against women and addresses the problem
 largely through the Burundi Women's Union, which provides
 counseling and, when deemed necessary, referral to legal
 authorities.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Workers do not have the right of association as defined by the
 International Labor Organization (ILO), and Burundi is
 signatory neither to ILO Convention 87 on freedom of
 association nor to Convention 98 on the right to organize and
 collective bargaining. The UPRONA controls the National Trade
 Union Confederation (UTB) and has institutionalized this
 single trade union structure by means of legislation. No
 other unions are allowed by law. While the UTB's constitution
 calls for election of all officeholders by the full
 membership, its present leadership was appointed by President
 Buyoya. New leadership is to be elected at a national
 conference planned for 1991. The principal role of the UTB is
 to serve as an intermediary between workers and employers in
 labor matters. Labor policy in Burundi is formulated by the
 National Labor Council, on which employers, the UTB, and the
 Ministry of Labor are represented. The Council debates labor
 issues and makes policy recommendations to the Government.
 Strikes are permitted only if authorized by the Ministry of
 Labor after negotiations have failed, and advocacy of an
 unauthorized strike or lockout is a criminal offense. The one
 strike repored in 1990, among ship crews on Lake Tanganyika,
 
 
 BURUNDI
 was not approved by the Government, but no sanctions were
 imposed on the strikers. Public sector employees are not
 allowed to strike. The UTB is affiliated with the
 Organization of African Trade Union Unity.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 Workers do not have the right to organize outside the UTB.
 Collective bargaining is supervised by the Government. There
 are no limits to the issues which can be bargained between the
 UTB and the empoyers. However, the two sides are bound by
 wage and working conditions guidelines established by the
 National Labor Council and approved by the Government.
 To resolve labor disputes outside of collective bargaining
 situations, a three-step process is employed: Direct
 employer-employee negotiations under the auspices of the UTB;
 an administrative hearing before a government labor inspector;
 and a legal proceeding before the Labor Court (or an
 administrative court, in the case of public employees), in
 which the UTB represents the employee (whether a union member
 or not). The UTB is often successful in forcing employers to
 change their practices through this process. The UTB
 estimates that between 80,000 and 100,000 workers,
 approximately 50 percent of the country's wage-earning
 employees, are union members. Antiunion discrimination is
 prohibited by law and is not a problem in practice because of
 the protections provided to employees under the Labor Code.
 There are no export processing zones in Burundi, and labor
 laws are applied uniformly throughout the country.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Forced or compulsory labor is prohibited by law and is not
 practiced. Burundi has ratified ILO Conventions 29 and 105
 which deal with forced labor. The ILO's Committee of Experts
 (COE) reiterated in 1990 that various legislative provisions
 which call for imprisonment and an obligation to work as
 punishment for expressions of political views contrary to
 those of the party are not in compliance with Convention 105.
 The COE noted the Government's stated intention to review the
 offending legislation and to bring it into conformity with the
 Convention. The COE also noted that provisions of ordinances
 concerning land usage are in violation of ILO convention 29.
 The UTB states that while many prisoners do agricultural or
 artisanal work to help feed themselves, there is no compulsory
 convict labor in Burundi.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 In the modern, urban sector of the economy, children under the
 age of 16 may not be employed in any capacity. Enforcement of
 this minimum age by inspectors from the Ministry of Labor is
 limited. However, as a practical matter in this poor, largely
 rural country, many children are obliged by custom and
 circumstance to help their families in subsistence agriculture.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 Over 90 percent of the population of Burundi is engaged in
 subsistence agriculture. Minimum labor standards are
 established by the National Labor Council and promulgated by
 the Government in the Labor Code, but these standards have
 relevance primarily for workers in the small wage sector of
 
 
 41
 BURUNDI
 the economy. The established minimum wage rate is the
 equivalent of $1 per day in the cities of Bujumbura and
 Gitega, and $0.87 per day in smaller towns and rural areas.
 This wage level is inadequate to provide a decent living for
 urban families, who frequently supplement their income through
 family gardening or petty commerce. Wages are higher in the
 few private sector businesses and in skilled jobs. The
 maximum workweek is fixed by law at 45 hours. Saturday
 afternoons, Sundays, and holidays are times of rest, and civil
 servants are allowed one afternoon per week for organized
 athletic activities. In the modern economic sector, minimum
 health and safety standards are incorporated in the Labor Code
 and are monitored by the Ministry of Labor. The enforcement
 of these standards is limited due to a lack of resources, such
 as safety inspectors.
