 BURMA
 Since gaining independence in 1948, Burma has been at war
 continuously with communist and various ethnic insurgents
 including narcotics traffickers who have denied the govern-
 ment effective presence in some areas of the country and
 have regularly employed violence to advance their political
 or commercial objectives. For nearly two-thirds of this
 period, Burma has been governed by the authoritarian hand
 of General and now President Ne Win. Seizing power by
 military coup in 1962 after a period of political instability,
 the Ne Win government jailed without trial persons believed
 to threaten the revolutionary government or the socialist
 system and others who were considered supporters of regional
 separatism. All but a very few of these persons were released
 by the early 1970's. In recent years the government has
 continued to make political arrests when it perceived threats
 to security or to public order.
 The Constitution of 1974, drafted at Ne Win's behest, gives
 the government of the Socialist Republic of the Union of
 Burma its present form: a one-party system of parallel
 government and party structures with a state-run economy,
 responsive in the final analysis to the President. It is
 not, however, a communist state. The Burmese system is a
 meld of socialism, Burmese nationalism and Buddhist social
 concerns.
 In a notable display of international responsibility, the
 Burmese Government in 1978-79 cooperated fully with the
 U.N. and the Government of Bangladesh in the repatriation
 of nearly 175,000 ethnic Bengali Muslims to areas where
 they had resided in Burma's Arakan State. The exodus of
 this group to Bangladesh in the spring of 1978 was pre-
 cipitated by a nationwide government crackdown on illegal
 immigrants and rumors of threatened deportation for illegal
 Bengali immigrants.
 An improving economic situation, the warming of relations
 with China and the confinement of insurgencies to the border
 areas have given the government more confidence in its own
 security resulting in a gradual relaxation of some government
 restrictions. Evidence for this exists in the recent
 increase of visiting Burmese expatriates and the expansion
 of areas open to tourist travel. The very absence this year
 of demonstrations and government arrests, provoked in past
 years by food shortages, indicates the government's growing
 confidence and Burma's improved economic condition in the
 wake of =he 1978-79 bumper rice crop. Reported instances of
 abuse of basic human rights have diminished as the government's
 confidence has grown. In the economic sphere the government
 has pursued an effective policy of redistributing wealth.
 As a result, most Burmese receive about the same very low
 income.
 1.   Respect for Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 There have been reports that the GUB has used (particularly
 in 1974-75) and still uses physical and psychological co-
 ercion during interrogation in cases concerning national
 security, major organized crimes (including narcotics
 trafficking) and serious political opposition. Attempts
 to verify these reports have been difficult.
 (431)
 
 
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 At least in part because of the general low standard of
 living in Burma, conditions in Burmese prisons are relatively
 poor and overcrowded with limited diets and medical attention.
 Political prisoners appear to receive preferential treatment.
 Aside from the use of force in the interrogations already
 noted, we are unable to confirm any intentional pattern of
 cruel, degrading or discriminatory treatment or punishment.
 Amnesty International reported in February 1979 five death
 sentences meted out by the Rangoon court. The Department
 of State, however, is aware of no summary executions during
 the past year and of only two death sentences (two convicted
 narcotics smugglers). We do not know if they have been
 carried out.
 c. Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 The exact number of political prisoners is uncertain, but
 believed by observers to be between 150 and 250. Many are
 held on criminal charges for inciting violence or graft.
 The Government neither acknowledges holding political
 prisoners nor feels compelled to justify detention or
 imprisonment of any individual or class of individuals.
 A 1975 Anti-Subversion Law permits indefinite detention.
 Many political detainees eventually are tried on criminal
 charges; others are held or released without trial.
 Although prisoners are sometimes held incommunicado,
 the Department of State knows of no recent instances of
 persons being held secretly or having disappeared for
 protracted periods. The Department of State is aware
 of no recent attempts to hide arrests from family members
 and friends.
 d. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The 1974 Constitution provides for public trial and judicial
 access. The burden of proof is on the prosecution and the
 accused has the right to an attorney. Justice is administered
 by a system of People's Courts with the right to appeal to
 higher levels (culminating in the National Council of People's
 Justices). The judges frequently are lay persons untrained
 in law who are selected by the Party.  They are advised
 by professional legal officers, usually former judges under
 the British-developed system. The advice of these legal
 officers may or may not be accepted. In addition to codified
 law, traditional Burmese notions of community harmony, fair
 play and socialist concepts are among the factors which
 affect court decisions.
 In practice, lawyers are generally able to consult with
 their clients freely and in private. Defendants and their
 lawyers are generally aware of the charges and evidence
 against them, and are permitted to submit their own evidence.
 It is not unusual for the defendant's brief to appear in the
 state-controlled newspapers.
 In some sensitive cases with political overtones, judgment
 and sentences are probably influenced by the Government.
 In areas of high government priority such as anti-narcotics
 efforts, the severity of sentences also at times appears to
 reflect judicial awareness of Government concerns. As
 noted above, persons held under the Anti-Subversion Law
 may or may not be tried.

 e. Invasion of the Home
 The 1974 Constitution guarantees the privacy and security of
 the home, but it has been abridged in practice, especially
 during public disturbances, situations involving insurgent
 activity, and other suspected threats to national security.
 Local government officials also enforce movement control
 measures by periodic searches of suspected residences
 without warrant, often after midnight, to verify occupants.
 2.   Government Policies Relating to the Fulfillment of
 Such Vital Human Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care
 and Education
 Burma is one of the world's poorest countries in terms of
 reported per capita annual income. The present Government
 is committed to traditional Burmese and socialist concepts
 of economic and social justice which have resulted in a
 general leveling of incomes throughout society. While the
 Government has effected a substantial redistribution of
 wealth with the average Burmese sharing a very low income,
 policies to improve living conditions have not been very
 effective. The Burmese military and political elite live
 modestly, although better than the average citizen.
 Although the government takes stern and swift action on
 cases of major corruption, the overall low standard of
 living presents a continual temptation for corruption.
 Further, the semi-legal status of a widespread "shadow
 economy" has an unquantifiable but corrosive effect on
 official morality.
 Burma's population is among the most literate in Asia.
 Education is free through the university level.
 Access beyond secondary school is controlled by
 examinations and extra school fees are required.
 Health care is generally available, although lack of re-
 sources limits its effectiveness in both the large cities
 and in rural areas.
 Adequate shelter is a problem primarily in larger cities,
 where an influx of people from the countryside overtaxes
 available shelter and occasionally produces squatters.
 The right to own property is respected by law, although
 under the Constitution the State retains residual rights
 to the disposition of land.
 3.   Respect for Civil and Political Liberties Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 Freedom of expression is limited in Burma. Public criticism
 of the leadership is not tolerated, nor is political assembly
 or organizing outside of government-sponsored mass and party
 organizations. All media are government-owned and controlled.
 Journalists are subject to strict guidelines as to what
 can be broadcast or published, especially on political
 matters. Contacts between government employees and foreigners
 are limited and may be controlled. Secular popular organi-
 zations not approved or sponsored by the Government are
 banned (including labor unions). Party-sponsored workers'
 and peasants' organizations, youth leagues, and similar
 organizations provide some opportunity for ordinary
 citizens to express themselves politically, but serve
 
 
 434
 primarily as the means for communicating national policies,
 implementing government programs, and enlisting popular
 support for government programs. Government policy inhibits
 public assembly of large groups for political purposes.
 Freedom of religion, guaranteed in the 1974 Constitution,
 is widely observed in Burma, a largely Buddhist country
 with sizeable Christian, Muslim and animist minorities.
 The Government has nationalized certain past secular functions
 of religious organizations (education and medical care), but
 these measures applied to all religions equally. There does
 not appear to be any religious discrimination per se in
 Burma, although ethnic differences sometimes overlap with
 religious differences and ethnic tensions do exist.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel and Emigration
 The 1974 Constitution guarantees the right of Burmese
 citizens to live anywhere in Burma. Exceptions apply
 to military areas or broad areas of insurgent activity.
 Both citizen and non-citizen residents of Burma (primarily
 Indian or Chinese, many of whom were born in Burma) are
 subject to travel restrictions and controls and must obtain
 permission to travel and to stay outside the township of
 their residence.
 Foreign travel is difficult, except for officials and
 to implement official programs. Emigration is permitted,
 although bureaucratic and legal requirements are formidable
 and the Government must be reimbursed for university and
 professional education received.
 This past year appears to have brought a relaxation of
 policies which hitherto virtually prohibited the return
 of Burmese-born emigres and greatly restricted the temporary
 non-official travel abroad of private Burmese. A number of
 Burmese expatriates returned to visit relatives and friends,
 some for lengthy periods. Local Buddhist, Christian and
 Muslim religious leaders were permitted to travel abroad
 for conferences and religious work.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 The Burmese Government is an authoritarian one-party
 military system with the leadership drawn largely from the
 officer corps of the military services. The one party is
 the Burma Socialist Programme Party (BSPP). No other
 secular political groupings are permitted.
 Burma has universal suffrage, although in both national
 and local elections there is only one slate of candidates
 chosen by the Party. The Party does, however, sometimes
 consider, nominate and elect non-Party members. The Party
 mechanism provides for modest political participation for
 an individual, as well as for nominal and limited self
 criticism of bureaucratic failings. Public criticisms of
 the BSPP policies or personnel are discouraged.
 Participation in the BSPP is theoretically open to all adult
 citizens who satisfy candidacy requirements. Less than 5%
 of the adult population, however, are full party members.
 Party membership is virtually a prerequisite for many
 government jobs.
 
 
 435
 As a socialist country, the Party-sponsored and government-
 controlled basic workers' and peasants' associations are
 intended to replace trade unions. These organizations
 mediate employee complaints against private employers but
 appear to be ineffectual against the Government, the major
 employer in Burma. Strikes are rare, and strikers risk
 loss of job at the minimum.
 Burmese women are generally treated on a equal basis
 with men. Only in the political arena are women under-
 represented, reflecting in part the quasi-military
 character of the Government. They have equal status
 under the law and inherit equally with men. Women share
 equally in education, enter the professions, and engage
 in economic activity.
 There are hundreds of thousands of Burmese residents who are
 probably not Burmese citizens. Those who hold foreign
 citizenship and proper documentation are eligible for
 registration as permanent resident aliens. However,
 aliens other than those with permanent resident status or
 valid visas are subject to deportation. Burma does not
 treat resident aliens equally with citizens. While alien
 children can receive primary and secondary education, they
 are not eligible to attend state universities. Among other
 things, travel is restricted and aliens are not eligible to
 become members of government-operated consumers' cooperatives.
 They are thereby ineligible to buy less expensive food
 staples and certain other basic commidities. The Government
 is in the process of drafting a new citizenship law, which
 may enable various alien residents to adopt Burmese
 citizenship.
 In March/April 1978 the fear of deportation and inter-
 ethnic conflict stimulated the flight of approximately
 175,000 ethnic Bengali Muslims from two townships in
 northwestern Arakan to Bangladesh. Following negotiations,
 Burma has cooperated fully with the UN and the Government
 of Bangladesh in repatriating and resettling the emigres
 in their former home areas of Burma. The program has now
 been completed to the satisfaction of the U.N. and the
 Government of Bangladesh.
 There is a considerable, although unknown number of
 residents of Burma who do not have Burmese citizenship
 and cannot obtain official recognition in the form of
 travel documentation from other states. Unlike other
 foreigners, they are not able to emigrate. Burma does
 not recognize a UN travel document for this purpose.
 4.   Government Attitude and Record Regarding Inter-
 national and Non-Governmental Investigation of
 Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 There was apparently no response to Amnesty International's
 cables to President Ne Win concerning the exodus of ethnic
 Bengali Muslims to Bangladesh in 1978. However, the rapid
 response of the Burmese Government in facilitating the
 ethnic Bengalis' return presumes some official concern
 for its image abroad.
