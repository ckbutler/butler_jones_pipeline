 FEDERATED STATES OF MICRONESIA
 The Federated States of Micronesia (FSM) is a nation of 607
 isldfids, mostly uninhabited, extending over 1 million square
 miles of ocean in the Central Pacific. Four states, Pohnpei,
 Truk, Yap, and Kosrae, comprise the federation. The four
 states were formerly part of the Trust Territory of the
 Pacific Islands, administered by the United States from 1947
 to 1986 pursuant to an agreement with the United Nations. In
 November 1986, the FSM emerged as a sovereign, self-governing
 nation under the Compact of Free Association with the United
 States. The population, of Micronesian origin, is estimated
 to exceed 100,000.
 Political legitimacy rests on the popular will expressed by a
 majority vote in accordance with the Constitution, which is
 based in large part on the U.S. model. There are three
 branches of government: a president as chief executive and
 head of state, a unicameral legislature elected from the four
 constituent states, and a judicial system which applies
 criminal and civil laws and procedures closely paralleling
 those in the United States. Under the Compact of Free
 Association, the United States is responsible for defense and
 national security. Consequently, the FSM has no security
 forces of its own aside from local police and other law
 enforcement officers, both of which are firmly under the
 control of the civil authorities. The economy depends heavily
 on transfer payments from the United States, fishing, tourism,
 and subsistence agriculture.
 No human rights abuses were reported in 1989.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 No political killings occurred.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no disappearances or abductions.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 There were no reports of these practices.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest; Detention, or Exile
 Legal procedure follows U.S. law in its provisions for due
 process. These provisions are carefully observed. There is
 no exile.
 With regard to forced or compulsory labor, see Section 6.c.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Public trial is provided for in the Bill of Rights, and trials
 are conducted fairly. Juveniles may have closed hearings.
 The Chief Justice, currently a U.S. citizen, is appointed by
 the President.

 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The law prohibits such arbitrary interference, and in practice
 there is none.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 These rights are constitutionally assured and faithfully
 observed. Each of the four state governments controls a radio
 station, broadcasting primarily in the local language. Yap
 also controls a small television station. The Federal
 Government and the governors, of Kosrae and Truk publish
 newsletters. Several private and municipal newsletters in
 Truk and Pohnpei, however, do not hesitate to challenge
 governmental policies. Religious groups operate private radio
 stations in Pohnpei and Truk, and a commercial television
 station broadcasts 12 hours a day on Pohnpei. Nongovernmental
 media are expanding, albeit slowly.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 These rights are also provided for in the Bill of Rights.
 During political campaigns, citizens often take advantage of
 them to question candidates at public meetings. Formal
 associations are uncommon in Micronesia. Nevertheless,
 student organizations and at least one lobbying group exist.
 For a discussion of freedom of association as it applies to
 labor unions, see Section 6.a.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 The Federated States is extremely hospitable to diverse
 religions, and missionaries of many faiths work within the
 nation. The Bill of Rights forbids establishment of a state
 religion and governmental restrictions on freedom of
 religion. Most of the citizens are Christians.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 There are no restrictions in any of these areas. The Compact
 of Free,Association permits citizens to travel to, reside in,
 and work in the United States without having to obtain
 immigrant visas.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 The Congress is elected by popular vote from each state;
 Congress then chooses the President and Vice President from
 its ranks by majority vote. State governors, state
 legislators, and municipal governments are all elected by
 direct popular vote. Elections are conducted honestly, and
 political campaigning is unrestricted. Although there are no
 restrictions on the formation of political groups, to date
 there have been no efforts to form political parties.

 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 No violations have ever been alleged, nor are there any known
 requests for investigations. There are no local groups that
 concern themselves with human rights. The Federated States
 does not belong to the United Nations.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 The Constitution provides explicit protection against
 discrimination based on race, sex, language, or religion. The
 various traditional cultures establish hierarchies of social
 status, and these traditional rankings can influence access to
 political office and education, even though such access is in
 principle open to all. Traditional culture is greatly
 respected by the peoples of the Federated States, and is
 protected by Article V of the Constitution. Although the
 traditional social orders are losing ground as westernization
 takes a greater hold upon young people, male dominance is a
 fact of life throughout Micronesia. Women are still at the
 early stages of finding jobs beyond the entry level, in both
 the public and private sectors. Allegations of violence
 against women are almost exclusively concerned with domestic
 conflict between husband and wife. Assault is a criminal
 offense, but in such cases wives are very reluctant to bring
 formal charges against their husbands. Local support groups
 are beginning to hold meetings in some of the state capitals
 to publicize domestic issues, including alcohol and drug
 abuse. These meetings serve to create a greater awareness of
 social problems, including the rights of all citizens.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 National government employees have the right, by law, to form
 associations to "present their views" to the Government. The
 Constitution states that "no law may deny or impair freedom of
 expression, peaceable assembly, association, or petition."
 These limits are observed by the Congress. There are as yet,
 however, no trade unions in this largely nonindustrial society.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 There is no law dealing specifically with trade unions or with
 the right to collective bargaining. There are no special
 economic areas set aside, and labor standards and practices
 are the same throughout the islands.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 The Constitution specifically prohibits involuntary servitude,
 and there is no evidence of its practice.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 There is no law establishing a minimum age for employment of
 children.

 .e.... Acceptable Conditions of Work
 The. minimum wage for national R6vernment employees is $1.50
 per hour. -While there is no legally established minimum wage
 for other-types of employment, wages for unskilled workers
 vary from $0.-80 to..$1.50 'pe hour- under current customs and
 practices- Thefie wages are sufficient to provide an acceptable
 standard of living under local conditions. There are no laws
 regulating hours of .wrk or prescribing standards of
 occupational safety and health, but a federal regulation
 requires that employers provide a safe place of employment.
