 INDONESIA
 Indonesia's authoritarian political system came under sustained challenge during
 1998, resulting in President Soeharto's departure from office and opening an oppor-
 tunity for meaningful political and economic reforms. The ultimate result of this re-
 form effort remains unclear. Two months after his reelection to a seventh 5-year
 term in March, popular pressure forced Soeharto to resign in favor of his hand-
 picked Vice President, B.J. Habibie. The new President immediately announced a
 series of steps to address domestic and international human rights concerns. With
 many citizens questioning his legitimacy because of his close association with
 Soeharto, President Habibie formed a cabinet that drew heavily on holdovers from
 the last Soeharto Cabinet. In response to demands for early elections, Habibie
 pledged to advance parliamentary elections by 3 years, to hold them under fun-
 damentally revised electoral laws, and to complete selection of a new president by
 the end of 1999. The Government allowed new political parties to form and adopted
 a more responsive attitude toward groups demanding improved protections for
 human rights. The economic crisis generated friction among social and ethnic
 groups, and the state ideology of "Pancasila," which stresses consultation and con-
 sensus, was not used as blatantly as in the past to limit dissent and enforce social
 and political cohesion. The judiciary remained subordinated to the executive and
 suffers from pervasive corruption.
 The armed forces have broad nonmilitary powers under a "dual function" concept
 that accords them a political and social role in government. The primary mission
 of the 450,000-member armed forces, which includes 175,000 police, is maintenance
 of internal security and stability. In the more open post-Soeharto climate, the dual
 function doctrine came under challenge from student and other social groups. In the
 absence of effective institutional safeguards, and despite some improvement over the
 course of the year, the military and police continued to commit numerous serious
 human rights abuses.
 The country's severe economic crisis led to massive unemployment, food shortages,
 and a significant drop in living standards, as well as a rise in crime, looting, and
 other symptoms of social breakdown. Widespread corruption remained a problem.
 Major unrest spurred demands both for the Government to act more effectively to
 address social and economic inequities and to curb disorders. In rural areas, dis-
 
 
 904
 content often focused on the grievances of small landowners, especially those forced
 off their land by powerful economic and military interests. In some regions, exploi-
 tation of natural resources entailed significant environmental degradation with ad-
 verse social consequences.
 The Government continued to commit serious human rights abuses. Its perform-
 ance improved after the resignation of President Soeharto, when it endorsed broad-
 ened press freedom, released numerous political prisoners, signed or ratified impor-
 tant human rights and labor conventions, and security forces more frequently exer-
 cised restraint in responding to demonstrations. In addition, it faced mounting pub-
 hc pressure to strengthen protections for human, labor, and civil rights. Security
 forces continued to commit extrajudicial killings throughout the year, including of
 unarmed civilians, in particular in East Timor and Irian Jaya. Security forces shot
 and killed four unarmed students participating in a peaceful demonstration at
 Trisakti University on May 12. Two police officers were sentenced to short jail terms
 for not following orders, although they were not charged with these killings. Many
 viewed them as scapegoats, since evidence indicated that other military units were
 responsible. Security forces also fired upon and killed protestors during November
 demonstrations. The abduction of political and human rights activists was a serious
 problem through May. During Soeharto's final year in office, at least 20 such activ-
 ists disappeared. The armed forces in August acknowledged responsibility for ille-
 gally kidnaping nine activists who already had been released, several of whom said
 that they were tortured while in detention. At least 12 activists remained missing
 as of year's end. Punishments short of criminal sanction were imposed on three
 high-ranking officers in connection with these kidnapings, and the court martial of
 11 other lower ranking military personnel began in December. Security forces con-
 tinued to torture, abuse, and otherwise mistreat persons. The Parliament ratified
 the Convention against Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment
 or Punishment in July, but legal protections against torture are still inadequate.
 During massive riots in mid-May, mobs targeted the ethnic Chinese community,
 which was not protected by the authorities. Following the riots, allegations of mass
 rape of ethnic Chinese women were made, forcing the Government to establish a
 fact-finding team to investigate the riots and rapes. The team found that elements
 of the military had been involved in the riots, some of which were deliberately pro-
 voked. It also verified 66 rapes of women, the majority of whom were Sino-Indo-
 nesian, as well as numerous other acts of violence against women. The armed forces
 publicly acknowledged several areas of past human rights violations and launched
 stil ongoing investigations into some of the worst violations. Security forces contin-
 ued to use arbitrary arrest and detention. The judiciary is pervaded by corruption,
 and remains subordinated to the executive branch. Security forces regularly violated
 citizens' right to privacy. Prison conditions remained harsh.
 The Government's limits on freedom of speech and the press loosened considerably
 during the first 5 months of the year. Prior to Soeharto's resignation, public criti-
 cism of the-Government intensified and received broad coverage in the press. The
 media also carried regular reports of calls for political and economic reform and for
 Soeharto to step down. Following Soeharto's resignation, press freedom expanded
 significantly but still lacks institutionalized protections. The Government continued
 to impose significant limitations on freedom of assembly and association during the
 first 5 months of the year. Although students generally were permitted to dem-
 onstrate on campus during this period, security forces frequently used force to pre-
 vent them from taking protests off campus and occasionally entered the campuses
 and beat student demonstrators. In the period prior to the March presidential elec-
 tion, security authorities broke up numerous protests, including peaceful demonstra-
 tions, leading to the arrest, trial, and conviction of activists. Many demonstrations
 took place during the second half of the year by students and others without inter-
 ference from security forces. However, throughout the year, there were numerous
 instances where security forces reacted harshly in dealing with demonstrations or
 in disputes with citizens, leading in many cases to injury, and in some cases to the
 killing of demonstrators. For much of the year, security forces generally refrained
 from using lethal force in responding to major riots; however, they frequently were
 criticized for not acting in time to protect citizens and property from the large-scale
 destruction that occurred. Numerous demonstrations occurred following Soeharto's
 resignation, and the new Government in July issued a controversial decree restrict-
 ing demonstrations. The Government bowed to popular pressure by rescinding the
 decree in August. A new law on freedom of expression passed by the legislature in
 October required 3-days' advance notice to police of demonstrations and contained
 other provisions governing the conduct of demonstrations. It was enforced unevenly.
 The Government legally provides for religious freedom for five designated reli-
 gions; unrecognized religions are subject to restrictions. Attacks against minority
 
 
 905
 houses of worship continued, and the lack of an effective government response to
 punish perpetrators and prevent further attacks led to allegations of official complic-
 ity in some of the incidents. Attacks on mosques also occurred. The Government to
 a limited extent continued to restrict freedom of movement. Domestic human rights
 organizations played a significant and increased role in advocating improved human
 rights conditions; some nongovernmental organizations (NGO's) reported monitoring
 and interference by the authorities. Discrimination against women, the disabled,
 and ethnic minorities, and violence against women are endemic problems. Child
 abuse and child prostitution are problems, and female genital mutilation (FGM) per-
 sists in some areas. Interreligious violence and violence against ethnic minorities
 also were a problems.
 The Government took several positive steps in regard to worker rights, although
 enforcement of labor standards remained weak. The military and police continued
 to intervene in labor disputes, canceled union meetings, intimidated workers, and
 beat and injured union demonstrators. At least one worker died as a result of such
 injuries. Economic pressures forced a significant number of children out of school
 and likely increased the number of children working. Millions of children work,
 often under poor conditions. Forced and bonded labor, including by children, re-
 mains a problem. Some children forced to work under conditions of bonded labor re-
 portedly suffer abuse. However, despite worsening conditions for workers due to the
 economic crisis, the Government took several positive steps in regard to worker
 rights. The Government released the country's best known labor leader from deten-
 tion and withdrew all charges against him. The Government also ratified Inter-
 national Labor Organization (ILO) Convention 87 on freedom of association, allowed
 new and previously unrecognized independent trade unions to operate, and post-
 poned implementation of a controversial manpower law to permit revision and pub-
 lic consultation.
 With the demise of the Soeharto regime, United Nations-sponsored Portuguese-
 Indonesian talks on East Timor gained new momentum, as the two sides agreed to
 discuss an Indonesian plan to offer special status for East Timor, which went well
 beyond what had been considered by the previous government. However, as of year's
 end, negotiators had not bridged the gap between the Government's insistence on
 autonomy as a final solution, and the Portuguese/East Timorese resistance demand
 for an eventual vote on self-determination. In East Timor itself, there were increas-
 ing expressions of popular opposition to the Government, and proreferendum forces
 began to operate more openly. A surge of support for independence following
 Soeharto's resignation caused tensions to rise sharply and precipitated the tem-
 porary departure of several thousand non-East Timorese government officials and
 others, reportedly concerned about their security. Serious human rights abuses con-
 tinued despite a relatively low level of insurgent activity. Extrajudicial killings rose
 sharply, with confirmed reports of 37 killings in the first 8 months of the year.
 Credible sources attributed the great majority of these incidents to the military, in
 the final months of the year, military and police personnel, along with civilians seen
 as collaborators were the victims of a series of attacks and killings. Insurgents were
 accused in these cases, although it is unclear who is responsible. Military crack-
 downs that followed were accompanied by serious human rights abuses. As in past
 years, disappearances, torture, and excessive use of force on the part of the authori-
 ties continued. Following the May events, there was a more open atmosphere in
 East Timor, with increased tolerance for freedoms of assembly, expression, and the
 ress. A June visit by a troika of European ambassadors, and a December visit by
 .N. Special Envoy Jamsheed Marker, were greeted with large proreferendum dem-
 onstrations. The Habibie Government released 56 East Timorese political prisoners,
 but resistance leader Xanana Gusmao remained in prison despite international calls
 that he be freed. No progress was made in accounting for persons missing following
 the 1991 Dili incident, or of others who disappeared in recent years. While the mili-
 tary carried out a highly publicized withdrawal of some 1,000 troops, there did not
 appear to be an overall reduction in the unjustifiably high number of troops in East
 Timor, and some evidence pointed to an increase. The Government granted in-
 creased access to the area to foreign journalists but continued to ban travel by for-
 eign human rights nongovernmental organizations (NGO's) except for the Inter-
 national Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC). In July a respected East Timorese was
 appointed director of the previously dormant East Timor branch of the National
 Commission on Human Rights, which had opened in 1996. While in most cases
 those responsible for extrajudicial killings went unpunished, the military authorities
 prosecuted a soldier who had killed a civilian.
 In Irian Jaya, resentment among indigenous groups against the Government led
 to angry demonstrations for independence in five cities between July 1 and July 7.
 Security forces responded harshly,_killing one person in Jayapura, one in Sorong,
 
 
 906
 and a still undetermined number in Biak. Demonstrators beat a plainclothes police-
 man to death in Jayapura, and injured security personnel in other cities. The Par-
 liament, the National Human Rights Commission, the Council of Churches, and a
 consortium of NGO's all conducted investigations of human rights violations in Irian
 Jaya. An investigation by a group of Irianese churches and the National Human
 Rights Commission confirmned earlier reports of 11 extrajudicial killings by security
 forces in the central highlands of Irian Jaya and is continuing its investigation into
 reports that security forces killed another 43 persons in 1997. On October 1, the
 Government announced a less stringent security status for Irian Jaya.
 Serious human rights abuses in Aceh continued through May. However, tensions
 remained high for the rest of the year despite the reduction in abuses and resulted
 in several clashes between Acehnese and military personnel, seven of whom were
 killed following their abduction in December.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-Historically, politically related
 extrajudicial killings have occurred most frequently in areas where separatist move-
 ments were active, such as East Timor, Aceh, and Irian Jaya, and security forces
 continued to employ harsh measures against separatist movements in these areas.
 In addition to killings committed in these three officially designated "troubled
 areas," security forces killed unarmed student demonstrators, and there were also
 numerous instances of reported extrajudicial killings by security forces in cases in-
 volving alleged common criminal activity.
 Security forces beat four bystanders while breaking up a large student demonstra-
 tion in Yogyarkarta on May 9. One of the victims died from the beating. Security
 forces shot and killed four unarmed students who were participating in a large,
 peaceful demonstration at Jakarta's Trisakti University on May 12. Security forces
 and students there engaged in a brief confrontation, which was resolved through ne-
 gotiation. However, when the students began returning to campus, four were shot
 and killed. Anger over the killings helped cause the rioting that took place in Ja-
 karta May 13-14. On November 13, security forces fired on and beat student and
 nonstudent demonstrators at Atma Jaya University. At least nine demonstrators
 were killed, and one member of the security forces was killed when beaten by dem-
 onstrators (see Section 1.c.). Four progovernment demonstrators were also killed in
 a separate incident on November 13, when they were beaten to death by civilians.
 The Human Rights Commission established a team at the end of November to in-
 vestigate the November 13 incident. The armed forces earlier had announced on No-
 vember 22 that they would take legal action against some personnel who had been
 involved in beating journalists on November 12 and in shooting demonstrators on
 November 13, when nine (mostly student) demonstrators died. Over 100 Army Stra-
 tegic Reserve Command (KOSTRAD) and Jakarta Area Command (KODAM JAYA)
 soldiers were disciplined after the incident, mostly for discharging their weapons
 (with rubber bullets) without permission and use of excessive force against dem-
 onstrators. Based on the severity of the violation, soldiers were given one of three
 levels of punishment: 21-days' detention, 10-days' detention, or extra duty/confine-
 ment to barracks. No further legal action was taken, and no one was held account-
 able for the deaths of the demonstrators.
 Credible sources confirmed some 37 extrajudicial killings in East Timor in the
 first 8 months of the year. In a case under investigation by the National Human
 Rights Commission, military personnel killed four East Timorese civilians in Janu-
 ary in the Bobonaro area. Special forces troops killed a herdsman near Venilale in
 February. In April an East Timorese woman and her two children were killed when
 military forces assaulted her house in Baucau. In another attack on a house in
 Baucau, two East Timorese men were  led in May. Also in May, military personnel
 reportedly killed Costodio da Silva Nunes when he ran from them near Liquica. In
 June Herman das Doares Soares was shot in the back by military forces near
 Manatuto while gathering wood and died on his way to the hospital. One soldier
 was found guilty of murder in the incident and sentenced to 10 years' imprisonment.
 Also in June, a stray bullet apparently killed Manuel Marques Soares when security
 forces fired at a crowd of protesters in Manatuto. In late June, security forces killed
 Orlando Marcelino da Costa when they fired into a crowd demonstrating during the
 visit of the European troika ambassadors to Baucau. In August security forces fa-
 tally shot a civilian in Bobonaro, East Timor, in what the local office of the National
 Human Rights Commission called a retaliation killing following an earlier alterca-
 tion. In a November military operation in the Alas area, security forces killed at
 leas six persons.
 
 
 907
 In Irian Jaya, a group of Irianese churches issued a report in May that charged
 the military with responsibility for the extrajudicial killing of 11 persons in the
 south central highlands of Irian Jaya during a military operation aimed at captur-
 ing separatists who kidnaped and later killed 2 members of a group of researchers
 in January 1996. The National Human Rights Commission subsequently confirmed
 the killings and is continuing an investigation into 43 other deaths that the church
 commission said were cause by the military. The Council of Churches is continuing
 an investigation into the reported shooting deaths of an undetermined number of
 persons after security forces forcefully broke up a large demonstration in favor of
 independence for Irian Jaya in Biak on July 6.
 In Aceh there were credible reports of mass graves and killings carried out by se-
 curity forces in the past and into 1998. The National Human Rights Commission
 and a parliamentary delegation carried out investigations of mass graves,
 extrajudicial killings, disappearances, rape, and torture that took place in Aceh dur-
 ing 1989-91 and 1997-98. The National Human Rights Commission visited Aceh in
 August and issued a preliminary report that estimated that there were hundreds
 of instances of killings, disappearances, and torture. Following the Commission's re-
 port, the provincial government authorized a series of fact-finding teams composed
 of community workers, NGO staff, journalists, retired military personnel, and others
 to conduct more thorough investigations into human rights abuses in the three
 hardest hit districts in the province. In December the governor of Aceh announced
 the teams' findings: In three provincial districts, between 1989 and mid-1998, 1,021
 Acehnese were killed, 864 disappeared and remain missing, 357 were disabled,
 1,376 women were widowed, 4,521 children were "orphaned" ( lost at least 1 parent),
 and 681 houses were burned. There are also credible allegations that hundreds of
 Acehnese women were raped during the 9-year military operation. Reports of dis-
 appearances and other serious human rights abuses continued until May. Between
 24 and 34 Acehnese reportedly were abducted in the period from December 1997
 to May and remain unaccounted for. The armed forces commander visited Aceh in
 August and apologized for "excesses" committed by the military in the province; he
 promised to withdraw all combat units not normally based there, a promise that
 was subsequently carried out. However, troop levels were increased sharply again
 in December in response to rising tensions and clashes between civilians and the
 military. Tensions between the military and the local population in the province re-
 main high, as reflected by rioting in Lhoksumawe in late August and early Septem-
 ber. During the Lhoksumawe rioting, one local resident was killed and eight others
 were injured by gunfire in confrontations with security forces. Through the end of
 the year sporadic civil disturbances and instances of violence occurred in the dis-
 tricts of North Aceh, East Aceh, and Pidie and two more persons were kidnaped and
 possibly killed.
 International human rights organizations reported that three Acehnese refugees
 deported by Malaysia and suspected of separatist activity by the Indonesian Govern-
 ment were tortured as they were being transported back to Indonesia by Indonesian
 authorities. According to the reports, the three were chained to inner tubes and
 dragged across the Strait of Malacca behind the Indonesian vessel that was trans-
 porting them. One of the three reportedly died.
 The police often employed deadly force in apprehending suspects or coping with
 alleged criminals, many of whom were unarmed. In response to protests that the
 methods used were unjustifiably harsh and amounted to execution without trial, po-
 lice generally claimed that the suspects were fleeing, resisting arrest, or threatening
 the police. Complete statistics about the number of these cases have not been re-
 leased. A police spokesman in Jakarta told the press that police had shot a sus-
 pected drug dealer in February when he resisted arrest by pulling a knife and ignor-
 ing warning shots. According to a press report, the victim died from a shot to the
 head.
 In the past, higher authorities rarely punished the military or police for using ex-
 cessive force. The armed forces' investigation into the Trisakti shootings implicated
 18 police officers, 2 of whom had been court-martialed as of September. Lawyers for
 the defendants charged that their clients were wrongly accused. The prosecution
 had indicated that the police fired rubber bullets, but the defense and others con-
 tended that the students had been killed by live ammunition. The National Human
 Rights Commission in a May 27 statement indicated that it was not able to meet
 with a number of witnesses to the shootings because they had been "threatened by
 an unidentified person." It also reported that it had obtained evidence that the po-
 lice had not used live ammunition. Other evidence appeared to implicate military
 units in the shootings. On August 12, the two police officers who were court-
 martialed in the case were convicted by a military tribunal of disobeying or exceed-
 ing orders by ordering their subordinates to shoot into the crowd of demonstrating
 
 
 908
 students. The two were sentenced to imprisonment, one for 10 months and the other
 for 4 months. Trials in the cases of the other 16 defendants had not yet begun as
 of year's end. The government-established joint fact-finding team on the May riots
 and rapes in its November 3 report urged authorities to speed up the judicial proc-
 ess related to the Trisakti case, and called for further investigations in order to re-
 veal the full story surrounding this incident. It also concluded that the Trisakti
 shootings triggered the May 13-15 rioting.
 There were no developments in the five cases of alleged human rights violations
 in Irian Jaya involving the death of Irianese civilians, which were cited in a 1995
 report by the National Human Rights Commission.
 Police resumed the investigation of the 1993 murder of labor activist Marsinah,
 questioning old and new witnesses, after NGO's and labor groups called for a fresh
 effort to solve the case. In September 1997, police had announced a "temporary sus-
 pension" in the investigation.
 Vigilantes apparently killed three suspected informants in Aceh in late October
 and early November. In late December, seven off-duty soldiers were killed by a mob
 in a village in East Aceh, prompting dozens of arrests by security forces and the
 deployment of at least 700 troops from outside the province.
 In East Timor during the first half of the year, at least six security personnel and
 East Timorese civilians accused of collaborating with the Government were killed.
 During the final months of the year, there was also a pattern of attacks and killings
 directed against military and police personnel and civilians seen as collaborators.
 Insurgents were accused in these cases although it was often unclear who was re-
 sponsible. Personal grudges or other motives, rather than political grounds, may
 have been the cause of    killings in some cases. In November residents of Alas,
 possibly accompanied by guerrillas, attacked a local military post and killed three
 soldiers.
 In several areas, especially East Java; suspected practitioners of black magic as
 well as some religious leaders associated with a moderate Muslim organization,
 Nahdlatul Ulama, were killed by unidentified persons or mobs. There were close to
 200 such attacks during the year. Associates of the victims criticized the lack of po-
 lice or military response and said that the attacks were politically motivated. Few
 of the perpetrators were caught; in some cases, angry mobs killed suspects detained
 by the police.
 b. Disappearance.-Reports of disappearances continued until May. Security
 forces admitted to involvement in the abduction and disappearances of nine student
 and human rights activists, who were subsequently released. Several of these
 credibly reported that they were tortured while in custody and that other abducted
 activists, who remain missing, were held in the same facility. According to credible
 local human rights monitors, the confirmed disappearances occurred in three
 phases: Near the time of the May 1997 election, in the 2 months prior to the March
 People's Consultative Assembly (MPR) session, and in the period just before
 Soeharto's May 21 resignation. By May, nine of those kidnaped in the second phase
 were released from captivity and had "reappeared." They were Pius Lustrilanang,
 Desmon Mahesa, Haryanto Taslam, Faisol Reza, Rahardjo Waluyo Djati, Nezal
 Patria, Mugianto, Aan Rusdianto, and Andi Arief. Several spoke out publicly about
 their experiences. None of those abducted in the first and third phases had re-
 appeared as of December.
 Pius Lustrilanang, chairman of the People's Alliance for Democracy (ALDERA),
 testified before the National Commission on Human Rights on April 27 about his
 ordeal. According to his statement, on February 4 while waiting for public transpor-
 tation he was kidnaped in Jakarta by an armed man who shoved him into a car.
 He was handcuffed and blindfolded, and taken to an unidentified place where he
 was questioned and tortured (see Section l.c.). He was held with other kidnaped ac-
 tivists in a facility with six cells. Prior to his April 2 release, he was threatened
 with death if he spoke of his experience. He never saw the kidnapers during his
 2 months of captivity. Desmon Mahesa, the chairman of a local legal aide group,
 LBH Nusantara, and a member of ALDERA, on May 12 gave a public statement
 about his experience. He reported that on February 3 he was on his way to a meet-
 ing and was approached by two men armed with pistols who beat him. He was
 pulled into a car and a bag was put over his head. He was taken to a room where
 he was interrogated and tortured (see Section 1.c.). He was held in the same facility
 as Pius Lustrilanang. Mahesa was released on April 3 at the Jakarta airport.
 Rahardjo Waluyo Djati, from the National Committee for Democratic Struggle pub-
 licly spoke on June 4 about his March 12 abduction. He was taken to an unidenti-
 fied location where he was interrogated and, for the first 3 days, tortured (see Sec-
 tion 1.c.). The kidnapers transferred him to the police on April 17. Faizal Reza
 spoke publicly on June 26 about his experience. He said that while waiting for pub-
 
 
 -lic transportation he was abducted and thrown into a car and blindfolded. He was
 taken to a large building in Jakarta and tortured (see Section 1.c.). Andi Arief, the
 head of the student wing of the People's Democratic Party (PRD), on July 21 pub-
 licly spoke about his March 28 kidnaping from Lampung, South Sumatra and subse-
 quent interrogation. He said that he had been held captive for almost 3 weeks in
 Jakarta along with other political activists, and then he was turned over to the po-
 lice who held him until he was released on July 15.
 Four more of the persons who disappeared also resurfaced, including Indonesian
 Democratic Party (PDI) official Haryanto Taslam and students Nezar Patria,
 Mugianto, and Aan Rusdianto.
 Local human rights monitors listed 12 missing persons as of year's end, and there
 are fears that some or all may have been killed by their abductors. A member of
 the National Human Rights Commission at the end of August called on the armed
 forces to explain to the public the status of the missing and to find them, alive or
 dead.
 Six of the persons still missing are believed to have disappeared in Jakarta in
 1997 near the time of the general election. They are: M. Yusuf, Yani Avri, Sonny,
 Noval Alkatiri, Deddy Hamdum, and Ismail. Two of the six disappeared during the
 period prior to the March MPR session, but-unlike the nine other persons who dis-
 appeared during that period and who were released-they have not reappeared.
 They are: Suyat, who disappeared in Solo, and Herman Hendrawan, who dis-
 appeared in Jakarta. Four persons disappeared after the MPR session, most on May
 14 in Jakarta. They are: Bimo Petrus, Ucok Munandar Siahaan, Hendra Hambalie,
 and Yadin Muhididn. An activist and street singer living in Solo was reported miss-
 ing in May. He was found dead in East Java on May 23. There were suspicions that
 he had been killed because of his political activities, like some other kidnap victims,
 he was a member of the PRD.
 The National Human Rights Commission issued a statement on April 30, which
 reported that a "well organized group" had carried out the disappearances of the
 student and NGO activists, and concluded that there were strong indications that
 "elements" of the security forces were involved. Prior to that, Defense Minister/
 Armed Forces Commander General Wiranto had said that there was no order for
 armed forces personnel to kidnap persons and that the armed forces would help find
 those who were missing. On June 29, Wiranto revealed that the armed forces had
 identified several of their personnel who were "allegedly involved" in the kidnaping
 of activists and who "exceeded their authority." He added that the armed forces
 were working with the National Human Rights Commission and a local NGO in
 their investigation. On July 3, the armed forces revealed that their internal inves-
 tigation had concluded that special forces personnel were involved in the disappear-
 ances but claimed that this resulted from "procedural errors" and excesses in viola-
 tion of the law. Twenty soldiers had been questioned. On July 14, the military police
 announced that several special forces officers had been detained. The military police
 chief said that special forces members were involved in the kidnapings of eight ac-
 tivists who had already been released, plus one more (Andi Arief) who would soon
 be released. On August 3, Wiranto announced that an officers' honor council had
 been formed to question senior officers about the kidnaping and torture of activists.
 It would   question  Lieutenant   General Prabowo, Major     General Muchdi
 Purwopranjono, and Colonel Chairawan (former commander of "Group 4" within the
 special forces).
 Despite admitting his involvement in the abduction of the nine activists who re-
 appeared, General Prabowo was discharged honorably from the military, and as of
 year's end no legal action had been taken against him. Prabowo took no responsibil-
 ity for the remaining activists who were still missing. The government-established
 joint fact-finding team, in its November 3 report on the May riots and rapes, urged
 that Lt. General Prabowo and all those involved in the abductions be brought before
 a military tribunal. It also stated that the judicial proceedings surrounding the dis-
 appearance cases should be speeded up. The other two officers investigated by the
 honor council were removed from active service. After being detained in July, 11 of-
 ficers (none higher than major) and noncommissioned officers from the special forces
 went on trial on December 23 for their alleged involvement in the abductions of the
 nine student and NGO activists who already had been released. The torture that
 the detainees reported was not addressed in the trial, and it was asserted that these
 military personnel had acted on their own initiative without orders from above.
 Moreover, the trial has not addressed the possible killing of one abductee and the
 fact that at least 12 others still are missing.
 There were numerous reports of disappearances in East Timor. In most, but not
 all, cases the missing persons turned out to have been detained without notification
 
 
 to their families. Credible sources reported that two persons taken into military cus-
 tody in November in the Alas area subsequently disappeared.
 The Indonesian Council of Churches' investigation of the security forces' forceful
 breakup of a July demonstration in Biak, Irian Jaya, revealed the existence of 51
 "mysterious" bodies. Some of the bodies showed signs of having drifted from the site
 of a tidal wave in Papua New Guinea, but others were clearly Irianese. A related
 investigation by a consortium of Irianese churches and NGO's listed 11 persons as
 missing following the incident.
 The National Human Rights Commission continued to list 16 persons missing
 from the government-backed violent takeover of PDI headquarters on July 27, 1996.
 On August 12, it issued a statement that noted that the Commission's October 1996
 recommendations regarding the July 27 incident had not received a full response
 from the Government.
 Also in August, the National Human Rights Commission issued a preliminary re-
 port that found that 163 persons had disappeared in Aceh during 1989-91 and
 1997-98. In October the fact finding team (see Section L.a.) reported that there had
 been 475 disappearances in North Aceh between 1989 and 1998.
 There were no significant efforts by the Government to account for the missing
 and dead from the November 12, 1991, military shooting of civilians in Dill. No ad-
 ditional cases were resolved during the year. Knowledgeable observers continued to
 believe that most of the persons missing are dead and that members of the armed
 forces know where their bodies are located.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Criminal Code makes it a crime punishable by up to 4 years in prison for any
 official to use violence or force to elicit a confession. In practice, however, legal pro-
 tections are both inadequate and widely ignored, and security forces continued to
 employ torture and other forms of mistreatment, particularly in regions where there
 were active security concerns, such as Irian Jaya and East Timor. Police often resort
 to physical abuse, even in minor incidents.
 The Parliament in July approved a bill ratifying the Convention Against Torture
 and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.
 Several of the student and human rights activists kidnaped by the security forces
 (see Section 1.b.) testified publicly that they had been tortured during interrogation.
 The military court that convened in December to try 11 special forces personnel for
 the kidnappings did not take up charges of torture. General Prabowo, the son-in-
 law of former President Soeharto, who was in charge of the elite special forces at
 the time, admitted to a military honor board that he was responsible for these and
 several other abductions (see Section l.b.).
 Pius Lustrilanang testified publicly before the Indonesian National Commission
 on Human Rights on April 27 that his captors used electric wires attached to his
 feet to shock him as they asked him questions about the activities of various opposi-
 tion figures. They also submerged his head in water so that he could not breathe
 and kicked and hit him. The torture and interrogation continued for the first 3 days
 of his captivity but not afterward. Desmon Mahesa said publicly on May 12, that
 on the first day of his captivity  he had been tortured while asked questions about
 his political activities. His captors covered his eyes and handcuffed him to a chair.
 They applied electric shocks to his feet and head, and beat and kicked him. They
 forced him to immerse his head in water so that he could not breathe. Rahardjo
 Waluyo Djati on June 4 publicly recounted how he, too, had been beaten and sub-
 jected to electric shocks during his captivity. His kidnapers also made him lie on
 a block of ice. Faizol Reza testified on June 26 that during his captivity he had been
 subjected to a variety of abuse and torture, including beatings, the application of
 electricity to various parts of his body, burning by cigarettes, and sleep deprivation.
 He was asked questions mainly about his role in the People's Democratic Party
 (PRD).
 A credible local human rights monitor reported that five people from Garut, West
 Java claimed to have been tortured in February when they were being held without
 a warrant by local military forces. They said that they had been stripped, slapped,
 kicked, choked, pistol whipped, immersed in water, abused verbally, forced to swal-
 low bullets, and had their hair pulled.
 Twelve students questioned in May regarding the death of a police officer in Bogor
 were beaten by security forces and not permitted legal counsel during their ques-
 tioning, according to local human rights monitors. Three of the students were ac-
 cused in the death of the police officer, who allegedly was killed by a stone when
 he tried to intervene to help a colleague who was under attack by students. A foren-
 sic expert later publicly stated that the police officer had died of a heart attack rath-
 er than a blow to the head implying that the officer had not been attacked by stu-
 dents.
 
 
 In August a preliminary report by the National Human Rights Commission (see
 Section l.a.) found that 368 persons had been tortured in Aceh during 1989-91 and
 1997-98. In October a fact-finding team reported 1,010 incidents of torture in North
 Aceh between 1989 and 1998 (see Section L.a.).
 In East Timor, military units and civilian paramilitary forces regularly detain ci-
 vilians for interrogation; most are held in extralegal military detention centers,
 often with no notification of relatives, mistreated for several days, and then re-
 leased. Family members and human rights mohitoring organizations often encoun-
 ter difficulties in identifying and visiting detainees held in these military facilities.
 Many credible sources agreed that persons detained by the police in East Timor are
 beaten routinely while in the process of being detained. Following the fall of the
 Soeharto government in May, there were indications that security forces in East
 Timor were being more careful in their handling of detainees, and local human
 rights monitoring organizations reported that complaints of serious abuses had de-
 creased. However, in November and December security forces' abuse of the civilian
 population during operations in the Alas and Bobonaro areas following attacks on
 security personnel in those locales was widespread.
 In February security forces in Aceh detained a 7-month-old baby, Muhammad
 Ardiansyah, of Morong village, along with his mother Ainsyah. Ainsyah alleged that
 her captors suspended her baby by his legs and left him in the sun for several hours
 in order to force her to reveal the whereabouts of her husband, who they suspected
 of separatist activity. Ainsyah and her child later were released. In March
 Acehinese separatist Ishaq Dawood was handed over to Indonesian authorities in
 Malaysia and according to an international human rights organization was one of
 three accused separatists who were chained to inner tubes and dragged across the
 Strait of Malacca (see Section L.a.).
 There were instances where security forces responded with brutality to peaceful
 demonstrations, although they more frequently excercised restraint in the post-
 Soeharto era. On August 25, a group of 750 workers from a textile factory in Central
 Java, consisting mostly of young women, tried to march from a local human rights
 organization in Jakarta where the workers were holding a free speech forum to the
 local office of the ILO. When security forces attempted to push them off the street,
 a shoving match ensued, and security forces beat the demonstrators with rattan
 canes and kicked them until they retreated. As many as 19 demonstrators were in-
 jured. On June 12, approximately 400 security force personnel violently broke up
 a peaceful demonstration by East Timorese protesters at the Foreign Ministry in Ja-
 karta. Upon being confronted and blocked by security forces, many demonstrators
 tried to break though the line of security forces and were beaten with batons and
 kicked. Some of the 180 persons arrested following the July 6 shooting of dem-
 onstrators in Biak reportedly were beaten in detention. Some shot in the course of
 the arrest were not afforded medical attention for many hours. On September 11,
 in Jakarta, security forces beat with rattan canes numerous Irianese among a group
 of approximately 40 demonstrators attempting to demonstrate near the Ministry of
 Defense and Security.
 Although authorities allowed hundreds of student demonstrations to take place on
 campus between January and May, in numerous cases security forces violently
 stopped students from attempting to move their protests off campus. One example
 occurred in Central Java on May 8, when thousands of students and local residents
 gathered at a local university to participate in a demonstration calling for lower
 prices, political and economic reform, and Soeharto's resignation. When they tried
 to march off campus, security forces drove them back using rattan canes. When the
 demonstrators responded by throwing stones and Molotov cocktails, the police used
 tear gas, water cannons, and rubber bullets. Negotiations failed to halt the protest
 and police again attacked demonstrators with rattan canes, severely injuring hun-
 dreds.
 On March 19, 400 to 500 security force personnel blocked the entry gate at
 Lampung University, preventing a student demonstration of 2,000 to 3,000 partici-
 pants from moving to another campus, according to a local human rights monitor.
 Either students or provocateurs threw rocks at the security forces, and the security
 forces responded by throwing rocks back. Security forces entered the campus, fired
 warning shots and tear gas, and dragged students into the street and beat them.
 Many students and several police were injured. On April 8, 1,000 to 2,000 students
 at Surabaya's Airlangga University were pushed back when they tried to leave cam-
 pus by security forces using water cannon. Students responded by throwing stones
 at the security forces, and, when it appeared that security forces would attempt to
 enter the campus, the students laid down in front of advancing water cannon. Sev-
 enteen students reportedly were injured in the clash.
 
 
 Student demonstrations intensified again in the months leading up to the mid-
 November special session of the People's Consultative Assembly (MPR). Unlike the
 pre-May period, most demonstrations occurred off-campus. Security forces permitted
 a great many of the street demonstrations to occur and in many cases did not resort
 to violence. However, there were numerous cases where security forces violently dis-
 persed demonstrations, and several resulted in fatalities to students and a few secu-
 rity forces personnel (see Section l.a.). For example, on September 8, security forces
 broke up a student demonstration at the Parliament. They injured several students,
 including two who reportedly were stabbed with combat knives. This incident ap-
 pears not to have been investigated, and no one has been held accountable. On Sep-
 tember 14, a group of students attempted to stage a demonstration in front of the
 Defense Ministry, but they were beaten by security forces as they attempted to get
 out of their buses and were forced to retreat.
 The period surrounding the November MPR session was especially violent. It was
 complicated by the decision of government and military authorities to organize thou-
 sands of civilians, many of them armed with sharpened bamboo sticks and other
 crude, but dangerous weapons, to assist in providing security for the MPR session.
 On November 10, the opening day of the MPR, thousands of student demonstrators
 and hundreds of progovernment counterdemonstrators took to Jakarta's streets. Al-
 though a tense standoff ensued, violence was limited mostly to stone throwing.
 On November 11, demonstrators and security forces cooperated through much of
 the day to avoid violence and confrontation. However, during a standoff that ensued
 after students were stopped by security forces as they attempted to march to the
 parliament building where the MPR was taking place, one student's car went out
 of control and careened into security personnel, injuring nine security officers. Secu-
 rity forces reportedly assaulted three journalists on the scene as well as two female
 students-
 On November 12, the situation became more violent when security forces used
 water canon, tear gas, and batons to disperse a crowd that had gathered outside
 the Parliament to protest against the MPR. During a separate altercation also on
 November 12, security forces fired upon students who were trying to break through
 security lines and reach the Parliament.
 On November 13, the violence peaked when over.a 10-hour period security forces
 fired on and beat students who were part of a demonstration at Atma Jaya Univer-
 sity, whose campus is located less than 2 miles from the parliament building where
 the MPR was being held. At least nine demonstrators, mostly students, died of gun-
 shot wounds and severe beatings. One member of the security forces died as a result
 of a beating by demonstrators and several other security force members were in-
 jured and were hospitalized. Hundreds of student and nonstudent demonstrators
 were hospitalized, many with gunshot wounds, presumably caused by rubber bul-
 lets. Live ammunition accounted for the injuries of most of those demonstrators who
 were killed. Four journalists also were injured including one who was shot. A mem-
 ber of the security forces approached this journalist and shot him at very close
 range with rubber bullets, wounding him in the kidney area (see Section l.a.). In
 a separate incident on November 13, four progovernment demonstrators were also
 killed when they were beaten to death by civilians.
 Following the November MPR session, students continued to demonstrate, but
 mostly in smaller groups. Several demonstrations ended violently. On December 19,
 security forces injured up to 17 student protestors after they refused to stop a dem-
 onstration near President Habibie's residence. A police official referred to the re-
 cently passed law on demonstrations that requires 3-days advance notice of a dem-
 onstration (see Section 2.b.). The official was quoted as saying that "we had the
 right to disperse them." Thirty-three demonstrators were detained. Another clash
 between students and security force occurred on December 17 near the Parliament.
 Students had reacted with violence when ordered to disperse by the security forces,
 and the security forces responded in kind. Up to 80 students and 14 members of
 the security forces reportedly were injured.
 In May violent unrest erupted in Jakarta and other cities. It included massive
 looting and burning, especially of commercial areas, and the ethnic Chinese commu-
 nity was a particular target of the violence. The National Human Rights Commis-
 sion issued a statement on June 2, in which it concluded that the security apparatus
 did not take action to stop the unrest from spreading and failed to take sufficient
 preventive action to stop it from beginning. According to government sources, 499
 people died during the unrest, many of them purportedly looters who became
 trapped in stores that were being burned. However, the National Human Rights
 Commission, stated in its June 2 statement that it had received a report listing
 1,188 deaths and 101 persons injured.
 
 
 Local human rights monitors charged that between May and early July, 168
 women were the victims of rape or sexual abuse, 152 from Jakarta and 16 in Solo,
 Medan, Palembang, and Surabaya. In a July 8 statement, the National Human
 Rights Commission found that during the rioting that took place May 12-14 and
 afterward in Jakarta and other cities it had been "unequivocally ascertained" that
 "widespread and repeated rape of a particularly inhumane nature occurred, per-
 petrated by brutal gangs successively in Jakarta and other cities." It was carried
 out in a "systematic manner" and focused on ethnic Chinese women and girls. The
 Commission noted in particular that some rapes occurred in front of the families
 of victims. The Commission found that there was a uniform "modus operandi" in
 the way that the rapes were carried out. It stated that the security vacuum during
 the initial days of the unrest indicated the neglect of state responsibility, which
 could have permitted the sexual violence to occur.
 Two months after the May unrest, the Government established a joint fact-finding
 team to investigate the May riots and rapes. It was made up of representatives of
 the military, the National Human Rights Commission, other government agencies,
 and NGO's, and the vice chairman of the National Human Rights Commission was
 elected as its chairman. It was given 32 months to complete its work. However,
 after its establishment, military and police officials began questioning publicly
 whether rapes had taken place or whether the reports had been exaggerated, and
 threatened prosecution of anyone who made exaggerated claims. Team members
 complained that these threats impeded their investigation by intimidating witnesses
 and victims.
 On November 3, the joint fact-finding team issued its report on the May riots and
 rapes. The report concluded that there had been 52 rapes, 14 rapes accompanied
 by other violence, 10 instances of sexual attacks, and 4 instances of sexual harass-
 ment in Jakarta, Medan, and Surabaya in connection with the May riots. The ma-
 jority of the victims were Sino-Indonesian women. It also concluded that sexual vio-
 lence had occurred before and after the May riots and that the May 13-15 riots
 were a culmination of a series of violent events, such as the Trisakti shootings and
 the disappearances. Moreover, according to the team's report, while some of the riot-
 ing was local, sporadic, limited, and spontaneous, it was "assumed" that other riots
 were created as part of an "elite political struggle." Many different parties report-
 edly were involved, including local hoodlums, mass organizations, and elements of
 the armed forces. The team criticized the armed forces for failing to take preventive
 action or steps to stop the riots once they began. The team also found that it was
 not yet clear whether the sexual violence was premeditated or an excess of the riot-
 ing, but it charged that the riots were part of an effort to create an emergency situa-
 tion that would allow authorities to assume extraconstitutional powers and that the
 highest level of decisionmakers had been involved in planning the violence. It called
 on the Government to conduct further investigation into the root causes of the riots
 and to investigate a meeting at KOSTRAD headquarters on May 14 that involved
 Lt. General Prabowo and other parties. Following a meeting between President
 Habibie and government representatives of the joint fact-finding team in late De-
 cember, the Government accepted the findings on the numbers of rapes but by
 year's end had left many of the other issues raised in the report unanswered.
 The Government continued to maintain an unjustifiably high military presence in
 East Timor, totaling more than 16,000 personnel. In July the Government made a
 highly publicized withdrawal of some 1,000 troops from East Timor, but there did
 not appear to be an overall reduction in troop levels; some unconfirmed but credible
 information indicated that troop levels actually significantly higher than -the Gov-
 ernment had stated. The Government, as it does elsewhere, also relied on bands of
 youths, organized and directed by the military, to intimidate and harass its oppo-
 nents. Civilian paramilitary groups frequently were involved in human rights
 abuses. Human rights monitoring organizations reported that several East Timorese
 women were raped by Indonesian security or civilian personnel during the year.
 Cases of East Timorese women allegedly raped by soldiers in previous years re-
 mained unresolved.
 Prison conditions are harsh with violence among prisoners and mistreatment and
 extortion of inmates by guards common. The incidence of mistreatment drops sharp-
 ly once a prisoner is transferred from police or military intelligence (BIA) custody
 into the civilian prison system or into the custody of the Attorney General. Credible
 sources report that criminal prisoners in some facilities are beaten routinely and
 systematically as punishment for infractions of prison discipline and to extract infor-
 mation about developments within the prison. Punishments include use of electric
 shock batons and stapling of the ears, nose, and lips. Political prisoners sometimes
 were mixed with the general prison population. Political prisoners in the Cipinang,
 Salemba, and other prisons tend to be segregated from the criminal population and
 
 
 914
 generally receive more humane treatment. In East Timor, some 83 prisoners in Dili
 reportedly suffered severe food poisoning in June and dozens were hospitalized.
 Special arrangements for foreign dignitaries to visit some prominent political pris-
 oners sometimes were made, including allowing a foreign parliamentarian to enter
 Cipinang prison in Jakarta and visit all political prisoners there. Imprisoned East
 Timorese resistance leader Xanana Gusmao received a large number of high-level
 foreign visitors and held frequent meetings with the press. Human rights monitors
 also have visited some nonpolitical prisoners, although this appears to be permitted
 on a case-by-case basis.
 The ability of the ICRC to visit prisoners varied over the course of the year (see
 Section 4).
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Criminal Procedures Code contains
 provisions against arbitrary arrest and detention, but it lacks adequate enforcement
 mechanisms and authorities routinely violate it. The code specifies that prisoners
 have the right to notify their families and that warrants must be produced during
 an arrest except under specified conditions, such as when a suspect is caught in the
 act of committing a crime. The law also requires that families of detainees be noti-
 fied promptly. The law authorizes investigators to issue warrants to assist in their
 investigations or if sufficient evidence exists that a crime has been committed. How-
 ever, authorities sometimes made arrests without warrants.
 The law presumes defendants innocent and permits bail. They or their families
 also may challenge the legality of their arrest and detention in a pretrial hearing
 and may sue for compensation if wrongfully detained. However, it is virtually impos-
 sible for detainees to invoke this procedure, or to receive compensation after being
 released without charge. In both military and civilian courts, appeals based on
 claims of improper arrest and detention rarely, if ever, are accepted. The Criminal
 Procedures Code also contains specific limits on periods of pretrial detention and
 specifies when the courts must approve extensions, usually after 60 days. In addi-
 tion, suspects charged under the 1963 Antisubversion Law are subject to special
 procedures outside the code. These give the Attorney General the authority to hold
 a suspect for up to 1 year before trial. He may renew this 1-year period without
 limit.
 The authorities routinely approve extensions of periods of detention. In areas
 where active guerrilla movements exist, such as East Timor and Irian Jaya, there
 are many instances of persons being detained without warrants, charges, or court
 proceedings. This is also true in Aceh. Bail rarely is granted, especially in political
 cases. The authorities frequently prevent- access to defense counsel while suspects
 are being investigated and make it difficult or impossible for detainees to get legal
 assistance from voluntary legal defense organizations. Special laws on corruption,
 economic crimes, and narcotics do not come under the Criminal Code's protections.
 The Agency for Coordination of Assistance for the Consolidation of National Secu-
 rity (BAKORSTANAS) operates outside the legal code and has wide discretion to de-
 tain and interrogate persons thought to threaten national security. In November the
 Government formed a new, separate "Council for the Enforcement of Security and
 Law" headed by the President but run by the Armed Forces Commander. Made up
 of members of the Cabinet, security and intelligence officials as well as the heads
 of five religious councils, its stated mission was to control and coordinate efforts to
 resolve crises threatening national stability. It is reported to be advisory in nature,
 rather than operational.
 Security forces broke up numerous demonstrations and meetings and detained
 participants (see Sections L.a., l.c. and 2.b.).
 There are no reliable data on the number of arbitrary arrests or detentions with-
 out trial, particularly in East Timor, Irian-Jaya, and Aceh. In East- Timor, arbitrary
 detentions were a continuing problem.
 The Government does not use forced exile.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution stipulates the independence of
 the judiciary, but in practice the judiciary is subordinated to the executive and the
 military. Judges are civil servants employed by the executive branch, which controls
 their assignments, pay, and promotion. Low salaries encourage widespread corrup-
 tion. Judges are subject to considerable pressure from governmental authorities,
 which often determines the outcome of a case.
 A quadripartite judiciary of general, religious, military, and administrative courts
 exists below the Supreme Court. The right of appeal from district court to high court
 to Supreme Court exists in all four systems. The Supreme Court does not consider
 factual aspects of a case, only the lower courts' application of law. The Supreme
 Court theoretically stands coequal with the executive and legislative branches, but
 it does not have the right of judicial review over laws passed by Parliament.
 
 
 A panel of judges conducts trials at the district court level, poses questions, hears
 evidence, decides guilt or innocence, and assesses punishment. Initial judgments
 rarely are reversed in the appeals process, although sentences can be increased or
 reduced. Both the defense and the prosecution may appeal.
 Defendants have the right to confront witnesses and to produce witnesses in their
 defense. An exception is allowed in cases in which distance or expense is deemed
 excessive for transporting witnesses to court. In such cases, sworn affidavits may
 be introduced. However, the Criminal Procedures Code does not provide for wit-
 nesses' immunity or for defense power of subpoena. As a result, witnesses generally
 are unwilling to testify against the authorities. The courts commonly allow forced
 confessions and limit the presentation of defense evidence. Defendants do not have
 the right to remain silent and can be compelled to testify against themselves.
 The Criminal Procedures Code gives defendants the right to an attorney from the
 moment of their arrest, but not during the prearrest investigation period, which
 may involve prolonged detention. Persons summoned to appear as witnesses in in-
 vestigations do not have the right to be assisted by lawyers even though information
 developed in the course of rendering testimony subsequently can become the basis
 of an investigation of the witness. The law requires that a lawyer be appointed in
 capital cases and those involving a prison sentence of 15 years or more. In cases
 involving potential sentences of 5 years or more, a lawyer must be appointed if the
 defendant desires an attorney and is indigent. In theory, destitute defendants may
 obtain private legal help, such as that provided by the Indonesian Legal Aid Foun-
 dation. In practice, however, defendants often are persuaded not to hire an attorney,
 or access to an attorney of their choice is impeded.
 In many cases procedural protections, including those against coerced confessions,
 particularly those coerced by the police and the BIA, are inadequate to ensure a fair
 trial. Corruption is a common feature of the legal system and the payment of bribes
 can influence prosecution, conviction, and sentencing in civil and criminal cases.
 There were few signs of judicial independence. The court continued to be used to
 take action against, or deny legal remedy to, political activists and government crit-
 ics. By the beginning of May, the Government tried, convicted, and sentenced to
 time served most of the 122 members of the "Red and White Front" who were ar-
 rested in February for holding a peaceful march. It also initiated legal action
 against three members of "The Voice of Concerned Mothers." However, the Govern-
 ment dropped charges against these three during President Habibie's first week in
 office. Ratna Surampaet and four otheropersons who had been arrested while hold-
 ing a peaceful demonstration on March 10 were tried, convicted, and sentenced to
 time served (see Section 2.b.). The Government released Muchtar Pakpahan and Sri
 Bintang Pamungkas from prison in May and subsequently ceased legal action
 against them. However, the Supreme Court proved incapable of providing redress
 for Megawati Soekarnoputri; it ruled that the Governmens transparent manipula-
 tion of the PDI leadership structure in 1996 was an internal party matter. There-
 fore, Megawati could not bring suit against government officials, only the govern-
 ment-installed PDI leadership. The trial of Loir Botor Dingit, a prominent defender
 of Dayak land rights in East Kalimantan concluded in November, when charges
 against him were dismissed. The trial involved Dingit's attempt to gain compensa-
 tion for the alleged destruction of Dayak crops and sacred sites in a 1993 logging
 operation by a timber corporation. Dingit was charged with forgery and perjury due
 to his alleged listing of some deceased individuals as those who had lost land. The
 charge ignored traditional law, which records land ownership in the name of the de-
 ceased. The trial session required 30 hours of travel from Dingit's remote home, dis-
 rupting his activities in defense of traditional land rights.
 The Antisubversion Law carries a maximum penalty of death (although this has
 not been invoked in recent years), and the law makes it a crime to engage in acts
 that could distort, undermine, or deviate from the state ideology or broad outlines
 of state policy, or that could disseminate feelings of hostility or arouse hostility, dis-
 turbances, or anxiety among the population. The excessively vague language of this
 law makes it possible to prosecute persons merely for peaceful expression of views
 contrary to those of the Government. Many prisoners are serving sentences for sub-
 version, including alleged members of the banned Communist Party of Indonesia
 (PKI), Muslim militants, and those convicted of subversion in Irian Jaya, Aceh, and
 East Timor. Other persons are serving sentences under the Hate-Sowing or Sedition
 laws. Some of these persons advocated or employed violence, but others are political
 prisoners who were convicted for attempting to exercise such universally recognized
 human rights as freedom of speech or association, or who were convicted in unfair
 trials. The MPR passed a decree at its November special session that included a
 provision calling for the revocation of the Antisubversion Law and its replacement
 
 
 with a law on national security. The Minister of Justice said publicly that the Gov-
 ernment would submit legislation in 1999 to revoke theAntisubversion Law.
 Since assuming-office, President Habibie has released political prisoners, although
 he has taken a gradual approach, and many-of the most high-profile political pris-
 oners remain in jail. Prisoners and others claim that Habibie is using prisoner re-
 leases at selected moments to curry favor with foreign governments, thus treating
 the prisoners as if they were hostages. Independent labor leader Muchtar
 Pakpahan, former Member of Parliament Sri Bintang Pamungkas, Nuku Suleiman
 (chairman of the NGO PIJAR), and Andi Syahputra, a member of the Independent
 Association of Journalists (I) were released in May. In June seven political pris-
 oners in East Timor were released, in addition to activist Coky Aritonang and eight
 East Timorese detainees. In July the Government released prisoners belonging to
 or affiliated with the PRD, 36 members of a paramilitary group who had been ar-
 rested in East Java in 1997, 2 persons who had been convicted for subversion in
 the Tasikmalaya unrest that occurred in 1996, and 2 members of AJI who were al-
 ready on probation. It also stopped legal action against Aberson Marle Sihalolo, a
 former Member of Parliament from the PDI, and Rachmad Buchori, the private sec-
 retary to a writer whose books have been banned. In August in conjunction with
 Indonesian Independence Day (August 17), the Government freed 27 more political
 prisoners, including 3 who were alleged to have had ties to the PKI, alleged separat-
 ists from East Timor (6), Aceh (9), and Irian Jaya (3), as well as 6 from Lampung
 who had been involved in a clash with government forces. Some of these releases
 came as the result of accumulated sentence remissions. The Government also set
 aside the convictions of four dissidents. On December 31, the Government freed 43
 more political prisoners and rehabilitated the citizenship and job status of 26 others
 who previously had been released. The 43 included prisoners from East Timor,
 Lampung, and Aceh.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-Judicial
 warrants for searches are required except for cases involving suspected subversion,
 economic crimes, and corruption. However, security agencies regularly made forced
 or surreptitious entries. Security forces also engaged in surveillance of persons and
 residences and selective monitoring of local and international telephone calls with-
 out legal restraint.
 Government security officials monitor the movements and activities of former
 members of the PKI and its front organizations, especially persons the Government
 believes were involved in the abortive 1965 coup. These persons and their relatives
 sometimes are subjected to surveillance, required check-ins, periodic indoctrination,
 and restrictions on travel outside their city of residence. They also are required to
 have official permission to change their place of residence. The requirement that
 "E.T." ("Ex-Tapol" or political prisoner) be stamped on the identification cards of
 these prisoners was ended officially in 1995, although in practice it continued in use
 in many cases. At least some individuals who had E.T. stamped on their identity
 cards were able to have the stamp removed. This stamp has been one of the meth-
 ods the Government has used to monitor the activities of these people, allowing the
 Government and prospective employers to identify alleged former PI1 members,
 thereby subjecting them to official and unofficial discrimination. Even when the
 stamp has been removed, these former political prisoners continue to face discrimi-
 nation and restrictions on employment.
 The Government's transmigration program moves large numbers of people from
 overpopulated areas to more isolated and less developed ones. It also is used to re-
 settie local populations within East Timor and Irian Jaya. However, plans to revive
 the program, after several years during which the Government reduced its support
 for it, fell victim to the economic crisis. The Minister of Transmigration, during the
 brief seventh   Soehart  Government, said   publicly that the Ministry    of
 Transmigration would focus its efforts in 1998 on improving conditions at existing
 transnigration sites rather than on developing new ones. The Minister also said
 that the Government would try to settle numerous disputes between transmigrants
 and local residents at scores of resettlement sites where there was disagreement be-
 tween transmigrants and local landholders over land rights and other issues.
 Human rights monitors state that the program violates the rights of indigenous peo-
 ple and dupes some transmigrants into leaving their home villages without any
 means of return. Human rights activists also have claimed that a number of those
 resettled are persons who have been forced off lands that are coveted by developers
 who have collusive arrangements with the Government and/or security forces. Con-
 ditions at some sites are life threatening with inadequate measures to protect the
 transmigrant population against diseases endemic to the sites.,Transmigrants and
 migrants outside the government transmigration program received indirect govern-
 ment support in the form of developmental assistance programs and contracts with
 
 
 917
 
 the armed forces (ABRI) or local government officials. This practice, particularly in
 East Timor, Irian Jaya, and parts of Kalimantan, led to resentment among indige-
 nous populations, whose members believed that their rights were infringed upon
 and that they were being discriminated against by virtue of the disbursement of de-
 velopment funds to those who were in some cases their newly arrived economic ri-
 vals (see Section 5).
 The Government prohibits the import of Chinese-language publications (see Sec-
 tions 2.a. and 5).
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-Although the 1945 Constitution and the 1982
 Press Law provide for freedom of the press, the Government maintained some seri-
 ous restrictions and monitoring continued; however the Government did markedly
 increase its respect for this right, especially in the latter part of the year. Freedom
 of speech improved significantly, as sensitive issues were discussed and dissenting
 opions were expressed at public demonstrations, seminars, and in statements to
 te press.
 The Government in June revoked the 1984 decree allowing the Minister of Infor-
 mation to cancel press publication licenses. The Government had used this decree
 to control the press in practice. The Government also simplified the licensing proce-
 dure for starting a publication. However, the Government issued a new decree in
 which it retained the right to suspend publishing licenses for an unspecified period
 of time, provoking objections from the Association of Indonesian Journalists (PWI)
 and the Association of Indonesian Publishers (SPS). Other means of control include
 regulation of the amount of advertising permitted and of the number of pages al-
 lowed in newspapers.
 In the first 5 months of the year, public criticism of the Government intensified,
 and the press carried it more openly. However, the Government still made attempts
 to rein in the media; in March the Government announced that it would take the
 magazine Detektif dan Romantika to court because of a cover depicting then-Presi-
 dent Soeharto as the king of spades. The magazine's editor already had been forced
 to apologize to the Government. In May then-President Soeharto publicly con-
 demned the print and electronic media for waging a "psychological war" on Indo-
 nesia in the way that it was portraying the Indonesian economy. Some journalists
 covering student demonstrations in May reportedly were subjected to intimidation
 by authorities. Two foreign journalists who were filming a May 6 clash between stu-
 dents and security authorities in Jakarta reportedly were stoned and fired upon by
 golice but escaped uninjured. A foreign journalist who was filmin security forces
 irig into a crowd in Medan was seized and threatened with a pistol.
 Following Soeharto's resignation, press freedom improved significantly, and there
 were few signs of the self-censorship that had pervaded reporting in the past, even
 on subjects known to be sensitive to the Government. Although the English-lan-
 guage press was more forward in the move toward openness, the Indonesian-lan-
 guage press was not far behind. Attempts by authorities to direct local journalists
 and editors on what they should print apparently have diminished significantly.
 President Habibie's public discussion in July of the need for journalists to obtain
 licenses, in order to insure that they were qualified professionally, raised concerns
 that the Government might try to rein in the new found press freedom. However,
 no action was taken to implement this proposal.
 The electronic media also became more open, although it remained more cautious
 in its coverage of the Government than the print media. Well before Soeharto
 stepped down, television news reports became more substantive. For example, the
 private television stations began broadcasting film footage of student demonstra-
 tions in the weeks before Soeharto resigned. Live television coverage of the May 13
 funerals of students shot at Trisakti University, and coverage afterward, of the trial
 of two of the security force personnel accused of the shootings helped focus public
 attention on this issue. The Government operates a nationwide television network
 with 12 regional stations. Private commercial television companies, most with own-
 ership by, or management ties to, the former president's family, continued to ex-
 pand. -All are required to broadcast government-produced news, but they all also
 produce news and public affairs programming independently. Journalists at a pri-
 vate television station publicly charged that the Government was using an outstand-
 ing debt held by the station as an opportunity to take over the station and control
 its new programming policy and to remove the news director who was a government
 critic. The Government rejected this argument. By year's end, the station remained
 in private hands, with the management unchanged.
 Over 600 private radio-broadcasting companies exist in addition to the Govern-
 ment's national radio network. They all were required to belong to the government-
 
 
 918
 sponsored Association of Private Radio Stations to receive a broadcasting license.
 The government radio station produces the program "National News." The new reg-
 ulations issued by the Government in June reduced the number of these govern-
 ment broadcasts that a private station must run per day from 14 to 4. These broad-
 casts are relayed throughout the country by private stations and 53 regional affili-
 ates of the government network. The new regulations allow private stations to
 produce their own news programs and many are doing so. Moreover, "talk radio"
 call-in programs regularly address political and socioeconomic issues.
 Foreign television and radio broadcasts were readily accessible. Satellite dishes
 have proliferated throughout the country, and there was access to the Internet. The
 Government made no effort to restrict access to this programming and has pro-
 claimed an "open skies" policy. Foreign periodicals are widely available, and the
 Government announced in July that the International Herald Tribune and the
 Asian Wall Street Journal would be permitted to print in Indonesia. Both subse-
 quently began publication during the year. The authorities have delayed distribu-
 tion of publications by a day or more, although this is rare. The Government re-
 stricts the import of Chinese-language publications (see Sections 1.f. and 5).
 The Government regulates access to Indonesia, particularly to certain areas of the
 country, by visiting and resident foreign correspondents. It occasionally reminds the
 latter of its prerogative to deny requests for visa extensions. Special permission is
 necessary for foreign journalists to travel to East Timor, Aceh, and Irian Jaya; the
 Government now grants increased access to East Timor to foreign journalists. The
 local press in Aceh is tightly controlled. A foreign journalist was ordered to leave
 the country in March because the journalist allegedly brought other journalists into
 a session of the MPR without permission. In November Canadian journalist John
 Stackhouse was deported shortly after his arrival in the country, reportedly because
 of articles he had writteh about East Timorin 1997.
 The Government requires a permit for the importation of foreign publications and
 videotapes, which must be reviewed by government censors. There is a significant
 amount of materials that bypasses customs and censorship procedures.
 Most books by the prominent novelist and former political prisoner Pramoedya
 Ananta Toer are banned, though some were in circulation. In May the Government
 banned a book by Soebadio Sastrosatomo for allegedly discrediting then-President
 Soeharto.
 Following the November 13 shooting of students, authorities questioned numerous
 government critics in connection with possible charges of treason; most had signed
 a statement on November 12 calling for cancellation of the special session of the
 MPR and the creation of an interim government in advance of new elections.
 While the law provides for academic freedom, constraints exist on the activities
 of scholars. There was an increase in political activity and discussions at univer-
 sities during the year.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 freedom of assembly; however, the Government places significant controls on the ex-
 ercise of this right. The Government promulgated regulations in 1995 that elimi-
 nated the permit requirements for some types of public meetings. A requirement to
 notify the police remained for most others, and in practice numerous public meet-
 ings continued to be prevented or broken up.
 In East Timor, several large demonstrations and free speech forums were held
 without government interference. East Timor related demonstrations and unprece-
 dented public discussions also took place in Jakarta. Most were peaceful, but in
 June a demonstration by East Timorese students at the Department of Foreign Af-
 fairs was dispersed with excessive force by security forces (see Section 1.c.).
 In the period prior to the March reselection of President Soeharto, security forces
 intervened to stop many meetings and peaceful demonstrations of dissidents and re-
 form advocates. In February Jakarta police warned that political protests would not
 be tolerated and that political demonstrators would be charged under an emergency
 decree from 1963 related to illegal political activity. Those arrested would face a
 maximum sentence of 5 years in prison. The national police also warned the public
 that no political activities involving large numbers of people should be held between
 February 22 and March 18, a week before and after the March 1-11 general session
 'of the MPR. In addition, although thousands of students were allowed to stage daily
 political demonstrations in the months prior to the MPR and afterward, their activi-
 ties in large part were restricted to campuses. Military and government officials
 warned students that they should confine their demonstrations to their campuses
 and explicitly instructed students not to take their protests off campus. The Edu-
 cation Minister later tried to ban demonstrations on campus, though his move was
 in practice ignored by rectors charged with enforcing the order.
 
 
 919
 In February security authorities arrested approximately 150 members of the Red
 and White Front who were conducting a peaceful march in Jakarta. Subsequently,
 122 persons were held and charged in accordance with the 1963 emergency decree
 relating to illegal political activity and sections of the Criminal Code related to re-
 fusal to move from a public place. They filed suit against the police, and the opening
 session of their trial was postponed when the police failed to release them from de-
 tention so that they could attend the hearing. Security authorities detained a dele-
 gation from the Indonesian Committee for the Global March against Child Labor fol-
 lowing the delegation's meeting with the Department of Manpower. Fourteen of the
 activists were held overnight and then released.
 Security forces arrested three of about a dozen members of The Voice of Con-
 cerned Mothers who staged a protest in the center of Jakarta against rising prices,
 especially of milk. The three persons arrested were Karlina Leksono, Indonesia's
 first female astronomer, Gadi Arivia, a university lecturer, and Wilasih Noviana.
 The police stated that the demonstration had been stopped because it was unauthor-
 ized and the three were charged under an article of the Criminal Code, which bans
 demonstrations without a permit. The three were released the following day but
 faced trial on March 4. On March 9, the court levied a small fine on the three.
 In March security forces broke up a peaceful, public meeting of activists in a
 north Jakarta park. Nine persons were arrested without a warrant, including ac-
 tress Ratna Sarumpaet, Ging Ginanjar, Adi Hermawan, Alexius S. Fathom Saulina,
 Bonar Tiro Naispospos, Aspar Paturisi, Wira Kusuma, and Joel Thaer. On March
 10, Sarumpaet and four others were sentenced to time served, 2 months and 10
 days each, for ignoring a police order to halt a meeting and were released. Also in
 March security forces broke up a small peaceful demonstration held by activists call-
 ing for the release of labor leader Muchtar Pakpahan and protesting against high
 prices. Four persons were arrested for conducting an unauthorized demonstration.
 Others were arrested from the group the night prior to the demonstration. Four
 members of the group were put on trial, but they were released following President
 Habibie's assumption of office in May.
 Security authorities allowed students to carry out huge demonstrations at the
 Parliament complex beginning on May 18. The protests numbered up to 30,000 par-
 ticipants at their peak and helped lead to the resignation of President Soeharto on
 May 21. The military forced the students out of the Parliament early on the morn-
 ing of May 23 without violence.
 The authorities did not stop many demonstrations on a variety of issues that took
 place on a daily basis in the weeks following Soehart's resignation. However, it
 took a strong position, against some demonstrations and gatherings. A large contin-
 ent of security forces physically prevented a large-scale procession to the Par-
 liamentby the independent Indonesian Prosperity Trade union (SBSI) in late June.
 The Government refused to allow Megawati Soekarnoputri to hold a large public
 gathering at Senayan sports stadium in Jakarta to commemorate the second anni-
 versary of the July 27 incident, a government-assisted forcible takeover of PDI head-
 quarters. However, she was able to hold a peaceful event at her home, which was"
 attended by many thousands of persons. Demonstrations by students and nonstu-
 dents intensified in the weeks before the November 10-13 special session of the
 MPR. A majority were permitted to take place by authorities and occurred without
 incident. However, several ended violently, especially on November 13 when secu-
 rity forces fired on and killed demonstrators (see Sections l.a. and 1.c.). Following
 the MPR, demonstrations continued, although most were consisted of smaller
 groups.
 In addition, the Government issued a controversial decree at the end of July that
 required a police permit for demonstrations by more than 50 persons, prohibited
 demonstrations in front of the presidential palace, military facilities, places of wor-
 ship, hospitals, public transport centers, and other important public areas. After a
 great deal of protest, the Government rescinded the decree on August 13, deciding
 instead to submit it in substance to the Parliament for passage into law. On Sep-
 tember 11, using emergency rules to allow it to be passed more quickly as a govern-
 ment regulation rather than a bill, the Government introduced the measure to the
 Parliament. Opposition both inside and outside the Parliament grew, and the Gov-
 ernment was forced to withdraw the proposed regulation on September 29 and to
 submit it again as a proposed law with several key areas revised to meet popular
 demands. The DPR passed the bill on October 22. In its final form, the law on free-
 dom of expression dropped the requirement for a permit to hold a demonstration.
 It required instead that demonstrators notify the police 3 days in advance and ap-
 point someone accountable for every 100 demonstrators. It also dropped a controver-
 sial clause that would have required the media to obtain a police permit to cover
 demonstrations. The restriction on demonstrations near specific sites was retained.
 
 
 920
 This new law was enforced unevenly. Numerous student demonstrations continued
 to be held in Jakarta and around the-country after the law was enacted. However,
 in some cases authorities invoked the new law. For example, on December 16 over
 50 student demonstrators were detained briefly for allegedly holding a protest with-
 out giving 3 days' advance notification. A prominent economist was called in by the
 police on November 30 and questioned about November 14 student demonstrations
 at the Parliament. A police official was quoted in the press as saying that the gath-
 ering had been illegal under the new law because the participants had not notified
 the authorities 3 days in advance.
 The Constitution provides for freedom of association; however, the Government
 places significant controls on the exercise of this right. The 1985 Social Organiza-
 tions Law (ORMAS) requires the adherence of all organizations, including recog-
 nized religions and associations, to the official ideology of Pancasila. This provision,
 which limits political activity, is widely understood as designed to inhibit activities
 of groups seeking to engage in democratic political competition, make Indonesia an
 Islamic state, revive communism, or return the country to a situation of partisan
 ideological division. It empowers the Government to disband any organization that
 it believes to be acting against Pancasila and requires prior government approval
 for any organization's acceptance of funds from foreign donors. A court on August
 10 declared the 1997 Home Affairs Ministry decree banning the PRD illegal.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for religious freedom for mem-
 bers of five accepted religions and belief in one supreme god. The Government recog-
 nizes Islam, Catholicism, Protestantism, Buddhism, and Hinduism and permits the
 practice of the mystical, traditional beliefs of "Aliran Kepercayaan." Although the
 population is over 85 percent Muslim, the practice and teachings of the other recog-
 nized religions generally are respected, and the Government actively promotes mu-
 tual tolerance and harmony among them. However, some restrictions on certain
 types of religious activity, including unrecognized religions, exist.
 Because the first tenet of Pancasila is belief in one Supreme God, atheism is-for-
 bidden. Although individuals are not compelled to practice any particular faith, all
 citizens must choose one of the five officially recognized religions. As this choice
 must be noted on official documents, such as the identification card, failure to iden-
 tify a religion can make it impossible to obtain such documents. The legal require-
 ment to adhere to Pancasila extends to all religious and secular organizations. The
 Government strongly opposes Muslim groups that advocate establishing an Islamic
 state or acknowledging only Islamic law. The Government banned some religions,
 including Jehovah's Witnesses, Baha'i, Confucianism, and in some provinces the
 messianic Islamic sect Darl Arqam. The Government closely monitors Islamic sects
 considered in danger of deviating from orthodox tenets, and in the past on occasion
 it has dissolved such groups.
 High-level officials continued to make public statements and emphasize by exam-
 ple the importance of respect for religious diversity. However, lower level officials
 frequently were alleged to be reluctant to facilitate and protect the rights of reli-
 gious minorities. Minority houses of worship particularly have been targeted for
 damage or destruction during riots (see Section 5). Attacks against minority houses
 of worship and the lack of an effective government response to punish perpetrators
 and prevent further attacks led to allegations of official complicity in some of the
 incidents.
 A 1969 regulation dictates that before a house of worship can be built, agreement
 must be obtained from local residents living near the site, and a license must be
 obtained from the regional office of the Ministry of Religion. Some Christians claim
 that this regulation is being used to discriminate against them and to prevent them
 from building churches. Despite the problems, the building of churches continues.
 The law allows conversion between faiths, and such conversions occur. Independ-
 ent observers note that interfaith marriage between Muslims and non-Muslims have
 become increasingly difficult. Persons from religions outside the five accepted reli-
 gions have difficulty having their marriages recognized officially.
 The Government views proselytizing by recognized religions in areas heavily
 dominated by another recognized religion as potentially disruptive and discourages
 it. Foreign missionary activities are relatively unimpeded, although in East Timor,
 Irian Jaya, -and occasionally elsewhere missionaries have experienced difficulties
 and delays in renewing residence permits, and visas allowing the entrance of new
 foreign clergy are difficult to obtain. Laws and decrees from the 1970's limit the
 number of years that foreign missionaries can spend in Indonesia, with some exten-
 sions granted in remote areas like Irian Jaya. Foreign missionary work is subject
 to the funding stipulations of the ORMAS law. Citizens practicing the recognized
 religions maintain active links with coreligionists inside and outside the country and
 travel abroad for religious gatherings.
 
 
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re.
 patriation.-Although in 1993 the Government drastically reduced the number of
 persons barred either from entering or departing the country from a publicly an-
 nounced figure of 8,897 "blacklisted" persons to a few hundred, such restrictions still
 exist. The Government also restricts movement by citizens and foreigners to and
 within parts of the country. In addition, it requires permits to seek work in a new
 location in certain areas, primarily to control further population movement to
 crowded cities. Special permits are required to visit certain parts of Irian Jaya. Al-
 though former political prisoners associated with the abortive 1965 coup are no
 longer officially required to carry the stamp E.T. on their identity cards, in many
 cases the stamps have not been eliminated in practice (see Section 1.f.. Among
 other restrictions, some former prisoners are still required to obtain permission if
 they want to move. Authorities reportedly imposed a 1-year travel ban on four indi-
 viduals who were being investigated for treason in connection with the November
 13 incident (see Sections L.a. and 1.c.). Most had signed a statement on November
 12 calling for the cancellation of the MPR and an interim government in advance
 of elections, and one allegedly had been present at student demonstrations and ad-
 dressed protestors.
 In past years, the Government offered first asylum to over 125,000 Indochinese
 boat people. The Galang Island camp was closed in 1996 as the last remaining asy-
 lum seekers were repatriated. However, some 14 persons remain who are awaiting
 a resettlement opportunity in another country. The Government has not formulated
 a policy regarding asylum seekers, but in practice it has respected the principle of
 not returning asylum seekers to the country from which they had fled. While the
 law lacks provisions for dealing with refugees/asylees in accordance with the 1951
 U.N. Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees and its 1967 Protocol, the Gov-
 ernment cooperates with the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, which main-
 tains a regional office in Jakarta. There were no reports of the forced return of per-
 sons to a country where they feared persecution, but during the year there was a
 substantial increase in the number of refugees and asylum seekers placed in deten-
 tion pending deportation.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens have not had the ability to change their government through democratic
 means. President Soeharto never faced an electoral challenge. The 1,000-member
 People's Consultative Assembly that reelected him unanimously to a seventh term
 as President on March 11 is constitutionally the highest authority of the State. It
 has met every 5 years to elect the president and vice president and to set the broad
 outlines of state policy. President Soeharto and his Government effectively con-
 trolled the MPR. Soeharto resigned from office on May 21 under pressure from stu-
 dent activists and the parliamentary leadership. B.J. Habibie-his handpicked Vice
 President, long serving Science and Technology Minister, and intimate adviser-re-
 placed him, and nearly two-thirds of the Soeharto Cabinet was carried over into the
 new Government. Since Soeharto resigned in May, many Soeharto loyalists in the
 MPR were replaced before the November special session by members with ties to
 President Habibie and the new leadership of Golkar. Five hundred members of the
 MPR come from the Parliament (DPR), 425 of whose members were elected in the
 May 1997 general election (up from 400 elected members in 1992). Another 500
 members of the MPR are representatives, regional representatives, and representa-
 tives of societal groups. The Soeharto government reportedly had great influence
 over the selection of the majority of these additional 500 delegates. The remaining
 75 members are military appointees to the DPR.
 President Habibie pledged to hold a general election for parliament in the spring
 of 1999, to be followed by an MPR session to elect a president and vice president
 at the end of 1999. The Government and the Parliament agreed that the date of
 the election for parliament would be June 7, 1999, and that the selection of a new
 president and vice president by the MPR would take place in November 1999. There
 has been public pressure to move forward the date for the selection of the president
 and vice president. The Habibie Government drafted new legislation setting out reg-
 ulations governing the election, political parties, and the organization of the DPR
 and MPR and sent it to the DPR in September. At year's end, the Parliament still
 was deliberating these three bills.
 Under a doctrine known as dual function, the military assumes a significant socio-
 political as well as a security role. Members of the military are allotted 75 unelected
 seats in the DPR, in partial compensation for not being permitted to vote. The mili-
 tary occupies numerous key positions in the administration and holds an unelected
 20 percent of the seats in provincial and district parliaments. The other 85 percent
 
 
 of national and 80 percent of regional parliamentary seats are filled through elec-
 tions held every 5 years. All adult citizens, except active duty members of the armed
 forces, convicted criminals serving prison sentences, and some 36,000 former mem-
 bers of the PI, are eligible to vote. In past elections voters chose by secret ballot
 between the three government-approved political organizations, which fielded can-
 didate lists in each electoral district. Those lists were screened by BAKORSTANAS,
 which determines whether candidates were involved in the abortive 1965 coup or
 pose other broadly defined security risks. Critics charge that this screening is un-
 constitutional, since there is no way to appeal the results, and note that it can be
 used to eliminate critics of the Government from Parliament. Strict rules estab-
 lished the length of political campaigns, access to electronic media, schedules for
 public appearances, and the political symbols that could be used.
 The Government has permitted formally only three political organizations to exist
 and contest elections. Following Soeharto's resignation, President Habibie did not
 stop new parties from forming. However, his Government did not recognize them
 p ending the passage of a new law on political parties, which was still before Par-
 liament at year's end. The largest and most important of the recognized parties has
 been GOLKAR, a government-controlled organization of diverse functional groups.
 During his tenure, President Soeharto strongly influenced the selection of the lead-
 ers of GOLKAR, of which he was the senior leader. GOLKAR has eliminated the
 Board of Patrons through which Soeharto previously had exerted control over the
 party. With the assistance of the armed forces, President Habibie backed the suc-
 cessful candidacy of the new GOLKAR General Chairman, who is also the State
 Minister/State Secretary, one of the most powerful positions in the Cabinet.
 GOLKAR traditionally has maintained close institutional links with the armed
 forces. Following Soeharto's resignation, the armed forces stated publicly that they
 would no longer be involved directly in the affairs of GOLKAR or back the ruling
 party in future elections. Despite this statement, the armed forces played a promi-
 nent role in the victory of President Habibie's candidate for GOLKAR Chairman in
 July over a former minister of defense. In December Armed Forces Commander
 Wiranto publicly announced that the armed forces intended to remain neutral dur-
 ing the election. GOLKAR also has close institutional links with KORPRI, the asso-
 ciation to which all civil servants automatically belong. In practice, civil servants
 have been compelled to support GOLKAR, even though they were able to join any
 of the political parties with official permission. Former members of the PM9 and
 some other banned parties may not run for office or be active politically.
 The other two small, legal, political organizations, the United Development Party
 (PPP) and the Indonesian Democratic Party (PDI), were not considered opposition
 parties, and, along with GOLKAR, are required by law to embrace the state ideology
 of Pancasila. The PPP, however, became more independent during the year adopting
 Islam as its organizing principle and opposing GOLKAR proposals in the DPR.
 These smaller parties have not been permitted to maintain party offices below the
 district level, placing them at a disadvantage to the government-supported
 GOLKAR. Government authorities closely scrutinize and often guide the activities
 of the three political organizations. Party leaders may recall members of the DPR
 and the provincial assemblies from office.
 During Soeharto's new order, the DPR was limited to considering bills presented
 to it by government departments and agencies but did not draft laws on its own,
 although it had the constitutional authority to do so. The DPR made technical, and
 occasionally substantive alteration to bills that it reviewed, including changes that
 reflected the interests of outside groups. In the immediate post-Soeharto era, the
 DPR appeared to have a much stronger role in the consideration of legislation. For
 example, it was considering making significant changes to the Government's draft
 of three political bills. In September and October, objections from the public and
 from within the DPR helped convince the Government to withdraw and resubmit
 with revisions legislation related to demonstrations (see Section 2.b.). The DPR also
 initiated an antimonopoly bill.
 While the DPR has been subordinate to the executive branch, its leadership
 played a major role in requesting the resignation of President Soeharto in May. It
 also has been active in scrutinizing government policy and in exercising oversight
 of government budgetary expenditures and program implementation through hear-
 ings at which members of the Cabinet, military commanders, and other high offi-
 cials are asked to testify. The DPR also has become increasingly a focal point of ap-
 peals and petitions from students, workers, displaced farmers, and others charging
 human rights abuses and airing other grievances, and the DPR complex (which is
 also where the MPR meets) was the site of large antigovernment demonstrations in
 May, November, and December, as well as other times during the year.

 While there are no legal restrictions on the role of women in politics, they are
 underrepresented in government. The May 1997 parliamentary election represented
 a step backwards for women in terms of representation in Parliament, with their
 percentage falling from 12 percent to 9 percent of seats. In the Cabinet, 2 of 36 min-
 isters are women.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Although still subjected to monitoring by and interference from the authorities,
 domestic human rights organizations were extremely active in pressing the Govern-
 ment to improve its human rights performance. They pushed for government inves-
 tigation of human rights abuses, including the kidnaping of activists by security
 forces, acted as defense counsel in political trials, advocated the release of political
 prisoners, sought to offer assistance to the victims of human rights atrocities, and
 urged improvements in government policies and legislation. Numerous respected
 NGO representatives became members of a government-established commission in-
 vestigating the May riots and rapes.
 The Government generally considers outside investigations or foreign-based criti-
 cism of alleged human rights violations to be interference in its internal affairs. It
 emphasizes its belief that the linkage of foreign assistance, or other sanctions, to
 its human rights observance constitutes interference in its internal affairs and is
 therefore unacceptable.
 ICRC access to political prisoners in East Timor improved over the course of the
 year, with the ICRC generally allowed access to prisoners that it could identify as
 being detained. Earlier in the year it had been denied access to some detainees.
 Generally, ICRC prisoner access in East Timor in some cases was limited with re-
 gard to the confidentiality of communication with those detained. ICRC requests for
 access topolitical prisoners elsewhere continued to meet with mixed success. In De-
 cember ICRC was allowed to visit areas of northern Irian Jaya where a number of
 persons were reported either missing or in custody following political demonstra-
 tions in early July. An ICRC program of food and medical assistance in the south
 central highland area of Irian Jaya continued until July, but it was not extended
 despite ICRO offers to continue it The ICRC was allowed to visit prisoners and oth-
 ers detained by security forces in Aceh beginning in May after having had to cease
 operations in Aceh since March 1997. However, the Government objected to the
 ICRC's opening of an office in Aceh, where it is working with families of those killed
 or missing due to security force activities against separatists. It ultimately was al-
 lowed to operate an office in conjunction with the Indonesian Red Cross. Coopera-
 tion by civilian and military officials in Aeh and at the central government level,
 generally was good. Elsewhere, the ICRC was able to visit prisoners convicted of in-
 volvement in the violence of 1965-66, convicted Muslim extremists, and East Timor-
 ese, as well as other political prisoners outside of East Timor, Aceh, and Irian Jaya.
 The ICRC was not able to play a significant role in the matter of the kidnaping,
 extrajudicial detention, and torture of political activists by security forces, although
 it made known to the Government its willingness to be of humanitarian assistance
 in these matters.
 The Government-appointed National Human Rights Commission, in its fifth year
 of operation, continued to be active in examining reported human rights violations
 and continued to show independence. Lacking enforcement powers, the Commission
 attempts to work within the system, sending teams where necessary to inquire into
 possible human rights problems. It employs persuasion, publicity, and moral author-
 ity to highlight abuses, to make recommendations for legal and regulatory changes,
 and to encourage corrective action. The Government appointed the Commission's
 original chairmen, who then appointed the other 24 original commission members.
 The Commission selected a new chairman and six replacement members in Decem-
 ber.
 Throughout the year, the Commission consistently became involved in the most
 difficult human rights issues, including the disappearance of activists, the Trisakti
 shootings, the May riots and rapes, reports of mass graves in Aceh, violent action
 against protesters in Irian Jaya, the situation in East Timor, and a spate of killings
 in Banyuwangi, East Java. The Commission was able to issue highly credible public
 reports or press statements that carried significant weight in informing public opin-
 ion.
 The Government ignored some Commission findings or, in some instances, moved
 lethargically in reaction to them. The Commission issued a report that clearly stated
 that rapes of ethnic Chinese women occurred during the May riots and called for
 the establishment of a national investigative commission. President Habibie publicly
 acknowledged the rapes, and the Government in July set up an investigation com-
 
 
 mission. However, in August high-level military officials began questioning publicly
 whether any rapes had taken place. In 1995 the Commission identified six cases of
 ABRI abuse of indigenous people in Irian Jaya, involving a number of deaths and
 rapes; only one extrajudicial killing was ever brought to trial, and the Commission
 requested follow-u p action in 1997. The Government made no further response to
 the Commission's October 1996 report on the July 27 incident.
 The Commission opened an East Timor branch in 1996, which was widely re-
 garded as a positive step in the effort to address and resolve human rights abuses
 there. However, the office limited itself to dealing only with nonpolitical cases and
 was located next to the local military headquarters. It therefore had little impact
 with regard to the more serious human right problems in East Timor. However,
 in July a-respected East Timorese was appointed director of the office.
 The MPR passed a decree on human rights at its November special session, which
 called on government institutions and officials to respect human rights and for the
 ratification 'of international human rights agreements (not in violation of the state
 ideology Pancasila or the Constitution). It also mandated that a human rights com-
 mission be established by law (the current Commission is established by presi-
 dential decree only). Such legislation is in preparation within the Government, and
 Commission members have discussed publicly the goal of strengthening the Com-
 mission's investigatory authority (e.g., the auth6rity to summon witnesses).
 Parliamentary delegations visited Aceh and Irian Jaya to investigate reports, of
 human rights abuse. In August the Government signed a memorandum of under-
 standing with the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights
 (UNHCHR) regarding "cooperation in the development and implementation of com-
 prehensive programs for the promotion and. protection of human rights in Indo-
 nesia," which is understood to include the assignment of a UNHCHR program offi-
 cer to Jakarta, who would have access to East Timor and all other parts of Indo-
 nesia. The U.N. Special Rapporteur for Violence Against Women visited Indonesia
 during the year.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution does not explicitly forbid discrimination based on gender, race,
 disability, language, or social status. However, it stipulates equal rights and obliga-
 tions for all citizens, both native and. naturalized. The 1993 Guidelines of State Pol-
 icy (legal statutes adopted by the MPR) explicitly states that women have the same
 rights, obligations, and opportunities as men. However, guidelines from 1978, 1983,
 1988, and 1993, also state that women's participation in the development process
 must not conffict with their role in improving family welfare and the education of
 the younger generation. Marriage law dictates that the man is the head of the fam-
 ily. The Constitution grants citizens the right to practice their individual religion
 and beliefs; however, the Government only recognizes five religions and imposes
 some restrictions on other religious activity.
 Women-Violence against women remains poorly documented. However, the Gov-
 ernment has acknowledged the problem of domestic violence in society, which has
 been aggravated by social changes brought about by rapid urbanization. Rape by a
 husband of a wife is not considered a crime under the law. Although women's
 groups are trying to change the law, they have not made significant progress.
 Cultural norms dictate that problems between husband and wife are private mat-
 ters, and violence against women in the home rarely is reported. While police could
 bring assault charges against a husband for beating his wife, due to social attitudes
 they are unlikely to do so. Nonetheless, according to reliable sources, the police have
 become somewhat more responsive to domestic violence complaints.
 Rape is a punishable offense. Men have been arrested and sentenced for rape and
 attempted rape although reliable statistics are unavailable. The maximum prison
 sentence for rape is 12 years, but observers say that sentences are usually much
 shorter. Mob violence against accused rapists frequently is reported. Women's rights
 activists believe that rape is seriously underreported due to the social stigma at-
 tached to the victim. Some legal experts report that unless a woman goes imme-
 diately to the hospital for an examination that produces physical evidence of rape,
 she can not bring charges. A witness also is required in order to bring charges, and
 only in rare cases is there a witness, according to legal experts. Some women report-
 edly fail to report rape to police because the police do not take their allegations seri-
 ously.
 Women's advocates believe that domestic abuse increased during the year as an
 indirect result of the economic crisis. Like rape, domestic violence is believed to be
 seriously underreported. In December a women's rights NGO estimated that only
 15 percent of domestic violence incidents are reported. The Government provides
 
 
 some counseling for abused women, and several private organizations exist to assist
 women. Many of these organizations focus on reuniting the family rather than on
 providing protection to the women involved. Many women rely on the extended fam-
 ily system for assistance in cases of domestic violence. In June the Government, in
 consultation with women's NGO's, established a National Commission on Violence
 against Women. The Commission's mandate is to improve and coordinate govern-
 ment and NGO efforts to combat violence against women and to provide assitance
 to victims. There are only a few women's crisis centers including a drop-in center
 founded in Jakarta by the government-sponsored National Women's Organization
 (KOWANI) in 1996 and a crisis center for women in Yogyarkarta run by an NGO.
 A new crisis center for women, Women's Partner, which opened in 1997, runs a 24-
 hour hot line and a temporary shelter for abused women. Training of counselors for
 another Jakarta crisis center, called Speak, is under way.
 Serious charges emerged in the early summer that 168 ethnic Chinese women and
 girls were targeted systematically for rape and sexual abuse during the civil dis-
 turbances of May 12-14. The allegations were given credence by the National
 Human Rights Commission, a government-s ponsored body, which issued a prelimi-
 nary report in July charging that rofe     c Chinese women and girls was car-
 ried out in an organized andcoordinated manner over a 3-day period in Jakarta and
 several other major cities. The allegations have been challenged by police and mili-
 tary officials. In November the government-appointed fact-finding team, which in-
 cluded official and NGO representatives, issued its report, verifying 85 reports of vi-
 olence against women during the riots, including 66 rapes. The team stated that the
 number of incidents probably was higher but that intimidation against witnesses
 "and victims, as well as the reluctance of some victims to report the attacks, had pre-
 vented the team from documenting more attacks.
 Harassment is not a crime under the law, only indecent behavior. However, sex-
 ual harassment charges can damage a ivii service career. The law reportedly covers
 physical abuse only, and requires two witnesses. Female job applicants and workers
 have complained of being victimized sexually by foremen and factory owners.
 Ther repo  credible reports of trafficking in women and of temporary "contract
 marriages" with foreigners in certain areas, such as Kalimantan and Sumatra,
 though the extent of this practice is unclear. These marriages are not considered
 legal, and the children born from them are considered born out of wedlock. Prostitu-
 tion is widespread. Official stattiscs from 1994 report that there were 70,684 pros-
 titutes in Indonesia, 9,000 of whom were in Jakarta. A local NGO estimates that
 there e a at least 650,000 prostitutes in the country, includinh 5,000 who are reg-
 istered as prostitutes. Many believe the figure to be much higher as women who
 lost their jobs as a result of the economic crisis seek other ways to earn money for
 their families. By comparison, there were 72,000 registered prostitutes in 1995.
 In September more than a hundred women from Java, including some minors, re-
 ported that they and other women had been held against their will on an island
 in Riau province, Sumatra, and forced to work as prostitutes. The women claimed
 that they had been recruited with the understanding that they would be employed
 as waitresses in resorts on the island. They were prevented from leaving after dis-
 covering that they were recruited to be sex workers. The International Labor Orga-
 nization's report on the sex act is n Southeast Asia, released in August, esti-
 mated that Indonesia's sex sector accounted for from 0.8 to 2.4 percent of GDP.
 Female domestic servants are vulnerable to exploitation and abuse. In April Ja-
 karta police raided a building where more than 900 women had been held against
 their will for up to 4 months by a recruitment agency preparing to send them to
 the Middle East to work as domestic servants. Again in October, hundreds of women
 were freed in Jakarta after being held against their will for 2 to 8 months by an
 agency that had promised to place them abroad as domestic servants.
 According to the Constitution, women are equal to and have the same rights, obli-
 gations, and opportunities as men. However, in practice women face some legal dis-
 crimination. Marriage law dictates that the man is the head of the family. Marriage
 lasw for Muslims, based on Islamic law, allows men to have up to four wives if the
 husband can provide equally for each of his wives. Permission of the first wife is
 required, but reportedly most women cannot refuse. Civil servants who wish to
 marry a second woman also must have permission from their supervisors. Cabinet
 officials and military personnel customarily have been forbidden to have second
 wives. In divorce cases women often bear a heavier evidentiary burden than men,
 especially in the Islamic-based family court system. Divorced women rarely receive
 alimony, and there is no enforcement of alimony payment.
 The 1958 Citizenship Law states that children's citizenship is based only on the
 citizenship of the father. Children of citizen mothers and foreign fathers are consid-
 ered foreigners and need visas to remain in the country until the age of 18, when
 
 
 they can apply for citizenship. They are prohibited from  attending Indonesian
 schools and have to attend international schools, which are expensive.
 Foreign women married to citizens also face difficulties. Their children are citi-
 zens and thus are not allowed to attend international schools in Indonesia. These
 women usually are taxed as the foreign head of household, but they do not have
 property, business, or inheritance rights. There has been much discussion about
 problems with the citizenship law, and NGO's and the Government appear to agree
 that the law needs to be revised. However, by year's end the Government still had
 not taken any action to remedy these problems.
 Although some women enjoy a high degree of economic and social freedom and
 occupy important positions in both the public and private sectors, the majority do
 not enjoy such social and economic freedoms and are represented disproportionately
 at the lower end of the socioeconomic scale. The 1995 national profile of women's
 positions and roles showed that 37.4 percent of civil servants were women, but only
 5.5 percent were in positions of authority.
 Female workers in manufacturing generally receive lower wages then men. Many
 female factory workers are hired as day laborers instead of as full-time permanent
 employees, and companies are not required to provide benefits, such as maternity
 leave, to day laborers. Women's rights activists report that there is a growing trend
 in manufacturing to hire women to do work in their homes for less than the mini-
 mum wage. Unemployment rates for women are approximately 50 percent higher
 than for men. Women, often are not given the extra benefits and salary that are
 their due when they are the head of household, and in some cases do not receive
 employment benefits for their husband and children, such as medical insurance and
 income tax deductions. Income disparity between men and women diminishes sig-
 nificantly with greater educational achievement.
 Despite laws that provide women with a 3-month maternity leave, the Govern-
 ment has acknowledged that pregnant women often are dismissed or are replaced
 while on leave. Some companies require that women sign statements that they do
 not intend to become pregnant. The Employment Law mandates 2 days of men-
 strual leave per month for women, although this leave is not allowed in all cases.
 Many groups criticized the 1997 Manpower Law for not addressing sexual harass-
 ment and violence against women in the workplace and for providing inadequate
 protection in areas of employment where women regularly have suffered abuse, such
 as overseas employment and household service. The Government has postponed im-
 plementation of the new Manpower Law for 2 years to allow time for its revision.
 Women disproportionately experience illiteracy, poor health, and inadequate nu-
 trition. The Government is making efforts to reduce the high maternal mortality
 rate, which is 425 per 100,000 live births, according to official figures, and up to
 650, according to estimates from other sources. According to U.N. data, two-thirds
 of women are anemic, and 24 percent of women of reproductive age suffer from
 chronic energy deficiency. Women's educational indicators have improved in the last
 decade. The number of girls graduating from high school tripled from 1980 to 1990.
 Women's advocacy groups became more assertive during the year. In February
 three women's advocates from the group Voices of Concerned Mothers were detained
 after they led a protest against the rising price of milk. The three were convicted
 in a highly publicized trial of staging a parade without a permit and were fined.
 Numerous conferences and rallies concerned with women's issues were held
 throughout the year. Most were sponsored by NGO's, but some were organized by
 academic institutions and government ministries. In December the first National
 Women's Congress brought together more than 500 women from a broad range of
 economic and sociopolitical perspectives. The Congress concluded with calls for a
 greater role for women in government, an end to the military's "dual function" in
 defense and politics, and a referendum in East Timor about the territory's future
 political status.
 Children.--The Government has expressed a commitment to children's rights and
 welfare but a lack of resources prevents it from translating this commitment into
 practice. The Government allocates only 2.2 percent of gross national product to
 education. Spending on education declined significantly in real terms during the
 year, due to economic contraction. A 1979 law on children's welfare defines the re-
 sponsibility of the State and parents to nurture and protect children. However, the
 law's provisions on protection of children have yet to go into effect; implementing
 regulations have never been promulgated. The Government has made particular ef-
 forts to improve primary education and maternity services.
 Low cost medical care is available, although access, and availability are sometimes
 sporadic, especially in rural areas. Moreover, government spending on health care
 dropped in real terms due to the economic contraction. According to U.N. data, 34
 percent of children under 5 years of age suffer from protein-energy malnutrition,
 
 
 927
 and 35 percent suffer from iron deficiency. In October the U.N. Children's Fund
 (UNICEF) warned of a "lost generation" of Indonesian youth as a result of the eco-
 nomic crisis which started in mid-1997. UNICEF estimated that 50 percent of chil-
 dren below the age of 2 were undernourished, threatening the development of brain
 function. Provincial authorities in Central Java noted a sharp increase in infant
 mortality attributed to poor nutrition among mothers. NGO research in a district
 of Central Java documented an increase in underweight infants from 8 percent in
 1996 to 14 percent in 1998. In Jakarta city health officials also noted a sharp in-
 crease in reports of child malnutrition.
 A 1994 law raised compulsory education from 6 to 9 years, but the law has not
 been implemented fully due to inadequate school facilities and the lack of family fi-
 nancial resources to support children to stay in school. Official and unofficial fees
 for public education, including payments for registration, books, meals, transport,
 and uniforms have become prohibitively high for many families. Although primary
 education is in principle universal, the UNICEF estimates that more than I million
 children drop out of primary school every year due mainly to the costs associated
 with education and the need for the children to supplement family income. A credi-
 ble NGO estimated that millions of children dropped out of primary school in 1998
 because their families could no longer afford school fees and related expenses due
 to the economic crisis.
 Although statistics are not yet available, children's advocates and labor analysts
 agree that the number of working children has increased significantly due to the
 economic crisis which continued to affect the country. According to recent govern-
 ment statistics, 8 percent of all children between the ages of 10 and 14 work. Half
 go to school and also work, and half work exclusively. Unofficial estimates of work-
 ing children are higher. A prominent NGO estimated that more than 10 percent of
 children worked more than 4 hours per day.
 According to the Ministry of Social Affairs, 20,000 street children lived in Jakarta
 in 1997. NGO's report that the number in Jakarta may have increased by more than
 60 percent as a result of the economic crisis. The number of street children also
 grew in other cities. Street children sell newspapers, shine shoes, help to park or
 watch cars, and otherwise attempt to earn money. Many-children work under haz-
 ardous conditions as scavengers and garbage pickers and on fishing platforms and
 fishing boats. According to credible sources, there are several thousand children
 working in hazardous conditions on fishing platforms off the east coast of north Su-
 matra (see Section 6.c.). Many thousands work in factories and fields (see Section
 6.d.).
 Street children and child laborers in some cities have become organized and inter-
 ested in protecting their rights. At least 30 NGO's work with street children. NGO's
 have criticized the Government for making insufficient and inadequate efforts to
 help street children and working children. The Government is working in coopera-
 tion with the U.N. Development Program, UNICEF, the ILO, and with NGO's to
 create programs for street children and child laborers. One project incorporates
 many ideas generated by the NGO community, including establishing "open houses"
 in targeted areas that provide vocational training and basic education to street chil-
 dren. Efforts have been initiated to start open houses for street children in seven
 provinces.
 Another approach to the street children problem utilizes the National Program for
 Discipline and Clean Cities Decree. Under this program, street children are removed
 physically from cities by bus. Usually, they are taken outside the city and left there.
 Sometimes they are taken to "hnolding houses" where they are first interrogated and
 later released. NGO's criticize this practice as ineffective and inhuman.
 Child prostitution and other sexual abuses occur, but firm data are lacking. While
 there are laws designed to protect children from indecent activities, prostitution,
 and incest, the Government has made no special enforcement efforts in these areas.
 A credible NGO asserts that it has seen a pattern of increased child prostitution
 resulting from the economic crisis during 1997 and 1998. Although reliable nation-
 wide statistics remain elusive, NGO findings indicate a growth trend in child pros-
 titution and sexual exploitation. A credible NGO reported instances of families in
 rural areas of Java and Sumatra being forced by economic circumstances to "sell"
 their daughters to local men. Another report indicating an increase in child prostitu-
 tion counted 1,500 underage prostitutes working in just one province in Sumatra.
 A separate criminal justice system for juveniles does not exist. Police officials
 admit that juveniles often are imprisoned with adult offenders. Ordinary courts
 handle juvenile crime. A Juvenile Justice Law was passed by Parliament in Decem-
 ber 1996 and was signed by President Soeharto in 1997. It defines juveniles as chil-
 dren between the ages of 8 and 18 and establishes a special court system and crimi-
 nal code for them.
 
 
 Female genital mutilation (FGM), which is widely condemned by international
 health experts as damaging to both physical and _psychological health, is. practiced
 in some parts of Indonesia. The method varies depending on ethnic, cultural and
 religious tradition. However, the most prevalent practice is a ceremonial one that
 involves the pricking, scraping, or touching of the clitoris of a baby or young girl,
 often with the purpose of drawing several drops of blood. Sometimes, a plant root
 is used symbolically, and the girl is not touched. A more serious form of FGM in-
 volves the removal of the tip of the clitoris. This practice appears to be declining,
 and there is disagreement about how widely practiced it is. It reportedly still is
 practiced in Madura, South Sulawesi, and other areas. Since FGM is not regulated,
 and religious leaders have taken no formal position, the method used is often left
 up to the local traditional practitioner. FGM usually takes place within the first
 year after birth, often on the 40th day, though it is done in some areas up to the
 age of 10. It is performed either at a hospital or, especially in rural areas, by the
 local traditional practitioner. There are no statistics available on FGM.
 People With Disabilities.-According to U.N. estimates, there are 10 million dis-
 abled persons in the country, while the Ministry of Social Affairs estimates that 3
 percent of the population, or 6 million persons, are disabled. However, there are no
 precise statistics. Families often hide their disabled family members to avoid social
 stigma or embarrassment. The disabled face considerable discrimination in employ-
 ment, although some factories have made special efforts to hire disabled workers.
 Several provinces have established "rehabilitation centers" for the disabled. Dis-
 abled persons reportedly are taken off the streets by the authorities and brought
 to these centers for job training. Many disabled citizens beg for a living.
 NGO's are the primary providers of education for the disabled. There are 1,084
 schools for the disabled; 680 are private, and 404 are government schools. Of the
 government schools 165 are "integrated," serving both regular and special education
 students. In Jakarta there are 98 schools for the disabled, 2 of which are govern-
 ment-run, and 96 of which are private. The Government also runs three national
 schools for the visually, hearing, and mentally disabled. These schools accept chil-
 dren from throughout the country.
 A disability law was passed in 1997. Implementing regulations have not been
 issued, so the impact of the law remains unclear. The law strives to provide access
 to education, employment, and assistance for the disabled. It requires companies
 that employ over 100 persons to give 1 percent of their jobs to the disabled. The
 law mandates accessibility for the disabled to public facilities. However, virtually no
 buildings or public transportation have been designed with such accessibility in
 mind.
 The Constitution requires that the Government provide care for orphans and the
 disabled, but it does not specify how the term "care" should be defined, and the pro-
 vision of education to all mentally and physically disabled children has never been
 inferred. Regulations specify that the Government establish and regulate a national
 curriculum for special education by stipulating that the "community" should provide
 special education services to its children.
 Indigenous People.-The Government considers the term "indigenous people" to be
 a misnomer, because it considers all Indonesians except ethnic Chinese to be indige-
 nous. Nonetheless, it publicly recognizes the existence of several "isolated commu-
 nities," and that they have a right to participate fully in political and social life.
 The Government estimates that the number of persons in isolated communities is
 1.5 million. This includes, but is not limited to, groups such as the Dayak population
 in Kalimantan who live in remote forest areas, indigenous communities throughout
 Irian Jaya, and economically disadvantaged families living as sea nomads on boats
 near Riau in east Sumatra and near Ujung Pandang in southern Sulawesi. Critics
 maintain that the Government's approach is basically paternalistic and designed
 more to integrate indigenous people into society than to protect their traditional
 way of life. Human rights monitors criticize the Government's transmigration pro-
 gram for violating the rights of indigenous people (see Section 1.f.).
 Sixty percent of the population of over 200 million live in Java, which represents
 only 7 percent of the country's territory. The government-sponsored transmigration
 program seeks to resettle people from densely populated areas to sparsely populated
 areas outside Java. The majority of migrants are spontaneous migrants who are not
 part of the official program. The current 5-year development plan calls for 600,000
 families to be resettied, with 80,000 planned for the 1997-98 fiscal year.
 Critics of transmigration claim that it often threatens indigenous cultures and
 sparks social envy. Some critics claim that it has been used as a political tool to
 inject nonindigenous persons into certain areas to "esianize" these areas, in part to
 preclude secessionist movements. A senior government official has confirmed this.
 In some areas, such as in certain parts of Kalimantan, East Timor, and Irian Jaya,
 
 
 929
 relations between transmigrants and indigenous people are hostile. NGO's also re-
 part tensions between transmigrated Javanese and indigenous populations in the
 entawai Islands off the west coast of Sumatra. Indigenous groups often complain
 that they receive less government support and funding than transmigrants, and
 transmigrants complain that in some cases they are moved to areas with inadequate
 infrastructure to support them and less than desirable land. Transmigrants also
 may be settled on land of disputed ownership.
 Tensions are particularly acute in West Kalimantan between the indigenous
 Dayak people and settlers from Madura, an island off the eastern coast of Java. The
 past 30 years have been marked by periodic violent confrontations between the two
 communities, growing partly out of the Dayaks' perception that they were being
 marginalized in their native lands. The Madurese community in West Kalimantan
 grew around an earlier core of transmigrants, although the majority of Madurese
 in the area are spontaneous immigrants.
 The Government's emphasis on relatively rapid growth and development strate-
 gies, burgeoning urbanization, and aggressive government-backed commercial ex-
 ploitation of natural resources results in continued tension over land tenure issues.
 That tension often is expressed along racial/ethnic lines as developers are frequently
 ethnic Chinese Indonesians. Land disputes represent the largest category of com-
 plain ts  mi              io    Hs Commission and a significant por-
 tion of the cases brought to legal aid foundations and other legal assistance organi-
 zations.
 According to a law derived from colonial-era practices, all subsurface mineral re-
 sources belong to the Government. The Basic Agrarian Law states that land rights
 cannot be "in conflict with national and state interests," which provides the Govern-
 ment with a broad legal basis for land seizures. When disputes cannot be settled
 the Government has the authority to define fair compensation for land. There are
 numerous instances of the use of intimidation, sometimes by the military, and often
 by hired "thugs," to acquire land for development projects, particulariy in areas
 claimed by indigenous people.
 Such intimidation has been used in Jakarta, other parts of Java, North Sumatra,
 Aceh, and other areas. Compensation paid for the land is often minimal or even
 nonexistent. According to credible sources in West Sumatra, large tracts of land in
 the province have been confiscated over the past several years by commercial plan-
 tation developers who paid bribes to the local governor. In some cases, NGOsre-
 port, farmers growing rice and other crops were evicted from the land they were
 planting without compensation to make way for new palm oil plantations staffed by
 Javanese transmigrants. A local NGO alleged that, when its staff members visited
 the area in the summer to investigate land dispute claims made by local commu-
 nities, "thugs" hired by local officials intimidated them.
 NGO's assert that violations of the rights of indigenous people are frequent in
 mining and logging areas and state that violations stem from thie State's denial of
 ownership by indigenous people of ancestral land, erosian of indigenous groups' tra-
 ditional social structure, and forced takeover of land. These problems are most prev-
 alent in Irian Jaya and Kadimantan.
 In 1998 an internationally recognized environmentalist, Loir Botor Dingit, who is
 also a paramount chief of the Dayak tribe of East Kalimantan, was brought to trial;
 the Government charged him with forgery and perjury. The charges stem from the
 tribe's opposition to logging operations being conducted on land claimed by the tribe.
 The operations were being conducted by a company owned by a former minister and
 close associate of Soeharto. The defendant alleged that he had been threatened re-
 peatediy and harassed by security forces for his opposition to the logging (see Sec-
 tion i.e.). The charges against Dingit were dropped in November.
 In Central Kalimantan, NGO's report that local residents have suffered as a re-
 suit of a project to turn 1 million hectares of peat land into agricultural land for
 rice cultivation. The site is designated as a major transmigration area. According
 to credible sources, 100,000 indigenous people are affected by the project. Forced to
 cease their traditional farming and forest-based livelihoods, many indigenous people
 living in the area have become poorly paid laborers on the project.
 There were credible reports that bonded labor has become a problem for some
 Dayaks in East Kalimantan. According to the ILO, on at least one project, a logging
 company established a company store in a remote area, where workers had to pur-
 chase necessities at inflated prices. Since the workers could not afford the prices,
 they bought the goods using vouchers representing future wages, thereby, according
 to the ILO, "turning once independent and relatively well-off farmers into impover-
 ished bonded laborers trapped in an ever-mounting cycle of debt."
 Where indigenous people clash with commercial/private sector development
 projects, the developers almost always win. Decisions regarding development
 
 
 projects, resource-use concessions, and other economic activities generally are car-
 ried out without the participation or informed consent of the affected communities.
 Some NGO's that sought to aid these communities were subjected to verbal attacks,
 raids, and other forms of intimidation by government security forces.
 Tensions with indigenous people in Irian Jaya continued. Indigenous Irian Jaya
 residents complain of racism, religious bias, paternalism, and condescension as con-
 stant impediments to better relations with non-Irianese people, including members
 of the Government, the military, and the non-Irianese business community. A large
 percentage of the population of Irian Jaya is now made up of migrants, who are eco-
 nomically and politically dominant. A clash between indigenous people and recent
 migrants over gold mining claims in the area of Nabire led to te stabbing death
 of three Irianese and nine non-Irianese in August. Most civil servants in local gov-
 ernments in Irian Jaya and other isolated areas continue to come primarily from
 other parts of Indonesia, rather than from the local indigenous population. There
 were credible reports of serious human rights abuses by the security forces in Biak
 following proindependence demonstrations, and new revelatiofis of abuses by secu-
 rity forces pursuing separatists in the central highlands of Irian Jaya (see Sections
 L.a. and 1.c.). There was a proindependence demonstration in Manokwari in early
 October. When police dispersed the demonstrators, persons in the crowd threw
 rocks, injuring one policeman and damaging shops and houses. Six persons, includ-
 ing a tribal leader, were arrested in Jayapura in early October on suspicion of plan-
 ning proindependence demonstrations. They were conditionally released later in the
 month. Also in October, 19 persons went on trial on sedition charges in connection
 with the Biak proindependence demonstrations. At year's end, the trial of 10 per-
 sons accused in connection with the July '7 proindependence demonstration in
 Wanena had not yet begun. Twenty-four others are awaiting trial elsewhere in
 Irian Jaya on similar charges. No members of the security forces have been charged
 or held accountable for their harsh response to the July demonstrations.
 In August the Government announced the withdrawal of 270 troops from the
 Timika area and 394 troops from the task force operating in the central highlands.
 On October 1, Armed Forces Commander Wiranto announced that he had decided
 to withdraw the status of "military operational area" from Irian Jaya. However, the
 province is still designated a "critical control area."
 In September President Habibie agreed to a recommendation from the Indonesian
 Council of Churches that the Government hold a national dialog on Irian Jaya. Rep-
 resentatives from Irian Jaya and from the Irianese community in Jakarta met with
 government officials in late October and early November to draft terms of reference
 for the dialog. By year's end, no date has been set, but Minister of State/State Sec-
 retary Akbar Tanjung told the press in mid-December that the Government planned
 to hold the dialog after the Idul Fitri holiday in January 1999. Some Irianese have
 expressed disappointment in the Governmens approach to the preparations.
 A large foreign mining concession area near Timika continued to draw attention
 and controversy. In March a foreign court dismissed with prejudice a 1996 suit
 brought by a local indigenous leader. In December a council of indigenous represent-
 atives announced that it would continue to press the lawsuit against the company
 "until such time as a comprehensive, honest, and fair solution has been reached be-
 tween the parties, on an equal footing." In June a landslide into a lake into which
 mine tailings are deposited caused the lake to overflow, damaging settlements and
 crops. An environmental group blamed the company's mining practices, while the
 company cited unusually heavy rains as the cause of the landslide and flooding. In-
 digenous residents, including the governor of Irian Jaya, demanded that the central
 Government return a greater percentage of the mine's revenues to the province. The
 mine was shut down for 5 days when mine workers went on strike in August. The
 strike ended when the local military and police commanders held a meeting with
 workers and company officials. A parliamentary committee that visited Irian Jaya
 in August recognized that the company's presence should be maintained and se-
 cured, and it suggested the company negotiate with the residents regarding de-
 mands for the company to increase its participation in the improvement of commu-
 nity welfare. The committee also recommended that the negotiated agreements be
 set forth in a contract to give them a legal basis and that company funds for devel-
 opment of the mine area be disbursed in a fair, transparent, and organized manner.
 Religious Minorities.-During the year, there were instances of attacks on church-
 es, temples, and other religious facilities, ranging in nature from minor vandalism
 to arson. There were also instances of preaching and publications against Chris-
 tians, which led to concerns that societal support for religious tolerance was under
 pressure. Christian groups recorded 128 instances of attacks on churches and other
 Christian facilities during the year, 76 of which occurred following the accession to
 office of President Habibie in May. The attacks ranged in severity from broken
 
 
 931
 windowpanes to total destruction. The Government has not resolved fully man,
 cases of attacks on religious facilities and churches that occurred during riots an
 in other cases, has not investigated at all.
 On February 13, serious anti-Christian and antiethnic Chinese violence broke out
 in west Java. Twenty-eight churches were attacked in several towns east and south-
 east of Jakarta. Mobs stoned windows, vandalized interiors, and in some cases at-
 tempted to burn the churches. Cars and other property belonging to the church and
 church members also were targeted for vandalism. Incidents such as these reflect
 religious tensions, as well as in some cases underlying socioeconomic and political
 tensions between poor Muslims and relatively more affluent ethnic Chinese Chris-
 tians.
 On July 24, a Protestant church was burned in the Depok area of south Jakarta.
 The church's congregation was Batak, an ethnic group with origins in north Suma-
 tra. Although the church was in close proximity to a police station, the mob spent
 hours demolishing it to its foundations with sledgehammers. Police have made no
 progress investigating the incident.
 In late November, a brawl in Ketapang, West Jakarta, between Muslim local resi-
 dents and Christian security guards of a gambling den, who were mainly of Ambo-
 nese descent, escalated into a riot in which 14 were killed and 27 local churches
 and Christian schools were attacked, and in some cases destroyed. The anti-Chris-
 tian violence in Jakarta prompted retaliatory anti-Muslim violence in Kupang, West
 Timor, in late November and early December. In Kupang (where Muslims are a mi-
 nority), Christian mobs burned four mosques and several homes and shops belong-
 ing to Muslims. Five other mosques and a number of houses were damaged and doz-
 ens were injured. In both the Jakarta and Kupang incidents, interethnic tensions,
 as well as interreligious tensions, were factors contributing to the violence.
 Muslims are a religious minority in the easternmost province of Irian Jaya. In
 January a mosque was burned down in a small village near Kurima in the central
 highlands of Irian Jaya. The attack on the mosque apparently was motivated by
 local sentiment against the efforts of Muslim missionaries to win converts in the
 predominantly Christian province. The incident also reflected local resentment of
 the arrival in the province of mainly Muslim migrants from other parts of the coun-
 try. Interreligious tensions remain high in the province.
 NationallRacial/Ethnic Minorities.-The Government officially promotes racial
 and ethnic tolerance. Ethnic Chinese, at approximately 3 percent of the population
 by far the largest nonindigenous minority group, historically have played a major
 role in the economy. In 1998 anti-Chinese sentiment led to serious and widespread
 attacks on Chinese-owned businesses, especially in the disturbances of May 12-14.
 Credible charges emerged that attacks on Chinese property during the May rioting
 were in some cases organized rather than spontaneous in nature, and that attacks
 on Chinese property were coordinated in Jakarta and in other cities and towns
 across the country. Charges that members of the security forces were involved in
 these attacks had not been fully investigated by year's end.
 Both the Government and NGO's also are investigating allegations that during
 the May riots, more than 150 ethnic Chinese women and girls were targeted for
 rape in Jakarta and other cities, as part of a campaign to spread terror among the
 ethnic Chinese community (see Section 1.c.). Allegations of the organized destruction
 of Chinese property and the systematic mass rape of Chinese women are very con-
 troversial, and both official and private investigations of these charges found it dif-
 ficult to produce concrete evidence, particularly first-hand testimony. Despite these
 difficulties, in November a government-appointed, fact-finding team verified 66
 rapes that occurred during the riots, involving primarily ethnic Chinese women and
 girls, as well as numerous other acts of violence against women.
 Since 1959 noncitizen ethnic Chinese have been denied the right to run busi-
 nesses in rural Indonesia. Regulations prohibit the operation of Chinese schools, for-
 mation of exclusively Chinese cultural groups or trade associations, and public dis-
 play of Chinese characters, although Chinese characters are seen on some products.
 The Government permits the publication of a government-owned, Chinese-language
 daily newspaper, but otherwise legislation bans the import, sale or distribution of
 Chinese-language material (see Sections 1.f. and 2.a.). However, Chinese-language
 materials have begun to appear in Chinese neighborhoods in Jakarta and possibly
 elsewhere. Since 1994 the Government has allowed Chinese-language instruction for
 employees in the tourism industry, and it has allowed distribution of locally printed
 Chinese-language tourist brochures, programs, and similar material to Chinese
 speaking tourists.
 Private instruction in Chinese generally is prohibited but takes place to a limited
 extent. The University of Indonesia offers Chinese language courses. State univer-
 sities have informal quotas that limit the number of ethnic Chinese students. The
 
 
 law forbids the celebration of the Chinese New Year in temples or public places, but
 enforcement is limited. Chinese New Year decorations were displayed prominently
 and sold in public shopping areas in at least a few cities. Senior officials previously
 have shown reluctance to relax the ban on Chinese-language publications, citing
 concerns that such an action could promote interracial tensions.
 East Timorese and various human rights groups charge that the- East Timorese
 are underrepresented in the civil service in East Timor. The Government has made
 some efforts to recruit more civil servants in both East Timor and Irian Jaya, and
 there has been some increase in the number of civil servant trainees for these two
 provinces, despite a "no growth" policy for the civil service as a whole. East Timor-
 ese have expressed concerns that the transmigration program (see Section 1.f.) could
 lead to fewer employment opportunities and might eventually destroy-East Timor's
 cultural identity. The Government stated that the transmigration program in East
 Timor focused mostly on resettlement of Timorese, with a much smaller portion of
 predominantly Christian and Hindu non-Timorese coming in from outside. In the
 last several years, informal, predominantly Muslim migration to the province has
 sparked socioeconomic tension in urban areas, provoking even greater concern than
 the formally sponsored transmigration program. In July in reaction to rumors and
 possible intimidation, at least several thousand non-East Timorese fled the province;
 however, most later returned.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Private sector workers are by law free to form work-
 er organizations without prior authorization, and unions may draw up their own
 constitutions and rules and elect their representatives. In May the Government rati-
 fied ILO Convention 87 on freedom of association and issued a new regulation on
 the registration of workers' organizations. The new regulation eliminates numerical
 and other requirements that were previously a barrier to union registration. It pro-
 vides for registration of unions at the factory, district, provincial, and national level
 and allows unions to form federations and confederations. The regulation prohibits
 unions based on political orientation, religion, gender, or ethnic groups. The regula-
 tion requires that workers' organizations already recognized by the Government,
 i.e., the Federation of All-Indonesian Trade Unions (SPSI) and plant-level unions,
 must reregister within 90 days. Since the new regulation on trade union registration
 went into effect, at least nine new or previously unrecognized unions have begun
 organizing themselves to register.
 The SPSI, which was formed by the fusion (with strong government encourage-
 ment) of existing labor organizations in 1973, is the oldest trade union organization.
 The head of the SPSI and many members of the executive council are also members
 of the ruling GOLKAR political organization and its constituent functional groups.
 In August the SPSI leadership split over the issue of reforming the Federation's
 structure. Following the split, the Department of Manpower stated that it would no
 longer intervene in organizational disputes within trade unions or provide guidance
 to any unions.
 Under the Law on Manpower Affairs enacted in October 1997, workers may form
 unions on the basis of "democratic consultation" with other workers in the same
 company and may join with other unions to form sectoral and intersectoral federa-
 tions. The law was scheduled to take effect on October 1, but in October Parliament
 amended it to postpone implementation until October 1, 2000 to allow time for revi-
 sion, consultation with concerned groups, and preparation of implementing regula-
 tions.
 Although, as with other mass organizations, the Government may dissolve a
 union if it believes that the union is acting against Pancasila, it has never done so,
 and there are no laws or regulations specifying procedures for union dissolution.
 Two labor groups previously considered illegal by the Government, the Indonesian
 Prosperity Trade Union (SBSI) and the Alliance of Independent Journalists, now op-
 erate openly. Since May the AJI, formed in 1994 by journalists disillusioned with
 the government-sanctioned Association of Indonesian Journalists (PWI), has carried
 out its activities without hindrance. The SBSrs founder and general chairman,
 Muchtar Pakpahan, was released after nearly 2 years of detention and cleared of
 all previous charges and convictions in May. However, the SBSI, created in 1992,
 continues to encounter harassment. For example, military and police prevented the
 SBSI from holding a large public rally at the Parliament in June (see Section 2.b.).
 In July the local military commander canceled a meeting between Pakpahan and
 employer representatives in Solo, Central Java. Later the same month, local officials
 broke up an SBSI training session in North Sumatra and assaulted SBSI leaders,
 and security officials beat and detained SBSI representatives in Tangerang (near
 Jakarta) who were seeking to register a workplace SBSI unit with the Department
 
 
 of Manpower office. The SBSI claims that companies are continuing to fire SBSI
 members because of their affiliation with the union or because they sought to orga-
 nize SBSI units within their factories, a problem other labor organizations and ac-
 tivists have encountered in trying to form unions. In addition, SBSI has complained
 of difficulty in registering some of its workplace units.
 Civil servants must belong to KORPRI, a nonunion association whose Central De-
 velopment Council is chaired by the Minister of Home Affairs. State enterprise em-
 ployees, defined to include those working in enterprises in which the State has a
 5-percent holding or greater, usually are required to join KORPRI, but a small num-
 ber of state enterprises have SPSI units. Teachers must belong to the Teachers' As-
 sociation (PGRI). While technically classed as a union, the PGRI continues to func-
 tion more as a welfare organization and does not appear to have engaged in trade
 union activities such as collective bargaining. Mandatory KORPRI and PGRI con-
 tributions are deducted automatically from teachers' salaries.
 The Government announced late in 1995 its intention to relax a regulation requir-
 ing police approval for all meetings of five or more people of all organizations out-
 side offices or normal work sites. However, in practice this regulation continues to
 apply to union meetings. Permission was given routinely to the SPSI, but the SBSI
 and other labor organizations claim that local civilian and security officials on a
 number of occasions have discouraged or denied permission to their gatherings even
 after the union registration process was opened up in May.
 In 1994 the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions lodged a formal
 complaint against Indonesia with the ILO, accusing the Government of denying
 workers the right to set up unions of their own choosing, harassing independent
 workers' organizations, and of taking other actions contrary to ILO standards on
 freedom of association and the right to collective bargaining. In early June, the ILO
 Committee on Freedom of Association stated that the release of Muchtar Pakpahan
 and other SBSI leaders constituted an important and positive step with regard to
 freedom of association, and it expressed the hope that this would be one of a series
 of positive measures toward full respect of freedom of association.
 While Pancasila principles call for labor-management differences to be settled by
 consensus, all organized workers except civil servants have the legal right to strike.
 State enterprise employees and teachers rarely exercise this right, but private sector
 strikes are frequent. Before a strike can occur legally in the private sector, the law
 requires intensive mediation by the Department of Manpower and prior notice of the
 intent to strike. However, no approval is required. In practice, dispute settlement
 procedures rarely are followed, and formal notice of the intent to strike rarely is
 given because Department of Manpower procedures are slow and have little credibil-
 ity with workers. Therefore, sudden strikes tend to result from longstanding griev-
 ances, attempts by employers to prevent the formation of union branches, or denial
 of legally mandated benefits or rights. The Government has stated that it would ad-
 dress strike procedures and industrial dispute resolution in revising the 1997 Law
 on Manpower Affairs and in new legislation on dispute resolution.
 According to Department of Manpower statistics, there were 234 strikes involving
 141,495 workers during 1998. However, beginning in 1997 the Government only
 counted work stoppages in which at least a full day's production was lost as strikes.
 Shorter work stoppages ("unjuk rasa") are more frequent; but the police counted 496
 cases of strikes or other forms of industrial action during the year. The largest
 strike involved an estimated 30,000 workers from a Surabaya manufacturing com-
 pany who went on strike in June, and again in November, for increased wages and
 allowances. One worker died of injuries, reportedly after being struck with a rifle
 butt during a clash with police. After periodic strikes in July involving several thou-
 sand workers at a textile plant in Solo, Central Java, a group of 750 workers dem-
 onstrated for several days in front of the Department of Manpower and other offices
 in Jakarta. Nineteen of the workers were injured in a clash with police when the
 demonstrators blocked traffic on a busy street in Jakarta. They left Jakarta after
 the government Labor Dispute Resolution Board ruled that the company should re-
 instate them. However, the company challenged the ruling in court and refused to
 rehire the workers. In October police fired rubber bullets and beat demonstrating
 workers at a factory near Medan, North Sumatra, after workers began throwing
 stones at the factory and security forces. At least nine workers and two police offi-
 cers were injured. Several other strikes during the year resulted in damage by
 workers to factories.
 The SPSI maintains international contacts but its only international trade union
 affiliation as a federation is the Association of Southeast Asian Nations Trade Union
 Council. Some of the SPSI's federated sectoral unions are members of international
 trade secretariats. The SBSI is affiliated with the World Confederation of Labor and
 some international trade union secretariats.
 
 
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Collective bargaining is pro-
 vided for by law, and the Department of Manpower promotes it within the context
 of the national ideology, Pancasila. Until 1994 only recognized trade unions-the
 SPSI and its components-could legally engage in collective bargaining. Since ratify-
 ing ILO Convention 87 and issuing a new regulation on union registration in May,
 the Government has made it possible for new workers' organizations that register
 with the Government to conclude legally binding ageements with employers.
 In companies without unions, the Government discourages workers from utilizing
 nongovernment outside assistance, e.g., during consultations with employers over
 company regulations. Instead, the Department of Manpower prefers that workers
 seek its assistance and believes that its role is to protect workers. There are credible
 reports that for many companies, consultations are perfunctory at best and usually
 with management-selected workers; there are also credible reports to the contrary
 from foreign companies. According to government statistics, approximately 80 per-
 cent of the factory-level SPSI units have collective bargaining agreements. The de-
 gree to which these agreements are negotiated freely between unions and manage-
 ment without government interference varies. By regulation, negotiations must be
 concluded within 30 days or be submitted to the Department of an ower for medi-
 ation and conciliation or arbitration. Most negotiations are concluded within the 30-
 day period. Agreements are for 2 years and can be extended for 1 year.
 According to NGO's involved in labor issues, in current practice the provisions of
 collective bargaining agreements rarely go beyond the legal minimum standards es-
 tablished by the Government, and the agreements often merely are presented to
 worker representatives for signing rather than being negotiated. The SPSI stated
 in September 1997 that of 23,525 collective bargaining agreements signed between
 employers and workers, 10,776 of these agreements were only "imitation" agree-
 ments because they were concluded in companies where workers were not rep-
 resented by a union. Although government regulations prohibit employers from dis-
 criminating against or harassing employees because of union membership, there are
 credible reports from union officials of employer retribution against union organiz-
 ers, including firing, which is not effectively prevented or remedied in practice.
 Some employers reportedly have warned their employees against contact with union
 organizers.
 Charges of antiunion discrimination are adjudicated by regional and national
 labor dispute resolution committees, and their decisions can be appealed to the
 State Administrative Court. In September 1997, the State Administrative Court re-
 versed a national labor dispute resolution board ruling that ordered the Hong Kong
 Bank to reinstate 166 union members who went on strike, despite government regu-
 lations making it illegal to fire workers solely for striking or other union activity.
 Decisions such as this lead many union members to believe that the dispute resolu-
 tion committees generally side with employers. As a result, workers frequently
 present their grievances directly to the National Human Rights Commission, Par-
 lianient, and NGO's. Administrative decisions in favor of dismissed workers tend to
 be monetary awards; workers are rarely reinstated. The law requires that employers
 obtain the approval of the Labor Dispute Resolution Committee before firing work-
 ers, but the law often is ignored in practice.
 Commenting on antiunion discrimination and restrictions on the right to organize
 and bargain collectively, the ILO's Committee of Experts on the Application of Con-
 ventions and Recommendations in June expressed the hope that the Government
 would take the necessary measures in the very near futre to bring its legislation,
 including the 1997 Manpower Law, into conformity with ILO Convention 98 on the
 right to organize and bargain collectively.
 In 1996 the Minister of Manpower issued a new regulation permitting unions af-
 filiated with the SPSI to collect union dues directly through the checkoff system,
 rather than having the Department of Manpower collect dues and transfer them to
 the SPSI. Implementation of this system remains uneven, but labor observers gen-
 erally believe that it has given more power to factory-level union units where the
 checkoff system is practiced. Union officials at SPSI headquarters stated that not
 all local branches of the unions send a portion of dues collected to regional and cen-
 tral headquarters as provided in the SPSI's bylaws.
 The police, as well as the military, continue to be involved in labor matters, al-
 though since the mid-1990's there has been a shift from open intervention and dem-
 onstrations of force by uniformed troops to less visible measures. Nevertheless, in
 June army troops guarding a steel plant near Jakarta during a strike fred rubber
 bullets on striking workers who pelted them with rocks and bottles. Twenty-three
 workers, as well as 3 soldiers, were injured. On several occasions security personnel
 interfered with activities of the SBSI (see Section 6.a.). However, the most common
 form of military involvement in labor matters, according to union and NGO rep-
 
 
 resentatives, is a longstanding pattern of collusion between police and military per-
 sonnel and employers, which usually takes the form of intimidation of workers by
 security personne in civilian dress. Employer and union representatives also have
 complained about the "invisible costs" of corruption, which they and others estimate
 constitute up to 30 percent of a company's expenses.
 Responding to criticism of Indonesian security force intervention in labor matters
 at the June international labor conference, Minister Idris sent a letter to Coordinat-
 ing Minister for Political and Security Affairs Feisal Tanjung requesting that gov-
 ernment agencies allow labor disputes to be settled in accordance with the law by
 the Department of Manpower. The Coordinating Minister subsequently sent a letter
 to the Minister of Defense and Security and other government departments request-
 ing that they give attention to Idris' request and implement a policy of permitting
 industrial disputes to be resolved between workers and employers on the basis of
 internationally recognized principles. A 1990 decree giving the BAKORSTANAS au-
 thority to intervene in strikes in the interest of political and social stability remains
 in effect.
 Labor law applies in export processing zones (EPZ's) as in the rest of the country,
 although nongovernmental observers believe that in practice enforcement of laws in
 EPZ's is weaker.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The law forbids forced labor, and
 the Government generally enforces it. The Government prohibits forced and bonded
 labor by children but does not always enforce this effectively. There are credible re-
 ports that several thousand children are forced to work on fishing platforms off the
 east coast of North Sumatra in conditions of bonded labor. Most are recruited from
 farming communities, and once they arrive at the work site, miles offshore, they are
 held as virtual prisoners and are not permitted to leave for at least 3 months and
 until a replacement worker can be found. Children receive average monthly wages
 of $17 to $32, well below the regional minimum wage. They live in isolation on the
 sea, work 12 to 20 hours per day in often dangerous conditions, and sleep in the
 workspace with no access to sanitary facilities. There are reports of physical, verbal,
 or sexual abuse of the children. In November 1997, the Department of Manpower
 issued a circular letter having the force of law which prohibits the hiring of persons
 under the age of 14 on fishing platforms. In July Minister Idris told a parliamentary
 committee that the Government wanted to end child labor on the fishing platforms
 and to find alternatives for children employed there. In December Minister Idris
 signed a statement of intent, witnessed by President Habibie and the ILO director
 in Jakarta, committing the Government to ratify the ILO convention prohibiting
 forced labor by no later than June 1999.
 In East Kalimantan a logging company reportedly has trapped Dayak laborers in
 a cycle of debt and turned them into bonded laborers (see Section 5).
 There were reports in 1997 that the military forced villagers to perform uncom-
 pensated labor in Irian Jaya; the military denied such reports (see Section 2.d.).
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment.-Child
 labor exists in both urban and rural areas, and in both the formal and informal sec-
 tors. A survey conducted in 1996 by the Indonesian Child Welfare Association, found
 that 1.92 million children between the ages of 10 and 14 worked at least 4 hours
 a day. The Association believes that this figure represents about 8.5 percent of chil-
 dren. However, the total number of working children is probably significantly higher
 because documents verifying age are falsified easily and because children under age
 10 were not included in the survey. This number is believed to have risen still fur-
 ther due to the 1998 economic crisis. Although statistics are not yet available, it is
 widely agreed that about 2 million children worked at least 4 hours a day in 1998.
 Indonesia was one of the first countries to be selected for participation in the
 ILO's International Program on the Elimination of Child Labor (IPEC), and it
 signed a memorandum of understanding with the ILO in 1992 to guide collaboration
 under this program. The Government and the ILO signed another memorandum of
 understanding on child labor in March 1997, committing them to "promote condi-
 tions to enable the Government to protect working children and progressively pro-
 hibit, restrict and regulate child labor with a view to its ultimate elimination." In
 December Minister Idris signed a statement of intent, witnessed by President
 Habibie and the ILO director in Jakarta, committing the Government to ratify the
 ILO convention on minimum working age no later than June 1999. Although the
 ILO has sponsored training of labor inspectors on child labor matters under the
 IPEC program, enforcement remains lax.
 The Government acknowledges that there is a class of children who must work
 for socioeconomic reasons, and in 1987 the Minister of Manpower issued a regula-
 tion on "Protection of Children Forced To Work." This regulation legalizes the em-
 ployment of children under the age of 14 who must work to contribute to the income
 
 
 936
 of their families. It requires parental consent, prohibits dangerous or difficult work,
 limits work to 4 hours daily, and requires employers to report the number of chil-
 dren working under its provisions. It does not set a minimum age for children in
 this category, effectively superseding the colonial-era government ordinance of 1925
 on "Measures Limiting Child Labor and Nightwork of Women," which is still the
 current law governing child labor and sets a minimum age of 12 for employment.
 The 1987 regulation is not enforced. No employers have been taken to court for vio-
 lating its restrictions on the nature of employment for children, and no reports are
 collected from establishments that employ children.
 Act No. 1 of 1951 was intended to bring into force certain labor measures, includ-
 ing provisions on child labor th  W         those of the 1925 legislation. How-
 ever, implementing reguations for the child labor provisions have never been
 issued. Thus the child aorprvisions in the 1951 Act have no validity. The Gov-
 ernment prohibits forced and bonded labor by children, but does not enforce this
 prohibition effectively (see Section 6.c.).. .
 The 1997 Manpower Law prohibits employers from hiring children under the age
 of 15, except that employers may hire children who are forced for economic reasons
 to work. The new law, which is scheduled to go into effect in 1999, places restric-
 tions similar to those in the 1987 regulation on employers that hire children. It also
 states that adolescents (ages 15 to 17) cannot work during certain hours of the
 nightes,n                   or in jobs that would have anadverse effet on mo-
 rality, such as in entertainment facilities.
 According to government labor force data, most working children work in the agri-
 cultural sector, although the number of working children in urban areas has risen
 significantly with urbanization. A prominent NGO estimated in 1998 that 1.92 mil-
 lion children worked more than 4 hours per day. Of this number, 1.67 million
 worked in rural areas and 249,000 worked f urban areas. According to the NGO's
 estimates, boy workers outnumbered girl workers in the rural areas: 1.01 millon
 boys worked and 662,000 girls worked. By contrast, girls outnumbered boys in the
 urban areas: 119,402 boys worked and 130,000 girls worked.
 More child laborers work in the informal sector than the formal sector. Where
 children work in the formal sector, such work tends to occur on the border line be-
 tween the informal and formal economies, such as alongside their parents in home
 enterprises and on plantations, and in family-owned shops and small factories, par-
 ticularly those that are satellites of large industries. There are children working in
 large factories, although the number is unknown, especially since documents verif-
 ing age are falsified easily. In the informal sector, children sell newspapers, shine
 shoes, help to park or wateh cars, and otherwise earn money. Many children work
 in hazardous conditions as scavengers and garbage pickers, and on fishing platforms
 and fishing boats. One rominent NGO estimated that in 1998, there were 3,200
 children working on ohore fishing platforms, often under adverse conditions.
 Other estimates are higher (see Section 6.c.). Many domestic workers are female
 children under the age of 15. Although accurate figures are unavailable, estimates
 put the number of child domestic workers at up to 1.5 million. Observers agree that
 snumber increased in 1998 as a result of the economic crisis. A survey done in
 1995 revealed that these children work long hours, receive low pay, generally are
 unaware of their rights, and often are far from their families.
 A 1994 law raised compulsory education from 6 to 9 years, but the law has not
 beeniemented fully due to inadequate school facilities and lack of family finan-
 cial resources to support children staying in school. One prominent NGO reported
 that 8 million children had dropped out of primary school after the economic crisis
 began in 1997. Some employers hire children because they are easier than adults
 to manage and tend not to organize or make demands on employers. Children work-
 ing in factories usually work the same number of hours as adults. Children work
 in the rattan and wood furniture industries, the garment industry, the footwear in-
 dustry, food rocessing, and toy making, among others.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-There is no national minimum wage. Rather,
 area wage councils working under the supervision of the National Wage Council es-
 tablish minimum  wages for regions and basic needs figures for each province-a
 monetary amount considered sufficient to enable a single worker to meet the basic
 needs of nutrition, clothing, and shelter. The Government increased the average
 minimum  wage 70 percent (when adjusted for inflation) between 1992 and 1997.
 However, the high inflation rate in 1998 has depressed sharply the purchasing
 power of the minimum  wage. After the latest minimum wage increases in August,
 which averaged 15 percent nationwide, the average minimum wage was equal to 76
 percent of the government-determined "minimum living need," down from 95 per-
 cent in 1997. In Jakarta the monthly minimum wage is about $17 (Rp 198,500).
 There are no reliable statistics on the number of employers paying at least the mini-
 
 
 mum wage. Independent observers' estimates range between 30 and 60 percent. En-
 forcement of minimum wage and other labor regulations remains inadequate, and
 sanctions are light, although the new Manpower Law, which took effect in October
 after revisions were made, increased penaties for not paying the minimum wage
 from about $8 (Rp 100,000) to $17,000 (Rp 200,000,000). According to government
 figures, 57 companies applied for relief from the minimum wage increases on the
 ground that they would otherwise close. The Department of Manpower granted 43
 of the applications and denied the other 14 requests.
 Labor law and ministerial regulations provide workers with a variety of other
 benefits, such as social security, and workers in more modern facilities often receive
 health benefits, free meals, and transportation. The law establishes 7- or 8-hour
 workdays and a 40-hour workweek, with one 30-minute rest period for each 4 hours
 of work.
 The law also requires I day of rest weekly. The daily overtime rate is 11/2 times
 the normal hourly rate for the first hour, and 2 times the hourly rate for additional
 overtime. Regulations allow employers to deviate from the normal work hours upon
 request to the Minister of Manpower and with the agreement of the employee.
 Workers in industries that produce retail goods for export frequently work overtime
 to fulfill contract quotas. Observance of laws regulating benefits and labor standards
 varies from sector to sector and by region. Employer violations of legal requirements
 are fairly common and often result in strikes and employee protests. The Ministry
 of Manpower continues publicly to urge employers to comply with the law. However,
 in general, government enforcement and supervision of labor standards are weak.
 Both law and regulations provide for minimum standards of industrial health and
 safety. In January 1997, the Government announced a new occupational safety and
 health management system under which companies with more than 100 employees
 could obtain public recognition of their compliance with safety and health standards
 by submitting to a safety audit procedure. In the largely Western-operated oil sec-
 tor, safety and health programs function reasonably well. However, in the country's
 100,000 larger registered companies outside the oil sector, the quality of occupa-
 tional health and safety programs varies greatly. The enforcement of health and
 safety standards is hampered severely by the limited number of qualified Depart-
 ment of Manpower inspectors, as well as by the low level of employee appreciation
 for sound health and safety practices. Allegations of corruption on the part of in-
 spectors are common. Workers are obligated to report hazardous working conditions.
 Employers are forbidden by law from retaliating against those who do, but the law
 is not effectively enforced. As a result, workers who remove themselves from hazard-
 ous working conditions may risk loss of employment.
