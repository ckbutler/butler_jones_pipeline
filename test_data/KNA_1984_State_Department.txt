 ST. CHRISTOPHER AND NEVIS
 St. Christopher and Nevis, commonly known as St. Kitts and
 Nevis, is the newest of the English-speaking Eastern Caribbean
 island states. The United Kingdom granted independence to the
 two islands on September 19, 1983. The Constitution
 establishes a parliamentary system of government with
 elections at least every five years. It also provides the
 smaller island of Nevis considerable self-government as well
 as the right to secede from the federation provided that
 certain procedures laid out in the Constitution, including a
 six-month notice, are followed. The new nation's popularly
 elected government is modeled after the British parliamentary
 system. There is an active and vocal political opposition.
 The economic system is mixed. Most commercial enterprises are
 privately owned. However, the sugar industry, which is the
 country's largest, and 85 percent of all arable land are owned
 by state corporations.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 No political killings were reported in 1984.
 b. Disappearance
 No politically motivated abductions, extra-legal detentions or
 disappearances were reported in 1984.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 The authorities abide by the constitutional prohibitions
 against the use of torture or cruel, inhuman, or degrading
 treatment or punishment. Security forces consist of a small
 police force augmented by a tactical reponse unit. Prisoners
 are housed in an outmoded jail; regular visits by family
 members, attorneys, and clergy are permitted.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Constitutional guarantees prohibit arbitrary arrest and
 detention. Habeas corpus provisions require that anf one

 Opposition politicians have made unsubstantiated charges that
 the present Government has been involved in politically
 motivated arrests. There were no reported cases of exile.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The Constitution requires that every person accused of a crime
 receive a fair, speedy, and public trial. The judiciary is
 highly regarded and independent. Like most of the
 English-speaking Caribbean, St. Christopher and Nevis is
 served by the West Indies Court of Appeal. Legal assistance
 is available to indigent defendants.

 private homes.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution guarantees freedom of speech and of the
 press. The country does not have a major daily newspaper.
 Each of the large political parties publishes a weekly or
 biweekly newspaper, and there are regional, church-funded
 newspapers. International news publications are readily
 available. Opposing viewpoints are freely debated on the
 television station which the Government owns and operates, and
 spokesmen for various organizations air their views on the
 commercial radio station.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Constitution guarantees the right of peaceful assembly.
 Organized demonstrations, rallies, and public meetings
 sponsored by political parties occur regularly without

 union members.

 Travel inside and outside of the federation is unrestricted.
 Citizens resident in other countries are free to return at any

 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 The multi-party political system encompasses a wide variety of
 political views. The minimum voting age is 18. Political
 parties are free to conduct their activities, and every party
 holds some type of annual convention.
 The present Government is a coalition of two of the country's
 three major political parties: the People's Action Movement,
 led by Prime Minister Dr. Kennedy A. Simmonds, and the Nevis
 Reformation Party, headed by Simeon Daniel, the Premier of
 Nevis and Minister of Natural Resources and Environment. In
 the June 1984 national elections, this coalition won a
 strengthened mandate by taking nine of the eleven elected
 seats in the Federal Parliament.

 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights

 ST. CHRISTOPHER AND NEVIS
 Internationally recognized human rights organizations have not
 commented on the human rights situation, nor has anyone
 requested an investigation or called for inquiries into
 alleged violations. The Government is firmly committed to the
 promotion of human rights and is sensitive to any criticism
 related to this issue. Freedom House in 1983 rated St. Kitts
 and Nevis 'free*; Amnesty International did not have a section
 on the country in its 1984 report.
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 The economy is emerging from a period of decline. Beginning
 in 1981, with the worldwide recession coupled with falling
 sugar prices, the economy of the country stagnated and total
 revenues needed for capital development projects fell by 13
 percent. The gross domestic product [GDP] was estimated at
 $45 million in 1983 or approximately $920 per capita.
 The Government has developed a program of economic
 diversification to increase earnings in tourism,
 manufacturing, and agricultural production other than sugar.
 The sugar industry remains the single most important revenue
 producer in the economy. It accounted for 17 percent of the
 GDP in 1983.
 The population, estimated at 44,000, has one of the lowest
 growth rates in the area, averaging 0.3 in 1984. The birth
 rate is 29 per thousand; while infant mortality rate remains
 high at 41.3 per thousand live births.
 The role of women is not restricted by law and it was boosted
 in the June 1984 election in which Constance Mitcham won a
 seat in Parliament, defeating the leader of the opposition.
 Ms. Mitcham was then named Minister of Women's Affairs.
