 MALTA
 Malta is a constitutional republic and parliamentary democracy. The Head of
 State (President) appoints as the Head of Government (Prime Minister) the leader
 of the party that gains a plurality of seats in the quinquennial elections for the uni-
 cameral legislature.
 The police are commanded by a civilian commissioner under the effective super-
 vision of the Government.
 The economy is a mixture of state-owned and private industry, with tourism and
 light manufacturing as the largest sectors, and it provides residents a moderate to
 high standard of living.
 The Government is strongly committed to human rights. An independent judiciary
 upholds the Constitution's protections for individual rights and freedoms. Cultural
 and religious patterns reinforce the homogeneity of society. Societal discrimination
 against women persists, and domestic violence is a problem.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extra judicial Killing.-There were no reports of political or
 other extrajudicial killings.
 On October 26, Fathi Shiqaqi, a leader of the Palestinian group, Islamic Jihad,
 was shot and killed in Sliema.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment-
 The Constitution prohibits inhuman or degrading punishment or treatment. There
 were no reports that officials employ them.
 Prison conditions meet minimal international standards, and the Government per-
 mits visits by human rights monitors.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution and law provide for
 freedom from arbitrary arrest, detention, or exile, and the Government observes this
 prohibition The police may arrest a person for questioning on the basis of reason-
 able suspicion but within 48 hours must either release the suspect or lodge charges.
 Arrestedprsons have no right to legal counsel during this 48 hour period. Persons
 incarcerated pending trial are granted access to counsel. Bail is normally granted.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The judiciary is independent of the executive and
 legislative branches. The Chief Jusice and nine judges are appointed by the Presi-
 dent on the advice of the Prime Minister. There is a civil court, a commercial court,
 and a criminal court. In the latter, the presiding judge sits with a jury of nine. The
 Court of Appeal hears appeals from decisions of the civil and commercial courts. The
 Court of Criminal Appeal hears appeals from judgments of conviction by the crimi-
 nal court. The highest court, the Constitutional Court, hears appeals in cases involv-
 
 
 ing violations of human rights, interpretation of the Constitution, and invalidity of
 laws. It also has jurisdiction in cases concerning disputed parliamentary elections
 and electoral corrupt practices. There are also inferior courts presided over by a
 magistrate.
 The Constitution requires a fair public trial before an impartial court. Defendants
 have the right to counsel of their choice, or (if they cannot pay the cost) to court-
 a ppointed counsel at public expense. Defendants ex a presumption of innocence.
 They may confront witnesses, present evidence, and have the right of appeal,
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution protects privacy of the home and prohibits electronic surveillance. The
 Government respects these provisions. Police officers with the rank of inspector and
 above may issue search warrants based on perceived reasonable grounds for sus-
 picion of wrongdoing.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech
 and the press, and the Government respects these rights in practice. However, the
 1987 Foreign Interference Act bans foreign participation in local politics during the
 period leading up to elections. An independent press, an effective judiciary, and a
 functioning democratic political system combine to ensure freedom of speech and of
 the press, including academic freedom. One biweekly, three daily, and seven weekly
 newspapers freely express diverse views. Two government-owned television stations,
 an opposition party television station, a commercial cable network, and eight private
 radio stations also function freely.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 the right of peaceful assembly, and the Government respects this right in practice.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the
 Government respects this right in practice. The state-supported religion is Roman
 Catholicism. The Government grants subsidies only to Roman Catholic schools. Stu-
 dents in government schools may opt to decline instruction in Roman Catholicism.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Government does not restrict arbitrarily movement within the
 country, foreign travel, or emigration. A court order may prohibit the departure
 from the country of anyone who is the subject of a formal complaint alleging
 nonfulfillment of an obligation, such as nonpayment of a debt or nonsupport of an
 estranged spouse.
 Since 1992 the Government has granted temporary refugee status to over 1,000
 persons, pending their relocation abroad, and cooperates with the U.N. High dom-
 missioner for Refugees. The Government expels or repatriates persons it deems to
 be economic refugees.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens exercise this right in multiparty, secret-ballot elections held every 5 years
 on the basis of universal suffrage for those 18 years of age or over. In the 1992 elec-
 tion 96 percent of the electorate voted.
 Women are underrepresented in government and politics.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Various human rights organizations and persons interested in promoting and pro-
 tecting human rights operate freely. The Government places no restrictions on in-
 vestigations by international human rights groups.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution and law prohibit discrimination based on sex. The Government
 respects tis prhibition
 WomenThere is no widespread pattern of family violence against women, but
 continuing reports of such incidents have made plain that the problem exists. A spe-
 cial police unit and several voluntary organizations provide support to victims of o-
 mestic violence. For women who are threatened or physically abused, the Govern-
 ment also maintains an emergency fund and subsidizes a shelter.
 Prostitution is a serious offense under Maltese law, and heavy penalties are re-
 served for organizers. Rape and violent indecent assault carry sentences of up to 10
 years. The law treats spousal rape the same as any other rape. Divorce and abortion
 are not legal.

 The Constitution provides that all citizens have access, on a nondiscriminatory
 basis, to housing, employment, and education. While women constitute a growing
 portion of the work force, they are underrepresented in management. Cultural and
 traditional employment patterns often direct them either into traditional "women s
 jobs" (such as sales clerk, secretary, bank teller, teacher, or nurse) or into more re-
 warding jobs in family owned businesses or select professions (i.e. academia or medi-
 cine). Therefore, women generally earn less than their male counterparts, and many
 leave employment upon marriage. The Government's Department of Equal Status
 of Women and women's rights groups actively address women's issues. Legislation
 enacted in 1993 granted women equality in matters of family law, and a 1991 con-
 stitutional amendment committed the Government to promoting equal rights for all
 persons regardless of sex. Redress in the courts for sexual discrimination is avail-
 able.
 Children.-The Government has expressed concern for children's rights and wel-
 fare but addresses those concerns within the context of family law. Although sen-
 sitive to children's rights, Parliament has failed to pass specific legislation to protect
 children's rights. The number of reported cases of child abuse has grown as public
 awareness has increased, but it is not clear whether the actual number of incidents
 has increased.
 People With Disabilities.-The law protects the rights of the disabled. The 1969
 Employment of Disabled Persons Act led to greater employment of disabled persons
 in government agencies. The 1992 Structures Act requires accessibility to public
 buildings for people with physical disabilities. Overall government and private sec-
 tor efforts to advance the status of disabled persons have been uneven.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Workers have the right to associate freely and to
 strike and the Government respects these rights in practice. Only noncivilian per-
 sonnel of the armed forces and police are prohibited from striking. There are 24 reg-
 istered trade unions, representing about 50 percent of the work force.
 Although all unions are independent of political parties, the largest, the General
 Workers'-Union, is generally regarded as having close informal ties with the Labor
 Party. There is no prohibition on unions affiliating internationally.
 Under the Industrial Relations Act of 1976, the responsible minister may refer
 labor disputes either to the Industrial Tribunal (a government-appointed body con-
 sisting of representatives of government, employers, and employee groups) or to
 binding arbitration. The International Labor Organization Committee of Experts ob-
 jects to a provision of the Act that permits compulsory arbitration to be held at the
 request of only one of the parties, but neither unions nor employers appear to object
 to this provision. In practice, a striking union can ignore an unfavorable decision
 of the Tribunal by continuing the strike on other grounds. No disputes were referred
 to the Tribunal in 1995.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Workers are free, in law and
 practice, to organize and bargain collectively. Unions and employers meet annually
 with government representatives to work out a comprehensive agreement regulating
 industrial relations and income policy.
 Under the Industrial Relations Act, an employer may not take action against any
 employee for participation or membership in a trade union. Complaints may be pur-
 sued through a court of law, through a tripartite (union-employer-government) tri-
 bunal, or through the Commission Against Injustices (a gvernment-a pointed body
 composed of representatives of the Government and the opposition); but most dis-
 putes are resolved directly between the parties. Workers fired solely for union activi-
 ties must be reinstated.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Constitution bans forced
 labor, and it does not occur.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The law prohibits employment of
 children younger than age 16. This is generally respeted, but there is some employ-
 ment of underae children during summer months, especially as domestics, res-
 taurant kitchen help, or vendors. The Department of Labor enforces the law effec-
 tively but is lenient in cases of summer employment of underage youths in busi-
 nesses run by their families.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The legal minimum wage, $117 (40.38 Malta
 liri) per week, provides a decent standard of living for a worker and family with
 the addition of government subsidies for housing, health care, and free education.
 Wage Councils, composed of representatives of government, business, and unions,
 regulate workhours; for most sectors the standard is 40 hours per week, but in some
 trades it is 43 or 45 hours per week.
 
 
 949
 Government regulations prescribe a daily rest period, which is normally I hour.
 The law mandates an annual paid vacation of 4 workweeks plus 4 workdays. The
 Department of Labor effectively enforces these requirements.
 Enforcement of the 1994 Occupational Health and Safety (Promotion) Act is un-
 even, and industrial accidents remain frequent.
