 IRAN*
 The Islamic Republic of Iran was established in 1979 after a populist revolution
 toppled the monarchy. The Government is dominated by Shi'a Muslim clergy. Aya-
 tollah Ali Khamenei is the Leader of the Islamic Revolution and functions as the
 Chief of State. He is also the Commander-in-Chief of the armed forces. President
 Ali Akbar Hashemi-Rafsaojani, first elected in a popular vote in 1989 and reelected
 in 1993, is constitutionally barred from a third term. The Constitution provides for
 a 270-seat unicameral Islamic Consultative Assembly, or Majles. The Government
 seeks to ensure that public policy is consistent with its view of political and socio-
 religious values, but some serious differences exist within the leadership. The au-
 thoritarian government maintains its power through widespread repression and in-
 timidation. The judiciary is subject to government and religious influence.
 Several agencies share responsibility for internal security, including the Ministry
 of Intelligence and Security, the Ministry of Interior, and the Revolutionary Guards,
 a military force established after the revolution and coequal with the regular mili-
 tary. Paramilitary volunteer forces known as Hezbollahis or Basijis conduct vigi-
 lante actions. Both regular and paramilitary security forces commit numerous and
 serious human rights abuses.
 Iran has a mixed economy. The Government owns the petroleum and utilities in-
 dustries and the banks. Oil exports are the primary source of foreign exchange. The
 economy has not yet recovered from the disruptions of the 1979 revolution and the
 destruction from the Iran-Iraq war. Iran's isolation from international financial
 markets has decreased slightly, but remains a problem. Economic performance is
 adversely affected by corruption and government mismanagement. Unemployment
 in 1996 was estimated at 30 percent, and inflation was about 50 percent.
 The Government's human rights record remains poor; there was no evidence of
 significant human rights improvement during the year. Systematic abuses include
 extrajudicial killings and summary executions; disappearances; widespread use of
 torture and other degrading treatment; harsh prison conditions; arbitrary arrest and
 detention; lack of fair trials; infringement on citizens' privacy rights; and restriction
 of the freedoms of speech, press, assembly, association, religion, and movement. The
 Government represses political dissidents and the ruling clerics effectively control
 the electoral process, thereby denying citizens the right to change their government.
 Women face legal and social discrimination, and the Government discriminates
 against minorities and restricts important worker rights. Although a lively debate
 on political, economic, and social issues occurred during the parliamentary election
 campaign this year, freedom of expression remained firmly under government con-
 trol and became more severely restricted in the wake of the parliamentary elections.
 The Government closed several newspapers, disqualified candidates, barred speak-
 ers, and intimidated opposition gatherings by encouraging Hezbollahi attacks.
 However, the Government did allow the first visit in 5 years of the United Na-
 tions Human Rights Commission (UNHRC) Special Rapporteur on Human Rights
 in Iran. Canadian Maurice Copithorne, the newly appointed Special Rpprteur, vis-
 ited Iran from February 10 to 16. The Special Rapporteur heard credible reports of
 abuses including: Inhuman or degrading treatment and punishment; arbitrary ar-
 rests, imprisonments, and executions; unfair judicial practices; and disregard for
 freedom of expression and religion. Human Rights Watch (HRW) and the UNHRC
 Special Rapporteur reported that the Government was generally cooperative during
 their visits, However, the Government continues to deny the universality of human
 rights and attempts to discredit critics. For example, in one Iranian press report
 the chief of Evin prison described human rights inspectors as "sick" people who filed
 misleading and untruthful reports. The U.N. Special Rapporteur for Religious Free-
 dom and the U.N. Special Rapporteur for the Freedom of Expression also traveled
 to Iran in 1996. In November the UNHRC continued the mandate of its Special
 Rapporteur.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-Most executions in political trials
 amount to summary executions because basic procedural safeguards are lacking. In
 his 1995 report, the U.N. Special Rapporteur on Extrajudicial, Summary, or Arbi-
 trary Executions noted "the persistent allegations of violations of the right to life
 *The United States does not have an embassy in Iran. This report draws heavily on non-U.S.
 Government sources.
 
 
 1257
 
 in the Islamic Republic of Iran." Although the domestic press stopped reporting
 most executions as of 1992, executions appear to continue in substantial numbers.
 Amnesty International (AI) reported that at least 110 persons were executed in
 1996, a substantial increase over the previous year's total of 50 executions. Inhuman
 punishments are used in some cases, including two cases of stoning (see Section
 1.c.). Those executed included Mehrdad Kalany, who was executed on June 22 on
 charges that included "meeting and talking" with Reynaldo Galindo Pohl, the former
 U.N. Special Representative, and the delegation that accompanied him. Also on
 June 22, Ahned Bakhtiari, a member of the Iranian People's Fedaian Organization
 (Minority), was executed on charges of participation in a terrorist group and terror-
 ist operations, as well as other criminal charges. Rabman Radjabi Hamvand, a
 meber of the Kurdish Democratic Party of Iran, was executed on July 28. The
 charges against him stemmed from a complaint by a private individual that was
 later withdrawn. Al reported that Hedayatollah Zendehdel and Abolghasem Maid-
 Abkahi were believed to have been hanged at the end of the year, after 7 years' de-
 tention without trial and conviction on mainly political charges.
 Exiles and human rights monitors report that many of those executed for alleged
 criminal offenses, primarily narcotics charges, were actually political dissidents. In
 addition a November 1995 law criminalized dissent and applied the death penalty
 to offenses such as "attempts against the security of the State, outrage against high-
 ranking Iranian officials, and insults against the memory of Imam Khomeini, and
 against the Leader of the Islamic Republic."
 The Government continued its repression of the Sunni minority, both inside and
 outside Iran. On January 28, a 50-year-old Sunni cleric, Molawi Ahamed Sayyad,
 imprisoned by the Government from 1990-95, disappeared at Bandar Abbas airport.
 His body was found in a suburb of the city on February 2. Allegedly, six menbers
 of the Revolutionary Guards arrested him at the airport; he is believed to have died
 in their custody. In early March, 46-year-old Molavi Abdul Malek, a Sunni cleric
 and Iranian Balouch leader, was reportedly killed by Iranian intelligence operatives
 in Karachi. Also reported killed in a related incident were Iranian Sunni Molavi
 Abdulmalek, the son of a prominent Iranian Sunni cleric, and Jamshid Zahi, an-
 other Iranian Sunni leader.
 In December clashes erupted in Bakhtaran at a funeral after mourners accused
 the Government of killing Mohammad Rabil, a Sunni prayer leader. Officials said
 that Rabil died of a heart attack. It is unclear whether any persons were killed in
 the rioting.
 The Government also continued to kill political opponents abroad. Opposition
 leaders Zahrah Rajabi and Abdul Ali Moradiwere killed in Istanbul by agents of
 the Government on February 20. In Iraq eight members of the Kurdish :Democratic
 Party of Iran were killed by elements of the Revolutionary Guards. The victims
 were: Ghafour Mehdizadeh; All Amini; and Saddig Abdulahi, who were killed on De-
 cember 27, 1995 in Koya; Usman Ruyan and Abubaker Rahimi, who were killed on
 December 30, 1995 in Arbil; Rahman Schabannajad and Ali Abdulah, who were
 killed on January 2 in Suleimanya; and Cheder Mahmudi, who was killed in No-
 vember 1995 in Suleimanya. In May a former official from the Shah's regime, Reza
 Masluman, was killed in Paris. The murder is believed to have been ordered by the
 Government.
 Investigations of state-sponsored terrorism abroad continued in 1996. For example
 the trial of Kazem Darabi, an Iranian charged with murdering four Iranian Kurdish
 dissidents in Berlin in 1992 allegedly under instructions from the Iranian Govern-
 ment, continued in Germany. In November the German prosecutor stated that Ira-
 nian Head of State Ayatollah Khameini and President Rafsanjani were responsible
 for the murders. Iran responded by threatening the German embassy in Tehran, the
 German judiciary, and political and economic ties with Germany. In France a
 French prosecutor accused Iranian chief of intelligence Ali Fallahian of ordering a
 killing, and in Germany a warrant was issued for Falahian's arrest.
 The Government took no action to repudiate the religious ruling (fatwa), or its re-
 lated bounty, calling for the death of Salman Rushdie and anyone associated with
 publishing his book, "The Satanic Verses" (see Section 2.a.).
 b. Disppearance-No reliable information is available on the number of dis-
 appearances. In the period immediately following arrest, many detainees are held
 incommunicado.
 In early November, Faraj Sarkuhi, a magazine editor who had been critical of the
 Government, disappeared while traveling to Germany where his wife and children
 reside. His wife accused the Government of abducting him in Tehran. Sarkuhi re-
 appeared in late December and held a press conference at the Tehran airport where
 he said that he had been in Germany but had not contacted his wife, with whom
 he was having problems. The German Government stated that he had not entered
 
 
 1258
 Germany, and the press speculated that the Government had forced Sarkuhi to give
 a false account of his whereabouts.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Credible reports indicate that security forces continue to torture detainees and pris-
 oners. Common methods include suspension for long periods in contorted positions,
 burning with cigarettes, and, most frequently, severe and repeated beatings with ca-
 bles or other instruments on the back and on the soles of the feet. A new law en-
 tered into force on July 10 that reinforces Islamic punishments such as flogging,
 stoning, amputations, and public executions. Two persons were stoned to death,
 while two others were executed after receiving lashes.
 Prison conditions are harsh. Some prisoners are held in solitary confinement or
 denied adequate rations or medical care in order to force confessions. Female pris-
 oners have reportedly been raped or otherwise tortured while in detention. In the
 past, prison guards have intimidated the family members of detainees and have
 sometimes tortured detainees in their presence. The UNHRC Special Rapporteur
 met privately with detainee Abbas Amir Entezam, a former deputy minister in the
 government of Prime Minister Mehdi Bazargan. Amir Entezam reported that the
 conditions in Evin prison improved after 1989, but that political prisoners were still
 housed with violent criminals and denied regular family visits. Some prisoners, who
 met with former U.N. Special Representative Galindo Pohl during his last visit in
 1991, complained of reprisals. Amir Entezam claimed that he was beaten so exten-
 sively that he lost the hearing in his left ear.
 The Government does not permit unrestricted to imprisoned dissidents by human
 rights monitors. The U.N. Special Rapporteur was not able to see all the dissidents
 he asked to see.
 In September 1994, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) issued
 a report on "unresolved humanitarian issues" from the Iran-Iraq war. The ICRC
 noted that the Government failed to identify combatants killed in action and failed
 to exchange information on those killed or missing. The report criticized the Govern-
 ment for obstructing ICRC efforts to register and repatriate prisoners of war.
 Throughout 1996 the Governments of Iran and Iraq made little progress in resolving
 the issue of those missing in action.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Although the Constitution prohibits arbi-
 trary arrest and detention, there is reportedy no legal time limit on incommunicado
 detention, nor any judicial means to determine the legality of detention. Suspects
 may be held for questioning in jails or in local Revolutionary Guard offices.
 The security forces often do not inform family members of a prisoner's welfare and
 location. Even if these circumstances are known, the prisoner still may be denied
 visits by family and legal counsel. In addition, families of executed prisoners do not
 always receive notification of the prisoner's death. Those that do receive such infor-
 mation may be forced to pay the Government to retrieve the body of their relative.
 Although the Government claimed to have released Abbas Amir Entezam early
 in 1996, he is still detained. Initially arrested in 1979 on charges of espionage and
 condemned to life in prison, he is now held in a "security house.
 Adherents of the Baha'i faith continue to face arbitrary arrest and detention. The
 Government appears to adhere to a practice of detaining a small number of Baha'is
 at any time.
 The Government does not use forced exile, but many dissidents leave Iran because
 they feel threatened.
 e. Denial of Fair Public TriaL-The traditional court system is not independent
 and is subject to government and religious influence.
 Iran has two court systems: The traditional courts, which adjudicate civil and
 criminal offenses; and the Islamic Revolutionary Courts, established in 1979 to try
 political offenses, narcotics crimes, and "crimes against God."
 Many aspects of the prerevolution judicial system survive in the civil and criminal
 courts. For example defendants have the right to a public trial, may choose their
 own lawyer, and have the right of appeal. Trials are adjudicated by panels ofjudges.
 There is no jury system. In the absence of postrevolution laws, the Government ad-
 vises judges to base their decisions on Islamic law. These courts are not independ-
 ent. The Revolutionary Courts may consider cases normally in the jurisdiction of the
 civil and criminal courts, and also may overturn their decisions. Assignment of cases
 to either system of courts appears haphazard. The Supreme Court has limited au-
 thority to review cases.
 Trials in the Revolutionary Courts are not fair. Often, pretrial detention is pro-
 longed and defendants lack access to attorneys. When legal help is available, attor-
 neys are rarely given time to prepare an effective defense. Indictments are often for
 vague offenses such as "antirevolutionary behavior," "moral corruption," and "siding
 with global arrogance." Defendants do not have the right to confront their accusers
 
 
 1259
 
 or to appeal. Secret or summary trials of 5 minutes are common. Others are show
 trials intended to highlight a coerced public confession.
 The Government often charges members of religious minorities with crimes rather
 than apostasy. Ayatollah Mohammad Yazdi, the head of the judiciary, stated in May
 that Baha'ism was an espionage organization rather than a religion. On February
 18, the Iranian court confirmed death sentences for two Baha'is, Kayvan
 Khalajabadi and Bilmam Mithaqi. When they were sentenced in 1993, an Iranian
 member of the U.N. Human Rights Commission stated that they were sentenced to
 death not because they were Baha'is, but because they were spies (see Sections 2.c.
 and 5). In July a Muslim convert to Christianity was arrested on charges of espio-
 nage (see Section 2..).
 In 1995 the Government began implementing a law authorizing judges to act as
 prosecutor and judge in the same case. The rights of defendants are further eroded
 by the fact that many judges retired after the revolution, and others were disbarred
 for ideological reasons. The Government has replaced them with judges who are re-
 gaddas politically acceptable to the regime. ah lws effect was clear to the U.N.
 gpca Rapporteur when he viewed a 45-minute session of a trial. He wrote in his
 reprt: "The judge was clearly not a neutral third party between the prosecution
 and the defense.
 In June the Government requested technical assistance in training judges and ad-
 ministering prisons from the UNHCR, and from the UN. Crime Prevention and
 Justice Branch.
 No estimates are available on the number of political prisoners. However, the
 Government often arrests persons on questionable criminal charges, usualiy drug
 trafficking or espionage, wen their actual "offenses" areitical. In October 1994,
 the U.N. Special Rapporteur issued a report that noted tat he had requested the
 Government to provide information on 78 reported political prisoners.
 f. Arbitray Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution states that "reputation, life, property, (and) dwelling(s)" are protected
 from trespass except as "provided by law." However, security forces enter homes and
 offices, monitor telephone conversations, and open mail withbout court authorization.
 Paramilitary volunteer forces, including the basijis and hizbollahis, and other se-
 curity forces monitor the social activities of citizens. Such neanizations may harass
 or arrest women whose clothing does not cover the hair and alf ofthe body except
 the hands and face, or those who wear makeup. Enforcement varies with the politi-
 cal climate and the jurisdiction.
 There were increasing reports of hizbollahi violence. Incidents included attacks on
 young people believed to be too foreign in their dress or activities. Reports indicate
 that the hizbollahi more frequently invaded private homes and intervened on the
 streets. They also disrupted memorial services for prominent literary figures. There
 are reports of several deaths resulting from these incidents. There have been other
 reports that hizbllahi or basiji question and abuse unmarried couples. Women have
 also been beaten if caught without proper clothing in public or in private houses
 when men are present.
 In the past, prison guards have intimidated family members of detainees (see Sec-
 tion 1.c.). Iranian opposition figures living abroad have reported harassment of their
 relatives in Iran.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for the freedom of the
 press, except when published ideas are 'contrary to Islamic principles, or are det-
 rime ntal to public rights." In practice the Government restricts freedom of speech
 and the press. The Government exerts strong control over most media, particularly
 publications. Some  newspapers are associated with factions in the Government.
 They reflct different views and criticize the Government, but are prohibited from
 criticizing the concept of Islamic government or promoting the rights of ethnic mi-
 norities.
 The U. Special Representative for Freedom of Opinion and Expression, Abid
 Hussain, visited Iran from January 6 to 10. He reported significant problems: The
 strong connection between adherence to the Government's version of Islam and the
 right to freedom of opinion and expression. He noted that the vagueness of criteria
 determining what forms of expression are allowable under Islamic law hampers free
 expression and also reported limits on women's right to free expression. He pointed
 out that the Government ,generally fails to conde       u strongly and unequivocally"
 both threats and the use of violence "by irregular groups of private persons against
 professionals in the field of information." He expressed concern that prominent
 members of the Government defend and encourage the hizbollahi in these attacks,
 and that no court cases have been brought against the hizbollahi.
 
 
 1260
 The Government continued its heavy-handed censorship of the press. Iranian pub-
 lisher and writer Abdolkarim Soroush again left Iran after continuing harassment
 by the Government and hizbollahi. In Way a band of hizbollahi prevented Soroush
 from speaking at Amir Kabir University in Tehran.
 Another influential writer, Abbas Maroufi, publisher of the now defunct magazine,
 Gardoun, was sentenced to 35 lashes and 6 months in prison for "publishing lies"
 after printing a survey stating that many Iranians are psychologically depressed. He
 was also convicted of"insulting the Leader of the Islanic Republic for publishing
 an article comparing the Shah and Ayatollah Khamenei.
 In January publisher Ablhassem Golbaf of the monthly magazine, Gouzarish,
 was sentenced to 3 months in prison for publishing a negative story on a state-
 owned fertilizer company. Under the press law, only the Ministry of Culture and
 Islamic Guidance may bring cases against a publisher or writer;, however, the case
 against Golbaf was broughtby the Minister of Agriculture.
 The U.N. Special Rapporteur reported that several newspapers were closed by the
 authorities and   T t he editor ofKinyan, a publication critcal of government poli-
 es, was chiarged with ,publishing false information and "weakening the foundation
 of the Islamic Republic.   n
 The Special Rapporteur also reported that the authorities broke up an informal
 gathering of writers protesting the intolerant atmosphere, threatening that if such
 meetings were held again, those involved would be detained.
 The Government owns all broadcasting facilities, and their programming reflects
 its political and socio-religious ideology. In the fall, a new television program
 "Hovigat" (Identity) was launched. The program's apparent aim is to categorize tar-
 geted intellectual a ol misfits or foreign spies.
 Government censorship extends to the film industry. Any cinema showing films
 not considered acceptable is vuinerable to hizbellahi attacks. In early June, a group.
 of hizbllahi attacked the audience and employees of the Qods cinema because it
 played a movie in which a man appeared in women's clothing. Several persons were
 reported injured, including a pregnant woman.
 The Mimstry of Islam'c Culture and Guidance is also charged with ensuring that
 books do not contain osffensive material prior to publication. The Ministry inspects
 foreign printed materials prior to their release on the market. However, some books
 and pamphlets critical oft te Government are published without reprisal.
 The Government made no effort to repudiate the 1989 religious decree condemn-
 ing to death British author Salman Rushdie for his book, "The Satanic Verses,"
 which the Government considers blasphemous. Nor did the Government move to re-
 pudiate its promise of a cash award to any person who kills Rushdie or anyone asso-
 cated with publishing his book. According to press reports, senior government offi-
 cials declared that the Government would not take steps to enforce the decree. How-
 ever, Ayatollah Yazdi, head of the Iranian judiciary, stated that the decree "applies
 to all Muslims and would eventually be carried out one day."
 In the fall the authorities began rigorously enforcing the ban on satellite dishes.
 Many were seized and others were removed and hidden by their owners. The press
 speculated that the crackdown was related to the debut of a television program fea-
 turig popular Iranian performers that was broadcast by the Voice of America.
 Academic censorship persists. In his interim report the UNHRC Special Rep-
 resentative noted the existence of a campaign to bring about the "Islamization of
 peron Rw        o fih
 the universities," which seemed to be a movement to urge ftss"h     o ih
 against the sanctities of the Islamic system." The deputyean o  e law school at
 the University of Tehran, Dr. Javad Tabatabai, was dismissed after criticizing a
 1994 law reorganizing the country's court system.
 Government informers are said to be common on university campuses and mon-
 itr classroom material. Admission to universities is politicized; all applicants must
 pass "charactr tests" in which officials screen out applicants critical of the Govern-
 ent's ideology. To achieve tenure, professors must cooperate with government au-
 thorities over a period of years.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Assoation.- The Constitution permits as-
 semblies and marches "provided they do not violate the principles of Islam." In prac-
 tice, the Government restricts freedom of assembly. Oppositionists tried to hold
 press conferences about the election on January 2 and again on January 31. The
 police broke up both meetings, first claiming they could not garantee security for
 he event and then stating that the conference was sponsored by an illegal organiza-
 tion. The UNHCR Special Rapporteur also norted the tenden of government police
 and military forces not to intervene when unofficial groups attempted to break up
 opposition or cultural gatherings. The press reported significant antigovernent un-
 rest in the western city of Kerbanshah following the death of a Kurdish Sunni Mus-
 lim cleric in early December. Protests over the next week were violently suppressed
 
 
 1261
 by security forces resulting in several deaths, many persons injured, and perhaps
 hundreds arrested.
 The Constitution provides for the establishment of political parties, professional
 associations, and religious groups provided that they do not violate the principles
 of "freedom, sovereignty, and national unity," or question Islam or the Islamic Re-
 public. In practice, most independent organizations are banned, co-opted by the Gov-
 ernment, or moribund.
 In 1995 the Ministry of Interior refused to grant a license to the Freedom Move-
 ment, a political group founded in 1961 and declared illegal in 1991. The Ministry
 decision effectively precluded the party from participating in the March Majles elec-
 tions. No major opposition faction was represented in the elections. In the north-
 western city of Bonab, demonstrations against the Government's handling of the
 elections were forcibly broken up, resulting in the deaths of a number of persons.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution declares that the 'official religion of
 Iran is Islam and the sect followed is Ja'fari Shi'ism:. It also states that 'other Is-
 lamic denominations shall enjoy complete respect." However, the Government re-
 stricts freedom of religion. The Government is profoundly influenced by Shi'a Islam.
 The President and many top officials, including the Speaker of the Parliament and
 many parliamentary deputies, are Shi'a clergymen.
 Approximately 90 percent of the population are Shi'a Muslims. Aside from slightly
 over 1 percent who are not Muslims, the rest of the population are Sunni Muslims,
 drawn largely from Kurdish, Arab, Turkoman, Baluchi, and other ethnic minorities.
 The Constitution also recognizes Christianity, Judaism, and Zoroastrianism.
 Members of these religions elect representatives to reserved Parliamentary seats.
 They are free to practice their religion and instruct their children, but the Govern-
 ment interferes with the administration of their schools. Harassment by government
 officials is common (see Section 5).
 Non-Muslims may not proselytize Muslims. Oppression of evangelical Christians
 increased in 1996. In early July, a Muslim convert, Sharam Sepehri-Fard, was ar-
 rested on charges of having "sensitive information." He has been denied visitors
 since shortly after his arrest, and his condition is unknown. In late September, an-
 other Muslim convert to evangelical Christianity, Pastor Mohammed Yussefi (also
 known as Ravanbaksh), was reportedly murdered by authorities. Yussefi had been
 imprisoned by the Government on several occasions prior to his death. Three mem-
 bers of the opposition movement Mojahadin-e-Khaleq (MEK), Farohnaz Anami,
 Betoul Vaferi Kalateh, and Maryam Shahbazpoor, are currently in prison for the
 1994 murder of Reverend Tatavous Michaelian, an evangelical Protestant pastor.
 The three women claim that two other Christian pastors murdered in 1994, Rev-
 erend Mehdi Dibaj and Reverend Haik Hovsepian Mehr, were also killed by the
 MEK.
 The Government regards the Baha'i community, the largest non-Muslim minority
 with 300,000 to 350,000 members, as a "misguided sect." It prohibits Baha'is from
 teaching and practicing their faith or maintaining links with coreligionists abroad.
 Recently, Baha'i youth have been denied admittance to the fourth year of high
 school. Universities continue to deny admittance to Baha'i students. In addition,
 Baha'i are regularly denied compensation for injury or criminal victimization. Gov-
 ernment authorities claim that only Muslim plaintiffs are eligible for compensation.
 In October 1993, the Majles approved legislation  a  rohibits government work-
 ers from membership in groups that deny the "divine religions." The Government
 uses such terminology to describe members of the Baha'i faith. The law also stipu-
 lates penalties for government workers who do not observe "Islamic principles and
 rules.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-Citizens may travel to any part of Iran, although there have been re-
 strictions on travel to Kurdish areas during times of heavy fighting. People may
 change their place of residence without obtaining official permission. The Govern-
 ment requires exit permits for draft-age males and citizens who are politically sus-
 pect. Some Iranians, particularly those whose skills are in short supply and who
 were educated at government expense, must post bonds to obtain exit permits.
 The Government permits Iranian Jews to travel abroad, but often denies them the
 multiple-exit permits normally issued to other citizens. The Government does not
 normally permit all members of a Jewish family to travel abroad at the same time.
 The Government and the UIN. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) esti-
 mate that there are approximately 1.3 million Afghan refugees in Iran. Of this total,
 only about 21,800 are accommodated in refugee camps administered by the Govern-
 ment. The rest live seminomadic lives or reside in settlements. In 1996 about 10,000
 refugees repatriated to Afghanistan. This was far fewer than the UNHCR had pre-
 
 
 1262
 dicted would return and resulted from continued instability in Taliban-controlled
 areas of Afghanistan.
 The UNHCR estimates that there are about 580,000 Iraqi Kurdish and Shi'a Mus-
 lim refugees in Iran who were displaced by the Gulf War. In September an addi-
 tional 65,000 Iraqi Kurdish refugees fled to Iran following the eruption of fighting
 between two Kurdish factions in northern Iraq. Since the cessation of fighting in
 October, the majority of this most recent wave of refugees has returned to Iraq.
 The Government generally cooperates with the UNHCR and other humanitarian
 organizations in assisting refugees. Iran is a signatory to the 1951 Convention Re-
 lating to the Status of Refugees and its 1967 U-. Protocol. Although the Govern-
 ment generally provides first asylum (as demonstrated by the large number of Af-
 ghan and Iraqi refugees in Iran), there have been instances where pressure was ap-
 plied to force refugees to return to their home countries. In late 1996, the Govern-
 ment hastened the return of many recently arrived raqiKurdish refugees by de-
 priving them of adequate food and other relief. The UNHCR prtested this policy
 of forced repatriation to the Government.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The right of citizens to change theirgovernment is severely compromised by the
 leadership of the Government, which effectively manipulates the electoral system to
 its advantage. Iran is ruled by a group of religious leaders and their lay associates
 who share a belief in the leitimacy of a theocratic state based on Ayatollah Kho-
 meini's interpretation of Shi a Islam. There is no separation of state and religion.
 The clerics dominate all branches of government. The Government represses any
 movement seeking to separate state and religion, or to alter the State's existing the-
 ocratic foundation. The selection of candidates for elections is effectively controlled
 byth ruling clerics.
 the Constitution provides for a Council of Guardians composed of six Islamic cler-
 gymen and six lay members who review all laws for consistency with Islamic law
 and the Constitution. The Council also screens political candidates for ideological
 and religious suitability. It accepts only candidates who support a theoatic state,
 but clerics who disagaree with government     have also been disqualified.
 m enary scheduled elec ions fae hel  or the President, members of Parliament
 oteMiles), and members of the Assembly of Experts, a body responsible for select-
 ing the successor to the Leader of the Revolution. The Males exercises a consider-
 able amount of independence from the executive branch, hbut its decisions are re-
 viewed by the Council of Guardians. Vigorous parliamentary debates take place on
 various issues, and in some cases the Majles has respected laws proposed by the
 executive branch. Most deputies are associated with powerful political and religious
 officials, but often vote independently and shift from one faction to another.
 Majles elections in the spring were marred by government control and violence.
 Preelection debate was vigorous, but the Council of Guardians succeeded in control-
 lin(e the elections by selectively approig candidates. Human Rights Watch (HRW)
 estimated that the Government diqaiied about 44 percent of the 5,121 prospec-
 tive candidates, including 32 sitting members of the Majles. The criteria for vettin
 candidates was vague; the Council did not have to give a reason for reection; and
 there was no right of appeal. The U.N. Special Rapporteur noted a numeraofirreg-
 ularities in the elections, in particular the nullification of election results in eight
 jurisdictions apparently on ideological grounds. Most of the candidates disqualified
 were pragmatists rather than onservativ" e candidates.
 Human Rights Watch received reports indicating that riot police opened fre on
 demonstrators protesting government interference in the northwestern city of Bonab
 during voting on March 8. On April 6, the Government annulled election results in
 Isfahan, Macayer, Najafabad, Naeen, Miandoab, Meimeh, Borkhar, and Khomeini
 Shahre. New elections for these constituencies were to be held after 5 months but
 theyodid not materiaize. On April 19, runoff elections took place for 125 seats.
 W   omen are underrepresented in government. They hold only 9 of 270 Majlies
 seats, and there are no female cabinet members.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 In 1996 the Government continued to repress local human rights groups, but it
 was more cooperative with foreign groups. The U.N. Special Representatives on
 Human Rights in Iran, Freedom of Expression, and Religious Freedom visited Iran.
 In addition Human Rights Watch sent a representative. All reported reasonably
 good cooperation from the Government, but a  ound ontinuing serious abuses of
 human rights. The ICRC and the UNHCR both operate in Iran.
 
 
 1263
 The Government established a human rights committee in the Majiles and a
 human rights commission in the judiciary, but observers believe that they lack inde-
 pendence. Government officials regularly assert that Iran should be judged by Is-
 lamic, rather than Western, human rights principles, and reject the universality of
 human rights.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 In general the Government does not discriminate on the basis of race, disability,
 language, or social status. The Government does discriminate on the basis of reli-
 gion and sex.
 Women.-Although domestic violence is known to occur, little is known about its
 extent. Abuse in the family is considered a private matter and seldom discussed
 publicly. There are no official statistics on the subject.
 Discrimination against women has increased since the revolution. In general
 women suffer discrimination in the legal code, particularly in family and property
 matters. It is difficult for many women, particularly those residing outside arg
 cities, to obtain any legal redress. Under the legal system, a woman a testimony as
 a witness is worth only half that of a man's, making it difficult for a woman to prove
 a case against a male defendant. In addition the families of female victims of violent
 crime often have to pay the assailant's court costs to bring him to trial. Although
 women may be educated and employed in the professions, social constraints tend
 to inhibit their educational and economic opportunities. Illiteracy and the lack of
 university degrees also affect their standing. The enforcement of conservative Is-
 lamic dress codes has varied considerably since the death of Ayatollah Khomeini in
 1989. Nonetheless, such dress codes persist and are enforced arbitrarily.
 Under legislation passed in 1983, women have the right to divorce, and regula-
 tions promulgated in 1984 substantially broadened the grounds on which a woman
 may seek a divorce. However, a husband is not required to cite a reason for divorc-
 ing his wife. In 1986 the Majles passed a 12-article law on marriage and divorce
 that limited the privileges accorded to men by custom and traditional interpreta-
 tions of Islamic law. The 1986 law also recognized divorced women's rights to a
 share of the property that couples acquire during their marriage and increased ali-
 mony rights.
 In June the Government requested the U.N. High Commissioner for Human
 Rights to "render advisory services to the nongovernmental organization (NGO) net-
 work on women existing in the country," according to the U.N. Special Representa-
 tive.
 In 1995 the Government permitted women to attain the rank of judges. But the
 Government does not permit female judges to preside over legal hearings, so the
 practical effect of the change in the law remains unclear. Women's activities can be
 severely restricted by the hizbollahi as well.
 Children.-Most children have access to education through the 12th grade, and
 to some form of health care. There is no known pattern of child abuse.
 People With Disabilities.-There is no available information regarding whether
 the Government has legislated or otherwise mandated accessibility for the disabled.
 The Cable News Network (CNN) reported, however, in late October on the harsh
 conditions in an institution for retarded children who had been abandoned by their
 parents. The film showed children tied or chained to their beds, in filthy conditions,
 without appropriate care. It is not known to what extent this represents the typical
 treatment of the disabled Iran.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-The Kurds seek greater autonomy and con-
 tinue to suffer from government discrimination.
 Religious Minorities.-The Christian, Jewish, Zoroastrian, and Baha'i minorities
 suffer varying degrees of officially sanctioned discrimination, particularly in the
 areas of employment, education, and public accommodations (see Section 2.d.). Mus-
 lims who convert to Christianity also suffer discrimination.
 University applicants are required to pass an examination in Islamic theology. Al-
 though public-school students receive instruction in Islam, this requirement-limits
 the access of most religious minorities to higher education. Applicants for public-sec-
 tor employment are similarly screened for their adherence to laam
 Relgious minorities suffer discrimination in the legal system, receiving lower
 awards in injury and death lawsuits, and incurring heavier punishments than Mus-
 lims. Sunni Muslims encounter religious discrimination at the local level.
 In 1993 the U.N. Special Representative reported the existence of a government
 policy dirctive on the Baha'is. According to the directive, the Supreme Revolution-
 ar   uncil reportedly instrcted government agencies to block the progress and de-
 velopment of the Baha'i ommunity; expel Baai students from universities; cut the
 
 
 1264
 
 Baha'is' links with groups outside Iran- restrict the employment of Baha'is; and
 deny Baha'is "positions of influence," inciuding those in education. The Government
 claims that the directive is a forgery. However, it appears to be an accurate reflec-
 tion of current government practice.
 The persecution of Baha'is persisted in 1996. The Government continued to return
 some property previously confiscated from individual Baha'is, although the amount
 returned is a fraction of the total seized. Property belonging to the Baha'i commu-
 nity as a whole, however, such as places of worship, remains confiscated. Other gov-
 ernment restrictions have been eased, so that Baha'is may currently obtain food ra-
 tion booklets and send their children to public schools. However, the prohibition
 against the admission of Baha'is to universities appears to be enforced. Thousands
 of Baha'is dismissed from government jobs in the early 1980's receive no unemploy-
 ment benefits and have been required to repay the Government for salaries or pen-
 sions received from the first day of employment. Those unable to do so face prison
 sentences (see Sections 1.d. and 5).
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Although the Labor Code grants workers the right
 to establish unions, there are no independent unions. A national organization known
 as the Worker's House, founded in 1982, is the sole authorized national labor orga-
 nization. It serves primarily as a conduit for government control. The leadership of
 the Worker's House coordinates activities with Islamic labor councils, which are or-
 ganized in many enterprises. These councils also function as instruments of govern-
 ment control, although they have frequently been able to block layoffs and dismis-
 sals. Moreover, a network of government-backed guilds issues vocational licenses,
 funds financial cooperatives, and helps workers find jobs.
 The Government does not tolerate any strike deemed to be at odds with its eco-
 nomic and labor policies. In 1993 the Parliament passed a law that prohibits strikes
 by government workers. It also prohibits government workers fromhaving contacts
 with foreigners and stipulates penalties or failure to observe Islamic dress codes
 and principles at work.
 There are no known affiliations with international labor organizations.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively-Workers do not have the
 ight to organize independently and negotiate collective bargaining agreements. No
 information is avalable on mechanisms used to set wages.
 It is not known whether labor legislation and practice in the export processing
 zones differ from the law and practice in the rest o the country.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Penal Code provides that the
 Government may require any person who does not have work to take suitable em-
 ployment. This provision has been criticized frequently by the International Labor
 Organization (ILO) as contravening ILO Convention 29 on forced labor.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The labor law prohibits employ-
 ment of minors under 15 years of age and places special restrictions on the employ-
 ment of minors under age 18. Education is compulsory until age 11. The law per-
 mits children to work in agriculture, domestic service, and some small businesses.
 B, law women and minors may not be employed in hard labor or, in general, in
 night work. Information on the extent to which these regulations are enforced is not
 available.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The Labor Code empowers the Supreme Labor
 Council to establish annual minimum wage levels for each industrial sector and re-
 On. It is not known if the minimum wages are adjusted annually or enforced. The
 or Code stipulates that the minimum wage should be sufficient to meet the liv-
 ing expenses of a family and should take inflation into account. Many middle-class
 citizens must work two or even three jobs to support their families. It is unlikely
 that minimum wage laws alone can ensure a decent standard of living for a worker
 and family, given current economic conditions in Iran
 Information on the share of the working population covered by minimum wage
 legislation is not available.
 According to press reports, the Ministry of Labor in early December announced
 that employers had 1 month in which to fire foreign workers and replace them with
 Iranians. It is believed that approximately 1 million foreign workers, mostly Afghan
 refugees, would be affected. The Government apparently hoped to alleviate high un-
 employment by pressuring foreigners to leave.
 The Labor Code establishes a 6-day workweek of 48 hours maximum, with 1
 weekly rest day, normally Fridays, and at least 12 days of paid annual leave and
 several paid public holidays.
 According to the Labor Code, a Supreme Safety Council, chaired by the Labor
 Minister or his representative, is responsible for promoting workplace safety and
 
 
 1265
 health. The Council has reportedly issued 28 safety directives, and oversees the ac-
 tivities of 3,000 safety committees established in enterprises employing more than
 10 persons. It is not known how well the Ministry's inspectors enforce regulations.
 It is not known whether workers can remove themselves from hazardous situations
 without risking the loss of employment.
