 BRUNEI
 Brunei is a small, wealthy, Islamic monarchy located on the
 north coast of Borneo. It is predominantly Malay in
 population, although there are substantial Chinese and other
 minorities. Brunei is a hereditary and traditional Sultanate
 that has been ruled by the same family for over 500 years. A
 British protectorate until January 1, 1984, it has been
 internally self-governing since 1959.
 The Constitution promulgated in 1959 provided for the first
 sharing of political power by the Sultan with an advisory
 Council of Ministers. The Constitution, however, permits the
 Sultan to override the decisions of legislative and executive
 bodies in most instances. In elections for a legislative
 council in 1962, a party opposed to policies of the Sultan won
 a large majority; tensions over policy differences led to an
 armed uprising in December 1962 that was put down by British
 troops. The Sultan then invoked an article in the
 Constitution that allowed him to assume emergency powers for 2
 years. This state of emergency has been renewed every 2 years
 and is still in force. Several persons detained under
 emergency powers following the 1962 uprising remained in
 custody without trial until their release in January 1990.
 Although the Conrtitution is not suspended, the state of
 emergency allows the Sultan great latitude in ruling by
 orders. These orders have in effect suspended certain
 articles of the Constitution.
 The police force, which is firmly under the control of the
 civil authorities, is responsible for maintaining internal
 security.
 Since 1962 there have been no disturbances or agitation in
 Brunei. Economic factors have much to do with the general
 sense of well-being. Brunei has only about 240,000 people,
 but produces about 150,000 barrels of oil per day and slightly
 over 5 million tons of liquefied natural gas per year. It has
 one of the highest per capita gross national products in the
 world. Brunei has no debts, and the nation's financial
 reserves are commonly estimated at between 20 and 30 billion
 dollars. Petroleum revenues and interest on invested reserves
 allow the Government to provide free medical care, schools,
 and university training to its citizens. A large proportion
 of the Malay population is employed by the Government at
 generous salaries which permit a higher standard of living
 than in surrounding countries. Government employees are
 eligible for low-interest or no-interest loans to purchase
 homes, automobiles, and appliances. The nation's second
 largest employer, Brunei Shell, provides similar benefits to
 its employees. Brunei has no income tax. There are several
 substantial, low-cost housing plans designed to provide homes
 for the landless. There is a chronic shortage of labor
 throughout the economy, which helps to keep employee wage and
 benefit packages high and makes it relatively easy for women
 to find work in traditionally male occupations.
 All remaining political detainees were released in 1990, some
 conditionally. There were no other major human rights
 developments during the year. The principal human rights
 problems included restrictions on freedoms of speech, press,
 and association, and the right of citizens to change the
 Government.

 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 There were no reports of politically motivated killings.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no known disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 In late 1988 whipping became mandatory as punishment for 42
 criminal offenses, including rape, assault, extortion, robbery,
 theft, vandalism, and drug-related crimes. Since then,
 occasional sentences of whipping have been handed down and
 carried out in the presence of a doctor who monitors the
 condition of the prisoner and has the authority to interrupt
 the punishment and postpone it until a later date. Hong Kong
 provides judges for Brunei's High Court and Court of Appeal
 under a Treaty of Friendship between Brunei and the United
 Kingdom. A small group of Hong Kong judges requested that they
 not be considered for duty on the Brunei High Court and Court
 of Appeal because the mandatory nature of whipping as
 punishment for some offenses denied them discretion in cases in
 which they might believe extenuating circumstances existed.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The Constitution has no provision for habeas corpus. The right
 exists, however, as the Application of Laws Act states that the
 law of England (as of 1951) applies except where Brunei has
 passed its own law. Under normal circumstances, a magistrate
 must "endorse" a warrant for arrest. On rare occasions,
 warrants are issued without this endorsement.
 The Internal Security Act (ISA) permits the Government to
 detain suspects without trial for renewable 2-year periods.
 Since the abortive rebellion in 1962, the Government has
 occasionally used the ISA to detain persons suspected of
 antigovernment activity.
 Five former members of the Brunei People's Party (BPP) who had
 been in detention since 1962 were released in January 1990, and
 several other former BPP members who had been in detention for
 shorter periods were released later in the year. Two former
 leaders of the Brunei National Democratic Party (BNDP), who had
 been in detention since 1988, were given their conditional
 release in March 1990. They must stay indoors between 10 p.m.
 and 6 a.m., refrain from all political activity for 1 year, and
 obtain police permission before traveling outside of their home
 district or leaving Brunei. At the end of the year there were
 no known political detainees remaining. None of the detainees
 was ever charged with any crime.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The legal system in Brunei is derived from the British system.
 Those suspected of common crimes are detained, tried, and
 punished according to the law. Lacking a senior judiciary of
 its own, the Brunei High Court has for its Chief Justice a
 
 
 818
 BRUNEI
 judge seconded from Hong Kong. There were no known instances
 of interference with the judiciary by the Government in 1990.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Although the Government is empowered by law to intrude into the
 privacy of individual persons, families, or homes, in practice
 it has not been known to do so.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Freedoms of speech and press, though not restricted by law, are
 not generally exercised. There is no political opposition, and
 hence there have been no challenges which might have tested the
 degree of government tolerance of political criticism.
 Brunei's only television station is government owned (two
 Malaysian stations can also be received). It usually avoids
 controversial issues, as do newscasts on the radio stations.
 The single daily newspaper is published independently but
 generally avoids controversial issues. A second newspaper is
 published weekly by the Government.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Freedom to assemble for political purposes has not been
 seriously tested in recent years. In 1985 the Government
 allowed establishment of the Brunei National Democratic Party
 (BNDP), the first political party since party activity was
 prohibited in 1967. Just before its first public meeting, the
 Government announced that government employees could not attend
 party meetings, become members of political parties, or
 otherwise engage in organized political debate. In February
 1988, the Government dissolved the BNDP and detained two of its
 leaders, charging that the party's contacts with the
 International Democratic Union were in violation of the
 Societies Act. The two BNDP leaders were released from
 detention in March 1990, subject to several restrictions on
 their activities.
 In 1986 the Government approved the establishment of a second
 political party, the Brunei National Solidarity Party, but that
 party has since remained inactive. The Government requires the
 registration of private economic, recreational, or other
 organizations.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Islam is the official state religion, but the Constitution
 provides for freedom of worship for other religions. There are
 several Christian churches in the country. There are also
 missionary schools in Brunei. Christians are not free to
 proselytize.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Except for certain released former political prisoners, there
 are no restrictions on freedom of movement in the country for
 citizens, permanent residents, and expatriates. Some
 restrictions on travel abroad are placed on certain expatriates
 
 
 819
 
 BRUNEI
 as part of contract obligations to the Government. Travel to
 Communist nations is restricted, and travel to China by
 Brunei's ethnic Chinese citizens and ethnic Chinese residents
 is tightly controlled. Brunei has not been willing to accept
 asylum seekers, has not agreed to the Comprehensive Plan of
 Action (CPA) adopted by the 1989 International Conference on
 Indochinese Refugees, and has pushed off at least one boatload
 of Vietnamese after refueling and reprovisioning the boat.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 There is no way in which citizens can change their government
 through established democratic processes. Under the continuing
 state of emergency, there are no representative bodies at the
 national or local level and, since the dissolution of the BNDP
 in 1988, no known functioning political parties. However,
 citizens may seek to influence the Government by working
 through appointed village headmen and district officers, who
 meet regularly with their constituents. They may also attempt
 to effect change by petitioning the Sultan directly.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 There are no government or private organizations in Brunei
 which deal specifically with the protection of human rights.
 Amnesty International reports it has on several occasions
 appealed to the Sultan for the release of a number of political
 prisoners, some held for many years without trial, but has
 received no reply. In 1988 the Government appeared before the
 U.N. Human Rights Commission to answer AI allegations of human
 rights violations relating to ISA detentions. The Government
 acknowledged the detentions but maintained that they were
 justified in the interest of national security. In 1990,
 however, the Government released the detainees.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Women are denied equal status with men in a nymber of important
 areas such as divorce, inheritance, and custody of children.
 While there are no separate pay scales for women and men, women
 in the work force traditionally have been concentrated in lower
 paying clerical and secretarial jobs and have been less likely
 to find positions offering rapid advancement. In recent years,
 however, employment opportunities for women have greatly
 improved throughout the economy, largely because of a chronic
 labor shortage. A growing number of women hold senior level
 professional positions, and the number of female university
 graduates is also increasing. Religious authorities strongly
 encourage Brunei Muslim women to wear the tudong, a traditional
 head covering, and a growing number do so. There is no
 pressure on non-Muslim women to wear the tudong, and few, if
 any, choose to wear it.
 The incidence of domestic violence against women is extremely
 low. Rape cases are similarly rare. Because of the close-knit
 nature of Bruneian society, this kind of behavior would be
 difficult if not impossible to conceal and would not be
 tolerated. The criminal penalty for a minor domestic assault
 would be 1 to 2 weeks in jail and a fine. An assault resulting
 in serious injury, such as broken bones, would be punished by
 whipping and a longer jail sentence.

 BRUNEI
 Few of the substantial Chinese minority in Brunei are citizens
 (those having no claims to other nationalities were
 "British-protected persons" prior to independence and are now
 either stateless permanent or temporary residents). Permanent
 residents cannot own land but usually resolve this problem
 through 7-year leases, the maximum amount of time for lease
 agreements in Brunei. The process of obtaining citizenship in
 Brunei is long and difficult. In general, the Chinese
 community has prospered in Brunei, and much of the country's
 commercial activity is in Chinese hands. While the Chinese
 have done well economically, many are now reevaluating their
 position in Brunei, especially the prospects of their children
 in a society in which Malay citizens are favored in such areas
 as government employment. Some are emigrating.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Trade unions are legal in Brunei but must be registered with
 the Government. Signatures of seven members are required for
 registration. There are four registered trade unions, with a
 total membership amounting to less than 5 percent of the work
 force. All workers, including civil servants, except for those
 serving in the military and police, are able to form or join
 trade unions. Unions are independent of the Government. The
 Trade Unions Act of 1962 permits the formation of trade union
 federations in Brunei but forbids affiliation of Brunei trade
 unions with labor organizations outside Brunei. Brunei is not
 a member of the International Labor Organization. An
 individual contract is required between an employer and each
 employee, but legal trade union activities cannot be deemed to
 violate employee contracts. Local legal experts interpret this
 provision as conferring the right to strike, but there have
 been no strikes in recent memory.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 The Government has not prevented the legal registration of
 trade unions, nor has it dissolved any. There is no government
 interference with lawful union activity. It is illegal to
 refuse employment or discriminate against an employee for being
 or not being a member of a trade union. While unions are legal
 and easy to register, conditions in Brunei are not conducive to
 the development of trade unions; there is little interest on
 the part of workers to form trade unions; and the unions that
 exist are not active. Brunei law is silent on collective
 bargaining, which is limited to only a few industries. Wage
 and benefit packages far exceed those of neighboring nations;
 there is a lack of those kinds of industries in which unions
 have traditionally developed; and there is a long cultural
 tradition of trying to achieve consensus rather than cause
 confrontation.
 There are no export-processing zones in Brunei.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Forced labor is prohibited and it is not practiced.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 Employment of children below the age of 16 is prohibited, and
 below the age of 18 requires parental consent and approval by
 the Labor Commission  Women under 18 may not work at night or
 
 
 821
 BRUNEI
 on offshore oil platforms. Laws on employment of children are
 effectively enforced by the Labor Department, which is a part
 of the Ministry of Home Affairs.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 Labor is in short supply, and market forces allow most citizens
 of Brunei to command high wages. The minimum wage in Brunei,
 established by government regulation, is approximately $11.35
 per day for citizens and permanent residents, and approximately
 $9.80 per day for foreigners. There is no special minimum wage
 for any particular industry. Overtime must be paid for work in
 excess of 48 hours, and double time must be paid for work
 performed on legal holidays. Workers earning the minimum wage
 are well off in Brunei. Occupational health and safety
 standards are established by government regulation. Working
 conditions are subject to inspection by the Labor Commission on
 a routine basis and in response to complaints. Labor
 regulations are effectively enforced by the Labor Department,
 which is empowered to close any place of employment in which
 health, safety, or working conditions are unsatisfactory.
