 FLJI
 Fiji's system of parliamentary democracy was interrupted in 1987 by the installa-
 tion of a military-led regime following two bloodless coups. Fiji returned to elected
 government in 1992. That government fell in November 1993 over failure to pass
 a budget for 1994. The subsequent general election in February 1994 returned sub-
 stantially the same government to oflice.
 Ethnicity plays a major role in FIji's politics, economy, and society. Fiji's more
 than 770,000 people constitute a multiracial society about evenly divided between
 indigenous Fijians and ethnic Indians. Indo-Fijians dominate the economy and pro-
 fessions and are well represented in the lower and middle levels of the public serv-
 ice, while ethnic Fijians control the political structurea and land rights and make
 up the bulk of the nation's military forces.
 The small but professional Fiji Military Forces (FMF) and a separate police force
 report to and are under the control of the Minister for Home Affairs and, ultimately,
 the President. In 1990, the Government also established the Fiji Intelligence Serv-
 ice, with limited powers to search people and property, tap telephones, and open
 mail. There continue to be reports of human rights abuses by the police.
 Sugar and tourism constitute the mainstays of the economy, accounting for almost
 half of the nation's foreign exchange earnings. The Government is promoting light
 manufacturing for export, notably in the garment industry, to diversify the economy
 and lessen its dependence on sugar and tourism.
 
 
 The principal human rights problem in 1994 remained constitutionally imposed
 and ethnically based political discrimination. Improvements in labor rights following
 the 1993 revision of certain restrictive 1991 labor decrees continued. Other human
 rights abuses include police brutality, inhibitions on freedom of the press, continued
 delays in bringing criminal and civil cases to trial, and violence and discrimination
 against women.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Peron, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political
 killings by the Government or any political group.
 There was one accusation of a death in official custody from unnatural causes. A
 man was killed, apparently while being arrested. Police claimed the victim bran-
 dished a knife. Other witnesses said he was drunk but unarmed and that the police
 used excessive force. The three officers involved were charged, suspended from the
 police, and at year's end were awaiting trial.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of disa pearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degradi     Treatment or Punishment
 Police sometimes physically abuse detainees; the autorities have punished the of-
 fending officers in some instances, but punishments have been light and thus have
 not served as an effective deterrent to others. The police department's internal af-
 fairs unit investigates complaints of police brutality and has begun to work with the
 Ombudsman's ofice to ensure impartial observers in the investigation of complaints
 about police conduct.
 The -law permits corporal punishment as a penalty for criminal acts; strokes of
 the cane are administered under medical supervision, but this provision is rarely
 invoked.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Law of Arrest and Detention pro-
 vides that a person may be arrested only if police believe that a breach of the crimi-
 nal law has been or is about to be committed. Arrested persons must be brought
 before a court without 'undue delay." This is taken to mean within 24 hours, with
 48 hours as the exception (such as when an arrest is made over the weekend). Rules
 governing detention are designed to ensure fair questioning of suspects. Defendants
 have the right to a judicial review of the grounds for arrest; in urgent cases defend-
 ants may apply to a judge at any time, whether he is sitting or not. Incommunicado
 and arbitrary detention, both illegal, did not occur in 1994.
 Exile is not practiced.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The judicial structure was reorganized under the
 1990 Constitution. The principal courts are the magistrate courts, high court, and
 the Court of Appeal. The Constitution also provided for a Supreme Court as the
 court of final appeal, but to date it has not been established. The Court of Appeal
 is slowly reducing the enormous backlog of cases caused by the Government's failure
 to appoint a president for the court until December 1991 and the court's consequent
 inability to convene before that time.
 There are no special courts; military courts try only members of the armed forces.
 Magistrate courts continue to try the large majority of cases. In addition to its juris-
 diction in serious civil and criminal cases, the high court is granted special interest
 jurisdiction on behalf of the public and is empowered to review alleged violations
 of individual rights guaranteed under the Constitution.
 The judiciary is independent under the Constitution and in practice. There were
 no credible reports in 1994 that a court was influenced by the executive.
 The right to public trial is guaranteed and defendants have the right to counsel.
 Trials in the high court provide for the presence of assessors (citizens randomly se-
 lected to represent the community); cases in the magistrate court do not. In litiga-
 tion involving lesser complaints, a public legal advisor assists indigent persons in
 domestic or family law cases. The right of appeal exists but is hampered by continu-
 ing delays in the appeals process. Bail procedures mean that most defendants do
 not experience any pretrial detention.
 The law sometimes treats women differently from men. In some instances there
 is a presumption of reduced competence and thus reduced responsibility. For exam-
 ple, only women can be charged with infanticide (if a man kills an infant it is treat-
 ed as murder). A woman in an infanticide case is presumed to have diminished
 mental capacity, and sentences are reduced accordingly.
 There are no political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-In gen-
 eral, privacy of the home is respected. However, the Intelligence Service has powers
 to search people and property, open mall, and tap telephones when a warrant is is-
 
 
 sued by the National Security Council, within specific operational guidelines out-
 lined in the government decree which created it. The Intelligence Service does con-
 duct surveillance of persons it believes represent a security threat. Some political
 dissidents believe their telephones and mail are monitored, but they have not pro-
 vided substantiating evidence.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-Freedom of speech is generally respected. Politi-
 cal figures and private citizens can and do speak out against the Government. Al-
 though the Public Order Act and other acts prohibit actions that are likely to incite
 racial antagonism, no arrests for making public statements were reported or be-
 lieved to have occurred in 1994.
 The Government has broad discretionary powers to impose restrictions on press
 freedom, and has used them in the past. The possibility of their use also serves to
 encourage media self-censorship. Concerned over the publication of material embar-
 rassing to government figures, the Government renewed discussion of regulating the
 media.
 The Government effectively pressured one weekly newspaper publisher to su -
 press publication of information about the private life of a senior government off-
 cial. The Government also expressed its extreme displeasure over what it considered
 a lack of media accountability for its errors and a lack of recourse for those who
 felt they had been wronged in some way. Inferring a threat of an imposed media
 watchdog body, late in the year senior media representatives created the Fiji News
 Council, although with less than universal participation by media outlets and with
 considerable opposition from working journalists.
 Legislation pertaining to the press is contained in the Newspaper Registration Act
 (NRA) and the Press Correction Act (PCA). Under the NRA, aU newspapers must
 be registered with the Government before they can begin publishing. The PCA gives
 the Minister of Information sole discretionary power to order a newspaper to publish
 a "correcting statement" if, in his opinion, a false or distorted article has been pub-
 lished. Should the newspaper refuse to publish the Minister's correction, it can be
 taken to court and, if found guilty, fined approximately $700 (individual persons
 convicted under the Act maybe fined approximately $150 andlor imprisoned for 6
 months). The PCA allows the Government to arrest anyone who publishes "mali-
 cious" material. This includes anything the Government considers false news which
 could create or foster public alarm or result in "detriment to the public."
 The media operate without prior censorship but with considerable selfcensorship.
 Newspapers occasionally print editorials critical of the Government, but rarely do
 investigative reporting. They widely report statements about the political situation
 by opposition figures and foreign governments. The letters columns of the two daily
 newspapers also frequently carry political statements from a wide cross section of
 Fji society, including members of the deposed precoup government, which are high-
 ly critical of the Government, its programs and the Constitution. Criticism-albeit
 muted-of the once sacrosanct traditional chiefly system is begng to appear.
 However, the Government still views comments about individual chiefs with disfa
 vor.
 An active local organization, the Fiji Islands Media Association (FIMA), is an affi-
 iate of the regionalPacific Islands News Association (PINA). Both FIMA and PINA
 are pressing for better training and the establishment of codes of ethics for journal-
 ists. The Government provided space for housing the Fiji Journalism Training Insti-
 tute.
 The advent of television has raised the specter of censorship, openly advocated by
 the head of the powerful Methodist Church in Fiji and others. Fiji's "temporary" tel-
 evision service phased into a 'permanent" service in July. News production is still
 in the hands of the Government's video unit and can be characterized as a digest
 of government activities, actions, and viewpoints.
 While academic freedom is respected, the Government has effectively deterred
 university employees from participation in -'omestic politics. Since 1991 staff mem-
 bers of the Fiji-based University of the South Pacific must take leave if they rin
 for public office and must resign from their posts if elected. Senior staff may not
 hold office in political parties.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.--The Constitution provides the
 right to assemble for political purposes, subject to restriction in the interest of pub-
 lic order. District officers must issue permits for public gatherings. The Government
 does not always grant permits for large outdoor political meetings or demonstra-
 tions, particularly if the police advise of difficulties with the anticipated crowd size
 or their ability to assure public safety.

 There was no government interference with political activities during the Feb-
 ruary general election. Permits were routinely issued for rallies organized by politi-
 cal parties religious groups, and groups opposed to the Government. All opposition
 party headquarters remain open. Political organizations are allowed to operate and
 issue public statements. They did so repeatedy and openly throughout the year.
 c. Freedom of Relgion.-The Constitutional provision for freedom of religion is
 honored in practice. The Government does not restrict foreign clergy and missionary
 activity or other typical activities of religious organizations.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Government does not restrict freedom of movement within the
 country or abroad. Occasional detentions at the airport occur, but the courts do not
 hesitate to order redress where this is warranted. Fii citizens are free to emigrate,
 and the Government does not restrict their return if they choose to do so. There are
 no refugees in Fiji and no forced resettlement programs.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The constitutional provisions ensuring political dominance by ethnic Fijians, pri-
 marily through race-based voting rolls and representation in Parliament, abridge
 the right of citizens to change their government. Moreover, the Constitution was
 promulted by a nonelected interim government and has not been approved by a
 national referendum. At year's end it was under review by a parliamentary select
 committee.
 The Constitution guarantees ethnic Fijian dominance of the Government by pro-
 viding them with 37 of 70 seats in the elected lower house of Parliament. Indo-
 Fijians are accorded 27 seats, Rotumans (culturally distinct Polynesians) 1, and all
 others 5. In the Senate (an appointed body with essentially review powers and the
 right to veto legislation), ethnic Fijians hold 24 of the 34 seats, Rotumans 1 and
 the other groups 9. Other constitutional features designed to ensure ethnic Fijian
 dominance include a requirement that the Prime Minister be an ethnic Fijian and
 selection procedures which virtually ensure that the President will also be an ethnic
 The Constitution also incorporates a bill of rights, providing for freedom of speech,
 assembly, religion, and other universally accepted rights and freedoms. These rights
 may not be altered by Parliament except with the approval of two-thirds of the
 lower house. However, Parliament is also given the authority to pass special acts
 to deal with certain specified emergency situations, notwithstanding human rights
 uarantees found in other sections of the Constitution. The Attorney General's office
 as taken the view that any legislation introduced under the emergency powers pro-
 vision would require the approval of two-thirds of the lower house. Critics of the
 Constitution maintain that only a simple majority would be needed and that indige-
 nous Fijians in the lower house would be able, solely on the strength of their own
 numbers, to abrogate constitutional human rights protections. This interpretation
 has never been tested.
 The President is selected by the Great Council of Chiefs (GCC) a traditional
 Fijian leadership body. The President appoints the Fijian members of the Senate on
 the advice of the GCC and the provincial councils, and on his own judgment with
 regard to the nine members of other races. He appoints the one Rotuman senator
 on the advice of the Rotuman Council. The President chooses the Prime Minister,
 who, along with the Cabinet, holds most of the executive authority, from among the
 Fijian members of the lower house on the basis of ability to command majority sup-
 port within that bedy.
 Elections are held by secret ballot, with voting only by communal constituencies.
 The Constitution calls for elections every 5 years but the Government may call an
 election at any time as it did the snap general election in February after failing to
 pass its 1994 budget. The Constitution provides for a formal review of its provisions
 within 7 years of its promulgation and every 10 years thereafter.
 When Prime Minister Rabuka's 1994 budget was rejected by Parliament in No-
 vember 1993, Rabuka asked the Acting President to dissolve that body in accord-
 ance with the Constitution. The subsequent snap general election in February, con-
 sidered free and fair by all observers, returned Rabuka and his party to Parliament
 in strength. Rabuka was again selected as Prime Minister.
 Fiji has a dozen political parties. Four are predominantly Indo-Fijian. The major
 ones, the National Federation Party (NFP) and the Fi Labour Party (FLP) pledged
 to continue their opposition to the Constitution in the Parliament. NFP and FLP
 Indo-Fijian parliamentarians are joined on the opposition side of the legislature by
 another ethnic Fijian party (the Fijian Association) and one multiracial party (the
 All National Congress).

 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 ve8igation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 There are no local groups in Fiji which focus solely on human rights matters, but
 the women's rights movement, the labor movement, and various political group (in-
 cluding organized political parties) are engaged in promoting human rights. There
 are also several small, not very active, foreign-based organizations which con-
 centrate on human rights causes in Fiji including the Coalition for Democracy in
 Fiji (with offices in New Zealand and Australia) and two United Kingdom-based
 groups, the International Fiji Movement and the Movement for Democracy in Fiji.
 The Government in past years inhibited certain investigations of the political and
 human rights situation by external organiations, considering them to constitute ex-
 ternal interference in its domestic affairs. However, in 1994 it allowed foreign rep-
 resentatives to attend and participate in the University of the South Pacifies con-
 sultation on the national agenda. That discussion roundly criticized many govern-
 ment policies and politicians as well as the Constitution. The views expressed were
 fully and prominently covered in the press.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution prohibits discrimination on the basis of, and provides specific af-
 firmative action provisions to improve the conditions of those disadvantaged as a re-
 sult of, race, sex, place of origin, political opinion, color, religion, or creed.
 Women.-Despite Constitutional provisions, the Government practiced a form of
 sexual discrimination in the recognition of spousal and offspring rights. For exam-
 ple, spouses of Fiji citizen women are not automatically granted residence, whereas
 spouses of Fiji citizen males are. Offspring of female ethnic Fijians married to
 nonethnic Fijians are not entitled to registry in the document governing which per-
 sons share in income from communal ownership of native lands, and who has the
 right to vote as an ethnic Fijian, and who holds ethnic Fijian-designated seats in
 Parliament. Men, however, confer ethnic Fijian status to their offspring regardless
 of the mothers ethnic background. In a high-profile 1992 court challenge to the reg-
 istration restrictions, the son of a Chinese father and ethnic Fijian mother won his
 appeal to be registered as an ethnic Fijian. The Government withdrew its appeal
 of the decision in October. The long-term effects of the decision on registration re-
 strictions and, thus, a woman s right to pass on her ethnic status remain unclear.
 Women in both the Fijian and Indian communities have functioned primarily in
 traditional roles, although some women achieve responsible positions in the public
 service, politics and business. The female Minister of Education served as Acting
 Prime Minister during Prime Minister Rabuka's April-May visit to the United
 States. Women can also attain high status in Fiji's traditional chiefly system. The
 President's wife is, in her own right, Fiji's second highest ranking traditional chief.
 The Minister for Fijian Affairs, a woman, is widely believed to be the best candidate
 to become Fiji's highest ranking traditional chief.
 In general, women in the Fijian community are more likely to rise to prominence
 in their own right than are women in the Indo-Fijian community. Women have full
 rights of property ownership and inheritance, and a number have become successful
 entrepreneurs. Women are generally paid less than men, a discrepancy that is espe-
 cially notable in the garment industry. Garment workers, most of whom are female,
 are subject to a special minimum wage considerably lower than that in other sec-
 tors.
 There is a small but active women's rights movement, which has pressed for more
 serious treatment of rape in the courts. The convicted persons tend to draw widely
 varying, but usually short, prison sentences (a few years). Efforts are under way to
 have all rape cases heard in the high court (vice magistrate's court at the accused's
 choice) where sentencing limits are higher.
 Domestic violence is also a problem in Fiji and its mitigation is a second major
 focus of the women's movement. The authorities are generally reluctant to intervene
 in cases of domestic violence unless it is necessary to save the woman's life. Few
 cases result in prosecution, as the victim generally does not press charges. The Gov-
 ernment has not been active in dealing with domestic violence.
 Suva, the capital, and the regional center of Ba have privately funded women's
 crisis centers which offer counseling and assistance to women in cases of rape, do-
 mestic violence, and other problems, such as child support payments. There is, over-
 all, a gwing awareness of women's issues.
 Children.--Changes centered around the undermining of the traditional village
 and extended family-based society-and improvements in record keeping-have re-
 vealed a major problem of child abuse in Fiji. Reported cases have almost doubled
 over the last 4 years. The legal system is inadequate for protecting the rights of
 
 
 590
 children, as children's testimony is inadmissible unless corroborated by an adult.
 The Government created a Child Welfare Committee in 1993 to address these prob-
 lems, but it is likely to remain reluctant to become involved in family matters.
 Corporal punishment is widely practiced in schools and at home. The Ministry of
 Education has guidelines for the administration of such punishment by principals
 and head teachers. One principal in the Rewa Delta area was fired in1993 for
 overstepping these restrictions. There are credible reports that not all abuses are
 repo     or punished.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-The stated purpose of the 1987 military
 coups was to ensure the political supremacy of the indigenous Fijian people and to
 protect their traditional way of life and communal control of land. To this end, a
 number of measures have been taken that favor the Fijian community over other
 ethnic groups. The most obvious are the apportionment of seats in Parliament to
 guarantee a preponderance of ethnic Fijians and constitutional provisions ensuring
 selection of an ethnic Fijian president and prime minister. The Government is also
 committed to raising the proportion of ethnic Fijians and Rotumans in the public
 service to 50 percent or more at all levels. This is reflected in current promotion
 and hiring policies in the public service favoring ethnic Fijians; as a result some
 Indo-Fijians have complained that, despite their experience and higher educational
 achievements, they are not promoted beyond middle management.
 Control of land is a highly sensitive issue. The British colonial administration in-
 stituted present land ownership arrangements to protect the interests of the indige-
 nous Fijians, who currently hold, communally, about 83 percent of the land. Most
 cash crop farmers are Indo-Fijians, who lease their land from the Fijian landowners
 through the Native Lands Trust Board. Freehold land title is not an indigenous con-
 cept; lands owned currently by the State (8 percent) and by individuals (9 percent)
 were transferred from customary owners during the colonial period. Many Indo-
 Fijians, particularly farmers, believe that the absence of secure land tenure dis-
 criminates against them. Between 1997 and 2000, the majority of the current leases
 will expire. A review of the current land tenure and leasing arrangements is under-
 way, with all indications that few changes will be made to the existing system.
 People With Disabilities.-Legal discrimination against physically disabled per-
 sons in employment, education, and provision of other state services in Fiji does not
 exist, however, there is no legislation or mandated provisions for accessibility for the
 disabled.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The law protects workers' rights to form and join
 unions, elect their own representatives, publicize their views on labor matters, and
 determine their own policies, and this is observed in practice. However, the law per-
 mits restrictions to be applied to government employees; or in the interests of de-
 fense, public safety, public order, public morality, or public health, or to protect the
 rights and freedoms of other persons. An estimated 19 percent of the labor force is
 unionized.
 All unions must register with, but are not controlled by, the Government. The
 only central labor body is the Fiji Trade Union Congress (FTUC), which was closely
 associated with the opposition Fiji Labour Party until mid-1992. It currently takes
 a more independent political stance. The FTUC is free to associate internationally
 and does so. The labor movement is led largely by Indo-Fijians, with ethnic Fijians
 beginning to assume leadership roles. Persons with close ties to the Government
 have started rival unions primarily for ethnic Fijians; these unions are more ame-
 nable to political cooperation with the Government.
 In April the Parliament completed a 2-year process of reforming labor legislation
 by amending the previous acts on industrial associations (eliminating a ban on hold-
 ing multiple union officer positions) and trade unions (eliminating restrictions on
 seeking international support on labor issues).
 Strikes are legal in Fiji, except in connection with union recognition disputes. The
 Government remains involved m certifying union strike balloting, which can be an
 elaborate process given the distance between some of the island locations in the
 ountry. The Ministry of Labour had recorded five strikes as of September 15.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Fiji law recognizes the right
 to organize and bargain collectively. Employers are required to recognize a union
 if more than half the employees in a worplace have joined it. Recognition is deter-
 mined by union members hip numbers rather than by an election. The Government
 has the power to order recalcitrant employers to recognize unions and has done so.
 Key sectors of the economy, including sugar and tourism, are heavily organized. Fol-
 lowing the May 1992 elections, the Government lifted wage guidelines, and unre-
 stricted collective bargaining on wages is now the norm.
 
 
 591
 Wage negotiations are conducted on an individual company or enterprise basis
 rather than on an industry-wide basis. A government proposal to introduce such ne-
 gotiations has been opposed by employers and unions.
 Antiunion discrimination is specifically prohibited by law. In practice, the unions
 are generally successful in preventing discrimination against workers for union ac-
 tivities, but the law does not mandate that fired workers be reinstated.
 Fiji's export processing zones are subject to the same laws as the rest of the coun-
 try, and many of their firms have unions which have negotiated collective bargain-
 ingareements.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Constitution specifically pro-
 hibits forced labor, and there is no indication that it is practiced.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Chidren.--Children under 12 may not be em-
 ployed in any capacity. 'Children' (under ae 15) and "young persons" (ages 15-17)
 may not be employed in industry or work with machinery. Enforcement by the Min-
 istry of Labour and Industrial Relations generally is effective, except in the case of
 family members working on family farms or businesses and "self-employed" younger
 street urchins. Education is not mandatory.
 e. Acptable Conditions of Work.-There is no national minimum wage. Certain
 sectors have minimum wages set by the Ministry for Labour and Industrial Rela-
 tions, which effectively enforces them. Minimum wage levels will generally support
 a barely adequate standard of living in all sectors, except for thegarment industry
 in which the starting wage, $0.50 (F$0.72) for learners and $0.6 (F$0.94) for o2-
 ers, is based on the assumption that workers are young adults or married women
 living at home and not supporting a household.
 Fiji has no regulation specifying maximum hours of work for adult males. Women
 are prohibited from night work in factories (other than overtime work in the gar-
 ment industry) and underground work in mines. Certain industries, notably trans-
 portation and shipping, have problems with excessive hours of work. Indo-Fijians,
 who generally require a cash income to survive, are more vulnerable to pressure to
 work long hours than ethnic Fijians. Many ethnic Fijians can and do return to a
 non-cash economy way of life in their villages rather than work what they consider
 excessive hours.
 Fiji has workplace safety regulations, a Workinens' Compensation Act, and an ac-
 cident compensation plan. Awards for workers injured on the job are set by a tribu-
 nal. Government enforcement of safety standards under the direction of the Labor
 Ministry suffers from a lack of trained enforcement personnel, but the unions do a
 reasonable ob of monitoring safety standards in organized workplaces. The Inter-
 national Labor Organizations recommendations in November 1992 cited the need to
 improve working conditions (problems are particularly widespread in the garment
 industry). The Government drafted legislation to address these shortcomings but
 Parliament had not acted on it by year's end.
