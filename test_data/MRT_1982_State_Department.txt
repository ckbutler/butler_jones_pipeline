 MAURITANIA
 The Islamic Republic of Mauritania has been ruled by
 a Committee for National Salvation since the military
 took power in a coup d'etat in July 1978. The Committee
 rules by decree and little provision is made for dissent.
 The Committee inherited a series of major problems stemming
 from an economy that had been seriously weakened by the
 drought, Mauritania's involvement ir, the Western Sahara'
 conflict, as well as from internal political and social
 difficulties.
 The country is also plagued by internal political diffi-
 culties. Mauritania's dominant Moors and the ethnic
 black population have clashed over the issue of Arabiza-
 tion of the schools. Renewed efforts to abolish slavery-
 and to introduce the Sharia (the Islamic legal code) in
 criminal cases have been similarly contentious; both
 constitute ambitious efforts to reshape the basis of
 Mauritanian society. By attempting to end vestiges of
 slavery, the Government is trying to reduce ethnic ten-
 sions between the blacks and Moors. By introducing a
 strict and simple criminal code based on Islamic law,
 relying on corporal punishment to deter crime, the Gov-
 ernment is attempting to reinforce identification with
 Islam and reduce common crime substantially.
 The 1979 peace treaty with the Polisario (Popular Front
 for the Liberation of Sakiet Al-Hamra and Rio de Oro)
 removed Mauritania from direct participation in the Western
 Saharan conflict. However, the peace treaty solved neither
 the economic problems caused by debts incurred fighting the
 war, nor the delicate issue of remaining neutral in a
 conflict involving countries in the sub-region.
 The drought that devastated the Sahel in the early 1970's
 also caused serious damage in Mauritania, decimating
 livestock herds and driving nomads into the capital city.
 Although iron ore production has been restored to levels
 attained before the Saharan War began and government
 spending has been reduced, drought conditions have raised
 the cost of food imports. Mauritania's serious economic
 difficulties place a severe burden on the impoverished
 majority of the population. Increased energy costs have
 added substantially to Mauritania's international debt.
 In the context of these problems, the Committee has im-
 posed firm controls over the country, restricting political
 activity. The Government has forbidden all unauthorized
 assemblies organized for the purpose of political discus-
 sion. Opposition groups are not permitted, and the media
 is government-controlled.
 However, the Government in 1982 has generally adhered to
 sections of Mauritanian law that guarantee the integrity
 of the person. There is no recent evidence of mass arrests,
 brutality, or torture. The administration of justice is
 based on the French Declaration of the Rights of Man, the
 Universal Declaration on Human Rights, and the Sharia.
 A return to civilian rule has been discussed by the Gov-
 ernment since taking power and remains its stated goal.
 
 
 203
 A coup attempt against the Committee on March 16, 1981
 constituted the severest test to date of the military's
 authority and led the Government to take steps to reassert
 its control. Although the coup was put down, the Committee
 reacted by executing or imprisoning the participants after
 a public trial, and by breaking diplomatic relations with
 Morocco, which it accused of harboring and supporting the
 coup plotters. A move towards civilian government, begun
 in December 1980 with the appointment of a civilian prime
 minister and the discussion of a draft constitution, was
 postponed in the wake of the attempted coup.
 Government attempts to meet the basic needs of the people
 and reduce social and economic inequities are hindered as
 much by Mauritania's extremely low population density as by
 severe economic constraints. Easing of chronic food short-
 ages, made worse in recent years by the drought, as well as
 educational development are the major goals of the Govern-
 ment.
 1.   Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Killing
 There have been no reports of killings carried out for
 political or other motives by the Government or opposition
 political organizations in Mauritania since the executions
 following the March 1981 coup attempt.
 b. Disappearance
 There is no evidence of abductions, secret arrests, or
 clandestine detentions. There are no reports of terrorist
 activity within the'country which includes such practices.
 c. Torture
 Mauritanian law prohibits the use of torture and there
 is no evidence that it is practiced.
 d. Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 Except for the executions which followed the 1981 coup
 attempt, there is no recent record of either summary
 executions or of degrading treatment of prisoners. Fol-
 lowing adoption of the Sharia, a murderer convicted by
 Islamic courts after a public trial was executed publicly
 by firing squad; three convicted thieves were punished by
 having their-right hands cut off. Public flogging of
 thieves convicted of petty crimes took place on one occa-
 sion, but in 1982 public punishment has rarely occurred.
 The Government's announcement in July 1980 that slavery was
 abolished in Mauritania drew international attention to
 this complex social and economic phenomenon, with deep
 roots in the country's culture and traditions.. The insti-
 tution persists-largely in Southern Mauritania, where it
 originated in conflicts between nomadic Moors and the
 settled blacks. The Moors gradually exerted their domina-
 tion over some black groups, most of whom originally
 inhabited the Senegal river basin, reducing them to various
 forms of servitude. French colonial administrators out-
 lawed slavery, with little practical effect, in the early
 
 
 204
 part of this century. The abolition of slavery was inclu-
 ded in the Constitution promulgated at independence in
 1960. The July 2, 1980 Declaration of the Abolition of
 Slavery reaffirmed the Mauritanian Government's view that
 the institution of slavery is illegal.
 Although the exact number of slaves in Mauritania is
 unknown, it is believed there are less than 100,000 in the
 country. The status of slaves and the large class of
 descendants of slaves and freed slaves is regulated by
 complex social obligations. Slave owners, for instance,
 provide food and clothing and sometimes guarantee employ-
 ment. On the other hand, many freed slaves must still
 give part of their harvest or wages to their former masters.
 President Haidalla claimed that Islam was opposed to slavery
 in his 1980 speech announcing abolition of the institution.
 Many Moors fear that its extirpation will cause economic
 hardship and serve as a catalyst for the overthrow of other
 traditional institutions.
 While the Mauritanian Government remains firmly and offici-
 ally opposed to slavery, and has named a commission to
 investigate the institution and make recommendations for its
 abolition, forced labor probably still exists in the vast
 and underpopulated country. Government officials claim that
 all workers are always paid, although payment is reputed to
 be made in shelter, clothing, and food. Thus far, the 1980
 declaration of the abolition of slavery can be said to
 represent a firm statement of government intent, but it is
 not possible to judge the extent of its practical effect on
 the institution.
 e. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 The former civilian government decreed that authorities have
 the power to detain anyone whom they judge to be a threat to
 national security. This power of preventive detention is
 still in effect under the ruling military committee. Pre-
 ventive detention has no time limit and there is no right
 of habeas corpus. Detainees are usually confined to their
 residences. Mauritania's ruling military leaders continue
 to make use of this power. Approximately 15 former civilian
 and military officials are currently held under what is, in
 essence, a form of strict surveillance. Other officials
 have been banished to a remote part of the country under
 orders to refrain from political activity. In the fall of
 1979, the Government allowed the most important member of
 the previous regime, ousted President Mokhtar Ould Daddah,
 to travel to France for medical reasons. He reportedly
 remains in France.
 After the signing of the 1979 peace treaty, the Polisario
 continued to hold a large number of Mauritanian prisoners of
 war. The prisoners, at one time believed to number approxi-
 mately 1,000, were reportedly held at Polisario bases in
 Algerian territory.   Reports that black prisoners have been
 mistreated or massacred remain unsubstantiated. It is
 unclear how many, if any, Mauritanians remain prisoners of
 the Polisario.
 f. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The Government is generally committed to providing prompt
 judicial proceedings. An inadequate and underfinanced
 
 
 205
 judicial system means that suspects sometimes are held for
 long periods before trial.
 As part of the Government's campaign to reinforce the
 Islamic character of the nation and to cope with a dramatic
 rise in violent and immoral crime, Sharia law was extended
 to virtually all aspects of Mauritanian life (excepting only
 banking, insurance, and other financial activities) in 1980,
 and further refined on June 25, 1982. Until the present
 Government's action, two legal systems coexisted:  the
 Sharia in the countryside among the nomads and small settlers
 (governing personal and public behavior) and western law in
 government, the capital city of Nouakchott, and smaller
 urban centers. Sharia law as practiced in Mauritania
 covers three types of crime: adultery, personal theft, and
 murder.
 A Mauritanian court consists of a Muslim judge presiding
 over a jury chosen by the governor of the region having
 jurisdiction over the case. The defendant has a right to
 counsel and can appeal a guilty verdict to the Supreme
 Islamic Court within 15 days. Circumstantial evidence
 cannot be admitted as proof of guilt. All sentences must
 be approved by the President.
 g. Invasion of the Home
 The law prohibits such intrusions and there is no evidence
 that violations have occurred.
 2.   Respect for Civil and Political Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Freedom of speech, press, and assembly is restricted.
 Mauritania's only newspaper, news agency, and radio sta-
 tion are government-operated. The editorial content of
 each is controlled, and criticism of government policies
 is not permitted. Foreign newspapers and magazines are
 sold in the major towns and are rarely censored.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Freedom of assembly has been suspended since the military
 assumed control of the country in 1978. Following the
 reorganization of the Committee in April 1979, the Govern-
 ment warned that political assembly, whether in public or
 in individual dwellings, would not be tolerated. At that
 time, and again after the March 16, 1981 coup attempt,
 curfews were imposed to discourage public gatherings.
 Both curfews were lifted within a few months of being
 imposed, but the restriction on political assembly re-
 mains in effect.
 Labor unions are the sole organizations of real or potential
 political power not dissolved after the 1978 military coup.
 Union activity is supervised by the Union of Mauritanian
 Workers, a government organization attached to the Ministry
 of Employment and Training. Union officials state there are
 approximately 27,000 members. Union membership is not uni-
 versal; workers must pay an annual membership fee of $3.75
 to belong. A union is recognized only when it registers
 with the Union of Mauritanian Workers and accepts a Director
 General appointed by it. Union members pay nominal dues,
 
 
 206
 but the Government indirectly finances most union activities.
 As under the Ould Daddah regime, the unions continue to work
 closely with the various ministries. The right to strike
 exists in theory in Mauritania, although no major strikes
 occurred in 1982. However, in April 1982 a few laborers went
 on strike for two days because they had not been paid.
 Their salary demands were met and they returned to work
 immediately.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Islam is the official religion of Mauritania. Although
 almost all citizens are Muslim and the country's official
 name is the Islamic Republic of Mauritania, there are no
 restrictions on personal religious expression in Mauritania.
 However, proselytizing and the construction of churches and
 other non-Islamic houses of worship are not permitted.
 During the past year, some members of the Bahai faith were
 threatened with expulsion for proselytizing. There are no
 reports of religious discrimination in employment.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Free movement is allowed within Mauritania. Foreign
 travel requires a routinely obtainable exit visa from the
 National Police Office. However, some members of the former
 government have been refused permission to leave the country,
 and in some cases, have had their passports confiscated.
 No refugee groups have requested resettlement or safe haven
 in Mauritania. A small number of Mauritanians have left
 the country because of political opposition to the present
 regime.
 e. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Participation in the political process was completely and
 finally ended in 1978 when the military abolished Mauri-
 tania's only political party. At the present time, there
 are no elected representatives, and opposition groups are
 not tolerated.
 In December 1980, President Haidalla announced the first
 step in restoring democratic government in Mauritania.
 A civilian prime minister was appointed, major changes
 were made in the composition of the Government, and a new
 Constitution was promulgated. However, since the coup
 attempt in March 1981, these steps toward democratization
 have halted. A military prime minister was appointed and
 steps toward a return to constitutional rule remained
 suspended in 1982.
 There was an increase in political mobilization in 1982,
 although not meaningful political participation, through a
 movement of "mass education" structures (Structures d'Educa-
 tion de Masses). The Committee has emphasized themes of
 decentralized administration with greater development
 responsibilities assigned to the governors of each region.
 The "structures" are striving for more popular participation
 and increased awareness of development problems through
 nationwide mobilization of the population. Chief of State
 and President of the Committee Haidalla heads these struc-
 
 
 207
 tures, with other members of the Committee and senior
 administrators as principal leaders.
 Although the black population is represented at all levels
 of government, many blacks claim the Moors are substantially
 overrepresented in government and religious institutions,
 since blacks believe they constitute a majority of the
 population. The Government insists, however, that a
 substantial majority of Mauritanians are Moors. Few
 reliable figures exist to buttress the arguments of
 either group.
 3.   Government Attitude Regarding International and Non-
 governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations of
 Human Rights.
 Amnesty International has requested that the Government
 of Mauritania provide information concerning the detention
 of several former members of the Government. Although the
 Mauritanian Government never formally responded to the
 Amnesty International inquiries, the officials in question
 were apparently released from detention in July 1981. In
 its 1982 report, Amnesty included among its main human
 rights concerns in Mauritania detention and banishment
 without charge or trial, what Amnesty termed unfair trials
 of alleged opponents of the Government, and judicially-
 ordered amputations and floggings.
 In August 1981, the UN Human Rights Subcommission's working
 group on slavery heard a report from the Anti-slavery
 Society on slavery in Mauritania. The report accused the
 Mauritanian Government of taking no action to abolish
 slavery beyond the 1980 Declaration declaring it illegal.
 A Mauritanian observer at the session criticized the
 report, saying that the information had been badly analyzed,
 and invited the subcommission to send an expert of its own
 to investigate the situation first-hand. The subcommission
 in September recommended that the Human Rights Commission
 accept the invitation, although no visit had taken place
 as of late 1982.
 The Mauritanian Embassy in Paris issued a protest against
 the report, contending that social ties formed over centu-
 ries cannot be effaced all at once. The Embassy further
 expressed dismay that the Anti-slavery Society had not
 offered Mauritania any assistance in working toward the
 suppression of slavery in the country.
 4. Economic, Social, and Cultural Situation
 Mauritanian economic growth has been slow. Few resources
 in Mauritania have been successfully exploited. Iron ore
 still accounts for 85 percent of the country's exports.
 Growth has been hindered by poor planning, increasing debt,
 and high import prices for food and energy. The severe
 drought of the 1970's, coupled with the war in the Western
 Sahara, has contributed to a rapid population shift to
 urban areas. Cities are overcrowded, meager government
 services cannot meet the elementary needs of the people,
 and industrial development lags far behind the size
 of the labor force. Education and health services are
 limited, as reflected in an 11 percent literacy rate and
 a 17 percent infant mortality rate.
 
 
 208
 Rural Mauritanians must battle the drought and cope with
 the slow disappearance of their traditional nomadic life-
 style. Government attempts to provide more services to the
 rural sector are hampered by the country's very low popula-
 tion density. Strong nomadic family traditions continue to
 provide the basis for support of the unemployed and elderly
 Small business enterprises are an important part of
 Mauritania's economy; small stands and shops flourish in
 the towns. The Government dominates large-scale industry,
 however, and nearly all major services and utilities are
 run by partially state-owned firms.
 There is a large difference in income between the tradi-
 tional subsistence (small farming and herding) and modern
 sectors (mining, commercial fishing, and government).
 The tax system is progressive, although few Mauritanians
 pay their true tax assessments. Private property rights
 at the personal level are respected.
 In education, the Government's task is complicated by the
 very sharp divisions between the Arabic-speaking Moorish
 population and the blacks, who have traditionally preferred
 to be educated in French and local languages rather than in
 Arabic. The Government recently abandoned plans for total
 Arabization of the educational system after encountering
 widespread opposition.
 Traditional cultural and social values limit the role of
 Mauritanian women in government and business. Some women
 have risen to prominent positions in the fields of health
 and education, and many women are employed as teachers and
 middle or low-level government bureaucrats. Statistics
 indicate that only half as many women as men avail them-
 selves of educational opportunities, a phenomenon which
 may be due to cultural, rather than legal, constraints.
 Female circumcision still exists in most of Mauritania.
 More than 90 percent of Mauritania's women still undergo
 this traditional practice.
