 DOMINICAN REPUBLIC
 The Dominican Republic is a constitutional democracy with a
 popularly elected president and a bicameral congress. The
 Supreme Court heads an independent judiciary whose members are
 appointed by the Senate. The military is fully responsive to
 civilian authority and committed to the constitutional order.
 Parties representing the ideological spectrum from left to
 right freely and actively participated in the May 1986 national
 elections, the sixth consecutive elections since 1966. The
 current President, Joaquin Balaguer Ricardo, was inaugurated
 in August 1986; elections are next scheduled for May 1990.
 The Dominican Republic has a mixed economy based primarily on
 agriculture and services. The Government accounts for 20 to
 25 percent of the gross domestic product and controls several
 major industries. Historically, sugar has been the principal
 export, although both tourism and remittances from Dominicans
 abroad now generate more foreign exchange. The country
 continues to face the burdens of a weighty external debt,
 rapidly-growing population, and concommitant high levels of
 unemployment, underemployment, and surging inflation.
 During 1987 Dominicans continued to exercise and enjoy the
 broad range of human rights provided by the 1966 Constitution.
 The political environment remained unrestricted, and
 individuals and political groups freely debated and criticized
 the Government's policies and programs. Discontent over
 increasing prices, wage levels, and deteriorating basic public
 services generated a series of popular protests and local
 strikes which culminated in a 24-hour general strike on July
 28. The conviction of some officials of the previous
 administration for corruption generated charges of political
 persecution and executive interference with the judiciary.
 The Government denied the charges.
 A second human rights issue which generated criticism and
 allegations of abuse within the Dominican Republic was the
 government operation which picked up illegal Haitian residents
 and offered them a choice between a contract to cut sugarcane
 or face deportation to Haiti.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section I Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There were no known cases of government-instigated political
 killings in 1987. The January 1985 murder case of foreign
 exchange trader Hector Mendez and his chauffeur, in which
 there were allegations of government and police involvement,
 remained before the courts.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no credible reports of politically motivated
 disappearances in 1987.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 The Constitution prohibits torture, and it is not practiced.
 Excesses on the part of law enforcement officials have
 occurred, and the press routinely reports cases of alleged
 
 
 459
 DOMINICAN REPUBLIC
 police abuse. Access'to the press by prisoners and their
 families encourages the G&vernment to take corrective action.
 Government and police officials have indicated a concern to
 redress improper bbhavior by police but have not always
 effected the needed changes. As in previous years, there were
 several cases in 1987"in which individual members of the
 police were accused of beating suspects. In July three police
 officers were arrested for the shooting death of a student
 during a dembnstrati6n in the provincial capital of San
 Francisco de Macoris.
 The inadequately financed prison system suffers from
 unsanitary conditions. Many prisoners remain in prison for
 lengthy peiiods while awaiting trial because of the slowness
 of the judicial process.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, Exile, or F6rced Labor
 There are no known instances of arbitrary arrest, illegal
 detention, or exile of persons for expressing views contrary
 to or critical of the Government. The Constitution stipulates
 that suspects may be detained fbr a maximum of 48 hours for
 investigation before arraignmint, after which they must be
 charged or released. This requirement is generally observed.
 Forced or compulsory labor is prohibited by law.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 There are no known political prisoners."The Constitution
 provides for.a public trial. No special court for political
 or natioial security cases exists, and civilians may not be
 tried biy a military court. "Members of the Armed Forces are
 tried by military courts,, except under specified circumstances
 and only after rdview by a military board. The appeals
 procedure, which includes appellate courts and the Supreme
 Court, is wi'diely utilfzed. Court-appointed lawyers normally
 are provided at public expense to indigents only in criminal
 cases; they are seldom provided in criminal misdemeanor cases
 where their provision is at the court's discretion.
 Prosecuting attorneys are aipointed by the executive branch.
 Judges at'all levels are appointed and approved by the
 Senate. They are nominally independent of the executive'
 branch and are subject to removal or transfer by a majority
 vote in'the Senate. Their terms of office correspond roughly
 to that of the President and other elected officials, ending
 when the newly elected Senate designates their replacements
 (or reconfirms them). Judges earn a relatively low salary,
 and the fairness and timeliness of some trials have been
 subject to allegations of influence and manipulation. There
 is a widespread public belief that a number of judges and
 prosecutors at the lower court level accept bribes.
 The slowness of the judicial system, a problem for many years,
 has come under criticism from several sectors. Although the
 right to judicial determination of the legality of detention
 exists, preventive detention of those'awaiting trial is legal
 and commonly employed. A recent study indicated that over 85
 percent of those incarcerated in the country's prisons are
 still awaiting trial, including many who have spent years in
 jail.
 The prosecution and imprisonment of several members of the
 previous bdministration on a variety of corruption charges was
 
 
 460
 DOMINICAN REPUBLIC
 accompanied by charges of executive influence over the
 judiciary to discredit and politically undermine the
 opposition. In addition to charges of political persecution,
 there have been criticisms about delays, inflexibility, and
 harshness in the judicial proceedings of those accused in
 corruption cases, some of whom have been held for 10 months
 without bail and without the commencement of their trials. In
 December, however, the majority of those former officials
 charged in various corruption cases were released on bail.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 There were no reports of arbitrary governmental interference
 in the private lives of individuals or families.
 Constitutional safeguards against invasion of the home
 normally are observed. A residence may not be searched except
 in the presence of a prosecutor or an assistant prosecutor,
 excluding cases of "hot pursuit" or in instances where there
 is probable cause to believe that a crime is actually in
 process in the residence. There were allegations that some of
 the illegal Haitians rounded up by the military in November
 and December were removed from their homes and forcibly
 relocated.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 These liberties are provided for by law and are respected in
 practice. Dominican newspapers are privately owned and freely
 reflect opposition points of view and criticism of the current
 Government. The numerous privately owned radio and television
 stations air all political points of view. Moreover,
 government officials and the media frequently exchange views.
 There is no government censorship on political grounds. In
 March marshals and police, misinterpreting a court order,
 occupied the premises of a television station, owned by a
 close collaborator of the previous Government, and began to
 seize equipment. The operation was halted by the District
 Attorney shortly after it began, but the station's equipment
 suffered significant damage. The District Attorney explained
 that the marshals misunderstood a court order to freeze the
 assets of another company located at the same address and
 owned by the same man. Subsequently the President, denying
 the Government had prior knowledge of the seizure, ordered an
 investigation and reiterated the Government's commitment to
 basic civil and political freedoms and human rights.
 While customs authorities from time to time confiscate
 Communist literature at ports of entry, books of all political
 persuasions are readily available for public sale. University
 autonomy and -academic freedom are respected-by the Government.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 These freedoms are provided for by the Constitution and are
 respected in practice. Outdoor public marches and meetings
 require government permits, which are routinely granted.
 Indoor gatherings of political parties, labor unions, and
 other associations are unrestricted.
 Labor unions historically have not played a central role in
 the Dominican Republic; less than 15 percent of the labor
 force is organized. The trade union movement is fragmented
 
 
 461
 DOMINICAN REPUBLIC
 into numerous national labor confederations, most of which are
 highly p9liticized." Moreover, the confederations exercise
 only a limited degree of control over their affiliates.
 Several of the confederations are-affiliated with regional and
 international labor organiz ations. A significant portion of
 organized labor is Communist controlled or influenced. The
 politically affiliated organizations'frequently pursue
 partisan political objectives as much as workers' economic
 demands. Rising unemployment (nearly 30 percent) and the
 nation's weak economy have hampered the growth of organized
 labor.
 Unions have theiright to'bargain collectively and to strike
 but operate under the handicap of a dated labor code, written
 durinq'theLTrujillo dictatorship (1930-51). For example,
 unions haveFew'rights vis-a-vis management, and there is no
 effective protectioh for organizers or union officials. Labor
 leaders and others were freely permitted to organize and
 conduct a 'tionwide general strike on July 28. as well as
 other protests.- The July 28 strike was essentially peaceful;
 however, violence did erupt in-several places. One man was
 killed in a clash between police and protestors in Santo
 Domingo. Protestorp blocked some streets with garbage and
 burning tires..
 Prior.to the July 28 strike, summer pr6tests over poor social
 conditions and demands for improved public services also
 degenerated-into violence in some instances. Police and
 security1.fp0es *reactqd in a,measured fashi6n'in the majority
 of such incioens..'
 Professional. organizations of lawyers, doctors, journalists,
 and others function freely.  Like the unions, these
 organizations are free to maintain relations with 'counterpart
 international bodies of diverse political philosophies.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Discrimination on religious grounds is prohibited by the
 Constitution. There are no religious requirements to hold
 public office, no restrictions on the practice of religious
 faiths, and no social discrimination based on religion.
 However-, approximately 95 percent of the population is Roman
 Catholic, and the Church's preeminent position, accepted by'
 the populace at large, is ,recognized in the Concordat between
 the Dominican Republic and the Holy See.
 On April 28 and 29, Mormon properties in Santo Domingo and
 five other provincial 6apitals were attacked with homemade
 bombs. Church sources reported that there were no injuries
 and that damage.to'the various facilities was not extensive.
 The media speculated that fhese attacks were related to the
 22nd anniversary of the U.S. military intervention in the
 Dominican Republic.
 d. treedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 There are no unusual restrictions on travel within or outside
 the country. Many political exiles returned after a 1978
 amnesty, but a specific legal ban on the return of certain
 members of the family of Rafael Trujillo, a former dictator,
 still exists.
 
 
 462
 DOMINICAN REPUBLIC
 The status and treatment of Haitians living in the Dominican
 Republic have been criticized by the press and private groups,
 both in the Dominican Republic and abroad. The Haitian
 community of approximately 500,000 is composed mainly of
 illegal immigrants. Over the years, many have come on labor
 contracts to cut sugarcane. Among Haitians in the Dominican
 Republic were 800 persons, mostly opponents of former Haitian
 President Duvalier, who had received political refugee status
 from the Dominican Government. In addition, there were
 another 1,000 de facto (but not officially recognized)
 political refugees. After the fall of the Duvalier regime in
 February 1986, the United Nations High Commissioner for
 Refugees (UNHCR), in cooperation with the Dominican and
 Haitian Governments, arranged to assist refugees, both
 registered and unregistered, requesting voluntary repatriation
 back to Haiti. In all, since 1986 some 3,000 persons have
 been repatriated to Haiti with UNHCR assistance; many more
 have returned unassisted. Less than 250 officially recognized
 political refugees remain in the Dominican Republic, although
 UNHRC officials believe many more might be eligible for
 refugee status.
 Illegal immigrants are routinely deported under Dominican
 immigration law, while those seeking political refuge are not
 repatriated if the Government determines that they have a
 legitimate fear of persecution. In November and December, the
 military engaged in roundups of Haitians allegedly residing
 illegally in the Dominican Republic. Several hundred Haitians
 were detained and relocated to state-owned sugar mills where
 they were allegedly registered and offered a choice between a
 contract to cut sugarcane or face deportation to Haiti. It is
 not known how many were actually repatriated. A few domestic
 human rights groups expressed concern -that such actions may
 have impinged on the legal and human rights of Dominicans of
 Haitian descent as well as Haitians residing legally in the
 Dominican Republic.
 The Constitution requires that all foreigners abstain from
 political activities in the Dominican Republic.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 The Dominican Republic is a functioning multiparty democracy
 in which governments are freely elected by the citizenry.
 Opposition groups of the left, right, and center operate
 openly and participated in the 1986 elections in which nearly
 three-quarters of the registered electorate voted, selecting
 national, provincial, and municipal office holders. The large
 voter turnout and active participation of the three principal
 parties (the ruling Social Christian Reformist Party, the
 Dominican Revolutionary Party, and the Dominican Liberation
 Party), in the Dominican Congress underline the favorable
 climate for political pluralism.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The access of international human rights organizations is
 unrestricted. Responding to criticism that the Government is
 using the courts to persecute members of the previous
 administration, the Legal Advisor to the President asserted in
 September that international human rights organizations could
 visit the country to assure legal due process is respected.
 
 
 463
 DOMINICAN REPUBLIC-
 Private organizations which freely report and comment on human
 rights include the Dominican Human Rights'Committee, the
 Dominican Union for the Defense of Human Rights, and the
 National Committee of Human and Labor Rights. These
 organizations, as in the past, have criticized the treatment
 of Haitian canecutters (both residents and migrant workers) in
 the sugarcane fields.
 The Dominican Republic participates actively in international
 and regional human rights bodies and supports efforts to
 promote human rights in international forums.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Sexual and racial discrimination are prohibited by law, and
 women's political rights have been recognized in legislation
 since 1941. Forty-seven percent of registered voters ake
 women, and women hold both elective and appointed offices in
 the Government. President Balaguer designated women governors
 for 8 of the country's 29 provinces. Divorce is easily
 obtainable by either spouse, and women can hold property in
 their own names apart from their husbands. Nonetheless, women
 trditionally have not shared equal social and economic status
 or opportunity with men. There is subtle social discrimination
 against darker-skinned Dominicans, although this has not
 prevented their success in a variety of fields, including
 elected political office. Dominicans, for historical reasons
 and because of sharp cultural differences, generally are
 prejudiced against Haitians. This prejudice carries over to a
 minority of Dominicans in the population who are of Haitian
 descent.
 CONDITIONS OF LABOR
 The Dominican labor code prohibits employment of youths under
 14 years of age and restricts the nighttime employment of
 youths aged 14-18. The labor code also provides that
 employees under 18 work no more than 8 hours a day and
 specifies that those 18 years and younger may not be employed
 in dangerous or unhealthy jobs. In practice, many of the
 iestrictions in the labor code are ignored, and young people,
 including minors less than 14 years old, engage in a wide
 variety of work which violates labor regulations.
 The labor code establishes that ail workers are entitled to 24
 hours of rest after 6 days of work; in practice, a typical
 workweek is Monday through Friday plus half a day on
 Saturday. Safety and health conditions at the workplace do
 not always meet acceptable standards. The Government's
 ability to enforce all aspects of its labor legislation is
 limited by manpower and resource constraints. The existing
 social security system is inadequate; In 1987 the Government,
 responding to workers' demands, took steps to raise the basic
 minimum monthly salary from 250 to 350 pesos (about $62 to
 $88) for private sector employees. Some smaller businesses
 and agricultural workers are exempt from the new pay scale.
 The minimum wage of public sector employees was increased from
 250 to 275 pesos (about $62 to $69) with an additional
 increase to 300 pesos (about $75) scheduled for January 1988.
 There was no contract between the Governments of Haiti and the
 Dominican Republic to bring in Haitian canecutters for the
 1987 harvest. As in the'past, however, human rights groups
 and other organizations charged that Haitian laborers in the
 
 
 464
 DOMINICAN REPUBLIC
 sugarcane fields were subject to substandard living and
 working conditions.  .
