 VIETNAM
 The Socialist Republic of Vietnam is a dictatorship controlled
 by the Vietnamese Communist Party. The Communist Party took
 power in the north after a long war against France and
 non-Communist Vietnamese nationalists, culminating in the 1954
 partition of the country. The current elderly leadership is
 essentially the group which fought the war of independence and
 subsequently through force of arms took over the southern
 Republic of Vietnam in 1975, thereby placing the entire country
 under its political control.
 Hanoi has formally denied the normal rights of Vietnamese
 citizens as well as working papers and ration coupons to many
 of its citizens deemed politically unacceptable; many former
 1reeducation camp" inmates and others without official jobs are
 forced to live precariously in an underground economy. Many in'
 the South depend for their survival on aid from relatives
 abroad. The Government has continued the trend of closely
 watching, and in some cases repressing, religious groups. The
 regime has not accepted the American offer to accept political
 prisoners in "reeducation camps" for resettlement in the United
 States. Its security organs continued to crush any hint of
 opposition to the regime.
 Vietnam's continuing occupation of Cambodia contributes to
 major human rights abuses there and diverts resources from
 reconstruction in Vietnam. Violations of human rights in
 Cambodia by Vietnam's client, the puppet government of the
 so-called People's Republic of Kampuchea (PRK), have included
 executions, forced labor, denial of legal process, forced
 relocations, and arbitrary arrest. At the same time, Vietnam's
 dispute with China, resulting partly from its Cambodian
 adventure, forces it to maintain a large army on its northern
 border. Vietnam also maintains significant forces in Laos in
 order to keep the Lao Government, which it dominates, in
 power. These policies have left Vietnam with an army of over 1
 million men.
 Vietnam is a poor, underdeveloped, agricultural country faced
 with the problem of feeding a large population (60 million),
 with many of its most talented people having fled overseas. At
 the same time, it is attempting to impose a Soviet-style
 Marxist-Leninist political and economic system on a populace in
 the south with a different value system and questionable
 loyalty to the current regime. Most citizens live barely above
 subsistence level, although Vietnam has claimed that it is now
 able to meet minimum food requirements. Food is rationed or
 highly priced on the free market.
 Thousands of residents of southern Vietnam seek escape from the
 severe repression imposed upon them by the authorities in Hanoi
 and from the bleak prospects caused by the Government's effort
 to impose a Communist economy on a once vigorous free market.
 The more fortunate are able to leave under the Orderly
 Departure Program of the United Nations High Commissioner for
 Refugee's (UNHRC). Other thousands, however, have set off in
 small boats for neighboring countries. Many in this lattez
 group have lost their lives to the hazards of the sea,
 Vietnamese gunboats, or pirates.
 There was no improvement in the dismal human rights situation
 in Vietnam during 1985, and no amelioration of economic,
 social, or political conditions.

 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 The Government acknowledges that a number of persons whom it
 considered "war criminals" were executed in the wake of the
 1975 takeover. Former inmates of reeducation camps have
 reported summary executions for escape attempts and resistance
 to camp authorities. One study of such reports has concluded
 that since the fall of Saigon such executions number in the
 tens of thousands. Attacks by minority and ethnic Vietnamese
 resistance groups against Government authority usually target
 People's Army of Vietnam units, but they sometimes attack
 public security or administrative officials. Although accurate
 figures are not available, the number of deaths caused by these
 activities appears to be small.
 b. Disappearance
 Though disappearances, apparently officially authorized, of
 Vietnamese citizens occured in the period immediately following
 the Communist takeover of the South, no reports of such
 disappearances have been received in recent years.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Reports from refugees are consistent concerning the severity of
 the conditions for prisoners in reeducation camps. In these
 camps, provision of food rations below subsistence levels,
 denial of medical care, and assignment of hard labor to
 prisoners have been regularly practiced. Prisoners are
 punished severely for minor infractions of camp rules. For
 example, a minor infraction could be punished by several months
 solitary confinement. These practices can result in acute
 suffering, permanent physical impairment, and death. Inmates
 have indeterminate sentences and face the prospect of
 indefinite penal labor. In addition to common criminals, these
 camps contain former officials and military officers of the
 Republic of Vietnam, many of them aged, and people arrested for
 political reasons since the Communist takeover. Included are
 chaplains and clergy from both Buddhist and Christian groups,
 intellectuals, and former political leaders. Persons
 imprisoned for attempting to flee from Vietnam have reported
 that beatings of inmates during interrogation have resulted in
 death. A former inmate in a prison for people who have
 attempted to leave Vietnam illegally has stated that prisoners
 who refused to obey guards' orders had been executed.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Suspects may be apprehended on a warrant, which stipulates the
 nature of the crime and which permits detention for 2 months
 prior to trial. An extension for a further 2-month detention
 can be obtained upon application to higher authorities. There
 is no provision for bail, nor access to a defense lawyer prior
 to trial. When they deem it necessary, public security
 officials may apprehend and search suspects without a warrant.
 Such people may be held for an indefinite period, and there is
 no right to habeas corpus. Refugees report that the
 authorities sometimes wait several months before notifying
 relatives of arrests.
 
 
 895
 VIETNAM
 Those suspected of political crimes may be sent to reeducation
 camps without trial or charge. The Government continues to
 hold thousands of people without trial in such camps, including
 both those whom the Government distrusts because of their
 association with the former Republic of Vietnam, and those
 whose current political views are suspect. These camps remove
 dissident elements from society, particularly competent and/or
 charismatic leaders. The camps attempt to produce conformity
 through confinement, fear, hard labor, self-criticism, and a
 minimum amount of indoctrination. While several thousand
 prisoners have been released, including officers up to the rank
 of colonel (and a handful of generals, most in the medical
 services), some have been rearrested. The Government claims
 that the number of people still detained in its reeducation
 camps since 1975 is on the order of 7,000. Critics of the
 regime maintain that the real number is considerably higher.
 Forced labor has been used by Vietnamese and local authorities
 in Cambodia for projects to build barriers along the
 Thai-Cambodian border and to improve the logistical
 infrastructure for Vietnamese occupation troops.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 For those Vietnamese who are given a trial, for the most part
 those charged with nonpolitical crimes or specific prohibited
 political acts, the judicial process cannot be considered fair
 to the accused. In general, the entire legal system operates
 as an agency for the enforcement of regime directives; it has
 no independence from political intervention.
 In addition to those detained without trial in reeducation
 camps, there a:e also a number of people who have been charged,
 tried, and executed for conspiring to overthrow the Government
 or for other political crimes. In December 1984, 21 persons
 were put on trial for espionage in Ho Chi Minh City (formerly
 Saigon). The appointed defense attorney was quoted during the
 proceedings as saying, "they violated the law and nobody can
 defend them because they are traitors." Five of the accused
 were found guilty and sentenced to death. Three of them were
 executed on January 8, 1985. The other two had their sentences
 commuted to life imprisonment. One hundred more suspects are
 reported to be under arrest. There is no reliable estimate of
 the number of such political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 There is a pervasive system of population surveillance by
 party-appointed local wardens, who use informants to keep track
 of each person's political and economic activities. The system
 works imperfectly in the South, however, partly because of a
 shortage of trusted party workers. There have been reports of
 officials and even unofficial security wardens conducting
 without warrants midnight searches of homes for draft-age males
 in order to fill draft quotas. There continue to be reliable
 reports that the Interior Ministry inspects and sometimes
 confiscates international mail and packages sent to Vietnam,
 particularly to politically suspect people or those of Chinese
 origin. Outgoing mail is also subject to inspection and
 censorship.
 The regime has widely publicized its program to relocate
 millions of people to "new economic zones" in virgin or
 
 
 896
 VIETNAM
 unproductive rural areas in order to expand agricultural
 production. Hundreds of thousands were resettled in these
 remote zones in the south in the years immediately following
 the fall of South.Vietnam. The resettlement process has
 involved forms of coercion in most cases. It targeted for
 resettlement those whose views and background made them
 politically suspect and often unable to find employment.
 Conditions in these zones are widely reported to range from
 poor to life-threatening with inadequate provision of basic
 services. Many of those so relocated have left the zones,
 returning to the cities where they are forced to live on an
 already marginal economy, without the ration or neighborhood
 registration cards essential to procuring employment, food, and
 other essential services. Without these documents they can be
 arrested arbitrarily and returned to the new economic zone.
 The Government continues its relocation program, despite its
 cost in human suffering. The 1981-85 plan calls for the
 relocation of 1 million people. A Ministry of Labor official
 claimed in August, 1985, that the 1985 goal of relocating
 200,000 workers would be met. The official rationale for this
 massive dislocation of people is increased economic production,
 particularly of cash crops such as coffee and rubber. Although
 the Government speaks of "volunteers" when discussing people
 resettled in these zones, it is clear that arbitrary
 resettlement interferes with a person's right to live in a
 place of his own choosing.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Freedom of speech and of the press does not exist in Vietnam.
 The Ministry of Culture and Information and organs of the party
 control the distribution of all newspapers, books, and other
 publications, as well as all cultural exhibitions. The
 Government controls and censors all public sources of
 information and promotes "revolutionary culture" in the arts.
 Many prominent artists and writers have been arrested.
 Refugees have reported that the Government has implemented
 electronic jamming against the short-wave radio operated by a
 Vietnamese resistance group which broadcasts into Vietnam.
 Independent criticism of the party and Government is not
 permitted. Self-censorship by journalists operates without
 question, given the pervasive control of the party.
 The block surveillance system uses informants to monitor the
 activities of citizens. Public criticism of officials is not
 permitted and does not occur, except in official news media
 when criticizing the performance of some officials or groups of
 officials who do not meet current party objectives.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Public or private meetings to criticize or protest government
 actions or policies are prohibited. Nongovernmental
 organizations, such as church groups, can meet for narrowly
 defined objectives, such as church services, but not for other
 purposes.
 In lieu of independent labor unions, government-controlled
 unions have been set up under the Vietnam Federation of Trade
 Unions, an organization completely controlled by the Communist
 
 
 897
 VIETNAM
 party. Claiming 3 million members, the Federation's stated
 goal is to increase party control and production, rather than
 to improve workers' welfare or to protect their rights. There
 is no right to bargain collectively or to strike.
 Other "mass organizations," such as the Women's Federations,
 exist in the various sectors of the population. They perform
 the same functions of control, propaganda, and policy
 dissemination within their respective sectors as does the Trade
 Union Federation among workers. They are grouped into the
 Vietnam Fatherland Front.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 The Government tolerates the existence of religious groups and
 allows religious services but has consistently attempted to
 divide and control the Catholic, Buddhist, and Cao Dai
 religions, the Islamic community, and other religious groups.
 The Government perceives them as potential seedbeds of
 subversion and political opposition. It has attempted to
 prevent their growth and to inhibit proselytizing activities
 by, among other things, prohibiting publication of religious
 materials and severely limiting the training and mobility of
 clergy. The Government has attempted to coopt religious groups
 by promoting parallel organizations and leaders who are
 subservient to it.
 Refugees have reported constant harassment of the Catholic
 Church by government authorities. Sermons require government
 approval. Uncooperative priests are subject to confinement in
 remote villages or incarceration in "reeducation camps." Many
 priests have been arrested, or are under house arrest. There
 are reportedly more than 100 priests detained in "reeducation
 camps," and most former South Vietnamese military chaplains of
 all religions have remained in prison since 1975. Catholic
 priests and nuns are subject to police surveillance, and most
 of them are required by the authorities to work full time in
 secular occupations, thus limiting their participation in
 religious activities. The teaching role of the Church has been
 severely restricted, and many churches and all but one Catholic
 seminary in the south have been closed; reportedly, no priest
 has been ordained since 1980. The Government has restricted
 communication between rural parishes and their bishops. It
 also prohibits the printing of Bibles or their importation.
 Authorities routinely cut lists of parishioners applying to
 attend services by at least half, and an individual can attend
 only the church at which he is registered. Catholics are
 required to register as such with the authorities and are
 discriminated against in employment although Buddhists are
 not. "Voluntary" work and other required activities are
 scheduled by the authorities during times of regular church
 services. As a result of this harassment, the size of Catholic
 congregations has shrunk steadily since 1975. In central
 Vietnam, thousands of Catholics have been forcibly relocated
 and made to work on government construction projects.
 Protestant churches have been similarly restricted. Church
 buildings have been taken over by the authorities under various
 pretexts. Churches in the highlands (where most Protestants
 are located) have all been closed, as was the sole Protestant
 college and theological seminary. There have been continued
 reports of harassment among those evangelical churches which
 have been allowed--albeit within narrow limits--to continue to
 hold services in urban areas.
 
 
 898
 VIETNAM
 Most of the 30,000 Vietnamese Muslims are members of the Cham
 minority, which the regime distrusts and harasses. Links
 between the Cham, Khmer Krom (ethnic Khmer living in Vietnam)
 and hill tribes (Montagnards) have created the only sizable
 resistance movement in Vietnam: the United Liberation Front of
 Oppressed Races, or FULRO. In its repression of the Cham the
 Government has eliminated the position of Mufti, or Islamic
 religious leader, within the Muslim communities; disbanded the
 organized Islamic association; and forced them to sever their
 links with overseas Islamic organizations. The regime forbids
 pilgrimage to Mecca and has not given permission for the
 Islamic community to participate in the Koran reading contest
 held annually in Malaysia. Many Islamic schools have been
 closed but most mosques remain open. Importation of Korans is
 forbidden and the Koran printing house has been closed.
 About half of Vietnam's 60 million people are Buddhists, the
 great majority of them Mahayana. The authorities have tried
 repeatedly since 1975 to suppress and intimidate the Mahayana
 Buddhist leadership. They have closed temples and transformed
 them into public buildings. They have arrested monks
 intermittently since 1975, and hundreds remain in reeducation
 camps. Many monks remain under house arrest, and the travel of
 those not under detention is severely restricted. Some reports
 allege that local authorities seek to control the community of
 Buddhist monks by forbidding the donation of food. The
 majority of pre-1975 monks in the south have been forced to
 leave the monkhood, and few young men are allowed to join the
 community. Teaching of seminarians must often be conducted in
 secret, -and pagoda schools have been closed. Monks of the
 formerly politically active An Quang, Xa Loi, and Vinh Nghiem
 pagodas are kept under close government surveillance and are
 rarely allowed visitors. The regime established the Unified
 Vietnam Buddhist Church as "the only Buddhist organization
 representing Vietnamese Buddhism in all other relations in the
 country and with other countries," but this organization
 reportedly has no appeal to most Buddhists.
 Most of Vietnam's Therevada Buddhists are Khmer Krom. This
 group, which numbers about 800,000 people living in southern
 and southwestern Vietnam, has provided the Vietnamese army of
 occupation in Cambodia with interpreters and staff for its
 military government. Nevertheless, the Khmer Krom remain
 distrusted by the Vietnamese, partly for historical reasons. A
 number of former Therevada leaders have been imprisoned.
 Other religious groups have also been persecuted by the
 regime. The Hoa Hao (a Buddhist sect) strongly resisted the
 Communist takeover. As a result, the Government violently
 repressed the sect and arrested virtually all of its leaders.
 The regime maintains tight control over Hoa Hao areas.
 Similarly, the regime has arrested many of the leaders of the
 Cao Dai (a uniquely Vietnamese religion comprising elements of
 Buddhism, Islam and Christianity). Refugees have reported
 police occupation of the Cao Dai Holy See in Tay Ninh City.
 Since the regime views religion as a possible source of
 political opposition, adherence to a religious group is
 incompatible with membership in the Communist Party. Party
 membership is a prerequisite for advancement in society.
 
 
 899
 VIETNAM
 d.   Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation.
 Government approval is required for all external travel, and an
 identity card is required for internal travel. No one is
 allowed to change his residence or work location without
 permission from the authorities. Since public security cadre
 periodically check household occupants against the official
 family register, unauthorized absences also subject families to
 surveillance and harassment. With few exceptions, only
 government officials or approved spokesmen for
 quasi-governmental organizations receive permission to travel
 abroad.
 Many factors, in addition to the generally repressive political
 situation, have caused a mass exodus from Vietnam since 1975.
 Among them are ethnic and religious persecution, discrimination
 with regard to economic and educational opportunities, fear of
 imprisonment or of forced resettlement in remote areas, and
 fear of conscription to fight in Cambodia.
 Vietnam's program to "facilitate" the departure of ethnic
 Chinese and others as refugees, which led in the spring of 1979
 to an exodus of over 40,000 a month by boat, was apparently
 suspended in July 1979. Information from refugees who have left
 Vietnam since then indicates that the authorities are no longer
 officially assisting such departures. In May 1979 the UNHCR
 reached agreement with the Government on the legal departure of
 people from Vietnam under the Orderly Departure Program. This
 program started slowly but in fiscal year 1984, 28,340 people
 left Vietnam under the program, and in fiscal year 1985 the
 number was 28,478. A significant number of these are ethnic
 Chinese who consistently find it easier than ethnic Vietnamese
 to obtain official approval for departure. Another significant
 portion is composed of children fathered by Americans in
 Vietnam, known as "Amerasians." The Government wants them to
 leave, and they are often subject to discrimination in Vietnam.
 Refugees continued to leave Vietnam clandestinely, although at
 a reduced rate compared to past years. They leave because of a
 combination of political, economic, and personal factors.
 Hanoi radio has broadcast reports of executions or of lengthy
 jail sentences for organizers of failed escape attempts, as
 well as of punishments dealt to others implicated. Currently,
 men can expect sentences ranging from 3 to 15 years at hard
 labor--depending on their role in the departure attempt--while
 women receive I to 3. months, with childless women often
 receiving longer sentences. Those released from reeducation
 camps who attempt flight can expect to be returned to the camps
 for an indefinite term. Property, often including the means of
 livelihood, is confiscated from those caught trying to escape.
 During the past few years there have been credible reports of
 Vietnamese patrol boats firing upon and sinking helpless
 refugee boats attempting to flee clandestinely. Hundreds of
 refugees reportedly have been killed and others captured and
 imprisoned as a result of these attacks.
 In order to be placed on Orderly Departure Program lists,
 people must often bribe officials. Refugees from the Mekong
 Delta have reported that some people have paid officials from
 4,800 to 6,000 dollars in gold per person to be placed on
 tentative lists with no guarantee as to when or if they would
 be permitted to leave. People who have applied for exit
 permits reportedly are subject to recurring security checks and
 harassment.
 
 
 900
 VIETNAM
 Few have returned to Vietnam after having fled the country.
 Those who left in the immediate aftermath of the fall of South
 Vietnam in 1975 and later returned were incarcerated in
 reeducation camps. In only a few isolated cases has Hanoi
 allowed anyone to repatriate in recent years; in effect, those
 who emigrate lose their citizenship. However, some people who
 have acquired nationalities and travel documents of other
 countries have been permitted to return to Vietnam as visitors.
 Since the occupation of Cambodia by Vietnam, large numbers of
 Vietnamese, possibly as many as several hundred thousand, have
 settled in Cambodia. Although many of these people are former
 residents expelled by Cambodia's former rulers, a significant
 number are reportedly first-time settlers.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 All authority and political power in Vietnam is vested in the
 Communist party, and political opposition to or advocacy of
 change in this system is not tolerated. The Politburo of the
 Central Committee of the Communist Party of Vietnam is the
 supreme decisionmaking body in the nation, and the party's
 Secretariat oversees day-to-day implementation of Politburo
 directives. The party leadership selects candidates for the
 Central Committee, and the periodic national party Congresses
 merely ratify the selection without any choice among the
 candidates. The Congress is made up of delegates from the
 party apparatus of each province, who are similarly selected by
 higher levels..
 Ostensibly the chief legislative body, the National Assembly in
 fact approves without dissent the policies set by the
 Politburo. National Assembly elections are held in Vietnam
 every 5 years, most recently in 1981. The elections that
 should have taken place in 1986 have been put off until 1987,
 however. Local elections will be held at the same time.
 People must participate in order to have their ration cards
 validated. Voters do not have a real choice. They may only
 strike out the names of candidates for whom they do not wish to
 vote from the single list which is presented to them.
 Although southerners are present in the Politburo and Central
 Committee and in some ministerial and National Assembly
 positions, the leadership's general distrust of southerners,
 including some long-time party members, is a significant factor
 in the assignment of political responsibilities. For the most
 part, Southerners who played major public roles in the National
 Liberation Front prior to 1975 have since been shunted aside by
 the party leadership.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitudes Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Vietnam is not a member of any international human rights
 organizations, nor does it play an active role in attempting to
 ameliorate the human rights situations in other countries. The
 Government does not permit the existence of private groups
 concerned with human rights.
 Foreign delegations and journalists who have been allowed to
 visit reeducation camps have been shown model camps. Former
 prisoners have described extensive preparations to beautify
 
 
</pre>
<pre>
 901
 VIETNAM
 camps prior to visits, temporary removal of most prisoners
 during the visit, and careful briefing of the remaining
 prisoners by Communist party cadre on what to tell delegation
 members.
 In its 1985 Report, Amnesty International expressed its
 continued concern about the long-term detention without trial
 of several thousand people allegedly associated with the
 Government of the former Republic of Vietnam. It was also
 concerned about other political prisoners arrested since 1975,
 many of whom were held without charge or trial. These included
 leading religious and intellectual figures arrested in 1984.
 Freedom House rated Vietnam as "not free."
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 Vietnam's population of 60,492,000 was growing at an annual
 rate of 2.5 percent in 1985.
 Ten years after the reunification of the country, Vietnam's
 economy continues to stagnate. Per capita national income had
 decreased 2 to 3 percent annually following a precipitous 20
 percent drop in 1975. The decline is ascribed to population
 growth, defense needs, capital construction expenses, and
 inadequacies in economic management.
 Economic stagnation also appears to be due to diversion of
 resources, particularly trained managers, to the maintenance of
 a large army, both in Cambodia and on the Chinese frontier.
 Another factor is Vietnam's inability to service its external
 debt, thereby severely limiting foreign investment and
 multilateral developmental assistance. Most countries capable
 of providing bilateral assistance, investment, or trade
 opportunities are unwilling to do so in the face of Vietnam's
 occupation of Cambodia. The flight of technically skilled
 people abroad and underuse of Western-trained technicians has
 also handicapped development.
 Although industrial production began to increase significantly
 in 1981 after several years of decline or almost zero growth,
 the industrial sector remains extremely weak. Increased
 emphasis on light industry has led to some increase in consumer
 goods, but per capita consumption is stagnant or even falling.
 Production incentives have ameliorated agricultural shortfalls
 to a degree. According to the Government, grain production
 reached nearly 17 million metric tons in 1983, and the
 Government claimed that it had reached grain self-sufficiency.
 Increase in grain production appears to be barely keeping pace,
 however, with the rate of population increase. Grain
 production in 1984 has been estimated at 17.8 million metric
 tons, though some observers believe it was significantly
 lower. The Government has reported that grain production in
 1985 was 18.2 million tons, well below the planned level of 19
 million. The plan figure for 1986 is 20 million tons.
 Collectivization of the fishing industry and nationalization of
 most ocean-going vessels have lowered fishermen's income
 severely. The fishing industry has'been further curtailed by
 strict government limits on the amount of fuel and water
 permitted aboard. These measures have been adopted to prevent
 refugee escapes. Depletion of the fishing fleet through loss
 of boats to transport refugees has also hurt the industry. As
 a result, produce from sea fishing declined annually from 1976
 until 1984 when the decline ended.
 
 
 902
 VIETNAM
 Inflation in the price of necessities, reported by refugees to
 be at least 50 percent in 1984, has also led to increased
 corruption and crime. Corruption continues to be a fact of
 life for all Vietnamese. The average citizen must bribe
 officials to obtain public services and official documents.
 For many families the black market sale of goods received in
 packages from relatives abroad has become an essential
 component of their income. However, government measures to
 restrict the amount of goods and money which families can
 receive from abroad as well as other official moves against
 free market activities have curtailed free trading.
 The level of health care has declined since 1975. The severe
 shortages of medical facilities and medicines have been
 aggravated by the need to divert material and people to the
 care of soldiers wounded in Cambodia. Only the most minimal
 facilities are available for the average worker. Ordinary
 peasants and workers must purchasb medical prescriptions on the
 open market, unlike party cadre who have access to free or
 government-subsidized prescriptions. Those who are not
 employed by the State are not eligible for care at government
 medical facilities. Medicine is in extremely short supply and
 thus expensive on the free market. Government officials have
 acknowledged that a major source of medicine for the country is
 gift packages sent to their relatives by ethnic Vietnamese
 abroad. The general health condition of people leaving through
 the Orderly Departure Program has deteriorated noticeably and
 steadily over the past 3 years, according to the doctors who
 examine them. In 1985 life expectancy was 65.1 years, and the
 infant mortality rate was 59 per 1,000 live births.
 The adult literacy rate in 1979 was 84 percent. The
 authorities claim that primary education is universal.
 Education above the elementary level, particularly at higher
 levels, is often restricted to those with approved
 backgrounds. The party committee in each school reportedly
 makes the final determination of who will graduate. Similarly,
 study abroad is restricted to politically acceptable people.
 Wages and hours of work are regulated by the Government, and
 wages are at near subsistence levels for most workers. Wage
 increases for civil servants have not kept pace with inflation,
 forcing many city dwellers, especially government cadre and
 workers, to hold two jobs. It is not known whether child labor
 or occupational safety and health laws exist in Vietnam.
 At least 55,000 Vietnamese workers have been sent under
 contract to work in various occupations.in the Soviet Union and
 other East European countries. A significant portion of their
 wages is deducted to help pay for Vietnam's debt to these
 countries. It appears that even with these deductions,
 however, workers are eager to participate in this program so as
 to escape the extreme poverty and unemployment of present-day
 Vietnam.
 Despite the promises of the Communist Party to emancipate women
 and the important administrative and productive roles filled by
 women in the war to take over the South, women in Vietnam today
 do not have positions in the-leadership of the country which
 their numbers would warrant. There are no women in the
 Politburo and only four women in the 116-member Central
 Committee. There is only one woman member, the Education
 Minister, in the Council of Ministers. Vietnamese women have
 retreated from management positions they held during the war.
 
 
 903
 VIETNAM
 This trend is partly due to the proclivities of those involved,
 but it is also a result of the attitudes of Vietnamese men.
 Moreover, women in Vietnam are limited to traditional
 occupational fields. At the primary level, women attend school
 at almost the same rate as men (89 percent versus 94 percent).
 Reliable figures are unavailable for higher education
 attendance ratios, but the disparity between rates of
 attendance for men and women is believed to be much greater.
 Gradual assimilation and appear to be the Government's long-run
 strategy for most minorities. The Government has created
 special schools in the Hanoi area to train minority cadres
 destined to be the "eyes and ears" of the party among their own
 people. Highland minorities in central Vietnam are subject to
 repression if suspected of ties with resistance groups.
 Officially sponsored settlement of ethnic Vietnamese into the
 highlands is designed to enhance lowlander control and to
 restrict minorities, some of whom are being forced away from
 their traditional farming practices and into settled
 agriculture. Southern minorities such as the Chinese, Indian,
 and Khmer have been encouraged to leave the country. One
 effect of Vietnam's history has been on the Vietnamese attitude
 toward the ethnic Chinese minority, whom the Government
 perceives as a potential fifth column, to be expelled if
 possible, and if not, to be watched and closely controlled.
 Ethnic Chinese are severely discriminated against through
 denial of officially sanctioned employment and educational
 opportunities.
 Former military officers of the Republic of Vietnam are
 systematically denied employment. The children of former
 military and civilian officials are denied university education
 by a review of family background to culls "undesirable
 elements." Men released from "reeducation camps" are formally
 denied their civil rights for an indefinite period and are
 subject to severe restrictions in employment and travel.
