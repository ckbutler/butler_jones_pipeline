 SRI LANKA
 Sri Lanka's constitutional, multiparty form of government
 features a strong executive presidency and a unicameral
 legislature elected by universal adult suffrage. President
 Ranasinghe Premadasa was elected to a 6-year term in 1988, and
 his United National Party (UNP) won a majority of the seats in
 Parliament in 1989-.
 In the 1980's, a gradually escalating conflict broke out
 between Sri Lanka's majority Sinhalese and separatist elements
 among the minority Tamil population. Indian troops sent as a
 peacekeeping force fought the separatist Liberation Tigers of
 Tamil Eelam (LTTE) during 1987-1990. During the same period,
 the Maoist Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) insurgency
 threatened the south but was defeated by early 1990. The LTTE
 entered negotiations with the Government in April 1989.
 However, in June 1990 the LTTE broke off negotiations, attacked
 and murdered hundreds of police, and renewed its war against.
 the Government. This conflict continued throughout 1991.
 The violence associated with the LTTE insurgency in 1991 was
 confined largely to military and guerrilla operations in the
 north and east, although two LTTE bombings in Colombo left the
 State Defense Minister and scores of civilians dead. While
 there were sporadic reports of arrests, disappearances, and
 killings of JVP suspects, JVP.terrorism ended and life was
 largely peaceful in the south.
 The primary internal security force is the 25,000-person police
 force, which includes 2,000 police commandos in the Special
 Task .Force (STF). The paramilitary Home Guards, charged with
 providing security against LTTE attacks for Muslim and
 Sinhalese communities in the northeast, number about
 8,000-10,000. Except for Muslim Home Guard contingents,
 security force personnel are overwhelmingly Sinhalese. The Sri
 Lankan army has carried the brunt of the fighting with the
 LTTE. The continuing need for larger forces to prosecute the
 northeast war and severe budgetary restraints have resulted in
 substantial numbers of army troops being poorly trained and
 inadequately armed and equipped.
 Sri Lanka has a mixed economy depending heavily on exports of
 tea, textiles, and rubber. Despite a sluggish public sector
 and the fiscal drain caused by large military outlays, the
 economy grew an impressive 6 percent in 1991, due in large part
 to economic reform, which included the removal of most price
 controls and subsidies, lowering of tariffs, and shrinking of
 the government bureaucracy.
 There continued to be major human rights abuses in 1991, but
 the number of incidents was markedly reduced from 1990. For
 example, .extrajudicial and combat-related civilian deaths
 declined from 2,600 in 1990 to 710 in 1991, according to.
 government statistics, the press, and nongovernmental
 observers. There were also hundreds of disappearances, most
 credibly linked to security forces; torture and mistreatment of
 prisoners; arbitrary arrest and detention, including
 incommunicado detention; and restrictions on freedoms of
 speech, press, assembly, and association. Both government and
 insurgent elements were guilty of abuses. The Prevention of
 Terrorism Act (PTA) and Emergency Regulations (ER), both of
 which grant security forces wide powers such as preventive and
 incommunicado detention, remained in effect. Some provisions
 were suspended temporarily outside the northeast, however, to
 permit unhindered elections.

 SRI LANKA
 The Government established one commission to investigate
 disappearances occurring after January 11, 1991, and another to.
 register and monitor detainees. The work of the first
 commission, however, has procedded very slowly, and neither's-
 mandate includes pursuit of prosecutions. Despite widescale
 human rights abuses in recent years, the Government has
 indicted a limited number of offenders, and only a few cases
 had been concluded by the end of 1991.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section I Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 Political killing by the Government's security forces, the LTTE
 and other militant groups, and vigilantes continued on a
 reduced but still large scale. According to government
 statistics, the press, and nongovernmental observers, there
 were roughly 710 noncombatant deaths caused by both government
 and antigovernment forces in 1991, compared to 2,600 for 1990.
 Of the 710, more than 650 occurred in the war-torn northeast
 and bordering areas. More than 90 of the deaths in the
 northeast were attributable to deliberate attacks by government
 forces, most in retaliation for LTTE attacks, and 182 to
 deliberate attacks by the LTTE, usually on Sinhalese and Muslim
 villagers. Roughly 380 of the fatalities in the northeast were
 apparently accidental deaths due to military action. In the
 south (i.e., all of the country except for the northeast
 province and bordering areas also affected by the separatist
 war), an estimated 55 civilians were killed in political
 violence. Two LTTE car bombings in Colombo accounted for 37 of
 these civilian deaths (as well as 17 deaths of security force
 personnel). The two bombings were directed against military
 targets (the State Defense Minister and the military's
 headquarters) and were carried out in busy residential and
 commercial areas of the city. In the south there were also at
 least three instances of vigilante-style killings,
 characterized by mutilated or burned bodies left in public
 areas. Six burned and bullet-ridden bodies were found in May
 and another in September. These bodies were not identified,
 and responsibility was not established. In a third incident,
 three JVP suspects released from an army camp in October were
 taken from their homes a week later, and their burnt bodies
 were found the next day. A police officer arrested in the case
 was subsequently reinstated in his job. The investigation is
 continuing, according to police officials.
 In the past, when such killings were far more common, strong
 circumstantial evidence and the opinion of a wide range of
 observers, including some members of the security forces
 themselves, linked individual security force members to some
 vigilante groups. It is likely that vigilantes operated with
 the knowledge and acquiescence of government officials. In
 1991 government sources claim these extrajudicial killings in
 the south were frequently due to the private settling of
 scores, especially against JVP members and supporters, rather
 than continued officially condoned vigilante group actions.
 Charges have been brought against security force members in at
 least two vigilante cases, and legal proceedings initiated in
 eight other human rights-related murder cases. These cases
 date from 1988 to 1991. Only one of the cases had been
 resolved by the end of 1991 (see Section l.c.), owing partly to
 killings and intimidation of witness6s and partly to a large
 
 
 1591
 SRI LANKA
 backlog in the judicial system and the fact that such cases are
 not given special priority. Those responsible for killing and
 intimidating witnesses in such cases are almost never brought
 to justice.
 There were no new developments during 1991 in the murder case
 of human rights activist Richard de Zoysa. In August 1990, the
 Attorney General cited insufficient evidence to indict the
 police officers implicated in the case; there is no evidence of
 vigorous investigation since then. In February an opposition
 parliamentary motion to create an independent commission to
 investigate the de Zoysa case was defeated. In August a JVP
 suspect leading police to an arms cache in the south reportedly
 escaped from a police vehicle and his body was later found
 under a bridge. There were no arrests in the case. Four
 policemen who allegedly beat to death a suspect in custody in
 June were charged with murder and remained in custody at year's
 end.
 In the east, there were at least two vigilante-style killings
 of civilians in April. In one incident, the headless body was
 left in a public area with a poster claiming that the "Black
 Cobras" had killed the person for helping the LTTE. The
 preponderance of evidence indicates that security force
 personnel, or people closely allied with the security forces
 and probably working with their knowledge, were responsible.
 Credible sources claim that Muslim Home Guards were responsible
 for some killings of civilians in 1991, such as the attack on a
 bus in the east in which six were killed in February. Other
 observers claim that a Muslim mob, seeking revenge for an LTTE
 attack on Muslims, was responsible. A limited number of deaths
 in the northeast in 1991 were attributable to similar violence
 between ethnic groups, often sparked by LTTE attacks on
 civilians. See Section l.g. for a discussion of deaths
 resulting from internal conflict.
 b. Disappearance
 Disappearances of both Tamils and Sinhalese, usually young men,
 continued in 1991 on a very large scale, though reduced from
 levels over the past 5 years, during which time it is estimated
 that as many as 10,000 persons disappeared. Although exact
 numbers are not known, knowledgeable sources estimate that 114
 persons disappeared in the south (18 in the last 5 months) and
 approximately 785 in the northeast (90 in the last 5 months),
 although one knowledgeable source believes there may have been
 as many as 1,000 disappearances in one of three eastern
 districts alone. Disappearances in the south were attributed
 to security forces, vigilantes who may be tied to security
 forces, and insurgent elements, but the degree of
 responsibility for each group was not clear. In the northeast,
 government forces were judged responsible for the majority of
 785 disappearances in 1991. An additional 300 persons believed
 captured by the LTTE in 1991 also remained unaccounted for.
 There were reports of the LTTE abducting persons in the
 northeast and holding them for ransom. In a few cases,
 families have testified that JVP detainees known to have been
 released never returned home, presumably because they were
 killed by unknown-persons or forces after their release.
 In the east, there was a notable improvement in the ability of
 humanitarian organizations to visit detainees. ByDecember,
 the army had begun to implement in some cases the Amnesty
 International recommendation for rapid notification of family
 members when arrests are made, according to nongovernmental
 
 
 1592
 SRI LANKA
 organization (NGO) sources. In the north, guidelines
 established between NGO'S and the military have almost
 eliminated disappearances of detainees from camps for displaced
 persons there.
 As of October, Sri Lankan attorneys had brought 20 lawsuits
 (far fewer than in 1990), asking the Government to produce
 missing persons. Government authorities are required to
 respond within days to such suits in normal circumstances, but
 the Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA) permits a 12-month
 delay. The Government continues to claim that false names
 given to conceal identity and the possible departure from the
 country of many detainees complicate the process of accounting
 for disappeared persons.
 In January the President appointed a commission to inquire into
 allegations of abductions and disappearances occurring after
 January 11, 1991, the identity of those responsible, and the
 whereabouts of the missing people. The commission was also
 empowered to report on legal measures to be taken against
 perpetrators and to assess current law relating to the problem
 and remedial measures necessary to deter future incidents.
 According to government sources, as of October the commission
 had 195 cases before it, and in the course of its work had
 located 26 persons whom family members had reported missing.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Although the Constitution forbids torture and cruel, inhuman,
 or degrading treatment or punishment, the Emergency Regulations
 allow the use in court of confessions made to police officers
 and place the burden of proof on defendants to show that a
 confession was extracted under duress. Beatings are routinely
 given during interrogations throughout the country, and
 especially brutal beatings, in which bones were broken, were
 reported in police stations in the south and east. Some
 government security officials acknowledge that security forces
 have used torture to elicit information and cooperation from
 suspected members of the JVP and LTTE. Victims and family
 members have also alleged torture by Tamil militant groups.
 In March three police officers were acquitted of murder charges
 in the 1988 death while in police custody of a lawyer and
 accused JVP activist. The court found reasonable doubt because
 others may have had access to the lawyer, who was beaten to
 death. The policemen pled guilty to wrongful detention charges
 and were ordered to pay the family compensation and were given
 suspended sentences of up to 2 years' imprisonment. Two of the
 policemen (the third has died) remained on paid suspension from
 their posts and were appealing for reinstatement.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 By law an arrested person must be informed of the reason for
 his arrest and brought within 24 hours before a magistrate who
 may authorize bail or, for serious crimes, order continued
 detention. Detainees are generally brought before a magistrate
 within a few days of arrest, but there continue to be reports
 of detainees who are never informed of the reason for their
 arrest. A suspect may also be detained up to 3 months without
 bail or longer if a court so rules.
 The PTA, adopted in 1979, and the ER, renewed monthly with the
 extension of the state of emergency in effect since 1983, are
 
 
 1593
 SRI LANKA
 exceptions to the above rules, and both permit preventive and
 incommunicado detention. A person held under the PTA may be
 detained without charge for up to 18 months. There have been
 cases in which persons have been held longer. Under the ER,
 security forces may detain a suspect for up to 3 months before
 he must be presented to a magistrate. Magistrates are not
 empowered to investigate the circumstances leading to a
 person's arrest and continued detention but must remand him to
 a prison where he may be held indefinitely. Bail may be
 granted for persons held under the ER but, once charged, PTA
 detainees are ineligible for bail. Visits by family, access to
 lawyers, food, and other conditions of incarceration are
 normally restricted under these laws. The High Courts may
 order that any detainee be produced in court at any time.
 Individuals, including ER and PTA detainees, may challenge the
 legality of their detention either by filing habeas corpus
 petitions in the Courts of Appeal or by charging the Government
 before the Supreme Court with violating fundamental
 constitutional rights. Forty-one ER and PTA detainees were
 released in 1991 through fundamental rights and habeas corpus
 petitions. Fundamental rights suits must be filed--complete
 with documentation--within 30 days of the alleged
 infringement. The 30-day limit makes it virtually impossible
 for persons detained incommunicado for prolonged periods, or
 relatives of those alleged to have disappeared, to bring such
 suits. By the end of 1990, the Government had provided the
 names of several thousand detainees to members of Parliament.
 In August a commission established to register detainees held
 under the ER and PTA and monitor their welfare began
 operation. By mid-October, the commission had visited 15 of
 the 18 army detention camps and rehabilitation camps and
 registered about 2,000 detainees. The International Committee
 of the Red Cross (ICRC) regularly visited over 600 places of
 detention, primarily in the south, where most of the detention
 sites are located (see also Section 4).
 A three-person advisory board, first established in 1988,
 reviews PTA and ER cases and makes nonbinding recommendations
 for handling them. The estimated population of 15,000 ER and
 PTA detainees in the south in February had shrunk to roughly
 5,000-7,000 detainees by October, including about 2,000 in
 rehabilitation centers. Of those still in detention camps,
 roughly 2,000-2,500 have criminal charges filed against them,
 according to government sources.
 In the east, LTTE attacks on security forces were often
 followed by roundups and screening of groups of up to several
 hundred people, mostly young males, from the nearby civilian
 population. In 1991 most of the several thousand rounded up in
 various incidents during the year were quickly released,
 according to knowledgeable sources. However, some from each
 group reportedly remained in detention, and a few disappeared.
 A credible source estimated in September that there were
 350-400 detainees held by the security forces in the east;
 there were also reported to be a lesser number in the north.
 There were reports that the LTTE is holding as many as 4,000
 political opponents on the northern peninsula, but these
 reports could not be verified (see also Section 1.g.).
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Substantial due process rights are accorded in nonpolitical
 cases, but trials under the PTA and ER lack several significant
 procedural safeguards. Persons accused of criminal acts
 
 
 1594
 SRI LANKA
 generally receive a fair public trial, are informed of the
 charges and the evidence against them, and are represented by
 counsel of their choice. Persons tried on criminal charges in
 the High Court and the Court of'Appeals are provided an
 attorney at government expense if necessary. The Government
 does not provide attorneys in other cases, though private legal
 aid organizations assist some defendants. Public trial by jury
 is the custom.
 Juries are not provided in trials under the PTA on the grounds
 that jury members could be intimidated, Confessions are
 admissible in PTA and ER cases but not in cases tried outside
 the PTA and ER framework. Most ER and PTA convictions rely
 heavily on confessions, and the burden of proof of charges of
 coercion rests on the defendant. Those convicted under the PTA
 or the ER have the same right of appeal to the Courts of Appeal
 and Supreme Court as those sentenced in other cases. In
 practice, however, most people held under these acts are never
 formally charged and therefore do not enter the appeals process.
 The Constitution provides for an independent judiciary. The
 President appoints all judges of the Supreme Court, Courts of
 Appeal, and High Courts. The Chief Justice and two Supreme
 Court judges comprise a Judicial Service Commission which
 appoints, transfers, and dismisses lower court judges. Judges
 serve from time of appointment to mandatory retirement age (65
 for Supreme Court judges and 62 for others). Because of
 hostilities in the northeast, the judiciary functioned only in
 a few larger towns in the east and one town in the north.
 It is not possible to determine how many of the approximately
 6,500 detainees the Government acknowledges holding might be
 termed political prisoners. By October, the Government had
 brought indictments against 630 persons under the PTA and 121
 under the ER.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Government generally respects individual privacy and the
 sanctity of the family and the home, and the judiciary usually
 upholds privacy rights in cases that reach the High Courts.
 Search and arrest warrants are normally required to enter
 private premises, but the PTA permits certain police officers
 to enter and search any premises without a warrant and seize
 "any document or thing" when there is a presumption or evidence
 of support for, or involvement with, unlawful activity. These
 powers were used less frequently in 1991 than in past years.
 Government monitoring of telephones and correspondence is
 believed to occur on a selective basis.
 g. Use of Excessive Force and Violations of Humanitarian
 Law in Internal Conflicts
 Hostilities between the Government and the LTTE,. which were
 resumed in 1990 after a year's truce, continued throughout 1991
 and resulted in indiscriminate killings on a wide scale. In
 contrast to earlier periods, however, the current Sri Lankan
 Government has reiterated publicly and privately that the
 northeast conflict is one against the LTTE and not the Tamil
 people, a stand generally believed to have reduced communal
 violence. During 1991 the bodies of more than 300 police
 previously captured by the LTTE in June 1990 were found. An
 additional 41 policemen are known to be held by the LTTE, and
 more than 200 are missing. More than 650 noncombatants were
 
 
 1595
 SRI LANKA
 also killed in the northeast and adjacent areas in 1991, with
 more than 90 of these deaths attributable to deliberate attacks
 by government forces and more than 182 to deliberate attacks by
 the LTTE. The balance were apparently accidental, combat-
 related deaths. The figure for noncombatant fatalities--
 one-tenth the figure for combatant fatalities--is based
 primarily on government reports and newspaper accounts and is
 probably low since many reports of incidents never reach the
 media.
 The LTTE's wide use of antipersonnel mines caused
 indiscriminate death or injury to many persons in the
 northeast. In the north, LTTE and government areas of control
 were relatively clearly delineated. By contrast, security
 forces in the east were frequently caught in LTTE ambushes,
 even in the larger towns which they nominally controlled. The
 remote-controlled mines used in many of these ambushes led to
 many deaths and injuries. During the first 9 months of 1991
 the LTTE was widely considered responsible for at least 16
 attacks on civilian targets which killed more than 182 people.
 Most of these incidents were attacks on Sinhalese and Muslim
 villages in the east and bordering areas in which men, women,
 and children were shot or hacked to death. In March the LTTE
 placed a bomb in a Muslim marketplace, killing eight. A June
 nighttime attack on a bus killed 23, including a Danish
 national.
 There were several instances in which the security forces
 avenged LTTE attacks by retaliating against nearby Tamil
 civilians. In June soldiers responded to the death of two of
 their colleagues in an LTTE bombing by going on a rampage in
 two villages near Kokkaddicholai, killing at least 67 and
 perhaps more than 100. At year's end, the commission
 immediately appointed to investigate the incident was still
 hearing the testimony of witnesses, and no findings have been
 published. The lieutenant and 16 soldiers of the detachment
 involved in the murders were confined to their base, but no
 criminal charges had yet been brought.
 Credible sources reported several other incidents of security
 force retaliation, one in February in which 4 Tamils were
 killed in the north, one in the east in March in which 11
 people were killed, and one in the east in June in which 8
 Tamil civilians were killed. There also were at least six
 credible reports in 1991 of abuses committed by the military
 forces, including extrajudicial killings and looting.
 Many Tamils in the northern peninsula, dominated by the LTTE
 since June 1990, reported incidents of apparently
 indiscriminate aerial bombing or strafing of civilian areas
 until March 1991. As many as 100 people, thought to be mostly
 civilians, are estimated to have been killed in aerial attacks
 in the first 3 months of 1991. After March, according to
 residents of the northern peninsula, aerial attacks were far
 fewer and some were targeted against those traveling during
 curfews and against sites where intelligence indicated that a
 LTTE leader would be present at a ceremony. The Air Force
 continued in 1991 to drop leaflets warning civilians of pending
 operations. There were also reports of untargeted shelling in
 the northern peninsula after the June car-bombing of military
 headquarters in Colombo (see Section l.a.) and the launch of a
 major LTTE offensive against an army camp in July.
 
 
 1596
 SRI LAKA
 Several thousand Tamils were rounded up in the east in
 cordon-and-search operations in 1991. Most were quickly
 released, but some were held. in detention. Large numbers
 (perhaps several thousand) of Tamil youths rounded up during
 similar operations in 1990 have failed to return to their
 homes.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution provides for freedom of speech and expression
 but permits these rights to be restricted by law in the
 interest of national security. The ER has been used directly
 and indirectly to restrict free speech. For example, persons
 wishing to post bills advertising meetings of any type are
 required under the ER to secure police approval of the text,
 although, pursuant to a Supreme Court ruling in 1987, the
 police must specify a reason for denying permission. There
 were no prosecutions for distribution of "antigovernment"
 literature in 1991. However, the Government considers
 possession of JVP literature prima facie evidence of
 involvement in the organization and reason for detention under
 the ER. Under the amended 1978 Parliamentary Powers and
 Privileges Act, Parliament may impose an unlimited fine or up
 to 2 years' imprisonment on anyone who criticizes a member of
 Parliament, a clear deterrent to freedom of expression. The
 amendment was not applied in 1991.
 The Government controls the country's'largest newspaper chain.
 A variety of independent newspapers and journals provide a
 range of viewpoints on foreign affairs and most domestic
 issues, including human rights. Many newspapers openly
 criticize the ruling party and the Government. Many
 small-circulation periodicals are also published by opposition
 political parties and special interest groups. They have
 claimed that various groups have required them to publish
 articles the groups have provided, threatening them if their
 demands were not met. Tamil-language newspapers in particular
 have claimed that militant Tamil groups have required them to
 publish articles the groups have provided. The media based in
 the northern peninsula have been subjected to particularly
 tight control by the LTTE.
 There was no formal political censorship in 1991, but
 journalists assert that government pressure--or the threat of
 pressure--forces the press to exercise self-censorship.
 Although the Government denies it, it is widely alleged that
 the Government exerts pressure on the press by controlling
 permits for the import of newsprint and through placement of
 paid government announcements and advertising. In October
 several state-owned and state-affiliated banks were directed to
 check for any loans in arrears that an opposition newspaper
 might have, suggesting that such loans be called in, according
 to credible sources. The Government also sealed the printing
 press of an independent weekly without giving legal grounds. A
 fundamental rights suit filed with the Supreme Court on this
 action was still pending at year's end. In 1990 the Government
 announced that it would enforce the Press Council Law, which
 prohibits unauthorized publication of cabinet discussions and
 decisions. No charges have been brought under the law, but
 fear of its sanctions further encourages self-censorship.
 However, during an impeachment challenge that began in August,
 there were no known cases of censorship of the print media
 beyond the sealing of the printing press mentioned above, and
 
 
 1597
 
 SRI LANKA
 the press generally seemed emboldened. English and
 Sinhala-language newspaper editors say they are now more
 subject to business pressures than physical threats.
 The Government owns the radio and television networks, and only
 news approved by the Government may be broadcast on
 television. For example, during the impeachment crisis the
 resignation of dissident parliamentarians was not reported on
 radio or television. Although academic freedom is generally
 respected, a new ER was imposed in 1990 banning political or
 disruptive activities at. all schools (see Section 2.b.). The
 Government has justified this action as necessary to ensure
 that student political activity, such as that used earlier by
 the J-P to close down the universities for 3 years, would not
 force a new school closure.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Constitution provides for freedom of assembly and
 association, but these rights are restricted under provisions
 of the ER and PTA.
 As a general practice, the police issue or deny permits for
 outdoor meetings or processions at the discretion of the
 superintendent of police in each locality. Dur'ing the Persian
 Gulf War, the Government disapproved pro-Iraq demonstration
 marches, although it allowed several small rallies to take
 place. The opposition was allowed to hold a series of large
 demonstrations during their impeachment bid against the
 President (see Section 3), although municipal authorities
 sometimes denied the use of sites in town centers. The
 Government retained in effect the 1988 order to its security
 forces to shoot on sight illegal antigovernment demonstrators
 but did not use it in 1991.
 An ER issued in 1990 prohibiting political and disruptive
 activity in schools and workplaces remains in effect., Under
 it, permission for meetings must be obtained from the head'of
 an institution.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 The Constitution establishes Buddhism as the official religion,
 which the Government must "protect and foster." It' also
 provides for the rights of members of other faiths, including
 Hindus, Muslims, axnd Christians, to practice their religio
 freely.
 Religious groups are free to maintain active ties with
 coreligionists in other countries, and many Sri Lankans perform
 religious travel each year. Religious publishing and
 proselytizing are allowed, and foreign clergy may work in "Sri
 Lanka. For over 30 years, however, the Government has
 forbidden the entry of new foreign Jesuit clergy, while
 allowing those already in the country to remain.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 The Constitution grants every citizen "freedom of movement and
 of choosing his residence within Sri Lanka" and "freedom to
 return to Sri Lanka." These provisions are generally honored.
 However, curfews, checkpoints, and other actions taken by both
 the Government and insurgent forces have had the effect of
 inhibiting free travel in certain areas.
 
 
 1598
 SRI LANKA
 Sri Lanka generally denies entry to refugees or displaced
 persons from other countries. The Government does not help
 refugees who attempt to stay in the country while seeking
 permanent residence elsewhere. 'There were over 674,000
 internally displaced persons in Sri Lanka in June. Most lived
 in camps, primarily financed by the Government, in the
 northeast or adjacent provinces. The United Nations High
 Commissioner for Refugees operated in Sri Lanka, supporting
 government refugee efforts in noncombat zones. Over 135,000
 Sri Lankan Tamil refugees left for southern India between June
 1990 and September 1991; the majority left in 1990. In
 addition, as many as 70,000 Sri Lankan Tamils have sought
 refuge in Western Europe and North America over the last few
 years. Tens of thousands of Sri Lankan workers, most of them
 females, returned to Sri Lanka from the Persian Gulf area
 before and during the Gulf War.
 The Government does not restrict the travel abroad of its
 citizens but does restrict the amount of foreign exchange they
 may take with them.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Citizens have the constitutional right to change their
 government through periodic multiparty elections on the basis
 of universal adult suffrage.
 An international observer team judged the May 11 local
 government elections held outside the northeast largely free
 and fair. The ruling party won 52 percent of the popular vote
 and gained control of 81 percent of the local bodies. The
 election of members of the northeast provincial council
 continued to be deferred because of fighting in the area. A
 September impeachment bid against the President was
 unsuccessful.
 A total of 29 political parties are legally recognized; 10 hold
 seats in the Parliament.
 Although members of each ethnic community can be found in many
 of the political parties, the most influential political
 parties generally draw their support from one ethnic
 community. Historically, the two parties dominant in the
 majority Sinhalese electorate have alternated rule. In 1988
 and 1989, several formerly militant Tamil groups that had
 accepted the Indo-Sri Lanka Accord emerged as political parties
 in the northeast, representing the Ceylon Tamil population.
 Tamil parties won 23 seats in the Parliament.
 There are no de jure impediments to women's participation in
 politics and government. Although underrepresented, there are
 women at senior levels in both these sectors, including a
 cabinet minister and the leader of the principal opposition
 party, who was formerly Prime Minister.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Several local nongovernmental organizations, including the
 Civil Rights Movement and the Movement for Interracial Justice
 and Equality, monitor human rights, collecting information from
 families of victims or members of citizens' committees near the
 site of alleged incidents. The Government generally does not
 
 
 199
 SRI LANKA
 address their periodic reportsand appeals. In contrast to
 recent years, there were no repbrted threats against human
 rights activists in 1991. The high-level human rights task
 force established by the President in November 1990 inquired
 into a limited number of human rights cases referred to it by
 domestic and international sources and recommended to the
 President further steps to improve the Government's human
 rights performance, including visits by Amnesty International
 (AI) and the United Nations Human Rights Commission's (UNHRC)
 Working Group on Enforced and Involuntary Disappearances.
 However, human rights activists claim that this commission-and
 two others established in 1991 to deal with problems of
 disappearances and treatment of detainees (see.Sections l.b.
 and I.d.)--are mostly cosmetic. Senior government officials
 have made themselves available to visitors looking into human
 rights issues and have responded to inquiries from the UNHRC
 and foreign governments. In June an AI research team visited
 Sri Lanka and met with a wide range of officials and human
 rights observers, and in December the Government announced it
 would adopt 28 of 32 AI recommendations. The Government
 declined, however, to broaden themandate of the Disappearances
 Commission (see Section l.b.) to include investigation of
 disappeatances before January 11, 1991. By year's end the
 UNHRC Working Group on Enforced and Involuntary Disappearances
 had not issued its report on its visit to Sri Lanka in
 October. The Government has also invited the U.N.,Special
 Rapporteuf on Summary and Arbitrary Executions to Sri Lanka.
 Government cooperation with the ICRC continued in 1991. The
 Government provided the ICRC with open access to its detention
 facilities to register detainees and to monitor their
 treatment, and it permitted the ICRC to transport government
 and donor-provided food and medicine into the war-zone, even
 though some inevitably fills into LTTE hands. The LTTE also
 provided the ICRC with periodic access to limited numbers of
 its government police detainees during 1991. In addition, the
 ICRC provided human rights training and materials to. the Sri
 Lankan'military and police.
 A .ariety of international nongovernmental organizations
 (NGO's) are active in Sri Lanka, providing .humanitarian relief
 services to those affected by the conflict in the-northeast.
 Some report that they have established good relations with the
 Sri Lankan military. For example,-the military and-the NGO's
 established guidelines for such operations as-the making of
 arrests in refugee camps administered by the NGO's. Some NGO's
 are negotiating with the Government new guidelines for
 safeguarding the movement of their vehicles in the northeast.
 The effort was prompted by an incident in May in which the Sri
 Lankan air force strafed and bombed a vehicle-of the French NGO
 Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF), injuring the three expatriate
 passengers and the Sri Lankan driver.
 In December 1990 the Government established a commission to
 look into means for more closely regulating the more than 3,000
 registered foreign and domestic NGO's working in the country.
 It required NGO's to provide detailed information on their
 funding and activities. NGO workers and human rights advocates
 have expressed concern that the commissidn is trying to
 discredit NGO's as the agents of foreign powers and may
 ultimately restrict their freedom, a charge denied by the
 Government.

 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Although Tamils have long believed, with some justification,
 that they suffer systematic discrimination in competition for
 university entrance, employment opportunities, and other
 matters under government control, there has been no evidence of
 systematic or official discrimination in university enrollment
 or government employment for the past 2 years. In March 1990,
 the Government decreed that hiring and promotions for the
 public service would be based on ethnic proportions in
 society. Upholding a suit filed by a Tamil public servant, the
 Supreme Court ruled in January 1991 that promotions must be
 based on merit but did not address the hiring issue. Under tbe
 Constitution's 13th amendment, enacted in November 1987 to
 implement the terms of the Indo-Sri Lanka accord, Tamil and
 Sinhala were both made official languages and English the
 "link" language. However, it is estimated that 98 percent of
 all schools are still segregated by language. In July all
 parties represented in the Parliament agreed to establish a
 select committee to examine Sri Lanka's ethnic problem. At
 year's,end the committee was meeting but had not yet made any
 recommendations,.
 Stateless Tamils living in Sri Lanka's tea-growing highlands
 (so-called Indian Tamils) have suffered particular
 discrimination, especially in the allocation of education
 funds. No longer qualifying for citizenship under Indian law,
 they were also denied Sri Lankan citizenship by laws adopted
 after independence. Since then, the Sri Lankan and Indian
 governments have reached several agreements aimed at resolving
 the problem. Under a 1986 agreement, the Sri Lankan Government
 agreed to grant citizenship to all remaining stateless Tamils.
 In November 1988, the Government eliminated processing delays
 by passing a law making extension of citizenship to these
 stateless persons automatic upon a simple request. The new
 legislation did not cover, however, some 168,000 Tamils who
 themselves or whose parents once applied for Indian citizenship
 but who now wish to stay in Sri Lanka. While these Tamils
 could be compelled legally to leave Sri Lanka, none has been
 forced to do so. The Government stated that earlier plans for
 the recruitment of Tamils into the military and the
 establishment of a predominantly Tamil police force for the
 northeast were not implemented because of renewed hostilities
 in 1990 and a lack of suitable candidates.
 Sri Lankan women have equal rights under the law, including
 equal property and inheritance rights. However, various ethnic
 and religious groups have their own customs which place
 limitations on women. Some Muslim women are discouraged by
 members of their community from seeking higher education or
 employment. Women do fill important posts in the civil
 service, the professions, and business, but most are found
 either in manual and semiskilled jobs or in the home. The
 Government sets pay rates for most agricultural and
 nonagricultural work, and according to Ministry of Labor
 statistics, women are paid equally for similar work.
 Violence against women occurs in Sri Lanka, but little is known
 about its extent. There are no official statistics on the
 subject. Abuse within the family is seldom reported or
 discussed publicly owing to a strong sense of familial
 privacy. Perpetrators of violence against women may be
 prosecuted under the criminal code, but many women are
 reluctant to pursue charges against family members. There are
 
 
</pre>
<pre>
 1601
 SRI LANKA
 infrequent reports of rape, wife beating, and murder of wives
 by husbands. Several women's advocacy groups are active in
 documenting and treating cases of violence against women.
 The Government established a commission for the elimination of
 discrimination and the monitoring of fundamental rights late in
 1986. Charged with investigating individual complaints of
 discrimination in public sector employment on the basis of
 race, religion, language, caste, sex, political opinion, or
 place of birth, the commission resolved over 275 complaints in
 1991.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 The Constitution provides for the right to form and join trade
 unions. Any seven workers may form a union, draw up their own
 charter, elect their own representatives, and formulate
 programs. Worker rights, including the right to choose
 representatives, publicize views, and determine programs, are
 protected by law. Unions are free to affiliate.
 internationally, and different Sri Lankan trade union
 federations are affiliates of all three major international
 trade union organizations.
 Public servants have no right to strike and are not provided
 arbitration machinery. Aggrieved public servants may appeal.to
 the Public Service Commission for relief. However, union
 activists and labor lawyers claim that the Commission is biased
 against employees. Other workers are free to strike; there,
 were about 20 strikes in 1991 in all sectors, including about a
 dozen small, isolated strikes in the plantation sector, mostly
 over administrative matters that were subsequently settled.
 Strikes in key industries require 21 days' notice and are
 subject t6 other limitations. Under the-Essential Services Act
 (ESA), the President may declare any business to be an
 essential service, making a strike illegal. In February the
 ESA was used by a private firm to justify the firing of
 striking textile workers. (Certain industries, including
 textiles, were declared essential in a presidential decree.)
 Despite intercessions by the Commissioner of Labor, they had
 not been rehired as of year's end. Union leaders complain that
 the ESA is abused.
 About 1,000 labor unions and federations (there are no dominant
 trade union centers) represent about one-third of the
 5.5-million-strong labor force. Although there are a few
 independent unions, most large worker-organizations are
 affiliated with political parties and play a significant role
 in the political process. Two unions are affiliated with, but
 are not directly controlled by, the governing UNP.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 Workers are expressly granted the right under the law to
 bargain collectively by formation of workers' councils to
 promote a voluntary worker-employer dialogue. Collective
 bargaining takes place especially in state banks and the
 private sector, where it occurs in an estimated 15-20 percent
 of businesses. For more than 100 occupations in industry,
 commerce, services, and agriculture, minimum wages are set by
 37 wage boards. Employees, employers, and department of labor
 representatives sit on the boards; Remuneration tribunals also
 set minimum wages in some cases. Antiunion discrimination is
 
 
 1602
 SRI LANKA
 prohibited by law, and workers who believe that they have
 suffered discrimination as a result of their union affiliation
 or who believe that the right to bargain collectively has been
 abridged may lodge complaints with the Commissioner of Labor,
 the Labor Tribunal, or the Supreme Court. Department of Labor
 officers, who are stationed throughout the country, may
 arbitrate when workers and employers are not able to resolve a
 dispute.
 Workers in the nonplantation agricultural sector and most of
 those employed in small businesses, as well as workers in the
 free trade zones, are not represented by unions. Unionization
 in the zones is not prohibited by law but is discouraged in
 practice by employers and the Government. Union organizers,
 like all other individuals who lack work passes, do not have
 access to workers inside the zones, ostensibly for security
 reasons. Zone employees participate in the labor-management
 associations within companies. Workers in the zones have the
 same legal right to strike; in 1991 there were a minimum of
 eight work stoppages in the zones.
 Workers in the unorganized agricultural sector are not covered
 by labor laws, although the Government may investigate
 individual complaints.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 While not prohibited by law, forced labor is not practiced by
 the Government or the private sector. The LTTE began in
 September 1990 forcibly conscripting labor for digging
 trenches, building bunkers, and ferrying supplies.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 Employment of children under age 14 is prohibited by law except
 that younger children are allowed to work an hour daily before
 and after school on family farms. Employment of young persons
 between 14 and 18 is subject to certain restrictions. In
 addition, employers are required to provide young workers with
 annual leave, rest periods, and meal breaks similar to those
 provided to adult workers. There is no compulsory education
 law.
 The regulations prohibiting child labor are not effectively
 enforced. According to a 1991 government report, 500,000
 youths and children are employed in contravention of these
 regulations. The report also stated that 20,000 youths under
 the age of 18 years were engaged in prostitution (in Sri Lanka
 this means mostly males), and another 10,000 are begging on the
 streets. Other sources indicate that there are probably tens
 of thousands of children who work illegally on farms or as
 domestics or in other menial jobs. Public awareness of this
 problem is increasing, but efforts to redress it have been
 hampered by the fact that in many cases child workers are an
 important source of family income.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 There is no national minimum wage, but wage boards for 37
 different trades set minimum wages and working conditions. The
 minimum wage is considered insufficient for a worker to
 maintain a decent standard of living for the standard family of
 five. The minimum wage law is effectively enforced by the
 Labor Department and the courts.
 
 
 1603
 SRI LANKA
 Most permanent full-time workers are covered by laws that
 prohibit them from working more than 45 hours per week and
 require that they receive a 14-day paid annual holiday.
 Minimum conditions for the protection of the safety and health
 of workers are set forth in laws administered by the Department
 of Labor, which employs a small staff of engineers and
 inspectors for this purpose. Fines of up to $150 may be levied
 on employers who fail to meet the prescribed standards. The
 Department of Labor educates workers about minimum standards
 for different workplaces and encourages the use of safety
 equipment such as earplugs, helmets, and machine guards.
 Government enforcement of health and safety standards is poor.
