 UNITED ARAB EMIRATES
 The United Arab Emirates (UAE) is a federation of seven
 autonomous emirates, each of which retains extensive powers in
 such vital issues as economic policy (including petroleum),
 internal security, and defense. The emirate rulers' legitimacy
 is based on longstanding traditions of tribal leadership.
 There are no elections. The rulers comprise a Supreme Council
 which, in theory, is the highest legislative and executive body
 but which seldom meets. The Supreme Council selects a
 president and vice president from its membership. The
 president appoints a prime minister and a cabinet. A Federal
 National Council of 40 members, appointed by the emirate
 rulers, offers the federal government nonbinding advice on
 legislation and reviews government operations. Representation
 on the council is roughly proportional to the population of
 each emirate.
 The economy is based almost entirely on oil production, which
 has made the UAE's per capita national income one of the
 world's highest. A small citizen population controls the
 country's economic life but depends heavily on a much larger
 contingent of foreigners to provide manual labor and vital
 technical skills. Economic recession, a consequence of the
 slack world oil market, has begun to reduce the foreign labor
 force and heightened government vigilance about immigration and
 labor regulations.
 The emirates of the United Arab Emirates maintain independent
 internal security organizations, which concentrate mainly on
 antiterrorist activity.
 There are no formal restrictions on citizens' rights to
 associate, pursue private interests, or hold private property.
 Foreigners have no political role. Women play a restricted
 public role, out of tradition rather than explicit government
 policy.
 There were no significant changes in the human rights situation
 in 1986. In the political sphere, the ruling families and
 their allies continued to play a dominant role. There was no
 discernible movement to expand the powers of the nonelected
 Federal National Council or to extend the boundaries of formal
 political participation.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 No political killings were reported.
 b. Disappearance
 No political disappearances were reported.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 The provisional Constitution prohibits torture or degrading
 treatment of any person, and the physical or moral abuse of an
 accused person. No instances of torture were reported. Prison
 conditions, including diet and medical facilities, are
 
 
 1326
 UNITED ARAB EMIRATES
 adequate. Prisoners are permitted visits from family members,
 friends, and lawyers. Consular access to imprisoned foreign
 nationals is permitted, although it is sometimes delayed.
 There is no evidence that the authorities allow mistreatment of
 prisoners.
 There were no instances of the amputation of a hand for theft
 or stoning for adultery under the system of Shari'a law, which
 is an integral part of the judicial system.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The Provisional Constitution prohibits arrest, search,
 detention, or imprisonment except in accordance with the law,
 and the laws of each emirate prohibit arrest or search without
 probable cause. Prolonged detention without charge is rare,
 although instances have been reported, especially in national
 security cases. By law, the police must report any arrest to a
 judge within 48 hours for his determination whether to charge,
 release, or, with sufficient police justification, allow
 limited further detention during a continuing investigation.
 Once charged, suspects come to trial expeditiously. In 1986
 there were no reported instances of preventive detention.
 Forced labor is not practiced. The Provisional Constitution
 prohibits the exile of citizens.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The UAE has a dual system of Shari'a and civil courts, which
 deal with criminal and civil cases. Each court system has a
 multilevel appeal process. Either the plaintiff or the nature
 of the case determines which court system hears a particular
 case.
 Legal counsel is readily available and permitted to represent a
 defendant in both court systems. The court may appoint legal
 counsel if counsel agrees to provide services free; no system
 of state payment of public defenders exists.
 There are no jury trials. All cases, except national security
 cases and those deemed by the judge likely to upset public
 morality, are open to the public. Most judges are foreign
 nationals, primarily from other Arab countries. Rulers
 occasionally interfere in the judicial process. Nonetheless,
 the court system is generally regarded as fair and its
 judgments well considered.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Provisional Constitution prohibits entry of homes without
 permission, except in accordance with the law. Although the
 police can enter homes without a warrant and without
 demonstrating probable cause in advance, an officer is
 answerable if he abuses his authority in doing so. Anyone
 other than a police officer must have a court order to enter a
 private home. Local custom and practice give high value to
 privacy and violations are rare. Surveillance of private
 correspondence is not practiced. Except for rare instances
 involving national security, no cases of arbitrary interference
 with privacy have been reported in recent years.

 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Emirate citizens are constitutionally guaranteed freedom of
 speech. In practice, however, most inhabitants, especially
 foreign nationals, are circumspect in public discussions of
 sensitive political topics.
 Although most of the local English- and Arabic-lanuage
 newspapers are privately owned, all but one receive government
 subsidies. The press operates under a law which codifies the
 powers of censorship and media closure and it adheres to
 reporting guidelines.
 These regulations, along with self-censorship by journalists,
 make actual censorship rare. Local newspapers are seldom
 critical of government policy. They are cautious in reporting
 on the ruling families, national security, and relations with
 neighboring states. Particularly on domestic issues, the
 Arabic press is generally more open than the English language
 press.
 The censorship department of the Ministry of Information and
 Culture scrutinizes all imported newspapers, periodicals,
 films, and videos, and bans items considered pornographic,
 violent, derogatory to Islam or Christianity, favorable to
 Israel, unduly critical of friendly countries, or critical of
 the ruling families.
 The Ministry of Information and Culture and some emirate
 governments own radio and television stations and assure that
 programs and news reporting are in conformity with the
 standards imposed on the other media.
 . b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Political parties are not allowed. Organized public gatherings
 require a government permit. In practice, public gatherings
 are rare. The citizen population normally confines its
 political discussion and debate to the numerous "assemblies,"
 held in private homes, which are a local tradition.
 There is no legal provision for the right of workers to
 organize, to engage in collective bargaining, or to strike.
 Foreign workers attempting to do so would almost certainly be
 deported. For the resolution of work-related disputes, workers
 have access to conciliation committees, organized by the
 Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs, and to special labor
 courts. These committees and courts are regarded as effective
 and fair.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Islam is the official religon of the UAE. Non-Muslims are free
 to practice their religion but may not publicly proselytize or
 distribute religious literature.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 There are no restrictions on freedom of movement or relocation
 within the country except for security areas such as defense
 and oil installations. Unrestricted foreign travel and
 emigration are permitted to citizens. Exit visas are not
 
 
 1328
 UNITED ARAB EMIRATES
 required. The right of return is extended to all citizens.
 There are no known instances of revocation of citizenship for
 political reasons. Foreign workers who terminate employment
 are normally required to leave the country for at least 6
 months before they-may return to new jobs. However, categories
 of personnel who have been exempted from this provision are
 increasing.
 The UAE and its member emirates have long accepted groups of
 displaced persons, such'as Palestinians, and those attracted by
 economic opportunity, such as Iranians. Except for those who
 were settled in the area long before the UAE's independence,
 few of these persons have become citizens. Although lacking a
 formalized procedure for accepting refugees, the UAE
 occasionally grants Iranians refuge if they can demonstrate
 that they would face persecution in Iran. However, most
 Iranians; if-intercepted attempting to enter the coutry
 illegally, are turned back.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change'Their Government.
 The UAE has no formal democratic institutions. Most of its
 citizens have little or no say in the process of government or
 in the choice of leaders. The bulk of executive and
 legislative power is in the hands of the seven emirate rulers
 and their families. In 1986, these rulers, sitting as the
 Supreme Council, unanimously reelected Shaikh Zayed Bin Sultan
 Al-Nahyan, ruler of United Arab Emirates, as President and
 Shaikh Rashid Bin Saeed Al-Maktoum, ruler of Dubai, as Vice
 President;- Intermarriage and alliances between the ruling
 families and other influential families extend the network of
 informal participation by which-most major decisions are made.
 The positions and powers of individual rulers are not defined
 constitutionally. They are the product of:traditional concepts
 of authority. Although the rulers and ruling families are
 presumed to have a right to rule, their incumbency ultimately
 depends on the quality of their leadership and responsiveness
 to their subjects' needs. Emirate rulers are accessible to any
 subject who has a problem or a request. The choice of a new
 ruler falls to the ruling family, which is supposed to choose
 its most capable and respected eligible member. In practice,
 to avoid violent succession disputes which were common in the
 past, primogeniture has become increasingly common.
 The political dominance of the ruling families is intertwined
 with their substantial involvement and influence in economic
 life. The ruling families and their close allies control and
 profit from petroleum production, and, with important merchant
 families, have a major stake in the UAE's commercial life.
 With few exceptions, the large foreign community has no
 political role.
 In 1986, there were few indications of movement toward more
 democratic institutions. The country's most representative
 institution, the Federal National Council, continued to meet
 and debate government policy, but there was no sign of change
 in its advisory status or in its nonelective method of
 selection.

 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The UAE is responsive to foreign criticism of its human rights
 situation. For example, it has improved its labor laws in
 response to criticism that low-paid foreign workers were being
 mistreated. The UAE has no internal groups which monitor human
 rights. No outside human rights group visited the UAE in 1986.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Conservative attitudes about women's roles and the frequency of
 early marriage still limit women's educational opportunities.
 However, women's education is advancing (females outscore males
 in many subjects at all levels) and opportunities for women are
 growing in government service and the news media, besides the
 more traditional fields of education and health.
 Because foreign workers can stay in the UAE only with the
 continuing approval of the Government, and would probably face
 unemployment or lower wages in their country of origin, they
 are occasionally abused or exploited by employers who take
 advantage of their relunctance to protest. The.Government has
 taken steps to improve the labor law covering conditions of
 employment, compensation, inspection of-the workplace, and
 enforcement procedures.
 In 1986 consideration was given to legislation which would
 limit the marriage of UAE citizens to foreigners. Although
 many foreigners have lived in the UAE for years and have held
 highly responsible positions, very few, even fellow Arabs, have
 been granted citizenship.
 CONDITIONS OF LABOR
 Labor regulations prohibit employment of youths below 18 and
 restrict hours of-work to 8 hours per day, 6 days per week.
 Since the children of UAE nationals have little incentive to
 work, and only adult foreign workers are allowed in the
 country, there is virtually no child labor. There is no
 minimum wage. The Government has adopted occupational safety
 standards which are generally enforced.
