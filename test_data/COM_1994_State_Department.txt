 COMOROS*
 The Federal Islamic Republic of the Comoros comprises three islands and claims
 a fourth, Mayotte, which is still governed by France. Since the assassination of
 President Abdallah in 1989, the Comoros has passed from a de facto one-party state,
 through a brief rule by European mercenaries, to a government, chosen in
 multiparty elections in 1991, won by Said Mohamed Djohar. President DJohar has
 controlled the Government since 1991 but has faced strong opposition in the Na-
 tional Assembly, particularly from the Udzima Party, formerly the sole legal party.
 He has also survived several coup attempts. In the new elections held at the end
 of 1993, Djohar's Rassemblement pour la Democratie et le Renouveau (RDR) party
 won a majority in the Assembly, and the President consolidated his position in 1994.
 The 1992 Constitution mandates several institutions, including a senate, constitu-
 tional court, and island councils, but by year's end the Government had not estab-
 lished them.
 The Comorian Defense Force (FCD) and the gendarmerie are responsible for inter-
 nal security. Both are under civilian control answering to the Presidency and the
 Ministry of Interior respectively. Security iorces committed a number of human
 rights abuses in 1994, and during the last elections there were reports of inter-
 ference by members of the military acting on behalf of the Djohar Government.
 French officers serve as advisers to the FCD.
 The economy is dominated by ariulture, but there is a shortage of arable land,
 and soil erosion has exacerbated the problem. Revenues from the main crps-va-
 nilla, essence of ylang ylang, and cloves--continue to fall, while the population
 (about 500,000) is growing at an extremely high rate. Comoros is a part of the
 French franc monetary zone, and while the 1994 devaluation of the franc may im.
 prove export and investment opportunities in the Iong term, it has had serious
 short-term consequences on the Government's finances. Comoros depends heavily on
 French financial assistance.
 The human rights situation did not improve in 1994. The Government abridged
 freedoms of the press and assembly, and security forces killed several persons in
 controlling a demonstration on the island of Mcheli. The Government continued to
 hold incommunicado an unknown number of soldiers who had allegedly participated
 in the 1992 coup attempt against the Government. The 1993 trial in the State Secu-
 rity Court of 16 other persons, including two sons of former president Abdallah, for
 participation in the 1992 coup attempt did not meet international standards of fair
 trial. The Government did permit officials of the International Committee of the Red
 Cross (ICRC) to visit Abdalah's sons in prison. Prison conditions remained harsh,
 and societal discrimination against women continued as a serious problem.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no known political
 killings, but on at least one occasion, government forces used excessive force against
 antigoverninent demonstrators on the outer island of Moheli. According to credible
 reports, in June government forces fired into the crowd, killing three persons and
 wounding several others. The demonstrators also committed acts of violence during
 the melee.
 As far as known, there was no official investigation into the deaths of two persons
 reportedly killed (and secretly buried) by the gendarmerie on the eve of the legisla-
 tive elections in December 1993 on the island of Anjouan.
 b. Disappearance.-rThere were no reported disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or islad    Treatment or Punishmnent.-
 There were no substantiated rports of torture or other cruel, inhuman, or degrad-
 ing treatment, or punishment. However, several persons, all members of opposition
 parties, who were arrested in late 1993 on the is and on *nouan, claimed that they
 rad een mistreated by the gendarmerie at Koki prison in Mutsamudu.
 Prison con ditions-especially in military prisons where most political prisoners
 are held--continued to be poor. A lack of proper sanitation, overcrowding, inad-
 equate medical facilities, and poor diet are common problems. The Government ad-
 mits these problems but has taken no action to remedy them. Those persons impris-
 oned in connection with the 1992 coup attempt reported that they were held in
 cramped cells, humid and poorly ventilated, without sanitary facilities, especially at
 *There is no U.S. Embassy in the Comoros. Information on the human rights situation is
 therefore limited.

 Kandani barracks in Moroni. While the Government would not permit diplomats to
 visit the two sons of former president Abdallah, who were implicated in the 1992
 coup attempt and are being held in Kandani prison, it did permit an ICRC official
 to visit them. There were no reports of abuse of women in prison.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution does not specify a time
 limit between arrest and appearance before a magistrate; however, according to
 usual Comorian procedure the time limit is 48 hours. The law is silent about how
 long prisoners held for security reasons may be detained without being charged. The
 soldiers arrested after the 1992 coup attempt have been held incommunicado
 throughout 1993 and 1994 without charge or trial. The exact number of soldiers
 being-held is unknown, but estimates range from 11 to 70. The Government does
 not use forced exile as a means of political control.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The 1992 Constitution provides for the equality
 of all citizens before the law and the right of all accused persons to defense counsel.
 However, there are very few lawyers in the country, making it difficult to obtain
 legal representation. The Government does not provide free legal counsel to the ac-
 cused. The Comorian legal system incorporates Islamic law as well as French legal
 codes. Most disputes are settled by village elders or by a civilian court of first in-
 stance. In reglar civil and criminal cases, the judiciary is largely independent, and
 trials are public. The Supreme Court has the power to review the decisions of lower
 courts, including the Court of Appeals.
 The number of political prisoners held by the Government was not known at
 year's end. Omar Tamou and 1Ntara Maecha, who admitted to staging the 1992
 coup, remained in prison serving life sentences. The State Security Court trial of
 16 persons (4 in absentia), including the two sons of former president Abdallah, held
 in April 1993, has been judged unfair by international human rights monitors.
 There was evidence of executive interference during the trial (see the 1993 report),
 and defense lawyers had limited access to the defendants and case information.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution provides for the inviolability of home and property. There were no
 known cases of arbitrary interference with privacy or correspondence.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of expres-
 sion, thought, and conscience, and the Government enerally respected this right in
 practice with one important exception (see below). Comorians discuss and cnticize
 the Government and its leading personalities openly. The several small independent
 newspapers and weekly semiofficial newspaper freely criticize the Government.
 However, radio is the most important medium for reaching citizens, and in 1994 the
 Government closed down the country's only nongovernment radio station. Credible
 sources cite the station's frequent criticism of the Government and ties to opposition
 politicians as the reasons for its closure.
 There is one government-controlled radio station, Radio Comoros. Comorians re-
 ceive broadcasts from Mayotte radio as well as from French television without inter-
 ference, but these carry only limited news about Comoros developments. Satellite
 antennae are popular and amateur radio licenses are issued without hindrance. For-
 eign news aers are available, as are books from abroad.
 Although t here is no university in the Comoros, secondary teachers and students
 speak freely, and students occasionally engaged in meetings critical of the Govern-
 ment.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 freedom of assembly and association, and the Government generally respects it in
 practice. There were numerous partisan political demonstrations during the year,
 some of which led to violence. On at least one occasion the Government refused an
 opposition party permission to hold a rally.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-An overwhelming majority of the population is Sunni
 Muslim. The Constitution designates Islam as the state religion. The Government
 permits non-Muslims to practice their faith, and Christian missionaries work in
 local hospitals and schools but by tradition are not allowed to proselytize.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-There are no restrictions on travel within the country or abroad, and
 exit visas are freely granted. There are no refugees in Comoros.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Righi-of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens have this right, but it has not yet been fully demonstrated that they, in
 fact, have the ability peacefully to change their government through free and fair
 elections. The Constitution gives legal status to a multiparty system and provides
 
 
 53
 for other fundamental rights. Nevertheless, the political system remains unstable,
 and many democratic institutions established by the Constitution, like the constitu-
 tional court, the senate, and the island councils, had not been created by year's end.
 President Diohar and his party, the RDR, continued to dominate the political proc-
 ess. Several opposition parties accused the Government of fraud in the 1993 elec-
 tion, although they participated during the year in the deliberations of the National
 Assembly.
 Village chiefs and Muslim religious leaders tend to dominate local politics. Tradi-
 tional social, religious, and economic institutions also importantly affect the coun-
 try's political life.
 Traditionally, Comorian society is characterized by male dominance, making it
 very difficult for women to become involved in politics. Women have the right to
 vote and participate in the political process; however, there are no female ministers
 or members of the National Assembly.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The Comoros Human Rights Association, established in 1990, continues to func-
 tion, but many members are unwilling to criticize the Government vigorously for
 fear of losing their civil service positions.
 The Government cooperates with international human rights organizations, in-
 cluding the ICRC. However, it turned down a US. Embassy request to visit prisons
 in 1994 (see Section 1.c.).
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution formally provides for the equality of citizens regardless of race,
 sex, or religion.
 Women.-Despite constitutional provisions for equality, men have the dominant
 role in Comorian society, and few women hold positions of responsibility in govern-
 ment or business. Societal discrimination against women is most apparent outside
 the major towns where women carry heavy farming and child-rearing duties, with
 fewer opportunities for education and wage employment. In contrast, change in the
 status of women is most evident in the major towns, where growing numbers of
 women are in the labor force and generally receive wages comparab e to those of
 men engaged in similar work. While legal discrimination exists in some areas, in
 general inheritance and property rights do not disfavor women; for example, the
 house he father of the bride traditionally provides to the couple at the time of their
 marriage remains her property even in the case of divorce.
 Violence against women occurs, but medical authorities, the police, and women's
 groups believe that it is rare. In theory a woman could seek protection through the
 courts in the case of violence, but in reality the issue would most likely be addressed
 within the extended family or at the village level.
 Children.-The Government, while committed to the protection of children's rights
 and welfare in theory, has an extremely limited ability to put this into practice. Pop-
 ulation pressure and poverty force some families to place their children into the
 homes of others. These children, often as young as 7 years of age, typically work
 long hours as domestic servants in exchange for food and shelter. The ew legal in-
 struments which address the rights and welfare of children are not enforced because
 of a lack of inspectors.
 Female genital mutilation is not generally practiced, and child abuse appears to
 be rare.
 People With Disabilities.-There is no legal protection for people with disabilities,
 but there is no evidence of widespread discrimination against the disabled in the
 provision of education or other services. No legislation is in force or pending con-
 cerning accessibility to public buildings or services for people with disabilities.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution allows workers, including most
 public sector workers, to form unions and to strike, but these rights only became
 a reality in 1990 with the association of some workers into small unions. Farming
 on small landholdings, subsistence fishing, and petty commerce make up the daily
 activity of most of the population. Hence, the wage labor force is smal; less than
 8,800 including government employees, and less than 2,000 excluding them. Teach-
 ers, civil servants, and dock workers have each created unions for purposes of collec-
 tive action. Unions are independent of the Government. Teachers and hospital work-
 ers were on strike for most of the latter half of 1994 over a variety of grievances.
 There are no laws protecting strikers from retribution, but there were no known in-
 stances of retribution in 1994.
 
 
 There are no restrictions on unions joining federations or affiliating with inter-
 national bodies.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Unions have the right to bar-
 gain collectively, and strikes are legal. In reality, with over 75 percent of the work
 orce unemployed and the public sector far and away the largest employer, true col-
 lective bargaining does not take place. Wages are set by employers in the small pri-
 vate sector and by the Government, especially the Ministries of Finance and Labor,
 in the larger public sector.
 The Labor Code, which is only loosely enforced, does not set up a system for re-
 solving labor disputes, and it does not prohibit antiunion discrimination by employ-
 ers.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced or compulsory labor is for-
 bidden by the Constitution and is not practiced.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The Labor Code defines 15 years
 as the minimum age for the employment of children. The Ministry of Labor has few
 resources to enforce this provision but outside of domestic work child labor is not
 an issue due to the general lack of wage employment opportunities for adults. Chil-
 dren generally help with the work of their families in the subsistence farming and
 fishing sectors.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The Government mandates minimum wage
 levels. The rates, which vary by occupation, have not been changed in over a decade
 and no longer reflect economic realities in the Comoros. The minimum wage for a
 laborer is about $11 (4,600 Comorian francs) per month. The Government periodi-
 cally reminds employers to respect the Labor Code, which specifies 1 day off per
 week, plus 1 month of paid vacation per year, but does not set a standard work-
 week. There are no safety or health standards for the minuscule manufacturing sec-
 tor.
