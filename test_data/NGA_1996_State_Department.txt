 NIGERIA
 General Sani Abacha, who seized power in a palace coup in November 1993, re-
 mained Head of State throughout 1996. Under Abacha, the main decisionmaking
 organ is the exclusively military Provisional Ruling Council (PRC), which rules by
 decree. The PRC ovbrsees the 32-member Federal Executive Council composed of
 military officers and civilians. Pending the promulgation of the Constitution written
 by the Constitutional Conference in 1995 and subsequently approved by the Head
 of State, the Government observes some provisions of the 1979 and 1989 Constitu-
 tions. The decree suspending the 1979 Constitution was not repealed and the 1989
 Constitutions has not been implemented. In 1995 Abacha announced a transition
 timetable -which purports to return the country to democratically elected civilian
 government by October 1, 1998.
 The Government continued to enforce its arbitrary authority through the Federal
 Security System (the military, the state security service, and the national police)
 and through decrees blocking action by the opposition in the courts. All branches
 of the security forces committed serious human rights abuses.
 Most of the 100 million population is rural, engaging in small-scale agriculture.
 Nigeria depends on oil exports for over 90 percent of its foreign exchange earnings.
 The economy was estimated to have grown at a higher rate than the 2.2 percent
 of 1995 and the 1.0 percent of 1994, but at little or no margin above the population
 growth rate so that gross domestic product per capita did not change appreciably.
 Even that growth is deceptive, however, since much of it came from the petroleum
 sector with limited effect on the rest of the economy. The general level of economic
 activity continues to be depressed with factory capacity utilization remaining in the
 30 percent range and many major companies reporting lower profits and expanding
 inventories. Endemic corruption further hindered the functioning of the economy.
 The Government has instituted liberalizing economic reforms through its "guided
 deregulation" program, e.g., investment and foreign exchange rules; but its controls
 over the economy remain extensive, including government-mandated, below-market
 fuel prices. There is a continued lack of transparency in government transactions.
 The human rights record remained dismal. Throughout the year, General
 Abacha's Government relied regularly on arbitrary detention and harassment to si-
 lence its many critics. The winner of the annulled 1993 presidential election, Chief
 Moshood K.O. Abiola, remained in detention on charges of treason, and in June un-
 identified persons murdered Abiola's senior wife under mysterious circumstances.
 The Government's investigation to date has been perfunctory. Security forces coin-
 
 
 211
 mitted extrajudicial killings and used excessive force to quell antigovernment pro-
 tests as weli as to combat a growing wave of violent crime, killing and wounding
 a number of persons, including innocent civilians. Police tortured and beat suspects
 and detainees, and prison conditions remained life threatening;, many prisoners died
 in custody. Security services continued routine harassment of human rights and
 prodemocracy groups, including labor leaders, journalists, and student activists. The
 Government also infringed on citizens' right to privacy.
 Citizens do not have the right to change their government by peaceful means. De-
 spite the announced timetable for transitions from military to multiparty rule, there
 was little meaningful progress toward democracy. In the March 16 nonparty local
 elections, the Government disqualified many candidates and promulgated a decree
 allowing replacement without cause of elected officials by government-selected ad-
 ministrators, effectively nulifying the results. Local government elections on a party
 basis, originally scheduled or the fourth quarter of 1996, were postponed until
 1997. The Government's reliance on tribunals, which operate outside the constitu-
 tional court system, and harsh decrees prohibiting judicial review seriously under-
 mine the integrity of the judicial process and often result in legal proceedings that
 deny defendants due process, as in the 1995 cases of Ken Saro-Wiwa and eight oth-
 ers (who were executed) and former Head of State Olusegun Obasanjo (who was
 convicted by a secret military tribunal). Obasanjo, his erstwhile deputy and out-
 spoken National Constitutional Conference delegate Shehu Musa Yar'Adua, and
 more than 20 others, remained in prison for their roles in an alleged March 1995
 coup plot. The Government's frequent refusal to respect court rulings also undercuts
 the independence and integrity of the judicial process.
 Other human rights problems included infringements on freedom of speech, press,
 assembly, association, travel, and workers rights, and violence and discrimination
 against women. There were many reports of sexual abuse of female prisoners. The
 regime established a National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) in June, but it
 was never taken seriously by nongovernmental human rights groups and by year's
 end had no discernible effect on the human rights climate.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-As in previous years, police and se-
 curity services commonly committed extrajudicial killings and used excessive force
 to quell antigovernment and prodemocracy protests. Credible,.though unconfirmed,
 reports by Nigerian human rights groups indicate numerous deaths of suspects in
 police custody. These reports are consistent with other credible reports of police
 abuse, including the use of torture to extract criminal confessions. The Government
 seldom holds police and security forces accountable for their use of excessive, deadly
 force or for the death of individuals in custody. The Government's actions have fos-
 tered a climate of impunity in which these abuses flourish. Increasing and wide-
 spread violent crime prompted police to employ roadblocks and checkpoints where
 extortion, violence, and lethal force are common.
 In one widely reported incident, Lukman Ololade, an independent bus driver, was
 shot by police in early February as he and other drivers attempted to push his dis-
 abled minibus to the side of the read. According to transport workers present at the
 time, police officers stopped by the bus and an argument ensued between the offi-
 cers and transport workers. In the course of the argument, a policeman opened fire,
 fatally wounding Ololade. The Committee for the Defense of Human Rights, a Nige-
 rian nongovernmental organization (NGO), highlighted in its September newsletter
 the deaths of a bus driver and passenger shot by a security officer as the bus passed
 a roadside checkpoint. Accounts of security officers shooting at transport workers
 and individual drivers who refuse to pay bribes at checkpoints or appear "sus-
 picious" were common.
 There were several reports that the Lagos State Environmental Task Force (see
 Section 1.c.) members also killed citizens who failed to stop at checkpoints or comply
 with task force orders.
 Credible reports of mobile anticrime police shooting people suspected of armed
 robbery continued throughout the year. On October 24, four armed suspects in a
 carjacking near a foreign embassy in Lagos were shot and killed by police officers.
 Two of the suspects were fatally woundedwhile attempting to flee; eyewitnesses re-
 ported that the other two suspects were injured and disabled by police during the
 chase and subsequently shot dead 50 fe from the gate of an embassy. Reliable
 sources reported that police officers involved acted under standing instructions to
 shootkin  nea akiegllasyi.ao wr                htad ildb          ic  fies
 
 
 212
 In September 39 people were reported dead in the northern cities of Kaduna and
 Zaria aer police attempted to break up demonstrations protesting the detention of
 Muslim cleric and religious leader Sheikh Ibrahim Al-Zakzaky. The Civil Liberties
 Organization (CLO) reported that the protesters were unarmed and the demonstra-
 tions peaceful until police fired tear gas into the crowd, creating confusion. During
 the resulting melee, police opened fire, killing and wounding both protestors and po-
 lice officers.
 The harsh interrogation methods reportedly practiced by some security officers re-
 sulted in the deaths while in custody of several people. Joseph Kporok, a 30-year-
 old Movement for the Survival of the Ogoni People (MOSOP) activist, was arrested
 after a dispute with his mother-in-law over land. Once in custody at the Rivers state
 internal security task force headquarters, Kporok was interrogated about his Mosop
 affiliation and beaten. He was then transferred to state police headquarters in Port
 Harcourt where he died on October 22. In July, 26-year-old Kenneth Nwokoye was
 beaten to death by uniformed officers who arrested him after raiding and searching
 his house. The officers did not present a search or arrest warrant.
 Paralleling the year's noticeable increase in violent crime was the mysterious and
 brutal murder in June of Kudirat Abiola, the senior wife of M.K.O. Abiola, who was
 shot in her car multiple times by unknown persons. The Government conducted a
 perfunctory investigation of the murder that included the detention of leading Na-
 tional Democratic Coalition (NADECO) activists and Abiola family members. All
 have been released. There have been no further arrests.
 In November Suliat Adedeji, an outspoken politician and successful business-
 woman, was beaten and shot by armed men who invaded her home in Ibadan. De-
 ite brutal demands for "ransom," nothing was taken from the Adedeji home. Alex
 9bm, publisher of The Guardian, one of the country's leading independent daily
 newspapers, was shot and permanently injured in February by gunmen.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no confirmed reports of politically motivated dis-
 appearances. However, government detention practices have the effect of causing
 many persons to be "missing" for extended periods (see Section 1.d.).
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The 1979 Constitution (suspended) and the 1989 Constitution (never implemented)
 prohibit torture and mistreatment of prisoners and provide criminal sanctions for
 such excesses. The Evidence Act of 1960 prohibits the introduction of evidence ob-
 tained through torture. Nevertheless, detainees frequently die while in custody (see
 Section L.a.), and there were credible reports that police seeking to extract confes-
 sions regularly tortured and beat suspects and that interrogators beat and nearly
 tortured to death convicted 'coup plotters". The authorities reportedly tortured con-
 victed coup plotter and TSM magazine editor in chief Chris Anyanwu while in de-
 tention, and they beat Bunmi Aborishade, editor of the defunct June 12 weekly,
 when he was arrested in April. Detainees are regularly kept incommunicado for long
 periods of time (see Section 1.d.).
 There were numerous credible reports of torture in Ogoniland perpetrated by the
 Rivers State Internal Security Task Force. The abuses reportedly increased just be-
 fore the April visit of the United Nations fact-finding team dispatched to examine
 human rights and the transition process. Abuses continued at the higher level
 throughout the remainder of the year. In, March there were credible reports that
 task force members beat and detained Ogonis who refused to leave their homes as
 instructed or otherwise attempted to foil alleged government plans to replace resi-
 dents with government agents in preparation for the U.N. team's visit. The most
 egregious example was the case of Nsaa Korsi, an elderly widow, who refused the
 soldiers' demands to leave her house. They dragged her out, flogged her, and walked
 on her back while wearing boots. She reportedly suffered brain and spinal damage
 to the extent that she can no longer walk or speak coherently.
 Early in the Abacha regime, Lagos state administrator, Colonel Olagunsoye
 Oyinlola, formed the Lagos State Environmental Task Force as part of its "war on
 indiscipline and corruption." Under Colonel Oyinlola's direct supervision, the task
 force used brutal force on individuals in its attempts to rid Lagos of illegal street
 traders and copious accumulated garbage. task force soldiers routinely beat and ar-
 rested anyone they perceived as "undisciplined," usually unarmed market women
 and traders, but also including jaywalkers, errant drivers, children, and young
 street hawkers. For the most part, the Government neither acknowledged nor de-
 nied that these abuses occurred and left their perpetrators unpunished. However,
 new Lagos state administrator Colonel M.B. Marwa has acknowledged that there
 have been abuses and said he would try to curb them.
 There also were reliable reports of caning used as a form of punishment for minor
 infractions or public disturbances.
 
 
 Prison conditions remain life threatening. Lack of potable water, inadequate sew-
 age facilities, and shortage of medical supplies result in deplorable sanitary condi-
 tions. Disease runs rampant in the cramped, poorly ventilated facilities. Prison in-
 mates are seldom allowed outside their cells for recreation, and many inmates must
 rovide their own food. In such cases, only those with money or whose relatives
 bring food regularly have something to eat. Poor inmates rely on handouts from oth-
 ers to survive. Prison officials and police often deny inmates food and medical treat-
 ment as a form of punishment or to extort money from them. Many prisoners are
 routinely denied adequate medication and medical care. Severe overcrowding wors-
 ens the problem. For example, Ikoyi Prison in Lagos, built to house about 800 in-
 mates holds over 2,000. The convicted "coup plotters" and other detainees have
 been dispersed to various prisons around the country since October 1995, hindering
 access to their families and food.
 Reports of sexual abuse of female prisoners are common. The Government derives
 considerable savings from the practice of leavingchildren brn in prison with their
 jailed mothers rather than placing them in foster homes.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The regime repeatedly engaged in arbi-
 trary arrest and detention. Police are empowered to make arrests without warrants
 if they believe that there is a reasonable suspicion that a person committed an of-
 fense; they often abuse this power. The law requires that the arresting officer in-
 form the accused of charges at the time of arrest and take that person to a station
 for processing within a reasonable time. By law, police must provide suspects with
 the opportunity to engage counsel and to post bail. However, police generally do not
 adhere to these safeguards and often hold suspects incommumcado under harsh con-
 ditions for extended periods without charge. Over 100 supporters of Shi'ite religious
 leader Sheikh Ibrahim Al-Zakzaky (see Section L.a.) were arrested during and after
 public protests over his detention in the northern part of the country. The detained
 supporters were scheduled to appear in court in late December, but officials said
 "security concerns" precluded their appearance in public. By year's end no action
 had been taken to prosecute or release the detainees. Accurate numbers of detainees
 were unavailable, but official sources put the number at "over 100 but probably less
 than 200."
 Police also commonly place relatives and friends of wanted suspects in detention
 without criminal charge to induce suspects to surrender to arrest (see Section 1.f.).
 Police detained a 13-year-old boy with British citizenship in April and held him for
 a month when Directorate of Military Intelligence officials were seeking to arrest
 the boy's Nigerian relative. He was eventually released following intervention by a
 foreign gvernment.
 The State Security (Detention of Persons) Decree of 1984 (Decree Two) allows the
 Government to detain without charge persons suspected of acts prejudicial to state
 security or harmful to the economic well-being of the country. When invoked, the
 decree suspends the detainee's civil liberties and precludes judicial review. Many
 citizens consider Decree Two the main threat to their basic freedoms because the
 judicial ouster clause encourages arbitrary detention and fails to define what con-
 stitutes acts under the decree's purview. Decree 11 of 1994 authorizes the PRC Vice
 Chairman or the Commissioner of Police to detain persons for up to 3 months.
 In June the Government announced the repeal of Decree 14 of 1994, which had
 effectively suspended the right of habeas corpus by forbidding courts to hear cases
 demanding the Government produce in court those detained under Decree Two of
 1984. The Government also announced a decree amending the Civil Disturbances
 (Special Tribunal) Decree of 1987 to remove members of the armed forces from the
 membership of the tribunal and allow for a right of appeal by a convicted person
 to the Special Appeal Tribunal (see Section i.e.). At year's end, the full details of
 the new decrees were not known as the texts had not yet been released. However,
 despite the new decrees, the Government still retains full authority under Decree
 Two and Decree 12 of 1994 to detain citizens and dispense with habeas corpus chal-
 lenqges.
 Thre Government routinely arrested and detained without charge leading human
 rights and prodemocracy activists, including prominent attorney Gani Fawehinmi in
 January, and in February human rights activist lawyer Femi Falana and
 prodemocracy activist and organizational secretary of Fawehini's National Con-
 science Party Feni Aborisade. Immediately prior to a November visit by representa-
 tives of the Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group to review the human rights
 situation, the Government released Fawehinmi, Falana, and Aborisade.
 In June following the murder of Kudirat Abiola (see Section l.a.), senior wife of
 M.K.O. Abiola, the authorities detained seven Abiola family members and four
 prominent members of the opposition group NADECO in connection with Mrs.
 Abiola's murder. All seven family members were released in July. One of the
 
 
 NADECO members, octogenarian Solanke Onasanya, was released after 3 weeks to
 seek medical attention. The three remaining NADECO       members, Abraham
 A deanya, age 74, Ayo Adebayo, age 68, and Ganiu Dawodu, age 63, remained in
 detention without charge for several months.
 The Government released several prominent detainees in June just before the
 Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group was set to meet in London to consider is-
 sues including additional sanctions. The authorities held Tunji Abayonii, chairman
 of the Founder's Council of Human Rights Africa and Obasanjo's lawyer, originally
 detained in July 1995, until June; FredEno, an aide to M.K.O. Abiola, from August
 1994 to June; and Abdul Oroh, executive director of the CL) from July 1995 to
 June. Ayo Opadokun, General Secretary of NADECO, who had been detained since
 October 1994, was released June 25, only to be rearrested the following day and
 held in detention without charge until November 2. Expectations that the rleases
 might presage real human rights improvements were not fulfilled, as the Govern-
 ment continued its policies of arbitrary arrest and detention including the Decem-
 ber arrest and detention of prodemocracy activist Dr. Fred Fasehun and former
 p residential candidate and NADECO supporter Olabiyi Durojaiye. Both remained in
 detention at year's end.
 Several leading labor and prodemocracy activists who were arrested in 1993 re-
 mained in detention, including M.K.O. Abiola and Frank Kokori, General Secretary
 of the National Union of Petroleum and Natural Gas Workers (NUPENG). In Janu-
 ary security forces arrested Milton Dabibi, who was General Secretary of the Petro-
 leum and Natural Gas Senior Staff Association (PENGASSAN) before the Govern-
 ment dissolved the executive structure of the union and installed a sole adminis-
 trator. At year's end, Dabibi remained in detention (see Section 6.a.).
 The Government routinely detained human rights monitors, journalists, and polit-
 ical opponents for making or publishing critical statements (see Sections 2.a., 2 b.
 and 4). Government security forces also frequently harassed, arrested, and detained
 journalists for a variety of reasons, including the alleged spreading of false informa-
 tion and stories that exposed the actions of government officials.
 Often the authorities did not charge detainees but held them for brief periods and
 questioned them about their activities and statements. In September security agents
 briefly detained and beat a Nigerian employee of the information service of a foreign
 embassy in Abuja after she refused to answer questions concerning the nature of
 her work.
 The total prison population is estimated at 70,000. A precise figure for the num-
 ber of persons detained without charge is unavailable. However, the Constitutional
 Rights Project, which recently completed a study on the failure of prosecution of
 criminal suspects, estimates that 40,000 prisoners, nearly 60 percent of the total
 rison population, are still awaiting trial. Official government figures put the num-
 r of prisoners awaiting trial at almost the same level, 35,575. Some have been
 detained as long as 12 years without trial.
 There are no reliable figures for the number of political detainees, but local
 human rights groups' estimates range between 100 and 200 (see also Section .e.).
 At year's end, M.kO. Abiola remained in prison despite a November 1994 ruling
 by the Kaduna Federal High Court of Appeals granting him bail on the condition
 that he "not disturb the peace." In May 1995, eight Supreme Court justices, includ-
 ing Chief Justice Mohammed Bello, withdrew from hearing the case because of a
 libel suit they had pending against Abiola's Concord Press, effectively suspending
 hearings on Abiola's appeal until new justices were named to the Court. Abiola's
 trial on treason charges remained suspended indefinitely on orders from the regime.
 There were no known instances of forced exile as a means of political control, al-
 though several NADECO members, including former Senator Bola Tinabu, retired
 Air Commodore Dan Suleiman, Nobel laureate Wole Soyinka, and elder statesman
 and senior NADECO figure Anthony Enahoro live in self-imposed exile. Other activ-
 ists such as Owens Wiwa, brother of executed minority rights activist Ken Saro-
 Wiwa, and his wife Diana joined them. An unknown number of Ogoni reportedly
 fled to neighboring countries, North America, or Europe in search of asylum.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Government has taken several steps to under-
 cut the independence and integrity of the judiciary. To suppress opposition to its
 rule, the regime first bypassed the regular courts in favor of "tribunals" and then
 declared itself above the law by prohibiting court review of any government action.
 Tribunal sentences are generally severe. The Government's reliance on tribunals,
 which operate outside the constitutional court system, seriously undermine the in-
 tegrity of the judicial process and often result in legal proceedings that deny defend-
 ants due process, as the case of Ken Saro-Wiwa and his eight codefendants. The
 Government's frequent refusal to respect court rulings also undermines the integrity
 of the judicial process.
 
 
 215
 The regular court system is composed of both federal and state trial courts, state
 appeals courts, the federal Court of Appeal, and the federal Supreme Court. Under
 the 1979 Constitution, courts of the irst instance include magistrate or district
 courts, customary or area courts, Shari'a (Islamic) courts, and for some specified
 2ases, the state high courts. The nature of the case usually determines which court
 has jurisdiction. In principle customary and Shari'a courts have jurisdiction only if
 both plaintiff and defendant agree. In practice, however, fear of legal cost, delay,
 and distance to alternative courts encourage many litigants to choose these courts.
 Decree One of 1984, the basic Constitution (modification and suspension) decree,
 the first decree promulgated by the military officers who overthrew the civilian re-
 gime of President Shehu Usman Aliyul Shagari in 1983, left the institutional frame-
 work of the judiciary relatively intact. However, it established a parallel system of
 military tribunals with sole jurisdiction over certain offenses, such as coup plotting,
 corruption, armed robbery, and illegal sale of petroleum. A 1991 decree amended
 Decree One by providing that only sitting or retired civilian judges maypreside over
 tribunals hearing nonMilitary cases. Decree 12 states that "no act of-the federal
 military Government may henceforth be questioned in a court of law" and "divests
 all courts of jurisdiction in all matters concerning the authority of the federal Gov-
 ernment."
 Criminal justice procedures call for trial within 3 months of arraignment for most
 categories of crimes. Inefficient administrative procedures, petty extortion, bureau-
 cratic inertia, poor communication between police and prison officials, and inad-
 equate transportation continue to result in considerable delays, often stretching to
 several years in bringing suspects to trial
 Trials in the regular court system are public and generally respect constitu-
 tionally protected individual rights, including a presumption of innocence, the right
 to be present, to confront witnesses, tpresent evidence, and to be represented by
 legal counsel. However, there is a wdespread perception that judges are easily
 bribed or "settled," and that litigants cannot rely on the courts to render impartial
 judgment.
 There are no legal provisions barring women or other groups from testifying in
 civil court or giving their testimony less weight. The testimony of women is, how-
 ever, accordedness weight in Shari'a courts.
 In most cases before the tribunals, the accused have the right to legal counsel,
 bail, and appeal, although some tribunals substitute a presumption of guilt for the
 presumption of innocence, and conviction rates in the tribunals reportedly exceed
 conviction rates in the regular courts.
 In practie tribunal proceedings often deny defendants due p recess as in the trial
 before the Ogoni Civiliisturbancs Special Tribunal of Ken Sare-Wiwa and others
 for their alleged roles in the killings of four prominent Ogoni politicians in May
 1994. On October 31, 1995, the Tribunal announced guilty verdicts and death sen-
 tences for Saro-Wiwa and eight other activists. The PRC "confirmed" this decision
 on November 8, 1995, and quickly executed all nine on November 10, 1995. In that
 case, the Government refused to comply with a tribunal order to produce a video-
 tape recorded on May 22, 1994, with Rivers' state administrator Lt. Colonel Dauda
 Komo who proclaimed in advance that Sare-Wiwa was "guilty of murder." This led
 the 18-member defense team, led by Gani Fawehinmi, to withdraw in protest.
 In June in response to the report of the U.N. fact-finding team sent to investigate
 human rights and the transition process, the Government announced two decrees,
 one repealing Decree 14 of 1994 which had effectively suspended the right of habeas
 corpus (see Section 1.d.) and the other amending the Civil Disturbances (Special Tri-
 bunal) Decree of 1987 to remove members of the armed forces from the membership
 of the tribunal and allow for a right of appeal to the Special Appeal Tribunal. While
 the texts had not yet been released yyear's end, the Government quickly clarified
 that appeals to the Special Appeals ri unal would not be allowed for military per-
 sonnel convicted of coup plotting. It remained silent regarding appeals for civilians
 convicted of coup plotting, but all indications are that the new decree was never
 meant todapply    t   e hem.
 Additional Ogo i defendants were arrested in 1994, one of whom died while in
 custody. Known as the Ogoni 19, these individuals were arraigned in July in connec-
 tion with the murder of the 40goni politicians. The new decree amending the Civil
 Disturbances (Special Tribunal) Decree of 1987 would seem topreclude the possibil-
 ity of the Ogoni 19 being tried by a Special Tribunal. At yearWs end, no significant
 progres had been made in the case.
 A motion demanding the immediate release of the detainees filed by the law of-
 ices led by Azibaola Robert was thrown out by the High Court on a technicality.
 Moreover, government agents subjected the Ogonis' lawyers to harassment and in-
 timidation. In addition to surveillance, government agents arrested the lawyers fol-
 
 
 216
 lowing a court appearance in July when the agents tried to force a photographer,
 who had been brought to court to take pictures of the accused, to surrender his cam-
 era. The ensuing scuffle caused the magistrate, who had granted permission for the
 photographs with no objection from the prosecution, to seize the camera pending a
 decision on the matter. The agents reported back to their superiors, who imme-
 diately dispatched agents to arrest the lawyers and the photographer. The photog-
 rapher escaped detention because he was not in the room at the time, but the
 agents seized his camera from the magistrate. The Government is pursuing prosecu-
 tioon of the     ooe arres the the photographer, an em-
 ployee of The Vanguard newspaper. At year's end, the lawyers were no longer in
 custody, but subjected to continued harassment.
 The number of political prisoners (as distinct from political detainees) held by the
 Government is also unknown (see Section 1.d.). Thirty-five individuals convicted in
 1995 by a secret military tribunal of coup plotting and related charges remained in
 prison. These included former Head of State Olusegun Obasanjo; his erstwhile dep-
 uty and National Constitutional Conference delegate Shehu Musa Yar'Adua; editor
 in chief of The Sunday Magazine Chris Anyanwu; Tell magazine assistant editor
 George Mbah; The News magazine editor Kunle Ajibade; Weekend Classique editor
 Ben Charles Obi; and chairman of the prominent human rights organization Cam-
 paign for Democracy (CD) Beko Ransome-Kuti. They continued to serve reduced
 sentences which still ran as long as 25 years.
 The only exceptions were six individuals convicted in the alleged coup plot who
 were released in March at the completion of their commuted sentences, although
 their families had to file petitions in court to obtain their release. Queenette
 Allogo, also sentenced to 6 months, remained in prison despite having finished her
 sentence. The Government offered no explanation for her continued detention.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-Provi-
 sions of the 1979 and 1989 Constitutions provide for the rights to privacy in the
 home, in correspondence, and in oral electronic communications. However, the mili-
 tary Government regularly interfered in the lives of citizens, and if the authorities
 desired to use a warrant in a particular search case, they often secured it from a
 military tribunal rather than a regular court. Human rights and prodemocracy lead-
 ers reported that security agents regularly followed them and cut off or monitored
 their organizations' telephones. Police routinely detain relatives and friends of sus-
 pects without charge to induce suspects to surrender (see Section 1.d.). Credible
 sources report an increase in harassment and intimidation of citizens by  ice and
 military units in Ogoniland following the late March to early April visito  he  nit-
 ed Nations fact-inding team sent to investigate human rights and the transition
 program. Abuses perpetrated in Ogoniland included arbitrary detention without
 charge and random search of houses and cars without warrants or probable cause.
 The November 10 ferst anniversary of the hanging of the Ogoni 9 passed largely
 without incident. As has been done in the past, the Govenent prevented the hold-
 ing of even peaceful public demonstrations of mourning, including the wearing of
 black clothing. Fear of government reprisals kept most people indoors and a strict
 curfew enforced by security officials stopped many planned memorial services and
 all public displays of mourning.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-Constitutional provisions providing for freedom
 of speech and the press are not enforceable because of continued suspension of con-
 stitutional rights. The Abacha regime often publicly declared its support for these
 freedoms, but it nevertheless sought to limit or confie public political dialog. The
 regime also increased its systematic intimidation of the press through legal and ex-
 tralegal means throughout the year.
 Although there is a large and vibrant indigenous independent press which is fre-
 quently critical of the Government, the Governmen a so owns or controls many
 newspapers. All newspapers and magazines are required to register with the Gov-
 ernment under the Newspaper Registration Board Decree 43 of 1993, and the Min-
 ister of Culture and Information declared in December that beginning in 1997 any
 publication not registered with the board will be prosecuted. The fee for registration
 is high. The Abacha regime has, at various times, shut down independent news-
 papers for various offenses. Journalists continue to be subject to close scrutiny and
 routine harassment by security forces.
 The Government granted broadcasting rights to private radio stations in 1994, but
 it keeps a careful watch over radio broadcasts, the most important means of reach-
 ing the public. In May the National Broadcasting Commission banned Ray Power,
 a private Lagos radio station, from transmitting British Broadcasting Corporation
 (BBC) programs, ostensibly under Decree 38, which states that transmissions must
 
 
 have equity and reciprocity. Since BBC does not broadcast Nigerian programs, Ray
 Power could not broadcast BBC programs. Television, both Nigerian and otherwise,
 is widely available. Access is limited more by substandard cable installation, elec-
 trical power surges and outages, and technical broadcasting difficulties than by gov-
 ernment intervention. However, government-controlled broadcast media still domi-
 nate the country, and even private broadcasters do not transmit stories that criticize
 the Government.
 Throughout the year, government security agents frequently harassed, arrested,
 and detained journalists. Four journalists convicted of involvement in an alleged
 1995 coup plot remained in prison (see Section i.e.). The Government detained with-
 out charge Nsa Igiebr, editor in chief of Tell magaine, from December 1995 to
 June. In March the Government briefly detained Emeka Omeihe, editor of the news-
 paper Daily Champion, and three top editorial staff of The Guardian newspaper
 over reports in their newspapers that the Directorate of Military Intelligence (DMI)
 had ruled out sabotage in the presidential plane crash in January that killed
 hi-ahiim Abache the Head of State's son. Others detained for shorter or longer peri-
 ods, usually without charge, included in April B~unmi Aborishade, editor of the de-
 funct weekly June 12; in May George Onah, defense correspondent of The Vanguard
 newspaper, who remained in custody at year's end; in May Tunji Adegboyega, editor
 of The Pinch newspaper, for a front-page story relating to the arson attack on the
 home of one of the prominent NADECO members in self-exile; also in May, Kate
 Odigie-Oyegun, the general manager of the newspaper company that publishes The
 Observer over a story that speculated about changes in the military following large-
 scale military promotions to the rank of general; in August Alphonsus Agborh, The
 Punch newspaper's Port Harcourt correspondent, for a story concerning imported
 arms; and in September Ola Awoniyi, Abuja bureau chief for The Nigerian Tribune
 after reporting allegtions of espionage and corruption in the Air Force.
 Virtually all senior editors of the weeklies Tell, Dateline, The News, and Tempo,
 and the daily A.M. News are subject to surveillance and harassment by security
 agents. They have been driven underground by constant fear of arrest and now op-
 erate clandestinely from numerous scattered locations throughout Lagos. Security
 forces routinely seized entire runs of Tell magazine when cover stories offended the
 Government. Agents harassed and intimidated vendors and printers to the point
 that in some parts of the country Tell is no longer available. The seizures and in-
 timidation caused great financial distress for Tell and were partially responsible for
 the weekly's decision to discontinue publication of its sister magazine Dateline.
 The Government also denied entry to and threatened to deport foreign journalists.
 Christian Science Monitor and Financial Times correspondent Paul Adams was ar-
 rested in January and detained incommunicado for several days. He was released
 on bail in mid-January, but his trial on trumped-up charges ofpossession of "sedi-
 tious" materials dragged on until he was finally acquitted in April. In February a
 U.S. citizen working as a BBC correspondent was detained and held incommunicado
 for a day. The Government gave no reason for her arrest and never charged her
 with any crime. However, it was clear that the Government was not pleased by her
 aggressive research into reports of a possible coup attempt. Numerous other journal-
 ists had to cancel trips because they were unable to obtain visas. In addition to
 harassing individual journalists, the Government attacked the foreign press by
 blocking the distribution of international editions of foreign publications such as
 Newsweek that carried stories unfavorable to the regime.
 The military Government used a number of other means to intimidate the press.
 These included a decree banning government offices from advertising in nongovern-
 ment media, periodic directives to government offices forbidding the purchase of cer-
 tain publications, personal attacks by government-controlled media against journal-
 ists and others who challenged government policies, and threats of harassment of
 potential advertisers and investors in antigovernment publications. The Information
 Minister has repeatedly made intimidating speeches against the prodemocracy
 press. There are credible reports that he sent a letter to the advertising practition-
 ers association cautioning members to avoid advertising in such prodemocracy publi-
 cations as AM News, PM News, TSM, and Tell, or risk losing government patron-
 age. In December he announced that the Ministry would establish "press courts" to
 try journalists who write "false" reports. Other common means of harassment in-
 clude the disruption of public performances, conferences, book promotions, and other
 forums that security forces believe prodemocracy groups use to spread their mes-
 In February security forces canceled the performance of a play written by self-ex-
 iled Nobel prize winner Wole Sayinka. In March they prevented NADECO members
 from meeting with a United Nations team sent to Nigeria to examine human rights
 and the transition to democracy; broke up a conference in Jos sponsored by a foreign
 
 
 218
 ti information service entitled "Dilemmas of Democracy," briefl  arresting
 two of the organizers and dispersing the participants; shut down the CLO-spnsoreg
 launch of the book 'The Church and Human Rights: A Human Rights Education
 Manual for Churches;" and canceled the American Studies Association of Nigeria
 (ASAN) fifth annual conference in Kaduna. In April security forces canceled the in-
 troduction of a book at the government-affiliated Nigerian Institute of International
 Affairs by a former governor with strong ties to NADECO. In May armed policemen
 forcibly canceled a Nigerian Union of Journalists lecture and meeting with 100 jour-
 nalists marking the first anniversary of the arrest and detention of four colleagues
 sentenced to 15 years' imprisonment for coup plotting (see Section i.e.).
 Academic freedom is generally respected, a1though security forces routinely mon-
 itor and on occasion break up conferences they perceive as forums for prodemocracy
 groups (see SeCtion 2.b.). The Government tape records faculty conversations. The
 Government in May banned all activities on a national level by the National Asso-
 ciation of Nigerian Students (NANS). The Government also banned university staff
 unions (see Section 6.a.). Nigerian embassies often refuse to issue visas to visiting
 lecturers and musicians. This policy has precluded discussions between foreign and
 Nigerian academicians on topics of mutual interest.
 Some student groups believe university authorities follow government directives
 to suspend or expel activist students. On August 26 in Bauchi, the authorities de-
 tained for a day four professors belonging to the striking Academic Staff Union of
 Universities (ASUU) (see Section 6.a.).
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The two Constitutions provide
 citizens with the right to assemble freely and associate with other persons in politi-
 cal parties, trade unions, or other special interest associations. However, the Gov-
 ernment proscribed all political activity 1 day after coming to power in 1993. The
 Government arbitrarily canceled or prevented a number of public meetings during
 the year, including cultural events, academic conferences, book promotions, and
 human rights meetings (see also Section 2.a.).
 While permits are not normally required for public meetings indoors, and permit
 requirements for outdoor public functions are often ignored by both government au-
 thorities and those assembling, the Abacha Government retained legal provisions
 adopted by the Babangida government, banning gatherings whose political, ethnic,
 or religious content it believed might lead to unrest. Security forces used permit re-
 quirements as one of the justifications for their regular practice of disrupting
 prodemocracy conferences, book introductions, and seminars. Open-air religious
 services away from places of worship remained prohibited in most states due to reli-
 gious tensions in various parts of the country (see also Section 2.c.).
 In August 1994, General Abacha announced that 'individuals or groups may
 henceforth canvass politica1 ideas, but they cannot form political parties for now."
 In June 1995, Abacha announced a partial lifting of the ban on political activity,
 but it was not until June that a reconstituted National Electoral Commission of Ni-
 geria (NECON) finally announced cumbersome and impractical requirements for
 registering political parties. NECON gave the parties an unrealistic 6-week period
 in which to satisfy such requirements as registering 40,000 members in each of the
 30 states and 15,000 in the federal capital territory of Abuja, as well as issuing
 photo identification cards to each of them. Despite the practical impossibility of sat-
 isfying NECON's requirements, 23 parties purchased registration forms from
 NECON for approximately $6,000; 18 of them submitted the forms and supporting
 documentation by the July 25 deadline. In response to widespread protests over the
 party registration process, NECON announced a new exercise allowing the 18
 groups to apply for mergers. The merger requests had to be accompanied by another
 burdensome set of documentation, including a party resolution agreeing to the merg-
 er; the new name, constitution, acronym, symbol, and manifesto of the party;, ad-
 dresses of the national, state, and local government area and council level chapters
 of the party;, and the names of proposed executive staff at all levels of the organiza-
 tion. By September NECON announced the registration of five parties and ordered
 dissolved all unregistered political parties, effectively preventing the participation of
 other political parties, which included the majority of established politicians and po-
 tential opposition leaders.
 Although Abacha announced the lifting of all restrictions on political activities in
 his October 1, 1995, Independence Day address, he did not issue the enabling decree
 until February. The Government continued to repress the political activities of oplo-
 sition groups. In February the Government announced three new decrees lifting the
 restrictions on political activity, laying out the transition timetable, and empowering
 the transition bodies. When the texts of the decrees were released in March, how-
 ever, it became clear that the regime had negated its decree lifting restrictions on
 political activity by including language that established vague new categories of
 
 
 219
 crimes for impeding the transition to democracy and imposed a penalty of 5 years
 in prison for those found guilty of such crimes. This action effectively allowed the
 regime to remove its opponents from the political scene until after the completion
 of the transition timetable (see Section 3).
 Religious, professional, and other organizations need not register with the Govern-
 ment and are generally permitted to associate freely with other national and foreign
 bodies, The PRC retained its ban on several political organizations that it contended
 were founded primarily along ethnic, tribal, religious, or other parochial lines for the
 purpose of sponsoring various political candidates.
 c. Fredom of Relugion.-The Government generally respects freedom of belief,
 practice, and religious education provided for by the suspended 1979 and 1989 Con-
 stitutions. Both Constitutions also prohibit state and local governments from adopt-
 ing a state religion. The Government instituted a ban in 1987 (which is still in ef-
 fect) on religious organizations on campuses of primary schools, although individual
 students retain the right to practice their religion in recognized places of worship.
 In Kwara state in March, state authorities ordered the closure of Christian
 schools that refused to include Islamic studies in their curriculum. Reportedly, the
 Christian community in Kwara state was refusing to teach Islamic studies in Chris-
 tian schools because Islamic schools are not being required to teach Christian stud-
 ies. After the transfer of the state military admimstrator, the situation was resolved
 and the Christian schools reopened. No further incidents have been reported.
 Distribution of religious publications is generally unrestricted. There is a lightly
 enforced ban on published religious advertisements, and religious programming on
 television and radio remains closely controlled by the Government. Both Christian
 and Muslim organizations allege that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Immi-
 gration Department continue to restrict the entry into the country of certain reli-
 gious practitioners, particularly persons suspected of proselytizing. While it has not
 outlawed the practice, the Government discourages proselytizing in the belief that
 it stirs up religious tensions, particularly in the predominantly Islamic north. The
 Government also bans open-air religious services away from places of worship (see
 Section 2.b.).
 In September the authorities arrested Shia activist Ibrahim al-Zakzaky (see Sec-
 tion 1.d.) and charged him with an alleged attempt to set up a clandestine radio
 station.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The two Constitutions entitle citizens to move freely throughout the
 country and reside where they wish. However, increasing violent crime in many
 parts of the country prompted police to set up roadblocks and checkpoints, where
 officers commonly engaged in extortion, violence, and excessive use of force.
 The Constitutions also prohibit expulsion or the denial of exit or entry to any citi-
 zen. In practice, however, women must often obtain permission from a male family
 member before being granted a passport, and the Government, like its predecessors,
 occasionally prevented travel for political reasons. Throughout the year, the Govern-
 ment routinely seized the passports of its critics, including those of Movement for
 the Survival of Ogoni People (MOSOP) Vice President Ledum Mitee, CLO President
 Ayo Obe, Nigerian Association of University Women President and Af ican-Amer-
 ican Institute program representative Clara Osinulu, lawyer Priscilla Kuye, United
 Nations hunger award recipient Chief Bisi Ogunleye, and human rights activist,
 lawyer, and CLO cofounder Olisa Agbakoba.
 Journalists reported harassment at the nation's airports by security officials
 throughout the year, including having to fill out a special entry and exit form detail-
 ing their movements abroad, reasons for making their trip, and names of friends
 and associates overseas. Security officials harassed or temporarily confiscated the
 passports of journalists who refused to complete the form. The Government assigned
 security personnel to Murtala Mohammed International Airpor (MMIA) to screen
 e ers to apprhend prodemcr  supprters. Government securit
 agents questioned extensively citizens who ha dbeen issued United States visas. If
 the agents were not satisfied with the responses, they had orders to seize passports
 and turn the citizens over to military intelligence and state security service person-
 nel for additional questioning.
 The Government cooperates with the Lagos Office of the United Nations High
 Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR    and oi  er humanitarian agencies in assisting
 refugees through the National Comsion for Refugees and the Federal Commis-
 sioner. Regulations governing the granting of refugee status, asylum, and resettle-
 ment are outlined in Decree 52 of 1989 which incorporates many aspects of the 1951
 U.N. Convention. Refugee and resettlement applications are reviewed by the Eligi-
 bility Committee established under Decree 52. A representative from the UNHCR
 participates in the Eligibility Committee.
 
 
 There are an estimated 5,000 Liberian, 1,400 Chadian, 1,500 Cameroonian, 140
 Ghanaian, and an undetermined number of Togolese, Somalian, Sudanese, and
 Ethiopian refugees. The issue of the provision of first asylum did not arise in 1996
 and has not arisen since the establishment of the National Commission for Refugees
 under Decree 52. There were no reports that refugees were expelled.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens could not exercise this right in 1996, and there was little indication that
 General Abacha's military regime was willing to permit them to do so on any basis
 other than a process tightly controlled by the regime. Throughout the year, the re-
 gime committed numerous, repeated, and egregious human rights abuses in its ef-
 fort to prevent citizens from opposing it by peaceful political means.
 After coming to power, the Provisional Ruling Council headed by General Abacha
 promised to return to civilian, democratic rule but did not provide a timetable until
 Abacha's 1995 Independence Day address. Then Abacha announced a transition
 timetable, leading to inauguration of a civilian president on October 1, 1998. The
 transition process provides for a series of local, state and federal elections over a
 period of 3 years.
 By year's end, there was little meaningful progress towards democracy despite
 Abacha's 3-year transition program. The first substantial deviation from the transi-
 tion timetable occurred in June when the Government missed the deadline for cre-
 ation of new states and local governments. The timetable showed further signs of
 slippage when the Government extended to mid-September the cumbersome and im-
 practical party registration process scheduled for completion at the end of August
 (see Section 2.b.). The government body set up to screen political parties seeking
 registration had the authority to disqualify parties. The process was not subject to
 public scrutiny or review. In September CON announced the registration of five
 parties and ordered dissolved all unregistered political parties, effectively prevent-
 ing the participation of other political parties, which included the majority of estab-
 lished politicians and potential opposition leaders, in the electoral process. The re-
 viewing body also retains the option to revoke registration at any time, leaving a
 loophole for later disqualification of any parties that annoy the regime. Individual
 members of unregistered parties are theoretically permitted to join the officially reg-
 istered parties, but whether they will be permitted to run for office remains to be
 seen (see Section 2.b.). Local government elections on a party basis, originally sched-
 uled for December, were postponed until March 1997.
 In August Abacha removed all state administrators from their posts, redeploying
 three of them to new states, and returning the rest to their respective branches of
 the armed forces. Ten of the former administrators are reportedly being subjected
 to a government probe of their actions in office. At year's end, none of the adminis-
 trators had been formally charged or tried.
 Politics remained dominated by men. However, there are no legal impediments to
 political participation or voting by women or members of any minority group. There
 are three women in the Federal Executive Council and female juges and mag-
 istrates at all levels of the judiciary.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The Government permitted local human rights groups to operate but often inter-
 fered with their activities, detaining their members and preventing them from criti-
 cizing the Government's human rights record (see Sections 1.d. and 2.a.). High-level
 government officials regularly denounced the activities of Nigeria's human rights
 community, often accusing its members and the independent press of participating
 in foreign-inspired plots to destabilize the country.
 Notwithstanding the Government's hostile attitude, national and international
 human rights groups engaged in a vocal and public campaign for the promotion of
 human rights. Among the most active organizations are: The CLO, the Committee
 for the Defense of Human Rights, the Constitutional Rights Project, the National
 Association of Democratic Lawyers, Human Rights Africa, and the Legal Research
 and Resource Development Center. A number of prominent authors, artists, edu-
 cators, and jurists, in addition to professional and labor organizations spoke out fre-
 quently on human rights issues as well. Amnesty International (AI) is active, and
 the International Committee of the Red Cross has a regional office in Lagos.
 The regime established a National Human Rights Commission in June, but the
 commission lacked credibility as an independent monitoring body. By year's end the
 commission had only limited funding, no prmanent office space, no working tele-
 phones and no clear mandate to do anything other than convene meetings. Non-
 
 
 221
 governmental human rights groups did not view the commission as a serious entity,
 and members of the commission purported to represent leading NGO's were un-
 known to the grups they allegedly represented. The commission-held two meetings
 and sponsored a public lecture on Worid Human Rights Day but had no discernible
 effect on the overall human rights situation.
 The Government impeded foreign human rights monitoring groups and individ-
 uals from visiting the country by delaying or refusing visas and attempting to ma-
 nipulate their schedules. The most notable example was the United Nations fact-
 finding team dispatched in late March to examine human rights and the transition
 process. The Government first proposed a program almost entirely lacking in expo-
 sure to nongovermment groups or individuals, then attempted to prevent opposition
 groups from meeting with the team by arresting or intimidating those who sought
 meetings. There were credible reports that the Government stepped up repression
 in politically sensitive Ogoniland and surrounding areas of Rivers state just before
 the U.N. team's visit and kept the new higher levels of abuse in place after its April
 departure. In November the Government detained three AI officials, including visit-
 ing Al development field organizer for west and central Africa, for carrying "sedi-
 tious literature" which included the text of a speech by Al Secretary General Pierre
 Sane. The three were held until 10:00 p.m. and then released but told to report in
 the following day. They were required to report to officials each day for 4 days.
 Other organizations have also reported similar restrictions.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex  Religion, Language, Social Status, or
 Disability
 Both the 1979 and 1989 Constitutions provide citizens with the right to freedom
 from discrimination based on "community, place of origin, ethnic group, sex, reli-
 gion, or political opinion." However, customary and religious discrimination against
 women persists, while tension between the Government and disaffected minority
 groups prsistd.
 Women.-Reports of spousal abuse are common, especially wife beating in polygy-
 nous families. Police do not normally intervene in domestic disputes, which are sel-
 dom discussed publicly. In mre traditional areas, it is questionable whether the
 courts and police intervene to protect women who formally accuse their husbands
 if the level of alleged abuse does not exceed customary norms in the area. Purdah,
 the Islamic practice of keeping girls and women in seclusion from men outside the
 family, is prevalent in parts of the far north. Women also bear the brunt of attacks
 for social and religious reasons, particularly for "immodest" or "inappropriate" be-
 havior.
 Women experience considerable discrimination as well as physical abuse. There
 are no laws barring women from particular fields of employment, but women often
 experience discrimination because the Government tolerates customary and reli-
 gious practices that adversely affect them. Approximately 35 percent of women are
 active in the labor force. While the number of women employed in the business sec-
 tor increases every year, women do not receive equal pay for equal work and often
 find it extremely difficult to acquire commercial credit or obtain tax deductions or
 rebates as heads of households.
 While some women have made considerable individual progress, both in the aca-
 demic and business world, most are underprivileged. Although women are not le-
 gally barred from owning land, under some customary land tenure systems only
 men can own land, and women gain access to land through marriage or family. In
 addition, many customary practices do not recognize a woman's right to inherit her
 husband's property, and many widows are rendered destitute when their in-laws
 take virtually all of the deceased husband's property. In other areas, a widow is con-
 sidered part of the property, and she too may be "inherited" by the husband's eldest
 male relative. Polygyny is widely practiced among all ethnic groups in both Chris-
 tian and Islamic communities. Women often must provide permission from a male
 family member to obtain a passport (see Section 2.d.).
 Chidren.-The Government remains only sporadically committed to children's
 rightsand welfare. Public schools continue to deteriorate, and limited facilities pre-
 cluded access to education for some children. While the Government increased
 spending on children's health in recent years, it seldom enforced even the inad-
 equate laws designed to protect the rights of children. Although the law stipulates
 that "no child shall be ordered to be imprisoned," juvenile offenders are routinely
 denied bail and incarcerated along with hardened criminals.
 There are a range of problems involving children. The Government only occasion-
 ally condemns child abuse and neglect and makes little effort to stop customary
 practices, such as the sale of children into marriage. There are credible reports that
 poor families often sell their daughters into marriage as a means of supplementing
 
 
 their incomes. There are also reports that many young girls are forced into marriage
 as soon as they reach puberty, regardless of age, to prevent "indecency" associated
 with premarital sex.
 The Government publicly opposes female genital mutilation (FGM), which is wide-
 ly condemned by international health experts as damaging to both physical and psy-
 chological health. However, the Government has taken no action to abolish the pro-
 cedure, and many ethnic groups subject young females to it. Nigerian experts esti-
 mate that as many as 50 percent of women, primarily in the Christian south but
 less in the north, may have undergone FGM, which varies from simple removal of
 the clitoral hood or labia minora to excision of the clitoris and the most dangerous
 form, infibulation. A U.N. report states that 60 percent of the population, 32.7 mil-
 lion women, have been subjected to some form of FGM.
 The age at which females are subjected to FGM varies from the first week of life
 to after a woman delivers her first child. The Ministry of Health and NGO's sponsor
 public awareness and education projects to inform communities of the health haz-
 ards of FGM. The press openly condemned the practice on a number of occasions.
 People With Disabilities.:-While the Government called for private businesses to
 institute policies ensuring fair treatment for the 2 percent of the work force that
 it claims is disabled, it has not enacted any laws fostering greater accessibility to
 buildings and public transportation, nor has it formulated any policy that specifi-
 cally ensures the right of the disabled to work.
 Religious Minorities.-The law prohibits religious discrimination. Nonetheless, it
 is commonly reported that government officials often discriminate against persons
 practicing a religion different from their own. Religious tensions often lead to vio-
 lence. There were regular clashes in the fall between the Muslim Brothers, a Shiite
 group, and Sunni Muslims in Zaria in Kaduna state. Shiites reportedly stormed
 Sunni mosques in an attempt to install their own imams as preachers. More than
 20 protstrs and security personnel were killed in religion-related violence that
 began in mid-September when the Government arrested a leadier of the Shi'ite Mus-
 lim Brotherhood, Sheikh Ibrahim Al-Zakzaky (see Sections 1.d. and 2.c.). Zakzaky
 remains in detention and has not been charged with an offense.
 Nat ional /RaciallEthnic Minoritie.-The Government has promulgated no official
 policy concerning discrimination against anyof the 250 ethn.c groups, and laws do
 not favor one group over another. However there is a long history of tension among
 the diyerse ethnic groups. Clashes continued between rival ethnic gups in Delta,
 Rivers, Benue, Cross River, Kaduna, Plateau, and Taraba states, often resulting in
 casualties. Tradition continues to impose considerable pressure on individual gov-
 ernment officials to favor their own ethnic group, and ethnic favoritism persists.
 During nonpartisan local government elections in March, nonndigenous residents
 of certain states, notably Kaduna, were barred from exercising their right to vote.
 The Ogoni, an ethnic goup indigenous to Rivers state in eastrn Nigeria (one of
 the oil-producing regions), maintain that the Government continues to engage in a
 systematic campaign to deprive them of their land and its wealth. Members of the
 Ogni group claim that the Government seizes Ogni property without fair com-
 pensation, ignores the environmental impact of oil production on Ogoni land, and
 fails to provide adequate public services, such as water and electricity. The con-
 frontation between the Government and the Ogoni remains violent. MOSOP, which
 campaigns for Ogoni autonomy, often desribes government policy towards the
 Ogoni as genocide. Ogoni concerns about environmental degradation and the quality
 of social services have merit. The Ogoni 19, accused of murdering 4 goni politicians
 in July 1994, remained in detention at year's end (see Section i.e.).
 Other ethnic minorities, particularly in Delta, Rivers, and Akwa Ibom states, have
 echoed Ogoni claims of environmental degradation and government indifference to
 their development. Groups such as the Ijaw, Itsekiri, and Urhobo have grown in-
 creasingly vocal in expressing their unhappiness, while the prevalence of ethnic con-
 flict and confrontation with government forces increased in these areas.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Government continued its pattern of inter-
 ference in the affairs of organized labor through the issuance of decrees that re-
 stricted unions in the selection of leaders, directed various unions to merge, and pro-
 scribed certain unions entirely. The Government also employed a variety of tactics
 to divide and intimidate labor. Although basic labor legislation dating to 1974 re-
 mains in place, decrees enacted in 1994 that dissolved elected national executive
 councils of the Nigeria Labor Congress (NLC) and two key oil sector unions and
 placed them under the authority of government-appointed sole administrators have
 marginalized the labor movement. The Government's exercise of absolute power
 over the affairs of the NLC, the National Union of Petroleum and Natural Gas
 
 
 Workers (NUPENG), and the Petroleum and Natural Gas Senior Staff Association
 (PENGASSAN) continued, in blatant disregard of International Labor Organization
 (ILO) conventions that it has signed and ratified.
 Workers, except members of the armed forces and employees designated essential
 by the Government, may join trade unions. Essential employees include fire fighters,
 police, employees of the central bank, the security printers (printers of currency,
 passports, and government forms), and customs and excise staff. In May 1993, the
 Government promulgated the Teaching Essential Services Decree, declaring edu-
 cation an essential service. The Decree did not, however, proscribe education sector
 unions.
 Approximately 70 percent of the work force is employed in agriculture. Agricul-
 tural workers, except for small numbers in the food processing sector, are not union-
 ized. Most of the informal sector and practically all small industries and businesses
 remain nonunionized. Approximately 11.5 percent of the total work force belong to
 unions. Nonagricultural enterprises that employ more than 50 employees are
 obliged by law to recognize trade unions and to pay or deduct a dues checkoff for
 employees who are members. Organized labor has accused some employers of delib-
 erately organizing their industries into multiple units employing less than 50 work-
 ers to avoid unionization. The Government has threatened in te past to withdraw
 the dues checkoff provision and make the payment of union dues completely vol-
 untary if unions pursue strikes, as in the cases of the 1993 general strike, and the
 1994 petroleum strike.
 In contravention of the ILO Convention on Freedom of Association, the Govern-
 ment has decreed that the NLC is the single central labor body. Although state ex-
 ecutive councils of the NLC continue to function, government interference makes it
 difficult for the NLC to represent workers effectively. The NLC claims to represent
 3 million workers of a total work force of 30 million. This figure is difficult to verify
 and may have dropped in light of continued depression in te manufacturing sector
 and significant public sector reductions in force. The Government continued to resist
 attempts by higher graded workers and middle management to form and register
 an independent labor central. However, the Senior Staff Consultative Association of
 Nigeria (SESCAN) continues to serve as an unregistered labor central for the senior
 staff associations.
 The Government used threats of arrest and short-term and long-term detention
 without charge to intimidate labor activists throughout the year. NUPENG Presi-
 dent Wariebe Agamene and two other labor leaders were released from detention
 over the 1996 New Year holiday, but the Government continued to hold without
 charge NUPENG General Secretary Frank Kokori, detained since August 1994 and
 former PENGASSAN General Secretary and current Secretary General of SESCAN,
 Milton Dabibi, detained since January. In March a special assistant to the Minister
 of Labor and Productivity quit his employment claiming that the Minister was plan-
 ning to arrest and probe union leaders for alleged financial wrongdoing. In May pro-
 testers who claimed to support government positions on controversial labor issues
 disrupted a meeting of union activists in Ogun state. The following day, the authori-
 ties arrested Adams Oshiomhole, General Secretary of the Textile Workers Union,
 and held him 26 hours for questioning. A similar meeting held at the University
 of Lagos in September was disrupted by violence from progovernment supporters.
 The Government demonstrated its indifference to the ILO Convention on Freedom
 of Association when it issued Decree Four, Trade Union (amendment) Decree. Dated
 January 5, but only released in late February, the decree reduced the number of
 industrial trade unions from 41 to 29 through directed mergers, barred general sec-
 retaries from seeking elective positions in the NLC or in the unions that employed
 them, directed employers to act as dues collecting agents of the NLC, and included
 an ouster clause to bar judicial challenges to the decree. While the merger exercise
 was accomplished without much rancor, the Minister of Labor was publicly accused
 of attempting to manipulate several elections of new union executive councils, and
 union activists, led by the general secretaries of key unions, rallied on several occa-
 sions to condemn government interference in trade union activities. Eventually, in
 June a delegation of union activists presented labor views directly to the Head of
 State, but at year's end the decree has not been amended or withdrawn.
 Despite promises made by government spokesmen at the ILO Conference in June
 1995 that elected executive councils would replace sole administrators at the NLC,
 NUPENG, and PENGASSAN, the Government took no credible steps to hold such
 elections. The unwillingness of the Government to allow elections to proceed at the
 two oil workers unions was clear evidence of the Government's overall lack of sincer-
 ity on the issue. At the 1996 Conference, the Government disingenuously blamed
 workers for obstructing elections and promised again that sole administrators would
 be removed from the three bodies. The promise remained unfulfilled at year's end.

 The Government further violated the freedom of association of workers when it
 proscribed three campus unions on Augst 21. It dissolved the Academic Staff
 union of Universities (ASUU), which had been on a nationwide strike since April,
 plus two nonstriking unions-the Nonacademic Staff Union (NASU) and the Senior
 Staff Association of Nigerian Universities (SSANU)-and seized their assets. In the
 aftermath of the proscription order, the Government ordered all academics who
 wanted to keep their positions to return to work. After 6 months, the strikers re-
 turned to work.
 For the third year in succession, the ILO faulted Nigeria for its disregard of work-
 er rights and its violation of Convention 87. In 1995 a "special paragraph" took the
 Government to task for denying trade unions the right to elect their leaders freely
 and supplemented a 1994 finding of the ILO Committee on Freedom of Association
 that the Government's interference in the administration of labor unions and its re-
 striction of worker rights directly contravened ratified conventions. The Committee
 had recommended that the Government remove appointed administrators from labor
 bodies, restore suspended union executives, allow them access to the premises of
 union headquarters, and restore dues checkoff where suspended. By year's end,
 none of these demands had been met. Once again the Committee on the Application
 of Conventions and Recommendations adopted a "special paragraph". The Govern-
 ment took advantage of a predetermined rotation among African states to take a
 seat on the ILO governing body, but withdrew a bid for chairmanship of the Tech-
 nical Cooperation Committee after repeated criticism of its continuedcon   or
 ILO recommendations.
 The right to strike is recognized by law except for those performing essential serv-
 ices. However, workers are required to give 21 days' notice prior to commencing a
 strike. Strikes in the public sector occurred in many of the 30 states, typically when
 underfunded state and local governments failed to fulfill previously negotiated con-
 tract prvisions relating to salaries and allowances. The National Association of
 Resident Doctors struck several times over wage-related concerns.
 There are no laws prohibiting retribution against strikers and strike leaders, but
 strikers who believe that they experience unfair retribution may submit their cases
 to the Industrial Arbitration Panel whose decisions are binding on all parties.
 In August 1991, under Decree 32, the Government revoked past policy and per-
 mittd international labor afitliation with non-AMrican international lab or organiza-
 tions. Negotiations commenced with the International Confederation of Free Trade
 Unions (iCFTU) for formal affiliation, but the removal of the NLC executive and the
 protractd political confrontation precluded further progress on these applications.
 Following a December 1995 ICTUrolution critical of the Government's labor
 policies and actions, the Government refused to permit the ICFTU to send a delega-
 tion, although a representative of an ICFTUJ-affiiated African labor organization
 was allowed to visit for several days in May.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bar aw Collectively.-The labor laws provide for
 both the right to orke  and the rig t to bargain collectively between management
 and trade unions. ollective bargaining is, in fact, common in many sectors of the
 economy. Laws further protect workers against retaliation by employers for labor ac-
 tivity through an independent arm of the judiciary, the Nigerian Industrial Court
 (NIC), which bandies complaints of antiunion discrimination. Before cases can be
 brought to the NIC, parties are required to seek mediation and conciliation through
 the Ministry of Labor. Unresolved disputes may subsequently be taken to the Indus-
 trial Arbitration Panel and the NIC. Union officials have, however, questioned the
 indepndence of the NIC in light of its refusal to resolve various disputes stemming
 from the Government's failure to fulfill contract provisions for public employees.
 There have been no significant reforms in labor practice since January 1991,
 when the Government abolished the uniform wage structure for all government en-
 tities. This move allowed each tier of government--federal, state, local, and state en-
 terprises-freedom to negotiate its own level of wages, benefits, and conditions of
 employment. As a result, negotiations previously conducted on a nationwide basis
 under the direct supervision of the Labor Ministry are now conducted on a local,
 often plant-wide, basis with less government involvement.
 One export processing zone remains in development in Calabar, Cross River state.
 Workers in such zones are subject to national labor laws.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The 1974 Labor Decree and the
 1979 and 1989 Constitutions prohibit forced or compulsory labor. There are no re-
 ports of forced or compulsory labor. However, the ILO has noted that with no con-
 stitution in force, the Government may be unable to enforce the ILO Convention
 against forced labor.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Chitldren.-The 1974 Labor Decree prohibits
 employment of children under 18 years of age in commerce and industry and re-
 
 
 225
 stricts other child labor to home-based agricultural or domestic work. The law fur-
 ther stipulates that children may not be employed in agricultural or domestic work
 for more than 8 hours per day. The decree allows the apprenticeship of youths at
 age 13 under specific conditions.
 Prima    education is compulsory, although this is rarely enforced, and recent
 studies  low declining enrollment due mainly to the continuing deterioration of
 public schools. This lack of sufficient primary school infrastructure has ended some
 families' access to education, forcing them to place their children in the labor mar-
 ket. The ILO and the United Nations Children's Fund, in consultation with the
 NLC, have concluded that child labor, while not yet endemic, is increasing and could
 become a serious problem.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The 1974 Labor Decree sets a minimum wage,
 which is reviewed on an ad hoc basis. The last review in 1991 was undertaken by
 a tripartite group consisting of representatives of the NLC, the Nigeria Employers'
 Consultative Association, and the Ministry of Labor. With the considerable decline
 in the naira, the group raised the minimum wage from $2.90 (250 naira) to $5.00
 (450 naira) per month, a level which does not provide a decent living for a worker
 and family.
 The 1974 Labor Decree also established a 40-hour workweek, prescribed 2 to 4
 weeks of annual leave, and stipulated that workers must be paid extra for hours
 worked over the legal limit. The decree also stated that workers who work on Sun-
 days and statutory public holidays must be paid a full day's pay in addition to their
 normal wages. There is no law prohibiting excessive compulsory overtime.
 The Labor Decree contains general health and safety previsions, some aimed spe-
 cifically at young or female workers. While it requires t at the factory inspectorate
 of the Ministry of Labor and Employment inspect factories for compliance with
 health and safety standards, this agency neglects safety oversight of construction
 sites and other nonfactory work. The decree also requires employers to compensate
 injured workers and dependent survivors of those killed in industrial accidents. The
 Labor Decree does not provide workers with the right to remove themselves from
 dangerous work situations without loss of employment. The Labor Ministry, which
 is charged with enforcement of these laws, has experienced large staff turnover and
 has been largely ineffective in identifying violations. The Government has failed to
 act on various ILO recommendations since 1991 to update its moribund inspection
 and accident reporting program.
