 CAMEROON
 Political power in Cameroon is concentrated in the Presidency
 and a single party, the Cameroon People's Democratic Movement
 (CPDM). President Paul Biya is Head of State and head of the
 CPDM. The President makes all major decisions and appoints
 all Government and party officials. In the past, the National
 Assembly did not initiate bills and usually approved without
 significant change any measure proposed by the Government. In
 1990, however, the Assembly substantively amended several
 pieces of draft legislation affecting human rights.
 Cameroon's political system is influenced by its ethnic and
 linguistic diversity, which includes 230 languages and major
 dialects and three separate European colonial traditions
 (German, French, and British). French and English are
 official languages. A careful balancing act among the various
 groups within the Government and party is required to maintain
 political cohesion, and this acts as a check on government
 power.
 Internal security responsibilities are shared by the National
 Police (Surete Nationale), the national intelligence service
 (CENER), the Gendarmerie, the Ministry of Territorial
 Administraion Military Intelligence (SEMIL) and, to a lesser
 extent, the Presidential Security Service. The Ministry of
 Territorial Administraion (MINAT) is in charge of prisons, and
 its local-level officials (prefects) play a key role in
 ensuring order. The-National Police have the dominant role in
 enforcing internal security laws. There continue to be
 credible reports of human rights abuses committed by security
 forces.
 Cameroon's per capita gross domestic product (GDP) of about
 $1,010 in 1988 placed it among the middle-income developing
 countries. A rise in oil prices in 1990 helped offset to a
 limited degree continued depression in the coffee and cocoa
 markets, but preliminary data indicated there was no GDP
 growth in 1990. Cameroon's-diversified agricultural base,
 food self-sufficiency, and government policies aimed at
 promoting food exports and private-sector growth help mitigate
 the effects of declining terms of trade and other external
 difficulties.
 Human rights remained circumscribed in 1990, but there was
 progress after midyear toward a more open political system.
 In April the Government arrested and tried for subversion 10
 persons who were attempting to form a political party, In May
 government forces killed at least six persons following a
 rally in support of an unauthorized party. International
 outrage and mounting domestic pressure led President Biya to
 announce major reforms in a June 28 speech to the ruling
 CPMD. Soon thereafter, the independent press became
 increasingly outspoken and the official media less sycophantic
 as censorship all but disappeared. This auspicious trend
 toward freer expression halted abruptly with the appointment
 of a new Minister of Territorial Administration in September.
 However, laws restricting freedom of movement were
 liberalized, and, at year's end, President Biya signed several
 measures designed to open the political process, including a
 law laying down a framework for multiparty democracy.
 Although a new law governing the media was enacted, stiff
 censorship provisions leave wide open the question of how free
 the press will be. Also, in 1990 the Government released over
 150 persons detained in connection with a 1984 coup attempt
 and several others convicted of subversion earlier in the
 
 
 CAMEROON
 year. Continuing human rights concerns include the abuse of
 prisoners, harsh prison conditions, arbitrary arrest and
 detention, restrictions on freedoms of speech and assembly,
 women's and worker rights, and the extent to which the new
 legislation will truly permit citizens to change their
 government through democratic means.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 Several instances of extrajudicial killing were reported.
 During the Douala Ten trial (see Section l.e.), one of the
 defense lawyers, Pierre Mbobda, was shot and killed. Although
 public opinion at the time held political motives responsible
 for the killing, an investigation found no evidence to support
 that assumption. Reliable, informed sources believe the
 accused killer, an off-duty policeman, acted from personal
 motives.
 At least six persons were killed when a unit of the
 Gendarmerie opened fire following a rally in Bamenda on May 26
 in support of an unauthorized political party. The official
 government position is that those who died were trampled to
 death by panicked fellow demonstrators. The Government did,
 however, permit the independent press to report the other
 version. There were persistent reports from usually reliable
 sources that security forces killed two students following a
 demonstration the same day at the University of Yaounde. The
 Government categorically denied the allegation, and no one has
 emerged with names or other details.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reports of disapearance during 1990.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Although the Penal Code proscribes torture, renders
 inadmissible in court evidence obtained thereby, and prohibits
 public servants from using force against any person, there
 were credible reports of severe beatings and torture of
 persons in custody during 1990. Two Douala Ten defendants
 (see Section i.e.), Anicet Ekani and Henriette Ekwe, saic in
 court that they had been subjected to inhuman treatment. The
 prosecutor did not rebut either claim. Ms. Ekwe said her legs
 had been stretched until she agreed to sign a statement, an
 asertion the court did not address specifically when it ruled
 that "irregularities" in the obtaining of some evidence did
 not render it inadmissible.  Dominique Djeukam Tchameni,
 convicted of subversion in March and granted amnesty in
 August, announced in an interview carried on government-owned
 television that he had been tortured after his arrest in 1988.
 Camille Mboua-Massock, a political maverick who had announced
 plans to hold a public rally in support of President Biya's
 reform plans, was reportedly held for a week, during which
 time he was given no food and very little water.
 There were numerous credible reports that security forces
 searching for participants in a May 26 demonstration at the
 
 
 44
 CAMEROON
 University of Yaounde severely beat several students and raped
 at least one woman. Eyewitness reports indicated that
 English-speaking Cameroonians (Anglophones) had been subjected
 to arbitrary arrest and such inhuman conditions of detention
 as being suspended by their wrists. In order to restore
 public faith in the police force, in August the chief of the
 National Police created an internal affairs unit responsible
 for combating police abuses against the public. At year's
 end, the special brigade had yet to prosecute any officials
 committing human rights abuses.
 In March Amnesty International (AI) appealed to the Government
 to investigate reports that two prisoners had been tortured to
 death. As far as was known, no investigation took place
 during 1990. Officials who treat prisoners inhumanely are
 rarely, if ever, punished.
 Harsh prison conditions are the rule. Most prisons are
 severely overcrowded, notably Nkandengui Prison in Yaounde,
 and disease is rampant. Tuberculosis and skin diseases are
 particularly common. Prisoners suffer from serious
 malnutrition unless provided food by friends or family.
 Although many of those imprisoned as a result of the 1984 coup
 attempt were released (see Section l.d.), most of the
 estimated 70 to 100 still incarcerated are reportedly ill.
 Reliable sources report that at least 25 of the estimated 350
 prisoners held in connection with the 1984 coup attempt died
 while in custody between 1984 and 1990. Ministry of Justice
 officials in 1990 began an effort to reduce overcrowding by
 bringing detainees to trial more rapidly but did not release
 minor offenders or those serving short terms. The Government
 indicated that financial difficulties precluded construction
 of new prisons in 1990.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Arbitrary, prolonged detention remains a serious problem.
 Under Cameroonian law, a person arrested on suspicion of
 having committed a nonpolitical offense may be held in custody
 up to 24 hours before being charged. The period of custody
 may be renewed up to three times with the express agreement of
 the Attorney-General. However, after an investigating
 magistrate has determined that the case should be brought to
 trial and has issued a warrant to that effect, there is no
 limitation on how long the detainee may be held in "preventive
 detention" pending trial.
 Accused persons awaiting trial constitute the majority of
 persons in Yaounde and Douala prisons. Release on bail is
 permitted by law only in the Anglophone provinces, whose legal
 system retains features of British common law. Even there,
 bail is granted infrequently.
 There have been instances of local or provincial authorities
 ordering the continued detention of persons even after a court
 ordered their release. CENER and SEMIL do not implement fully
 the Penal Code requirement that detainees be brought before a
 magistrate for investigation of possible offenses and have
 held detainees incommunicado. Persons may also be held in
 .administrative detention" under legislation pertaining to
 subversion. The Penal Code defines administrative detention
 as "the loss of liberty for a political felony or
 misdemeanor " Such detention by regional authorities is
 initially for 1 month, renewable twice, and may be extended up
 to an additional 6 months by the Minister of Territorial
 
 
 CAMEROON
 Administration. Those placed in administrative detention do
 not disappear; their families are told where they are, though
 not always promptly. They are released eventually, though the
 detention may be lengthy, in some cases exceeding the
 theoretical maximum of 9 months.
 State of Emergency provisions, invoked following the 1984 coup
 attempt, were allowed to lapse in 1989. There is, therefore,
 no longer a legal basis for unlimited administrative
 detention. However, even in the absence of proper authority,
 some administrative authorities continue to order persons
 detained for indefinite periods. Senior officials state that
 they are working to ensure that officials who once had
 delegated authority to order such detention are made aware of
 the changed circumstances. A new law governing states of
 emergency explicitly defines the circumstances under which the
 President can declare an emergency and limits the number of
 times the President may renew the declaration. At the same
 time, however, the new law grants administrative authorities
 substantial arbitrary powers during such an emergency.
 Dominique Djeukam Tchameni, a civilian who was held for almost
 18 months before being charged with subversion, was convicted
 in March by the Yaounde Military Tribunal. He was sentenced
 to 3 years in prison but received presidential amnesty in
 August and was released. Many of the persons implicated in
 the 1984 coup attempt, who had been held past the expiration
 of their sentences or who had been detained indefinitely in
 spite of either having been acquitted or never having been
 tried, were released in 1990 as the result of a presidential
 decree issued in April. Although Cameroonian authorities have
 yet to publish a list of those released, it is estimated that
 more than 170 persons have thus far benefited from the
 decree. However, reliable sources state that not all persons
 illegally detained as- a result of the 1984 coup attempt have
 been released. Estimates of the number still in detention
 range from 8 to 20.
 Persons detained are not normally permitted access to an
 attorney (see Section i.e.) unless and until charges are
 brought. Until mid-1990, persons were frequently detained for
 having publicly expressed views differing from those of the
 Government or for having reported news which might be
 embarrassing to the Government. A case .in point, reported in
 detail by the human rights organization Africa Watch, was the
 detention of several journalists following demonstrations in
 May in support of political pluralism. Typically, a detainee
 is released after about 7 days. In the rare cases when
 charges are brought, they are usually for subversion. Use of
 this practice had diminished by late 1990 but had not ended.
 Cameroon does not engage in the practice of forced exile.
 Early in his first term, President Biya publicly encouraged
 all those living abroad for political reasons to return to
 Cameroon without fear of reprisal.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The Cameroonian court system is subordinate to the Ministry of
 Justice. Thus, it is part of the executive, not a separate or
 independent branch of government. Magistrates in Cameroon are
 career civil servants responsible to the Minister of Justice,
 and they are subject, particularly in political cases, to
 government direction. Their decisions in nonpolitical cases
 are not usually subject to government interference, and they
 
 
 CAMEROON
 generally are considered to conduct fair trials. The Minister
 of Justice has publicly cautioned magistrates against awarding
 "excessive" damages against the State, and there have been
 reported cases of the Government refusing to pay damages when
 a court has found against it.
 Trial by a presiding magistrate is provided for in law, and
 this practice is followed except in the case of persons held
 under administrative detention or State of Emergency
 regulations. Public trials are guaranteed by law, although
 exceptions are allowed for the public good or for national
 security reasons. Defendants in felony cases are provided
 attorneys if they cannot afford to engage their own, and there
 is a right to appeal.
 Until the end of 1990, when the law establishing the State
 Security Court was promulgated, civilians accused of
 subversion or weapons offenses were tried by a military
 tribunal, the same body which has jurisdiction over offenses
 committed by members of the military. Each tribunal has three
 members, and its presiding officer must be a magistrate. As
 in felony cases tried in the regular court system, defendants
 are entitled to counsel. Appeals, however, are rare and, in
 the case of subversion verdicts, precluded. Impartial
 observers agree that the "Douala Ten," a group of Cameroonians
 pressing for more rapid political change, were not accorded a
 fair trial by the Yaounde Military Tribunal. Arrested on
 subversion and libel charges based on questionable warrants,
 their actual offense appears to have been an attempt to
 organize a political party. The trial was marred by an
 admission of improperly obtained evidence and the tribunal's
 failure to consider constitutional questions raised by the
 defense. Of the four defendants present who were convicted in
 the April trial, only two were sent to prison, and they were
 released in August as the result of a presidential amnesty.
 Traditional courts continue to play an important role in
 Cameroon, particularly in rural areas. Their authority varies
 by region and by ethnic group, but they are often the arbiters
 of property and domestic disputes and may serve a probate
 function as well. Most systems permit appeal of
 first-instance decisions to traditional authorities of higher
 rank.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 While both invasions of the home and tampering with
 correspondence are violations of Cameroonian law, there have
 been frequent reports of police harassing citizens and
 entering homes without warrants during periodic searches for
 criminals. Following neighborhood searches in Bamenda and
 Yaounde in late May, there were numerous credible reports of
 arbitrary searches. In Bamenda, particularly, house-to-house
 searches were common, and there were several reports that
 members of security services raped local women. Police
 officials also sometimes enter homes and demand to see
 receipts for household property as a customs law enforcement
 measure. Surveillance of suspected dissidents and the
 monitoring of their mail and telephone conversations are
 common practices.

 CAMEROON
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Although the Constitution of 1972 provides for freedom of
 expression and of the press, Cameroonian law and practice have
 long restricted these freedoms. However, there was progress
 in relaxing these restrictions in 1990.
 Formal censorship of the press had nearly disappeared by
 September, although newspaper publishers were still obliged to
 submit copy to administrative authorities for review. When
 Gilbert Andze Tsoungui was named Minister of Territorial
 Administration in August, he restored the practice of
 aggressive and pervasive censorship and seizures. Newspapers
 were told not to print some stories alleging official
 misconduct, and authorities banned or delayed local
 distribution of several issues of respected international
 publications, such as Le Monde and Jeune Afrique. The
 Government contends the press should be free but not
 "irresponsible." What constitutes a "responsible" press was
 the subject of much debate as 1990 drew to a close.
 The new law on mass communication, promulgated in December,
 provides a more liberal framework for the establishment of
 media organs, including broadcast facilities. However, it
 also permits censorship "where there is a conflict with the
 principles of public policy." While censorship decisions may
 be appealed, the competent court is not obliged to rule until
 1 month has elapsed-with obvious ramifications for
 time-sensitive media.
 The Government publishes two official newspapers, the English
 and French editions of the Cameroon Tribune, and controls
 radio (the most important medium) and television. Most
 official journalists are civil servants who may be transferred
 to less desirable positions if they do not practice
 self-censorship. A large group of Anglophone broadcast
 journalists was suspended in early May following an debate on
 the air on the merits of greater political pluralism. The
 journalists and other participants were also detained from 24
 to 48 hours.
 The risk of being detained for pursuing stories critical of
 the Government declined markedly in the latter part of the
 year but remains a problem. Journalists, long used to
 self-censorship, began to explore the limits of official
 tolerance. Long-taboo subjects, such as official malfeasance
 and allegations of miscarriages of justice, began to appear,
 especially in the newly resurgent independent press.
 There are no restrictions on academic freedom, though it is
 generally believed that CENER informants pervade the campus of
 the University of Yaounde. There remain restrictions on some
 other forms of public speech (see Section l.c.).
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Freedom of assembly and association are provided for in the
 Constitution but are restricted in law and practice. A new
 law promulgated toward the end of 1990 liberalized
 Cameroonians' ability to form private associations. The Penal
 Code prohibits public meetings, demonstrations, or processions
 without prior government approval. While. permits are almost
 never denied, neither are they issued. Large public meetings
 
 
 CAMEROON
 in which the Government or ruling party plays no role are
 virtually unknown.
 When organizers of the Social Democratic Front (SDF) sought
 permission to hold a rally in late May, authorities never
 specifically refused, choosing instead to ban all public
 gatherings. Another tactic administrative authorities have
 used is to pressure the organizer into canceling the planned
 event and putting him into detention if he refuses to
 acquiesce as, for example, in the case of Mboua Massock (see
 Section l.c.).
 Organizations, including religious congregations, must
 register with the Government. Throughout 1990, any form of
 political organization other than the CPDM was prohibited from
 functioning effectively, though the SDF carried out some
 low-level organizing late in the year. President Biya
 promulgated a new law in December which provides a framework
 for the organization and operation of political parties. The
 new law establishes objective criteria that parties must meet
 if they are to be authorized and also requires that
 administrative authorities respond in writing within 3 months
 to requests to organize parties. There are few restrictions
 on how parties may organize, but appeals to tribalism and
 programs that call national unity and "national integration"
 into question are among proscribed activities.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Cameroon is a secular state. There is no established
 religion. Roughly 25 percent of Cameroonians are Muslims, 40
 percent are Christians, and the rest follow traditional
 beliefs. Some blend elements of Christianity with traditional
 practices. Officials of the Government and the CPDM include
 members of all three groups. Freedom of religion is provided
 for in the Constitution, but a religious group must be
 approved and registered with the Ministry of Territorial
 Administration in order to exist and function legally. There
 have been instances in the past of a small group's application
 being rejected on the grounds that it was too nearly identical
 to an existing group. The Jehovah's Witnesses were banned in
 1970 and have been periodic targets of harassment since that
 time. However, government authorities stated that Witnesses
 could expect this harassment to cease once legislation on
 public liberties was enacted. These laws entered into force
 in late December, but it was too early to determine their
 effect upon the religious freedom of Witnesses. While there
 have been isolated incidents of religious intolerance, the
 Government discourages such acts, and most Cameroonians are
 proud of their tradition of religious harmony.
 The Government does not discourage the practice of traditional
 religions. Acts of witchcraft, divination, or magic "liable
 to disrupt public order or tranquility, or to harm persons or
 property" are outlawed, with potential penalties of up to 10
 years' imprisonment. Missionaries played a major role in the
 development of Cameroon and continue to be active. Foreign
 clergy suffer no ill-treatment. There dre no particular
 restrictions on places of worship, the training of clergy,
 religious education, or participation in charitable
 activities. Conversions are common. Independent Christian and
 Muslim publications exist in Cameroon, and there is no
 evidence they are more heavily censored than is the secular
 press.
 
 
 CAMEROON
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Freedom of movement within the country is not restricted by
 law. Police occasionally stop travelers to check
 identification documents, vehicle registrations, and tax
 receipts as a security and immigration control measure, but
 the checks are not normally pervasive or oppressive. The
 requirement for Cameroonians and foreigners married to
 Cameroonians to obtain exit visas before departing the country
 was abolished in August, though some other resident foreigners
 are still subject to the requirement. As many as 10 percent
 of Cameroonian residents claim Nigerian nationality; they and
 nationals of some other African states are accorded free
 movement on the basis of national identity cards in lieu of
 passports.
 The Government has been known to refuse issuance of a passport
 or to confiscate a passport in order to control someone it
 considers a real or potential threat. SDF Secretary-General
 Zacharias Siga Asanga had his passport seized and was detained
 briefly under humiliating conditions in what SDF supporters
 claim was a government attempt to intimidate potential
 members. There are no restrictions on voluntary repatriation,
 and there is no forced resettlement. Foreigners' entry into
 Cameroon was also eased as a result of the August decree.
 Over the years, Cameroon has served as a safe haven for
 thousands of displaced persons and refugees. Approximately
 35,000 refugees remain in Cameroon, the majority of them
 Chadian. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees
 (UNHCR) recognizes about 3,500, most of them Chadian or
 Namibian. Following the fall of the Habre regime in December,
 about 3,000 new Chadian refugees were residing in temporary
 camps in northern Cameroon pending UNHCR recognition
 proceedings and location of a longer-term site. A large
 contingent of those who had fled Habre years before was
 planning to return to Chad atthe end of 1990. Though
 Cameroon occasionally returns illegal Chadian immigrants,
 there were no reports of forced repatriation of recognized
 refugees in 1990.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Major legal changes effected late in the year, if fully
 implemented, would permit a return to the multiparty system
 abandoned in 1966. However, at the end of 1990, Cameroon
 continued to be a one-party state with political power and
 administrative authority concentrated in the Presidency. The
 President appoints all cabinet members, governors, and
 prefects. President Biya succeeded constitutionally to the
 office of president upon the resignation of his predecessor,
 the late Ahmadou Ahidjo, and was elected unopposed in 1984 and
 1988.
 While the Constitution does not explicitly exclude the
 existence of other political parties, only the CPDM was
 permitted to have a legal existence at the end of 1990.
 Membership in the CPDM is open to all religious and ethnic
 groups and is strongly encouraged. -During 1990, at least two
 political parties sought legal recognition, and other groups
 stated their intention to do so. While permission was never
 formally denied, authorities resorted to intimidation and
 force to prevent these nascent organizations from
 
 
 50
 CAMEROON
 functioning. Opposition groups in exile, including various
 factions of the long-banned Union of Cameroonian Peoples
 (UPC), periodically send letters or pamphlets into the country
 or are heard on foreign radio broadcasts. Representatives of
 four such groups in mid-1990 announced formation of the
 umbrella Cameroon Democratic Front (FDC). Some former UPC
 members are now active in the CPDM.
 International and domestic pressure to open the political
 system increased during 1990 and became particularly intense
 following the Douala Ten trial in April and the killing of SDF
 supporters in May. At the same time, continued stagnation in
 the economy led many Cameroonians to seek redress of economic
 problems through changes in the political system. The
 Government responded to this pressure in December 1990 by
 enacting a new law setting the ground rules for a multiparty
 system
 All members of the 180-seat National Assembly were members of
 the CPDM at the end of 1990, although new legislation foresees
 members of other parties joining the Assembly as Cameroon
 institutes a multiparty system. The next legislative
 elections are not required until 1993. Voting is by universal
 adult suffrage and secret ballot. The 1988 elections took
 place with few irregularities and no allegations of fraud.
 Until recently, debate in the National Assembly had remained
 within narrow, usually technical bounds. During the June
 session, a controversial bill provoked sharper than usual
 debate. The November session saw spirited debate on several
 issues, sharp questions put to ministers, and major
 substantive amendments made to bills submitted by the
 Government. However, members of the National Assembly
 continue to feel compelled not to reject goverment proposals
 outright.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 There are no internal governmental or independent human rights
 organizations; however, the Bar Association has on occasion
 discussed human rights concerns with government officials. In
 late 1990 President Biya issued a decree setting up a
 "National Human Rights Committee." The President will name
 committee members to fixed 5-year terms, and the Committee is
 to enjoy "financial and legal independence" from the
 Government. As of year's end, committee members had not yet
 been named. The Government does not usually respond publicly
 or privately to inquiries from any human rights organization.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language or Social Status
 Access to the Government's social programs is open to all
 Cameroonian citizens on a nondiscriminatory basis. President
 Biya has repeatedly stressed publicly the dangers of
 tribalism, but there remains deep-seated suspicion among
 ethnic groups to which government officials are not immune.
 Cameroon is officially bilingual, but Anglophones are a
 distinct minority (20 percent) and often charge that the
 majority Francophones discriminate against them by denying
 them economic opportunity and a share of real political power
 commensurate with their numbers. The Francophone Bamileke,
 the country's largest single ethnic group (between 15 and 20
 percent of the population), level similar charges against the
 
 
 CAMEROON
 rest of the body politic. In the aftermath of the May
 demonstrations in Bamenda and Yaounde, a senior official of
 both the Government and the CPDM referred to Anglophones as
 the enemy in the Cameroonian house, and the government-owned
 Cameroon Tribune printed fabrications that students
 demonstrating at the University of Yaounde had sung the
 Nigerian national anthem as they marched, characterizing the
 alleged singing as "high treason." While subsequent articles
 and statements by government officials were milder, the
 initial remarks were neither retracted nor renounced.
 Meanwhile, security forces in various places throughout the
 country reportedly targeted Nigerians and Anglophone
 Cameroonians for harassment.
 Women are granted equal rights under the Constitution, and
 some are politically active in the party and the sole labor
 federation. However, significant cultural pressure is brought
 to bear on women to remain subservient to men. In early 1990,
 the Minister of Social and Women's Affairs called for the
 repeal of the statute requiring a married woman to obtain her
 husband's permission before traveling outside the country.
 New travel regulations announced in August eliminated the need
 for a woman to have this permission before obtaining a
 passport or traveling abroad. Though part of a larger package
 of reforms, this change was apparently a response to demands
 for equal treatment of women. Polygamy is permitted by law
 and tradition, but polyandry is not. The extent to which a
 woman may inherit from her husband is normally governed by
 customary law in the absence of a will, and traditions vary
 from group to group.
 In many traditional societies, custom grants greater authority
 and benefits to male than to female heirs. The percentage of
 female secondary school students increased 45 percent between
 1970 and 1986. Girls made up 45.7 percent of primary school
 pupils in 1986, but their percentage drops to 38.3 percent at
 the secondary level. Women are also disadvantaged in access
 to higher education (14 percent of students) and professional
 opportunities. Regional differences in access to education
 continue to exist, though progress toward reducing them has
 been made in recent years.
 Hospital reports of admissions of battered women in recent
 years indicate declining violence against women, at least in
 urban areas. While there are no reliable statistics on the
 extent to which such violence occurs, newspaper articles and
 letters to the editor indicate widespread acceptance of the
 practice. In crimes of passion, men are sometimes treated
 lightly by the courts. Violence directed against women in
 other than a domestic context is not a major problem. Female
 circumcision is not common in Cameroon. It is practiced by a
 limited number of traditional Muslim families and is almost
 unheard of in other groups. There is no evidence of "dowry
 deaths."
 Interest in the formation of women's rights groups is gr6wing,
 but they are not yet a major force in Cameroonian national
 life. The women's wing of the CPDM has developed programs to
 encourage the economic and social productivity of Cameroonian
 women. In April the CPDM constitution was modified to allow
 women to be elected as executive members, although no women
 were elected as officers of the party. But the measure may
 prove to be counterproductive if the dynamic women's wing of
 the party is weakened by a migration of influential women from
 the women's wing to the more powerful CPDM  Four women were
 
 
 CAMEROON
 elected to the Central Committee (among the 50 at large
 members) and women hold some other positions in the party. On
 the other hand, over the past 5 years, the number of women
 ministers and secretaries of state has dropped from four to
 one. Progress toward more equal representation in the ruling
 party is being made, but slowly.
 Women have met fewer obstacles in entering the modern wage
 sector, but few are in leadership positions.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 The Labor Code recognizes the right of workers to establish
 trade unions without prior authorization and to join trade
 unions of their choosing. In practice, however, Cameroonians
 are not free to form and join unions of their own choosing,
 since there is only one umbrella organization in the country,
 the Organization of United Cameroonian Workers (OSTC). It
 operates parallel to the CPDM, and trade unions in the country
 are subordinate to the OSTC. It is not clear to what extent
 the new law on freedom of association may open the door to
 independent unions. The top union leadership is nominated by
 the Government. The OSTC permitted multiple candidates to run
 in worker delegate elections in late 1987 and early 1988, but
 it retains the right to approve candidacies, thus assuring
 political orthodoxy. The OSTC does not play a major role in
 Cameroonian politics, although it has a membership of
 approximately 450,000 in a working population of more than 3
 million. It seeks to explain government policies to workers,
 pursues grievances, and seeks improvements in government
 programs for worker safety and training. Civil servants are
 not permitted to join unions.
 Strikes are illegal, and political activity by trade unions,
 except for action designed to protect economic and other
 interests, is prohibited. Strikes do occur, however, though
 they are usually directed at single enterprises and seldom
 last more than a few days. The OSTC is a member of the
 Organization of African Trade Union Unity. The OSTC maintains
 contact with foreign trade union organizations, including the
 American Federation of Labor-Congress of Industrial
 Organizations, but such contact requires government
 authorization.
 The International Labor Organization's (ILO) Committee of
 Experts noted in 1989 that various legislative provisions,
 which regulate the right of public servants to organize,
 restrict their right to strike, and ban foreign workers from
 trade union office, are inconsistent with ILO Convention 87 on
 freedom of association.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 Although the Labor Code recognizes the right of trade unions
 or trade union federations to engage in collective bargaining
 with employers or groups of employers, true collective
 bargaining between employers and workers is rare, owing to the
 small size of the modern industrial sector, the small number
 of large employers, and the involvement of the Government in
 the process. Under the law, all employers of more than 10
 workers must permit the election of a worker representative
 from among the employees. This worker representative has a
 statutory right to discuss labor conditions with the employer

 on behalf of the employees and enjoys special protection from
 arbitrary dismissal. Candidates for these positions must be
 approved by the OSTC.
 Minimum wage rates are determined by a complex formula which
 takes into account geographic location, education, experience,
 and profession. The Ministry of Labor is responsible for
 making the necessary calculations.
 There are no export processing zones in Cameroon, but one is
 in the formative stages. Legislation enacted to govern
 operations within such zones places no additional restrictions
 on unions, and employers are required to respect ILO
 conventions.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Forced labor is prohibited by the Labor Code. In respect of
 Cameroonian compliance with conventions prohibiting forced
 labor, the ILO's Committee on the Application of Standards in
 1990 took note of the dissolution of the National Civic
 Service (mandatory national service by university graduates)
 but remarked that the Government had made no concrete
 commitments in respect of the Committee's concerns on prison
 labor. The Committee also sought further explanation
 regarding the use of unpaid communal labor for municipal
 projects. There have been reports of communal labor being
 employed in some traditional societies.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 The Labor Code sets the minimum working age at 14, a rule that
 appears to be respected and enforced in the modern wage
 sector. Inspectors from the Ministry of Labor are empowered to
 enforce provisions of Cameroon's Labor Code, as are labor
 courts. In rural areas where farming occupies 80 percent of
 Cameroon's citizens, children.'participate at early ages in
 agricultural work alongside adults. In addition, young
 relatives, especially girls from rural areas, are often
 employed in the household as domestics. Street vendors in
 urban areas are occasionally under age 14.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 Under the labor code, the minimum annual paid vacation is 18
 days, and the legal workweek ranges from 40 hours for
 nonagricultural employees to 56 hours per week for security
 guards. In order to make room for younger workers, civil
 servants are encouraged to retire upon reaching the minimum
 retirement age of 55. Minimum monthly wages are set by the
 Government for all public and private sector jobs. Minimum
 wage rates, which range from the equivalent of $65 to $124 per
 month, are based on geographic zones and type of industry.
 Most workers in the modern sector are paid well in excess of
 the minimum wage. The lowest wages are insufficient to
 support a family, but usually are supplemented by a second job
 or another family member's earnings. Workers with
 middle-range wages also are likely to need second incomes to
 support a family, especially in Yaounde and Douala. The
 Ministry of Labor sets health and safety standards, and they
 are enforced by labor inspectori.
