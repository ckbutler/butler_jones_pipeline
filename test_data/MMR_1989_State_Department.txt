 BURMA
 Burma's military leaders seized power in September 1988 and
 lethally suppressed sustained, countrywide, prodemocracy
 demonstrations, The 1988 popular'uprising, unprecedented in
 Burma's history, had ended the long rule of the Burma
 Socialist Program Party.(BSPP), under now-retired chairman Ne
 Win who had drawn the nation into isolation and allowed it to
 decline economically. The September 1988 military takeover
 restored Ne Win's 26-year dictatorship by placing in power a
 group of senior military officers subservient to Ne Win and
 other top officials of the previous government. These men
 form the current ruling body--the 19-member State Law and
 Order Restoration Council (SLORC).
 The SLORC has repeatedly assured the populace and the
 international community that its stay in power is temporary
 and that.it will hold multiparty elections in May 1990. It
 established an election commission and provided for the
 registration of political parties, which reached as many as
 233 during 1989. In practice, the military leadership has
 maintained absolute control, keeping a heavy military presence
 in Rangoon and other urban areas, enforcing martial law,
 including a 10 p.m. to 4 a.m. curfew, imposing extensive
 surveillance on government employees and private citizens, and
 launching an aggressive propaganda campaign in the
 government-controlled media which inaccurately portrayed the
 events of 1988. It also attempted to blame Burma's political
 and economic instability on elements of the right and left, as
 well as foreign governments and news organizations. Early in
 the year, it tried to hinder opposition campaign efforts
 through intimidation, and eliminated much of the opposition
 through wide-scale arrests of the most popular party leaders
 and other political activists.
 Burma has fought various insurgencies since 1.948. Some of the
 ethnically based insurgents have fought for a measure of
 autonomy, if no longer for outright independence, against
 perceived domination by the Burmans, the majority ethnic
 group. In recent years most insurgent groups, financed
 primarily through narcotics production and trafficking, have
 engaged only in small-scale fighting in areas on Burma's
 borders. The Government ha  used their continued existence to
 justify in part continued authoritarian rule, including the
 operation of an extensive sec~txity apparatus. During 1989,
 the Government sought accommodation with several
 insurgent/narcotic trafficking groups, to gain short-term
 advantages vis-a-vis other dissident groups, to reinforce a
 split in the Burma Communist Party, and to secure areas for
 teak and logging concessions.
 Over the last 27 years, Ne Win's "Road to Socialism" reduced
 what was once the richest country in Southeast Asia to one
 designated by the United Nations as a "least developed"
 country. The military leaders promised a new open-door
 economic policy and passed a law to permit foreign investment
 but did not develop an economic strategy. The leadership,
 which lacked economic training or expertise, failed to address
 past mistakes--highly centralized decisionmaking, a vastly
 overvalued currency, uncontrolled monetary expansion, and an
 ineffective banking system--and made a bad economy worse.
 Burma's dismal human rights situation deteriorated even
 further in 1989. Government control over the population and
 interference in individual lives significantly increased, as
 
 
 781
 did credible reports of torture, wide-scale arbitrary arrests,
 disappearances, and compulsory labor.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 Although instances of government-instigated political killings
 were fewer in 1989 than 1988 (after the widespread shootings
 of demonstrators in 1988), there is substantial credible
 evidence of an undetermined number of civilian deaths at the
 hands of military government officials or individual soldiers
 throughout the year. The Government repeatedly denied these
 charges and, despite international criticism, made no apparent
 effort to investigate or to bring perpetrators to justice.
 In January numerous reports surfaced that some students who
 fled after the September takeover were killed after returning
 to their homes. These reports strongly indicated that a
 number of returned students died after having been mistreated
 while in government custody, and that the authorities
 routinely informed the dead students' parents that their
 children had died of disease. There were also credible
 reports that throughout the year some political prisoners died
 in jail as a result of torture or other mistreatment at the
 hands of the authorities.
 Eyewitnesses reported seeing deaths of men impressed as
 Burmese army porters after they were forced to walk ahead of
 troops through mine-infested terrain; deaths from gangrene
 after troops abandoned injured porters; overladen porters
 falling to their deaths from mountain paths; and ill-fed,
 inadequately clothed porters dying of disease. Amnesty
 International (AI) reported in August an eyewitness account of
 a soldier shooting a porter who could no longer walk. In that
 same report, AI also cited allegations of the killings of
 other porters, including members of ethnic minorities, and
 stated that their sources repeatedly accused the Burma Army
 33rd Light Infantry Division of unlawful killings.
 In some instances, soldiers reportedly committed murder and
 the crimes were then officially covered up. While it was not
 possible to confirm these reports, they are pl3usible and
 highly detailed, containing names of victims and perpetrators,
 addresses, military ranks, and sometimes regiment or division
 and military identification numbers, as well as date, time,
 and place of killing. Methods of killing reported included
 stabbing, bayoneting, and shooting. The victims' ages ranged
 from 13 to young adult.
 There were unconfirmed reports of summary executions by
 soldiers in the field. In one case, opposition leader Aung
 San Suu Kyi charged during a June press conference that eight
 students had been shot near a jade mine in Mohnyin township,
 Kachin State, by soldiers who reportedly made an effort to
 separate and kill students from among nonstudent youths
 present. AI also expressed concern about several reports of
 executions of students by soldiers in remote areas near the
 Thai/Burma border.
 As in past years, for security reasons, Burmese authorities
 did.not allow diplomatic observers to travel to areas of heavy
 
 
 782
 insurgent-activity. Therefore, it was not possible for them
 to ga-ther directly information about alleged human rights
 practices by the Government or by the insurgents in these
 areas. Government-controlled media continued to cite numerous
 examples of insurgent-generated violence that resulted in
 civilian deaths, and AI cited reports that insurgent forces
 had fired on civilian areas.
 b. Disappearance
 It is impossible to estimate with any accuracy the number of
 persons who disappeared and remained unaccounted for during
 the year. Families and friends of many who disappeared
 assumed the persons were under detention or died in jail,
 whether'this was the case or not (see Section l.d.). Others
 may haye been impressed to serve as army porter5. Some
 persons who disappeared may in fact be among the estimated
 2,000 to 3,000 students hiding in the Thai/Burma border areas
 and the 200 to 300 who have crossed into Thailand. During.
 periods of mass arrests--March-April, July-September--some
 persons disappeared but were later found to have been
 detained. Some of these were subsequently released.
 Burmese aubborities are reluctant to respond to diplomatic
 inquiries as to the whereabouts of Burmese and resident
 foreigners, mostly South Asians, who have been jailed or
 disappeared, and, .if they reply, limit comments to general
 statements that individuals were arrested for violations of
 existing laws.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Diplomatic observers in Rangoon had a considerable body of
 credible evidence--including eyewitness accounts--that
 torture, beatings, and mistreatment of political detainees
 were commonplace.'
 Instances of torture and mistreatment appeared more numerous
 in 1989 than previously, but this may have been due to
 increased reporting; most of the victims and their families
 and friends were educated and had greater access to
 foreigners. Physical and mental torture included beatings
 that caused permanent damage; sleep and food deprivation;
 cigarette-burns; electrical shocks to the genitals and
 elsewhere; and interrogations while the detainee was forced to
 stand in water or to assume painful, unnatural positions for
 long periods of time, (e.g., the "airplane" or "motorcycle"
 postures which forced victims into a half-sitting stance with
 arms outstretched; they were -beaten if they collapsed).
 Sometimes detainees were falsely told that family members had
 died or were in trouble.
 Despite public and-private expressions of concern by foreign
 governments and international human rights organizations over
 charges of torture, the Government repeatedly denied that it
 practiced or condoned torture and made no apparent efforts to
 investigate the charges. In at least some cases, victims were
 forced to sign a document stating that they had not been
 tortured.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The Government arbitrarily arrested or detained several
 thousand persons during 1989. A government spokesman stated
 
 
 783
 BURBMA
 on September 8 that "only" 811 persons, including 170
 students, had been detained since the military takeover and
 denied that it had arrested anyone for political beliefs.
 However, the Government has asserted that it is a crime to
 criticize the Government and its leaders; many have been
 detained for this reason.
 While exact numbers are unknown, a conservative estimate of
 politically motivated arrests during 1989 would be at least
 4,000. Many persons were arrested on ostensibly criminal
 charges. For example, a prominent political figure and a
 student leader, both members of the leading opposition party,
 were arrested and sentenced to 3 and 10 years respectively for
 alleged involvement in an abortion case, even though Burma's
 abortion law is rarely enforced. Many others were accused of
 "violating law and order." Regardless of the charges, most of
 the estimated 4,000 persons arrested were either active
 members of opposition political parties, persons involved in
 peaceful antigovernment demonstrations or pamphleteering, or
 students who returned home after having fled to Thailand or
 the border area after the military repression in September
 1988. In a September 1989 report, AI expressed continuing
 concern about 3 students said to have been forcibly
 repatriated from Thailand and arrested January 7 by Burmese
 authorities, and about 22 returned students reportedly
 detained January 10 and held incommunicado since then.
 In the period from July 23 to August 12, the Government
 released 18,752 prisoners from jails and prisons throughout
 the country. All of these prisoners had been arrested prior
 to the September 1988 takeover and most had been charged with
 nonpolitical crimes. It was widely believed but unconfirmed
 that the Government released them to make room for the large
 numbers of persons arrested for political reasons from July to
 September.
 Although arrests continued throughout 1989, there were several
 distinct periods during which larger numbers than usual were
 detained. Of the estimated 4,000 to 6,000 students who fled
 to Thailand and the border following the military takeover, an
 unknown number returned or tried to return to their homes;
 many of these were taken into custody despite government
 guarantees of their safety.
 In March and April, authorities detained at least several
 hundred political activists in Rangoon and Mandalay; by the
 first of May, many of the best known leaders in Burma's
 student opposition were in jail.
 On July 20 the Government placed Burma's most popular
 opposition figure, Aung San Suu Kyi, and her colleague, Tin
 0o, under house arrest where they have been held
 incommunicado. Their detentions were followed by the largest
 wave of arrests to date as authorities rounded up most of the
 leadership of many of the country's major opposition groups.
 Even before the establishment of military tribunals on July 18
 (see Section i.e.), there was no provision in Burmese law for
 a person in detention to seek a judicial determination of the
 legality of his detention. Previously, in serious cases
 involving national security, some persons were not formally
 charged but instead were held under an antisubversion act in
 indefinite detention without trial. In less serious political
 and security cases, detention under-the act was nominally
 limited to 180 days. According to Burmese law, those
 
 
 784
 designated "dangerous and destructive elements" can be placed
 under house arrest without formal charges for up to 1 year, as
 was the case with opposition leaders Aung San Suu Kyi and Tin
 Oo. However, under martial law and the military tribunals,
 anyone violating martial law orders is subject to summary
 justice. Individuals have no pretrial rights under martial
 law, particularly since the establishment of the military
 tribunals. The accused has no right to a defense lawyer,
 although in at least some cases military authorities allowed
 the presence of defense attorneys. There is no bail, although
 some defendants gain release by bribing officials.
 With regard to forced or compulsory labor, see Section 6.c.
 e.1 Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Burma was under martial law throughout 1989. On July 18, the
 Government invested regional military commanders with summary
 judicial powers and gave them discretion to try offenders
 either by courts formed under existing law or by military
 tribunals.' However, military tribunals have exclusive
 jurisdiction over cases concerning defiance of orders issued
 by the ruling State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC)
 or regional military commanders, and can mete out the death
 sentence, life imprisonment, or at least 3 years' imprisonment
 with labor regardless of existing law. The tribunals also can
 reject or summon witnesses. Trials are public only at the
 township level, and never under the military tribunals. Under
 Burmese law, attorneys are not provided at public expense, and
 the accused is not presumed to be innocent.
 In practice, military tribunals tried virtually all offenses
 --criminal or political--committed after the tribunals were
 established, although civilian judges continued to hear some
 earlier cases. On October 19, a military tribunal sentenced
 to death an interpreter for a French journalist who allegedly
 had helped the journalist film a beheading in 1988. During
 trials, court officials must submit daily reports for military
 review. Although reports were also given to the attorney
 general, military authorities had the final say. The accused
 were not guaranteed the right to a defense attorney. When
 allowed to participate in a trial, a defense attorney's role
 was severely limited. Lawyers were warned that an overly
 aggressive defense jeopardized both client and lawyer. In
 numerous cases, the tribunal refused to admit witnesses or
 evidence central to the defense. Military tribunals imposed
 heavy sentences on political prisoners. For example, a writer
 was sentenced to 20 years with labor for allegedly exhorting
 navy personnel to join in the 1988 prodemocracy
 demonstrations, and a lawyer was given 14 years, labor for
 providing "false" news to the British Broadcasting
 Corporation. Appeal is theoretically possible, subject to
 certain conditions: appeal of a sentence to 3 years'
 imprisonment must be submitted to the regional commander
 within 30 days; in cases involving the death sentence, life
 imprisonmeft, or sentences over 3 years, appeals must be made
 to the army commander-in-chief within 30 days. The army
 commander-in-chief was designated final arbiter on all
 tribunal decisions and sentences. In practice, military
 authorities have been known to hamper the appeal process by
 refusing to cooperate with and attempting to intimidate
 attorneys.
 It is impossible accurately to estimate the number of
 political prisoners held at any one time. However, separate
 
 
 785
 BURMA
 reliable sources reported about 6,000 prisoners, including
 2,000 students in Insein jail in April and about 2,000
 political prisoners in Insein in September. It appears there
 were at least 4,000 politically motivated arrests during the
 year, many of which involved ostensibly criminal charges. The
 Government denies holding any political prisoners (see Section
 l.d.).
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home or
 Correspondence
 In 1989 the State intruded extensively into the lives of
 private citizens. Under martial law, forced entry and
 warrantless searches of private homes and other premises were
 commonplace and were often conducted without warning. The
 Government strictly monitored the travel and whereabouts of
 many individuals. A well-developed system of neighborhood
 informers reported on dissidents and criticism of the
 Government. Most people believed that security personnel
 monitored private correspondence and telephone calls.
 g. Use of Excessive Force and Violations of Humanitarian
 Law in Internal Conflicts
 The Burmese army has fought various insurgencies for the past
 four decades. These conflicts apparently have resulted in
 numerous transgressions on all sides, such as the mistreatment
 or killing of prisoners, neglect of the sick and wounded,
 impressment of civilians for porter duty, and indiscriminate
 attacks on civilian areas. Insurgents and the Government have
 repeatedly accused each other of human rights violations. In
 August, AI expressed concern over allegations of ill-treatment
 and unlawful killing by the Burma army in insurgent areas. AI
 also stated that seveial insurgent groups continued to attack
 civilian targets.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Already severely restricted, freedom qf speech and press in
 Burma became virtually nonexistent in 1989. Imposition of
 martial law overrode even nominal constitutional provisions
 for freedom of expression. Although the Government permitted
 the registration of politial parties, in practice opposing
 views and criticism of the Government were not tolerated.
 After popular opposition figure Aung San Suu Kyi publicly
 criticized the current leadership as well as former leader Ne
 Win, she was placed under house arrest, as was the chairman of
 her party, the National League for Democracy. Thousands of
 other political activists were also detained after peaceably
 expressing antigovernment views (see Section l.d).
 Government workers were instructed not to discuss politics in
 their offices at the risk of losing their jobs. They were not
 allowed to join or support political parties and had to sign
 statements promising they would not participate in political
 activities. Even private citizens became reluctant to express
 opinions out of fear of government-paid informers.
 As government employees, teachers and college professors are
 subject to the same restrictions on freedom of speech,
 political activities, and publications, and fear of reprisal
 as other civil servants. Content of lessons and lectures is
 severely circumscribed.
 
 
 786
 As in the past, the Government runs and operates the mass
 media, including television, radio, and the sole national
 newspaper, The Working People's Daily. Newspaper editors are
 appointed by the Government and editorials must be approved in
 advance. Journalists are subject to strict publishing and
 broadcast guidelines, especially on domestic matters. Even
 international'news is subject to prior review and selection.
 All forms of communication--domestic and imported books and
 periodicals, stage plays, motion pictures, and musical
 recordings--are subject to government control and censorship.
 Criticism of the Government, government officials, or sectors
 of the economy controlled or partially controlled by the
 Government is not permitted in the press. On May 26 the
 Government announced a stricter enforcement of the 1962
 Printeis and Publishers Registration Law expressly to prohibit
 political parties from releasing documents not previously
 cleared by the Government. Also in 1989, the Government
 imposed stricter regulations over video and audio cassette
 rentals and for a period of time closed down all video and
 cassette rental shops.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The right of assembly exists only for those organizations
 permitted by law and duly registered with the Government. In
 practice, however, even the'activities of these organizations
 are severely restricted. The martial law edict decreeing that
 people are not allowed to gather in groups of more than five
 was unevenly enforced. Assembly within the premises of
 political parties has been limited to 50 persons. In fact,
 however, some party members in groups of less than 50 have
 been arrested on their premises for "violating law and
 order." For a time, people were allowed to congregate at
 government-sanctioned rock concerts, and in June and early
 July authorities did not interfere with increasingly large
 crowds that gathered to hear opposition leader Aung San Suu
 Kyi. In mid-July troops beat with bamboo sticks or arrested
 peaceful demonstrators for violating martial law regulations.
 Trade associations and professional bodies, like other
 organizations in Burma, are permitted only if sanctioned by
 the Government. Their activities are strictly monitored and
 their members are not free to discuss politics or express
 criticism of the Government.
 For a discussion of freedom of association as it applies to
 labor unions, see Section 6.a.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Burma is a secular state dominated by the Burman ethnic
 group. Freedom of religion is provided for in the
 Constitution and, even under martial law, is widely observed
 in practice. The great majority of Burmese are Buddhist,
 although there are sizable Christian, Muslim, and animist
 minorities based principally in various minority ethnic groups.
 While minority religious groups are alnowed to practice
 freely, security services monitor the activities of some
 religious communities closely. Some persons of mixed Burman
 and ethnic minority ancestry have been known to convert to
 Buddhism as a way of strengthening their claim to be
 considered ethnic Burmans.
 
 
 787
 BURMA
 There is considerable social prejudice against Muslims in
 Burma. Occasionally this erupts in violence and has led to
 government action infringing on the practice of Islam.
 Religious groups can and do maintain links with coreligionists
 in other countries, including-the Catholic Church, which
 maintains ties to the Vatican. Foreign religious
 representatives are usually allowed only tourist visas and are
 not permitted to preach, proselytize, or remain to carry out
 missionary work. There is at least one long-time resident
 foreign Catholic priest (Italian) in Burma.
 All religious organizations are required to register with the
 Government. Religious publications are subject to the same
 governmental control and censorship as other publications. On
 occasion, the Government has used a nationalization law to
 take control of the property of religious organizations.
 The Government in recent years promulgated two directives that
 limit the right of assembly and association of Buddhist monks.
 Acting through the government-controlled hierarchy of the
 monkhood (Sangha), the State has prohibited'monks from
 attending various forms of public entertainment. While this
 ostensibly has been done, in part, to maintain the moral
 purity of the Sangha, it is also aimed at curbing the
 political activities of monks, one of the most'influential
 groups in Burmese society and one which has been heavily
 involved in the 1988 antigovernment protests.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Burmese citizens have the right to live anywhere in the
 country. Except for limitations in areas of insurgent
 activity, Burmese citizens can travel freely within the
 country but must inform local authorities of their temporary
 place of residence, a restriction greatly tightened under
 martial law. In 1989 people who failed to report either
 guests or intentions to stay overnight to the authorities were
 subject to a jail term and arrests sometimes were made.
 Noncitizen residents, including persons born in Burma who hold
 foreigners, registration cards, must obtain prior permission
 to travel. Legal requirements, bureaucratic procedures, and
 corruption cause long delays in obtaining passports. Severe
 limits are placed on what emigrants are allowed to take with
 them.
 Burmese citizens who left the country legally are generally
 allowed to return to visit relatives. However, Burma does not
 recognize dual citizenship; acquiring citizenship in another
 country results in the loss of Burmese citizenship. With few
 exceptions, those who take citizenship in another country are
 banned from returning to Burma. Emigrants wishing to return
 permanently are required to reapply for Burmese citizenship.
 Burmese who leave the country illegally cannot legally
 return. There were reported instances of Burmese wishing to
 return to visit ill or dying parents being denied permission
 to enter Burma.
 Burma does not permit foreign refugees or displaced persons to
 resettle or seek safe haven within Burma. The Government
 treats persons claiming to be refugees as illegal immigrants
 and imprisons them, although it freed and deported a number of
 imprisoned Vietnamese refugees in 1988.
 
 
 788
 BURMA
 Throughout the year, the Government imposed a 10 p.m. to 4
 a.m. curfew on the entire country. In most cases, the curfew
 was strictly enforced and violators were often punished. On
 at least several occasions, riverboat passengers, stranded at
 the jetty in Rangoon after curfew, were sent before a military
 tribunal and sentenced to 3 years' imprisonment.
 During i989, and particularly in November and December, the
 Government carried out a forced relocation of urban poor
 countrywide, most often to inadequately prepared sites far
 from jobs, schools, and extended families. In the great
 majority of cases, there was no compensation. Those forced to
 move were compelled to dismantle their old homes-at their own
 expense and also to bear the costs of purchasing a new site,
 construttion materials, and labor for building a new house, as
 well, as transportation expenses. There were many unconfirmed
 reports that those without funds or assets to sell were moved
 to reclaimed jungle sites miles from urban areap to cultivate
 agricultural products to sell to nearby government factories
 at controlled prices. The Goverment described all those
 forced to move as "squatters," but in at least some instances
 people hadpurchased their property and held deeds to it.
 Some reportedly lived, in apartments or houses coveted by the
 military or were told they lived too near military
 installations or government offices. At the same time, the
 Government offered attractively priced, relatively luxurious
 housing in areas of rapid real estate appreciation to-
 high-ranking military officers, and also provided houses and
 land free of charge to former members of the now defunct Burma
 Socialist Program Party which ruled Burma for 26 years.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 The Burmese people do not have the right or the ability
 peacefully to change their government. .In 1988 the military
 seized power and suppressed a massive prodemocracy movement by
 killing at least 1,000 peaceful demonstrators and injuring
 many more countrywide. Throughout 1989 the SLORC tolerated no
 dissent or criticism and controlled the population by
 imposition of martial law, wide-scale arrests of political
 activists, and intimidation. Although the SLORC allowed the
 formation and registration of political parties and promised
 elections scheduled for May 1990, its subsequent barring of
 the major opposition figures from the elections virtaally
 eliminated hopes that this process would be free or fair.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Righte
 The Government does not permit investigation of its human
 rights practices, nor is it willing to discuss human rights
 problems with outside government or nongovernmental
 organizations. -Requests for meetings specifically to discuss
 broad humar rights issues or individual cases are usually
 deflected. The Government consistently denied charges of
 human rights violations and publicly and repeatedly criticized
 the U.S. Government and AI for what it called "fabricated"
 reports of torture and other abuses and blamed both for
 "interfering in Burma's internal affairs."
 No internal human rights organizations exist. A grpup calling
 itself Amnesty International of Burma, established during the
 1988 prodemocracy demonstrations, was subsequently denied
 
 
 789
 registration as a legal organization by the Government and
 apparently has been disbanded.
 The Government is conscious of and resents the outside
 scrutiny to which Burma's human rights record has been
 subjected since its lethal suppression of prodemocracy
 demonstrations in 1988. Burma was the subject of a U.N. Human
 Rights Commission (UNHRC) decision in February 1989 and also
 is scheduled to be discussed at the 1990 UNHRC meeting. AI
 expressed concern about actions of the Burmese Government
 several times during 1989. The Governments of the European
 Community and of Australia on several occasions publicly
 expressed concern over human rightsabuses in Burma.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Burma's numerous ethnic minorities have their own distinct
 cultures and languages. Economic development among minorities
 has lagged, and many still live at the subsistence level.
 This is due in part to geographic factors which impede
 economic development in the rugged, isolated, border areas
 populated-by minorities. Minorities have been
 underrepresented in the Government and are largely excluded
 from the military leadership.
 Persons of nonethnic Burmese ancestry, primarily Indians and
 Chinese, while denied full citizenship and excluded from party
 or government positions, continue to play an important role in
 the economy, a factor resented by many majority Burmans.
 The government press.has repeatedly denigrated Westerners or
 those with mixed blood in pejorative terms, such as
 "long-noses" or "green eyes."
 Women in Burma have historically played an active role in
 society, but this varies with cultural traditions and ethnic
 backgrounds.  In general, Burmese women enjoy most of the same
 legal rights as men. They keep their own names after
 marriage, are active in trade, and often control family
 finances.
 There is no violence directed specifically against women in
 Burma. Although women as well as men died or were injured at
 the hands of the Government, and in some cases reportedly were
 raped, indications are that authorities generally treated
 women better than men in detention. While in 1988 there were
 unconfirmed but persistent reports of rape of several women in
 detention by soldiers or police, rape is viewed with great
 abhorrence by Burmese society.
 Burma is governed solely by the military. Members of the
 armed forces and their families enjoy privileges not available
 to others. For example, during the enforced closure of all
 schools and universities, which lasted over a year, military
 children were allowed to attend special schools often taught
 by military spouses. At the same time, the military
 leadership closed down private schools set up by political
 parties for teaching poor children whose parents could not
 afford privately funded tutors and threatened legal action
 against those who taught children privately.
 
 
 790
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 There are no trade unions and no independent labor movement in
 Burma. Workers do not have the right to organize
 independently, to bargain collectively, or to strike. After
 the GoVernment violently suppressed prodemocracy
 demonstrations in 1988, and imposed martial law, even
 government-controlled workers' and peasants' mass
 organizations-were disbanded. There were no strikes in 1989.
 In April the United States suspended Burma's eligibility for
 trade concessions under the Generalized System of Preferences
 program until the Government takes steps to afford its labor
 force'internationally recognized workers' rights. Again in
 1989, as in previous years, committees of the International
 Labor Orgabization (ILO) criticized'Burma's legislation
 imposing a single trade union structure which contravenes the
 principles of ILO Convention 87 on Freedom of Association,
 which Burma has ratified. The ILO committees, however,
 expressed the hope that prospective political changes which
 auger an end to the single party system would also lead to the
 repeal of the single trade union law.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 As noted, workers have no eight to bargain collectively.
 Labor arbitration boards which, while government controlled,
 at least theoretically provided an opportunity for the airing
 of labor disputes, have been disbanded. The military
 authorities are the sole authority over workers' issues. No
 special economic zones exist in Burma.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Burma's legal code does not contain any statutory prohibition
 of forced labor. For years the Burma army frequently
 conscripted civilian males in the vicinity of military
 operations (primarily In areas populated by ethnic minorities)
 to serve as porters. On September 22, a government spokesman
 acknowledged that the Burma army has traditionally used local
 residents in insurgent areas as porters, but denied reports
 that the military authorities had used students or other
 detained youths. According to eyewitness and firsthand
 reports during 1989, the Government conducted periodic
 roundups on the streets of Rangoon and other major cities of
 unemployed or those who could not prove employment. An
 unknown number of these persons were impressed for duty as
 Burma army porters in insurgent areas, while others were able
 to bribe their way out of custody. Some reliable reports
 strongly indicate that students and other political activists
 also were taken from Rangoon to serve as porters or as
 laborers in government mines or other installations.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 Children between 13 and 15 may work for 4 hours a day. The
 penalty for employers who disregard this regulation is 2 years
 in prison. However, the -regulation is not strictly enforced.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 There is a 5-day, 35-hour workweek for employees in the public
 sector and a 6-day, 44-hour workweek for private and
 
 
 791
 parastatal sector employees, with overtime paid for additional
 work. However, public sector employees seldom actually work
 more than 6 1/2 hours a day. Workers have 21 paid holidays a
 year, and there are numerous legal provisions to protect
 workers' health and safety, but these are not strictly
 enforced even for government workers. The legal minimum
 government wage was raised in March from about $1.00 per day
 to approximately $2.25 at current official exchange rates,
 although at the-more realistic.free-market rate this.works out
 to about 21 cents a day. Wages commonly have lagged far
 behind inflation and are not nearly enough for subsistence,
 particularly in the case of large or extended families. In
 the private sector, the minimum wage law applies only to
 cheroot-rolling plants and rice mills. There are rules
 governing health and safety conditions at workplaces,
 pertaining to room size, ventilation, fire hazards, and the
 availability of latrines and drinking water. In practice,
 these are seldom enforced, particularly in the private sector.
