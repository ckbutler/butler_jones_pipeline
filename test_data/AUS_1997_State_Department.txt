 AUSTRALIA
 Australia has a federal system of government and a long history as a multiparty
 parliamentary democracy. The judiciary is independent.
 Federal, state, and local police are under the firm control of the civilian authori-
 ties and carry out their functions in accordance with the law. There were occasional
 reports that police committed abuses.
 A highly developed economy, which includes manufacturing, mining, agriculture,
 and services, provides most citizens with a high per capita income. A wide range
 of government programs offers assistance for disadvantaged citizens.
 The Government respects the human rights of its citizens, and the law and judici-
 ary provide effective means of dealing with individual instances of abuse. There
 were occasional reports that police beat or otherwise abused persons. The Govern-
 ment administers many programs to improve the socioeconomic conditions of Aborig-
 ines and Torres Straits Islanders, who together form about 2 percent of the popu-
 lation, and to address longstanding discrimination against them. Societal discrimi-
 nation and violence against women are problems which are being actively ad-
 dressed.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political
 killings by government officials. However, persons died in custody or during police
 attempts to detain them (see Section 1.c.).
 b.Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The law prohibits all such practices. However, police commonly mistreat indigenous
 people (see Section 5). Amnesty International reported several incidents that in-
 volved such abuses. In one case in 1996, an Aboriginal woman who was a rape vic-
 tim was held in custody for 15 hours and denied medical treatment. State and terri-
 torial police forces have internal affairs units that investigate allegations of abuse
 and report to a civilian ombudsman.
 During a 12-month reporting period ending in July, 17 Aboriginal people were re-
 ported to have died in custody or during police attempts to detain them. The total
 was 21 for 1995-1996. Aborigines account for 20 percent of such deaths, while con-
 stituting 2 percent of the population. Aboriginal people are imprisoned at a rate 18
 times that of the general population.
 Prison conditions meet minimum international standards, and the Government
 permits visits by human rights monitors.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The law prohibits arbitrary arrest, deten-
 tion, or exile, and the government observes this prohibition.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution provides for an independent judi-
 ciary, and the executive and legislative branches respect its provisions.
 There is a well-developed system of federal and state courts, with the High Court
 at its apex. Almost all criminal trials are conducted by courts established under
 state and territorial legislation. The Federal Court and the High Court have very
 limited roles to play.
 The law provides for the right to a fair trial and an independent judiciary vigor-
 ousl enforces this right.
 When trials are conducted in local courts, the magistrates sit alone. In higher
 courts, namely the state district or county courts and the state or territorial su-
 preme courts, trials are usually conducted by judge and jury. The jury decides on
 the facts and verdict after a trial conducted by a judge.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.

 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The law
 prohibits such practices, government authorities generally respect these prohibi-
 tions, and violations are subject to effective legal sanction.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-Australia does not have a bill of rights. In two
 decisions the High Court has indicated that freedom of political discourse is implied
 in the Constitution. The Government respects these rights in practice. An independ-
 ent press, an effective judiciary, and a functioning democratic political system com-
 bine to ensure freedom of speech and of the press, including academic freedom.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-Although these rights are not
 codified in law, citizens exercise them without government restriction.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of religion and the
 Government respects this right in practice. A provision of the Constitution precludes
 the adoption of a state religion. Minority religions are given equal rights to land,
 status and building of places of worship.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The law provides for these rights, and the Government respects them
 in practice.
 The Government encourages migration to Australia by skilled migrants, family
 members, and refugees.
 The Government cooperates with the United Nations High Commissioner for Ref-
 ugees and other humanitarian organizations in assisting refugees. There is no provi-
 sion for first asylum. The Government either grants a protection visa, with full resi-
 dence and employment rights, or refuses it, with no in-between measures. The Gov-
 ernment has continued to repatriate forcibly individuals who it has determined do
 not have a valid claim to refugee status in accordance with relevant United Nations
 convention definitions. Human rights and refugee advocacy groups maintain that
 the Government's refugee and asylum adjudication process is applied inconsistently.
 Under the Migration Reform Act of 1994, asylum-seekers, who arrive at the bor-
 der without prior authorization to enter the country, are automatically detained, but
 may be released from detention if they meet certain criteria-including age, ill-
 health, and experiences of torture or other trauma. The majority of asylum-seekers
 are detained for the duration of the often-prolonged asylum process. The detention
 policy has led to extensive litigation initiated by human rights and refugee advocacy
 groups, which charge that the sometimes lengthy detentions violate the human
 rights of the asylum seekers.
 In 1996-97, Australia accepted 73,900 migrants, with 11,903 admitted under the
 humanitarian program, which accepts refugees and those in refugee-like situations
 in urgent need of resettlement. This figure included 2,251 persons already in Aus-
 tralia who were granted refugee status.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The Constitution provides citizens with the right to change their government
 peacefully, and citizens exercise this right in practice through periodic, free, and fair
 elections held on the basis of universal suffrage and mandatory voting. In March
 1996, voters ended 13 years of Labor Party government at the federal level by elect-
 ing a Liberal-National Party coalition Government.
 No legal impediments exist to prevent women and indigenous people from holding
 public office. However, historical patterns of bias against women have contributed
 to their underrepresentation in government and politics. Approximately 22 percent
 of federal parliamentarians are women. The percentage increased from 14 percent
 as a result of the 1996 election. The Government and the opposition have both de-
 clared their intent to increase the numbers of women elected to public office.
 The deleterious effects of poor educational achievement and a generally inferior
 socioeconomic status have contributed significantly to the underrepresentation of
 Aboriginals among political leaders. There are no Aboriginal Members of Par-
 liament.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 A wide variety of human rights groups operate without government restriction
 (and in some instances with government funding), investigating and publishing
 their findings on human rights cases. Government officials cooperate and respond
 to their views.

 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The law prohibits discrimination based on these factors, and the Government and
 an idepndentudiciary vigorously enforce the prohibition.
 In July the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission awarded a record
 $38,460 (A$55,000)to a Ugandan-bor factory worker whose company failed to pro-
 tect him from racial taunts at his workplace.
 Women--Social analysts and commentators estimate that domestic violence may
 affect as many as one family in three or four. Wife beating is particularly prevalent
 i certain Aboriginal communities. The Government recognizes that domestic vio-
 lence and economic discrimination are serious problems and the statutrily inde-
 pendent Sex Discrimination Commissioner actively addresses these and other areas
 of discrimination. Government statisticians state that, because of underreporting
 and the lack of an agreed method for collecting statistics, it is impossible to provide
 an acurate national profile of the number of women who are victims of domestic
 violence.
 In 1992 Australia's High Court made sterilization of retarded women and girls il-
 legal if not medically required, unless permission was granted by a court or tribu-
 nal. In December, however1 a report commissioned by the federal Human Rights and
 Equal Opportunity Commission was released that reported that, since permission
 has been granted only 17 times, surgeons in the public health system had illegally
 sterilized more than 1,000 retarded women and girls since 1992. The report added
 that the real figure might be several times higher, since the data did not included
 patients whose sterilization was concealed by being listed as another operation. The
 Health Ministry responded that the figure was tteo igh, and that the actual number
 of cases was one-fourth or one-fifth of that total.
 Women have equal status under the law, and the law provides for pay equity.
 There are highly organized and effective private and public women's rights orgi-
 zations at the federal, state, and local levels. There is a federal-level Office of the
 Status of Women that monitors women's rights. The federal Sex Discrimination
 Commissioner receives complaints and attempts to resolve those that are deemed
 valid. A 1994 U.N. report estimated that women receive approximately 90 percent
 of wags padto men for substantially similar work.
 Children.-The Government demonstrates is strong commitment to children's
 rights and welfare through its well-funded systems of public education, day care,
 and medical care. The Government recently decided to remove subsidies to children
 under th  ae eqof 18.
 The federal Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission receives com-
 plaints and attempts to resolve those it finds valid. Similarly, the six states and two
 territories investigate complaints of neglect or child abuse and institute practical
 measures aimed at protecting the child when such omplaints prove founded. The
 Government has enacted strict legislation aimed at restricting the trade in, and pos-
 session of, child pornography, and which further allows suspectd edctphiles to be
 tried in Australia regrdless of where the crime was committed. There is no societal
 pattern of abuse.
 People With Disabiities.-Legislation prohibits discrimination against disabled
 persons i employment, education, or other state services. The Disability Discrimi-
 nation Cmmissioner promotes compliance with federal laws prohibitin discrimina-
 tion against disabled persons. The Commissioner also promotes energtic implemen-
 tation and enforcement of state laws that require equal access and otherwise protect
 the rights of disabled persons.
 There is no federal legislation mandating the uniform provision of accessibility for
 the disabled. is lawful to deny employment or services to those with disabilities
 if there are reasonable grounds for believing that the disabled person would be un-
 able to carry out the work or would require the employer or service provider to fur-
 nish services or facilities that could not reasonably be provided.
 Indigenous People.-The Racial Discrimination Act of 1975 prohibits discrimina-
 tion on grounds of race, color, descent, or national or ethnic origin. The Ministry
 for Aboriginal Affairs, in conjunction with the Aboriginal and Torres Straits Islander
 Commissio n (ATSIC), has the main responsibility for initiating, coordinating, and
 monitoring all governmental efforts to improve the l of lie of indigenous peo-
 ple. A wide variety of government iniiatioves and programs seek to improve all as-
 pects of Aboriginal and Torres Straits Islander life.
 In practice, however, indigenous Australians continue to experience significantly
 higher rates of imprisonment, inferior access to medical and educational institu-
 tions, greatly reduced life expectancy rates, elevated levels of unemployment, and
 general discrimination, which contribute to an overwhelming feeling of powerless-
 ness.

 Nationally, indigenous people are imprisoned at 18 times the rate of nonindige-
 nous people. Over 45 percent of Aboriginal men between the ages of 20 and 30 years
 have been arrested at some time in their lives. The prison incarceration rate for in-
 digenous juvenile offenders is 21 times that of nonindigenous juveniles. Indigenous
 groups claim that the Government's lack of response to a series of recommendations
 by the 1991 Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody contributes to
 these disturbing statistics. Human rights observers claim that socioeconomic condi-
 tions give rise to the common precursors of indigenous crime, e.g. unemployment,
 homelessness, and boredom.
 Indigenous groups charge that police harassment of indigenous people is pervasive
 and that racial discrimination among police and prison custodians persists. A
 human rights delegation that visited Australia in 1996 alleged a pattern of ill-treat-
 ment and arbitrary arrests occurring against a backdrop of systematic discrimina-
 tion. In one study, 85 percent of juvenile indigenous suspects reported being hit,
 punched, kicked or slapped by police. Most of the juveniles interviewed had com-
 plained about violence occurring after apprehension and during questioning about
 alleged offenses. Government statistics confIn the common perception among indig-
 enous people that they are systematically mistreated by police. Government reports
 have suggested that the pursuit of economic self-determination for indigenous peo-
 ple would greatly assist in solving the crime problems in indigenous communities
 and the differences in rates of imprisonment.
 The average life expectancy of an indigenous person is 20 years less than that
 of a nonindigenous person. The infant mortality rate for indigenous children is 3
 times that of nonindigenous children. The maternal mortality rate for indigenous
 women is 5 times that of nonindigenous women. The incidence of illnesses such as
 tuberculosis, leprosy, hepatitis, and of sexually transmitted diseases is 10 times
 greater among indigenous people than nonindigenous people. Data indicate that
 22.5 percent of indigenous children complete secondary education compared with
 76.2 percent of nonindigenous children. Government statistics for 1995 show that
 the participation rate in university education for Aborigines is 2.4 percent (up from
 1.8 percent in 1991) compared with 2.7 percent for non-Aborigines.
 Government programs, including a $750 million indigenous land fund and a "Fed-
 eral Social Justice Package," aim at ameliorating the real challenges faced by indig-
 enous Australians. The Government is also seeking ways to improve upon 1993 Na-
 tive Title Legislation which has been largely unsuccessful in assisting Aborigines to
 establish and pursue title to land. The December 1996 High Court Wik decision,
 which ruled that native title to land could coexist with pastoral leases, complicated
 an already confused situation. The Government's "Ten-Point Plan" response to the
 decision, if passed in Parliament, would give states and territories the right to con-
 vert leasehold to freehold, and thus finally extinguish native title to lands.
 In May, after an inquiry, the Government's Human Rights and Equal Opportunity
 Commission declared that the country's former policy of forcibly separating Aborigi-
 nal children from their parents, which was in effect from 1910 until the early
 1970's, was a form of genocide. The policy was based on the belief that Aborigines
 were a doomed race, and saving the children was the only humane alternative. In
 a 1994 survey, the Government found that 10 percent of Aborigines older than 25-
 approximately 100,000 persons-had been separated from their parents in child-
 hood. The Commission and Aboriginal leaders called for a government apology and
 compensation for the children uprooted under the assimilation policy. The Govern-
 ment initially ruled out any compensation, and blocked an opposition Labor Party
 motion for an apology to the "stolen generation" of Aborigines. However, in Decem-
 ber the Government announced a $40 million aid package to, among other things,
 establish a national network of "family link-up" services, fund 50 counselors to help
 those affected by the policy, and expand a network of regional support centers. How-
 ever, the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs reiterated Prime Minister Howard's earlier
 rejection of calls for an apology as "asking one generation to accept legal responsibil-
 ity for the acts of earlier generations."
 National /Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-Although Asians make up less than 5 per-
 cent of the population, they account for 40 percent of recent immigrants. Public
 opinion surveys indicate growing criticism of immigration, and there were reports
 of a sharp increase in incidents of racial harassment, with Asians, as well as Aborig-
 ines, reporting that they have been spat on, shoved, and threatened. In a survey
 published in 1996 by the Chinese-language newspaper Sing Tao, more than half the
 respondents said that they had been abused verbally or physically in the previous
 2 months.
 
 
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The law and practice provide workers, including
 public servants, freedom of association domestically and internationally. Approxi-
 mately 32 percent of the work force is unionized.
 Unions carry out their functions free from government or political control, but
 most local affiliates belong to state branches of the Australian Labor Party (ALP).
 Union members must make up at least 50 percent of the delegates to ALP con-
 gresses, but unions do not participate or vote as a bloc.
 Prior to 1997, there were no restrictions on the right to strike. However, the
 Workplace Relations Act, which went into effect on January 1, restricts the right
 to strike to the period when a new wages and working conditions contract is being
 negotiated. Legislation that went into force in 1994 for the first time legalized what
 had always been a de facto right to strike.
 Laws and regulations prohibit retribution against strikers and labor leaders, and
 they are effectively enforced. In practice employers tend to avoid legal remedies
 (e.g., secondary boycott injunctions) available to them in order to preserve a long-
 term relationshp with their unions.
 Unions may freely form and join federations or confederations, and they actively
 participate in international bodies.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The law and practice provide
 workers with the right to organize and bargain collectively, and the law protects
 them from antiunion discrimination.
 The Workplace Relations Act contains curbs on union power, restrictions on
 strikes, and a new unfair-dismissal system. Several unions are considering challeng-
 ing the 1997 law on the grounds that it violates the right to assembly provided for
 in several International Labor Organization conventions that Australia has signed.
 The primary curb on union power is abolition of closed shops and union demarca-
 tions. Although unions are weakened, this provision could create many small and
 competing unions at an individual worksite. The restrictions on strikes include
 heavy fines for labor unrest during the life of an agreement and tougher secondary-
 boycott provisions. The new unfair-dismissal system further limits redress and com-
 pensation claims.
 The negotiation of contracts covering wages and working conditions is gradually
 shifting away from the centralized system of the past. Previously legislation pro-
 vided for the negotiation of simpler "enterprise agreements," which were negotiated
 by individual companies with their workers-or with the relevant union(s). The fed-
 eral and state governments administered centralized minimum-wage awards and
 provided quasi-judicial arbitration, supplemented by industrywide or company-by-
 company collective bargaining. The Workplace Relations Act also provides for the
 negotiation of "Australian Workplace Agreements" (AWA's) between employers and
 individual workers. These agreements are subject to far fewer government regula-
 tions than the awards. At present the AWA's are required to be roughly equivalent
 to basic working conditions in the award that would apply to the sector to which
 the firm belongs.
 There are no export processing zones. The Darwin Trade Development Zone,
 Northern Territory, attempts to increase exports via a geographically defined free
 trade zone. In practice the Darwin initiative is focused almost exclusively on its
 Asian neighbors to the north and west.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Although there are no laws pro-
 hibiting it, forced labor, including forced and bonded labor by children, is not prac-
 ticed.
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Emloyment.-The law
 does not prohibit forced and bonded labor by children, but such practices are not
 known to occur (see Section 6.c.).
 There is no federally mandated minimum age of employment, but state-imposed
 compulsory educational requirements, monitored and enforced by state educational
 authorities, effectively prevent most children from joining the work force until they
 are 15 or 16 years of age. Federal and state governments monitor and enforce a net-
 work of laws, which vary from state to state, governing minimum school-leaving
 age, minimum age to claim unemployment benefits, and minimum age to engage in
 specified occupations.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-Although a formal minimum wage exists, it
 has not been relevant in wage agreements since the 1960's. Instead, 80 percent of
 workers are covered by differing minimum wage rates for individual trades and pro-
 fessions, all of which are sufficient to provide a decent standard of living for a work-
 er and family.
 Most workers are employees of incorporated organizations. For them, a complex
 body of government regulations, as well as decisions of applicable federal or state
 
 
 684
 industrial relations commissions, prescribe a 40-hour or shorter workweek, paid va-
 cations, sick leave, and other benefits, including at least one 24-hour rest period per
 week.
 Federal or state safety laws apply to every workplace.
 The Occupational Health and Safety (Commonwealth Employment) Act of 1991
 provides federal employees with the legal right to cease work if they believe that
 particular work activities pose an immediate threat to individual health or safety.
 Most states and territories have laws that grant similar rights to their employees.
 At a minimum, private sector employees have recourse to state health and safety
 commissions, which will investigate complaints and demand remedial action.
