 LATVIA*
 An independent Baltic state between the two World Wars, Latvia
 was annexed by the Soviet' Union in 1940 as a constituent
 republic of the U.S.S.R. The United States does not recognize
 the forcible incorporation of Latvia into the U.S.S.R.
 Like the other Baltic states, Latvia is subjected to the same
 centralized rule, the same Constitution and judicial system,
 the same restrictions on civil and political liberties, and
 the same police controls as the republics in the Soviet
 Union. Moreover, Soviet policy toward the Latvian nation
 arouses grave concern because the process of Russification
 threatens its survival as a distinct ethnic group. The influx
 of Slavic settlers has reduced the proportion of Latvians in
 Latvia to only 53 percent of the total population.
 Like the other Baltic states, Latvia is regarded as
 economically better off than most areas of the Soviet Union.
 This is beginning to change, however, as central authorities
 divert scarce resources to less developed areas.
 Human rights violations continued in 1985. Expressions of
 national consciousness were harshly repressed. The state of
 religious liberty continued to deteriorate as the Soviet
 authorities harassed the clergy and lay leaders of several
 faiths. Latvians active in human rights issues continued to
 face persecution and arrest.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section I Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 Several Latvian activists have died in Soviet custody in the
 last several years, although no such deaths were reported in
 1985. However, official responsibility for the deaths of
 persons involved in human rights activities is difficult to
 establish. Soviet persecution of Latvian activists, however,
 may lead to their deaths.
 b. Disappearance
 There are no known instances of permanent or prolonged
 disappearance.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment
 or Punishment
 Throughout the Soviet system, cruel and inhuman treatment of
 political prisoners occurs during both interrogation and
 confinement to labor camp, prison, or psychiatric hospital.
 Physical and psychological abuse of prisoners is common, as is
 detention under extremely unhealthy or otherwise onerous
 conditions.
 * Given Soviet control over all aspects of life in Latvia, the
 systemic human rights abuses described in the report on the
 U.S.S.R. apply also to Latvia. This report discusses only
 instances of repression specific to Latvia.

 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Soviet legal provisions are written and'interpreted so broadly
 that Latvians may be arrested and convicted for exercising
 basic human rights.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 As in the Soviet Union, Communist Party control of society is
 exercised in political cases to negate constitutional
 guarantees of the objectivity and independence of the judicial
 process. The self-determined compelling needs of the State
 override the rights of a defendant.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Through the use of informers, mail censorship, electronic
 monitoring of telephones, and other devices, government
 authorities have the ability to interfere in every aspect of
 personal life. Constitutional guarantees to the contrary,
 Soviet investigative agencies do not abstain from forced entry
 and illegal searches. Contacts between Latvians and foreign
 visitors are strongly discouraged, and those who indulge in
 such contacts are subject to official harassment.
 Section 2 Respect-for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution provides for most internationally accepted
 political liberties as long as their exercise accords with the
 strengthening and security of the "socialist" system. In
 practice, the authorities do not tolerate freedom of speech
 and press or any dissident behavior. Riga dissident and
 Russian Orthodox activist Mikhail Bombin was under
 investigation at year's end facing possible charges of
 anti-Soviet slander for his unofficial activities in support
 of peaceand detente.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The right of association is provided for in the Constitution,
 but the authorities strictly control all associations and
 organizations. Latvians peacefully celebrating Latvian
 Independence Day are subject to arrest, and foreigners
 visiting their Latvian relatives are frequently interrogated
 and harassed.
 Soviet labor law and practice are enforced in Latvia.
 Although the Constitution guarantees all Soviet citizens the
 right to form trade unions, any efforts by workers to exercise
 this right independently of state-sponsored. and controlled
 unions have been brutally repressed. Given Soviet concern
 that the ideas of the Polish Solidarity trade union movement
 might spread, this has been especially true in the Baltic
 states.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Despite constitutional guarantees, religious activity is the
 subject of systematic official harassment. Jewish cultural
 activist Vladimir Frenkel of Riga was sentenced to 18 months
 in labor camp in June 1985 for writing articles for the Jewish

 LATVIA
 cultural "samizdat" (self-published) journal Khaim, as well as
 for publishing a number of articles on Russian Orthodoxy in
 the West.
 Members of the Roman Catholic, Baptist, and Adventist churches
 also appear to have encountered more difficulties with the
 authorities than the larger Lutheran Church, perhaps because
 of their outspokenness.
 In September 1984, Zofiya Belyarchuk and a colleague named
 Sanderos were arrested for attempting to form a Franciscan
 church group.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Soviet authorities do not respect the right of emigration.
 The granting of permission to emigrate from Latvia is
 .arbitrary and subject to increasing restrictions. The
 authorities harass Latvians whose desire to emigrate is known
 and cause their living conditions to deteriorate in order to
 discourage emigration applications. Two Latvian families are
 currently on the U.S. Government Representation List of
 Divided Families who have been refused Soviet permission to
 join their relatives in the United States. Ninety more
 families are on the U.S. Representation List of Soviet Jews
 denied permission to emigrate to Israel. A number have been
 trying to obtain permission for more than 10 years.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Non-Communist Latvians have almost no opportunity to
 participate meaningfully in the political process. Communist
 Party and governmental authorities in Latvia are severely
 limited in their ability to advance national interests, if
 they should choose to do so. Latvians have the lowest
 proportion of Communist Party membership of the three Baltic
 states and are outnumbered in the local party hierarchy. As
 in other areas under Soviet control, political activity
 outside the Communist Party is not tolerated.
 Expressions of Latvian nationalism continued in 1985. On two
 occasions these led to clashes between Latvian and Russian
 youths in Riga. The first clash reportedly occurred on
 Victory Day, May 9; the second, several days later on Latvian
 Independence Day. The Independence Day disturbances
 apparently took place against the backdrop of a demonstration
 demanding an end to Soviet occupation. Around 300 young
 Latvians were temporarily detained, with injuries and even
 some fatalities reported.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Soviet Government rejects any foreign criticism of its
 human rights record, maintaining that all internationally
 recognized human rights are fully protected. Its attitude
 toward investigation of the human rights situation in Latvia
 is uncompromisingly negative.

 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 Since its annexation, Latvia, with its population of about 2.5
 million, has become an industrial workshop and trading center
 for the Soviet Union. Soviet authorities have emphasized
 investment in heavy industry, and industrial output has
 increased substantially since World War II.
 The process of industrialization was accompanied by a large
 influx of Slavic workers from elsewhere in the Soviet Union
 because of Latvia's small labor force and low birth rate. At
 the same time, Latvian agriculture has been neglected, and
 this has caused periodic shortages of food, particularly meat
 and dairy products, in a country that exported such products
 during independence.
 Latvia's economic performance during the first 6 months of
 1985 was roughly on a par with the Soviet average. Growth in
 industrial production was 3 percent compared with the Soviet
 average of 3.1 percent, and labor productivity rose by 3.2
 percent, well above the Soviet average of 2.6 percent.
 By most measures of economic well-being, Latvia has for
 decades been regarded as better off than most areas in the
 Soviet Union. To some extent, this former prosperity is now
 working against it, as centrally controlled funds are diverted
 to less developed areas in the Soviet Union. The
 deterioration of housing is readily observable, and the same
 phenomenon is said to extend throughout the economic and
 social infrastructure, including roads, schools, institutes,
 hospitals, and even factories.
 The large proportion (about 47 percent) of non-Latvians in the
 population, along with cultural censorship and mandatory
 ideology, has placed the Latvian language and culture in
 jeopardy. Lacking an internal rallying point, such as the
 Roman Catholic Church provides for Lithuanians, or a nearby
 external point of cultural affinity, as Finland is for
 Estonians, Latvians face poor prospects in their efforts to
 preserve and refresh their cultural traditions.
