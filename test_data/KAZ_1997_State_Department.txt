 KAZAHSTAN
 The Constitution of Kazakhstan concentrates power in the p residency. President
 Nursultan Nazarbayev is the dominant political figure. The Constitution, adopted
 
 
 1136
 in 1995 in a referendum marred by irregularities, permits the President to legislate
 by decree and dominate the legislature and judiciary; it cannot be changed or
 amended without the President's consent. Presidential elections originally scheduled
 for 1996 did not take place, as President Nazarbayev's term in office was extended
 to 2000 in a separate 1995 referendum, also marred by irregularities. Under the
 1995 Constitution, Parliament's powers are more limited than previously. However,
 members of Parliament have the right to introduce legislation. During the Par-
 liament's first full session, deputies drafted 19 bills for consideration. The judiciary
 remained under the control of the President and the executive branch. The lack of
 an independent judiciary made it difficult to root out corruption, which was perva-
 sive throughout the Government.
 In October as part of a larger government reorganization, the law enforcement
 community was restructured. The Committee for National Security (the KNB, suc-
 cessor to the KGB) is responsible for counterintelligence and law enforcement activi-
 ties on the national level A new external intelligence service, Barlau (the Kazakh
 word for intelligence), was created to supervise overseas operations. Both report di-
 rectly to the President. The Ministry of Internal affairs supervises the criminal po-
 lice who are poorly paid and widely believed to be corrupt. The State Committee
 for Investigations (0SK), a federal investigative and law enforcement agency estab-
 lished in 1995, was dissolved. Its functions were divided between the Interior Min-
 istry and the KNB. The KNB continued efforts to legitimize its role by focusing on
 activities to combat terrorism and organized crime. Members of the security forces
 committed human rights abuses.
 Kazakhstan is rich in natural resources, chiefly petroleum and minerals. The Gov-
 ernment has made significant progress toward a market-based economy since inde-
 pendence. After a 5-year decline, overall production began to increase in 1996. The
 Government has been successful in stabilizing the local currency (tenge), slowing in-
 flation, and improving structural reforms. The agricultural sector, traditionally ac-
 counting for over one-third of national employment and production, has been slow
 to privatize. The Government successfully privatized most small- and medium-size
 firms, and is working to privatize large-scale industrial complexes, particularly in
 the oil and gas sector. However, living standards for many citizens continue to de-
 cline. According to several surveys, up to 35 percent of citizens live below the gov-
 ernment-defimed poverty line of $50 per month.
 The Government generally respected the human rights of its citizens in some
 areas, but serious problems remain in others. Democratic institutions are weak. The
 Government infringed on citizens' right to change their government. The legal struc-
 ture, including the Constitution adopted in 1995, does not fully safeguard human
 rights. Members of the security forces often beat or otherwise abused detainees, and
 harsh prison conditions continued to deteriorate. There were allegations of arbitrary
 arrest, and prolonged detention is a problem. The Judiciary remains under the con-
 trol of the President and the executive branch, and corruption is deeply rooted. The
 Government infringed on citizens' rights to privacy. The Government generally tol-
 erates independent media, although the media practiced self-censorship, and the
 Government maintained control of most printing presses and facilities. Freedom of
 assembly was sometimes restricted. Some organizers of unsanctioned demonstra-
 tions were arrested and fined or imprisoned. Freedom of association, while generally
 respected, was sometimes hinderedby complicated and controversial registration re-
 quirements for organizations and political parties that restrict this right. Domestic
 violence against women remained a problem. There was discrimination against
 women, the disabled, and ethnic minorities. The Government discriminated in favor
 of ethnic Kazakhs. The Government tried to limit the influence of independent trade
 unions, both directly and through its support for state-sponsored unions, and mem-
 bers of independent trade unions were harassed.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political
 killings.
 There were credible reports that a few detainees died due to mistreatment during
 interrogation by the security forces (see Section 1.c.). In January according to the
 Russian Center (an ethnic Russian political movement), a young man taken into
 tod  for public drunkenness was killed while in detention in Almaty. The
 Kazastan International Bureau on Human Rights (formerly the Kazakhstan-
 American Bureau on Human Rights) reported that in February a man who was
 taken into custody for public drunkenness was beaten to death while in custody in
 
 
 1137
 Talgar. In July the press reported that the GSK officer responsible was convicted
 of murder and sentenced to 9 years in prison.
 In May a chief of criminal investigations in the State Committee for Investiga-
 tions in Zhambyl, who was charged with the death of a detainee under his authority
 in December 1995, was sentenced to 15 years in prison. In September the verdict
 and sentence were upheld by the Supreme Court.
 The Government acknowledged that more than a thousand inmates died due to
 disease mainly tuberculosis, aggravated by harsh prison conditions and inadequate
 medical treatment (see Section 1.c.). Human rights monitors believe that the total
 was more than twice this number.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution states that "no one must be subject to torture, violence or other
 treatment and punishment that is cruel or humiliating to human dignity." However,
 there were credible reports that police beat or treated detainees abusively to obtain
 confessions. Human rights observers report that detainees are sometimes choked,
 handcuffed to radiators, or have plastic bags placed over their heads to force them
 to divulge information. Training standards for police are very low and individual
 law enforcement officials are often poorly supervised. In June opposition leader
 Madel Ismailov alleged that he was deprived of sleep, forced to stand for hours, and
 housed in substandard, crowded conditions after he was arrested for organizing an
 unauthorized demonstration against a government decision to approve a hike in
 electricity rates (see Section 2.b.).
 There are credible reports that a few detainees died as a result of mistreatment
 during police interrogations in January and February (see Section L.a.).
 Petr Svoik, one of the leaders of the political opposition movement Azamat, al-
 leged that government authorities arranged for four unidentified assailants to break
 into his hoel room in Bisbkek, Kyrgyzstan on December 1 and beat him with clubs
 as a warning to Azamat after he organized an unsanctioned November 30 dem-
 onstration. Svoik reportedly suffered minor injuries, none of which required medical
 attention. Official government comments expressed sympathy for Svoik as a victim
 of violence and President Nazarbayev asked the Minister of Internal Affairs to work
 with Kyrgy authorities to find Svoik's assailants. No arrests have been made in the
 case (see  tion 1.d.).
 Army personnel subjected conscripts to brutal hazing, including beatings and
 verbal abuse. In August the military Prosecutor General estimated that one of every
 nine crimes in the army was concealed by senior military commanders. He reported
 that there were 60 cases of death due to mistreatment in the army in 1996; as of
 April, 20 cases of death due to mistreatment had been reported.
 %rison conditions were harsh and continued to deteriorate, due to diminishing re-
 sources. In 1996 the Minister of Interior noted that $64.3 million (4.5 billion tenge)
 was needed to support the prison population, but only $37.1 million (1.9 billion
 tenge) was allocated by the Government. The Kazakhstan International Bureau for
 Human Rights estimated that the same amount would be needed to support the
 prison population in 1997, but that again only 45 to 50 percent of that amount
 would be allocated by the Government-about $33.3 million (2.5 billion tenge). The
 Government allocated $37.7 million (2.6 billion tenge) for prisons in 1997 and $68
 million (5.1 billion tenge) for prisons in 1998. The Government, however, faced a
 large budget deficit, and it was uncertain whether the prisons would actually re-
 ceive the money allocated in the budget. In July the Ministry of Interior reported
 that there were 68,000 persons in prison and another 15,000 in detention in facili-
 ties designed to hold 60,000. Local human rights activists agreed with the Govern-
 ment's figures. In October the-press reported that 10 prisoners in a maximum secu-
 rity prison in Aktyubinsk cut open their stomachs to protest the prison administra-
 tion's refusal to abolish separate zones for different categories of prisoners. The pris-
 oners also demanded the dismissal of the prison's administration and improvement
 of conditions in the prison.
 Overcrowding, combined with an inadequate prison diet and a lack of medical
 supplies and personnel, contributed to tuberculosis, hepatitis, and other diseases. In
 July the Government reported that more than 20 percent of all inmates suffered
 from tuberculosis. The n     ion   Human Rights Bureau's estimate is slightly
 higher-at least 30 percent of all inmates suffer from tuberculosis and other major
 illnesses. The Government also acknowledged that AIDS is becoming a concern.
 Prison guards, who are poorly paid, steal food and medicines intended for prisoners.
 In July the Government reported that 1,122 inmates imprisoned under harsh con-
 ditions with inadequate medical treatment had died of disease, 770 of them from
 tuberculosis. Human rights monitors estimated the number of those who died from
 disease while imprisoned at more than twice that number.
 
 
 1138
 Violent crime among prisoners is common.
 The Government reported that a 1996 amnesty reduced the number of prisoners
 significantly. Although no official figures are available, the Kazakhstan Inter-
 national Bureau on Human Rights estimates that between 5,500 and 11,000 persons
 were amnestied.
 Prisoners are allowed one 4-hour visit every 3 months, but additional visits may
 be granted in emergency situations. Some prisoners are eligible for 3-day visits witY
 close relatives once every 6 months. Juveniles are kept in separate facilities.
 The Government was reluctant to work with local human rights groups to im-
 prove prison conditions. However, a representative of the domestic nongovernmental
 organization (NGO) The International Bureau on Human Rights was permitted to
 visit prisons for juveniles and women in Almaty. In the past, the Government has
 permitted international groups to visit prisons, most recently a U.N. study group
 in December 1996.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Local human rights organizations alleged
 that the Government used minor infractions of the law or manufactured charges to
 arrest and detain government opponents arbitrarily. In February law enforcement
 authorities charged independent trade union leader Leonid Solomin with violating
 currency laws and a constitutional provision barring trade unions from receiving fi-
 nancial assistance from a foreign source (see Section 6.a.). In June two leaders of
 the Worker's Movement (a Communist party fringe group), Madel Ismailov and
 Yuriy Vinkov, and the leader of the National Pensioner's Movement, Nina
 Savostina, were arrested and jailed after organizing a peaceful, unsanctioned dem-
 onstration in May in front of the Parliament to protest government approval of an
 electricity rate hike (see Section 2.b.). In December the three cochairmen of the
 Azamat political opposition movement were questioned by authorities after they or-
 ganized a peaceful, unsanctioned demonstration in front of the parliament building
 in Almaty to protest a March 1995 presidential decree requiring demonstrators to
 obtain permits for public meetings. Petr Svoik, who alleged that he was beaten in
 Bishkek at the behest of Kazakhstani authorities, received a warning from the Gov-
 ernment; Marat Auezov was summoned to the local district court, fined $33 (2,480
 tenge), and released; and Galim Abilseitov was arrested and sentenced to 15 days
 in prison (Abilseitov served 7 days before he was released) (see Section 2.b.). Petr
 Svoik, who was arrested and fined for organizing unsansctioned demonstrations in
 late 1996 in Almaty, was still under investigation for taking a portable computer
 used during his tenure as the head of the State Antimonopoly Committee.
 The law sanctions pretrial detention. According to the Constitution, police may
 hold a detainee for 72 hours before bringing charges. In May the Aktau city prosecu-
 tor's office reported that 2,500 people had been detained in 1996 on suspicion of
 being involved in a crime; most were released after a few hours. According to the
 law, after 72 hours police may continue to hold a detainee for 10 days with the ap-
 proval of a prosecutor. However, in practice police routinely hold detainees, with the
 sanction of a prosecutor, for weeks or even months without bringing charges. In Au-
 gust the Deputy Prosecutor General publicly acknowledged that prolonged deten-
 tions-especially those intended to force a detainee to confess to a crime-were a
 serious problem.
 In June legislation signed into law by the President formally established a system
 of bail that permits those charged with a crime and awaiting trial to request the
 judge to approve bail. During the same month, the leaders of the Azamat political
 opposition movement posted a $1,334 (100,000 tenge) bail for detained Worker's
 Movement leader Madel Ismailov, who was then released.
 The law stipulates that the maximum length of pretrial detention is 2 months,
 although the length of pretrial detention can be extended up to 1 year, with the ap-
 proval of the Prosecutor General. The Prosecutor General claims that between 70
 and 80 percent of those accused of a crime are considered to be eligible for bail; how-
 ever, the International Human Rights Bureau believes that the percentage of ac-
 cused persons who actually obtain bail is small.
 According to the Constitution, every person detained, arrested, or accused of com-
 mitting a crime has the right to the assistance of a defense lawyer from the moment
 of detention, arrest, or accusation. This right is generally respected in practice.
 However, human rights activists allege that members of the security forces have
 pressured prisoners to refuse the assistance of an attorney, sometimes resulting in
 a delay before the accused sees a lawyer. Detainees may also appeal the legality of
 detention or arrest to the prosecutor before trial. If the defendant cannot affordan
 attorney, the Constitution provides that the State must provide one free of charge.
 Human rights organizations allege that many prisoners are unaware of this provi-
 sion of the law. Although some lawyers are reluctant to defend clients unpopular
 
 
 1139
 with the Government, there were no reports of attorneys being sanctioned by the
 Government for their decisions to defend particular clients.
 The Government does not use forced exile.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-Government interference and pressure com-
 premised the court system's independence throughout 1997-a situation codified in
 the Constitution's establishment of a judiciary fully under the control of the Presi-
 dent and the executive branch. The Government continued the process of restructur-
 ing the judicial system to bring it conformity with provisions of the Constitution.
 There are three levels in the court system: local; oblast (provincial); and the Su-
 preme Court. According to the Constitution, the President proposes to the upper
 house of Parliament (the Senate) nominees for the Supreme Court (recommended
 by the Supreme Judicial Council, a body chaired by the President, which includes
 tehairperson of the Constitutional Council, the chairperson of the Supreme
 Court, the Prosecutor General, the Minister of Justice, senators, judges and'other
 persons appointed by the President). The President appoints oblast judges (nomi-
 nated by the Highest Judicial Council) and local level judges from a list presented
 by the Ministry of Justice, based on recommendations from the Qualification Colle-
 Sunm of Justice, an autonomous institution made up of deputies from the lower
 ouse of Parliament (the Majilis), judges, public prosecutors, and others appointed
 by the President.
 According to legislation passed in December 1996, judges are appointed for life,
 although in practice this means until mandatory retirement at age 65. The 1995
 Constitution abolished the Constitutional Court and established a Constitutional
 Council- three of its seven members, -including the chairman, are directly appointed
 by the President. The Council rules on election and referendum challenges, inter-
 p rets the Constitution, and determines the constitutionality of laws adopted by Par-
 liament. Under the Constitution, citizens no longer have the right to appeal directly
 to a court about the constitutionality of a government action; this appea is now the
 sole prerogative nf the courts. The Constitution states that "if a court finds that a
 law or other regulatory legal act subject to application undermined the rights and
 liberties of an individual and a citizen, it shall suspend legal proceedings and ad-
 dress the Constitutional Council with a proposal to declare the law unconstitu-
 tional," but does not grant citizens the right to approach the courts on a constitu-
 tional issue.
 Local courts try less serious crimes, such as petty theft and vandalism. Oblast
 courts handle more serious crimes, such as murder, grand theft, and organized
 criminal activities. The oblast courts may also handle cases in rural areas where
 no local courts are organized. Judgments of the local courts may be appealed to the
 oblast-level courts, while those of the oblast courts may be appealed to the Supreme
 Court. There is also a military court. Although they do not currently exist, special-
 ized and extraordinary courts can also be created-for example, economic, taxation,
 family, juvenile, and administrative courts-which have the status of oblast and
 local courts.
 The Constitution and the law establish the necessary procedures for a fair trial.
 Trials are public, with the exception of instances in which an open hearing could
 result in state secrets being divulged, or when the private life or personal family
 concerns of a citizen must be protected.
 According to the Constitution, defendants have the right to be present, the right
 to counsel (at public expense if needed), and the right to be heard in court and call
 witnesses for the defense. Defendants enjoy a presumption of innocence, are pro-
 tected from self-incrimination, and have the right to appeal a decision to a higher
 court. Legal proceedings are to be conducted in the state language, Kazakh, al-
 though Russian may afso be used officially in the courts. Proceedings also may be
 held in the language of the majority of the population in a particular area.
 In most cases, these rights are respecte. However, in December Azamat political
 opposition movement cochairman Galim Abilseitov was arrested, taken to district
 court, and charged with organizing an unsanctioned rally on November 30.
 Abilseitov stated that he was not permitted to have a public trial. He was not per-
 mitted to have a lawyer present; nor was he permitted to offer testimony in his own
 defense. The judge sentenced Abilseitov to 15 days in prison. Abilseitov was released
 from prison 7 days later, after the district prosecutor general upheld his complaint
 that the trial had been illegal. The court did not pursue the case further (see Sec-
 tion 2.b.).
 The problem of corruption is evident at every stage and level of the judicial proc-
 ess. Judges are poorly paid; the Government has not made a vigorous effort to root
 out corruption in the judiciary. According to press reports, judicial positions can be
 purchased. Anecdotal evidence stemming from individual cases suggests that judges
 solicit bribes from participants in trials and rule accordingly. In May 1996, the Gov-
 
 
 1140
 ernment instituted a new procedure that requires all judges to go through a recer-
 tification process. The process was intended to ensure that judges are familiar with
 current law and was completed in the fall. Judges were required to pass an oral
 examination. The recertification process resulted in a significant turnover of person-
 nel, particularly at the lower levels. The recertification process addressed a legiti-
 mate need to improve judicial competence; however, it was used in some cases by
 local governments to remove individual judges for political reasons.
 The Government is in the process of reforming the legal system. In June the Par-
 liament passed new criminal and civil codes to bring the legal system into accord
 with the Constitution. However, much of the old Soviet legal structure remained in
 force while the Government drafted the necessary implementing regulations. Al-
 though human rights organizations acknowledged that the new criminal code was
 a step forward, they raised a number of concerns regarding the code's effect on indi-
 vidual political and civic rights. The new code extends the maximum term of impris-
 onment from 15 to 30 years limits the use of the death penalty, and gives judges
 and law enforcement officials more flexibility in determining appropriate charges.
 Previously, after a certain number of civil code violations, a defendant would auto-
 matically be charged with a criminal offense. The new code also eliminates a num-
 ber of legal holdovers from the Soviet period, including public condemnation as a
 punishment, enforcement of restrictive passport regulations, and prosecution for va-
 grancy or a parasitic way of life.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution provides that citizens have the right to "confidentiality of personal de-
 posits and savings, correspondence, telephone conversations, postal, telegraph and
 other messages." Limitation of this right is allowed "only in the cases and according
 to the procedure directly established by law." However, the KNB and Ministy of
 Internal Affairs, with the concurrence of the General Prosecutor's office, can and do
 arbitrarily interfere with privacy, family, home, and correspondence. The law re-
 quires criminal police, who remain part of the internal security structure, to obtain
 a search warrant from a prosecutor before conducting a search, but they sometimes
 search without a warrant. The KNB has the right to monitor telephone calls and
 mail, but under the law it must inform the General Prosecutor's office within 24
 hours of such activity.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution and the 1991 Press Law pro-
 vide for freedom of the press, and the Government generally tolerates independent
 media. The Government continued to own and control most printing and distribu-
 tion facilities and to subsidize periodicals, including many that were supposedly
 independent. The potential for government control and instances of official pressure
 resulted in widespread media self-censorship. The key subject considered to be "off
 limits" by journalists was personal criticism of the President and government offi-
 cials.
 In February the editor and staff of the weekly newspaper Economika Segodnya
 were questioned at length about an article in the newspaper that quoted an opposi-
 tion leader criticizing the President. The newspaper had previously been cited by
 the government mass media agency for not including in its masthead all the infor-
 mation required by government regulation. The newspaper was warned that one
 more citation would result in the suspension of its business license.
 There were two cases in northern Kaastan in which local administration cen-
 sorship offices accused independent stations of violating local laws after they had
 aired programs that were objectionable to the Government. No further action was
 taken against either station.
 Despite such official heavy-handedness, the press was generally permitted to criti-
 cize government decisions. Official corruption remained an acceptable topic for criti-
 cal coverage. Many journalists criticize the Parliament as being without power and
 subject to the President's control.
 In January the press reported that the Government closed the independent daily
 newspaper, Karavan Blitz, which was very critical of the Prime Minister. However,
 the newspaper's owner announced that he had ceased publication because the news-
 paper was not profitable. The owner also publishes the weekly tabloid-style Cara-
 van, the most popular newspaper in the country, which routinely criticizes the Gov-
 ernment and offers political views and commentary.
 Most political opposition groups freely issued their own publications. There are
 several independent newspapers that reflect opposition views, particularly Delovaya
 Nedelya (Business Week) and Twenty-first Century. However, in June the Govern-
 ment closed the Communist Party's national newspaper when it applied for rereg-
 
 
 1141.
 istration, alleging that the newspaper had violated the Constitution by calling for
 the violent overthrow of the social system. It is unclear whether this charge was
 accurate. The newspaper responded that it had only discussed the reform of the so-
 cial system and attempted to sue the National Agency on Press and Mass Media
 for about $26,667 (2,000,000 tenge). However, the courts refused to hear the case
 and the newspaper remains closed.
 There are 31 independent radio and television stations. Eleven of these are in
 Almaty. In November 1996, there were 57 independent stations in the country; eight
 were in Almaty. Of the 26 stations that went out of business in 1997, half closed
 due to the frequencies auctions. The other 13 went bankrupt before the auctions
 began or joined forces with other broadcasting companies to compete in the auctions.
 There are only two government-owned combined radio and television companies.
 However, they represent five channels and are the only stations that can broadcast
 nationwide. Regional governments own several frequencies; however, independent
 broadcasters have arranged with local administrations to use the majority of these.
 The Government controls nearly all broadcasting transmission facilities. About 40
 percent of newspapers are government-owned. All daily newspapers are govern-
 ment-run. There are also a large number of newspapers that are produced y gov-
 ernment ministries, for example, Kazakhstan Science, published by the Ministry of
 Science. However, many newspapers receive a government subsidy. All Kazakh lan-
 guage newspapers receive a government subsidy, although most would call them-
 selves independents. Therefore, including newspapers that receive subsidies, about
 80 percent of newspapers are government-ron. Each major population center has at
 least one independent weekly newspaper. There are seven ma or independent news-
 aers in Almaty. An Association of Independent Electronic Meda of Central Asia
 (ANESM1) exists, but it is fractured and weak.
 An auction of television and radio frequencies convinced many human rights ac-
 tivists and some media outlets that the Government sought to harass and even
 eliminate independent media. The Government denied any intent to limit free
 speech and asserted that it was acting in its own fiscal interest. The Government
 had announced the tender for frequencies in Almaty in December 1996. Prior to the
 frequencies auction, there was no formal process for obtaining a frequency. Some
 stations simply assumed ownership at no cost; others obtained frequencies through
 the good offices of local officials, often accomplished through bribery. The majority
 of independent media outlets in Almaty participated in the auction. Some joined
 with other broadcasting companies or commercial backers to raise the necessary
 capital. Others protested the auction vehemently, but still participated. The results
 of the Almaty frequencies auction were announced in January. Two television/radio
 companies and one radio company (which carried the Voice of America) lost the auc-
 tion and were removed from the airwaves. The two television/radio companies that
 lost the auction were the most vocal critics of the Government in the media. How-
 ever, there was no change in the total number of independent Almaty television sta-
 tions. Two new stations replaced the two losers. In radio there was a net increase
 of one independent broadcaster. Some of the new stations established as a result
 of the frequencies auction offer political news and commentary and criticism of the
 Government; others do not.
 The situation was very different in the subsequent frequencies auction for the
 Srovinces (oblasts). Fewbroadcasters could meet the minimum bid required by the
 Government. In addition the Government announced that no frequencies would be
 awarded in areas in which there were not at least two bidders. In April the Govern-
 ment awarded three television and five radio frequencies in seven cities. Many of
 the losing stations claimed that the winners received frequencies because they
 promised to be loyal to the Government. At the end of the auction, ANEMSI de-
 clared that no real independent media existed in Kazakhstan. In fact only a small
 number of stations lost their frequencies in the auctions, although many were forced
 to find commercial backers and to relinquish financial control over their stations.
 Although many of the commercial backers have ties or connections to the Govern-
 ment, there are few reports of broadcasters being pressured by commercial backers
 in order to please the Government. One station reported that it was pressured by
 one of its owners not to broadcast information about an unauthorized demonstration
 in order to ensure that the local administration did not close the station and cut
 off advertising revenues. Commercial backers are more likely to pressure stations
 to air more high-profit programs such as westerns, rather than low-profit offerings
 of news and political commentary. The total number of independent stations operat-
 ing decreased, however, many stations ceased broadcasting before the auctions
 began. Others elected not to participate in the auctions and closed voluntarily.
 Overall, the tender process was flawed. The rules were complex and sometimes
 contradictory. Although the tender award committee was eventually expanded to in-
 
 
 1142
 clude a mass media representative, the process was not transparent. According to
 government officials, the minimum bid was based on a cost formulation used for fre-
 quencies in Australia. Bids varied based on the power of the station and other tech-
 nical parameters, but the commonly used figure for Almaty was $126,000. This ap-
 proach priced many independents out of the market, especially in the provinces
 where advertising revenue is low. The Government also did not require its television
 and radio companies to compete in the auction and reserved the highest quality and
 the most desirable frequencies for them.
 In March ANESMI filed an inquiry with the Prosecutor General regarding the le-
 gality of the frequencies auctions. The Prosecutor's Office ruled that the law upon
 which the auction was based was unconstitutional. The Prosecutor asked the Prime
 Minister for a response to the ruling, but none was given. The Prosecutor's Office
 did not directly address the legality of the auctions themselves. There was no fur-
 ther action taken on the ANESMI protest. According to the law, if the Government
 does not respond to a prosecutor's rulin , the Prosecutor General's office can take
 the Government to court. In this case, tlge Prosecutor General's officer took no fur-
 ther action. None of the losing stations went to court to protest the loss of their fre-
 quencies. Most believed that it was too expensive and not worthwhile to try. There
 is no procedure in the law to appeal the loss of a tender.
 Some members of the independent media alleged that the January murder of a
 foreign expert providing technical assistance to the independent media during the
 debate over the frequencies auctions was part of a political campaign against the
 independent media. However, the murderers were arrested and convicted in June
 and evidence presented during the trial confirmed that the motive for the murder
 was robbery.
 The Constitution provides for the protection of the dignity of the President and
 the law against insulting the President and other officials remained on the books.
 Although no cases of insulting the President or other officials were reported in the
 press, the Kazakhstan International Bureau on Human Rights alleged that there
 were numerous cases of individuals arrested for insulting local officials. The bureau
 reported that in September, three youths in Uralsk, Ainur Kurmanov, Sergey
 Kolokolov, and Vasya Nikolayev, were arrested and charged under five separate
 statutes of the new Criminal Code for writing antipresidential graffiti on the walls
 of a building in May. Conviction could carry a prison sentence of 3 to 8 years. The
 youths originally were arrested and charged with the minor offense of hooliganism
 (a crime that no longer exists under the Criminal Code passed in June), and re-
 leased. However, in accordance with a June decree reiterating the importance of
 protecting the honor and dignity of the President, the Government ordered Uralsk
 authorities to arrest the youths and take them into custody. The case remains open.
 Two of the youths are in custody; one is not being held because he is a minor. The
 case was scheduled to go to trial on December 22, however, one of the defendants,
 Ainur Kurmanov, who was on a 23-day hunger strike to protest his imprisonment,
 was too ill to stand trial. The court postponed the trial until January 19, 1998.
 Prominent opposition leaders, including Yuriy Vinkov of the Labor Movement, a
 Communist parliamentary deputy from Uralsk, Valeriy Zemliyanov, and the co-
 chairmen of the Azamat political movement, are supporting the youths.
 Several laws control advertising in the mass media. One law restricts alcohol and
 tobacco advertising on television, as well as "pornography" and "violence" during
 prime viewing hours. Another law restricts the amount of advertising in newspapers
 to 20 percent of the total material in each issue. The Minister of Justice and the
 Minister of Press and Mass Media have interpreted this law as restricting paid arti-
 cles, but not commercial advertisements.
 The Government respects academic freedom.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 peaceful assembly; however, the Government and the law impose significant restric-
 tions. According to the law, organizations must apply to the local authorities for a
 permit to hold a demonstration or public meeting at least 10 days in advance, or
 the activity is considered illegal. In some cases, local officials routinely issued nec-
 essary permits. However, human rights activists complained that complicated proce-
 dures and the 10-day notification period made it difficult for all groups to organize
 public meetings and demonstrations. They argue that local authorities, especially
 those outside of the capital, turned down the majority of applications submitted or
 refused to allow rallies to take place in central locations. According to the press,
 local authorities refused to issue permits for public meetings in Shymkent and
 Zhambyl because of the "danger of epidemics arising among large groups of people."
 In September the Kazakhstan International Bureau on Human Rights reported that
 local authorities in Uralsk refused to issue a permit to a Communist Party par-
 liamentary deputy who wanted to organize a public meeting with his constituents.

 In January the President announced a "year of political accord" and asked politi-
 cal and social movements to agree to a 1-year moratorium on political actions. Al-
 though many state-supported organizations agreed, most independent organizations
 refused. In March the Prosecutor General referred to unsanctioned gatherings in
 which top officials were slandered and defamed-an offense under the law-when
 he warned that the Government would not tolerate unauthorized public meetings,
 strikes, or the release of inflammatory public statements. He pledged to take "all
 necessary actions" to atop illegal activities.
 Nevertheless, there were numerous peaceful, unsanctioned demonstrations of
 workers and pensioners protesting difficult economic conditions and the nonpayment
 of wages and pensions. or  e most part, law enforcement authorities did not inter-
 fere in the demonstrations, and no action was taken against the individuals partici-
 pating. There  were peaceful unsanctioned  demonstrations in Kentau, Ust-
 Kamenogorsk, and Alxnaty in which no arrests were made. In September the
 Azamat political opposition movement issued a statement that "demonstrative re-
 prisals" (warnings) had been issued by the Government to the organizers of illegal
 protest actions in Karaganda, Pavlodar, Kokchetau, and Uralsk.
 However, there were also cases in which the Government arrested, detained,
 freed, and sometimes imprisoned the individual organizers of unsanctioned rallies.
 In March several Communist Party members were arrested and fined for protesting
 the dissolution of the Soviet Union. Also in March, after an unsanctioned dem-
 onstration to protest economic conditions in Almaty, three members of the Alash
 Party alleged that they were arrested and frned for carrying banners with
 antigovernment slogans. Madel Ismaiov, leader of the Workers Movement (a Com-
 munist Party fringe group), was arrested for organizing an unsanctioned May 1
 demonstration in Almaty. Ismailov obtained a permit from city officials to hold a
 rally in a park in the city. However, after the rally began, Ismalov led protesters
 to the office of the head of the local administration. After the demonstration con-
 cluded, Ismailov was arrested and sentenced to 15 days in prison.
 In June Ismailov and another Worker's Movement member, Yuriy Vinkov, and the
 leader of the National Pensioner's Movement, Nina Savostina, were arrested after
 organizing an unsanctioned demonstration on May 30 in front of Parliament to pro-
 test government approval of a utility rate hike. Savostina and Vinkov were sen-
 tenced to 7-day and 15-day jail terms respectively for organizing the demonstration.
 Ismaiov was charged with "active participation in or organization of public dis-
 order," an offense that carries a possible sentence of 3 years in jail, andl detained.
 He was released from prison on bail in July after his trial began. In September
 Ismaiov was found guilty and sentenced by the district court to 1 year of "corrective
 labor." In fact, however, this sentence amounted to a fine for Ismailov, an employee
 of a government seismic control station, as the Government garnished 15 percent
 of his wages each month. The judge took into account the 30 days Ismailov had
 spent in detention and ruled that each day spent in custody would be equal to 3
 days of "corrective labor." Therefore, Ismailov would be required to serve only 9
 months of "corrective labor." Ismailov, who continues to argue his innocence, ap-
 pealed the conviction and sentence to the oblast-level court (see Section 1.d.). Tle
 court has not yet acted upon Ismailov's ap ppeal.
 Also in June, 400 pensioners in Pavlodar clashed with police during an
 unsanctioned demonstration to protest economic conditions. The press alleged that
 tear gas and force were used to disperse the crowd; local officials denied the allega-
 tions. The organizer of the rally, the head of the local pensioner's movement, was
 arrested and sentenced to 15 days in prison. In July two leaders of a miners' union
 in Karaganda were arrested for organizing an unsanctioned demonstration to 1ro-
 test the nonpayment of wages. The two were sentenced to jail terms, but the ruling
 was overturned by the district court; they were fined and released.
 On November 30, the political opposition groups Azamat and the Worker's Move-
 ment held an unauthorized demonstration in front of the parliament building in
 Almaty to protest a March 1995 presidential decree requiring demonstrators to ob-
 tain permits for demonstrations. The opposition groups claim that the decree is un-
 constitutional, in that it contradicts the August 1995 Constitution, which provides
 for freedom of assembly and peaceful demonstration. The orderl y ront was attended
 by about 500 persons and lasted approximately 1 hour. The three Azamat cochar-
 men who organized the rally were arrested by the Government. Petr Svoik, who also
 alleged that he was beaten on December 1 in Bishek at the behest of Kazakhstani
 authorities, received a warning from the Government; Marat Auezov was summoned
 to the local district court, fined $33 (2,480 tenge), and released; and Galim
 Abilseitov was arrested and sentenced to 15 days in prison (Abilseitov served 7 days
 before he was released) (see Sections 1.e., 1.d., and i.e.).

 The Constitution provides for freedom of association; however, the Government
 and the law impose significant restrictions. Organizations, movements, and political
 parties that conduct public activities, that hold public meetings, participate in con-
 ferences, or have bank accounts must register with the Government. Registration
 on the local level requires a minimum of 10 members and on the national level, a
 minimum of 10 members in at least 7 of the 14 oblasts. In addition a registration
 fee is required, which many groups consider to be a deterrent to registration.
 The Constitution prohibits political parties established on a religious basis. The
 Government has refused to register ethnic-based political parties on the grounds
 that their activities could spark ethnic violence. The Constitution bans "public asso-
 ciations--including political parties-whose "goals or actions are directed at a vio-
 lent change of the Constitutional system, violation of the integrity of the republic,
 undermimng of the security of the state (and), fanning of social, racial, national, re-
 ligious, class and tribal enmity." Unregistered parties and movements, nonetheless,
 hold meetings and publish newspapers. All of the major religious and ethnic groups
 have independently functioning cultural centers.
 To participate in elections, a political party must register with the Government.
 Under current law, a party must submit a list of at least 3,000 members from a
 minimum of 7 oblasts. The list must provide personal information about members,
 including date and place of birth, address, and place of employment. For many citi-
 zens, submitting such personal data to the Government is reminiscent of the tactics
 of the former Soviet KGB and inhibits them from joining parties. The nationalist
 Alash Party and the Social Democratic Party have refused to register on the prin-
 ciple that they should not have to submit personal information about their members
 to the Government. Under the law, members of unregistered parties may run for
 elected office as individuals, but not as party members.
 There are no statistics available regarding the number of registered political par-
 ties (approximately 25 registered nationwide), however, all parties requesting reg-
 istration have been successful. In _general political parties are very weak, and with
 the exception of the Communist Party and some of the ethnically based political
 movements, they have very little influence outside the capital with membership esti-
 mated at about 100,000. The majority of parliamentary deputies are independents;
 they are active in Parliament, but most support the President and the Government.
 Parties represented in the Parliament include several propresidential parties, the
 Communist Party, and the Socialist Party. Most opposition party members decided
 not to participate in the December 1995 elections and are therefore not represented
 in the Parliament.
 The Constitution prohibits foreign political parties and foreign trade unions from
 operating. In addition the Constitution prohibits the financing of political 'parties
 and trade unions by foreign legal entities and citizens, foreign states, and inter-
 national organizations. In March independent trade union leader Leonid Solomin
 was accused of violating the Constitution by accepting financial support from the
 AFL-CIO's Free Trade Union Institute (see Section 6.a.). Some trade union associa-
 tions have circumvented this prohibition by registering with the Government as
 "public organizations," in other words, nongovernmental organizations.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the
 various denominations worship without government interference. However, the Con-
 stitution also requires that the appointment by foreign religious centers of the heads
 of religious associations must be carried out "in coordination with the Government,"
 as must the activities of foreign religious associations. In practice the Government
 does not interfere with the appointment of religious leaders or the activities of for-
 eign religious associations. Foreign missionaries, unwelcome to some Orthodox and
 Muslim citizens, have complained of occasional harassment by low-level government
 officials. In particular evangelical Protestants working as teachers and medical pro-
 fessionals have alleged government hostility toward their efforts to proselytize. How-
 ever, no action has been taken against foreign missionaries working in the country.
 There were allegations that the political harassment of trade union leader Leonid
 Solomin (see Section 6.b.) was directly related to his Jewish faith. Union members
 were reportedly told that they had "sold themselves to the Jew Solomin." However,
 Solomin said publicly that the harassment was because of his trade union activities,
 not his religion.
 The Islamic mufti and the Russian Orthodox archbishop appeared together pub-
 licly to promote religious and ethnic harmony, usually at the invitation of and with
 the President.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Constitution provides for the right to emigrate andthe right of re-
 patriation; both are respected in practice. Kazakhstanis have the right to change
 their citizenship, but are not permitted to hold dual citizenship.
 
 
 1145
 
 According to the Constitution, everyone who is legally present on the territory of
 the Republic has the right to move freely on its territory and freely choose a place
 of residence except in cases stipulated by law. This provision formally abolishes the
 "propiska" system of residence permits, a holdover from the Soviet era, and replaces
 it with a system of registration. However, in practice, citizens are still required to
 register in order to prove legal residence and obtain city services. Registration in
 most of the country was generally routine, but it was difficult to register in Almaty
 due to its relative affluence. The Government can refuse to register a citizen, just
 as it did under the propiska system, in order to limit the number of persons who
 can move to a certain city or area.
 There were a few reports of government efforts to restrict the movement of for-
 eigners around the country. Internal visas are no longer required for foreigners trav-
 eling outside the capital.
 An exit visa is required for both citizens and foreigners who wish to travel abroad,
 although refusals are rare. There have been reports of some officials demanding
 bribes for exit visas. It is usually necessary to meet a number of bureaucratic re-
 quirements before the exit visa is issued. For example close relatives with a claim
 to support from the applicant must give their concurrence. Intending emigrants
 must also obtain evidence that they have no outstanding financial obligations.
 The Government accords special treatment to ethnic Kazakhs and their families
 who fled during Stalin's era and wish to return. Kazakhs in this category are enti-
 tled to citizenship and many other privileges. Anyone else, including ethnic Kazakhs
 who are not considered refugees from the Stalin era of political repression, such as
 the descendants of Kazakhs who moved to Mongolia durin the previous century,
 must apply for permission to return, but it is the stated policy of the Government
 to encourage and assist all ethnic Kazakhs living outside the country to return, if
 they so desire.
 The Government cooperates with the United Nations High Commissioner for Ref-
 ugees (UNHCR) and other humanitarian organizations in assisting refugees, espe-
 cially with the resettlement of ethnic Kazakhs from Afghanistan living as refugees
 in Iran. There were no reports of forced expulsion of refugees; however, in April the
 Afghan Charge d'Affaires publicly appealed to the Government not to expel Afghan
 refugees. None were forced to leave. There were complaints that the Government
 had not yet adopted laws regularizingthe status of refugees. According to the law,
 only ethnic Kazakh repatriates can be considered refugees. Migrants from other
 Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) countries are not considered to be refu-
 gees as they may travel and settle freely in any CIS country. All non-CIS citizens
 are considered to be intending immigrants. In practice, however, the Government
 is tolerant in its treatment of local refugee populations. Political asylum can be
 granted only by the President. The issue of the provision of first asylum has arisen,
 but the Government has not passed legislation and implementing procedures in con-
 formity with internationally recognized norms.
 In December the Parliament passed a migration law. The UNHCR believes that
 the law is a positive first step toward establishing procedures for the Government
 to cope with migration-related problems. The law, based on a draft initiated by a
 parliamentary deputy, mandated the establishment of a government migration
 agenc'to oversee migration-related issues, independent of the Ministry of Labor
 an     ial Protection, which formerly had responsibility for migration within the
 government.
 At the end of 1994, Kazakhstan and Russia initialed agreements that established
 broad legal rights for the citizens of one country living on the territory of the other,
 and provided for expeditious naturalization for citizens of one country who moved
 to the other. In July  t wo countries exchanged instruments of ratification to
 bring these agreements into force.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Although the Constitution provides for a democratic government, in practice the
 Government infringed on the right of citizens to change their overnment. The Con-
 stitution concentrates power in the presidency, granting the President considerable
 control over the legislature judiciary, and local government. The Constitution can-
 not be modified or amended without the consent of the President. In 1995 President
 Nazarbayev extended his term of officeto tohe year 2000 by referendum without a
 contested presidential election (which, according to the Constitution then in force,
 should have been held in 1996).
 A bicameral legislature took office in January 1996. The lower house (the Majilis),
 consisting of 67 members, was elected directly. The upper house (the Senate), with
 42 members, was elected indirectly, by members of oblast and city parliaments, with
 
 
 1146
 
 7 of its members appointed directly by the President. (The number of Senate seats
 was reduced after October by-elections from 47 to 42 in accordance with the Govern-
 ment's March decision to reduce the number of oblasts from 19 to 14.) The election
 law requires candidates for both houses to meet minimum age and education re-
 quirements, and to pay a nonrefundable registration fee of 100 times the minimum
 monthly wage (in a by-election in March, this fee was about $2,700 (190,000 tenge).
 The election law does not require Majilis candidates to collect a certain number of
 signatures in order to be placed on the ballot. Senate candidates, however, are re-
 quired to obtain signatures from 10 percent of the members of the local assemblies
 in their oblasts in order to be placed on the ballot. Some consider the election re-
 quirements, especially the registration fee, to be a barrier to parti cpation. The Con-
 stitution mandates that participation in elections is voluntary. However, experts
 stated that the law requiring participation of at least 50 percent of the eligible vot-
 er to make an election valdputs pressure on polling site workers to garner a suffi-
 cient number of votes and has been cited as one of the causes of fraud and vote
 inflation in past elections.
 The legislature cannot initiate changes in the Constitution or exercise oversight
 over the executive branch. The Parliament has, however, asserted itself with regard
 to the budget, challenging the figures presented by the Government and adjusting
 allocations. Should Parliament fail to pass within 30 days an "urgent" bill brought
 by the President, the President may issue the bill by decree. While the President
 has broad powers to dissolve Parliament, Parliament can remove the President only
 for disability or high treason, and only with the consent of the Constitutional Coun-
 cil, which is largely controlled by the President.
 Although the President has the right to legislate by decree, he respected the par-
 liamentary procedures laid out in the Constitution. During its first full session from
 September 1996 to June 1997, the Parliament passed 150 bills to the President for
 signature. Although the majority of bills was drafted by the executive, the Par-
 liament considered 19 bills that -were drafted and introduced by individual deputies.
 Several of the 19 bills initiated by parliamentary deputies were passed into law, in-
 cluding bills on government support for small business development, the develop-
 ment of nontraditional energy sources, and migration. However, the Parliament fell
 short in several areas. Parliamentary procedures were weak and constituent rela-
 tions were nonexistent. Most parliamentary activities continued to be conducted be-
 hind closed doors. Sessions were neither open to the public nor televised.
 The Constitution significantly constrains the independence of the judiciary. A
 Constitutional Council replaced the Constitutional Court in August 1995 when the
 new Constitution was adopted. Three of its seven members, including its chairman,
 are directly appointed by the President. A two-thirds majority of the Council is re-
 quired to overrule a Presidential veto. All judges are appointed directly by the Presi-
 dent.
 According to the Constitution, the governors of oblasts (the "akims") are selected
 by the Prime Minister but serve at the discretion of the President, who may also
 annul their decisions.
 The major national political opposition movements both called for the direct elec-
 tion of provincial governors and changes in the Government's economic reform poli-
 cies. Azamat is a movement of intellectuals dedicated to constructive opposition. Re-
 public is a popular front led by the Kazakhstani Communist Party representing 20
 political parties, public associations, and movements. The Government did not inter-
 fere with the development of either movement. In March, however, local officials in
 Almaty barred Azamat members from a meeting hall prior to the opening of a na-
 tional conference due to "fire code violations." In June a small group of opposition
 leaders formed an "antitotalitarian league," but the league remains inactive. In No-
 vember Marat Auezov one of the cochairmen of the Azamat political opposition
 movement, announced his candidacy for President for the 2000 elections. Also in No-
 vember, 11 opposition parties, including Azamat, the Communist Party, the ethnic
 Kazakh movement Azat, the ethnic Russian movement Lad, and the pensioners'
 movement Pokolenia, established a new People's Front to contest the 1999 and 2000
 elections.
 All adult citizens (at least 18 years of age) have the right to vote. Membership
 in political parties or trade unions is forbidden to members of the armed forces, em-
 ployees of national security and law enforcement organizations, and judges.
 There are no legal restrictions on the participation of women and minorities in
 politics, but the persistence of traditional attitudes means that few women hold high
 office or play active parts in political life. There is one female federal minister, but
 no female provincial governors (akims). Of 47 Senate members, 5 are women; of 67
 Majilis members, 9 are women.
 
 
 1147
 Although minority ethnic groups are represented in the Government, Kazakhs
 hold the majority of leadership positions. After an October government reorganiza-
 tion, only 3 of 14 government ministries are headed by non-Kazakhs. (In March the
 Government reduced the number of ministries from 21 to 14.) Non-Kazakhs are
 well-represented in the Majilis and the Senate.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Helsinki Watch, the International Bureau on Human Rights (formerly the
 Kazakhstan-American Bureau on Human Rights), and Legal Development of
 Kazakhstan are the most active of a small number of local human rights organiza-
 tions. They cooperate on human rights and legal reform issues. Although these
 groups operated largely without government interference, limited financial means
 ampered their ability to monitor and report human rights violations. Some human
 rights observers complained that the Government monitored their movements and
 tele hone calls.
 The Government permitted international and foreign nongovernmental organiza-
 tions (NGO's) dealing with human rights issues to visit Kazakhstan and meet with
 local human rights groups as well as government officials. The International Labor
 Organization, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies,
 and the UNHCR have permanent offices in the country. The Constitution forbids
 "the financing of political parties and trade unions by foreign legal entities and citi-
 zens, foreign states and international organizations." Independent trade union lead-
 er Leonid Solomin was charged with violating this provision after he accepted finan-
 cial assistance from the AFL-CIO's Free Trade Union Institute (see Section 6.a.).
 The Civil Code requires NGO's to register with the Government and most NGO's
 are registered; however, some continue to operate without legal standing. Although
 some government officials made an effort to work with domestic and foreign NGOs,
 others continued to assert that foreign NGO's promote instability. Some NGO's
 chose not to register because they objected to the requirement of registration in
 principle or because they do not have the money to pay the registration fee. Others
 believe that they were not eligible to register because they promoted the interests
 of one ethnic group or religion and are considered by some to violate the constitu-
 tional ban on inciting social, racial, national, religious, class, and tribal enmity. The
 new Criminal Code passed in July criminalizes the activity of NGO's that are not
 registered.
 A presidential commission on human rights was reorganized in May and is now
 led by a senator. The commission reached out to independent human rights organi-
 zations, but made little progress in establishing itself as an ombudsman. In general
 the Government tended to deny or ignore charges of specific human rights abuses,
 although the commission pledged to produce its own human rights report. Prior to
 the commission's reorganization, its secretary angered local human rights activists
 by alleging that they had "close ties with certain international human rights organi-
 zations of a dubious nature and with certain financial support from foreign coun-
 tries."
 In December the commission, the U.N. office in Almaty, and human rights NGO's,
 cohosted a human rights round table. While the conference was poorly attended, es-
 pecially by government officials, the fact of government involvement apparently in-
 dicateda nascent awareness of human rights problems by government officials.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution states "everyone is equal before law and court. No one may be
 subjected to any discrimination for reasons of origin, social position, occupation,
 property status, sex, race, nationality, language, attitude to religion, convictions,
 place of residence or any other circumstances." However, the Government does not
 effectively enforce this provision on a consistent basis. The Government has favored
 ethnic Kazakhs in government employment and, according to many citizens, in the
 process of privatizing state enterprises.
 Women.-According to human rights groups, there is considerable domestic vio-
 lence against women. A local NGO, the Feminist League, estimates that hundreds
 of thousands of women are the victims of spousal abuse. Police are often reluctant
 to intervene, considering it to be the family's business, unless they believe that the
 abuse is life threatening. The maximum sentence for wife beating is 3 years, but
 few such cases are prosecuted. The Government has not specifically addressed the
 problem. Law enforcement authorities reported 1,905 cases of rape in 1996 and ad-
 justed their 1995 figures to report 1,641 cases. Ministry of Interior officials stated
 that there were 1,343 reported cases of rape in the first 9 months of 1997. The pun-
 
 
 1148
 
 ishment for rape can range from 4 to 15 years. There is very little coverage of rape
 in the press, and rapes often go unreported.
 There is no legal discrimination against women, but women are severely under-
 represented in higher positions in government and state enterprises and overrepre-
 sented in low-paying and some menial jobs. Women have unrestricted access to
 higher education.
 Children-The Government is committed in principle to children's rights, but, as
 in many other areas, budget stringencies and other priorities severely limit its effec-
 tiveness in dealing with children's issues. There is no established pattern of govern-
 mental or societal abuse against children. Rural children normally work during har-
 vests (see Section 6.d.).
 People With Disabilities.--Citizens with disabilities are entitled by law to assist-
 ance from the State. There is no legal discrimination against people with disabil-
 ities, but in practice employers do not give them equal consideration. There are laws
 mandating the provision of accessibility to public buildings and commercial estab-
 lishments for the disabled, but the Government does not enforce these laws. Dis-
 abled persons are a low priority for the Government. Mentally ill and mentally re-
 tarded citizens can be committed to institutions ron by the State. These institutions
 are poorly run and inadequately funded. The NGO, International Bureau on Human
 Rights, reported that the Government provides almost no care fr the mentally ill
 and mentally retarded due to a lack of funds.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-The population is between 16 and 17 million
 and consists of approximately 45 percent Kzakhs and 35 percent ethnic Slays (Rus-
 sians, Ukrainians, Belorussians, and others), with many other ethnic groups rep-
 resented. In May, for what appeared to be political reasons, the Government an-
 nounced that ethnic Kazakhs composed 51 percent of the population; most neutral
 observers agree that this figure is not accurate.
 The Government continued to discriminate in favor of ethnic Kazakhs in govern-
 ment employment, where ethnic Kazakhs predominate, as well as in education,
 housing, and other areas. However, the Government has continued to back away
 from its "Kazakhification" campaign of the first year of independence. President
 Naarbayev has publicly emphasized that all nationalities are welcome, but many
 non-Kazakhs are anxious about what they perceive as expanding p references for
 ethnic Kazakhs. Many ethnic Kazakhs, however, believe that such affirmative ction
 is needed to reverse 200 years of discrimination.
 In December representatives of the Chechen and Ingush communities complained
 that law enforcement authorities unfairly singled them out as violators of the law.
 Law enforcement officials denied the allegations, noting that violators of the law are
 not divided by ethnic group.
 Most of the population speaks Russian; only about one-half of ethnic Kazakhs
 speak Kazakh fluently. According to the Constitution, the Kazakh language is the
 state language. The Constitution states that the Russian language is officially used
 on a basis equal with that of the Kazakh language in organizations and bodies of
 local self-administration. This slight increase in the status of the Russian langae
 (from its previous status as the Republits language of interethnic communication)
 did not satisfy some ethnic Russi, an Kazakhstams who had hoped that Russian
 would be designated a s a   p seond state language. The Government is encouraging
 more education of children in the Kazakh language, but has done little to provide
 Kazakh-langrage education for adults.
 In June a language law intended to strengthen the use of Kazakh without infring-
 ing on the rights of citizens to use other languages was passed by Parliament and
 signed into law by the President. Although introduction of the legislation in 1996
 created anxiety among many citizens-particularly among ethnic Slays--the final
 version of the bill offended few. The bili does not appropriate sufficient funding to
 make Kazakh language education universal. The Parliament deleted the bill's most
 controversial provision-the immediate establishment of a list of government posi-
 tions that must be held by individuals fluent in Kazakh bya s ecific date. Instead,
 the Parliammet is to compile a list of positions requiring Kazaih language fluency
 at some time in the future.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution and the Labor Code provide for
 basic worker rights, including the right to organize and the right to strike. In De-
 cember the Government withdrew the latest draft Labor Code from consideration
 after sharp criticism from parliamentary deputies and returned it to the Ministry
 of Labor to be redrafted.
 Most workers remained members of state-sponsored trade unions established dur-
 ing the Soviet period, when membership was obligatory. At most enterprises, the
 
 
 1149
 state-sponsored unions continued to deduct 1 percent of each worker's wage as dues.
 In addition the Government withholds 30 percent of each worker's wage, 85 percent
 of which is for the state pension fund, 5 percent for social insurance, and 10 percent
 for health care. An additional 2 percent of each worker's wage is withheld for the
 unemployment fund. The state unions under the Communist system were, and for
 the most part still are, organs of the Government, and work with management to
 enforce labor discipline and to discourage workers from forming or joining independ-
 ent unions.
 The law gives workers the right to join or form unions of their choosing and to
 stop the automatic dues deductions for the state unions. However, enterprises often
 continue to withhold dues for the state-sponsored union in spite of requests from
 individual workers to stop the deduction. The Independent Trade Union Center of
 Kazakhstan claims membership of about 500 000 out of a total work force of about
 5.6 million; however, the actual number of independent trade union members is esti-
 mated to be closer to 70 000 To obtain legal status, an independent union must
 apply for registration with the local judicial authority at the oblast level and with
 the Ministry of Justice. Registration is generally lengthy, difficult, and expensive.
 The decision to register a union appears to be arbitrary, with no published criteria.
 Although no unions appear to have been denied registration, the independent trade
 union center had difficulty registering and a labor union in Kapchagai waited 5
 months to be registered. The two major independent trade union confederations are
 registered. Judicial authorities and the Ministry of Justice have the authority to
 cancel a union's registration; however, there is no evidence that the Ministry of Jus-
 tice has used this authority.
 The law does not provide mechanisms to protect workers who join independent
 unions from threats or harassment by enterprise management or state-run unions.
 Members of independent unions have been dismissed, transferred to lower paying
 or lower status jobs, threatened, and intimidated. According to independent union
 leaders, state unions work closely with management to ensure that independent
 trade union members are the first fired in times of economic downturn.
 A 1995 tripartite agreement between labor, management, and the Government,
 designed to help resolve labor issues and disputes, remained moribund. Efforts to
 revive the agreement were unsuccessful and the tripartite agreement failed.
 Unions and individual workers exercised their right to strike in 1997, primarily
 to protest the nonpayment of wages and in an attempt to recover back wages owed
 to workers. Nonpayment of wages continued to be the priority issue for workers.
 Miners' strikes in the coal mining region of Karaganda continued throughout the
 year. According to the law, workers may exercise the right to strike only if a labor
 dispute has not been resolved by means of existing conciliation procedures. In addi-
 tion the law requires that employers be notified that a strike is to occur no less than
 15 days before its commencement. There were numerous unsanctioned strikes
 throughout the country to protest the nonpayment of wages. In February 106 work-
 ers at the Karaganda heat and power plant went on strike to protest the nonpay-
 ment of wages. In March 1,500 teachers who had not received salaries for several
 months went on strike in Semipalatinsk. In May the Kapchagai city prosecutor at-
 tempted to sue the employees of the power company for organizing an illegal strike
 to protest the problem of unpaid wages. The Kapchagai city court ruled that the
 strke was illegal and that the company would not have to pay the workers for the
 days on which the strike took place. The workers appealed the decision and the pro-
 vincial court upheld their appeal. The city prosecutor appealed the decision and the
 case was returned to the Kapchagai city court. No final decision has been made, but
 none of the workers involved have been fined or dismissed.
 On October 1, about 1,000 workers of the Achpolimetal Metallurgical Plant began
 a 600 mile march from Kentau to Almaty to protest the nonpayment of wages. The
 plant is being operated by a Swedish company under a management contract. The
 workers were stopped by police 5 miles from Kentau. They refused to move until
 10 months' of back wages, totaling about $1.6 million (120 million tenge) were paid.
 On October 31, the Government and Swedish company agreed to pay all wage ar-
 rears and the workers returned home. However, on November 15, the Kentau Fros-
 ecutor General's office accused five independent trade union leaders of organizing
 the march without the permission of the authorities. The Kentau city court refused
 to hear the case. The Prosecutor General's office appealed and the provincial court
 ruled that the protest march was unsanctioned and illegal. The provincial court's
 decision was appealed to the Supreme Court and a decision is pending. There have
 been no arrests made in the case.
 As a result of their inability to pay salaries, many enterprises continued to pay
 wages in scrip rather than in cash, a practice at odds with International Labor Or-
 ganization Convention 95 on the protection of wages other than in the legal cur-
 
 
 1150
 
 rency without the express consent of the workers. Enterprise directors claimed that
 the enterprises were not being paid in cash by their traditional trading partners in
 other parts of the former Soviet Union, which were also experiencing cash flow dif-
 ficulties as a result of the general economic crisis. The scrip was often not accepted
 at stores or was accepted only at devalued levels.
 By law unions may freely join federations or confederations and affiliate with
 international bodies. Most independent trade unions belong to the Independent
 Trade Union Center of Kazakhstan (ITUCK) headquartered in Almaty. The Inde-
 pendent Miners' Federation of Kazakhstan and the State Miners' Union of
 Karaganda are members of the Miners' International Federation. The unions be-
 longing to the ITUCK are not members of international federations but do maintain
 contacts with foreign trade union federations.
 Independent unions complain about a p revision in the Constitution that forbids
 the financing of trade unions by foreign legal entities and citizens, foreign states,
 and international organizations. Since independence, independent trade unions have
 received financial assistance from the AFL-CIO's Free Trade Union Institute
 (FTUI). Most of this assistance ended in 1996 when FTUI funding was reduced.
 Since then independent trade unions have sought new means of support. Some asso-
 ciations of trade unions were able to receive financing from foreign sources by reg-
 istering as "public organizations" rather than labor unions.
 On January 6, in what was interpreted by human rights activists as a govern-
 ment attempt to suppress the independent trade union movement, Independent
 Trade Union Center leader Leonid Solomin was charged with violating currency
 laws (by paying his workers in dollars) and the constitutional ban on obtaining fi-
 nancial support from foreign sources, in this case, the AFL-CIO's FTUI. Solomin
 had organized several pretest demonstrations in the fall of 1996. The KNB opened
 an investigation, froze Solomin's trade union and personal bank accounts, and ques-
 tioned Solomin and his staff over several months about the case. Solomin reported
 that during the investigation, his home was burglarized and personal records stolen.
 In September the Government closed the case due to a lack of evidence of wrong-
 doing and dropped all charges.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-There are significant limits
 on the right to organize and bargain collectively. Most large scale enterprises have
 been privatized or rented to foreign companies under management contracts and are
 no longer entirely dependent on state production orders. Collective bargaining rights
 are not spelled out in the law, although in some instances unions successfully nego-
 tiated agreements with management. If a union's demands are not acceptable to
 management, it may present those demands to an arbitration commission composed
 of management, union officials, and independent technical experts. Unions routinely
 appealed to arbitration commissions. In October workers from Kentau successfully
 resolved through an arbitration commission their complaints regarding 10 months
 of unpaid wages. There is no legal protection against antiunion discrimination.
 There are no export processing zones. Several free economic zones enjoy all the
 privileges of export processing zones, as well as other tax privileges and abatements,
 but labor conditions there appear to be no different than elsewhere in the country.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Constitution prohibits forced
 labor except "at the sentence of the court or in the conditions of a state of emergency
 or martial law," and it is generally not known to occur. However, in northern
 Kazakhstan some persons were still required to provide labor or the use of privately
 owned equipment with no, or very low, compensation to help gather the annual
 grain harvest.
 The Constitution does not specifically prohibit forced and bonded labor by chil-
 dren, but such practices are not known to occur.
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment.-The mini-
 mum age for employment is 16 years. A child under age 16 may work only with
 the permission of the local administration and the trade union in the enterprise in
 which the child would work. Such permission is rarely granted. Although the Con-
 stitution does not specifically prohibit forced and bonded labor by children, there
 were no reports of such practices (see Section 6.c.). Abuse of child labor is generally
 not a problem, although child labor is routinely used in agricultural areas, especially
 during harvest season.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-In 1997 the Government resumed publication
 of a minimum wage. In May the minimum monthly wage was approximately $27.46
 (2,060 tenge). This was a sizable increase over previous years, but still far from suf-
 ficient to provide a decent standard of living for a worker and family.
 The legal maximum workweek is 48 hours, although most enterprises maintained
 a 40-hour workweek, with at least a 24-hour rest period. The Constitution provides
 
 
 1151
 that labor agreements stipulate the length of working time, vacation days, holidays,
 and paid annual leave for each worker.
 Although the Constitution provides for the right to "safe and hygienic working
 conditions," working and safety conditions in the industrial sector are substandard.
 Safety consciousness is low. Workers in factories usually do not wear protective
 clothing, such as goggles and hard hats, and work in conditions of poor visibility
 and ventilation. Management largely igores regulations concerning occupational
 health and safety, enforceable by the Ministry of Labor and the state-sponsored
 unions. Workers, including miners, have no legal right to remove themselves from
 dangerous work situations without jeopardy to continued employment.
