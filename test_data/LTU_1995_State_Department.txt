 LITHUANIA
 Lithuania is a parliamentary democracy. With its statehood widely recognized as
 continuous for more than 70 years, Lithuania restored its independence in 1990
 after more than 50 years of Soviet occupation. The Constitution, adopted by referen-
 dum in 1992, established a 141-member unicameral legislature, the Seimas; a di-
 rectly elected President, who functions as Head of State; and a Government formed
 by a Prime Minister and other ministers, appointed by the President and approved
 by the Seimas. The Government exercises authority with the approval of the Seimas
 and the President. In fair elections in 1992 the Lithuanian Democratic Labor Party
 (LDDP)-the successor to the Communist Party of Lithuania, which in 1989 broke
 away from the Soviet Communist Party-won a majority of parliamentary seats and
 formed the Government. In 1993 voters elected Algirdas Brazauskas, then Chair-
 man of the LDDP as President. Local government elections in March, however,
 gave the ruling LDbP its first electoral defeat since 1992. Right-of-center candidates
 captured a majority of local government councils in most of the country's towns and
 cities.
 A unified national police force under the jurisdiction of the Interior Ministry is
 responsible for law enforcement. The State Security Department is responsible for
 internal security and reports to Parliament and the President. The police committed
 a number of human rights abuses.
 Since independence, Lithuania has moved to a market economy. More than 40
 percent of state property, including most housing and small businesses, has been
 privatized. Industry employs 42 percent of the labor force. The agricultural sector's
 continuing high proportion of the work force (18 percent) reflects a lack of efficient
 consolidation of small private farms and represents a vocal protectionist current in
 economic policy debates. The banking system remains weak, with the Government
 moving just before Christmas to suspend operations at two prominent private com-
 mercia banks for illiquidity and fraud. The inflation rate of 35.7 percent was sig-
 nificantly higher than had been projected. Per capita gross domestic product was es-
 timated at $1,000 per year. Trade is diversifying, with a gradual shift to Western
 markets. Major exports include textile and knitwear products, timber and furniture,
 electronic goods, food, and chemical and petroleum products.
 The Government generally respects the human rights of its citizens, but problems
 remain in some areas. Police on occasion beat detainees and reportedly abuse al-
 ready excessive detention laws. Some journalists allege that government officials
 apply pressure on them not to criticize governmental policies or acts. Jewish ceme-
 teries are sporadically subjected to vandalism and pilfering. Violence and discrimi-
 nation against women and child abuse are problems which the Government has
 failed to address. In April the Parliament ratified the European Convention on
 Human Rights and Basic Freedoms.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political or other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of politically
 motivated killings.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 There were no reports that officials engaged in or condoned torture. However, police
 sometimes beat or otherwise physically mistreated detainees. The local press re-
 ported that incidents of police brutality are becoming more common. In many in-
 stances, the victims reportedly are reluctant to bring charges against police oicers
 owing to fear of reprisals. The Ministry of the Interior generally has been unwilling
 to publicize statistics on reported cases of policy brutality. Sources in the Par-
 liament, however reported that there were 116 complaints concerning employees of
 the Ministry of the Interior, of which 15 had been resolved and 74 are still under
 investigation. Owing to limited resources and motivation, many of Lithuania's pris-
 ons are poorly maintained.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Except in cases that come under the pro-
 visions of the Preventive Detention Law (described below), police may detain a per-
 son for up to 72 hours, based upon reliable evidence of criminal activity. At the end
 of that period, police must decide whether or not to make a formal arrest, and a
 magistrate must approve an arrest warrant. The authorities have a total of 10 days
 to present supporting evidence. Once a suspect is formally charged, prosecutors may
 keep the person under investigative arrest for up to 2 months before taking the case
 to court. In exceptional cases, investigative arrest may be extended by a further 6
 
 
 to 9 months with the written approval of the Procurator General The Constitution
 provides for the right to an attorney from the moment of detention.
 In an effort to cope with the rise in violent organized crime, Parliament in 1993
 passed the Preventive Detention Law pertaining to persons suspected of being vio-
 lent criminals. This law, which was passed as a temporary measure, allowed police,
 but not the internal security or armed forces, to detain suspected violent criminals
 up to 2 months rather than for the standard 72-hour period. The effect of this law
 is to give prosecutors and investigators additional time to conduct an investigation
 and file formal criminal charges against the detainee. Those apprehended must be
 released after 2 months if an investigation does not lead to formal charges. Local
 police commissioners must obtain the Procurator General's approval of each arrest
 carried out under the provisions of this law.
 Parliament voted in 1994 and 1995 to extend this temporaiy law for an additional
 year but with several new provisions, including checks on prosecutorial abuse. The
 law now requires that a detainee (1) must be informed within 3 hours following ar-
 rest of the length of the preventive detention under consideration (not to exceed 2
 months) and (2) must be brought before a court within 48 hours of arrest for a rul-
 ing on the legality of the detention. Furthermore, a detainee has the legal right to
 consult with an attorney during the period of detention. The law gives law enforce-
 ment officials wide latitude in making arrest decisions and may be open to abuse.
 Police detained over 500 suspected members of criminal gangs under the provision
 of this law. In several well-publicized cases, the law helped to convict and sentence
 dangerous criminals to lengthy prison terms. In many other instances, however, the
 suspects were freed without charge after expiration of the maximum detention pe-
 riod, leading some observers to believe that the police are abusing the lengthy de-
 tention period provided by this temporary law.
 There is no exile.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-Efforts continued in 1995 to reform legal codes
 imposed under the Soviets. Parliament passed new civil and criminal procedure
 codes as well as a Court Reform Law. The judicial system currently consists of a
 two-tier structure of district courts and the Supreme Court, which is an appellate
 court. There is also a Constitutional Court. Court decisions are arrived at independ-
 ently. The Procurator General exercises an oversight responsibility through a net-
 work of district prosecutors who work with police investigators-employed by the
 Ministry of the Interior-in preparing the prosecution's evidence for the courts. The
 Soviet-era institution of lay assessors was abolished at the end of 1994.
 Under the Court Reform Law now being implemented, two new kinds of courts
 are being created. Local district: courts are being set up below the present district
 courts to handle cases at the municipal level, while a new appellate court level is
 hearing appeals arising from district court decisions, thereby reducing the case load
 of the overburdened Supreme Court. In addition, as a result of Lithuania's accession
 to the Council of Europe, the Ministry of Justice has begun a thorough review of
 the country's laws with a view towards bringng them into accord with the provi-
 sions of the European Convention on Human Rights.
 The Constitution provides defendants the right to counsel. In practice, the right
 to legal counsel is abridged by the shortage of trained lawyers, who find it difficult
 to cope with the burgeoning numbers of criminal cases brought before the courts.
 Outside observers have recommended the establishment of a public defender system
 to regularize procedures for provision of legal assistance to indigent persons charged
 in criminal cases. By law defense lawyers have access to government evidence and
 may present evidence and witnesses. The courts and law enforcement agencies gen-
 erally honor routine, written requests for evidence. There were no political trials.
 Government rehabilitation of more than 50,000 persons charged with anti-Soviet
 crimes during the Stalinist era led to reports in 1991 that some people alleged to
 have been involved in crimes against humanity during the Nazi occupation had ben-
 efited from this rehabilitation. A special judicial procedure was established to exam-
 ine each case in which an individual or organization raised an objection that a reha-
 bilitated person may have committed a crime against humanity. In 1994 the Su-
 preme Court overturned the rehabilitation of three persons whose cases were pend-
 inKfrom 1993; there were no such rulings by the Supreme Court in 1995.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution provides for the right to privacy. Authorities do not engage in indis-
 criminate or widespread monitoring of ge correspondence or communications of citi-
 zens. With the written authorization of a procurator or judge, however, police and
 the security service may engage in surveillance and monitoring activities on grounds
 of national security. Except in cases of hot pursuit or the danger of disappearance
 
 
 934
 of evidence, police must obtain a search warrant signed by a prosecutor before they
 may enter the premises.
 It is widely assumed, however, that law enforcement agencies have increased the
 use of a range of surveillance methods to cope with the epansion of organized
 crime. There is some question as to the legal basis of this police surveillance, but
 there are no known cases challenging the legality of surveillance.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech
 and the press, which the Government observes in practice. The law prohibits the
 Government from issuing prior restraint orders over the print or broadcast media
 or setting restrictions on the disclosure of information, unless the Government de-
 termines that national security is involved. Nevertheless, journalists working for the
 state-owned electronic media complained about pressure by superiors to avoid criti-
 cism of government policies in their television and radio reporting. Most independ-
 ent news publications and many prominent journalists protested against the provi-
 sions of a draft public information law, which they thought severely restricted free-
 dom of the press. The draft law failed to paso in a November 6 vote, but parliamen-
 tary debate on a press law was expectedto continue. The ruling party announced
 the formation of a committee to review the proposed press law and the provisions
 which prompted the protests.
 Many investigative journalists covering organized crime have been harassed by or
 received death threats, ostensibly from organized "crime families." In October 1993,
 a copublisher and editor of a widely read daily, who wrote extensively on organized
 crime, was murdered. In October 1994, the Supreme Court convicted four persons
 with criminal backgrounds of murder in the case. One person received a death sen-
 tence, which was carried out in July.
 On November 17, a bomb destroyed a major new building under construction for
 the largest Lithuanian daily, Lietuvos Rytas. The newspaper had been writing a se-
 ries on Lithuanian organized crime families. It is widely assumed that one or more
 of these families were responsible for the bombing, although the Government had
 filed no charges by year's end. Some observers also expressed concern over the Gov-
 ernment's motives in sending tax inspectors to the scene shortly after the blast.
 Press reports of the meeting between Lietuvos Rytas editors and President
 Brazauskas 2 days after the bombing stated that Brazauskas had chided the editors
 for publishing charges against organized crime figures without supporting evidence.
 These events took place in the context of a parliamentary debate in which opposi-
 tion members criticized the Government for making antipress statements in reac-
 tion against journalists' investigation of official corruption.
 Five private radio stations, including one broadcasting in Polish, are on the air.
 Two private television stations also broadcast regular programming to wide audi-
 ences. Representatives of the private electronic media have complained for some
 time about unfair transmission fees and advertising rates set by the Government.
 These rates reportedly favor the state radio and television stations.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for,
 and the authorities respect, the right of citizens to associate freely, requiring only
 that they inform local government authorities of planned demonstrations. The law
 is respected in practice. The Communist Party of Lithuania and other organizations
 associated with the Soviet regime continue to be banned.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for religious freedom, and the
 Government respects this provision in practice. The Law on Religious Communities
 and Associations passed in October gives religious communities, associations, and
 centers property rights to prayer houses, homes, and other buildings and permits
 construction necessary for their activities. Nine religious communities have been de-
 clared by the new law to be "traditional" and therefore eligible for governmental as-
 sistance: Latin Rite Catholics, Greek Rite Catholics, Evangelical Lutherans, Evan-
 gelical Reformers, Orthodox, Old Believers, Jews, Sunni Muslims, and Karaites.
 ere are no restrictions on the activities of other religious communities.
 A small Jewish community exists, largely in the main cities. Jewish leaders called
 on officials to provide better police protection for Jewish cemeteries in Kaunas,
 Vilnius, and Klaipeda which have been subject to sporadic vandalism and pilfering.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-Under the law, citizens and permanent residents are permitted free
 movement within, and return to, their country. There are no restrictions on foreign
 travel. The law on refugee status was signed on July 4. The vast majority of refu-
 gees in Lithuania are fleeing economic rather than political situations in their coun-
 tries and are thus not eligible for asylum.

 Section 3. Respect for Political Right& The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Lithuania is a parliamentary democracy. The election law provides for a secret
 ballot in parliamentary elections. Of 141 parliamentary seats, 71 are elected directly
 and 70 through proportional representation. A party must draw a minimum of 4
 percent of the national vote in order to gain a seat through proportional representa-
 tion. National minority slates are exempt from this ruIle. Two of the four Polish
 Union representatives won their seats on a proportional basis even though the
 union slate captured only 2 percent of the nationwide proportional vote.
 The Citizenship Law, adopted in 1991 and amended in October, is inclusive with
 regard to the country's ethnic minorities. This law provides citizenship to persons
 who were born within the borders of the republic; who were citizens of Lithuania
 prior to 1940 and their descendants; or who became citizens under previous legal
 authority. More than 90 percent of Lithuania's ethnic Russian, Polish, Belarussian,
 and Ukrainian inhabitants received citizenship. Qualification for naturalization of
 persons not mentioned by the above-mentioned categories requires a 10-year resi-
 dency, a permanent job or source of income, knowledge of the Constitution, renunci-
 ation of any other citizenship, and proficiency in Lithuanian.
 There are no legal restrictions on women's participation in politics or government.
 However, women are underrepresented in political leadership positions. There are
 only 10 female deputies in the 141-member Seimas, and no female ministers serve
 in the current Cabinet.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The Government fully cooperates with local nongovernmental organizations and
 actively encourages visits by international and nongovernmental human rights
 groups. The Association for the Defense of Human Rights in Lithuania is an um-
 brella organization for several small human rights groups which operates without
 government restriction. In 1994 the Government established a department of human
 rights within the Ministry of Justice, which monitors laws and legal practice to de-
 termine whether these are in accord with Lithuania's international obligations.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution prohibits discrimination based on race, sex, religion, disability,
 or ethnic background, and the Government generally respects these prohibitions.
 Women.-Abuse of women at home is reportedly common, especially in connection
 with alcohol abuse by husbands, and institutional mechanisms for coping with this
 problem are only now being formed. One private women's organization is attempting
 to establish a shelter for abused women. According to one sociological survey, 20
 percent of women reported an attempted rape, while another 33 percent reported
 having been beaten at least once in their lives. Official statistics on the incidence
 of abuse of women in the home are not filed separately from other categories of as-
 sault. Women's groups report some resistance among law enforcement officials to
 collecting and reeasmg such statistics. Persons convicted of rape generally receive
 Eentences of 3 to 5 years in prison.
 The Constitution provides equal rights for men and women, and official policy
 specifies equal pay for equal work. Generaly, men and women receive the same pay
 for comparable work. However, women are largely underrepresented in some proies-
 sions and in the managerial sector as a whole, and significant inequalities in Lith-
 uanian society based on sex continue. Lithuanian society still has very conservative
 views about the role of women in society. The fact that women's enrollment now ex-
 ceeds that of men in some university faculties has prompted university administra-
 tors to introduce preferential entrance criteria for men to redress what is perceived
 as an abnormal state of affairs. Parliamentary deputies speaking about female dep-
 uties in public sometimes make unflattering comments based on gender stereotypes,
 without eliciting any public reaction.
 Children.-Child abuse is a problem. The authorities reported that 10 children
 were killed as a result of severe beatings by parents in the first half of 1995. Social
 welfare workers believe that much of the abuse occurs in connection with alcohol
 abuse. The prevalence of authoritarian values in family upbringing has discouraged
 more active measures against child abuse.
 The Ministries of Social Protection and of the Interior shared official responsibility
 for the protection of children's rights and welfare in 1995. Starting in 1994, the
 Children's Rights Service of the Ministry of Social Protection took on many of the
 functions formerly handled by the Ministry of the Interior and its subordinate police
 officers throughout the country, thereby focusing more attention on the social wel-
 
 
 fare needs of children. The Government showed its commitment to children's rights
 and welfare by ratifying the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child
 in July.
 People With Disabilities.-The Law on Integrating Disabled People, passed in
 1991 provides for a broad category of rights and government benefits to which dis-
 abled people are legally entitled. However, given severe budgetary constraints, the
 Government has been able to allocate only modest sums towards implementation of
 this law. The equivalent of $3.25 million was disbursed in 1994. No 1995 figures
 were available.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-Ethnic minorities comprise roughly 20 per-
 cent of the population and include Russians, Poles, Belarussians, Ukrainians, and
 Jews. Ethnic Poles in particular have expressed concerns about the possibility of job
 discrimination arising from implementation of the language law. The law requires
 that public sector employees possess a functional knowledge of Lithuanian within
 a specified time. The authorities have granted liberal extensions of the time in
 which this is to be achieved. During the first 4 months of 1995, language-testing
 committees tested 6,975 people for whom Lithuanian is not a native language. Of
 those examined, 6,048 were certified as language qualified. There is no documented
 evidence of dismissals based on application of thislaw. Lithuanian authorities have
 indicated that the intent of the law is to apply moral incentives to learn Lithuanian
 as the official language of the State and that no one would be dismissed solely be-
 cause of an inability to meet the language requirement. This appears to be the case.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Associaon.-The Constitution and the 1991 Law on Trade Unions
 recognize the right of workers and employees to form and join trade unions. The
 Law on Trade Unions formally extends this right to employees of the police and the
 armed forces, although the Collective Agreements Law of 1991 does not allow collec-
 tive bargaining by government employees involved in law enforcement and security-
 related w        1990 the Lithuanian branch of the U.S.S.R.'s All-Union Central
 Council of Trade Unions, grouping 23 of 25 trade unions, renamed itself the Confed-
 eration of Free Trade Unions (CFTU) and began asserting increased independence
 from its Soviet parent. In 1993 the CFTU joined eight other unions that also had
 been part of the All-Union Central Council to form the Lithuanian Trade Union
 Center (LTUC).
 The Lithuanian Workers Union (LWU) was formed in 1990 as an alternative to
 the CFTU. Unlike the CFTU/LTUC, the LWU was an early supporter of restoring
 independence and actively sought Western free trade union contacts. The LWU now
 claims a dues-paying membership of 50,000 organized in 35 regional groupings.
 There are no restrictions on unions affiliating with international trade unions. The
 Constitution and the Law on Trade Unions provide for the right to strike, although
 public officials providing essential services may not strike. There were several
 strikes in 1995, none major.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The Collective Agreements
 Law provides for collective bargaining and the right of unions to organize employ-
 ees, although several provisions reportedly hinder the establishment of new union
 organizations. According to this Law, unions, in order to be registered, must have
 at least 30 founding members in large enterprises or have a membership of one-fifth
 of all employees in small enterprises. Difficulties commonly arise in state enter-
 prises in which employees are represented by more than one union. LWU officials
 charge that managers in some state enterprises discriminate against LWU organiz-
 ers and have on occasion dismissed employees in retribution for their trade union
 activities. The LWU also charges that the judicial system is slow to respond to LWU
 grievances regarding dismissals from work. LWU representatives charge that state
 managers sometimes prefer the CFTU/LTUC over the LWU unions as collective bar-
 gaining partners.
 In general, trade union spokesmen say that, except in larger factories with well-
 organized trade unions, managers often determine wages without regard to trade
 union wishes. The Government issues periodic decrees that serve as guidelines for
 state enterprise management in setting wage scales. The LWU and the LTUC en-
 gage in direct collective bargaining over wages at the workplace level. Wage deci-
 sions are increasingly being made at the enterprise level, although government min-
 istries still retain some wage control in state-owned enterprises. The LWU reports
 that it supplements its bargaining efforts with active lobbying in government min-
 istries that own enterprises. During the first 6 months of 1995, wages continued to
 grow faster than average price increases, thereby continuing a process of modest
 real wage growth that began in 1993.
 There are no export processing zones.
 
 
 937
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Constitution prohibits forced
 labor and this prohibition is observed in practice.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of ChiIren.-The legal minimum age for em-
 ployment of children without parental consent is 16 years. The legal minimum age
 with the written consent of parents is 14. Free trade union representatives assert
 that the mechanisms for monitoring minimum age legislation are rudimentary.
 Complaints about infringement of child labor regulations generally are referred to
 local prosecutors who investigate the charges and take legal action to stop viola-
 tions. Available evidence suggests that child labor is rare.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The legal minimum wage is $30 (120 litas) per
 month, while the average wage in the state industrial sector is $128 (512 litas) per
 month. The Council of Ministers and the Ministry of Social Protection periodically
 set the minimum wage. Every 3 months these two government bodies must submit
 their minimum wage proposals to the Parliament, which has the right to approve
 or revise the minimum wage level. Enforcement of the minimum wage is almost
 nonexistent, in part because the Government does not want to exacerbate the cur-
 rent unemployment problem. The 40-hour workweek is standard, with a provision
 for at least one 24-hour rest period.
 The Constitution provides that workers have the right to safe and healthy work-
 ing conditions. In 1993 a Labor Safety Law went into effect, setting down the rights
 of workers confronted with hazardous conditions and providing legal protection for
 workers who file complaints about such conditions. The State Labor Inspection Serv-
 ie, which the law established, is charged with implementing the Labor Safety Law.
 Regional labor ispion offies, each of which have only two or three officials, are
 severely understaffed. They closed 1,882 enterprises or departments of enterprises
 found to be in violation of safety regulations during the first 6 months of 1995. Some
 170 persons were fined, and 83 cases were referred to local prosecutors' offices. Un-
 safe conditions caused by worn, outdated industrial technologies are reportedly
 widespread, and 46 work-related deaths were recorded in the first 6 months of 1995.
