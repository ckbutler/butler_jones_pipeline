 SWITZERLAND
 Switzerland, with its ancient and deep-rooted democratic
 traditions, remains a bastion of individual freedom and human
 rights. This freedom is fully guaranteed under the Swiss
 Constitution. Swiss social and political institutions are
 designed to provide citizens with the necessities of life and
 the Swiss enjoy, as a result, one of the highest standards of
 living in the world today.
 Switzerland's federal structure, in which the cantons retain a
 large degree of autonomy, and the wide linguistic and religious
 diversity of the country have generated a system of consensus.
 All decisions or significant changes in policies directly
 affecting Swiss citizens are taken only with the consensus of
 the majority of Swiss citizens by means of referenda.
 Under the Swiss federal system, there is considerable
 involvement in human rights matters by the cantons. This
 involvement, however, is limited by federal legislative and
 constitutional guarantees, which afford all defendants the
 right to appeal to the federal courts if they believe that
 their constitutional rights or due process have been violated
 in the cantonal courts. Switzerland complements itsexcellent
 human rights record through its role as the seat of many
 international organizations concerned with humanitarian affairs
 and its traditional support for refugees.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Killing
 There are no reports of killings in Switzerland attributed
 either to the Government, federal or cantonal, or to opposition
 and terrorist groups.
 b. Disappearance
 There have been no allegations of persons being abducted,
 secretly arrested, or held in clandestine detention.
 c. Torture
 Freedom from torture is guaranteed by the Constitution, and
 there have been no allegations of persons being tortured.
 d. Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 Freedom from cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or
 punishment is guaranteed, and there have been no allegations of
 cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment. The Swiss Constitution
 prohibits corporal punishment.
 e. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 Habeas corpus does not exist in Switzerland in the same form as
 in common law countries. However, freedom from arbitrary
 arrest and imprisonment is guaranteed by law. A detained
 person may not be held longer than 24 hours without a warrant
 of arrest issued by the judge conducting the preliminary
 investigation. Once the warrant is issued, the individual may
 be detained as long as necessary until the investigation is
 completed. However, the length of investigative detention is
 always reviewed by higher judicial authority, and
 
 
 1004
 traditionally, investigations are conducted within a very brief
 period. A suspect must immediately be shown the warrant under
 which he or she is being held, and he has a right to contact
 legal counsel as soon as an arrest warrant is issued. Bail, or
 release on personal recognizance, is traditionally granted,
 unless the examining magistrate believes the individual is a
 danger to society or will not appear for trial. Minor cases
 are tried by a single judge; difficult cases by a panel of
 judges; and murder or other serious crimes by a public jury.
 According to long-standing tradition in Switzerland, even the
 most serious cases are usually brought to trial within several
 weeks or, at the most, a few months.
 f. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 There have been no allegations of denial of fair public trial
 in Switzerland. The court system is an independent branch of
 the Government, and fair, public trials are guaranteed by the
 Swiss Constitution.
 g. Invasion of the Home
 Freedom from invasion of the home is guaranteed by law. A
 magistrate's warrant is required in order to enter a private
 residence. There have been no allegations of violations of the
 home by the Swiss authorities.
 2. Respect for Civil and Political Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Switzerland has no restrictions on political expression,
 whether speech or press, except those placed on groups
 considered a potential threat to the confederation. No such
 groups are currently designated. An area of continuing concern
 is the rights of linguistic minorities. From time to time,
 there are concerns expressed by the representatives of the
 Italian and Romansh linguistic groups that their languages do
 not receive the same support from the authorities as do German
 and French, the other national languages. The Government has
 generally been responsive to these concerns and has tried to
 meet them in an appropriate manner.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Switzerland places no restrictions on peaceful assembly and
 association. However, generational conflict has resulted in
 some street violence in the recent past. In a few instances,
 involving demonstrations mostly by young people, the police
 have been criticized for a tendency to react violently to
 social protest, and their actions have been forcefully
 condemned in parliamentary interventions and by the media.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 In Switzerland there is absolute religious tolerance. Freedoms
 of creed and conscience are guaranteed by the Constitution.
 There are constitutional guarantees to ensure that no religious
 group can have a dominant role in the society. Related to the
 freedom of religion is the issue of universal military service
 by Swiss men, since Swiss law provides no exemption for reason
 of conscience. Over the last ten years there has been an
 .almost 100 percent conviction rate for refusal to accept
 induction for reason of conscience. Concern has been expressed
 
 
 1005
 by some Swiss, as well as by Amnesty International, with regard
 to this situation. Recently, steps have been taken by members
 of the Swiss parliament to initiate a change in the Swiss
 Constitution which would provide alternative service for those
 who wish to claim exemption for reason of conscience.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel,
 Emigration, and Repatriation
 Constitutional guarantees assure freedom of movement within
 Switzerland, foreign travel, emigration, and repatriation.
 About 30,000 refugees currently are settled in Switzerland.
 e. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Switzerland has a highly developed constitutional democracy.
 Federal legislative power is vested in a bicameral legislature
 elected by universal suffrage. Although Swiss women have the
 federal franchise, the electors in two small half-cantons have
 not yet granted full voting rights to women for local issues.
 Labor has full freedom to organize, strike, and to make its
 influence felt through the political process. The strike
 option is rarely envoked, and Swiss labor relations are
 characterized by "industrial peace".
 3. Government Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 There have been no requests during recent decades for outside
 investigations of the human rights situation in Switzerland.
 4. Economic, Social, and Cultural Situation
 The Swiss Government is committed to ensure that the vital
 needs of the entire Swiss community are fulfilled. This
 commitment is shared by the cantons, voluntary organizations
 and private industry, all of which play an essential role in
 providing for the welfare of all Swiss. There is a fair
 distribution of wealth among the strata of Swiss society; its
 per capita GNP of $16,439.6 (1980) is the highest in the
 industrialized world. Health services are easily available and
 of superior quality; the infant mortality rate is 8.5/1000, and
 life expectancy at birth is 75.1 years. Unemployment is of
 minor significance, although during the last year the figure of
 .41 percent for unemployment has caused some concern, in a
 country where unemployment had previously been virtually
 non-existent. Education is free through the university level,
 but because of limited resources, is not accessible to everyone
 at the higher levels. The primary school enrollment ratio is
 86% (1978), and the adult literacy rate is 99%.
 Citizens have the right to own property. This right is
 strictly controlled with regard to real estate acquisition by
 foreigners.
 The Swiss population growth rate of 0.3% is quite low, and as
 much as 15 percent of the total population of Swizerland is
 made up of foreign workers and their families. Swiss policy
 over the years has not comprehensively attempted to integrate
 the resident foreign workers into Swiss social services
 programs. This problem has been recognized by the federal
 authorities, which are now attempting to formulate policies to
 accomplish this aim. A referendum in June 1982, however,
 
 
 1006
 turned down a proposed law which would have liberalized the
 conditions for facilitating acquisition of permanent residence
 in Switzerland. Efforts are also being made to revise the law
 on asylum in order to improve the standing of refugees.
 Women, who were granted a federal franchise in 1971, continue
 to make progress in achieving equal status with men in public
 life. They remain, however, under-represented in business and
 public occupations. As a follow-up to the June 1981 national
 referendum which approved the draft constitutional amendment
 calling for equality between the sexes in family relations,
 education and at work, the parliament is elaborating individual
 bills which would also guarantee full equality with respect to
 pay and property rights.
 Both the federal Government and the cantons provide funds to
 ensure that cultural events are recognized and made available
 to the Swiss people. An area of concern remains the linguistic
 minorities. From time to time representatives of these groups
 express fear that the cultural traditions of their groups do
 not receive adequate support. The federal Government, always
 sensitive to the delicate balance of Swiss society, has been
 trying to resolve problems affecting linguistic minorities.
