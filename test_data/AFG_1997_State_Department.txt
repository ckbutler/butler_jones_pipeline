 AFGHANISTAN
 Afghanistan in 1997 continued to experience civil war and political instabiity.1
 There was no central government. The Pashtun-dominated ultra-conservative Is-
 lamic movement known as the Taliban controlled over two-thirds of the country, in-
 cluding Kabul, the capital and largest city. General Abdul Rashid Dostam, an ethnic
 Uzbek, controlled several north-central provinces, having driven out his rival Uzbek
 commander, General Abdul Malik. The Hezb-i-Wahdat faction led by Usted Karim
 Khalili, composed of the Shi'a Hazara ethnic minority, controlled Bamiyan and parts
 of eight surrounding provinces in the mountainous center of the country, which is
 known as the Hazarajat. Former President Burhanuddin Rabbani and his military
 commander, Ahmed Shah Masood, both Tajiks, controlled only three northeastern
 provinces. Masood's forces, however, continue to threaten Taliban-held Kabul and
 remain within rocket range of the city. At year's end, there was a rough military
 stalemate following the failure of the Taliban to take Mazar-i-Sharif, the last major
 city remaining outside of their control, on two separate occasions. The Taliban, how-
 ever, remained the countrs primary military force.
 Years of conflict have left hundreds of thousands of Afghans as internally dis-
 placed persons, and more than 2A million live outside the country as refugees. Al-
 though the continued fighting has discouraged many refugees from returning to
 their country, 84,400 returned in 1997.
 The U.N. Special Mission to Afghanistan, headed by Norbert Holl, was unable to
 secure a ceasefire among the factions, despite intense effort. Holl announced plans
 to resign at the end of the year and a replacement has not yet been named. In Au-
 gust the U.N. Secretary General appointed Algerian diplomat Lakhdar Brahimi as
 his Special Envoy for Afghanistan. Brahimi has engaged in extensive discussions
 with the Afghan parties and other interested nations. In October he convoked a
 group of representatives from the six nations bordering Afghanistan plus the United
 States andRussia to look at ways in which to end the conflict. His efforts continue.
 There is no constitution, rule of law, or independent judiciary. Former President
 Rabbani claimed to be the head of the Government and controlled most of the coun-
 try's embassies abroad and retained Afghanistan's U.N. seat after the U.N. General
 Assembly deferred a decision on Afghanistan's credentials. In October the Taliban
 changed the name of the country to the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan, with
 Mullah Omar, who had previously assumed the religious title of Emir of the Faith-
 ful, as head of state. There is a six-member ruling council in Kabul but ultimate
 authority for Taliban rule rested in the Taliban's inner Shura (Council), located in
 the southern city of Kandahar, and in Mullah Omar. In Taliban areas, strict and
 oppressive order is imposed and stiff punishments for crimes prevail. Several pro-
 vincial administrations maintained limited functions but civil institutions were
 mostly nonexistent. There was some administration in the areas under the control
 of Dostam or Hezb-i-Wahdat, but law and order is enforced, largely arbitrarily, by
 local commanders. The ethnic Tajik-majority areas of the northeast were controlled
 by Masood's commanders and his political organization.
 Agrculture, including high levels of opium poppy cultivation, was the mainstay
 of the economy. Afghanistan remained the second largest opium producer in the
 world. Lack of resources and the war have impeded reconstruction of irrigation sys-
 tems, repair of market roads, and replanting of orchards in some areas. The pres-
 ence of an estimated 10 million land mines has restricted areas for cultivation and
 slowed the return of refugees who are needed to rebuild the economy. The laying
 of new mine fields, reportedly mostly by the Northern Alliance, exacerbated an al-
 ready difficult situation. Trade was mainly in fruits, minerals, and gems, as well

 Information on the human rights situation is therefore limited.

 as goods smuggled to Pakistan. There are also rival currencies, both very inflated.
 Formal economic activity remained minimal and was inhibited by recurrent fighting
 and roads blocked by local commanders. These blockages were removed in territory
 taken by the Taliban. Reconstruction was continuing in Herat, Kandahar, and
 Ghazni, areas which are under firm Taliban control. Reconstruction in some north-
 ern areas, including Balkh province, was largely reversed by fighting during the
 summer and fall. The northern areas all suffered from brigandage.
 The overall human rights situation is poor. Serious human rights violations con-
 tinued to occur and citizens were precluded from changing their government peace-
 fully. Political killings, torture, rape, arbitrary detention, looting, abductions and
 kidnapings for ransom were committed by armed units, local commanders, and
 rogue individuals. Prison conditions were poor. Various factions infringed on citi-
 zens' privacy rights. Summary justice was common. The Taliban's Islamic courts
 and religious police, the Department to Propagate Virtue and Eliminate Vice, en-
 forced their extreme interpretation of Islamic punishments, such as public execu-
 tions for adultery or murder and amputations of one hand and one foot for theft.
 For other infractions, Taliban militiamen often decided right or wrong and meted
 out punishments such as beatings on the spot. Civil war conditions and the unfet-
 tered actions of competing factions effectively limited the freedoms of speech, press,
 assembly, association, religion, and movement.
 Both Taliban and anti-Taliban forces were responsible for the indiscriminate bom-
 bardment of civilian areas. Taliban forces fired rockets and shelled Mazar-i-Sharif,
 reportedly causing hundreds of casualties. Dostam's forces bombed Kabul in Janu-
 ary, and Masood's forces continue to bombard Kabul, though probably with less ef-
 fect.
 Violence against women remained a problem, although the imposition of Taliban
 control in rural areas resulted in reduced incidents of rape, kidnaping, and forced
 marriage. There was widespread discrimination against women and girls, and the
 condition of women and girls in Herat and Kabul, poor to begin with, worsened sig-
 nificantly after the Taliban captured these cities in 1995 and 1996. The Taliban im-
 posed strict dress codes and prohibited women from working outside the home ex-
 cept in limited circumstances in the health care field. Girls generally were prohib-
 ited from attending school in Kabul and other urban areas, however, the Taliban
 continued to permit a few girls' schools to operate in Kandahar. However, the impo-
 sition of Taliban control in rural areas resulted in reduced incidents of rape, kidnap-
 ing, and forced marriage. Worker rights were not defined.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were a number of politically
 motivated killings by several parties. The world press reported the discovery in No-
 vember of mass graves near Shibarghan in northern Afghanistan, which contained
 an alleged 2000 corpses, reportedly of Taliban forces captured near Mazar-i-Sharif
 in May and executed by Northern Alliance forces. The U.N. and the International
 Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) were continuing an investigation at year's end.
 Intrafactional fighting between forces loyal to Malik and those loyal to Dostam
 reportedly resulted in some deaths before Dostam's forces expelled Malik from the
 country. Dostam and Malik have an ongoing dispute and Malik suspects Dostam of
 complicity in the death of his brother, Rasul Pahlawan, in June 1996. Some of
 Masood's commanders reportedly tortured persons to death (see Section 1.c.).
 In other areas, combatants sought to kill rival commanders and their sympathiz-
 ema. The perpetrators of these killings and their motives were difficult to identify,
 as political motives are often entwined with family and tribal feuds, battles over the
 drg trade, and personal vendettas.
 The Tahiban used swift summary trials and implemented strict punishments ac-
 cording to Islamic law; the Taliban ordered public executions and death by stoning
 (see Sections 1.c. and i.e.). In October Taliban militia displayed the corpses of four
 former Taliban fighters at two Kabul intersections hanging from beams about 10
 feet off the ground. They had been executed for accepting bribes from the opposition
 and money was stuffed in their mouths and nostrils and draped around their necks.
 One corpse reportedly was visibly bruised and bloodied. This was reminiscent of the
 September 1996 pubic execution of former Afghan leader Najibuliah and his broth-
 erby Taliban forces when they occupied Kabul.
 b. Disappearance.-Abductions, kidnapings, or hostage-taking for ransom or politi-
 cal reasons occurred in non-Taliban areas, but specific information was lacking. The
 strict security enforced by the Taliban in areas under their control has resulted in
 a decrease in such crimes.
 
 
 1607
 There were unconfirmed reports of girls and young women being kidnaped by
 local commanders. Some of the women were then reportedly forced to marry their
 kidnapers. Others simply remained missing. To avoid this danger, some families re-
 ,portedly sent their daughters to Pakistan or to Iran. Some families also sent girls
 abroad for education in order to evade the Taliban's prohibitions on females attend-
 ing school in most urban areas (see Section 5).
 Groups in Russia listed nearly 300 Soviet soldiers formerly serving in Afghanistan
 as missing in action or prisoners of war (POW's). Most were thought to be dead or
 to have voluntarily assimilated into Afghan society, though some are alleged to be
 held against their will. A number of persons from the former Soviet Union missing
 from the period of the Soviet occupation are presumed dead.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 All Afghan factions are believed to have used torture against opponents and POW's,
 though specific information is generally lacking. Torture does not appear to be a
 routine practice in all cases. Some of Masood's commanders in the north reportedly
 used torture routinely to extract information from and break the will of prisoners
 and political opponents; some of the victims were said to have been tortured to
 death.
 The Taliban ruled strictly in areas they controlled, establishing ad hoc and rudi-
 mentary judicial systems. Taliban courts imposed their extreme interpretation of Is-
 lamic laws and punishments following swift summary trials. Murderers were sub-
 jected to public executions (see Section l.a.) and thieves had a limb or two (one
 hand, one foot) severed. Adulterers were stoned to death.
 Prison conditions are poor. Prisoners held by some factions are not given food, as
 normally this is the responsibility of prisoners' relatives who are allowed to visit to
 provide them with food once or twice a week. Those who have no relatives have to
 petition the local council or rely on other inmates. Prisoners live in collective cells.
 There are credible reports that torture occurred occasionally in prisons under the
 control of both the Taliban and the Northern Alliance. Local authorities maintain
 prisons in territories under their control and established torture cells in some of
 them. The Taliban operate prisons in Kandahar, Herat, Kabul, and Jalalabad. There
 are also prisons in the north in Mazar-i-Sharif and Faizabad, Badakhshan province.
 According to Amnesty International (Al), there were unconfirmed reports that some
 Taliban prisoners held by Masood have been forced to labor in life-threatening con-
 ditions, such as digging trenches in mined areas.
 During 1997 the U.N. Special Rapporteur for Human Rights in Afghanistan vis-
 ited prisoners in Taliban-run jails in Kandahar and Kabul. He also visited prisoners
 in the north in the National Islamic Movement of Afghanistan (NIMA)-controlled
 area. Taliban authorities allowed the ICRC to visit detainees in areas under their
 control, but such visits were curtailed by the NIMA faction controlled by General
 Malik of the Northern Alliance. However, by the end of 1997, with Malik's depar-
 ture from Afghanistan, all major Northern Alliance factions allowed the ICRC ac-
 cess to their prisoners. The ICRC assisted the factions in improving sanitary condi-
 tions in the prisons, providing medicine and medical supplies and distributing win-
 ter clothing. The ICRC reportedly has information on about 5,700 prisoners held by
 the warring factions and performed about 8,000 prisoners visits during 1997, some-
 times seeing the sameprisoners more than once.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-With the absence of formal legal and law
 enforcement institutions, justice was not administered according to formal legal
 codes. There are credible reports of both Taliban and Northern Alliance militia ex-
 torting bribes from civilians in return for their release from prison or freedom from
 arrest. Judicial and police procedures varied from locality to locality. Little is known
 about the procedures for taking persons into custody and bringing them to justice.
 In both Taliban and non-Taliban areas, the practices varied depending on the local-
 ity, the local commanders, and other authorities. Some areas have more of a judicial
 structure than others.
 There are reliable reports of individuals detained by both the Northern Alliance
 and the Taliban because of their ethnic origins and suspected sympathy with oppo-
 nents. In August Taliban police in Kabul raided a minority neighborhood and re-
 portedly arrested over 100 men, claiming that they were loyal to Masood. Taliban
 officials denied that the men were arrested because of their ethnic status, but sev-
 eral observers reported that mass arrests of Uzbeks, Hazara, and Tajiks on sus-
 picion of fifth column activities increased in frequency during this period.
 There also have been reported instances of the forcible expulsion of individuals
 on ethnic grounds. The Taliban reportedly expelled the inhabitants of the town of
 Charikar in January, forced villagers from the Shomali valley in June, and report-
 edly ordered the removal of 1,500 Hazara villagers near Ghazni in December. Some
 
 
 I All
 observers expressed fear about persecution of northern Pashtun in retaliation for
 northern Pashtun coamanders allying themselves with the Taliban.
 Political detainee. probably are held by all factions, but no firm numbers are
 available. The Taliban claimed to have freed over 3,000 prisoners during the past
 3 years. In November the ICRC reported th it 600 former Rabbani/Masood soldiers
 were held by the Taliban. Masood reportedly holds several hundred Taliban soldiers
 as POW's _ s well as a number of Pakistanis. There were many prisoner releases
 during November and Decer-ber, Dostam freed over 600 Taliban prisoners, and
 there were limited exchanges occurring between Masood, Khalili, and the Taliban.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-With no functioning nationwide judicial system,
 many municipal and provincial authorities relied on some form of Shari'a (Islamic)
 law and traditional tribal codes of justice.
 Little is known about the administration of justice in the areas controlled by
 Dostam and Rabbani/Masood in the northern provinces. The administration and im-
 plementation of justice varied from area to area and depended on the whims of local
 commanders or other authorities, who summarily execute, torture, and mete out
 punishments without reference to any other authority.
 The Taliban have Islamic courts in areas under their control to judge criminal
 cases and resolve disputes. These courts meted out punishments including execution
 and amputation. These courts reportedly heard cases in sessions that lasted only a
 few minutes. The courts reportedly dealt with all complaints, relying on Islamic law
 and punishments as well as traditional tribal customs (see Section 1.c.). In cases in-
 volving murder and rape, convicted prisoners generally were ordered executed by
 relatives of the victim (see Section L.a.), who could instead choose to accept other
 restitution. Decisions of the courts were reportedly final.
 Shi'a Islamic legal norms reportedly are imposed in the Hazarajat in central Af-
 ghanistan. According to the October report of the U.N. Special Rapporteur for
 Human Rights in Afghanistan (see Section 4), the Shi'a Unity Party (Hezb-i-
 Wahdat) in Bamiyan province has established a Judicial Committee. The Committee
 has a prosecutor's office composed of thre6 branches for political, military, and social
 offenders. There were also courts of the first and the final instance.
 All factions probably hold political prisoners, but no firm estimates of numbers
 are available.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-Inter-
 factional fighting often resulted in the homes and businesses of civilians being in-
 vaded and looted by the opposing forces-whether victor or loser. Armed gunmen
 reportedly acted with impunity given the absence of any legal protection from the
 law or a responsive police force. There were confirmed reports of massive looting by
 Northern Alliance forces of private, U.N. and NGO property during the fighting in
 the area of Mazar-i-Sharif in September and October. It also was unclear what au-
 thority controlled the actions of Taliban militiamen who patrolled the streets of
 cities and towns. A number of incidents were reported in which Taliban soldiers or
 persons masquerading as Taliban entered private homes without prior notification
 or informed consent in Kabul, Herat, Kandahar, and elsewhere. In Kabul the sol-
 diers allegedly were searching homes for evidence of cooperation with the former au-
 thorities or for violations of Taliban religious-based decrees, including depictions of
 living things (photographs, stuffed toys, etc.) Individuals were beaten on the streets
 by Taliban militia for what were deemed infractions of Taliban rules concerning
 dress, hair length, and facial hair, as well as for restriction on women being in the
 company of men. The Taliban required women to wear strict Islamic garb in public
 (see Section 5).
 It was reported that some prisoners of the Taliban, including young sons of fami-
 lies that had opposed Taliban social restrictions, had been forcibly drafted and sent
 to the front. There were also unconfirmed reports in July and August of youths
 being rounded up and sent into combat.
 g. Use of Excessive Force and Violations of Humanitarian Law In Internal Con-
 fiicts.-On September 11 and 13 Masood's forces fired rockets in heavy attacks on
 Kabul and struck civilian-inhabited areas. Several noncombatants were killed, in-
 cluding a 10-year-old girl, and many more were wounded. Dostam's planes dropped
 several cluster bombs on Kabul on January 5, killing and injuring several persons.
 Taliban bombardment of Mazar-i-Sherif during the fighting there also caused civil-
 ian casualties, as did the Taliban attack upon Hayratan, on the Amu Darya River.
 During this attack, some Taliban rockets overshot their target and fell on a suburb
 of the Uzbek city of Termez, across the border, kiln  two civilians and wounding
 others. The Tahan aso ombed Bamiyan airport on     ecember 31, an attack that
 led the United Nations to suspend its food airlift to the Hazarajat.
 The U-N. Special Rapporteur is investigating reports of a September 14 massacre
 of Hazara villagers near Mazar-i-Sharif in which abut 70 civilians were killed. Eye-
 
 
 1609
 witnesses reported numerous atrocities by Taliban forces. The Taliban denied these
 charges and claimed that civilian deaths, if any, resulted from combat. The Special
 Rapporteur also is investigating the massacre of Taliban POWs and others by
 Northern Alliance forces after the May fighting near Mazar-i-Sharif.
 There were reports in November that the Taliban-imposed blockade on the
 Hazarajat region ruled by Hezb-i-Wahdat had pushed the population (of about 1
 million) to the "verge of starvation," according to U.N. sources. The U.N. had hoped
 to supply the region from the north, but U.N. food stocks in Mazar-i-Sharif had been
 looted during the fighting in September and October and convoys from the north
 also had been blocked or were in danger of being looted by individual Northern Alli-
 ance commanders. The passes were expected to be closed during the winter, further
 aggravating the situation. Many families reportedly were leaving the area following
 the Taliban's refusal to lift the blockade, further adding to the problem of internal
 displacement. The Taliban have said that they would provide for the needs of per-
 sons in Herat or Kandahar.
 Many hundreds of thousands of Afghans remain internally displaced persons fol-
 lowing years of fighting. More than 2.4 million others have sought refuge abroad.
 The Afghan countryside remains plagued by an estimated 10 million land mines
 sown during and since the Soviet occupation. Some 400,000 Afghans have been
 killed or wounded by the mines. Some 80 percent of the land mine casualties are
 civilian and 40 to 50 percent are women and children. With funding from inter-
 national donors, the United Nations has organized and trained mine detection and
 clearance teams, which operated throughout the country. Nevertheless, the mines
 are expected to pose a threat for years to come and the 4,000 mine clearers suffer
 an accident rate of one per week. There were reliable reports of minelaying activi-
 ties, largely by the Northern Alliance. U.N. agencies and nongovernmental organiza-
 tions (NGO's) have instituted a number of mine awareness campaigns and edu-
 cational programs for women and children in various parts of the country, but many
 were curtailed as a result of Taliban restrictions on women and girls.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-There are no laws effectively providing for free-
 dom of speech and the press. Senior officials of various warring factions allegedly
 attempted to intimidate reporters and influence their reporting. The few news-
 papers, all of which were published only sporadically, were for the most part affili-
 ated with different factions. The various factions maintain their own communica-
 tions facilities. The Taliban took over the pro-Rabbani radio service in Kabul and
 renamed it the Voice of Shariat. The Taliban banned television on religious grounds.
 All factions have attempted to pressure foreign journalists reporting on the Af-
 ghan conflict. The Taliban initially cooperated with the international press who ar-
 rived in Kabul but later imposed restrictions upon them. On September 29, journal-
 ists accompanying European Union Commissioner Emma Bonino, and the Commis-
 sioner herself, were detained for 3 hours in Kabul after they entered a hospital for
 women and began filming in violation of the Taliban rule against photographing liv-
 ing things. The television crews agreed to turn over their cassettes to the Taliban
 authorities. A Taliban official later expressed apologies for the arrest.
 The Taliban reportedly require most journalists to stay at the Intercontinental
 Hotel in Kabul (allegedly for security and economic reasons). Journalists also re-
 ported that the Taliban attempted to control who could act as drivers and inter-
 preters for journalists.
 Music, movies, and television continue to be prohibited by the Taliban. Television
 functioned sporadically in Mazar-i-Sharif.
 The Taliban severely restrict academic freedom, particularly education for girls
 (see Section 5).
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-Civil war, tenuous security,
 and likely opposition from local authorities seriously inhibited freedom of assembly
 and association.
 It is unknown whether laws exist governing the formation of associations. Many
 Afghan NGO's remain operating in the country (see Section 4).
 c. Freedom of Religion.-Afghanistan's official name, according to beth the Taliban
 (Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan) and the Northern Alliance (the Islamic State of Af-
 ghanistan), reflects the country's adherence to Islam as the state religion. Some 85
 percent of the population is Sunni Muslim, and Shi'a Muslims constitute most of
 the remainder. The Hazara ethnic group is Shi'a; Shi'as are among the most eco-
 nomically disadvantaged persons in the country. The Shi'a minority want a national
 government to give them equal rights as citizens.
 The Taliban sought to impose their extreme interpretation of Islamic observance
 in areas that they control. The Taliban regularly check passersby to see that men's
 
 
 1610
 beards and apparel meet Taliban requirements and to ensure that women are
 dressed in strict Islamic garb (see Section 5). According to regulations a man who
 has shaved or cut his beard may be imprisoied until his beard grows back. Beards
 must protrude farther than would a fist clamped at the base oT the chin. Several
 civil service employees were reportedly fired for cutting their beards. There also are
 credible reports that Taliban gave forced haircuts to males in Kabul.
 The small number of non-Muslim residents in Afghanistan may practice their
 faith, but may not proselytize. Almost all of the country's small 1indu and Sikh
 population, which once numbered about 50,000, has emigrated or taken refuge
 abroad. Some Taliban leaders claimed tolerance of religious minorities, although
 there reportedly have been restrictions imposed upon Shi'a in Taliban-controlled ter-
 ritory, though not on a uniform basis. The Taliban have declared that all Muslims
 must abide by the Taliban's interpretation of Islamic law. There is also a report that
 a Christian church in Kabul was taken over by Taliban authorities and turned into
 a mosque.
 d. Feedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-Although in principle citizens have the right to travel freely both inside
 and outside the country, their ability to travel within the country was hampered by
 warfare, brigandage, millions of land mines, a road network in a state of disrepair,
 and limited domestic air service, complicated by factional threats to air traffic. De-
 spite these obstacles, many people continued to travel relatively freely, with buses
 piying routes in most parts of the country. Security conditions have improved along
 roads in Taliban-controlled areas. However, due to intermittent fighting in various
 areas, international aid agencies often found that their ability to travel, work, and
 distribute assistance was hampered. International travel continued to be difficult as
 both parties threatened to shoot down any planes that overflew areas of the country
 that they controlled, without their permission.
 Commercial trade was impeded in certain non-Taliban areas, as local commanders
 continued to demonstrate their control over the roads by demanding road tolls and
 sometimes closing roads. Roads leading to Bamiyan rovince form Pul-i-Khumri re-
 portedly contain dozens of checkpoints controlle by ocal commanders, with travel-
 ers sometimes subject to extortion.
 There also have been reported instances of the forcible expulsion of individuals
 on ethnic grounds. The Taliban reportedly expelled the inhabitants of the town of
 Charikar in January, forced villagers from the Shomali valley in June, and report-
 edly ordered the removal of 1,500 Hazara villagers near Ghazni in December. Some
 observers expressed fear about persecution of northern Pashtun in retaliation for
 northern Pashtun commanders allying themselves with the Taliban.
 Afghans continued to form one ofthe world's largest refugee populations. Accord-
 ing to the UNHCR, about 2.4 million Afghans remained outside the country in 1996
 as registered refugees. Women and children constituted some 75 percent of the refu-
 gee population. There are 1.4 million registered Afghan refugees in Iran, 1 million
 in Pakistan, and 28,000 are in Russia. Approximately 19,000 reside in parts of the
 former Soviet Union other than Russia, and Pakistan has claimed an additional
 500,000 unregistered Afghan refugees in its territory. Over 3.8 million Afghan refu-
 gees have been repatriated since 1988, with over 1.5 million returning to Afghani-
 stan in the peak year of 1992. A total of 84,400 returned in 1997
 According to the UNHCR, the last remaining 18,800 refugees from Tajikistan
 were repatriated to Tajikistan during the year with the cooperation of the Northern
 Alliance and the Government of Uzbekistan, which allowed the refugees to transit
 that country on their way home. Many refugees were at a camp near Mazar-i-Sharif
 and were faced with food and water shortages after the evacuation of U.N. staff dur-
 ing the fighting in the region in September and October. Some refugees were
 wounded during the ongoing conflict in the region.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 There was no functioning central government in the country. The continuing
 struggle for political power among the major armed groups prevented citizens from
 changing their government or form of government peacefully and democratically.
 Most political changes came about through shifting military fortunes. No faction
 held elections or respected the right to change government democratically.
 The Northern Alliance, headed by nominal President Rabbani, holds power with
 de facto Defense Minister Masood as Rabbani's primary military backer. Rabbani
 received nominal support from General Malik (until he was driven out of Afghani-
 stan), from General Dostam, and the Shi's/Hazara Hezb-i-Wahdat. Rabbani and
 Masood control the northeastern, largely Tajik, portion of the country, including the
 strategic Panjshir valley north of Kabul. Dostam and Malik share nominal control
 
 
 1611
 of five to six north central provinces, while the Shi'alHazara Hezb-i-Wahdat, led by
 Khalii, controls the Hazarajat to the west of Kabul.
 Although there are governors and local councils in the north, most power there
 is concentrated in the hands.of Dostam, Malik, Khalili, and their key commanders.
 Masood retains control in the northeastern ethnic Tajik-majority provinces through
 his commanders and political organization. The Taliban controlled the remaining
 two-thirds of the country, including Kabul. However, discontent with Taliban stric-
 tures and village values was strong in large, non-Pashtun cities such as Herat and
 Kabul. The key Taliban governing body is the Inner Shura (council) based in
 Kandahar, which is headed by Mullah Omar, although there is a government of a
 sort, with its ministries based in Kabul.
 During the last half of the year a group of independent Afghans attempted to
 begin an intra-Afghan process of dialogue aimed at bringing peace to Afghanistan
 through the convening of a loya jirga (grand council) representing all Afghans. The
 group held preliminary meetings in Frankfurt and in Istanbul and received support
 for its initiative from the Northern Alliance, however, the Taliban did not partici-
 pate. In November former King Zahir Shah declared from his residence in exile in
 Rome that he was prepared to return to Afghanistan and discuss the formation of
 an interim government to end the conflict. The Taliban reaction, was ambivalent,
 both to the idea of a possible role for the former King and to the dialogue process.
 The United Nations and the international community continued their efforts to
 help Afghans reach a political settlement.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 There are many local NGO's.-Some-are based in neighboring countries, mostly
 Pakistan, with branches inside -Afghanistan; others are based in Afghan cities. The
 focus of their activities is- primarily humanitarian assistance, rehabilitation, health,
 education, and agriculture.
 There was harassment of NGO's both factions. NGO facilities in Mazar-i-Sharif
 were looted by Northern Alliance forces in September and October, and fighters
 were observed driving around the city in stolen NGO-owned vehicles. There are also
 numerous examples of Taliban harassment of NGO personnel. In November in
 Jalalabad two male Afghan United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) employees
 were detained and one was given 10 lashes before a crowd. UNICEF termed this
 incident "an unacceptable affront to the most fundamental principles of humani-
 tarianism." The Taliban detained two French NGO employees for over a month after
 they attended a party at which Afghan women were present. Male Afghan NGO em-
 ployees who attended- the event received prison sentences. On September 3, the
 Taliban expelled three U.N. foreign staff members after they protested Taliban de-
 mands that visiting female U.N. officials sit behind a screen during a meeting with
 Taliban officials. In November the Taliban also began pressing NGO's and inter-
 national organizations to hire Taliban and report on their level of funding from do-
 nors. In November, Taliban authorities detained the director of a Pakistan-based Af-
 ghan NGO and demanded that the NGO surrender its construction equipment and
 move its operations to parts of Afghanistan under Taliban control.
 There were incidents of harassment of Afghan and foreign NGO female employ-
 ees, including an assault upon a foreigner in Herat, and reported refusals to meet
 with female visitors.
 The Afghan League of Human Rights operated both-in Afghanistan and Pakistan;
 it produces an annual report. The Cooperation Center for Afghanistan (CCA) is an
 Afghan NGO that operated in both Pakistan and Afghanistan. The CCA maintains
 an office in Peshawar, where it produces a monthly newsletter on the Afghan
 human rights situation. It also monitors and documents the human rights situation
 from several offices in both Taliban-controlled and Northern Alliance-controlled
 cities. However, the civil war and lack of security continued to make it difficult for
 human rights organizations to adequately monitor the situation inside the country.
 The U.N. Special Advisor on Gender Issues, Assistant Secretary General Angela
 King, visited Afghanistan in November to review U.N. policy toward women and aid
 in Afghanistan.
 The U.N. Special Rapporteur for Human Rights in Afghanistan, Dr. Choong-hyun
 Paik, visited both Taliban and Northern Alliance- controlled portions of the country
 during 1997. His mandate was extended again by the UN Human Rights Commis-
 sion. In his 1997 report, the Rapporteur declared that Afghan citizens continue to
 be deprived of basic rights and freedoms.

 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 There are no constitutional provisions that prohibit discrimination based on race,
 sex, religion, disability, language, or social status. It is not known whether specific
 laws prohibit discrimination; local custom and practices generally prevail. Discrimi-
 nation against women is prevalent throughout the country and its severity varies
 from area to area, depending on the local leadership's attitude towards work and
 education for women and on local attitudes. Historically, the minority Shi'a faced
 discrimination from the majority Sunni population. There has been greater accept-
 ance of the disabled as the number of people maimed by land mines increased and
 the presence of the disabled became more prevalent.
 Women.-As lawlessness and interfactional fighting continued in some areas, vio-
 lence against women occurred frequently, including beatings, rapes, forced mar-
 riages,  sapearances, kidnapings, and killings. Such incidents generally went un-
 reported and most information was anecdotal. It was difficult to document rapes,
 in particular, given the social stigma that surrounds the problem. Although the sta-
 bility instituted by the Taliban in most of the country initially acted to reduce vio-
 lence against women, there were reports during the year of Taliban stealing others'
 wives for an evening.
 Under the Communist regime of the 1980's, a growing number of women, particu-
 larly in urban areas, worked outside the home in nontraditional roles. This trend
 was reversed when the Communists were ousted in 1992, and an Islamic govern-
 ment was installed. In 1997 the trend towards excluding women from public service
 intensified, although some women retained employment as artisans, weavers, doc-
 tors, and nurses in some areas. In northern Afghanistan and pre-Taliban controlled
 Kabul, women were allowed to work and girls to attend school.
 The harsh treatment of women under Taliban rule has received strong criticism
 throughout the world. When the Taliban took Kabul in September 1996, they imme-
 diately issued pronouncements forbidding women to work, including female doctors
 and nurses in hospitals and required that houses with female occupants have their
 windows painted over. In a few cases, the Taliban relented and allowed women to
 work in health care occupations under restricted circumstances. Taliban gender re-
 strictions continued to interfere with the delivery of humanitarian assistance to
 women and girls. In a July letter addressed to the U.N., the Taliban asked that as-
 sistance be provided to women through their close male relatives rather than di-
 rectly. Male relatives also must obtain the permission of the Department for the
 Propagation of Virtue and the Suppression of Vice for female home-based employ-
 ment.
 In January the Taliban announced a policy of segregating men and women in hos-
 pitals. This regulation largely was ignored or6 mont hs, but in July hospital direc-
 tors were directed to cease services to women and discharge female staff. Services
 for women were to be provided by a single hospital still partially under construc-
 tion-a drastic reduction in the access to, and quality of, care for women. This order
 was being implemented in September but was modified on September 20 to allow
 for emergency care for women at all hospitals. On November 6, however, the
 Taliban reversed their decision, and the Kabul Caretaker Council repealing the de-
 cree. The Council provided for nonemergency treatment for women at eight Kabul
 hospitals and restated that women could be seen at any Kabul hospital in an emer-
 gency. In October an NGO reported that a female burn victim had died after
 Taliban authorities would not allow her to be treated by a male doctor. Health care
 for both men and women was further hampered by the ban on images of humans
 issued over Radio Shari'a on October 6, which caused the destruction of public edu-
 cation posters and hampered the provision of health information in a society with
 massive illiteracy.
 The Taliban decreed what women could wear in public. Women were forced to don
 a head-to-toe garment known as the chador, which has only a mesh screen for vi-
 sion. While in some conservative areas, this was the normal garment for rural
 women, it represented a dramatic change in practice when imposed in urban areas.
 According to a decree announced by the religious police in January, women found
 outside the home who were not properly covered would be severely punished along
 with their family elders. In Kabul and elsewhere women found in public who were
 not wearing the chador were beaten by Taliban militiamen. A few reports indicated
 that some women in Herat are covering their heads with large scarves that leave
 the face uncovered and have not faced reprisals, and many women in rural areas
 also have been observed without chadors but with scarves covering .their heads. It
 is also reported that these restrictions are not enforced upon the nomad population
 of several hundred thousand or upon foreigners.

 The appearance and movement of women in public was further curtailed, even
 with approved clothing. Observers reported seeing fewer and fewer women on the
 streets in Taliban-controlled areas.
 In the north, NIMA also har increased restrictions upon women. It has requested
 that NGO's operating in areas under its control fire female employees, and Balkh
 University reportedly haa segregated classes and barred females from teaching male
 students.
 Children.-Local administrative bodies and international assistance organizations
 undertook to look out for children's welfare to the extent possible; however, the situ-
 ation of children is very poor. Infant mortality is 250 out of 1,000 births and
 Medecins Sans Frontiers reports that 250,000 children peryear die of malnutrition.
 A UNICEF study also reported that the majority of Afghan children are highly trau-
 matized and expect to die before reaching adulthood. Some 90 percent have night-
 mares and suffer from acute anxiety, while some 70 percent have seen acts of vio-
 lence, including the killing of parents or relatives.
 Taliban restrictions on the movement of women and girls in areas that they con-
 trolled hampered the ability of U.N. agencies and NGO's to implement effectively
 health and education programs aimed at both boys- and girls. In Kabul in October,
 six women and children suffering from malnutrition and en route to a food center,
 accompanied by two health workers, reportedly were forced to- leave their vehicle
 and halt their journey after the Taliban stopped the driver and gave him 25 lashes
 for allowing one of the women to ride in the front seat.
 The Taliban have eliminated most of the opportunities-for girls'.education that ex-
 isted in areas they have taken over. Some girls reportedly are receiving an edu-
 cation in informal home schools, which are tolerated by theTaliban authorities in
 various parts of the country. It also is -reported that several, girls', schools remain
 open in Kandahar, although in Herat, which was captured by the Taliban in 1995,
 girls' schools have remained closed except in the refugee camps maintained by inter-
 national NGO's. Prior to the Taliban takeover in 1996, more than 100,000 girls re-
 portedly attended public school in Kabul in grades kindergarten to 12, according to
 a U.N. survey.
 People With Disabilities.-There are few measures to protect the rights of the
 mentally and physically disabled or to mandate accessibility for them Victims of
 -land mines continued to be a major focus of international humanitarian relief orga-
 nizations, which devoted resources to providing prostheses, medical treatment, and
 rehabilitation therapy to amputees. It is believed that there was more public accept-
 ance of people with disabilities because of the prevalence of the maimed due to land
 mines or other war-related injuries. There are reports that disabled women, who
 need a prosthesis or other aid to walk, are virtually homebound because they cannot
 wear the chador over the prosthesis or other aid.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Little is known about labor laws and practices, al-
 though only an insignificant fraction of the work force has ever labored in an indus-
 trial setting. There were no reports of labor rallies or strikes. Labor rights are not
 defined, and in the context of the breakdown of governmental authority there is no
 effective central authority to enforce them. Many of Kabul's industrial workers are
 unemployed due to the destruction or abandonment of the city's minuscule manufac-
 turing base. The only large employer in Kabul is the governmental structure of
 minimally functioning ministries.
 Workers in government ministries reportedly have been fired because they have
 received part of their education abroad or because of contacts with the previous re-
 gimes, although certain officials in previous administrations still are employed
 under the Taliban. Others have reportedly been fired for violating Taliban regula-
 tions concerning beard length.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Afghanistan lacks a tradition
 of genuine labor-management bargaining. There are no known labor courts or other
 mechanisms for resolving labor disputes.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Little information is available on
 forced or compulsory labor, including child labor. There are credible reports that
 Masood forced Taliban prisoners to work on road and air strip construction projects,
 but did not otherwise mistreat the prisoners.
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment.-There is
 no evidence that authorities in any part of the country enforce labor laws, if they
 exist, relating to the employment of children. Children from the ages of 6 to 14 often
 work to help support their families by herding animals in rural areas, and by col-
 lecting paper and firewood, shining shoes, begging, or collecting scrap metal among
 
 
 1614
 
 street debris in the cities. Some of these practices expose children to the danger of
 land mines.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-There is no available information regarding a
 statutory minimum wage or the enforcement of safe labor practices. Many workers
 are apparently allotted time off regularly for prayers and observance of religious
 holidays.
