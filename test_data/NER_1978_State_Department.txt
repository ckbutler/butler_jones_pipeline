 NIGER
 The armed forces of Niger seized control of the govern-
 ment in April 1974, claiming that corruption was
 widespread and that emergency measures were necessary
 to deal with the critical food situation. Upon taking
 power, the military Government suspended Niger's
 Constitution and placed restrictions on the freedom
 of expression, assembly and political activity.
 Several members of the former government remain under
 house arrest, but most have been released and several
 reinstated in government service. In April 1978 the
 Government released approximately twenty political
 prisoners, including several ranking members of the
 former government.
 Economic development remains the military Government's
 top priority. It has devoted considerable resources
 and energy to the most pressing needs of its people.
 Niger's pre-independence French legal system and
 practices have been left largely intact. French legal
 safeguards are respected in civil and criminal cases.
 The military Government still refers to itself as
 "provisional", but has not announced any schedule for
 return to civilian rule. In 1974 the national assembly
 was abolished and since then the executive branch has
 been directed by a Supreme Military Council.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 There are no reports of the use of torture in Niger.
 Although there are no legal sanctions against torture,
 offenders would probably be punished.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 There are no reports of such treatment or punishment
 (132)

 in Niger, nor is there evidence of arbitrary deprivation
 of life or inhumane prison conditions.
 c. Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 A few incidents of arrest and imprisonment without due
 process have occurred. Most involved members of the
 previous regime. Amnesty International reported in
 April 1978 that it had taken up the cases of fifteen
 persons who were accused of plotting against the
 Government and jailed without trial. The Department of
 State lacks information on the exact number of political
 prisoners detained without trial. The integrity of the
 person is not specifically guaranteed by law in Niger,
 since the military Government has suspended the Consti-
 tution and rules by decree.
 d. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The right to a fair public hearing and trial is observed
 in criminal and civil cases not involving political
 acts. Several plotters executed in connection with a
 March 1976 attempted coup were tried by a specially
 designated military court. There is no evidence
 suggesting that courts are subject to political influence
 or pressure in ordinary criminal or civil cases.
 e. Invasion of the Home
 The inviolability of the home is respected but not
 guaranteed, given the suspension of the Constitution.
 2. Governmental Policies Relating to the Fulfillment
 of Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care
 and Education
 The Government of Niger has made the fulfillment of
 basic human needs its first priority. Through its
 participation in the Permanent Interstate Committee for
 Drought Control in the Sahel, its allocation of consider-
 able foreign assistance and its application of its
 limited but growing national investment funds, the
 Government has signalled its strong commitment to
 improving the standard of living. Per capita government
 
 
 expenditures have risen from $13 per person in 1974 to
 $38 in 1978. The Government has sought to reduce the
 tax burden of its poorer citizens. Recently it abolished
 the so-called head tax, a particular hardship for those
 outside the cash economy. The Government continues to
 devote all of its uranium mining revenues to the
 National Investment Fund which is used exclusively to
 finance development activities identified in the
 National Development Plan (1976-78). One-third of this
 plan is allocated specifically for projects in health,
 agriculture and rural infrastructure. Since 1974, the
 defense share of the national budget has declined from
 8.2 percent to 6.3 percent.
 Niger's people have traditionally held personal ethics,
 justice and fair play in high regard. Corruption of
 government officials is not a serious problem and is
 swiftly dealt with when discovered. Working conditions
 and minimum wage levels (which concern the small but
 growing number of workers) reflect widely-held perceptions
 of equity.
 3. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Includ-
 ing:
 a. Freedom of Thought, Speech, Press, Religion
 and Assembly
 These freedoms are restricted in Niger. Dissent is
 rarely voiced openly. Some forms of voluntary associa-
 tions and expression such as trade unions, churches and
 other religious groups are, however, generally permitted.
 In at least one instance, the Government refused to
 issue permanent residence permits to evangelists of a
 religious sect. Trade unions follow closely government
 labor policy. The media are government-controlled, but
 there is a slight degree of editorial independence. The
 Government does not attempt to impose ideological or
 intellectual conformity.
 Racial and tribal differences pose no serious problems
 and are approached in a sensitive manner when disputes
 arise. Participation by women in government and
 commerce is small but growing, aided by government-
 
 
 135
 sponsored women's organizations and a gradual relaxation
 of traditional, conservative religious views.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel and Emigration
 There have been no reports of restrictions on movement
 within the country. Foreign travel and emigration from
 Niger require government concurrence in the form of an
 exit visa, which is given routinely.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Freedom to participate in the political process is
 restricted. The Supreme Military Council (SMC) which
 now directs the executive branch is comprised of the
 army officers who organized the 1974 coup. The President
 of the SMC is also Chief of State and President of the
 Council of Ministers. Members of the Government are
 sensitive to urban popular opinion and maintain a
 contact with remote rural populations through frequent
 official visits. The Government makes policy decisions
 by decree in what it seems to be the best interests of
 its people. Civilians now hold eleven of the seventeen
 positions in the cabinet.
 4. Government Attitude and Record Regarding Inter-
 national and Non-Governmental Investigation of
 Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 There have been no requests for outside investigations
 of human rights in Niger. Officials of the Government
 have discussed inquiries about the human rights situation
 with Amnesty International and stated that their
 replies have been prompt and forthcoming.
