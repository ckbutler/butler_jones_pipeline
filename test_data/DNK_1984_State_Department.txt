 DENMARK
 Denmark is a constitutional monarchy with a strongly
 established tradition of democratic parliamentary rule. A
 Cabinet headed by the Prime Minister and accountable to the
 unicameral Parliament (Folketing) has responsibility for
 government decisions. The 179 members of the Folketing are
 elected in free and open elections under a complex system of
 proportional representation designed to protect the rights of
 minority parties and to reflect the popular vote. Since late
 1982, Denmark has been governed by a 4-party minority
 coalition led by Prime Minister Schluter's Conservative Party,
 but it is dependent on support from other parties to maintain
 a parliamentary majority.
 Human rights are highly respected and well protected in
 Denmark, both in principle and in practice. The Danish
 Constitution contains provisions which allow one-third of the
 Folketing to demand that a law approved by Parliament be
 subjected to a popular referendum. The Constitution also
 establishes the Folketing's *Ombudsman,* to whom any citizen
 can protest if he or she feels wrongly or unreasonably treated
 by any Danish national or municipal authority. Women play a
 leading role in all aspects of public life. (The Danish
 Constitution was altered in 1953 to introduce the principle of
 female succession, and Queen Margrethe II ascended the throne
 in 1972.) Denmark has displayed high concern for the rights
 of minorities, particularly the indigenous populations of
 territories such as Greenland and the Faroe Islands, which now
 enjoy broad powers of home rule. At the global level, Denmark
 participates actively in a number of international commissions
 concerned with the protection and preservation of human rights.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 Danish authorities do not engage in political killings.
 b. Disappearance
 Abductions, secret arrests, and clandestine detentions are
 prohibited by statutes which are respected in practice.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Protection against torture and inhuman treatment is guaranteed
 by law and respected in practice. In 1983, a rehabilitation
 and fesearch center for torture victims was established in
 Copenhagen. The center, which was opened with a grant from
 the Carlsberg Foundation, is the first and only medical
 facility specializing in the treatment of physical and mental
 trauma associated with torture. The center has primarily
 limited its treatment to the refugee community. An estimated
 150 foreign torture victims obtain asylum in Denmark yearly.
 Most of those treated have come from Latin America, Africa,
 and Asia.

 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 No person in Denmark can be deprived of personal liberty
 without due process of law. Arrested individuals must be
 taken before a judge within 24 hours of detention. The judge
 has the authority to determine whether the person should be
 detained in pretrial custody or released pending trial. The
 Constitution makes provision for bail. Arrested individuals
 have access to legal counsel of their choice or
 court-appointed attorneys. Non-Danish speakers are provided
 with interpreters at government expense. The occasional use
 of isolation during the pretrial custody period has been
 criticized in the media. Police authorities maintain that
 isolation is necessary to protect the investigation, and the
 system continues to be used, though only in the most serious
 crimes such as narcotics violations.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Trials are fair and public. Exceptions to this principle may
 occur when ordered by the trial judge, who may do so only
 within narrowly drawn parameters. The most common exceptions
 in civil cases occur in paternity and divorce trials. In
 criminal cases, trials are only closed when it is necessary to
 protect the privacy of the victim, such as in rape or child
 molestation cases, or when it is deemed necessary to protect
 the identity of a witness. Danish courts make extensive
 efforts to obtain the facts of a case, and the rights of the
 accused are carefully protected. All indigent defendants in
 Denmark have the right to a court-appointed attorney at
 government expense. The defendant is free to change the
 court-appointed attorney.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Rome, or
 Correspondence
 Under the Danish Constitution, searches of the home, seizure
 and examination of papers, and breaches of the secrecy of
 communications are prohibited in the absence of a judicial
 order, unless a particular exception is provided for by
 statute. These provisions are respected in practice.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Denmark has a free and open society. An individual may
 express an opinion in written or oral form on any matter,
 subject only to the condition that the person can be held
 responsible in a court of law. Media representatives and
 private individuals make full use of the freedom of
 expression. Criticism of the Government or government policy
 is not a punishable offense, and censorship is not utilized.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Danish residents are free to assemble and form associations
 for any lawful purpose. Police are entitled to be present at
 public meetings or demonstrations which could constitute a
 danger to the public peace. Approximately 85 percent of
 Danish wage earners are members of trade unions. Under the
 General Agreement of 1960, workers and employers acknowledged
 each other's right to organize. Labor agreements and
 
 
 961
 DENMARK
 legislation protect the rights of workers and employers and
 regulate the work environment.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Under the Constitution, the Evangelical Lutheran Church is
 recognized as the established church of Denmark. However,
 religious freedom is guaranteed to all residents of Denmark.
 No one may be discriminated against because of religious
 beliefs. These laws are strictly enforced in practice.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Danes have complete freedom to travel and to reenter Denmark.
 Refugees and asylum seekers are provided with travel
 documents, when needed, which permit return to Denmark.
 Forced repatriation is not utilized. The new Alien Act of
 1983 spells out in detail the rights of aliens in Denmark and
 provides for appeal procedures when residence permission is
 denied. An alien directorate was established January 1, 1984,
 which took over work previously handled by the alien police.
 Measures designed to protect the rights of potential refugees
 or asylum seekers include the establishment of a refugee board
 with authority to reverse decisions of the alien directorate
 and guaranteeed access to legal counsel and interpreter
 service.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Denmark is governed by a Cabinet responsible to the Folketing
 (Parliament). The Prime Minister is appointed by the Queen
 after consultation with the political parties represented in
 the Folketing. The present Government, formed in September
 1982, is composed of minority parties under the leadership of
 the Conservatives. Members of the Folketing are selected in
 open elections in which every Danish citizen 18 years or over
 may participate. A political party must obtain at least 2
 percent of the total vote to obtain representation in the
 Folketing. Nine political parties with a variety of political
 beliefs are represented in the current Parliament. The
 Constitution states that parliamentary elections must be held
 at least every 4 years.
 The Government can be changed by calling new elections or, as
 happened in 1982, by the resignation of the Government in
 power and the formation of a new Government composed of
 parties already represented in the Folketing.
 Women actively participate at all levels of the political
 process. They hold positions of authority in political
 parties, local governments, and in the national Government.
 Women head five cabinet ministries (Labor, Interior, Culture,
 Social Affairs, and Ecclesiastical Affairs) and hold about 26
 percent of the seats in the Danish Parliament.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 All Danish citizens and subjects are guaranteed equal
 protection under the law. The territories of Greenland and
 
 
 962
 DENMARK
 the Faroe Islands have home rule governments with broad powers
 encompassing all but foreign and security affairs. Eskimos
 freely participate in international ethnic organizations such
 as the Inuit Circumpolar Conference, which was recently
 recognized by the United Nations and is based in Greenland.
 Even though there are periodic disagreements between the home
 rule authorities and the Danish Government, there have been no
 accusations of human rights violations made against the Danish
 Government before any international organization.
 Denmark is a party to the International Covenants on Human
 Rights, the European Convention on Human Rights, and various
 other conventions designed to promote and protect human
 rights. Denmark was a member of the U.N. Human Rights
 Commission in 1980-82. Denmark was elected to the U.N.
 Commission on the Status of Women in 1983. The Government's
 commitment to human rights issues is fully supported by the
 Danish population. Amnesty International does not mention
 Denmark in its 1984 report; Freedom House rates Denmark
 "free.*
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 Denmark's per capita gross national product in 1982 was
 approximately $12,472. Social benefits are available to all
 on an equal basis without regard to race, creed, or political
 belief. Over 50 percent of the national budget is devoted to
 welfare, housing, labor, and education. Austerity measures
 introduced by the present Government have reduced social
 benefits modestly. However, this step has not materially
 altered the extensive welfare protection provided to Danish
 subjects. At birth, Danes can expect to live to 75 years of
 age. The infant mortality rate is 7.9 per 1,000 live births.
 All school-aged children, including the handicapped, have
 access to free public education, and the nation is 99 percent
 literate.
 The Equal Rights Council has worked successfully to eliminate
 laws and regulations which contained sex discrimination
 provisions. Women hold positions of authority at all levels
 of society, and the number in senior positions is increasing.
 However, the number of unemployed young women (25 years of age
 or younger) remains significantly higher than the number of
 unemployed young men of the same age group.
