 ZIMBABWE
 Zimbabwe is a recently independent state with a parliamentary
 system based on the-Westminster model. Its government of
 national unity is dominated by the Zimbabwe African National
 Union (ZANU), led by Prime Minister Robert Mugabe, which,
 in 1980, clearly won in an election recognized as free and fair
 by international observers. Joining Mugabe's party in forming
 the Government are members of the Zimbabwe African People's
 Union (ZAPU), led by Mugabe's rival Joshua Nkomo, and several
 whites, who are independent members of the Parliament.
 Zimbabwe came to independence in 1980 with a heritage of
 white rule, based on institutionalized racial, social, and
 economic discrimination against the majority black population.
 At the same time, independent Zimbabwe also inherited the
 strongest and most complete industrial infrastructure in black
 Africa, mineral resources, and a strong agricultural base, all
 with significant capacity for growth and for amelioration of
 economic imbalances. Until the 1982-83 drought, Zimbabwe not
 only fed its own people, but also exported food to its neighbors.
 Born of a 15-year long civil war, the present Government has
 respected the Constitution in preserving multiracial democracy
 and the rights of property, but has maintained a legal state of
 emergency in order to combat armed elements which have engaged
 in anti-Government violence. These emergency powers override
 constitutional guarantees of several basic human rights, such
 as freedom from arbitrary arrest, and the right to a prompt and
 fair trial. They have also been used to justify the detention
 of several prominent opponents of the Government, including the
 Prime Minister of the predecessor regime, Bishop Muzorewa, and
 to intimidate other political opponents. Government efforts to
 control dissident activity, concentrated in areas where ZAPU is
 strong, have also strained relations between the two black
 coalition partners and elicited international attention due to
 the substantial loss of life and numerous detentions which
 resulted.
 There are three branches of the security apparatus: the Police
 and its Criminal Investigation Department, which are responsible
 for general criminal cases; the Central Intelligence Organiza-
 tion, which is responsible for investigating security matters;
 and the armed forces, which have sometimes been assigned
 responsibility for enforcing internal security. All three
 branches have in some degree violated human rights during the
 year.
 In early 1983 there were many credible reports of killings of
 between 500 and 700 innocent persons in Matabeleland (in
 the southwest of Zimbabwe), some by dissidents and probably
 more by elements of the army sent to root them out. In the
 same operations, the police and other officials were accused of
 unauthorized searches for weapons and other prohibited items,
 and some people have testified that they were tortured during
 interrogation. In several of these cases, including the
 well-publicized one of six white Air Force officers accused of
 complicity in the sabotage of one-third of the Zimbabwean Air
 Force, the courts have ruled that confessions were not freely
 given and were therefore inadmissable; the defendants were
 subsequently acquitted. Nevertheless, in at least three cases,
 including that of the Air Force officers, the defendants were
 
 
 431
 redetained immediately after acquittal in court and held under
 the Emergency Powers Act.   (The Air Force officers, all dual
 British or Irish citizens, were stripped of their Zimbabwean
 citizenship and released on condition that they leave the
 country.) The total number of persons held under
 security-related detention orders is secret, but believed in
 1983 to have included, for various durations, several hundred
 persons.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Unlawful or Arbitrary Deprivation of Life
 Since mid-1982, there have been widespread reports of
 organized killings of civilians in Matabeleland province,
 the southwestern portion of the country and the stronghold of
 Nkomo's party. The initial wave of killing was attributed by
 government officials to *dissidents" motivated by anti-government
 sentiments, as well as common "bandits.' After an upsurge in
 dissident activity in late 1982 and early 1983, including the
 killing of several prominent white farmers, the Government
 decided that the regular police were unable to cope with the
 threat and called in special military units. Credible reports
 immediately surfaced that the soldiers were themselves involved
 in wanton violence, including the killing of innocent villagers.
 Numerous press reports, primarily from outside Zimbabwe, alleged
 that soldiers of the predominantly all-Shona (majority tribe)
 Fifth Brigade were terrorizing Ndebele (minority tribe) villagers
 in the province. The Government reacted defensively to these
 reports, denying that the military was acting improperly, but
 did eventually recall the Fifth Brigade and ordered an inquiry
 into alleged acts of violence. Since then, the level of
 violence has abated substantially, although dissident activity
 and government attempts to suppress it continue to inflict
 casualties on the civilian population.
 The total number of casualties in the Matabeleland violence is
 difficult to assess. Some estimates run as high as several
 thousand, although several respected organizations which
 reported accurately during the pre-independence civil war
 believe the real tally is in the 500-700 range. It is widely
 accepted that the Fifth Brigade was responsible for many of
 those deaths. The Government has appointed a board of inquiry
 to examine reports that soldiers committed atrocities, and
 advertisements have been placed in the newspapers inviting
 persons to come forward and present evidence to the board. The
 board's findings, the Prime Minister has promised, will be made
 public when the investigation is completed.
 b. Disappearance
 During 1983, an undetermined number of people were arrested
 or detained by official security forces without public announce-
 ment. Most of these arrests occurred in Matabeleland where
 government forces were conducting anti-dissident operations.
 There is no confirmation on how many might still be held or may
 have died in custody or been killed by government forces.
 
 
 432
 Another category of disappearances is represented by the
 rural victims of dissident activity. The Government charges
 that dissidents in Matabeleland have been responsible for
 the disappearance of many local inhabitants, but exact names or
 numbers are difficult to ascertain. It is known that dissidents
 were responsible for the 1982 kidnapping of six foreign tourists,
 including two Americans;  the case remains unresolved.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 The trial of six Air Force officers accused of complicity
 in sabotage of one-third of Zimbabwe's Air Force at the
 Thornhill Airbase attracted international attention in 1983.
 As mentioned in last year's report, the officers claimed that
 their confessions had been extracted under torture. At the
 trial, which took place in open court and was attended by large
 crowds including diplomats and journalists, the officers
 described in graphic detail how they had been subjected to
 deprivation, isolation, physical and verbal abuse, and, in
 several instances, torture with electric shocks. The court
 ruled the confessions inadmissable and acquitted all six,
 although they were subsequently redetained and eventually
 expelled from the country.
 There have been other accusations of torture or other cruel
 punishment, ranging from beatings to bad prison conditions.
 A former white member of Parliament, who was acquitted in 1982
 on charges of attempting to overthrow the Government, alleged
 that he was tortured while in police custody. Although secur-.
 ity regulations prevent disclosure of the details, it has been
 widely rumored that he sued for and received substantial
 damages from the Government in 1983. As far as is known, there
 have been no prosecutions of officials in any of these cases.
 On the subject of torture, the former Minister of Home
 Affairs stated in Parliament that the use of "certain quanti-
 ties of what we consider appropriate technology' may be justi-
 fied where it produced confessions or other evidence to confirm
 the culpability of the accused. He cited the discovery in
 September of the bodies of three white farmers kidnapped
 earlier in the year--a discovery that he attributed to informa-
 tion extracted from a person in police custody. There is no
 evidence that torture has been adopted as a routine method
 during interrogations, but there has been enough evidence of
 maltreatment to justify concern that interrogators do resort to
 this technique.
 Reliable observers have reported that prison conditions are
 spartan but not harsh. Diet, clothing, and exercise are
 governed by regulations; deprivation of necessities is not
 used as a disciplinary measure. Living conditions are some-
 times crowded, with as many as 100 prisoners sharing a large
 room. Medical service is available.
 Many prisoners are required to do manual or farm labor at
 prison facilities. Much less is known of conditions and
 treatment in maximum security prisons, where "security risk"
 prisoners are confined and in which abuses are alleged to
 have occurred.
 
 
 433
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Emergency powers have been in effect since 1960, when the
 former Rhodesian Government first declared a state of
 emergency; this has continued under terms provided for in
 Zimbabwe's independence Constitution. The Emergency Powers Act
 empowers the Home Affairs Minister and any police official to
 detain any person in the interests of public order and safety.
 "Undesirable inhabitants" may be deported under orders of the
 Home Affairs Minister.
 The Emergency Powers Act requires that a tribunal appointed
 by the President review all detention orders within 30
 days. If the tribunal finds no merit to the case, the detainee
 is to be released, but the President can'override the tribunal's
 decision. If the tribunal recommends in favor of detention,
 it continues until revoked by the Minister or until the detainee
 is indicted. The tribunal must review all standing detention
 orders every 180 days. The Government has, as a rule, adhered
 to these legal formalities, although delays are fairly common.
 A detained person is entitled to hear the reasons for his
 detention "as soon as reasonably practicable," but in any case
 not later than seven days after arrest. The detainee is also
 entitled "to obtain and instruct without delay a legal
 representative", and is entitled to compensation for
 unlawful arrest and/or detention. There have been cases
 where substantial delays in permitting access to legal counsel
 have occurred despite this provision, including the Air Force
 officers in the Thornhill case.
 Zimbabwean law provides procedures for an appeal of habeas
 corpus which resemble those in the United States. An arrested
 person may demand, in court, that the evidence leading to his
 arrest be presented. In the case of detention orders, however,
 the Writ of Detention issued by the Home Affairs Minister has
 been deemed sufficient to meet the requirements for evidence.
 The Government refuses to divulge the number of persons
 detained under the Emergency Powers Act despite repeated
 requests for this information by members of Parliament and
 others. Several hundred people are believed to have been
 detained at various times, although the number actually in
 custody at any one time is probably smaller. There are
 reports of detention camps in Matabeleland for preliminary
 interrogation of individuals suspected of complicity in
 dissident activity. Most of the detainees have not been
 charged or presented for trial and are not widely known.
 Others, such as Bishop Muzorewa and leaders of Nkomo's
 former guerrilla army, have drawn international attention,
 but remain in detention. Some of these persons have been
 detained for over a year and may not have had the benefit of
 legal advice.
 On at least 10 occasions in 1983, persons were redetained after
 being acquitted in court. The best known examples are the six
 Air Force officers who were acquitted of complicity in a
 sabotage at the Thornhill Airbase and an earlier case in which
 a group of ranking former officers of Joshua Nkomo's guerrilla
 force were found innocent of high treason; all were redetained
 before they left the courthouse. The Air Force officers have

 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Emergency powers have been in effect since 1960, when the
 former Rhodesian Government first declared a state of
 emergency; this has continued under terms provided for in
 Zimbabwe's independence Constitution. The Emergency Powers Act
 empowers the Home Affairs Minister and any police official to
 detain any person in the interests of public order and safety.
 "Undesirable inhabitants" may be deported under orders of the
 Home Affairs Minister.
 The Emergency Powers Act requires that a tribunal appointed
 by the President review all detention orders within 30
 days. If the tribunal finds no merit to the case, the detainee
 is to be released, but the President can override the tribunal's
 decision. If the tribunal recommends in favor of detention,
 it continues until revoked by the Minister or until the detainee
 is indicted. The tribunal must review all standing detention
 orders every 180 days. The Government has, as a rule, adhered
 to these legal formalities, although delays are fairly common.
 A detained person is entitled to hear the reasons for his ,
 detention "as soon as reasonably practicable," but in any case
 not later than seven days after arrest. The detainee is also
 entitled "to obtain and instruct without delay a legal
 representative*, and is entitled to compensation for
 unlawful arrest and/or detention. There have been cases
 where substantial delays in permitting access to legal counsel
 have occurred despite this provision, including the Air Force
 officers in the Thornhill case.
 Zimbabwean law provides procedures for an appeal of habeas
 corpus which resemble those in the United States. An arrested
 person may demand, in court, that the evidence leading to his
 arrest be presented. In the case of detention orders, however,
 the Writ of Detention issued by the Home Affairs Minister has
 been deemed sufficient to meet the requirements for evidence.
 The Government refuses to divulge the number of persons
 detained under the Emergency Powers Act despite repeated
 requests for this information by members of Parliament and
 others. Several hundred people are believed to have been
 detained at various times, although the number actually in
 custody at any one time is probably smaller. There are
 reports of detention camps in Matabeleland for preliminary
 interrogation of individuals suspected of complicity in
 dissident activity. Most of the detainees have not been
 charged or presented for trial and are not widely known.
 Others, such as Bishop Muzorewa and leaders of Nkomo's
 former guerrilla army, .have drawn international attention,
 but remain in detention. Some of these persons have been
 detained for over a year and may not have had the benefit of
 legal advice.
 On at least 10 occasions in 1983, persons were redetained after
 being acquitted in court. The best known examples are the six
 Air Force officers who were acquitted of complicity in a
 sabotage-at the Thornhill Airbase and an earlier case in which
 a group of ranking former officers of Joshua Nkomo's guerrilla
 force were found innocent of high treason; all were redetained
 before they left the courthouse. The Air Force officers have
 
 
 435
 subsequently been released and expelled from Zimbabwe, but the
 former guerrillas remain in detention.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The constitutional guarantees which protect the accused and
 provide for a 'fair hearing within a reasonable time by an
 independent and impartial court" remain in effect and are, in
 the vast majority of cases, respected. Most major cases,
 including those on sensitive security matters, are held in open
 court and covered by the press.
 Despite some intemperate outbursts by officials when the courts
 have ruled in favor of the defendants, the Government has
 generally reaffirmed the importance of an independent judiciary.
 The outcome of the Thornhill case, despite heavy political
 pressure, and the pending promotion of the presiding judge to
 Chief Justice of the Supreme Court supports that interpretation.
 Because of the independence of the courts in Zimbabwe, the
 number of persons, tried for purely political crimes is fairly
 small, perhaps no more than a dozen in 1983. In nearly all
 cases, these persons, although charged and found guilty of
 violent crimes undertaken to advance their political goals,
 were represented by counsel. A much larger number of suspects,
 perhaps as many as several hundred, are believed.to have been
 in detention under the Emergency Powers Act, again presumably
 for political activities or affiliations deemed inimical to the
 Government. It is uncertain whether formal charges will be
 brought against them.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Constitution guarantees citizens from arbitrary search or
 entry. Under the Emergency Powers regulations, however, any
 police officer may without warrant 'stop and search* any person
 or enter any area where he has "reasonable grounds' for believ-
 ing evidence of a crime may exist and seize it.
 There have been allegations of arbitrary intrusion into homes
 and interference with privacy by government authorities. Most
 of the credible reports relate to the conduct of the security
 forces in operations against dissident groups in Matabeleland.
 Persons in predominantly Ndebele areas have allegedly felt
 compelled to join the ruling party to avoid harassment by
 government forces.
 There have been no allegations of electronic surveillance by
 Zimbabwean authorities. On several occasions, however,
 Zimbabwean citizens have claimed that authorities have opened
 or confiscated private mail.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Considerable freedom of speech and of the press exists in
 practice, but during the year, the Government has taken
 a number of steps to restrict both. Opposition viewpoints
 continue to be freely ventilated in Parliament. On occasion,
 
 
 436
 they are aired in the press, although the local media nearly
 always adheres to the Government's line. Two prominent
 exceptions are a Catholic church-sponsored monthly magazine,
 which often includes articles critical of the Government, and a
 private weekly financial newspaper.
 Criticism of the Government is tolerated, but personal attacks
 on the Prime Minister and the President are not. The only
 known censorship of publications or films is the banning of
 certain works ruled to be excessively violent or pornographic.
 The university continues to enjoy substantial academic freedom,
 but there are indications the Government is stepping up its
 role in molding university-level courses to fit its socialist
 philosophy.
 Shortly after independence, the Government bought out a South
 African financial group which had controlling interest in the
 major newspapers in the country and established a Mass Media
 Trust. This Trust has not exercised direct editorial control
 and appears presently to confine itself to managing the
 financial side of the publications. Nonetheless, there has
 been considerable turnover in editorial personnel at the papers
 and those now in charge generally support the Government's
 policies and programs. The radio and television stations are
 government-owned and generally base their coverage on the
 official version of events. There is greater reflection of the
 Government's views on the airwaves than in print.
 The most significant example of the Government's changing
 attitude toward prefs freedom occurred in July, when Zimbabwe
 joined other southern African states in signing a declaration
 that bans entry into those states by journalists based in
 South Africa. Since that time, several foreign correspondents
 based in South Africa have been refused accreditation to enter
 Zimbabwe for reporting purposes, although exceptions have
 been granted. The Government has also from time to time banned
 reporting of security force and terrorist actions in certain
 parts of the country.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Constitution provides the right of assembly or association,
 but there are restrictions in practice. Persons who intend
 to hold public political meetings must apply for and obtain
 permission from police authorities or the Ministry of Home
 Affairs. Officials from all major opposition parties have
 criticized the Government for hampering their plans to hold
 political rallies. According to most observers, the record
 indicates a disproportionately high number of disallowed or
 disrupted meetings among these opposition groups.
 Other associations not of a political nature appear free
 of official restrictions and meet openly when and where
 they choose. During the outbreak of dissident activity in
 Matabeleland and the subsequent military operations, a curfew
 was imposed which restricted both assembly and movement in
 large parts of that province. When the security situation
 improved, the curfew was lifted.
 
 
 437
 The Government-sponsored umbrella labor organization, the
 Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions, seeks to consolidate a
 fragmented labor movement and bring all labor unions onto its
 roster. The effort has met with mixed success, and the Congress
 leaders occasionally chastise recalcitrant unions for their
 reluctance to join. Legislation is being prepared to make
 membership mandatory, but this idea is being resisted. Strikes
 are permitted and there are no restrictions on linkages
 between trade unions or other associations and public or private
 international bodies.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Freedom of religion is fully respected in Zimbabwe. There is
 no state religion, nor is any one sect or belief favored by
 government policies. All religious denominations are permitted
 to practice openly and to teach their beliefs. There are no
 restrictions on conversion among religions, and there have been
 no reports of any discrimination, harassment, or persecution of
 persons within Zimbabwe for their religious beliefs. There
 has, however, been public discussion of compelling certain
 sects to accept vaccination against disease, some sect members
 having died in a measles epidemic after refusing medicines and
 vaccinations. There is no palpable advantage or disadvantage
 resulting from adherence to any particular religious faith.
 d. Freedom of Movement within the Country, Foreign Travel,
 Emigration, and Repatriation
 Aside from roadblocks or curfews imposed in limited areas when
 dealing with specific security problems, movement within the
 country is unrestricted, and there are no limitations on where
 one may live or work. The Government has, however, expelled
 squatters in urban areas whose camps violate minimum health or
 housing standards. The primary restriction on travel outside
 the country is financial, as the Government limits the amount
 of foreign exchange that Zimbabwean tourists may spend overseas
 each year. Likewise, there is no barrier to emigration except
 for the severe restrictions on the amount of cash or valuables,
 beyond household effects, which may be taken when leaving the
 country permanently.
 There have been cases of persons who have been denied the right
 to return, notably the three Air Force officers who were
 expelled after being released from detention and stripped of
 their Zimbabwe citizenship. On the other hand, Zimbabwe
 continues to welcome the return of citizens who had been
 living, studying, or working outside its borders. These
 returnees have been integrated back into society as fast as
 their skills and the community's resources permit.
 A substantial number of displaced persons from Mozambique have
 settled in the eastern part of Zimbabwe. The Government has
 attempted to tend to their basic needs. Since many of these
 people have family ties in Zimbabwe, it is not clear whether
 they will ever return to Mozambique.
 
 
 438
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to
 Change Their Government
 Zimbabwe is governed by the primarily-Shona Zimbabwe African
 National Union (ZANU) party led by Prime Minister Robert
 Mugabe, which won 57 of the 100 seats in the House of Assembly
 in the 1980 general election. The mainly-Ndebele Zimbabwe
 African People's Union (ZAPU) of Joshua Nkomo won 20 seats;
 Bishop Abel Muzorewa's United African National Congress won
 three; and 20 seats were reserved under the Constitution for
 representatives elected by the white voters. Notwithstanding
 his overall majority in Parliament, Mugabe invited Nkomo and
 members of his ZAPU party to join him in the Government;
 talks on unifying the two parties continue and ZAPU members
 remain in the Cabinet, despite the expulsion of Nkomo and some
 of his senior aides and other political tensions. In addition,
 there are two Ministers and one Deputy Minister drawn from the
 white community.
 Prime Minister Mugabe has often stated his desire and intention
 to establish a one-party state in Zimbabwe, but he has been
 careful to couple that with an affirmation that any such change
 will be achieved by constitutional means. Since the provision
 of 20 seats for white-roll voters is established in the
 Constitution and cannot be changed for the first seven years
 after independence without a unanimous vote in Parliament, it
 appears unlikely that an attempt will be made to move to a
 one-party state before the next elections.
 There has been only one general election in Zimbabwe's three
 years of independence, and, with the next not scheduled
 until late 1984 or early 1985, it is too early to say whether
 the record of free and open elections will continue.  (However,
 by-elections for vacated Parlimentary seats have been held.)
 In the interim, the parties outside government have not hesitated
 to voice their opinions in Parliament on issues both large and
 small, and there has occasionally been dissent within the
 majority's ranks as well. For example, a government-sponsored
 move to deprive Nkomo of his seat in Parliament on grounds of
 prolonged absence failed through lack of a quorum, indicating
 that some government members opposed the move.
 Section 4   Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-Governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government of Zimbabwe is sensitive to criticism of its
 human rights practices. When the Zimbabwean Catholic Bishops
 Commission published a pastoral statement at Easter 1983
 criticizing the military for excessive violence during its
 operations in Matabeleland, Prime Minister Mugabe publicly
 rejected the Bishops' criticisms, but then pledged to look into
 reports of atrocities by the soldiers. Likewise, Mugabe and
 other senior government officials reacted vehemently to foreign
 expressions of concern over the redetention of the six Air
 Force officers.
 within Zimbabwe, the most notable organization monitoring the
 human rights environment is the Catholic Commission for Justice
 
 
 439
 and Peace which has been in existence for nearly 20 years.
 The Commission has been careful over the years to speak out
 about all violations, whether they concern whites or blacks,
 pro- or anti-Government persons. It draws its information
 primarily from the network of Catholic clergy and laymen
 throughout the country, but it also receives information from
 persons outside the.Church. The Commission works carefully
 within the law and, despite its criticisms, has maintained good
 relations with the Government.
 There is no record that major international or non-governmental
 organizations have attempted to investigate human rights viola-
 tions in Zimbabwe, nor of any case in which the Government has
 refused permission for such an investigation. Va-ious indivi-
 duals and groups have, however, attempted to intercede in
 specific cases.
 Except for its long-stqnding and strong opposition to apartheid
 in South Africa, Zimbabwe has not been conspicuously active
 in defense of international human rights. In its 1983 report,
 Amnesty International was concerned about the use of detention
 without trial under emergency legislation and about allegations
 of torture and ill-treatment of detainees and reports of deaths
 in detention. Freedom House describes Zimbabwe as "partly
 free."
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 The Government of Zimbabwe tried to correct the substantial
 imbalance between blacks and whites which existed before
 independence by providing greater opportunities and services to
 the black population of the country. Economic and financial
 constraints have obliged the Government to move slowly in
 implementing many programs, but universal primary education and
 health care for all Zimbabweans and an eventual reduction in the
 large income disparities within the country remain the state's
 goals.
 Provision of health care for Zimbabwe's 8,376,000 people--
 growing at a rate of 3.3 percent a year--varies widely from the
 urban to the rural areas. While there has been some emigration
 of skilled medical personnel since independence, hospitals, and
 clinics in the urban centers still provide good service.
 The rural population, on the other hand, is much less likely
 to have easy access to even basic medical attention, primarily
 because Zimbabwe lacks the personnel and infrastructure necessary
 in a country nearly as large as California. The Government
 is building rural clinics, but it does not have the resources to
 meet all needs immediately. Average life expectancy at birth
 (1980) is 54.41 years and the infant mortality rate (1983) is
 87.3 per 1,000 live births.
 Zimbabwe has traditionally been one of the few countries
 in Sub-Saharan Africa able to feed itself. Indeed, until the
 major two-year drought which began in 1982, it exported maize
 to its less fortunate neighbors. The nutritional balance is
 skewed in favor of the urban dwellers, but until 1982 even the
 rural population had access to an adequate diet. Caloric intake
 
 30-231 0 - 84 - 29
 
 
 440
 as a percentage of requirements in 1977 was 108.52 percent.
 The second year of the drought resulted in food shortages which
 afflict the rural areas. To counter this problem, the Government
 has instituted a large drought relief program. There have been
 instances, however, where delivery of supplies has been delayed
 or interrupted, and undocumented charges that discrimination
 against Ndebele areas has been a feature of the distribution
 pattern. The Government denies any discrimination.
 The status of women in Zimbabwe society is still ambiguous.
 Acknowledging the female role in the struggle for independence,
 the Government in 1980 passed the Legal Age of Majority Act
 which gave women equal legal rights, including the right to
 arrange their own marriages. On the other hand, the system
 of "lobola," or bride price, is still the norm and the reality
 of equal rights remains elusive. Late in 1983, several thousand
 women, mostly innocent housewives, nurses, or schoolgirls,
 were detained in a wholesale crackdown on suspected prostitutes.
 The Government has acknowledged that mistakes had been made
 through overzealousness, and several women's groups have sought
 to capitalize on the incident to educate the public about the
 shortcomings of women's rights in Zimbabwe.
 The Government currently estimates that there are more than 2.5
 million childreh in school in Zimbabwe, up from about 880,000
 at independence three years ago.   However, the Government has
 not been able to meet the demand for classrooms and teachers.
 In addition, the original intention to make all schooling free
 of charge has had to be abandoned and some schools are
 reinstituting fees. Nonetheless, educational opportunities are
 greatly increased over pre-independence levels. The adult
 literacy rate in 1980 was 70.8 percent.
 Income levels continue to vary widely despite the Government's
 intention to make the economy more egalitarian and to provide
 for greater state participation in the means of production.
 (Gross Domestic Product per capita was $815.30 in 1981.) There
 has been considerable upward mobility by black civil servants,
 technicians, and middle level managers, but the average white
 still earns substantially more than the average black, and many
 rural people remain in the subsistence economy. There is no
 discrimination as such in income distribution, nor does the
 disparity reflect any attempt to limit or infringe the human
 rights of any sector of the population. It is merely one
 legacy of the colonial period in which the country developed
 its modern industrial infrastructure on the basis of cheap
 labor for farms and factories and promoted a condition of
 economic dualism which left a majority of the black population
 at or beyond the margins of progress.
