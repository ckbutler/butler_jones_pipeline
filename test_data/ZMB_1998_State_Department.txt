 ZAMBIA
 Zambia is a republic governed by a president and a unicameral national assembly.
 After two decades of one-party rule, free and fair multiparty elections in November
 1991 resulted in the victory of the Movement for Multi-Party Democracy (MMD) and
 the election of President Frederick J.T. Chiluba, a former trade unionist. In Novem-
 ber 1996 elections, President Chiluba was reelected, and his party won 131 of 150
 seats in the National Assembly. Constitutional amendments enacted in May 1996
 disqualified former president Kenneth Kaunda, the main opposition leader, from
 seeking the presidency. The MMD's use of government resources, including the
 state-owned media, put the fairness of the elections into question, although, despite
 some voting irregularities, there was no evidence of substantial or widespread vote
 rigging or vote counting fraud.
 Several days after a short lived coup attempt on October 28, 1997, the President
 proposed and Parliament approved legislation establishing a 90-day state of emer-
 gency, which -was scheduled to end in January but was extended into March. The
 state of emergency allowed the Government to detain suspects for 28 days without
 charge under a police detention order and for the remainder of the state of emer-
 gency under a presidential detention order. By early in the year, the Government
 had detained a total of 7 civilians and about 90 military personnel, including former
 President Kaunda, in connection with the attempted coup. When the state of emer-
 gency was lifted in March, charges had been filed against those detained as sus-
 pected coup plotters. President Kaunda was released after 6 months of detention,
 when the Government decided not to prosecute his case. By year's end, all civilians
 detained in connection with the attempted coup had been released.
 The Constitution mandates an independent judiciary and the Government gen-
 erally respected this provision in practice; however, the judicial system is hampered
 by lack of resources and inefficiency.
 The police, divided into regular and paramilitary units operating under the Min-
 istry of Home Affairs, have primary responsibility for maintaining law and order.
 There were no indications that police action was as highly politicized as in the pre-
 vious year. The Zambia Intelligence Security Service, under the Office of the Presi-
 dent, is responsible for intelligence and internal security. Police continued to commit
 numerous, and at times serious, human rights abuses.
 The Government continued its free market economic reform program. Difficulties
 in privatizing major pot-ions of the parastatal copper mines contributed to negative
 economic developments, including stagnation, increasing inflation, and suspension of
 balance of payments support by foreign donors. Erratic rainfall, floods, and delayed
 delivery of fertilizer contributed to a below average 1997-98 maize crop, the staple
 food of most citizens. Approximately 70 percent of all citizens live in extreme pov-
 erty.

 The Government took steps to address some human rights problems, but serious
 abuses continued in several areas. The police committed extrajudicial killings, and
 beat and otherwise abused criminal suspects and detainees. Prison conditions are
 harsh and life-threatening. Arbitrary arrests, prolonged detention, and long delays
 in trials remain problems. Police infringed on citizens' privacy rights. The Govern-
 ment established a commission of inquiry to investigate the torture of some of the
 coup detainees and promised further steps to improve police training and account-
 ability. However, a lack of professionalism and discipline in the police force remains
 a serious problem. Unlike the previous year, the Government no longer persisted in
 attempts to limit freedom of the press; however, it continued to control two of the
 country's three daily newspapers, contrary to its 1991 campaign promises to pri-
 vatize government-owned mass media. The Government restricted citizens' right of
 peaceful assembly and association, and in a few instances limited freedom of move-
 ment. Citizen's right to change their government was restricted in the 1996 national
 elections, the last time national elections were held.
 In May 1997, the Government established the autonomous Zambian Human
 Rights Commission (ZHRC). Despite initial doubts about its effectiveness, the Com-
 mission obtained access to the coup detainees and investigated and confirmed alle-
 gations that seven of them had been tortured. The Government has promised to in-
 vestigate these charges after the conclusion of the trial of the coup detainees. The
 Commission also took effective steps to press the Government to release a number
 of prisoners. However, human rights and civic organizations continued to complain
 of government harassment. Women continued to experience discrimination in both
 law and fact. Violence against women and denial of widows' inheritance rights re-
 mained widespread. Discrimination against people with disabilities is a problem.
 Child labor exists in rural subsistence occupations and in some urban occupations.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political
 killings during the year, but police continued to use excessive force that at times
 resulted in extrajudicial kiligs. Press accounts reported that police killed 19 per-
 sons during the year. For example, in February the police shot and killed The
 Mijoni, and Felix and Sydney Chtama in Lusaka's Kabulonga residential area where
 they were found pushing their. broken-down vehicle. The police officers responsible
 were arrested and charged with murder, a trial was still under way at year's end.
 In May seven police officers of Mindolo police station in Kitwe were arrested in
 connection with the death in custody of Steward Mwantnde, who they picked up
 in connection with suspected housebreaking. During interrogation police reportediy
 beat and burned Mwantnde by lighting a fire under his legs. Mwantnde died from
 his injuries. The police officers were arrested and a trial was still underway at
 year's end. Also in May, police shot and killed five persons at Agritch Zambia Lim-
 ited who they suspected of robbery. In fact, four of the five persons killed were driv-
 ers and their assistants who were hired to transport tires. No disciplinary action
 against the police officers responsible was reported.
 In August a 12-year-old girl, Rachel Mbewe, was shot and killed by a police officer
 at her home in Lusakas Bauleni township. The officer reportedly was drunk and
 believed that suspected criminals had entered the house; he shot Mbewe when she
 denied that anyone had entered. No disciplinary action against the police officer re-
 sponsible was reported.
 In November police killed eight persons in the aftermath of the murder of former
 Finance Minister Ronald Penza. Police claimed to have killed Penza's attackers, al-
 though it was unclear whether Penza's attackers were among those killed by the
 police. Two additional suspects were apprehended and awaited trial at year's end.
 No action has been taken against the police officers responsible for the killings.
 In November a secondary school student died from a cerebral hemorrhage while
 in police custody. She had been arrested for allegedly stealing examination papers.
 In 1995 army recruits near Kampala Mposhi went on a rampage in retaliation
 for the death of a comrade at the hands of local villagers. The rampaging army re-
 cruits destroyed an estimated 100 village houses and killed 2 villagers. After 3
 years, no disciplinary action has been reported.
 A large number of prison inmates died due to illness and harsh conditions (see
 Section 1.c.).
 b. Disappearance.-There were no confirmed reports of politically motivated dis-
 appearances caused by government officials. However, after a police officer threat-
 ened a lawyer for the treason detainees (see Section 1.d.) with abductions, her son
 
 
 456
 disappeared under suspicious circumstances and later was found some 190 miles
 away (see Section I.e.).
 Former Rwandan Legal Affairs Minister Agnes Ntangibyalino Rutugwera who dis-
 appeared from the country in 1997, was found in a Rwandan prison. The Govern-
 ment investigated the incident, but was able only to determine that the abductors
 were not government officials using government vehicles as alleged.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Although the Constitution prohibits torture, police regularly used excessive force
 when apprehending, interrogating and detaining criminal suspects or illegal aliens.
 In most such instances, detaining officersbeat suspects and generally were not dis-
 ciplined or arreed d for such acts. In May police in the Woodlands station beat a
 foreign embassy guard and the housekeeper of a foreign diplomat after picking them
 up for questioning in connection with a suspected burglary. Neither individual was
 arrested. The officer responsible for the beatings was suspended for 1 month, de-
 moted, and barred from promotion for 7 years.
 In May Steward Mwantende died from injuries the police inflicted upon him dur-
 ing interrogation (see Section l.a.).
 The ZHRC confirmed that police tortured seven of the persons detained after the
 October 1997 coup attempt. There were reports that state agents tortured two of
 the seven in order to make them falsely mplicate former President Kaunda and
 other politicians in the coup attempt. There Were no reports of any government in-
 vestigation into the torture of the coup detainees. In MVarch the ZHRC urged the
 Government to hold an inquiry into these incidents of torture. Foreign governments,
 nongovernmental organizations (NGO's), and other human rights organizations also
 pressed the Government to investigate these incidents of torture and to bring
 charges against those responsible. Early in the year, one of the alleged torturers
 was promoted.
 In May the Government agreed to initiate ar  independent inquiry into torture
 claims by the treason detainees, and, in Augnst established a commission of inquiry
 comprised of treason trial judge Japhet Banda and Lusaka principal resident mag-
 istrate Getrude Chawatama. Due to Judge Banda's treason trial obligations, the tor-
 ture inquiry cannot begin until the treason trial has concluded. The Government
 further promised to institute measures to monitor continuously and reform police
 operations to ensure that civil liberties are protected. It further directed the police,
 prisons, and immigration departments to intensifr human rights training among
 eir officers. The Government indicated that it would amend the Police Act to pro-
 vide for the establishment of a police complaints authority to which members of the
 public could channel complaints pertaining to police harassment and abuse.
 In September Minister of Home Affairs Peter Machungwa reported to Parliament
 that a police investigation had determined that the police did not use live ammuni-
 tion during the August 1997 incident in which police fired on an opposition party
 vehicle, slightly wounding former President Kaunda and seriously wounding opposi-
 tion leaderDr. Roger Chongwe. In June the ZHRC indicated that, due to a lack of
 funding, it was unable to continue with its own investigtions into the shooting.
 Police corruption also is a problem. Citizens in private debt disputes are often d-
 tased by police in exchange for a portion of the payment owed (see Section 1.d.).
 Police sometimes committed extortion at roadblocks (see Section 2.d.).
 The police undertake investigations of instances of police use. of excessive force
 and have disciplined officers who committed human rights abuses. Middle ranking
 and senior officers are enrolled in human rights training seminars at the police
 academy. A number of police officers are the subject of internal investigations and
 prosecutions. Authorities arrested some police officers on such criminal charges as
 murder, robbery, and possession of illegal narcotics.
 In Auust the Legal Affairs Minister announced that the Government had acceded
 to the United Nations Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman and
 Degrading Treatment or Punishment with one reservation. However, by year's end,
 the Government had not ratified the Convention and still had not disciplined or
 prosecuted any of the individuals allegedly involved in the torture of persons de-
 tained in connection with the 1997-98 state of emergency.
 Prison conditions are harsh and life-threatening. According to official statistics,
 prisons designed to hold 6,000 prisoners held over 12,000. This severe overcrowding,
 combined with poor sanitation, inadequate medical facilities, meager food supplies,
 and lack of potable water resulted in serious outbreaks of dysntry and other dis-
 eases, including tuber losis. In a report submitted to Pariament in 1996, the Com-
 missioner of Prisons said that 975 prisoners had died in prison between January
 1991 and December 1995 due to illness and harsh conditions. The death te of pris-
 on inmates remained about the same during the year.
 
 
 457
 
 During a visit to Mpima prison in Kabwe in May, the ZHRC learned that the pris-
 on has had no water supply for the last 3 years. Also in May, a Ndola magistrate,
 Dorothy Kaira, was informed by remandees that poor conditions at the Ndola re-
 mand prison forced them to plead guilty to offenses to enable them to quickly serve
 their terms and be released.
 The Government generally permits prison visits by both domestic and inter-
 national monitors and by resident diplomats.
 In December 1997, the authorities did not allow Africa Watch to visit the detained
 treason suspects. The Government did permit Human Rights Watch and Amnesty
 International to visit President Kaunda and Princess Nakatindi Wina, but they
 were not permitted to visit most of the coup detainees during the year. The authon-
 ties delayed for some time before permitting the ZHRC to visit the coup detainees.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Arbitrary arrest and detention are still
 problems. Criminal suspects often are arrested on the basis of flimsy evidence or
 an uncorroborated accusation. In criminal cases, the law requires that a detainee
 be charged and brought before a magistrate within 24 hours. Attorneys and family
 members are allowed access to pretrial detainees. In practice the authorities hold
 most detainees for more than 1 month from commission of an offense to first ap-
 pearance before a magistrate. In many cases, an additional period of 6 months
 elapses befre a magistrate commits the defendant to the High Court for trial Fol-
 lowing committal, preparation of the magistrate court record for transmittal to the
 High Court takes months, or in some cases as long as a year. Once a case reaches
 the High Court for trial, court proceedings last an average of 6 months.
 Pretrial detention often is prolonged. Approately 2,000 out of 12,000 prisoners
 are awaiting trial on criminal charges. In some cases defendants have been awaiting
 trial for as long as 4 years. There was some progress in holding trials; in past years,
 some defendants had waited for as long as 10 years for their trials. These long
 delays are a result of inadequate resources, inefficiency, lack of trained ersonnel,
 and broad rules of procedure that give wide latitude to prosecutors and Xefense at-
 torneys to request adjournments. The High Court Commissioner can release detain-
 ees if police fail to bring the case to trial, although that did not occur in any case
 during the year.
 Although there is a functioning bail system, overcrowded prisons reflect in part
 the large number of detainees charged with serious offenses for which bail is not
 granted. These include treason, murder, aggravated robbery, and violations of the
 narcotics laws. Constitutional bail was granted in three cases in December. One was
 a criminal case and the other two involved the remaining civilian coup detainees,
 Dean Mung'omba and Princess Wina. The judges in these cases granted bail because
 the accused had been detained for excessive periods without evidence being pre-
 sented against them. Indigent detainees and dependents rarely have the means to
 post bail. The Government legal aid office is responsible for providing legal aid rep-
 resentation for indigent detainees and defendants in crimina or civi cases. In prac-
 tice few receive assistance. The office had 14 attorneys to cover the entire country
 and a budget of $110,000 during the year.
 Police stations frequently become "debt collection centers," where police officers
 acting upon unofficial complaints, detain debtors, without charge, indefinitely until
 they pay the complainants. In return th      e receive a percentage of the pay-
 ments (see Section 1.c.).
 The authorities held in detention pending deportation approximately 600 illegal
 immigrants, principally from neighboring countries. Because the immigration au-
 thorities lack funds for deportation, illegal immigrants are sometimes kept in prison
 for extended periods.
 The state of emergency imposed in October 1997 allowed the Government to de-
 tain suspects for 28 days without charge using a police detention order and for the
 remainder of the state of emergency under a presidential detention order. By the
 time the state of emergency had been lifted in March,charges had been filed against
 the coup suspects, and their cases went into normal legal proceedings that were still
 ngoing at year's end. A total of 7 civilians and about 90 military personnel were
 etained. By year's end all civilians detained in connection with the attempted coup
 and several of the military personnel had been released. The treason trials of the
 detainees who were not released began 7 months after their arrests.
 On Christmas Day 1997, the Government detained former President Kaunda for
 suspected involvement in the October attempted military coup. (President Kaunda
 had left the country shortly before the coup and had returned on December 21.) He
 was moved from prison to house arrest on December 31. The Government filed for-
 eal charges against him in January, but released him on June 1, when the treason
 trial for other detainees began. The Government has not furnished evidence for
 President Kaunda's detention. His release, under an agreement not to prosecute,
 
 
 458
 stipulated that he cannot challenge the MMD Government over his detention or
 seek redress in court.
 Among the treason trial defendants (see Section I.e.) were Zambia Democratic
 Congress President, Dean Mungomba, and Movement for Multi-Party Democracy
 Chairperson for Women Affairs, Princess Wina. In both cases, evidence linking them
 to the attempted coup was not submitted until December, and once submitted was
 declared inadmissible by the judge for failure to comply with legal norms. Both were
 released on December 21 when the Government decided not to prosecute, although
 the case can be resumed if the Government so chooses. The legal and human rights
 communities criticized the Government for using a mechanism that allows charges
 to be reinstated at the Government's discretion.
 In 1996 the Speaker of the National Assembly ordered the indefinite incarceration
 of the Post newspaper reporters Fred Mmembe, Bright Mwape, and Lucy Sichone
 for contempt of the House. The High Court later quashed the sentences, ruling that
 the Speaker had no authority over private citizens. The Government appealed the
 case, seeking to reinstate the detentions of the three reporters. The case still was
 pending at year's end.
 The Government does not use exile for political purposes. However, it has used
 deportation and the threat of deportation for political purposes against persons
 whose claims to citizenship it had refused to recognize.
 During the year, a number of citizens went into self-imposed political exile in for-
 eign countries including: Liberal Progressive Front President, Dr. Roger Chongwe,
 in Australia; Zambia Democratic Congress General Secretary, Azwell Banda, in
 South Africa; former editor of the defunct newspaper Confidential, Reverend Stew-
 ard Mwila, in South Africa; and former President Kaunda's daughter, Catherine
 Mwanza, in South Africa.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Government generally respected the inde-
 pendence of the judiciary during the year. Several court decisions during the year,
 particularly those related to the treason trial, reaffirmed the independence and
 growing strength of the judiciary. For example, in October the High Court ruled
 against the Government and determined that the treason detainees (see Section
 1.d.) could not be forced to return to prison if a doctor maintained that their health
 warranted hospital care. In December the High Court granted constitutional bail to
 Dean Mung'omba and Nakatindi Wina on the grounds that the Government had de-
 tained them for too long without evidence. However, there have been reported in-
 stances in past years in which Parliament overturned Court rulings. The President
 nominates and the National Assembly confirms the Chief Justice and other mem-
 bers of the Supreme Court. The Judicial System is hampered by lack of resources
 and inefficiency.
 The Supreme Court has appellate jurisdiction for all legal and constitutional dis-
 putes. The High Court, which holds regular sessions in all nine provincial capitals,
 has authority to hear criminal and civil cases and appeals from lower courts. Mag-
 istrate courts have original jurisdiction in some criminal and civil cases, while local,
 or customary, courts handle most civil and petty criminal cases in rural areas.
 Local courts employ the principles of customary law, which vary widely through-
 out the country. Lawyers are barred from participating, and there are few formal
 rules of procedure. Presiding judges, who are usually prominent local citizens, have
 great power to invoke customary law, rendering judgments regarding marriages, di-
 vorces, inheritances, other civil proceedings, and minor criminal matters. Judgments
 often are not in accordance with the Penal Code. For example, they tend to discrimi-
 nate against women in matters of inheritance (see Section 5).
 Trials in magistrate courts are public, and defendants have the opportunity to
 confront their accusers and present witnesses. Many defendants, however, are too
 poor to retain a lawyer, and the poor state of the Government's legal aid department
 means that many citizens entitled to legal aid find that it is unavailable. Congestion
 in the courts and long delays while the accused are in custody can be tantamount
 to denial of fair trials.
 In July Nellie Mutti, an attorney for the treason detainees (see Section 1.d.) was
 threatened with abduction by a police officer if she continued to represent one of
 those accused. Mutti brought a complaint before the Lusaka High Court judge, who
 investigated the threat. Later, Mutti's son disappeared from their home under sus-
 picious circumstances and later was found alive in Ndola, some 190 miles away (see
 Section 1.b.).
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution provides for respect for privacy and the inviolability of the home; how-
 ever, the authorities did not always respect these rights in practice. The law re-
 quires a warrant before police may enter a home, unless a state of emergency is
 
 
 in place. Police routinely ignored this requirement and often arrested alleged crimi-
 nals at their homes without first having obtained an arrest warrant. The Constitu-
 tion grants the Drug Enforcement Commission and the Zambian Intelligence Secu-
 rity Service authority to wiretap telephones for possible cause.
 In 1996 the Inspector General of Police admitted in open court that he had or-
 dered the illegal wiretaps of the telephone at the offices of the Post, an independent
 daily newspaper. The case is still ending in court.
 Roundups of suspected illegal aliens in the home or workplace continued. Accord-
 ing to the Government Commissioner for Refugees, immigration officials are empow-
 ered under the law to conduct these roundups without a warrant.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-While the Constitution provides for freedom of
 expression and of the press, the Penal Code lists various prohibited activities that
 may be interpreted broadly to restrict these freedoms; unlike the previous year, the
 Government no longer persisted in attempts to limit freedom of the press. In re-
 sponse to headlines and stories of alleged corrupt practices on the part of govern-
 ment officials, the Government, accused officials, and other individuals have brought
 numerous libel actions against the Post newspaper. At year's end, over 80 cases filed
 over the course of the last 3 years remained to be adjudicated.
 The law includes provisions for investigative tribunals to call as witnesses jour-
 nalists and media managers who print allegations of parliamentary misconduct.
 Failure to cooperate with a tribunal may result in charges of contempt punishable
 by up to 6 months in jail. This is seen by the media as a clear infringement on press
 freedom and a means for parliamentarians to bypass the clogged court system in
 dealing with libel suits against the media.
 A government appeal of a National Assembly case initiated against three journal-
 ists in 1996 remains pending (see Section l.d.).
 On October 21, a judge dismissed a charge of contempt of court against the local
 newspaper the Post. The charge was brought by Attorney General Bonaventure
 Mutale aftr publication of an editorial in the Post noting that Princess Wina and
 Dean Mung'omba remain in prison, although the State has not presented evidence
 of their involvement in the attempted coup of October 28, 1997.
 In February 1997, the Government published the draft of a media bill that would
 have limited press freedom severely. After considerable criticism and protest the
 Government withdrew the bill. Partly in an effort to forestall any future government
 attempts to regulate the media, the Zambia Independent Media Association (ZIMA)
 formed its own media council to establish ethical standards and handle complaints.
 A number of privately-owned newspapers question government actions and poli-
 cies, and circulate without government interference. For the last 2 years, the lead-
 ing private daily, the Post, has had an Internet home page that has attracted over
 15,000 readers per month. The government-controlled Times of Zambia and Zambia
 Daily Mail also have home pages, established in April 1996. The Government owns
 two of the most widely circulated newspapers, as well as the sole television station,
 the Zambia National Broadcasting Corporation (ZNBC). In addition to the govern-
 ment-controlled radio station, there are two church-related stations and one private
 commercial station.
 The Government exercised considerable influence over the government-owned
 media, which continued to follow the government line on important issues. In De-
 cember 1997, the Government pressured a commercial station to refrain from re-
 broadcasting Voice of America (VOA) and British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC)
 items on the grounds that its commercial license did not include such a provision.
 Multichoice, based in South Africa, provides satellite and analog wireless subscrib-
 ers with television services. These services provide broadcasts of Cable News Net-
 work (CNN), BBC World, and Sky Television News. They also provide three BBC,
 one Radio France International, and VOA radio news broadcasts. Neither of the
 services provides local news coverage. A second wireless service, CASAT, began op-
 erations in December 1997. In August Trinity Broadcasting Network, a foreign-
 based church-related television network, began 24-hour transmission from a rented
 studio at the ZNBC.complex.
 Contrary to its 1991 campaign promises to privatize government-owned mass
 media, the Government has declined to privatize the state-owned and government-
 controlled Times of Zambia, the Zambia Daily Mail, and the ZNBC radio and tele-
 vision stations. Deputy Information Minister, Fidelis Mando, reiterated the Govern-
 mentfs position in April, when he stated that the Government would continue to
 own the mass media.
 In January police injured a CNN reporter when trying to seize her camera while
 she was attempting to speak to former President Kaunda during his habeas corpus
 
 
 application case before the Lusaka High Court. President Kaunda was challenging
 his detention by the MMD Government. The police also prevented some local and
 foreign reporters and camera crews from covering a part of the Kaunda trial or film-
 ing events outside of the courthouse.
 In July the Lusaka High Court nullified the 3-month suspension by the Speaker
 of the National Assembly of the National Party Solwezi Central Member of Par-
 liament, Dr. Ludwig Sondashi, describing it as "a violation of his rights." Sondashi
 was alleged to have remarked that "sometimes coups can be positive," in reference
 to the failed October 28, 1997, attempted military coup.
 Academic freedom is respected. University professors are permitted to lecture
 freely, conduct research, and publish their work.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 freedom of peaceful assembly, but the Government restricted this right in practice.
 The law requires rally organizers to notify the police 7 days in advance of a rally.
 The police may advise the organizers that the time or venue is inopportune. In prac-
 tice the police did not interfere with most peaceful rallies whose leaders followed
 the prior notification rule; however, authorities sometimes denied permission to pro-
 ceed for rallies planned by the political opposition, particularly the United National
 Independence Party (UNIP). An assembly permit also was denied to the Nongovern-
 mental Organization Coordinating Committee for a rally to support the U.N. Day
 for Women s Rights.
 The Government banned political meetings and rallies during the state of emer-
 gency at the beginning of the year, but such activities resumed after the lifting of
 the state of emergency.
 The Constitution provides for freedom of association, however, on occasions the
 Government has harassed and arrested NGO leaders. In 1996 authorities arrested
 NGO leaders, Alfred Zulu and Ngande Mwanajiti, and charged them with receiving
 financing from foreign governments. While the charges have not been dropped, they
 are not being pursued, and both men remain active and free.
 All organizations must apply formally for registration to the registrar of societies.
 In most cases, authorities routinely approved these applications. There are currently
 38 political parties and dozens of NGOs registered.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-A 1996 amendment to the Constitution declared the
 country a Christian nation while providing for freedom of religion. In practice, the
 Government generally respects the right of all faiths to worship freely.
 Some members of'the Muslim community have complained that their religion has
 been discriminated against since the country was declared a Christian nation. They
 contend that they are unable freely to teach and practice Islam. However, other
 Muslim organizations state that they have not experienced any restrictions on their
 actions. There are mosques in the country, and the Government does not appear to
 hinder Muslim worship or teaching.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Constitution provides citizens the right to move freely throughout
 the country, to reside in any part of the country, and to depart and return to the
 country without restriction. The authorities generally respected these rights during
 the year, but police roadblocks to control criminal activity continued, and police
 sometimes extorted money and goods from motorists. In December 1997, several
 days after UNIP President Kaunda's detention, the passports of his son, Major Wezi
 Kaunda, Wezi's wife, and a UNIP central committee member, Stanley Muntanga,
 were confiscated when they tried to cross the border into Zimbabwe. The passports
 were returned early in the year.
 In May the passport of the former editor of the defunct newspaper Confidential,
 Reverend Stewart wila, was confiscated when he was about to board a bus to
 South Africa. Mwila had published a story about a plot to discredit Chief Justice
 Matthew Ngulube during the period prior to the 1996 national elections. Also in
 May, the passport of Dr. Rajan Mathani was confiscated at Ndola airport, where he
 had already boarded an aircraft bound for South Africa. Mathani was subsequently
 detained in connection with the failed coup and later released.
 While there is no law specifically addressing refugee processing issues, the Gov-
 ernment complies with the provisions of the 1951 U.N. Convention Relating to the
 Status of Refugees and its 1967 Protocol. The United Nations High Commissioner
 for Refugees (UNHCR) estimated that there were approximately 120,000 refugees,
 mainly Angolans, in the country. The Government cooperated with the UNHCR in
 processing applications for refugee status. The Government provided first asylum to
 3,552 refugees during the year.
 There was a small influx of persons from the Democratic Republic of Congo follow-
 ing increased fighting in that country in August. In response to the alleged criminal
 activities of many Congolese nationals in the border area, the Government rounded
 
 
 up, arrested, and deported many Congolese and other illegal aliens throughout the
 year. The deportation of illegal aliens is lawful; however, those who had been ac-
 corded refugee status by the UNHCR were sometimes picked up and held for var-
 ious lengths of time before being released.
 There were no cases in which the Government deported refugees who were reg-
 istered with the UNHCR, and there were no reports of the forcible return of persons
 to a country where they feared persecution.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens voted in multiparty elections in November 1996; however, constitutional
 amendments barred the best known opposition candidate, former president and
 UNIP leader, Kenneth Kaunda, and his deputy, senior chief Inyambo Yeta, from
 running for the presidency in 1996, thereby restricting the right of citizens to
 change their government. The amendments enacted in 1996 require both parents of
 presidential candidates to be citizens by birth and disqualify tribal chiefs from run-
 ning for the presidency.
 UNiP boycotted the elections and destroyed many party members' voter registra-
 tion cards. Eleven political parties contested the presidential and National Assembly
 elections in 1996. The Government deregistered 14 opposition splinter parties for
 noncompliance with registration procedures. Approximately 50 percent of eligible
 voters registered. Of this total, almost 70 percent cast ballots. Although the MMD's
 use of government resources, including the state-owned media, during caipaigns
 probably did not affect the final outcome, the elections' fairness was nevertheless
 put into question. The Government's failure to implement a transparent registration
 process raised doubts about the Government's willingness to have an open electoral
 process.
 Local government elections, originally scheduled for 1995, were held on December
 30. While the Government acted within the limits of the law, it gave only 1 month's
 notice of the election date, which prompted opposition parties to complain that they
 had insufficient time to prepare campaigns. The short notice also meant that the
 Electoral Commission was    repared to conduct a large-scale operation. As a re-
 sult, there were several reports of administrative problems at polling stations, in-
 cluding voting registrars being sent to the wrong polling stations, party symbols
 being mixed up on ballots, and polling stations being under-supplied with ballots.
 Voter turner was extremely low. However, despite serious irregularities, the elec-
 tions generally reflected the will of the electorate.
 Under the Constitution, the President wields broad authority. The National As-
 sembly ratifies major appointments and theoretically has broad powers, but the
 overwhelming majority held by the MMD effectively mitigates against independent
 action by the legislature and limits its ability to provide a check on executive au-
 thority.
 The number of women in politics and government is increasing, but remains
 small. There are 15 female Members of Parliament; 2 of these are ministers, and
 3 are deputy ministers. There also are three ethnic Asians in Parliament (one is a
 minister), and one mixed race (African-European) minister.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Human rights and civic rights organizations generally operated without serious
 govterne hindran     e howr, police arrested the leaders of the Zambian Inde-
 pendent Monitoring Team (ZIMT) and the Committee for a Clean Campaign (CCC)
 i November 1996 after the two organizations described the 1996electoral process
 as neither free nor fair. Although these detentions were brief, the ZIMT, the CCC,
 the African Human Rights Network (AFRONET), and the Foundation for Electoral
 Processes have claimed that official harassment, including blocking their bank ac-
 counts, has continued.
 The Government continued to be receptive to criticism from human rights and
 civic organizations in general, but on occasion, government officials accused human
 rights monitors of abetting crime and thwarting the work of the police through their
 focus on victims of police brutality. The Government generally did not interfere with
 inquiries or visits by international human rights organizations. However, in Decem-
 ber 1997, the authorities refused to give permission for a human rights representa-
 tive from Africa Wath to visit detainees in prison, and Human Rights Wath and
 Amnesty International were not permitted to visit most of the coup detainees during
 the year.
 Other human rights organizations, including the Law Association of Zambia,
 Women for Change, the Catholic Commission for Justice and Peace, and the Zambia
 
 
 462
 Civic Education Association have continued to press for a transparent democratic
 electoral system.
 In May the Government accused local human rights groups and NGO's of advocat-
 ing poverty for the country by lobbying the international community to continue
 withholding balance of payments support to the country because of its allegedly poor
 human rights record.
 In May 1997, the Government established an autonomous Human Rights Com-
 mission. A Supreme Court justice chairs the Commission; other members are drawn
 from throughout society and include the former head of the Foundation for Demo-
 cratic Processes and a University of Zambia lecturer on human rights. The Commis-
 sion interceded on behalf of persons who it concluded had their rights denied by the
 Government. In-order to monitor actively human rights abuses at the local level,
 the Commission established human rights committees in all provincial capitals.
 While there were doubts at first about its autonomy and effectiveness, the Commis-
 sion aggressively sought and received access to the coup detainees, exposed the tor-
 ture of seven of them, and demanded and obtained better medical care for them.
 The Commission spoke out on behalf of other detainees and prisoners, and the Gov-
 ernment responded by releasing seriously ill prisoners at the Commission's request.
 The Government has responded further to the Commission's recommendation by es-
 tablishing an inquiry to investigate torture claims by detainees. The inquiry is
 chaired by a High Court justice, and a principal resident magistrate is a member.
 The Government continued to cooperate with the International Criminal Tribunal
 for Rwanda (ICTR) in detaining and sending to Arusha those persons whom the
 ICTR identified as suspected war criminals.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution prohibits discrimination based on race, tribe, sex, place of origin,
 marital status, political opinion, color, or creed. Constitutional amendments barring
 native born Zambians of partial or full foreign ancestry from the presidency appear
 to violate the prohibition on discrimination based on place of origin. These amend-
 ments also prohibit traditional chiefs, who are accorded authority and privileges as
 chiefs, from running for political office unless they resign their chieftainships. A
 legal challenge to these amendments in 1996 was unsuccessful.
 Women.-Violence against women remained a serious problem. Wife beating and
 rape were widespread. According to official statistics, over 4,700 rape cases were re-
 ported to the police between 1991 and 1998. Of these, approximately 30 percent re-
 sulted in conviction and 5 percent in acquittal. The remainders either were dis-
 missed or remain unresolved. Defendants convicted of rape normally were sentenced
 to hard labor. Since many rape cases were not reported to police, the actual number
 is considered much higher. Domestic assault is a criminal offense. Although the po-
 lice established a Victim Support Unit (VSU) to attend to issues of domestic assault
 in 1997, in practice police often are reluctant to pursue reports of wife beating, pre-
 ferring instead to broker a reconciliation. The Government and NGO's expressed
 continued concerii about violence against women, and the media devoted consider-
 able publicity to it during the year. The VSU handles problems of wife beating, mis-
 treatment of widows by the deceased husband's relatives, and "property grabbing."
 Both the Constitution and the law entitle women to equality with men in most
 areas. In practice, women are disadvantaged severely in formal employment and
 education compared with men. Married women who are employed often suffer from
 discriminatory conditions of service. Women have little independent access to credit
 facilities; in most cases, they remain dependent on their husbands, who are required
 to co-sign for loans. As a result, few women own their own homes. However, some
 small financial institutions reportedly are now allowing women to sign independ-
 ently for loans.
 Customary law and practice also place women in a subordinate status with re-
 spect to property, inheritance, and marriage, despite various constitutional and leg-
 islative provisions. Polygyny is permitted if the first wife agrees to it at the time
 of her wedding. Under the traditional customs prevalent in most ethnic groups, all
 rights to inherit property rest with the deceased man's family. The 1989 Intestate
 Succession Act was designed to provide women with a share of the joint estate.
 Under the act, the chilren of the deceased man equally share 50 percent; the
 widow receives 20 percent; the parents receive 20 percent; and other relatives re-
 ceive 10 percent. A 1996 "reform' of the act places the widow's share at 20 percent,
 to be divided equally with any other women who can prove a marital relationship
 with the deceased man, thus granting inheritance rights to other wives, mistresses,
 and concubines.
 
 
 In practice, "property grabbing" by the relatives of the deceased man continues
 to be rampant, particularly when local customary courts have jurisdiction. These
 courts often use a different law, the Local Courts Act, to distribute inheritances
 without reference to the percentages mandated by the Intestate Succession Act. As
 a result, many widows receive little or nothing from the estate. The fines that the
 Intestate Succession Act mandates for property grabbing are extraordinarily low.
 Children.-The Government seeks to improve the welfare of children, but scarce
 resources and ineffective implementation of social programs continue to affect ad-
 versely the welfare of children. Education is neither compulsory nor free. Due to
 poverty, both rural and urban children often work in the informal sector to help
 families make ends meet (see Section 6.d.). The number of street children in Lusaka
 has jumped from 35,000 in 1991 to 90,000 during the year, partially because of the
 number of parents who have died from AIDS. Approximately 75 percent of all
 households are caring for at least one orphan and, as a result, these children face
 greater risks of child abuse, sexual abuse, and child labor.
 People With Disabilities.-Persons with disabilities face significant societal dis-
 crimination in employment and education. The Government has taken steps to ame-
 liorate their hardships, including establishing a national trust fund to provide loans
 to the disabled to help them start businesses, but its efforts are limited by scarce
 resources. The Government has not legislated or otherwise mandated accessibility
 to public buildings and services for the disabled.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution provides for the right of citizens
 to form trade unions, and approximately 60 percent of the 300,000 formal sector
 workers are unionized. Seventeen of the country's 19 large national unions, orga-
 nized by industry or profession, are affiliated with the Zambia Congress of Trade
 Unions (ZCTU). The ZCTU is operated democratically and, like its constituent
 unions, is independent of any political party and the Government. The Mine Work-
 ers Union of Zambia and four other unions broke away from the ZCTU and estab-
 lished a rival umbrella organization in 1994. Three of them have since rejoined the
 ZCTU.
 The 1993 Industrial and Labor Relations Act (ILRA) reestablished the "one union,
 one industry" principle. The Bankers Union of Zambia, though registered with the
 Government in 1993, has been unable to operate because the employers recognize
 the existing Zambia Union of Financial and Allied Workers. In 1993 the Ndola High
 Court ordered the Government to register the Secondary School Teachers Union of
 Zambia. The Government continues to argue that the Zambia National Teachers
 Union represents secondary school teachers and has delayed administratively rec-
 ognition of the new secondary school teachers union.
 All workers have the right to strike, except those engaged in essential services.
 In addition to the Zambia Defense Force, the Judiciary, the police, the prison serv-
 ice, and the Intelligence Security Service, the ILRA defines as essential services
 power, medical, water, sewerage, fire fighting, and certain mining occupations es-
 sential to safety. It permits strikes only after all other legal recourse has been ex-
 hausted. Thus, in practice, all work stoppages during the year were illegal. The
 ILRA prohibits employers from retribution against employees engaged in legal
 union activities. Workers engaged in illegal strikes do not enjoy this protection.
 By a majority vote of its members, a union may decide on affiliation with the
 ZCTU or with trade unions or organizations outside the country. The ZCTU is a
 member of the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions. Labor leaders
 travel without restrictions to international conferences and to visit counterparts
 abroad.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Employers and unions in
 each industry negotiate collective bargaining agreements through joint councils in
 which there is no government involvement. Civil servants and teachers, as public
 officials, negotiate directly with the Government. Collective disputes are referred
 first to conciliation. If conciliation fails to resolve the dispute, the parties may refer
 the case to the Industrial Relations Court, or, in the case of employees, vote to
 strike. In practice, the industry joint councils function effectively as collective bar-
 gaining units.
 TheILRA prohibits discrimination by employers against union members and orga-
 nizers. An employee who believes that he has been penalized for union activities
 may, after exhausting any existing administrative channels for relief, fie a com-
 plaint with the Industrial Relations Court. This court has the power to order appro-
 priate redress for the aggrieved worker. The complainant may appeal a judgment
 of the Industrial Relations Court to the Supreme Court. In practice, the Court often
 orders employers to reinstate workers found to have been victims of discrimination.
 
 
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Constitution prohibits slavery
 and involuntary servitude but it authorizes the Government to call upon citizens to
 perform labor in specific instances,- for example, during national emergencies or dis-
 asters. Moreover, the Government can require citizens to perform labor that is asso-
 ciated with traditional civil or communal obligations, as when all members of a vil-
 lage are called upon to assist in preparing for a visit by a traditional leader or other
 dignitary. In practice, bonded labor by adults or children is not permitted, and the
 labor authorities enforce the legal proscriptions when cases violating the law are
 brought to their attention (see Section 6.d.).
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment.-The legal
 minimum age for employment of children is 16 years. The Labor Commissioner ef-
 fectively enforces this law in the industrial relations sector although, because of
 high adult unemployment, there is no demand for child labor. The law is not en-
 forced for those who work in subsistence agriculture, domestic service, and informal
 sectors, where children under the age of 16 often are employed. In urban areas, chil-
 dren commonly engage in street vending. Forced or bonded labor by children is not
 permitted, and the authorities enforce legal proscriptions when cases of violations
 are brought to their attention (see Section 6.c.).
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The minimum wage for nonunionized workers
 is set at $0.05 (70.30 kwacha) per hour. Based on a 48-hour workweek, the legal
 maximum for nonunionized workers, a worker earning the minimum wage would re-
 ceive $35 (90,000 kwacha) per month. The minimum wage covers nonunionized
 workers in categories such as general workers, cleaners, office orderlies, and watch-
 men. The minimum wage is insufficient to provide a worker and family with a de-
 cent standard of living, and most minimum wage earners supplement their incomes
 through second jobs, subsistence farming, or reliance on the extended family.
 With respect to unionized workers, wage scales and maximum workweek limits
 are established through collective bargaining. In practice, almost all unionized work-
 ers receive salaries considerably higher than the nonunionized minimum wage. The
 minimum workweek for full-time employment is 40 hours and is, in practice, the
 normal workweek. The law requires 2 days of annual leave per month of service.
 The law also regulates minimum health standards in industry, and the Depart-
 ment of Mines is responsible for enforcement. Factory safety is handled by the In-
 spector of Factories under the Minister of Labor, but staffing problems chronically
 limit enforcement effectiveness. There are no legislative provisions to protect a
 worker who refuses to work on grounds of inadequate safety.
