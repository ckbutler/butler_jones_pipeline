 BAHRAIN
 Bahrain is a hereditary emirate with few democratic institutions and no political
 parties. The A-Khalifa extended family has ruled Bahrain since the late 18th cen-
 tury and dominates its society and government. The Constitution confirms the Amir
 as hereditary ruler. The current Amir, Shaikh Isa Bin Sulman Al Khalifa, governs
 Bahrain with the assistance of a younger brother as Prime Minister, the Amir's son
 as Crown Prince, and an appointed cabinet of ministers. In 1975 the Government
 suspended some provisions of the 1973 Constitution, including those articles relat-
 ing to the National Assembly, which was disbanded and never reconstituted. Citi-
 zens belong to the Shi'a and Sunni sects of Islam, with the Shi'a comprising over
 two thirds of the indigenous population. The Sunnis predominate because the ruling
 family is Sunni and is supported by the armed forces, the security service, and pow-
 erful Sunni and Shi'a merchant families. Bahrain experienced continued political
 unrest during the year, including bomb and arson attacks on public and private
 property. There are few judicial checks on the actions of the Amir and his govern-
 ment, and the courts are subject to government pressure.
 The Ministry of Interior is responsible for public security. It controls the public
 security force (police) and the extensive security service, which are responsible for
 maintaining internal order. The Bahrain Defense Force (BDF) is responsible for de-
 fending against external threats. It did not play a role in internal security during
 the year. Security forces committed serious human rights abuses.
 Bahrain has a mixed economy, with government domination of many basic indus-
 tries, including the important oil and aluminum industries. Possessing limited oil
 and gas reserves, Bahrain is intensifying efforts to diversify its economic base com-
 panies doing business in banking, financial services, oil field services, and light
 manufacturing. The Government has used its modest oil revenues to build an ad-
 vanced transportation and telecommunications infrastructure. Bahrain has become
 a regional financial and business center. Tourism, particularly via the causeway
 linking Bahrain to Saudi Arabia, is also a significant source of income.
 The country's human rights situation improved slightly during the year due to a
 decrease in the level of political unrest; however, there was no change in the Gov-
 ernment's human rights practices and numerous serious problems remain. The main
 problems continue to include the denial of the right of citizens to change their gov-
 ernment; political and other extrajudicial killings; torture; arbitrary arrest; incom-
 municado and prolonged detention; involuntary exile; limitations on or the denial
 of the right to a fair public trial, especially in the security court; infringements on
 citizens' right to privacy; and restrictions on freedom of speech, press, assembly, as-
 sociation, and worker rights. The Government imposes some limits on freedom of
 religion and movement. Domestic violence against women and discrimination based
 on sex, religion, and ethnicity remain problems.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-On June 8, 25-year-old Abdul Zahra
 Ibrahim Abdullah, from the village of Sanabis, reportedly died from mistreatment
 he received during 2 days of detention. Although authorities cited ill health as the
 cause of death, there was no public inquiry into the allegations that he died from
 torture.
 There were no investigations or prosecutions of any security forces personnel for
 alleged extrajudicial killings committed in earlier years.
 Two Asian laborers died on July 5 when antigovernment protesters set fire to a
 store in the village of Sitra. On June 13, four Asian laborers died when a fire de-
 stroyed the business establishment directly below their residence. Credible sources
 consider it likely that antigovernment arsonists were responsible for the attack.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Torture and other cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment are pro-
 hibited by law; however, there are credible reports that prisoners often are beaten,
 both on the soles of their feet and about the face and head, burned with cigarettes,
 forced to endure long periods without sleep, and in some cases subjected to electrical
 shocks. The Government has difficulty in rebutting allegations of torture and of
 other cruel, inhuman, or degrading practices because it permits incommunicado de-
 tention and detention without trial. There were no known instances of authorities
 being punished for human rights abuses committed either during the year or in any
 previous year.
 
 
 1416
 Opposition and human rights groups allege that the security forces sometimes
 threaten female detainees with rape and inflict other forms of sexual abuse and har-
 assment on them while they are in custody. These allegations are difficult either
 to confirm or deny.
 . On several occasions, security forces used force, including tear gas, to disperse
 public gatherings (see Section 2.b.).
 At the Government's invitation, the ICRC continued the series of visits to prisons
 that it started in late 1996. The ICRC, by choice of working methods, traditionally
 does not make any of its findings public. Prisons are overcrowded, however the pris-
 on situation has significantly improved with the visits of the International Commit-
 tees of the Red Cross (ICRC.) Local defense attorneys report that their clients are
 receiving improved care and treatment. In addition, the release of prisoners and the
 reduced number of arrest has helped to ease overcrowding.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Arbitrary arrest and detention are prob-
 lems. The Constitution states that "no person shall be arrested, detained, impris-
 oned, searched or compelled to reside in a specified place. . . except in accordance
 with the provisions of the law and under the supervision of the judicial authorities."
 In practice, however, in matters regarding arrest, detention, or exile, the 1974 State
 Security Act takes precedence. Under the State Security Act, persons may be de-
 tained for up to 3 years without trial for engaging in activities or making state-
 ments regarded as a threat to the broadly defined concepts of national harmony and
 security and the Government continued arbitrarily to arrest and detain citizens. The
 scope of the State Security Act extends to any case involving arson, explosions, or
 attacks on persons at their place of employment or because of the nature of their
 work. Detainees have the right to appeal such detentions after a period of 3 months
 and, if the appeal is denied, every 6 months thereafter from the date of the original
 detention.
 Government security forces used the State Security Act regularly during the year
 to detain persons believed by the Government to be engaging in antigovernment ac-
 tivities, as well as those attempting to exercise their rights of free speech, associa-
 tion, or other rights deemed to be in opposition to the Government. Activities that
 also can lead to detention, questioning, warning, or arrest by the security forces in-
 clude: membership in illegal organizations or those deemed subversive; painting
 antigovernment slogans on walls; joining antigovernment demonstrations (see Sec-
 tion 2.b.); possessing or circulating antigovernment writings; preaching sermons con-
 sidered by the Government to have an antigovernment political tone; and harboring
 or associating with persons committing such acts.
 In addition to overseeing the security service and police the Ministry of Interior
 also controls the Office of the Public Prosecutor, whose olficers initially determine
 whether sufficient evidence exists to continue to hold a prisoner in investigative de-
 tention. The Ministry is responsible for all aspects of prison administration. In the
 early stages of detention, prisoners and their attorneys have no recourse to any au-
 thority outside the Ministry of Interior. The authorities rarely permit visits to in-
 mates who are incarcerated for security-related offenses and such prisoners may be
 held incommunicado for months, sometimes years. Prisoners detained for criminal
 offenses, however, generally may receive visits from family members, usually once
 a month.
 Security forces are estimated to have held over 1,300 people in detention for secu-
 rity-related offenses during the year, including some who were arrested, released,
 and then arrested again. At year's end, as many as 1,100 persons still remained in
 detention. The Government pardoned as many as 200 persons detained in connec-
 tion with antigovernment activities.
 Abdul Amir AI-Jamri, a prominent Shi'a cleric, longtime opposition activist, and
 one of the original 14 signers of the 1994 petition to the Amir calling for the restora-
 tion of the National Assembly, was arrested in January 1996 and remained in cus-
 tody throughout 1997. Although he is reportedly accused by the Government of com-
 mitting a wide variety of security-related crimes, including treason, Al-Jamri has
 not been brought to trial or publicly charged with any crime. Several other Shi'a
 clerics associated with A1-Jamri, Abdul Wahab Hussein, Hassan Mushaimaa, Has-
 san Sultan, Ali Bin Ahmed Al-Jedhafsi, Haji Hassan Jarallah, and Ali Mirza Al-
 Nachas also were arrested at the same time as Al-Jamri and remain in jail. On
 June 29, the Government announced that AI-Nachas died in detention of natural
 causes.
 While the authorities reserve the right to use exile and the revocation of citizen-
 ship to punish individuals suspected, or convicted, of antigovernment activity, there
 were no reports of exile orders issued during the year. In the past, the Government
 has revoked the citizenship of persons it considered security threats. The Govern-
 ment considers such persons to have forfeited their nationality under the Citizen-
 
 
 1417
 ship Act of 1963 because they accepted foreign citizenship or passports, or engaged
 in antigovernment activities abroad. Bahraini emigre groups and their local contacts
 have challenged this practice, arguing that the Government's revocation of citizen-
 ship without due process violates the Constitution. According to the emigre groups,
 as many as 500 citizens continue to live in exile. This total includes both those pro-
 hibited from returning to Bahrain and their family members who voluntarily live
 abroad with them.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution provides for an independent judi-
 ciary; however, the courts are subject to government pressure regarding sentencing
 and appeals.
 The civil and criminal legal system consists of a complex mix of courts, based on
 diverse legal sources including Sunni and Shi'a Shari'a (Islamic law), tribal law, and
 other civil codes and regulations. The 1974 State Security Act created a separate,
 closed  security  court system   which  has jurisdiction  in  cases of alleged
 antigovernment activity.
 The Bahrain Defense Force maintains a separate court system for military per-
 sonnel accused of offenses under the Military Code of Justice. Military courts do not
 review cases involving civilian criminal or security offenses.
 Defense attorneys are appointed by the Ministry of Justice and Islamic Affairs.
 Some attorneys and family members involved in politically sensitive criminal cases
 complain that the Government interferes with court proceedings to influence the
 outcome or to prevent judgments from being carried out. There are periodic allega-
 tions of corruption in the judicial system.
 In past cases, the Amir, the Prime Minister, and other senior government officials
 all have lost civil cases brought against them by private citizens. The court-ordered
 judgments, however, are not always implemented expeditiously. Members of the rul-
 ing Al Khalifa family are well represented in the judiciary and do not generally ex-
 cuse themselves from cases involving the interests of the Government.
 A person arrested may be tried in an ordinary criminal court or, if recommended
 by the prosecution, in the Security Court. Ordinary civil or criminal trial procedures
 provide for an open trial, the right to counsel (with legal ad available when nec-
 essary), and the right to appeal. Criminal court proceedings generally do not appear
 to discriminate against women, children, or minority groups.However, there is cred-
 ible evidence that persons accused of antigovernment crimes and tried in the crimi-
 nal courts were denied fair trials. The accused are not permitted to speak with an
 attorney until their appearance before the judge at the preliminary hearing. Trials
 in the criminal courts or antigovernment activities were held in secret.
 _Security cases are tried in secret by the Supreme Court of Appeals, sitting as the
 Security Court. Family members are usually not permitted in the court until the
 final verdict is rendered. Procedures in the security courts do not provide for even
 the most basic safears. The Security Court is exempt from adhering to the proce-
 dural protections of the Penal Code. Defendants may be represented by counsel but
 seldom see their attorneys before the actual day of arraignment. Convictions may
 be based solely on confessions and police evidence or testimony that may be intro-
 duced in secret. The defense cannot review the evidence against the defendant prior
 to trial proceedings. Defense lawyers complain th  hey rarely are given suffiient
 time to develop witnesses. There is no rig t to judicial review of the legality of ar-
 rests. There is no judicial appeal of a   Security Court verdict, but the defend-
 ant may request clemency from the Amir. In March the Security Court tried 59 indi-
 viduals on charges of being members of a terrorist organization aimed at overthrow-
 ing the Government. The Security Court ultimately convicted 33 individuals and ac-
 quitted 24.
 The number of political prisoners is difficult to determine because the Govern-
 ment does not release data on security cases, such cases are not tried in open court,
 and visits to prisoners convicted of security offenses are strictly restricted. The Gov-
 ernment denies that there are any political prisoners, and claims that all inmates
 incarcerated for committing security offenses were convicted properly of subversive
 acts such as espionage, espousing or committing violence, or belonging to terrorist
 organizations.
 In accordance with tradition, the Government releases and grants amnesty to
 some prisoners, including individuals imprisoned for political activities, on major
 holidays. The Government pardoned over 150 prisoners in April during the Eid A1-
 Adha holiday.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-Under
 the law, the Ministry of Interior is empowered to authorize entry into private prem-
 ises without specific judicial intervention. Domestic and international telephone
 calls and correspondence are subject to monitoring. Police informer networks are ex-
 tensive and sophisticated.
 
 
 1418
 During the year, the Government frequently infringed on citizens' right to privacy,
 using illegal searches and arbitrary arrests as tactics to control political unrest. Se-
 curity forces frequently raided villages at night, entered private homes without war-
 rants, and took into custody residents who were suspected of either participating in
 or having information regarding antigovernment activities. While conducting these
 raids, security forces frequently confiscated, damaged, or destroyed personal prop-
 erty, for which owners were not compensated by the Government. Security forces
 also frequently set up checkpoints at the entrances to villages, requiring vehicle
 searches and proof of identity from anyone seeking to enter or exit. Whenever pos-
 sible, the Government jams either in whole or in part foreign broadcasts that carry
 antigovernment programming or commentary. A government-controlled proxy pro-
 hibits user access to Internet sites considered to be antigovernment or anti-Islamic
 (see Section 2.a.).
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-Although the Constitution provides for the right
 "to express and propagate opinions," citizens are not, in practice, free to express
 their public opposition to the Government in speech or writing. Press criticism of
 ruling family personalities and of government policy regarding certain sensitive sub-
 jects-such as sectarian unrest and the dispute with Qatar over the Hawar Is-
 lands-are strictly prohibited. However, local press coverage and commentary on
 international issues is open, and discussion of local economic and commercial issues
 is also relatively unrestricted. Many individuals express critical opinions openly on
 domestic political and social issues in private settings but do not do so to leading
 government officials or in public forums.
 The Information Ministry exercises sweeping control over all local media. News-
 papers are privately owned, but they routinely exercise self-censorship of stories on
 sensitive topics. The Government does not condone unfavorable coverage of its do-
 mestic policies by the international media and has occasionally revoked the press
 credentials of offending journalists. Since the Ministry also sponsors foreign journal-
 ists' residence permits, this action can lead to deportation. In July the Government
 revoked the press credentials of a resident Deutche Presse-Agentur correspondent
 and ordered her out of the country on grounds that she had endangered the coun-
 try's national security by filing an unsubstantiated report on local political develop-
 ments. The Government generally afforded foreign journalists access to the country
 and did not limit their contacts on the island.
 The State owns and operates all radio and television stations. Radio and tele-
 vision broadcasts in Arabic and Farsi from neighboring countries and Egypt can be
 received without interference. However, international news services, including the
 Associated Press, United Press International, and Agence France Presse, frequently
 complain about press restrictions. The Cable News Network is available on a 24-
 hour basis by subscription and the British Broadcasting Corporation world news
 service is carried on a local channel 24 hours a day free of charge. However, the
 Government generally jams wholly or partially foreign broadcasts that carry
 antigovernment programming or commentary (see Section 1.f.).
 Many senior government officials, ruling family members, and major hotels use
 satellite dishes to receive international broadcasts, as do well-to-do private citizens.
 The Ministry of Information closely controls access to satellite dishes, and the im-
 portation or installation of dishes without prior government approval is illegal.
 Access to the Internet is provided through the National Telephone Company
 (BATELCO). A government-controlled proxy prohibits user access to sites considered
 to be antigovernment or anti-Islamic; E-mail access to information is unimpeded, al-
 though it may be subject to monitoring (see Section 1.f.).
 Although there are no formal regulations limiting academic freedom, in practice
 academics try to avoid contentious political issues. University hiring and admissions
 policies appear to favor Sunnis and others who are assumed to be supportive of the
 Government, rather than focus on professional experience and academic qualifica-
 tions.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-Despite the Constitution's pro-
 vision for the right of free assembly, the Government prohibits all public political
 demonstrations and meetings and controls religious gatherings that may take on po-
 litical overtones. Permits are required for most other public gatherings and permis-
 sion is not routinely granted. Unauthorized public gatherings of more than five per-
 sons are prohibited by law. The Government monitors gatherings that might take
 on a political tone and frequently disperses such meetings.
 On numerous occasions during the year, the security forces used force, including
 tear gas, to disperse gatherings during which protesters called for the reestablish-
 ment of an elected parliament and the release of prisoners, objected to Al-Khalifa
 
 
 1419
 rule, denounced police brutality, protested foreigners in the security forces and in
 the labor force, or demanded increased employment opportunities. After each of
 these incidents, suspected leaders and active participants were arrested.
 The Constitution provides for the right of free association; however, the Govern-
 ment restricts freedom of association. The Government prohibits political parties
 and organizations. Some professional societies and social/sports clubs have tradition-
 ally served as forums for discreet political discussion, but they are restricted by law
 from engaging in political activity. Only the Bahraini Bar Association is exempt
 from the regulations that require that the constitution of all associations include a
 commitment to refrain from political activity. The Bar Association successfully ar-
 gued that a lawyer's professional duties may require certain political actions, such
 as interpreting legislation or participating in a politically sensitive trial. Other orga-
 nized discussions and meetings are still actively discouraged.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-Islam is the state religion and the population is over-
 whelmingly Muslim. However, Christians and other non-Muslims, including Jews,
 Hindus, and Baha'is are free to practice their religion, maintain their own places
 of worship, and display the symbols of their religion. Bibles and other Christian
 publications are displayed and sold openly in local bookstores which also sell Islamic
 and other religious literature. Some small groups worship in their homes. Notables
 from virtually every religion and denomination visit Bahrain and frequently meet
 with government and civic leaders. Religious tracts of all Islamic sects, cassettes of
 sermons delivered by Muslim preachers from other countries, and publications of
 other religions are readily available.
 Proselytizing by non-Muslims is discouraged, anti-Islamic writings are prohibited,
 and conversions from Islam to other religions, while not illegal, are not well toler-
 ated by society.
 Both Sunni and Shi'a are subject to governmental control and monitoring. During
 the year, the Government frequently closed mosques and ma'tams (Shi'a community
 centers) in certain locations to prevent religious leaders from delivering political
 speeches during their Friday prayers and sermons. The High Council for Islamic Af-
 fairs is charged with review and approval of all clerical appointments within both
 the Sunni and Shi'a communities and maintains program oversight for all citizens
 studying religion abroad. Public religious events, most notably the large annual
 commemorative marches by Shi'a, are permitted but are closely watched by the po-
 lice. There are no restrictions on the number of citizens permitted to make pilgrim-
 ages to Shi'a shrines and holy sites in Iran, Iraq, and Syria. However, due to condi-
 tions in Iraq, very few citizens make pilgrimages there. The Government monitors
 travel to Iran and scrutinizes carefully those who choose to pursue religious study
 there. Travel to Iran for pilgrimages, business trips, tourism, and family visits, how-
 ever, is not forbidden.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-Citizens are free to move within the country and change their place of
 residence or work. Passports, however, may be denied on political grounds. Approxi-
 mately 3 percent of the indigenous population, the "bidoon," or stateless persons,
 mostly Persian-origin Shi'a, do not have passports and cannot readily obtain them,
 although they may be given travel documents as Bahraini residents (see section 5).
 The Government occasionally grants citizenship to resident non-Bahrainis who are
 Sunni Muslims, mostly from the Arabian peninsula and Egypt.
 Citizens living abroad who are suspected of political or criminal offenses may face
 arrest and trial upon return to Bahrain. Under the 1963 Citizenship Law, the Gov-
 ernment may reject applications to obtain or renew passports for reasonable cause,
 but the applicant has the right to appeal such decisions before the High Civil Court.
 The Government has also issued temporary passports, good for one trip within a
 year, to individuals whose travel it wishes to control or whose claim to Bahraini na-
 tionality is questionable. Noncitizen residents, including bidoon of Iranian origin,
 may also obtain Bahraini laissez passers (travel documents), usually valid for 2
 years and renewable at Bahraini embassies overseas. Laissez passer holders also re-
 quire visas to reenter Bahrain.
 Bahrain does not usually accept refugees due to its small size and limited re-
 sources. In practice, however, refugees who arrive in Bahrain are not repatriated
 to countries from which they have fled. Many Iranian emigres who fled Iran after
 the Iranian Revolution have been granted permission to remain in Bahrain, but
 they have not been granted citizenship. Although the Government cooperates with
 the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees to the maximum extent possible, it has
 not formulated a formal policy regarding refugees, asylees, or first asylum.
 
 
 1420
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens do not have the right or ability peacefully to change their government
 or their political system, and political activity is strictly controlled by the Govern-
 ment. Since the dissolution of the National Assembly in 1975, there have been no
 formal democratic political institutions. The Prime Minister makes all appointments
 to the Cabinet. All other government positions are filled by the relevant ministries.
 About one-third of the cabinet ministers are Shi'a Muslim, although they do not
 hold security-related offices. The ordinary citizen may attempt to influence govern-
 ment decisions through submission of personal written petitions and informal con-
 tact with senior officials, including appeals to the Amir, the Prime Minister, and
 other officials at their regularly scheduled public audiences, called majises.
 In 1992 the Amir established by decree a Consultative Council (Majlis A1-Shura).
 Its 40 members are divided evenly between Sunni and Shi'a and are appointed by
 the Amir. They are selected to represent major constituent groups, including rep-
 resentatives from the business, labor, professional, and religious communities. There
 are no members of the ruling A1-Khalifa family or religious extremists in the Majlis.
 In addition to legislation submitted for its review by the Cabinet, the Majlis also
 may initiate debate independently on non-political issues. The Majlis may also sum-
 mon cabinet ministers to answer questions, but its recommendations are not binding
 on the Government. The Majls held its fifth session from October 1996 to May and
 began a new session on October 7.
 In 1997 the Majlis debated a number of contentious social and economic issues,
 including unemployment, privatization, and delivery of social services, drafting pro-
 posals on these and other subjects for government consideration. According to the
 Speaker of the MaJlis, the Government responded favorably to the majority of the
 Majlis' recommendations by incorporating them into legislation or by taking other
 appropriate actions. In September the Consultative Council publicly rejected a Euro-
 pean Parliament resolution that criticized the human rights situation in Bahrain.
 There are no women either in the Consultative Council or at the ministerial levels
 of government. The majority of women who choose to work in government are in
 a support capacity and only a few have attained senior positions within their respec-
 tive ministries or agencies.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 There are no local human rights organizations. Because of the restrictions on free-
 dom of association and expression, any independent, domestically-based investiga-
 tion or public criticism of the Government's human rights policies faces major obsta-
 cles. A number of groups based abroad report on alleged human rights violations.
 These include the Damascus-based Committee for the Defense of Human Rights in
 Bahrain, the London-based Bahrain Freedom Movement, the Beirut-based Islamic
 Front for the Liberation of Bahrain, and the Copenhagen-based Bahrain Human
 Rights Organization, formerly the Committee for the Defense of Political Prisoners
 inBahrain. These groups are composed of small numbers of emigres living in self-
 imposed exile and reportedly receive funding from sources hostile to the Govern-
 ment. They are viewed by many local observers as espousing a political, rather than
 a purely human rights, agenda.
 The Government maintains that it is not opposed to visits by bona fide human
 rights organizations. In practice, however, international human rights organizations
 have found it difficult to conduct activities in Bahrain. In October 1996 the Govern-
 ment invited the ICRC to undertake visits to the country's prisons. The visits con-
 tinued throughout 1997 and, while the ICRC has maintained its usual standards
 of confidentiality regarding its findings, credible reports indicate that conditions
 throughout the penal system have improved.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution states that "liberty, equality, security, tranquillity, education, so-
 cial solidarity, and equal opportunities for citizens shall be pillars of society assured
 by the State." It further states that every citizen shall have the right to medical
 care, welfare, education, property, capital, and work. In practice, however, these
 rights are unevenly protected, depending on the individual's social status, ethnicity,
 or sex.
 Women.-Violence against women occurs, but incidents are usually kept within
 the family. In general there is little public attention to, or discussion of violence
 against women. No overnment policies explicitly address violence against women.
 Women's groups andhealth care professionals state that spouse abuse is common,
 
 
 1421
 
 particularly in poorer communities. There are very few known instances of women
 seeking legal redress for violence. Anecdotal evidence suggests that the courts are
 not receptive to such cases.
 Cases are not uncommon in which foreign women working as domestic workers
 are beaten or sexually abused. Numerous cases have been reported to local embas-
 sies and the police. Most victims, however, are too intimidated to sue their employ-
 ers. Those who do so appear to be received sympathetically in the courts.
 Islamic law (Shari'a) governs the legal rights of women. Specific rights vary ac-
 -ording to Shi'a or Sunni interpretations of Islamic law, as determined by the indi-
 vidual a faith, or by the court in which various contracts, including marriage, have
 been made.
 While both Shi'a and Sunni women have the right to initiate a divorce, religious
 courts may refuse the request. Although local religious courts may grant a divorce
 to Shi'a women in routine cases, occasionally Shi'a women seeking divorce under un-
 usual circumstances must travel abroad to seek a higher ranking opinion than is
 available in the country. Women of either sect may own and inherit property and
 may represent themselves in all public and legal matters. In the absence of a direct
 male heir, Shi'a women may inherit all property. In contrast, Sunni women-in the
 absence of a direct male heir-inherit only a portion; the balance is divided among
 brothers, uncles, and male cousins of the deceased.
 In the event of divorce, the courts routinely grant Shi'a and Sunni women custody
 of daughters under the age of 9 and sons under age 7, although custody usually re-
 verts to the father once the children reach those ages. In all circumstances except
 mental incapacitation, the- father, regardless of custody, retains the right to make
 certain legal decisions for his children such as guardianship of any property belong-
 ing to the child until the child reaches legal age. A non-Bahraini woman automati-
 cally loses custody of her children if she divorces their Bahraini father. Women may
 obtain passports and leave the country without the permission of the male head of
 the household. Women are free to work outside the home, to drive cars without es-
 corts, to wear the clothing of their choice, and have increasingly taken jobs pre-
 viously reserved for men. The Labor Law does not discriminate against women;
 however, in practice, there is discrimination in the workplace, including inequality
 of wages anddenial of opportunity for advancement. Women constitute over 20 per-
 cent of the work force. The Government has encouraged the hiring of women, en-
 acted special laws to promote female entry into the work force, and is a leading em-
 ployer of women. The Labor Law does not recognize the concept of equal pay for
 equal work, and women are generally paid less than men. Generally, women work
 outside the home during the years between secondary school or university and mar-
 riage. Some women complain that admissions policies at the National University are
 aimed at increasing the number of male students at the expense of qualified female
 applicants, especially Shi'a women. Nevertheless, women make up the majority of
 students at the country's universities.
 There are women's organizations that seek to improve the status of women under
 both civil and Islamic law. Some women have expressed the view that, despite their
 participation in the work force, women's rights are not significantly advancing and
 that much of the lack of progress is due to the influence of Islamic religious tradi-
 tionalists. Other women, however, desire a return to more traditional values and
 support calls for a return to traditional Islamic patterns of social behavior.
 Children.-The Government has often stated its commitment to the protection of
 children's rights and welfare within the social and religious framework of this tradi-
 tional society. It honors this commitment through enforcement of its civil and crimi-
 nal laws and extensive social welfare network. Public education for children below
 the age of 15 is free. While the Constitution calls for compulsory education at the
 primary levels, authorities do not enforce attendance. Limited medical services for
 infants and pre-adolescents are provided free of charge.
 The social status of children is shaped by tradition and religion to a greater ex-
 tent than by civil law. Public discussion of child abuse is rare, and the preference
 of the authorities always has been to leave such matters within the purview of the
 family or religious groups. The authorities actively enforce the laws against pros-
 titution, including child prostitution, procuring, and pimping. Violators are dealt
 with harshly and can be imprisoned, or if non-Bahraini, deported. In some cases,
 authorities reportedly will return children arrested for prostitution and other non-
 political crimes to their families rather than prosecute them, especially for first of-
 fenses. Some legal experts have called on the Government to establish a separate
 juvenile court. Other citizens, however, insist that the protection of children is a re-
 ligious, not a secular, function and oppose greater government involvement. Inde-
 pendent and quasi-governmental organizations such as the Bahraini Society for the
 Protection of Children and the Mother and Child Welfare Society play an active part
 
 
 1422
 
 in protecting children by providing counseling, legal assistance, advice, and, in some
 cases, shelter and financial support to distressed children and families.
 Detentions and arrests of juveniles, some as young as 7 years old, were numerous
 during the year in connection with the political unrest. These children were gen-
 erally released without charges within several days of their arrests. However, those
 juveniles charged with security offenses received the same treatment as adult pris-
 oners, i.e., incommunicado detention and trial before a State Security Court.
 People with Disabilities.-The law protects the rights of people with disabilities
 and a variety of governmental, quasi-governmental, and religious institutions are
 mandated to support and protect disabled persons. The regional (Arabian Gulf) Cen-
 ter for the Treatment of the Blind is headquartered in Bahrain and a similar Center
 for the Education of Deaf Children was established in 1994. Society tends to view
 people with disabilities as special cases in need of protection rather than as fully
 functioning members of society. Nonetheless, the Government is required by law to
 provide vocational training for disabled persons wishing to work and maintains a
 list of certified, trained disabled persons. The Labor Law of 1976 also requires that
 any employer of over 100 people must engage at least 2 percent of its employees
 from the Government's list of disabled workers. The Ministry of Labor and Social
 Affairs works actively to place people with disabilities in public sector jobs, such as
 in the public telephone exchanges. The Government's housing regulations require
 that access be provided to disab ed persons. Greater emphasi  as been given in re-
 cent years to public building design that incorporates access for the disabled.
 Religious Minorities.-Although there are notable exceptions, the Sunni Muslim
 minorty enjoys a favored status in Bahrain. Sunnis generally receive preference for
 employment in sensitive government positions and in the managerial ranks of the
 civil service. Shi'a citizens are not allowed to hold significant posts in the Barain
 defense and internal security forces. In the private sector, Shi'a tend to be employed
 in lower paid, less skilled jobs.
 Educational, social, and municipal services in most Shi'a neighborhoods, particu-
 larly in rural villages, are inferior to those found in Sunni urban communities. In
 an effort to remedy social discrimination, the Government has built numerous sub-
 sidized housing complexes open to all citizens on the basis of financial need. In an
 effort to ease both the housing shortage and strains on the national budget, in 1997
 the Government revised its policy in order to permit lending institutions to finance
 mortgages on apartment units.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-A group of approximately 9,000 to 15,000
 perso ns, mostly Shi'a of Persian-origin, but including some Christians, are stateless.
 are commonly known as bidoon and enjoy less than full citizenship under the
 Citizenship Act of 1963. Many of the bidoon are second- or third-generation resi-
 dents whose ancestors emigrated from Iran. Although they no longer claim Iranian
 citizenship, they have not been granted Bahraini nationality. Without citizenship
 these individuals officially are unable to buy land, start a business, or obtain gov-
 ernment loans, although in practice many do. The law does not address the citizen-
 ship rights of perso who were not registered with the authorities prior to 1959,
 creating a lealproblem for such persons and their descendants and resulting in
 econonoc and other hardships. The Government maintains that many of those who
 claim to be bidon are actually citizens of Iran or other Gulf states who have volun-
 tarily chosen not to renew their foreign passports. Bidoon and satraiis who speak
 Farsi, rather than Arabic, as their fizrst language also face significant social and eco-
 nomic obstacles, including difficulty findng employment.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Associction.-The partially suspended 1973 Constitution recog-
 nizes the right of workers to organize, but internationally affiliated trade unions do
 not exist. The Constitution provides for "freedom to form associations and trade
 unions on national bases and for lawful objectives and by peaceful means," in ac-
 cordance with the law, and states that "No person shall be compelled to join or re-
 main in any association or union."
 In response to labor unrest in the mid-1950's, 1965, and 1974, the Government
 passed a series of labor regulations, which, among other things, allow the formation
 of elected workers' committees in larger companies. Worker representation is based
 on a system of Joint Labor-Management Committees (JLC's) established by ministe-
 rial decree. Between 1981 and 1984, 12 JLC's were established in the major state-
 owned industries. Four new JLC's were established in 1994 in the private sector,
 including one in a major hotel. The Government is considering the lurther expan-
 sion of the JLC system into the tourism and banking sectors.
 The JLC's are composed of equal numbers of appointed management representa-
 tives and worker representatives elected from and by company employees. Each
 
 
 1423
 committee is chaired alternately by the management and worker representative.
 The selection of worker representatives appears to be fair; under the law the Min-
 istry of Interior may exclude worker candidates with criminal records or those
 deemed a threat to national security.
 The elected labor representatives of the JLC's select the 11 members of the Gen-
 eral Committee of Bahrain Workers (GCBW), established in 1983 by law, which
 oversees and coordinates the work of the JLC's. The committee also hears com-
 plaints from Bahraini and foreign workers and assists them in bringing their com-
 plaints to the attention of the Ministry of Labor or the courts. In 1995 elections
 were held for 3-year terms for representatives to the GCBW. Workers from all types
 of occupations were elected to the body in 1995, including Sunni and Shi'a Muslims,
 foreign workers, and, for the first time, a woman. These elections, which were by
 secret ballot and appeared to be free, were carried out during the worst of the dem-
 onstrations.
 Although the Government and company management are not represented on the
 GCBW, the Ministry of Labor closely monitors the body's activities. It approves the
 GCBW's rules and the distribution of GCBW funds. The JLC-GCBW system rep-
 resents nearly 70 percent of the island's indigenous industrial workers, although
 both government and labor representatives readily admit that nonindustrial work-
 ers and foreign workers are clearly underrepresented in the system. The Ministry
 of Labor and Social Affairs supports the formation of JLC's in all public and private
 sector companies that employ more than 200 workers.
 Although foreign workers constitute 67 percent of the work force, they are under-
 represented in the GCBW. Foreign workers can and do participate in the JLC elec-
 tions, and five foreign workers currently serve on JLC's. None, however, currently
 sits on the board ofthe GCBW. It is a longterm goal of both the Government and
 the GCBW to replace foreign workers with citizens throughout all sectors of the
 economy and to create new jobs for citizens seeking employment.
 The Labor Law is silent on the right to strike, and there were no strikes during
 the year. Actions perceived to be detrimental to the "existing relationship" between
 employers and employees or to the economic health of the State are forbidden by
 the 1974 Security Act. There are no recent examples of major strikes, but walkouts
 and other job actions have been known to occur without governmental intervention
 and with positive results for the workers.
 The GCBW represents workers in the Arab Labor Organization, but does not be-
 long to any international trade union organizations.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-As in the case of strikes, the
 Labor Law neither grants nor denies workers the right to organize and bargain col-
 lectively outside the JLC system. While the JLC's are empowered to discuss labor
 disputes, organize workers' services, and discuss wages, working conditions, and
 productivity, the workers have no independent, recognized vehicle for representing
 their interests on these or other labor-related issues. Minimum wage rates for public
 sector employees are established by Council of Ministers' decrees. Private businesses
 generally follow the Government's lead in establishing their wage rates.
 There are two export processing zones. Labor law and practice are the same in
 these zones as in the rest of the country.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced or compulsory labor is pro-
 hibited by law. In practice, the labor laws apply for the most part only to citizens,
 and abuses, particularly of domestic workers and those working illegally, are known
 to occur. In some cases, workers arrive in Bahrain under the sponsorship of an em-
 ployer and then switch jobs, while continuing to pay a fee to their original sponsor.
 The Government has announced its intention to abolish this illegal practice, which
 makes it difficult to monitor and control the employment conditions of domestic and
 other workers. However, no substantive action has yet been taken.
 Labor law amendments passed in 1993 stiffened the penalties for job switching
 to include jail sentences of up to 6 months for the sponsor of every illegally-spon-
 sored worker. In such cases, the workers involved are likely to be deported as illegal
 immigrants after the case is concluded. During the summer and fall, the Govern-
 ment conducted an amnesty program under which undocumented foreign workers
 were permitted either to legalize their status or leave the country without penalty.
 As many as 38,000 workers opted to participate in the amnesty program.
 The sponsorship system leads to other abuses as well. There are numerous reports
 that employers withhold salaries from their foreign workers for months, even years,
 at a time, and may refuse to grant them the necessary permission to leave the coun-
 try. The Government and the courts generally work to rectify those abuses brought
 to their attention, but fear of deportation or employer retaliation prevents many for-
 eign workers from making complaints to the authorities.

 Labor laws do not apply to domestic servants. There are credible reports that do-
 mestic servants, especially women, are sometimes forced to work 12- or 16-hour
 days, given little time off, and are subjected to verbal and physical abuse.
 Thelaw also prohibits force and bonded child labor, ant the Government enforces
 this prohibition effectively.
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment.-The law
 prohibits force and bonded child labor, and the Government enforces this prohibition
 effectively (see Section 6.c.). The minimum age for employment is 14 years of age
 Juveniles between the ages of 14 and 16 may not be employed in hazardous coni-
 tions or at night and may not work more than 6 hours per day or on a piecemeal
 basis. Child labor laws are effectively enforced by Ministry of Labor inspectors in
 the industrial sector; child labor outside that sector is less well monitored but is not
 believed to be significant outside family operated businesses.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-Minimum wage scales, set by government de-
 cree, exist for public sector employees and generally afford a decent standard of liv-
 ing for workers and their families. The minimum wage for the public sector is
 $278.25 (105 dinars) a month. Wages in the private sector are determined on a con-
 tract basis. For foreign workers, employers consider benefits such as annual trips
 home and housing and education bonuses as part of the salary.
 The Labor Law, enforced by the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs, mandates
 acceptable conditions of work for all adult workers, including adequate standards
 regarding hours of work (maximum 48 hours per week) and occupational safety and
 health.
 The Ministry enforces the law with periodic inspections and fines routinely im-
 posed on violators. The press often performs an ombudsman function on labor prob-
 lems, reporting job disputes and the results of labor cases brought before the courts.
 Once a complaint has ben lodged by a worker, the Ministry of Labor opens an in-
 vestigation and often takes remedial action. The Fourth High Court (Labor) has ju-
 risdiction over cases involving alleged violations of the Labor Law.
 Complaints brought before te Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs that cannot
 be settled through arbitration must, by law, be referred to the court within 15 days.
 In practice, most employers p refer to settle such dis putes through arbitration, par-
 ticularly since the court and labor law are generally considered to favor the em-
 ployee. Under the Labor Law, workers have the right to remove themselves from
 dangerous work situations without jeopardy to their continued employment. In 1993
 the Government strengthened the Labor Law by Amiri decree, announcing that sig-
 nificant fines and jail sentences would be imposed upon private-sector employers
 who fail to pay legal wages. This law applies equally to employers of citizens and
 foreign workers and is intended to reduce abuses against foreign workers who have
 sometimes been denied legal salaries (see Section 6.c.). The law provides equal pro-
 tection to Bahrain/and foreign workers, but all foreign workers still require spon-
 sorship by Barainis or Bahrain-based institutions andcompanies. Foreign workers,
 particulariy those from developingcountries, are often unwilling to report abuses for
 bear of losing residence rights and having to return to their native countries. Spon-
 sors are able to cancel the residence permit of any person under their sponsorship
 and thereby block them for 1 year from obtaining entry or residence visas from an-
 other sponsor, although the sponsor may be subject to sanctions for wrongful dismis-
 sal.
 The Labor Law specifically favors citizens over foreign workers, and Arab expatri-
 ates over other foreign workers, in hiring and firing. Because employers include
 housing and other allowances in their salary scales, foreign workers legally can be
 paid lower regular wages than their Bahraii counterparts, although they some-
 times receive the same or a greater total compensation package because of home
 leave and holiday allowances. Western foreign  workers and Bahraini workers are
 paid comparable wages, with total compensation packages often significantly greater
 for the former. Women are entitled to 60 days of paid maternity leave and nursing
 periods during the day. However, women are generally paid less than men.
