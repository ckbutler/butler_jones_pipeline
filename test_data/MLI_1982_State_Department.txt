 M4ALI
 Mali is one of the poorest third world countries, with an
 economy based on agriculture and animal husbandry. After
 independence, Mali was ruled by a single leader following
 a socialist philosophy strongly influenced by Marxism-
 Leninism. In 1968 this regime was replaced by a small group
 of military officers, who have since brought civilians into
 the governing bodies and have begun to liberalize the
 economy. The Government is currently controlled by one of
 the leaders of the 1968 coup, General Moussa Traore, and the
 nationalist party he has organized. The majority of party
 officials are now civilians. NO other political parties are
 permitted, and there is no organized political opposition in
 Mali.
 Traditionally, Malians have governed themselves by consen-*
 sus, under the leadership of a local notable and his coun-
 selors. The current regime has declared the goal of foster-
 ing civilian rule and democratic practice. In 1981-82,
 elections from the local to the national levels in party and
 state institutions introduced some freedom of choice among
 candidates at the lowest levels, especially in the party
 balloting. Within the last year, the Government has also
 moved to decrease the role of the state sector in Mali's
 economy.
 The right to the integrity of the person and civil rights
 are officially guaranteed, and to some extent are supported
 by administrative procedures. Avenues of recourse in the
 event rights are abused tend to be through personal influ-
 ence rather than through official channels, however. Po-
 litical rights are circumscribed by the party, which limits
 electoral choices and restricts public debate and assembly
 to party fora only. There is no threat to Mali at this time
 from terrorist groups either internally or externally based.
 During 1982, there was no civil strife in Mali. The Govern-
 ment, sensitive to its human rights record, released in
 mid-1981 the last of the students and teachers detained in
 connection with school strikes and demonstrations in 1979-80.
 There were no known new arrests of political prisoners, and
 union strikes were settled without violence. Some individ-
 uals who were associated with leaders of a 1978 coup attempt,
 however, are still prevented from finding new jobs. There
 is a recent trend toward more freedom of electoral choice,
 within the context of the single party. The Government has
 enunciated its desire to encourage private sector economic
 activity, but it has yet to establish a policy framework to
 implement this desire.
 1.   Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Killing
 During 1982 there were no reported instances of killing
 for political motives in Mali.
 b. Disappearance
 During 1982 there were no reported instances of disappear-
 ance in Mali.
 
 
 196
 c. Torture
 Although neither a generalized punishment nor a commonly
 discussed complaint, torture, consisting principally of
 beating suspects, is an occasional practice at police
 stations in the course of interrogations. This is some-
 times the only punishment attached to a crime.
 d. Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 There are relatively few prisoners in Mali, and prison
 conditions are not cruel or degrading. They are, however,
 severe for lack of adequate food, hygiene, and medical care.
 The abuses mentioned in paragraph Ic are typical only of
 short term detentions at police stations but not of treat-
 ment accorded the small number who actually enter the prison
 system. Prisoners usually have access to family, friends,
 attorneys, and others. An exception is the small number of
 prisoners, sometimes political ones from the period before
 1978, who are confined in a remote northern Saharan area
 where the terrain acts as a maximum security environment.
 Most of the long-term political prisoners have also been
 convicted on corruption charges. Their numbers are de-
 creasing as those considered too old or sick to pose a
 threat to the regime are released. On September 22, 1982,
 Independence Day, the President pardoned 18 prisoners,
 including at least one political detainee, and diminished
 the sentences of 27 others.
 e. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 During 1982 there were no reported instances of arbi-
 trary arrest. Malian law does not recognize the principle
 of habeas corpus or its equivalent. Because of the slow pace
 ofadministrative processing, persons awaiting trial are often
 detained for considerable periods, and sufficient funds for
 their upkeep have usually not been budgeted by the Government.
 As a result, prison conditions are worse if a large number
 of detainees awaiting trial are on hand at a given time.
 Recently, the Government has made efforts to bring detainees
 to trial more quickly.
 f. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Pretrial proceedings are sometimes protracted, and state
 employees charged with corruption are frequently held for
 years, until they have paid back most or all of the funds
 they embezzled. Trials, on the other hand, are usually very
 short. Charges are clearly stated, and the defendant has
 usually admitted his guilt. Lawyers generally argue miti-
 gating circumstances. The appeals process is limited to
 presentation of important verdicts to the President, who
 may issue pardons or call for a new trial. The judici-
 ary is an arm of, rather than independent from, the execu-
 tive. The special court of state security, which handles
 only cases of diversion or embezzlement of government funds,
 operates as regular criminal courts do.
 g. Invasion of the Home
 The Constitution guarantees the inviolability of the home.
 Search warrants are issued by the security service effecting
 the search, and are diligently recorded, if sometimes after
 the fact. Such searches are infrequent.

 2.   Respect for Civil and Political Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Freedom of the press is not specifically guaranteed by the
 1974 Malian Constitution. The state owns and operates all
 Malian media with the single exception of a private news
 periodical, launched in November 1982, that has published
 one issue. The Government does not permit criticism of its
 authority. Criticism of specific programs and policies
 (sometimes on important domestic issues), of aspects of
 the society, or of the performance of government offices
 (but not individual officials) is, however, sometimes
 allowed. Private publication of unauthorized opinions on
 political or economic policy questions is not sanctioned,
 and exposes authors, distributors, and recipients to the
 possibility of arrest. Journalists, all of whom are govern-
 ment employees, have been subject to suspension without pay
 for 'impertinent' questioning of interviewees. Nonetheless,
 international newspapers and magazines generally circulate
 freely in Mali, even when they contain articles critical of
 the Government. President Traore does solicit local criti-
 cism and viewpoints on his occasional visits throughout
 Mali, as do regional and local officials. In public mee-
 tings, organized when a government dignitary visits, Malians
 are encouraged to express their local needs and problems.
 These discussions are frequently vigorous and are not
 known to lead to retribution.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Constitution guarantees the right to strike and the
 right of all persons to organize and belong to unions or
 professional organizations of their choice. But in prac-
 tice, the labor movement is closely supervised by the
 Government. Although union and party officials proclaim the
 national union to be organizationally separate and indepen-
 dent of party control, no group is allowed to form an inde-
 pendent, alternative union.  (Teachers were denied this
 right in 1981.) Union officials, though elected by union
 members, must be acceptable to party leaders. However,
 union leaders often express opinions contrary to government
 policy and are frequently consulted by government authorities
 on labor issues. The twelve affiliate unions of the national
 union hold triennial congresses where officials are elected
 and a national congress selects officials of the national
 labor movement. Most salaried workers in Mali are union mem-
 bers, and strikes are permitted. During 1981 and 1982 there
 were only minor strikes, centering around payment of back
 wages. All were settled peacefully and within a few days.
 Permits are required for large groups to assemble for
 religious and social purposes. They are usually granted,
 sometimes on an annual basis.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Mali is a secular state, and the Government carefully holds
 to a policy of not discriminating on religious grounds.
 While the majority religion is Islam, Christian missionaries
 find the Government cooperative and generally impartial.
 They operate in both animist and Muslim areas. Although the
 Baha'i sect is forbidden to propagate its views, the Baha'is
 and others are free to practice their religion without
 hinderance.
 
 
 198
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Freedom of movement in Mali is generally unimpeded, although
 travelers are sometimes subject to police checks, especially
 at night. These are allowed by law, ostensibly to restrict
 the movement of stolen or contraband goods. In practice,
 the underpaid police often use document checks and vehicle
 searches to assess fines for minor infractions and so
 provide themselves with additional income. Malians must
 obtain an exit visa to travel abroad, but there are no
 barriers to emigration or repatriation. There are no
 refugees in Mali.
 e. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 The Malian Government is headed by General Moussa Traore,
 who is Secretary General of the single political party, the
 Democratic Union of the Malian People, as well as President
 and Chief of the Security Forces. Traore governs through a
 19-member Central Executive Bureau of the party and, secon-
 darily, through a Council of Ministers. He heads both
 bodies. The party, established by Traore in 1979 as a
 step toward civilian rule, is intended to "mobililze the
 population' and to function as the main vehicle for "articu-
 lating the popular will", but it has only begun to attempt
 to fulfill that role. The party's 1981-82 local elections,
 however, were open to party members desiring to run, and
 most posts were actively contested by multiple candidates.
 Anyone who is interested is encouraged to join the party
 and most Malians with fixed addresses and virtually all
 government employees have bought party cards for a small
 sum, officially becoming party members. There were signs
 of increasing interest in the party during 1982 following
 the new Executive Bureau's election at the party congress
 in February.
 National Assembly elections in 1982 were much less open than
 party ones and were managed by the party. For each district,
 local party units nominated three potential assembly candi-
 dates. The party's Central Executive Bureau then reviewed
 these nominations and selected the final slate of one candi-
 date for each assembly slot. Reportedly, the selection
 generally followed the preferences expressed by local party
 organizations. Twelve of the 83 representatives were newly
 chosen in 1982. The National Assembly debates proposed
 legislation in closed sessions and offers confidential
 advice to the Government. But it has never been known to
 reject legislation.
 While women are free to participate in the Malian political
 process and are represented at all levels of the Government
 and the party, the paucity of women officials reflect
 women's traditionally subordinate status. Few women are
 willing to attempt to combine a political career with their
 family responsibilities, and at local political gatherings
 it is generally only male heads of family groupings who take
 part. Nevertheless, a woman cabinet minister (Minister of
 Information) was appointed in July 1980, there is a female
 member of the party's Central Executive Bureau, and there
 are two female deputies in the 83-seat national assembly.
 The party's women's auxiliary, the National Union of Malian
 Women, has strong leadership and plays an active role in
 urging women to exercise their rights.
 
 
 199
 In line with government policy, minority ethnic groups are
 scrupulously represented at the highest state and party
 levels, although the practice of assigning local officials
 to serve outside their native region results in minority
 ethnic groups being underrepresented in their regional
 administrations. There is very little ethnic friction in
 Mali. However, despite government policies to ensure
 representation of minorities in the Government, most Tuaregs
 and other nomadic minorities remain only marginally inte-
 grated into Mali's modern economic and political structures.
 3.   Government Attitude Regarding International and Non-
 governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations of
 Human Rights
 No currently outstanding requests for outside investigation
 of human rights in Mali are known. The Malian Government
 has demonstrated its responsiveness to criticism from inter-
 national human rights groups. In 1980, Amnesty Interna-
 tional advocated the release of several teachers imprisoned
 for trade union activities. In 1981, the teachers were re-
 leased following a meeting in Paris between President Traore
 and Amnesty International representatives. Amnesty's 1982
 Report does cite a number of concerns in Mali: political
 imprisonment, detention and banishment without charge or
 trial, and poor prison conditions. Freedom House, in its
 1982 reports, lists Mali among those countries that are
 *Not Free.   .
 4.   Economic, Social, and Cultural Situation
 Poverty is widespread and pervasive in Mali. The Government
 remains committed to the goal of economic development and a
 better quality of life, and its policies are officially
 focused on responding to the needs of the poor. These needs
 are in general addressed on a non-discriminatory basis,
 although urban dwellers and government employees are at
 an advantage. Mali's plans for economic development are
 severely limited, however, by a lack of natural resources
 and mismanagement of the economy.
 The Government makes a special effort to improve the lot
 of women, and women have entered government employment in
 significant numbers in recent years. They are also repre-
 sented in Malil's small industrial processing sector. Female
 circumcision is widely practiced in Mali but is not sanc-
 tioned by the Government. The party's women's 'uxiliary has
 publicized the disadvantages of this practice in radio broad-
 casts and newspaper articles. The women, however, have
 stopped short of campaigning against it.
 The right to own property is protected in Mali. Access to
 health care depends on proximity to the larger towns.
 A public health mechanism is provided for salaried govern-
 ment employees, but most people receive little or no health
 care., The Government has stated its commitment to provide
 health care at the village level and has encouraged several
 donor-supported projects with this aim.
 Life expectancy at birth has increased from 37 years in
 1968 to 43.12 years in 1980. The infant mortality rate
 in 1980 was 154.4 deaths per 1,000 live births.

 Mali suffered from severe drought in the mid 70's. In 1977
 the average Malian had access to 90 percent of daily caloric
 requirements, down from 94 percent in 1970. According to
 the most recent estimate, approximately nine percent of the
 population has access to safe water. This includes 42
 percent of the urban population and three percent of the
 rural population. According to the Constitution, a free
 education is a right of all Malians. The percentage of the
 budget devoted to education has risen from an estimated
 three percent in 1962 to 30 percent in 1982. The adult
 literacy rate was estimated at 10 percent in 1975, but a
 major program is under way to increase literacy. In
 1978, 28% of the primary school age group was enrolled in
 school. At the opening of the 1982-83 school year, enroll-
 ments were 350,000 (primary), 20,000 (secondary), and 6,000
 (superior schools), respectively.
 The general trend of real per capita gross national product
 has drifted downward in the 22-year period since indepen-
 dence. Per capita GNP in 1980 was estimated at $192.70, for
 a population of 6,801,000. Economic development programs
 are aimed at improving the lives of the country's over-
 whelmingly rural agricultural and nomadic population.
 Bamako's rapidly increasing indigent population continues
 to be the subject of intense concern. The population growth
 rate was 2.8 percent in 1980. Mali's well-defined family
 responsibilities play an important role in supplying a
 buffer for many Malians against unemployment, deprivation
 and old age. These responsibilities also cover other
 Malians who, although not part of the family, serve in
 a retainer status and are economically dependent on the
 family.
