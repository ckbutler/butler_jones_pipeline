 BURMA
 Burma continued to be ruled by a highly authoritarian military regime. The mili-
 tary Government known as the State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC)
 seized power in September 1988 after harshly suppressingmassive prdemocracy
 demonstrations. In November the SLORC announced that the military Government
 had been renamed the State Peace and Development Council (SPDC). The rege
 is headed by armed forces commander General Than Shwe and composed of top
 military officers. Retired dictator General Ne Win, whose idiosyncratic policies had
 isolated Burma and driven the country into deep economic decline, may continue to
 wield considerable influence. The judiciary is not independent of the executive.
 The SLORC permitted a relatively free election in 1990, but it failed to honor the
 results-which were an overwhelming rejection of military rule-and cede power to
 the victorious prodemocracy forces. Instead, the SLORC attacked the coalition of
 winning parties and their leaders through intimidation, detention, and house arrest,
 and redoubled efforts to consolidate and perpetuate its rule. In 1993 the SLORC es-
 tablished the "National Convention," a body ostensibly tasked with drafting a new
 constitution. The SLORC carefully handpicked the delegates, overwhelmingly made
 up of military officers, and stage-managed the constitutional convention's proceed-
 ings, ignoring even limited opposition views. Although the National Convention has
 not been reconvened since 1996, the military government appears determined to
 draft a constitution that will ensure a dominant role for the military services in the
 country's future political structure.
 The Government reinforces its firm military rule with a pervasive security apa-
 ratus led by the military intelligence organization, the Directorate of Defense Serv-
 ices Intelligence (DDSI). Control is buttressed by selective restrictions on contact
 with foreigners, surveillance of government employees and private citizens, harass-
 ment of political activists, intimidation, arrest, detention, and physical abuse. The
 Government~  stifles its security measures as neessary to maintain order and na-
 tional unity. However, most major insurgent gups have reached individual accom-
 modations with the SLORC in recent years, which provide varying levels of stability
 and autonomy from central government control. Members of the security forces com-
 mitted numerous, serious human rights abuses.
 Burma is a poor country, with an estimated average per capita income of $200
 to 300 per year on an exchange rate basis and $700 to $900 on a purchasing-power-
 parity basis. Primarily an agricultural country, it also has substantial mineral, fish-
 ing, and timber resources. Since 1988 the Government has partly opened the econ-
 omy to permit expansion of the small private sector and attract foreign investment.
 Some economic improvement has ensued, but major obstacles to economic reform
 persist. These include extensive overt and covert state -involvement in economic ac-
 
 
 690
 tivity, state monopolization of leading exports, a bloated bureaucracy prone to arbi-
 trary and opaque governance, corruption, poor human and physical infrastructure,
 and disproportionately large military spending.
 The Government's longstanding severe repression of human rights continued dur-
 ing the year. Citizens continued to live subject at any time and without appeal to
 the arbitrary and sometimes brutal dictates of the military dictatorship. Citizens do
 not have the right to change their government. The SLORC has given no sign of
 a willingness to cede its hold on absolute power. There continue to be credible re-
 ports, particularly in ethnic minority-dominated areas, that soldiers committed seri-
 ous human rights abuses, including extrajudicial killings and rape. Disappearances
 continued, and-members of the security forces beat and otherwise abused detainees.
 Prison conditions remained harsh. Arbitrary arrests and detentions continued for
 expression of dissenting political views. Many hundreds--if not more-political pris-
 oners remained in prison, including approximately 31 parliamentarians elected in
 1990. Since May 1996, at least 340 persons have been arrested and imprisoned for
 political reasons, and may remain in prison at year's end. The judiciary is subject
 to executive influence, and the Government infringes on citizens' rights to privacy.
 The SLORC maintained and at times intensified its restrictions on basic rights
 of free speech, press, assembly, and association. Political party activity remained se-
 verely restricted. Although the authorities recognize the chief opposition party, the
 National League for Democracy (NLD), as a legal entity, they prevented the party
 from conducting normal day-to-day political activities. The Government closed many
 party offices throughout the country with no apparent legal justification. The regime
 refused to recognize the legal political status of key NLD party leaders, such as its
 General Secretary Aung San Suu Ky and the two party cochairmen, and it severely
 constrained their activities through security measures and threats. The regime
 stopped a party conference held on May 27 to mark the seventh anniversary of the
 1990 elections by the use of physical restraints on NLD p arty members. The au-
 thorities detained or threatened to detain as many as 300 Members of Parliament-
 elect (MI'."s-elect) and party activists from outside Rangoon to deter attendance.
 They also progressively tightened restrictions imposed in late 1996 on Aung San
 Suu Kyi's freedom to leave her compound and her ability to receive visitors. Al-
 though the Government eased restrictions on NLD gatherings in September that al-
 lowed the party to hold a congress marking the ninth anniversary of its founding,
 thin action was only tempr  as authorities blocked subseent meetings.
 The SLORC's repression Mothe NLD continued with the forcible closure of NLD
 offices upcountry and harassment of NLD members for petty offenses. It forced NLD
 members to work as military   rters and arreste   nd convicted NLD supporters
 of political crimes, especially those associated personally with Aung San SuKyi.
 The Government imposed restrictions on certain religious minorities. In March
 the authorities did little to halt attacks on Muslims hy Buddhist monks. The au-
 thorities initially did little to stop the rioting, and in some cases stood by and
 watched the looting of Muslim property, although they did deter physical harm to
 Muslims themselves. An estimated 42 mosques were damaged or destroyed through-
 out the country. The Government restricted freedom of movement. Thousands of
 citizens fled army attacks against insurgents, and remained in refugee camps in
 Thailand at years end. Discrimination against women and ethnic minorities, vio-
 lence against women, trafficking in women and girls, and widespread adult and
 child prostitution are problems. The Government restricts worker rights, bans
 unions, and uses forced labor tor public works and to produce food for military garri-
 sons. The forced use of citizens as porters by the army-with attendant maltreat-
 ment, illness, and even death for those compelled to se de-remained a common
 practice. The Government did not enforce 1996 military directives to cease the prac-
 tice of forced civilian labor, and the practice remains widespread. Child labor is also
 a problem. The use of forced civilian labor on projects appeared to decrease.
 During the SLORC's antiinsurgency operations, military forces were responsible
 for arbitrary killings, rape, village relocations, the destrction of homes and prp-
 eri, and forced labor inflicted on ethnic minorities.
 Insurgent forces committed numerous abuses, including killings, rapes, and other
 atrocities.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There continued to be many credible
 reports of brutality and the killing of civilians by soldiers, particulary in areas
 dominated by ethnic minorities. Brutal treatment by soldiers also caused deaths
 among those impressed as military porters in areas held by ethnic insurgents. In
 
 
 691
 February soldiers detained approximately 50 NLD leaders and members from
 Toungoo in Rago Division. Of this group, 14 persons were forced into porterage;
 three persons reportedly died as a result. In May in Bago Division, soldiers detained
 a group of 36 NLD members from Kyaukyi. Eight persons were taken as porters;
 one of them died while working as a porter. The Government's general disregard
 for human rights has created a climate that is clearly conducive to such abuses.
 The military forces disregard the safety of noncombatants, and thousands of refu-
 gees continue to flee into neighboring Thailand.
 Various insurgent groups also committed extrajudicial killings.
 b. Disappearance.-As in previous years, private citizens and political activists
 continued to "disappear" temporarily, for periods ranging from several hours to sev-
 eral weeks. DDSI officials usually apprehended individuals for questioning without
 the knowledge of their family members. In many, although not all cases, they re-
 leased them soon afterward. Such action was usually intended to 'prevent free politi-
 cal expression or assembly. At the same time, large numbers of persons continued
 to be forcibly seized by soldiers for porterage or related duties, often without-the
 knowledge of their family members. The whereabouts of those conscripted, as well
 as of prisoners transferred for labor or porterage duties, remain unknown.
 c.Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The authorities routinely subjected detainees to harsh interrogation techniques de-
 signed to intimidate and disorient. The most common forms of mistreatment were
 sleep and food deprivation coupled with around-the-clock questioning; some detain-
 ees were also kicked and beaten. Political detainees were held incommunicado for
 long periods. Credible reports continue that prisoners are forced to squat or assume
 stressful, uncomfortable, or painful positions for lengthy periods.
 There continued to be credible reports that security forces subjected ordinary citi-
 zens to harassment and physical abuse. The military forces routinely confiscated
 property, cash, and food, and used coercive and abusive recruitment methods to pro-
 cure porters. Those forced into porterage or other duties faced extremely difficult
 conditions and mistreatment that sometimes resulted in death (see Section L.a.).
 There were many reports that soldiers raped women who were members of ethnic
 minorities.
 Prison conditions remained harsh. The regimen at Insein Prison near Rangoon re-
 mained extremely harsh including the lack of exercise, mosquito nets, and reading
 materials for some prisoners, poor nutrition, inadequate medical care, and the use
 of solitary confinement and "doggie cells," (small enclosures that remind citizens of
 kennels used during World War II) as punishment. A small number of prominent
 political prisoners were housed in separate bungalow accommodations on the prison
 compound. All prisoners were usually permitted to receive medicine as well as sup-
 plemental food brought by their families during 15-minut visits permitted every 2
 weeks, although there are occasional reports that guards demand bribes for that
 privilege.
 Conditions for poitical prisoners were reported to be much harsher at some
 upcountry locations than in Rangoon; Thayet and Thayawaddy prisons are cited
 most often in this regard. In April the authorities transferred approximately 150
 prisoners--including 59 NLD members-from Insein to upcountry prisons. The inev-
 itable consequence for most prisoners of the transfer from Rangoon was additional
 hardship in the form of reduced access to family support, food, medicine, and cloth-
 ing. However, there have been reports that prison conditions for a number of politi-
 cal prisoners improved late in the year.
 UTin Shwe (Monywa), a former NLD central executive committee member, died
 in Insein prison on June 8. A founding member of the NLD, Tin Shwe had been
 arrested in 1990 and was serving an 18-year sentence when he died of heart disease
 at age 68. After receiving cardiac treatment at Insein Hospital in April, his family
 asked the authorities to allow specialists to see Tin Shwe outside the prison; how-
 ever, authorities denied permission. After prolonged deterioration, he died in cus-
 tody, the sixth NLD member to die in prison since 1988. In September the authori-
 ties did provide timely medical treatment to NLD founding member U Win Tin,
 Aung San Suu Kyi's cousin, Cho Aung Than, Dr. Aung Sint, and three other politi-
 cal prisoners at Rangoon General Hospital.
 The Government does not permit prison visits by human rights monitors.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-There is no provision in the law for judi-
 cial determination of the legality of detention. The SLORC routinely practiced arbi-
 trary arrest and incommunicado detention. Prior to being charged, detainees rarely
 had access to legal counsel or their families and political detainees have no oppor-
 tunity to obtain release on bail. Political detainees are held incommunicado for long
 periods. Even after being charged, detainees rarely have benefit of counsel.
 
 
 As in 1996, the authorities carried out a campaign of detention and intimidation
 to prevent the NLD from holding a party conference. Prior to the NLD's planned
 celebration on May 27 to mark the seventh anniversary of the 1990 election the
 SLORC detained more than 300 NLD Members of Parliament-Elect (M.P.'s-Ilect)
 and activists outside Rangoon and threatened others to prevent them from attend-
 ing the event. Although the authorities subsequently released all the detainees,
 their detentions violated the NLD's right as a legal party to hold a political gather-
 ing (see Section 2.b.).
 In February the authorities arrested four prominent NLD M.P.'s-Elect--all of
 whom are medical doctors--on charges that a peared designed to harass them be-
 cause of their affiliation with the NLD. One doctor, who is also a party organizer
 for Rangoon Division, was jailed for 40 days on charges of operating a clinic without
 a license; eventually he was able to prove that he had applied for a license. While
 charges against the physician and two of his colleagues were later dismissed for lack
 of evidence, another physician with ties to the NLD was convicted on a suspected
 false charge of "negligent homicide" and sentenced to 4 years in prison. -e had
 given an injection to a vagrant who ignored his advice to seek immediate treatment
 in a hospital and subsequently died.
 The military forces forcibly seized citizens to serve as porters during military op-
 erations; at times the brutal treatment that they suffered caused the death of such
 persons (see Sections l.a., *b., and 1.c.).
 Forced exile is not used as a method of political control. However in 1990, when
 the SLORC refused to recognize the results of the elections and pressured successful
 candidates to resign, some candidates, as well as thousands of political activists, re-
 sponded by going mnto exile rather than face threats.
 e. Denial of Fair Public TriaL.-The judiciary is not independent of the executive.
 The SLORC names justices to the Supreme Court who, in turn, appint lower court
 judges with the approval of the SLORr. Pervasive corruption further serves to un-
 dermine the impartiality of the justice system
 The court system, as inherited from the United Kingdom and subsequently re-
 structured, comprised courts at the township, district, state, and national levels.
 Throughout the year, the Government continued to rule by decree and was not
 bound by any constitutional prvisions providing for fair public trials or any other
 rights. Al though remnants of the Britis~-era legal system were formally in place,
 the court Sstem and its operation remained seriously flawed, particularly in the
 handling of political cases. Unprofessional behavior by some court officials, the mis-
 use of overy brad laws, and the manipulation of the courts for political ends con-
 tinued to deprive citizens of the right to a fair trial and the rule of law.
 Some basic due process rights, including the right to a public trial and to be rep-
 resented by a defense attorney, wer  n  rally respeted, except in political cases
 that authorities deemed especially snsictive. Defense attorneys are permitted to call
 and crss-xamine witnesses, but their primary purpose is to bargain with the judge
 to obtain the shortest possible sentence for their clients. Most court proceedings are
 open to the public. However, in political cases, trials are held in courtrooms on pris-
 on compoundsyad asre not open to the public. In these instances, defense counsel
 appears to serve no purpose other than to provide moral support, since reliable re-
 ports indicate that verdicts are dictated by higher authorities.
 The arrest and conviction of three associates of AungSan Suu Kyi llustrates the
 opaque nature of the judicial process under the SLORC regime, which denies de-
 fend ants in political cases the right to a fair public trial. In June the SLORC ar-
 rested Cho Aung Than, his sister Nge Ma Ma Than, and her husband, Myint Swe.
 Authorities tried and sentenced them to 10 years in prison on charges of  a ul
 association" and of allegedly having assisted foreignei (representatives of non-
 governmental organizations (NGO's)) in transferring money to Aung San Suu Kyi.
 C ho Aung Than and Nge Ma Ma Than are Aun       an   uu Kyi's cousins. A fourth
 alleged coconspiratr, Myo AungThant, was also sentenced to 10 years' imprison-
 ment, in addition to life imprisonment for alleged involvement in terrorist attacks.
 These included a packse bomb killing of the daughter of SLORC official Tin  o
 in April. The closed ant opaque judicial process in these cases cast serious doubt
 on the legitimacy of the prceedings.
 In December the SLORC commuted the sentences of those prisoners serving terms
 longer than 10 years. Approximately 60 students and political prisoners arrested be-
 tween 1988 ands1992 had their sentenes redued, making them eigible for release
 within the next few years.
 There are unconfirmed estimates of as many as 1,000 political prisoners. Since
 May 1996, at least 340 poitical prisoners have be en arrested; most remain confined.
 Of the total, 93 are students, 18 are NLD parliamentarians-elect, and 229 are NiLD
 members, supporters, and activists. Of this total, 52 students, all the parliamentar-
 
 
 693
 
 ians-elect, and 110 NLD members and supporters have been tried and sentenced.
 The status of the remaining persons in custody is not known.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence-The
 military authorities ruled unchecked by any outside authority, and the State contin-
 ued to interfere extensively and arbitrarily in the lives of private citizens. Through
 its extensive intelligence network and administrative procedures, the Government
 closely monitored the travel and activities of many citizens, particularly those
 known to be politically active. Authorities sometimes enter homes during night
 hours to check registration documents of occupants as a form of monitoring personal
 movements. Security personnel selectively screened private correspondence and tele-
 phone calls and conducted warrantless searches of private premises and other prop-
 erty. At times the Government attempted to jam foreign radio broadcasts, and citi-
 zens were generally unable to subscribe directly to foreign publications (see Section
 2.a.). Government employees are generally required to obtain advance permission
 before meeting with foreigners.
 The military services forced citizens-including women and children-to work as
 military porters under harsh conditions (see Sections 1.a, 1.b., and 1.g.).
 To make way for commercial or public construction, and in some cases for security
 reasons, the SLORC continued to move people out of cities to peripheral new town
 settlements, although on a smaller scale than during the early 1990's. While facili-
 ties in some of these areas have improved over time, residents targeted for displace-
 ment continued to be given no option but to move, usually on short notice. The mili-
 tary authorities also continued the widespread and frequent practice of forcible relo-
 cation of rural villages in ethnic minority areas in response to security concerns.
 This practice was particularly widespread and egregious in the Shan, Kayah, and
 Karen states, where tens of thousands of villagers were displaced or herded into
 smaller settlements in strategic areas.
 In a number of urban areas, residents were compelled to cede land for road-widen-
 ing projects approved without any public consultation or endorsement. Other long-
 term city residents were required to cede land for commercial redevelopment and
 were compensated at only a fraction of the value of their lost homes. For example,
 the Government forced residents in the Hledan market area of Rangoon to relocate
 to make way for an apartment complex without paying compensation for their
 homes; residents were given the option to buy new apartments outside the city. In
 rural areas, military personnel at times confiscated livestock and food supplies. The
 armed forces also forcibly relocated many villages and citizens during its campaign
 against insurgents (see Section 1.g.).
 g. Use of Excessive Force and Violations of Humanitarian Law In Internal Con-
 flicts.-For nearly 5 decades, the army has battled diverse ethnic insurgencies.
 These ethnic minority insurgent groups have sought to gain greater autonomy, or
 in some cases, independence from the dominant ethnic Burman majority. In 1989
 the SLORC began a policy of seeking cease-fire agreements with most ethnic insur-
 gent greups alongthe borders.
 Following the breakdown of its cease-fire with the separatist Karenni National
 Progressive Party (KNPP) in 1995, the army began an offensive in 1996 against the
 KNPP that continued through year's end. As part of its campaign to deny the guer-
 rillas local support, the military forces forcibly relocated hundreds of villages and
 tens of thousands of Karenni civilians. In central and southern Shan state, the mili-
 tary forces continued to engage the Shan United Revolutionary Army (SURA), a
 remnant of Khun Sa's narcotics-linked former Mong Tai Army, and began a cam-
 paign of relocation against the villagers in the region. Many thousands have been
 forced to move from their villages. There are credible reports of retaliatory killings,
 rapes, and other atrocities committed by the army against civilians.
 The Karen National Union (KNU) is the largest single insurgent group that con-
 tinues to fight against central government rule. In January the fourth round of
 cease-fire talks between the KNU and the SLORC broke down. In February the
 army launched an offensive that pushed the KNU out of its last strongholds in
 Karen state. The KNU lost control of most of its former territory along the Thai
 border. As a result, over 20,000 Karen civilians fled to Thailand.
 In conjunction with the military's campaigns against the Karen, Karenni, and
 Shan insurgents, it was standard practice for the military forces to coerce civilians
 into working as porters in rural areas in or near combat zones. According to testi-
 mony collected by international human rights NGO's from refugees, the men-and
 sometimes women and children as well-who were forced to labor as porters often
 suffered beatings and, on occasion, died as a result of their mistreatment by soldiers
 (see Sections 1.a, 1.b., and .e.). There were reports that soldiers raped female mem-
 bers of ethnic minorities in contested areas.
 
 
 694
 In the regions controlled by insurgent groups engaged in -narcotics trafficking, ci-
 viians were reliably reported to have been sujected to forced labor as well by those
 groups.
 Antigovernment insurgent groups were also responsible for violence including the
 deployment of land mines that caused both civilian and military deaths. The SURA
 insurgents committed retaliatory killings, rapes, and other atrocities against civil-
 ians.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Government continued to impose severe re-
 strictions on freedom of speech and of the press. The security services continued to
 harass and repress those attempting to express opposition political views, and many
 more refrained from speaking out for fear of arrest, interrogation, and other forms
 of intimidation. Since late 1996, the authorities have prohibited the weekend gath-
 erings in front of Aung San Suu Kyi's residence at which she and NLD vice-chair-
 men Tin Oo and Kyi Maung formerly responded to letters from the public and deliv-
 ered speeches. Barriers blocking access to her residence remained in place during
 the year, and her freedom to leave her compound or to receive visitors was severely
 restricted.
 The government monopoly television radio, and newspaper media remained prop-
 aganda instruments. These official media normally did not report opposing views ex-
 cept to criticize them. Editors and reporters remained answerable to military au-
 thorities. While the English language daily New Light of Myanmar continued to in-
 clude many heavily edited international wire service reports on foreign news, do-
 mestic news hewed strictly to and reinforced government policy.
 All forms of domestic public media were officially controlled or censored. This
 strict control in turn encouraged self-censorship on the part of writers and publish-
 ers. Citizens were generally unable to subscribe directly to foreign publications, but
 a limited selection of foreign newspapers could be purchased in a few hotels and
 stores in Rangoon (see Section 1.f.). A limited supply of international news maga-
 zines and a sizable number of private publications on nonpolitical issues were avail-
 able to the public, but censors frequently banned issues or deleted articles deemed
 unwelcome by the Government.
 Monthly press conferences that had begun in August 1996 were suspended by the
 Government in April. Prior to that time, most known foreign journalists, including
 television crews, had been able to obtain visas to visit and report on developments,
 although authorities sometimes monitored and restricted their movements. The
 Government issued few visas to journalists after April.
 Foreign radio broadcasts, such as those of the British Broadcasting Corporation,
 Voice of America, Radio Free Asia, and the Norway-based Democratic Voice of
 Burma, remained the principal sources of uncensored information. The authorities
 at times attempted to jam or otherwise interfere with the reception of these broad-
 casts (see Section 1.f.). They also continued to restrict the reception of satellite tele-
 vision broadcasts. Penalties of up to 3 years' imprisonment for operation of an unli-
 censed satellite television receiver can be imposed. Licenses, however, were almost
 impossible to obtain by citizens, although some ignored the licensing regulation.
 A series of totalitarian decrees issued by the Government in 1996 designed to
 strengthen its control over all forms of political expression and citizens' access to
 information remained in force during the year. Order 5/96 in 1996 prohibited
 speeches or statements that "undermine national stability" as well as the drafting
 of alternative constitutions. A 1996 amendment to the television and video law im-
 posed additional restrictions and stiffer penalties on the distribution of videotapes
 not approved by the censor. Also in 1996, the Government decreed that all comput-
 era, software, and associated telecommunications devices would be subject to govern-
 ment registration. The law required government permission for all communications
 by computer. The Government bars most Internet services to citizens. During the
 year, the authorities granted permission to one Internet service company to provide
 only electronic mail services to any citizen on a fee basis.
 University teachers and professors remained subject to the same restrictions on
 freedom of speech, political activities, and publications as other government employ-
 ees. These included warnings against criticism of the Government; instructions not
 to discuss politics while at work; strictures against joining or supporting political
 parties; engaging in political activity; or meeting foreigners. Teachers continued to
 held responsible for propagating SLORC political goals among their students and
 for maintaining discipline and preventing students from engaging in any unauthor-
 ized political activity.
 Following student demonstrations in December 1996, the Government closed the
 universities and even primary and secondary schools to prevent further demonstra-
 
 
 695
 tions. While the primary and secondary schools reopened in August, most univer-
 sities remained closed at year's end.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Government restricts free-
 dom of assembly. Its prohibition of unauthorized, outdoor assemblies of more than
 five persons remained in effect, albeit unevenly enforced. The 10 existing legal polit-
 ical parties remained formally required to request permission from the authorities
 to hold internal meetings of their members, although some members still met with-
 out official permission.
 The SLORC's repression of the NLD continued; it forcibly closed NLD offices
 upcountry and harassed NLD members for petty offenses, forced NLD members to
 work as porters, and arrested and convicted NLD supporters for political crimes, es-
 rfcially those associated personally with NLD General Secretary Aung San Suu
 In May the authorities blocked the NLD's attempt to hold a party congress on the
 anniversary of the 1990 elections. It temporarily detained orthreatened the deten-
 tion of over 300 party members living outside Rangoon, and sealed off access to
 Aung San Suu Kyi's compound.
 However, in September the authorities abruptly suspended their policy and per-
 mitted the NLD to convene a party congress on the occasion of the ninth anniver-
 sary of the party's founding. Although the authorities barred several hundred per-
 sons from attending, more than 700 delegates participated in the congress, the larg-
 est gathering held by the NLD since 1990. The authorities permitted several public
 gatherings of NLD members and supporters on various holidays, with little or no
 interference. While the authorities allowed holiday celebrations to take place in
 Aung San Suu Kyi's compound, police restricted the size of the gatherings. The sus-
 pension of restrictions was temporary, however, and subsequent meetings outside
 her compound were blocked. Most universities remained closed, and police prevent
 student demonstrations.
 The Government's mass mobilization organization, the Union Solidarity and De-
 velopment Association (USDA), continued to hold large-scale rallies in support of
 government policies. In many cases it coerced attendance, using implicit or explicit
 threats of penalties for those staying away. There were no reported incidents in
 which the authorities interfered with religious groups' assemblies or other outdoor
 gatherings during the year.
 The Government restricts freedom of association. Aside from officially sanctioned
 organizations like the USDA, the right of association existed only for organizations,
 including trade associations and pro essional bodies, permitted by law and duly reg-
 istered with the Government. Only a handful continue to exist, and even those are
 subject to direct government intervention and take special care to act in accordance
 with government policy. This goup includes apolitical organizations such as the
 Myanmar Red Cross and the Myanmar Medical Association. Only 10 political par-
 ties remained at year's end, compared with 15 in 1992.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-Adherents of all religions duly registered with the au-
 thorities generally enjoyed freedom to worship as they chose; however, the Govern-
 ment imposed some restrictions on certain religious minorities. In recent years,
 Buddhists continued to enjoy a privileged position. The Government has made spe-
 cial efforts to link itself with Buddhism as a means of asserting its own popular le-
 gitimacy. Photographs of SLORC officials paying homage or making donations at
 pagodas throughout the country appear regularly in the official newspaper.
 The Government monitored the activities of members of all religions, in part be-
 cause congregation members have in the past become politically active. The authori-
 ties continued to regard the Muslim and Christian religious minorities with sus-
 icion. Moreover, there is a concentration of Christians among some of the particu-
 ar ethnic minorities against whom the army has fought for decades. Religious pub-
 lications, like secular ones, remained subject to control and censorship. Christian bi-
 bles translated into indigenous languages could not be imported or printed legally,
 although this ban is not enforced in some areas. It remained difficult for Christian
 and Muslim groups to obtain permission to build new churches and mosques. In
 March authorities did little to halt attacks on Muslims by Buddhists monks (see
 Section 5).
 Religious groups of all faiths were able to establish and maintain links with core-
 ligionists in other countries and travel abroad for religious purposes; however, the
 Government reportedly monitored these activities. Foreign religious representatives
 usually were allowed visas only for short stays but in some cases were permitted
 to preach to congregations. Permanent foreign missionary establishments have not
 been permitted since the 1960's, but seven Catholic nuns and four priests working
 in Burma since before independence in 1948 have been allowed to continue their
 work.
 
 
 696
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-Although citizens have the legal right to live anywhere in the country,
 'both urban and rural residents were subject to arbitrary relocation (see Section 1.f.).
 Except for limitations in areas of insurgent activity, citizens could travel freely with-
 in the country but had to notify local authorities of their whereabouts. The Govern-
 ment restricted the freedom of movement of NLD General Secretary Aung San Suu
 Kyi (see Section 2.a.). Those residents unable to meet the restrictive provisions of
 the citizenship law, such as ethnic Chinese, Arakanese, Muslims, and others had
 to obtain prior permission to travel. The Government carefully scrutinized prospec-
 tive travel abroad. This produced rampant corruption as many applicants were
 forced to pat large bribes to obtain passports to which they were otherwise entitled.
 The official oar that reviews passport applications denied passports in some cases
 apparently on political grounds. All college graduates who obtained a passport (ex-
 cept for certain government employees) were required to pay a special education
 clearance fee to reimburse the Government. Citizens who had emigrated legally gen-
 erally were allowed to return to visit relatives, and some who had lived abroad ille-
 gally and acquired foreign citizenship were able to return to visit. The Government
 on occasion restricts the issuance of passports to young female applicants seeking
 work abroad, reportedly to prevent young women from being enticed to travel
 abroad to jobs that are in fact in the commercial sex industry.
 Restrictions on foreign travelers have been eased as part of an effort to promote
 tourism. Burmese embassies issued tourist visas, valid for 1 month, within 24 hours
 of application. However, select categories of applicants, such as foreign human
 rights advocates, journalists, and political figures, continued to be denied entry visas
 unless traveling under the aegis of a sponsor acceptable to the Government, and for
 purposes approved by the Government. Although some areas of the country re-
 mained closed to foreigners for security reasons, the authorities permitted travel to
 most other destinations. Rangoon-based diplomats generally must apply 10 days in
 advance for travel outside the capital.
 At year's end, there were still 21,000 Rohingya Muslims remaining in refugee
 camps in Bangladesh. The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees' (UNHCR's) repa-
 triation program, which since 1992 had succeeded in returning approximately
 238,000 refugees to Burma and had been scheduled to end on August 15, halted pre-
 maturely when the Rohingyas as a group rejected repatriation and demanded reset-
 tlement in Bangladesh. The Rohingyas refused to return because they feared human
 rights abuses, including religious persecution and other government restrictions.
 The UNHCR reported that authorities cooperated in investigating isolated incidents
 of renewed abuse of repatriated citizens. However, returnees complained of restric-
 tions imposed by the Government on their ability to travel and to engage in eco-
 nomic activity.
 A few thousand students and dissidents continued to live in exile in Thailand. The
 more than 100,000 Burmese residing in refugee camps in Thailand were joined dur-
 ing the year by thousands of new arrivals fleeing army attacks against insurgencies
 in the Kan, Karenni and Shan ethnic areas.
 The Government does not allow refugees or displaced persons from abroad to re-
 settle or seek safe haven. The Government has not formulated a policy concerning
 refugees, asylees, or first asylum, and it is not a party to the 1951 U.N. Convention
 Relating to the Status of Refugees or its 1967 protocol.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Despite the overwhelming desire that citizens demonstrated in the 1990 elections
 for a return to democracy, they continued to be denied the right to change their gov-
 ernment. Since 1988 active duty military officers have occupied most importantp-
 sitions throughout the Government,_particularly at the policy making level, but also
 extending to local administration. Despite the appointment of several civilians to
 the Cabinet in 1992, the policy of placing military or recently retired military offi-
 cers in most key senior level positions in all ministries has continued unabated. In
 the SPDC Government formed in November, only 12 of the 41 ministers appointed
 are civilians.
 Following the NLD's victory in the 1990 elections, the SLORC nullified the elec-
 tion results and disqualified, detained, arrested, or drove into exile many successful
 candidates. Since then, 236 of the 392 NLD deputies elected have either been dis-
 qualified, resigned under pressure, gone into exile, been detained, or died. Approxi-
 mately 31 successful candidates from the election remain in prison.
 Rather than accept the will of the citizenry as expressed in the 1990 election, the
 SLORC convened a National Convention in January 1993 to draw up principles for
 a new constitution. The SLORC hand-picked most delegates, and carefully stage-
 
 
 697
 managed the proceedings; even limited opposition views were ignored, The SLORC
 tasked the Convention with drafting a new constitution designed to provide a domi-
 nant role for the military services in the country's future political structure. In No-
 vember 1995, the NLD delegates withdrew from the Convention pending agreement
 by the authorities to discuss revising the Convention's working procedures to permit
 debate and meaningful participation in formulation of a new constitution. Two days
 after its withdrawal the NLD was formally expelled. The National Convention con-
 tinued its deliberations until it adjourned in March 1996. It has not reconvened. The
 provisions that it adopted were designed to ensure the large-scale involvement of
 the military services in all levels of government-including reserving 25 percent of
 seats in the Parliament to appointed members of the military services, and reserv-
 ing key government posts for military personnel as well. In addition, it adopted pro-
 visions that prohibited, among other things, anyone "under acknowledgment of alle-
 giance" to a foreigner or who has received any type of assistance from a foreign
 source, from participating in the Government. These provisions were apparently cle-
 signed to exclude Aung San Suu Kyi, who is married to an Englishman and who
 won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1991.
 Women and minorities are underrepresented in the top ranks of government serv-
 ices and excluded from military leadership. Members of certain minority groups con-
 tinue to be denied full citizenship (see Section 5).
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The Government does not allow domestic human rights organizations to exist, and
 it remained generally hostile to outside scrutiny of its human rights record. Dis-
 turbed by the severe criticism contained in 1995 resolutions adopted by the U.N.
 Human Rights Commission (UNHRC), the authorities refused to meet with UNHRC
 representatives during the year. In his February report to the UNHRC, Special
 Rapporteur for Burma, Rajsoomer Lallah, who was repeatedly denied entry into the
 country, criticized the human rights violations committed agalnst ethnic minorities
 as a result of the SLORC's policy of forcible relocations and continued recourse to
 forced labor and citizens' forced labor as porters.
 Approximately 14 nonpolitical, humanitarian, international NGO's continued
 project work. A few others established a provisional presence while undertaking the
 protracted negotiations necessary to set up permanent operations in the country.
 The International Committee of the Red Cross was unable to negotiate its return
 after closing its office in 1995.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Government continued to rule by decree and was not bound by any constitu-
 tional provisions concerning discrimination.
 Women.-Violence against women, including spousal abuse, is infrequent. Married
 couples often live in households with extended families, where social pressure tends
 to   tect the wife from abuse. Trafficking in women and girls remains a serious
 pro lem.
 There were reliable reports that many women and children in border areas, where
 the Government's control is limited, were forced or lured into working as prostitutes
 in Thailand. It is unknown how many young women have been induced or coerced
 into working as prostitutes, but a common practice is to lure young women to Thai-
 land with promises of employment as a waitress or domestic servant. The military
 forces continued to impress women for military porterage duties, and there were
 many reports of rape of ethnic minority women by soldiers (see Sections 1.c. and
 In general women have traditionally enjoyed a high status, exercising most of the
 same basic rights as men and taking an active role in business. Consistent with tra-
 ditional culture, women keep their names after marriage and often control family
 fimances. However, women remained underrepresented in most traditional male oc-
 cupations, and a few professions continued to be effectively barred to women. The
 burden of poverty, which is particularly widespread in rural areas, fell dispropor-
 tionately on women. The Government restricts foreign travel by young women (see
 Section 2.d.).
 Women did not consistently receive equal pay for equal work. There were no inde-
 pendent women's rights organizations, and no government ministry was specifically
 charged with safeguarding women's interests. The Myanmar Maternal and Child
 Welfare Association, a government-controlled a encprovided assistance to moth-
 ers. A professional society for businesswomen, te Myanmar Women Entrepreneurs'
 Association, formed in 1995, provided loans to new businesses. A government-con-
 
 
 698
 trolled agency, the All Myanmar Women's Affairs Committee, signed an inter-
 national convention to eliminate discrimination against women.
 Children.-Despite various child welfare programs, the Government allocated few
 resources to programs for children. According to government studies conducted with
 U.N. assistance, although education is compulsory, 65 to 75 percent of children do
 not finish primary school, and only 5 percent complete secondary school.
 Child prostitution of young females, especially those from the ethnic minority
 Shan state sent or luredto Thailand, continued to be a major problem. The rising
 incidence of HIV infection has increased the demand for supposedly "safer" younger
 prostitutes.
 Religious Minorities.-Anti-Muslim violence erupted in March. Buddhist monks
 attacked Muslims and their property in Mandalay, and the attacks spread to other
 cities including Rangoon. Monks in Mandalay and Rangoon ransacked mosques,
 businesses, and homes of Muslims, and the authorities did little to prevent such at-
 tacks. Authorities reportedly killed one monk in Mandalay while the authorities
 were dispersing rioters.
 People With Disabilities.-Official assistance to persons with disabilities is ex-
 tremely limited. There is no law mandating accessibility to buildings, public trans-
 portation, or government facilities. While there are several small-scale organizations
 to assist the disabled, most disabled persons must rely on their families to provide
 for their welfare. Disabled veterans receive available benefits on a priority basis. Be-
 cause of land mine detonations, Burma has a very high rate of amputee injuries.
 National RacillEthnic Minorities.-Burma's myriad ethnic minorities have long
 - resented the dominance of the country's Burman majority. The minorities have been
 largely excluded from the military leadership. In recent years, the SLORC has
 sought to pacify these ethnic groups by means of negotiated cease-fires, grants of
 limited autonomy, and -promises of development assistance.
 The Government included a large number of ethnic minority representatives in
 the National Convention and permitted extended debate on the issue of minority au-
 tonomy. However, the ethnic minority populations continue to complain that their
 concerns have not been addressed adequately by the Government. Economic devel-
 opment among minorities has continued to lag, leaving many persons living at bare-
 ly subsistence levels.
 Since the focus of hostilities against armed insurgencies has been in the border
 areas where most minorities are concentrated, those populations have been dis-
 proportionately victimized by the general violence associated with the military
 forces' activities. Even in areas pacified under cease-fire arrangements, forced labor,
 village relocations, and other infringements on the rights of ethnic minorities con-
 tinue to be imposed by local army commanders.
 Since only people who can prove long familial links to Burma are accorded full
 citizenship, ethnic populations, such as Muslims, Indians, and Chinese, continued
 to be demed full citizenship and are excluded from government positions. Persons
 without full citizenship are not free to travel domestically and are barred from cer-
 tain advanced university programs in medicine and technological fields (see Section
 2.d.). Anti-Chinese and anti-Muslim sentiment remained widespread.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Free trade unions do not exist, and even former gov-
 ernment-controlled ones were dormant. Strikes are rare; however, in December,
 workers in a foreign-owned textile factory in Pegu staged a successful 4-day strike.
 Following the intervention of the Department of Labor, workers and management
 reached a compromise that included higher wages and improved working conditions.
 In July 1989, the United States suspended Burma's eligibility for trade concessions
 under the Generalized System of Preferences program, pending steps to afford its
 labor force internationally recognized worker rights.
 Because of its longstanding violation of International Labor Organization (ILO)
 Convention 87 on Freedom of Association, Burma was again cited for noncompliance
 by the June 1997 ILO Conference which characterized the situation as "particularly
 grave."
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Workers do not have the
 right to organize and bargain collectively to set wages and benefits. The Govern-
 ment's Central Arbitration Board, which theoretically provides a means for settling
 major labor disputes, continued to exist but in practice was dormant. Township-level
 labor supervisory committees exist to address minor labor concerns.
 The Government unilaterally sets wages in the public sector. In the private sector,
 wages are set by market forces. The Government pressures joint ventures not to pay
 salaries greater than those of ministers or other senior employees. Some joint ven-
 tures circumvent this with supplemental pay, including remuneration paid in for-
 
 
 699
 eisa exchange certificates, as well as through incentive and overtime pay and other
 fringe benefits. Foreign firms generally set wages near those of the domestic private
 sector but follow the example of joint ventures in awarding supplemental wages and
 benefits.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced or compulsory labor re-
 mains a serious problem. In March following an investigation of the country's forced
 labor practices, the European Union Commission revoked benefits under the Gener-
 alized System of Preferences. In recent years, the SLORC has increasingly supple-
 mented declining gross investment with uncompensated people's "contributions,"
 chiefly of forced labor, to build or maintain irrigation, transportation and tourism
 infrastructure projects. During 1996 the Government introduced an initiative to use
 military personnel for infrastructure projects. This initiative and the increasing use
 of heavy construction equipment resulted in a decline during 1996-1997 in the use
 of unpaid labor on physical infrastructure projects, especially for irrigation prMjects
 and railroad building. Nonetheless, there were credible reports that the use of forced
 labor remained widespread throughout the country.
 The army continued to force citizens-including women and children-to work as
 porters, which led to mistreatment, illness, and death in military actions against
 ethnic insurgents (see Sections L.a., 1.c., and 1.g.). The Government does not specifi-
 cally prohibit forced and bonded labor by children. While bonded labor is practiced,
 forced labor occurs in military porterage and in situations in which a family or
 household is required to contribute labor to a particular project, and the children
 are called upon by parents to help fulfill that obligation, without opposition by the
 Government.
 In March the governing board of the ILO established a Commission of Inquiry to
 investigate Burma for its violation of ILO Convention 29 on forced labor. The com-
 plaint accuses the Government of the systematic use of forced labor.
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment.-Although
 the law sets a minimum age of 13 for the employment of children, in practice the
 law is not enforced. Working children are highly visible in cities, mostly working
 for small or family enterprises, and in family agricultural activities in the country-
 side. Children are hired at lower pay rates than adults for the same kind of work.
 Arts and crafts is the only sector producing for the export market that employs a
 significant number of children. Despite a compulsory education law, almost 40 per-
 cent of children never enroll in school, and only 25 to 35 percent complete the 5-
 year primary school course. The Government does not specifically prohibit forced
 and bonded labor by children. While bonded labor is not practiced, forced labor by
 children occurs (see section 6.c.).
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-Surplus labor conditions and lack of protection
 by government authorities continue to dictate substandard conditions for workers,
 despite recent annual economic growth of at least 5 percent. The Law on Fundamen-
 tal Workers Rights of 1964 and the Factories Act of 1951 regulate working condi-
 tions. There is a legally prescribed 5-day, 35-hour workweek for employees in the
 public sector and a 6-day, 44-hour workweek for private and state enterprise em-
 ployees, with overtime paid for additional work. The law also allows for a 24-hour
 rest period per week, and workers have 21 paid holidays a year. Such provisions
 actually affect only a small portion of the country's labor force.
 Only government employees and employees of a few traditional industries are cov-
 ered by minimum wage provisions. The minimum monthly wage for salaried public
 employees is $2.50 (600 kyats). This sum is supplemented by various subsidies and
 allowances. The minimum wage does not provide a worker with a decent standard
 of living. The low level of pay in public employment fosters widespread corruption.
 The government minimum wage for day labor is $0.08 (20 kyats). Workers in the
 private sector are much better paid. The actual average wage rate for casual labor-
 ers in Rangoon in 1997 was ten times the official mimmum. Wage increases contin-
 ued to lag far behind inflation.
 Numerous health and safety regulations exist, but in practice the Government has
 not made the necessary resources available to enforce the regulations, although
 workers may in principle remove themselves from hazardous conditions, in practice
 workers cannot expect to retain their jobs if they do so.
