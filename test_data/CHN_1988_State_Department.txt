 CHINA
 The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) rules the People's Republic
 of China (PRC). A small group of leaders exercise ultimate
 power within the party through their positions in several key
 organizations, including the 17-member Politburo, its 5-member
 Standing Committee, and the party's Central Military
 Commission. Deng Xiaoping, the Chairman of the Central
 Military Commission, is China's preeminent leader. Since
 achieving power in 1949, the CCP has continued China's long
 tradition of authoritarian rule. The CCP justifies its
 leading role by invoking Marxist-Leninist ideology.
 The CCP and the Government maintain control through a large
 state security and legal apparatus--which includes the
 Ministry of State Security, the Ministry of Public Security,
 and state judicial, procuratorial, and penal systems--and
 through traditional societal pressure.
 As modernization of China's economy has progressed, the
 leadership has repudiated much of the centralized Soviet
 economic model, the basis on which it originally structured
 China's socialist economy. Without changing the fundamental
 Socialist orientation of the economy or of the government,
 individual and small collective enterprises have been allowed
 more leeway to operate, and many small state-owned enterprises
 and stores have been contracted out to individuals. In the
 countryside, where 80 percent of the population lives, the
 rural commune system has been eliminated, and peasants now
 farm land leased from the Government under individually held
 contracts.
 There has been a limited relaxation under way for a decade in
 the context of China's overall reform program. Political
 reform has to some extent reduced the role of the party in
 government and the everyday lives of Chinese.' The relaxation
 in the political atmosphere has made it easier for people to
 express a variety of opinions on government and party policies
 as long as they do not question the foundations of party
 rule. The legal system, abandoned during the Cultural
 Revolution, is being resurrected and strengthened, but it will
 require many years to rebuild effective legal institutions.
 During 1988 there was some improvement in the human rights
 situation in China but also some important setbacks. While
 China's authoritarian structure remains in place, there is
 reason to expect that this liberalizing trend will continue,
 albeit in fits and starts, in the coming years. The PRC,
 however, continues to place important restrictions on basic
 political and civil rights. In growing numbers, students,
 academicians, and intellectuals have demanded democratization
 of the system in recent years. However, the Government still
 does not tolerate fundamenta-l criticism of the CCP, the
 Socialist system, or the leadership. In the past, dissidents,
 such as those calling for democratization of the system, have
 been dealt with harshly. Charged with "counterrevolutionary"
 offenses, they were frequently imprisoned for long periods of
 time or sentenced to "reform through labor." Today retribution
 is usually more subtle, often involving loss of party
 membership and its accompanying perquisites, refusal of
 permission to travel abroad or to publish, and damage to
 professional careers.
 Periodic setbacks in the human rights situation serve to
 highlight the limits on the rate and scope of liberalization.

 CHINA
 Prominent among them was the violent suppression in late 1987,
 March 1988, and December 1988 of demonstrations in Tibet.
 These demonstrations underscored the continuing Tibetan
 resentment of Han Chinese economic and political dominance.
 Faced with a population of 1.08 billion, mostly concentrated
 in some 20 percent of China's territory in the eastern
 provinces, the Government maintains an extensive family
 planning program. The program encourages families to have
 only one child, but provides for some exceptions. The
 implementation of this policy varies widely. Government
 officials state that regulations calling for prosecution of
 those using coercive measures have been successfully
 implemented. A resurgence in birth rates in the past 3 years
 suggests coercion may indeed have decreased. Current
 government policy is to rely on a combination of strong
 economic and social pressures and economic incentives and
 penalties to encourage small families rather than on more
 direct coercion. However, with China's vast rural population
 (over 70 percent of the total), control measures have been
 increasingly ineffective because of decentralization of
 authority, broadened prosperity, and flexibility in policy
 implementation at the local level.
 The general trend toward greater toleration of officially
 approved religious activities continued. The number of
 churches, monasteries, and mosques conducting religious
 services has increased, as has the availability of religious
 training and literature. Nevertheless, the authorities
 continue to suppress unofficial religious institutions and
 control ties to foreign religious organizations. In Tibet,
 government controls on the activities of monks and monasteries
 were among the factors which led to protests.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 No government-sanctioned, politically motivated killings are
 known to have occurred in 1988. However, the Chinese forcibly
 suppressed demonstrations in the Tibetan Autonomous Region
 (TAR) that occurred in late 1987, and in March and December
 1988. Chinese officials have confirmed that five people died
 during the large-scale riot of March 5, including one Han
 Chinese police officer. Reportedly at least one monk was
 killed by Chinese security forces during the December 10
 demonstration, when public security personnel resorted to use
 of firearms in quelling actions by unarmed demonstrators.
 b. Disappearance
 Mr. Xu Yongze, an itinerant Christian evangelist, was reported
 to have disappeared after being detained by security officials
 in April, and regular inquiries about him have been made by a
 number of organizations and persons. Chinese officials have
 denied Xu's arrest, but according to Hong Kong sources Xu is
 imprisoned at an unknown location. There were no other
 confirmed reports of persons being abducted or disappearing at
 the hands of the security services.
 
 
 765
 CHINA
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 China's Code of Criminal Procedure specifically prohibits the
 use of torture. In December 1986, China signed the 1984
 United Nations Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel,
 Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment. The Standing Committee of
 the National People's Congress ratified the Convention in
 September 1988. According to official statistics, in the
 first 6 months of 1988, procuratorial organs handled a total
 of 7,000 legal-disciplinary cases. Eleven percent of these
 cases dealt with violations of human rights, such as illegal
 detention and forced confessions. A further breakdown of
 these statistics was unavailable. News reports of occasional
 use of torture or physical punishment by officials persist.
 The Government continues to publicize and condemn cases of
 such activity and to take action against the perpetrators.
 For example, the July 18 issue of the Legal Daily reported
 that a public security officer in Henan province was tried and
 sentenced to life imprisonment for the death by beating of a
 detainee under interrogation. In an unsubstantiated report,
 five African students allege that they were tortured during
 interrogation by police following their involvement in a
 confrontation between African students and Chinese students
 and university employees in Nanjing on December 24.
 The authorities sometimes subject persons convicted of serious
 crimes to public denunciation and humiliation at "mass
 sentencing rallies." At these rallies, sometimes attended by
 thousands of people (including the families and neighbors of
 the convicted persons), the accused are denounced and their
 sentences revealed to the crowd. Such "mass sentencing
 rallies" continued to occur in 1988.
 A July 1980 central government order reportedly banned the
 practice of humiliating criminals by parading them through the
 streets. Nonetheless, there was at least one such occurrence
 in 1988. Public executions ostensibly ended with the
 promulgation of the Law of Criminal Procedure in January 1980.
 Little information generally is available about conditions
 inside Chinese prisons. As a result of the detention and
 later release of a number of Tibetan demonstrators in 1987-88,
 some examples of abuse by police and prison officials have
 been reported. Reports vary on the occurrence and severity of
 beatings and other forms of torture or ill-treatment in prisons
 in Tibet. Credible reports, however, suggest that beatings
 and other forms of mistreatment, including the use of electric
 prods, were common among those detained following protests in
 Tibet. These reports are similar to periodic fragmentary
 accounts of alleged treatment of several political dissidents
 jailed since the early 1980's for political activism related
 to Beijing's "Democracy Wall." TAR officials deny that Tibetan
 prisoners are tortured or otherwise mistreated and have
 specifically denied the use of electric prods. However,
 officials have been sparing in their release of information on
 actual conditions within prisons. TAR officials refused a
 September request by the U.S. Consulate General in Chengdu to
 visit a Tibetan prison. Neither have officials responded to
 an August request by a visiting U.S. Senator for information
 on conditions in Tibetan prisons and on the status of
 individual prisoners named in a list passed to TAR officials
 again in October.

 CHINA
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The Criminal Procedure Code proscribes arbitrary arrest or
 detention. According to the law, interrogation should take
 place within 24 hours of detention and the detainee's family
 or work unit should be informed of the reasons therefore and
 the place of detention. The Public Security Bureau must submit
 a request for formal arrest to a procuratorate within 3 days of
 detention. This period may be extended by 1 to 4 days "under
 certain circumstances." The procuratorate must approve the
 application for arrest or have the detainee released within 3
 days of its submission. A detainee may therefore be held for
 up to 10 days prior to formal arrest.
 In July'1984, the NPC Standing Committee approved amendments
 extending the period of detention during investigation after
 formal arrest from 2 to 4 months and the time limit for trials
 from 1 1/2 to 2 1/2 months. These changes are supposed to
 apply only to "serious" cases and require that extensions be
 approved by provincial procuratorates or courts. The 1984
 regulations also authorized the use of bail for accused persons
 not considered "dangerous," but to date no reports of its
 implementation are available.
 Court and procuracy officials are supposed to be held
 accountable if these time limits are violated, and Chinese
 officials and the press frequently call for the strict
 enforcement of these provisions of the code. There have been
 press reports of officials being charged and sentenced for
 illegal detention of persons. Nevertheless, people continue to
 be detained for long periods of time without being charged or
 told of the reasons for their detention. For example, Yang
 Wei, a former student in the United States, was held in
 detention for 11 months, apparently without being charged
 formally, before being brought to trial in late 1987.
 Apparently most of those detained for participation in
 demonstrations in Lhasa have also been held for periods
 varying from days to months without being formally charged.
 Incommunicado detention of criminal suspects occurs. The
 provision of the law requiring notification to families or
 work units when a person is detained (Article 43, Law of
 Criminal Procedure) is ignored frequently.
 Under "labor education" provisions, those who commit minor
 theft or fraud or who have been expelled from their work units
 may be deprived of their civil liberties and subjected to 1 to
 4 years of "reform" without trial. "Reform" includes
 ideological indoctrination, academic instruction, vocational
 training, and compulsory labor. This nonjudicial sentencing
 procedure has been used frequently against political
 dissidents. Judgments are handed down by a public security
 office in consultation with representatives of local civil
 affairs units.
 "Reform through labor" is a court sentence imposed on those
 accused of more serious crimes than those which come under
 "education through labor" provisions. Persons may be
 sentenced to up to 15 years of "reform through labor."
 Offenders from prisons in coastal areas are often transferred
 to labor camps in remote areas of Xinjiang and Qinghai in
 China's far west. Even after they complete their sentences,
 prisoners may be denied permission to return to their homes in
 eastern China. In what amounts to a form of internal exile,
 they are assigned jobs and become permanent residents of these
 
 
 CHINA
 underpopulated regions. A U.S. Embassy request to visit a
 prison or labor camp in Qinghai in the fall of 1987 was denied.
 In addition, there are several forms of administrative
 detention. As noted in Amnesty International's (AI) 1987
 report "China: Torture and Ill-Treatment of Prisoners,"
 people may be detained for up to 15 days for minor public
 order offenses. Another form of administrative detention
 imposed by the police is "shelter and investigation."
 Although the AI report cites 3 months as the maximum period
 for this type of detention, officials have said that there is
 no statutory time limit. Officials confirm AI's contention
 that those subject to this type of detention are people who
 commit minor offenses or whose identity, address, or background
 is unclear.
 Credible reports from Lhasa indicate that in some cases
 Tibetans, including family members and fellow monks, have been
 denied permission to visit detainees. These reports also
 indicate that information on the welfare of the detainees has
 sometimes been withheld. Widespread uncertainty over the
 number of prisoners, their identities, and their physical
 condition adds credibility to these claims, as do similar
 reports elsewhere in China that prisoners--particularly those
 suspected of politically related offenses--are sometimes held
 without due process or notification of families.
 With regard to forced or compulsory labor, see Section 6.c.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 China's judiciary in practice follows CCP policy. Political-
 legal committees composed of party and government legal figures
 exist at all levels of government separately from the court
 system. These committees are responsible for enforcing party
 interests in important criminal cases. There are currently no
 standing special political or security courts.
 Courts generally assume that any person brought to trial is
 guilty. Most Chinese trials are essentially sentencing
 hearings at which defense representatives plead for clemency
 for their clients and, with few exceptions, do not contest
 their guilt. Trials are preceded by extensive pretrial
 investigation carried out by the Public Security Bureau and
 the procurator. The law guarantees the right to counsel;
 however, a defense attorney normally does not enter a case
 until just prior to trial, which could be months after formal
 charges are brought. Throughout 1988 lawyers and legal
 scholars publicly debated the need to allow defense lawyers to
 enter cases earlier, but no official measures have been taken
 to petmit this.
 There have been instances where accused persons have
 successfully defended their innocence and been released,
 although this occurs in less than 2 percent of cases,
 according to one report. Defendants in criminal cases may
 appeal both verdicts and sentences to the next higher court;
 in doing so defendants run the risk that their sentences may
 be increased as well as decreased.
 The Criminal Procedure Code requires that all trials be held
 in public, except those involving state secrets, juveniles, and
 "personal secrets." In practice, attendance at public trials
 requires an admission ticket obtained from organizations
 selected by the authorities, and foreigners are often barred.
 
 
 768
 CHINA
 In the Yang Wei case, the tickets were reportedly limited to
 cadres and university administrators rather than students or
 other colleagues. Yang's parents were allowed to attend the
 trial, but foreign observers were not.
 Some courts may be more open to the press in the future. A
 June 13 Legal Daily article announced that Beijing courts will
 allow the press to cover and report on criminal cases from
 arrest through investigation to trial and sentencing, except
 those involving state secrets and personal secrets.
 No reliable figures exist for the number of political
 prisoners in China. Insufficient data make an accurate
 estimate impossible. The Government denies that it has any
 political prisoners and insists that it imprisons only
 criminals and "counterrevolutionaries." The Criminal Code
 considers such crimes as espionage, subversion, and
 "propagandizing for and inciting the overthrow of the ...
 Socialist system" as counterrevolutionary. According to
 Government sources, "counterrevolutionary" offenses are said
 to constitute about 1 to 3 percent of the number of criminal
 offenses. Wei Jingshen is currently serving a 15-year
 sentence following conviction for "counterrevolutionary"
 crimes committed in connection with "Democracy Wall" in 1979.
 The total inmate population in labor camps and prisons may
 have increased since a 1983 anticrime campaign, in view of a
 report that by the end of 1986 over 1 million people had been
 sentenced as a result of the crackdown. Partial figures
 obtained in 1986 suggest a total prison/labor camp population
 of between 2 and 5 million.
 Estimates of the total number of detainees and prisoners held
 in Tibetan prisons as a result of the 1987 and early 1988
 demonstrations range from unofficial reports of between 75 and
 100 and official reports of 13 to 26.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Personal and family life are extensively regulated in China.
 For many Chinese, particularly among the 20 percent of the
 population who are urban residents, life revolves around the
 work unit, which not only provides employment, but also often
 controls housing, ration coupons, permission to marry and have
 a child, and other aspects of ordinary life. The work unit,
 along with personnel in neighborhood committees, monitors a
 person's attitude and behavior. The unit implements party
 policies at the local level, but its considerable autonomy may
 also be used to ignore or obstruct directives from the top.
 Recent economic reforms and a central policy of relaxing
 social controls have weakened the unit's interference in many
 aspects of daily life. In rural areas, the shift to family
 farming from collective farming, for example, has markedly
 decreased opportunities for interference in personal lives by
 local officials.
 Chinese leaders in the 1970's concluded that it was important
 to limit the growth of China's population. A comprehensive
 family planning program was initiated and, according to the
 State Statistical Bureau, 104 million fewer babies were born
 in China between 1978 and 1987 than would have been born
 without the program.
 
 
 769
 CHINA
 The national policy, with some exceptions, calls for families
 to have only one child. Throughout the country, regulations
 for implementing the national family planning policy are set
 by local governments; there is significant variation in the
 way the program is implemented from province to province and
 often even within a given province. Although national policy
 calls for one child per family, nearly one out of two children
 (48.3 percent) born in 1987 was a second birth, 31.5 percent
 were third births, and 16.8 percent were fourth births.
 The national policy of one-child families has been directed
 primarily at Han Chinese who make up about 92 percent of
 China's population, and central guidelines have been followed
 more vigorously in urban areas than in rural areas.
 Increasingly, provincial authorities have expanded the grounds
 for waiving the one-child rule, ranging from the birth of a
 handicapped baby and parental employment in particularly
 hazardous and undesirable occupations to the birth of a girl
 as a firstborn in many rural areas.
 In 1988 national authorities announced that the family
 planning policy would be extended to some minority areas as
 well as Han areas. Most minorities, however, continue to
 enjoy more liberal treatment with respect to family size.
 Family planning appears to have been largely ignored among
 minorities in Xinjiang, Qinghai, and Gansu where large
 families are the norm.
 Couples who sign a pledge to have only one child receive a
 number of incentives, often including free health care for the
 child; a 5 percent increase in their pensions; priority in
 housing, schooling, and medical treatment; and a monthly bonus
 of about $2.00.
 Couples who insist on having a second child have the right to
 do so in principle. However, in addition to losing their
 eligibility for monthly bonuses, they may be required to pay
 fines, repay money already received and, in some instances,
 give up or return other benefits as well. Economic pressure
 on families who already have two children and then have more
 may be severe, and may include the loss of Communist Party
 membership, loss of job, difficulty in purchasing state-
 supplied seed, fertilizer and fuel, and other sanctions.
 Sometimes private property is attached or confiscated for
 failure to pay fines. The rise in rural incomes accompanying
 economic reforms has, however, reduced peasant responsiveness
 to economic sanctions. Moreover, employment in small
 collective or individual enterprises has further weakened the
 ability of government agencies to enforce regulations.
 In the past, contrary to announced central government policy,
 there were reports of some local officials coercing women who
 became pregnant without permission into having abortions. In
 1988 the Government stressed repeatedly that it does not
 condone forced abortions or sterilizations. Chinese
 authorities have said that they take measures against local
 officials who violate government policy in this regard. In
 November 1988, Gansu province passed a law prohibiting
 mentally retarded persons from bearing children, mandating
 sterilization of such persons before they can receive a
 marriage license, and requiring termination of any pregnancy
 of a mentally retarded woman.
 Contacts between Chinese and foreigners have increased
 considerably in recent years. Whereas Chinese citizens whose
 
 
 770
 CHINA
 work did not require or permit contact with foreigners have in
 the past been warned or detained and questioned if they
 persisted in meeting foreign acquaintances, such instances
 appear to be much rarer than in the past. "English corners,"
 where Chinese and foreigners can meet to talk in English,
 attract large numbers of people. Meetings with officials by
 official and unofficial Americans which were difficult to
 arrange only a few years ago are now more routine.
 The Criminal Procedure Code requires the use of search
 warrants for gathering evidence, and they have been presented
 in a number of cases involving foreigners. No-reliable
 information exists as to how strictly this provision is
 implemented among the general population. The Code allows the
 authorities wide latitude. If an "emergency situation"
 develops when the authorities are carrying out arrest or
 detention, they have the right to enter and search living
 premises without warrants or notification. Several years ago,
 there were credible reports of the use of electronic
 eavesdropping equipment to monitor suspected political
 dissidents. There is no evidence to suggest that the
 authorities have ceased using such measures.
 In December 1986, the NPC passed China's first postal service
 law guaranteeing privacy in written communication and
 prohibiting tampering with mail except as permitted by law
 (i.e., as noted in Section 5, Article 86 of the Criminal
 Procedure Code, investigative personnel of the public security
 organs or the procuracy are empowered to authorize the seizure
 of mail or telegrams).
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Although one clause in the Constitution provides for freedom
 of speech and of the press, the preamble prohibits criticism
 of the CCP or socialism. Although restrictions on freedom of
 speech and of the press have been relaxed to some degree in
 recent years, tolerance of political criticism on sensitive
 subjects, such as leadership corruption or fundamental policy
 direction on noneconomic subjects, remains limited. Occasional
 repressive campaigns, such as the antispiritual pollution
 campaign of 1983 and the antibourgeois liberalization campaign
 of early 1987, strongly discourage free expression.
 Many authors, especially those persecuted in past political
 movements, practice self-censorship. Penalties for breaching
 unwritten rules of acceptability include public criticism in
 journals and newspapers. Editors of journals or other
 publications may face dismissal. Several newspapers accused
 of political infractions during the 1987 antibourgeois
 liberalization campaign experienced party criticism and
 closure. Party members who do not abide by the strictures on
 criticism of the party may be expelled.
 The antibourgeois liberalization campaign followed late 1986
 demonstrations, in which students called for political reform
 and democratization. Party actions included expelling at least
 three prominent intellectuals from the CCP. An ideological
 chill, which limited freedom of expression in cultural and
 intellectual circles, was evident through the winter and part
 of the spring of 1987. Authorities reportedly prevented a
 variety of cultural events from opening.
 
 
 771
 CHINA
 Even though the party took disciplinary action against five
 intellectuals in the summer of 1987, the atmosphere prior to
 and during the 13th Party Congress in October of that year
 indicated a more relaxed political environment with regard to
 freedom of speech and the press. Party General Secretary Zhao
 Ziyang, in his opening speech to the Congress, said that the
 Government should "put an end to abuses of rights and freedoms"
 and enact laws governing the press and publications,
 association and assembly, and practice of religion.
 Discussion and drafting of these proposed laws was well
 underway by the end of 1988.
 The seventh session of the National People's Congress (NPC),
 held in the spring of 1988, demonstrated the party's
 willingness after the 13th Party Congress to experiment with
 limited openness and tolerance of criticism from the outside.
 Domestic and foreign journalists were allowed to cover major
 segments of the NPC. Delegates elected some NPC leaders from
 multicandidate slates for the first time. Delegates voiced
 strong criticism of party and government economic and education
 policies. They also condemned growing official corruption.
 Chinese press and television later replayed some of the
 delegates' statements.
 Two months later, threatened student demonstrations in Beijing
 demonstrated the continued existence of limits on the
 expression of political views. In early June, Beijing
 University students posted "big character posters" on campus
 lampooning the party and threatened to demonstrate for
 democracy in the center of Beijing. Authorities quickly
 warned students of the negative consequences of this and threw
 a police cordon around the area wher  students intended to
 gather. Planned demonstrations fizzled, and the public
 expression of student discontent rapidly subsided.
 The leadership has permitted greater, albeit still limited,
 access to various aspects of foreign culture. Foreign books
 and artistic works are still screened by authorities, but more
 are available now than in past years.
 Foreign films are shown more frequently on television and in
 theaters, and visits by foreign artistic groups are more
 common. Selected subscribers in universities and other
 institutions receive foreign periodicals. Tens of millions of
 Chinese read "The Reference News", an officially published
 selection of translations from the foreign press that is
 circulated privately within China.
 Coverage of foreign news in the open media has become more
 extensive and professional. Chinese listen freely to foreign
 broadcasts, and many universities use the Voice of America and
 other foreign radio broadcasts in their language courses. In
 its weekly programming, Chinese television includes some
 programs from Western and other countries.
 Recent government action with regard to foreign press activity
 in China has been contradictory. The 13th Party Congress in
 late 1987 and the seventh NPC were the first large party and
 government convocations partially open to foreign journalists.
 No foreign journalists have been expelled from China since
 early 1987, but one was denied entry in 1988. After initially
 allowing foreign journalists into Tibet to cover the
 demonstrations in Lhasa in late 1987, the TAR Government
 ordered them out. While a few have been permitted to return,
 the Government has strictly enforced rules requiring
 
 
 772
 CHINA
 application for entry 10 days in advance and has otherwise
 obstructed easy journalistic access.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Constitution provides for freedom of peaceful assembly and
 association, but these are strictly regulated in practice. In
 December 1986, the Beijing municipal government enacted new
 regulations circumscribing residents' rights to participate in
 marches and demonstrations by requiring application in advance
 and proscribing certain areas. Shanghai, Xinjiang, and other
 areas enacted similar regulations in 1988.
 Lhasa enacted regulations restricting assembly in 1987.
 Chinese officials contend that some Tibetans who participated
 in Lhasa demonstrations killed or wounded police officers and
 many advocated Tibetan independence. Authorities consider such
 advocacy illegal and, since October 1987, at least one Tibetan
 who allegedly supports independence has been detained and
 charged with the crime of "spreading reactionary propaganda
 and agitation." A TAR official recently told a visiting U.S.
 Senator that many of the monks and lay people who participated
 in the demonstrations not only engaged in shouting "splittist"
 slogans but also took part in beating, looting, and destroying
 public property. Lhasa residents have told visitors that the
 Tibetan riots spread into Han Chinese business areas of Lhasa,
 where shops and people were attacked. However, many people
 who were detained and punished apparently did nothing more
 than demonstrate and shout slogans.
 China has a wide variety and increasing number of professional
 and-other mass associations, such as the All-China Youth
 Federation, the All-China Women's Federation, the Chinese
 Writers' Association, the All-China Sports Federation, and
 various official religious organizations. These groups are
 under party control. The authorities attempt to suppress or
 coopt groups which attempt to function independently.
 For a discussion of freedom of association as it applies to
 labor unions, see Section 6.a.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Reversing the attempts during the Cultural Revolution era to
 eliminate all religious practice, China's leadership initiated
 a policy of limited religious toleration in 1978. According
 to official statements, the Government's current policy towards
 religion rests on the assumption that "it will take patient,
 meticulous, and repeated education over a long period of time
 to weaken religion's influence. Religion cannot be completely
 abolished until the future, upon the attainment of a certain
 state in the development of Communist society."
 The Constitution affirms freedom of religious belief, and
 specifies that no organization or person may compel citizens
 to believe or disbelieve in religion or discriminate against
 them because of religious preference. The Constitution also
 provides that religious bodies must not be subject to foreign
 domination. In the past, this provision has been directed at
 the Catholic Church, but following the disturbances in Lhasa
 the Chinese authorities have acted to combat the Dalai Lama's
 influence on the Tibetan Buddhist community. In addition to
 these provisions, official policy forbids religious
 proselytizing other than at places of worship or believers'
 homes. The Government seeks to prevent the conversion of those
 
 
 773
 CHINA
 under 18 years of age. Government officials while
 acknowledging that this is current policy, assert that the
 policy is only loosely implemented and there are no known
 instances in which this concern has led to pressure on families
 not to teach religion to their children.
 The authorities have required all religious bodies to affiliate
 with eight national organizations representing Christianity,
 Buddhism, Islam, and Daoism. Five of these are Christian
 associations: two Protestant and three Catholic. Together,
 these five Christian associations, with different functional
 responsibilities but overlapping leaderships, constitute the
 officially sanctioned national Protestant and Catholic
 Churches. These five Christian associations and the three
 organizations representing the other religions exist to ensure
 that religious bodies accept the leadership of the State and
 party.
 Although the Government required all Protestant denominations
 to merge in the 1950's, congregations and individuals may
 follow preferences on such matters as forms of baptism. Since
 its separation from Rome 30 years ago, the Chinese Catholic
 Church has developed its own theology and doctrines. For
 example, it rejects papal infallibility and supremacy,
 continues to conduct services in Latin, and supports the
 state's policy on birth control, provided church-approved
 methods are used.
 Religious activities have expanded considerably in recent years
 and appear to have been noticeably strengthened in the last 3
 years. Many religious institutions which closed during the
 Cultural Revolution have reopened. In 1988 there were over
 30,000 churches, temples, monasteries, and mosques in service
 in the country. Many Buddhist and Daoist temples have
 reopened, often after restoration at government expense.
 A pressing shortage of priests, ministers, monks, and imams
 exists because the older generation of religious leaders is
 dying off, almost no replacements were trained between 1967
 and 1978, and the Government limits the number of new clergy
 and controls their appointments. Officials admit that there
 are not enough places of worship for religious believers.
 Since the implementation of a more liberal minorities policy
 in the early 1980's, young men have flocked to join seminaries
 and monasteries. Government sources estimate, for example,
 that there are presently 14,000 officially recognized monks
 and nuns in Tibet. Officials claim that they impose no limits
 on the number of monks and that there is no minimum age for
 entry into a monastic order. Unofficial sources, however,
 claim that the Government does limit the number of officially
 sanctioned monks at each monastery. Reports from Tibet
 indicate that many "unofficial" monks live in Tibetan
 monasteries. Although they live virtually as do other monks,
 their families must provide their food, unlike the official
 monks, who are supported by the monasteries.
 Since 1981 the authorities have permitted the establishment of
 seminaries to train a limited number of young people in
 religious orders. The Chinese Catholic Church has 10
 seminaries in operation. The Protestant Church also operates
 9 seminaries, in addition to the National Theological Institute
 in Nanjing. The Islamic association runs nine institutes
 throughout China to train imams and Islamic scholars. The
 Buddhist association has approximately 20 institutes
 
 
 774
 CHINA
 nationwide, including facilities in Beijing, Suzhou, and
 Nanjing. The Government opened a Tibetan Buddhist institute
 in Beijing in 1988. In addition to these major institutes,
 individual mosques and temples run their own small education
 and training programs.
 The religious associations sponsor a variety of publications
 for believers, including scriptures, teaching material,
 theological journals, and hymn books. Since 1980 for example,
 the Protestant China Christian Council has printed and
 distributed over 3 million Bibles; there were reports in 1988
 that Xinhua bookstore will also distribute them. Adherents of
 some religions complain the Government has failed to return
 some religious properties and redistributes their contributions
 to support other religions. The Government provides other
 forms of financial support for religious bodies (e.g., tax
 exemptions for rental income and cash subsidies to Muslims for
 observance of dietary law).
 The number of Christians has increased since 1978, with an
 official estimate of 3 million Catholics and 5 million
 Protestants in 1988. Informed unofficial estimates suggest
 there may be as many as 20 million. Officials state that there
 are 15 million actively practicing Muslims, and there are well
 in excess of 10 million practitioners of Buddhism. Daoist
 believers run into millions .
 Even though there has been an undeniable increase in the
 exercise of religious freedom in recent years, the authorities
 still react sharply to unsanctioned religious activity.
 Officials have repeatedly stressed that while it is government
 policy to protect "normal" religious practice, the Government
 will not tolerate "counterrevolutionary sabotage perpetrated
 in the name of religion." A recent example is the imposition
 of tight security in Lhasa following disturbances which drew
 the active participation of Buddhist monks. The Government
 placed security personnel in the major monasteries in Lhasa
 after the 1987 and 1988 riots. These personnel were withdrawn
 from the monasteries over the summer, returned in September,
 and withdrawn again at the end of October.
 Public security authorities closely monitor and sometimes
 harass Christians who prefer to worship outside the officially
 recognized "patriotic" church system in what are termed "house
 churches." For example, local officials in Guangzhou have
 repeatedly threatened since August to close down a well-known
 "house church" in Guangzhou. Any nonofficial organization of
 groups of churches and itinerant evangelism are prohibited.
 In 1983 the NPC Standing Committee authorized the death penalty
 for those organizing secret sects which spread "feudal and
 superstitious ideas." This provision appears to be aimed at
 resurgent traditional animist and cult practices.
 Because of concern over divided loyalties, the authorities
 carefully monitor and control contacts between Chinese and
 foreign religious organizations through the national-level
 religious associations. Even so, the Government has encouraged
 Chinese religious leaders to participate in international
 exchange activities. For example, the Bishop of Shanghai, Jin
 Luxian, has visited the United States, traveled to France for
 unofficial talks with French Catholic Church officials in May
 1987, and visited Hong Kong in 1988 where he talked with newly
 appointed Cardinal Wu and a retired bishop from Taiwan. Jin,
 
 
 CHINA
 who was arrested when Beijing broke with the Vatican in the
 1950's, cooperates with but has not joined the state-sponsored
 church.
 In April Evangelist Billy Graham visited China for 3 weeks at
 the invitation of the official China Christian Council and the
 Chinese People's Association for Friendship with Foreign
 Countries. He spoke to Chinese congregations in Beijing,
 Shanghai, and at a house church in Guangzhou, in addition to
 meeting with Premier Li Peng and other Chinese officials and
 religious leaders.
 China resumed giving permission to Muslim citizens to make the
 hajj in 1979. Since 1985 over 2,000 Chinese have journeyed to
 Mecca every year. In addition, there are indications that
 Chinese religious organizations may be permitted to receive
 funds or gifts from foreign religious organizations, if no
 strings are perceived to be attached.
 The Government insists, however, that the country's religious
 bodies must be independent of foreign control and warns
 against foreign attempts to interfere in Chinese religious
 affairs. The Government prohibits foreign missionaries from
 practicing among Chinese citizens. Foreigners with
 acknowledged ties to overseas religious institutions may work
 in China, often as English teachers, provided that they do not
 engage in open proselytizing. The Government seems to be
 willing to overlook minor infractions of this injunction,
 although those who have tested the limits of its tolerance in
 this regard have sparked official reactions (including denial
 of permission to extend a person's period of residence in China
 in one case).
 The authorities' concern over foreign influence largely has
 been directed at the Vatican in the past, in part due to the
 Vatican's continued diplomatic ties with Taiwan. Chinese
 priests who publicly maintain their loyalty to the Pope are
 subject to arrest and imprisonment. However, Chinese
 authorities released Catholic Bishop Gong Pingmei (Ignatious
 Kung) from prison in 1985 and ftom parole in January 1988.
 Bishop Gong was imprisoned in 1955 for his loyalty to Rome.
 The authorities have also released other Catholic clergymen.
 In January a Catholic Church official revealed that the Bishop
 of Baoding, Monsignor Peter Joseph Fan Xueyuan, was released
 from prison on parole in mid-1987. Bishop Fan was reported to
 have been sentenced to 10 years' imprisonment in 1983 for
 maintaining links to the Vatican and independently ordaining
 priests. Church sources in China also indicate that the
 authorities have released all priests held in Shanghai for
 their loyalty to the Pope.
 The Chinese oppose political activity by the Dalai Lama that
 they see as aimed at promoting Tibetan independence or raising
 questions about the status of Tibet. The Tibetan people's deep
 reverence for the Dalai Lama as a religious leader is tolerated
 in China, but people risk criminal charges if they participate
 in activities deemed to constitute agitation for Tibetan
 independence. The Tibetan exile community's religious ties to
 Tibetans in China are reportedly closely monitored by the
 Chinese authorities.

 CHINA
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Various formal and informal restrictions govern travel within
 China. Chinese citizens must have a written letter of
 introduction from their work unit to buy airplane tickets,
 secure hotel accommodations, or acquire ration coupons for
 purchase of some basic foodstuffs outside their place of
 residence. Those traveling by rail who plan to stay with
 relatives need not obtain letters of introduction, but are
 still legally required to register with local police during
 their visits.
 In practice, however, many Chinese do not comply. With higher
 income levels (particularly in the countryside), Chinese are
 traveling more frequently within the country, often ignoring
 restrictions without difficulty. This increased flouting of
 bureaucratic requirements was, no doubt, one reason why the
 authorities announced in April 1985 the adoption of the
 country's first nationwide identity card system. This plan is
 being implemented nationwide and is expected to be completed
 in 1989. According to Chinese press reports, police are
 empowered to check ID cards and take information from them.
 Cards must be presented among other things to transact most
 business in banks and post offices, to buy airplane tickets,
 or book a hotel room. Residents of Hainan province and the 4
 special economic zones are being issued specially color-coded
 ID cards, a step to assist in controlling unauthorized
 migration to those areas.
 Chinese citizens may not freely change their locality of
 residence or workplace. They are registered as residents of a
 particular jurisdiction. The authorities normally grant
 permission to move to another locality only for a change in
 employment. Rigid personnel policies, most notably the
 unwillingness of work units to sanction an employee's
 transfer, make it difficult to change jobs. However, the
 widening application of the labor contract system and
 accompanying pension reforms will likely increase labor
 mobility.
 Contracts generally run for 3 to 5 years, after which either
 party may decide not to renew. This will not immediately
 affect workers employed before October 1, 1986, who will
 continue to enjoy lifetime employment without a stipulated
 right to change jobs. The authorities have called for and
 have taken steps towards reform of the personnel system,
 aiming at greater mobility among scientists, technicians, and
 certain other professionals.
 Significant numbers of farmers are moving into small and
 medium-sized cities. Policies discouraging rural migration to
 large cities continue, but large numbers of unregistered
 people continue to move to and reside in China's biggest
 cities, with estimates of as many as 1 million in Shanghai and
 700,000 in Beijing.
 With the relaxation of controls on foreign travel and
 emigration since the late 1970's, tens of thousands of Chinese
 now go overseas every year to study, conduct business, or visit
 relatives. In November 1985, the Standing Committee of the NPC
 passed the "Citizens Exit and Entry Control Law," which went
 into effect February 1, 1986. The law provides for exit for
 personal reasons and denies exit to those involved in criminal
 
 
 777
 CHINA
 or civil cases or those whose exit may harm China's national
 security interests. In October 1988, noted Chinese
 astrophysicist Fang Lizhi was refused permission to participate
 in scientific conferences in the United States. Fang has been
 accused of criticizing the Chinese leadership during foreign
 visits.
 China relaxed restrictions on internal travel by foreigners by
 increasing the number of areas open to foreign visitors without
 special permission. Over 500 cities and other areas are now
 open to foreigners, up from 474 cities a year ago. Still,
 large portions of China remain officially closed. Chinese
 officials state that Lhasa is open, but travel by individual
 tourists, journalists, and others remains restricted.
 China does not revoke the citizenship of political dissidents
 and is not known to have exiled any dissidents (although as
 noted in Section l.d., a form of internal exile is practiced).
 The authorities have welcomed the return of Chinese who had
 fled their homeland earlier, the vast majority of whom are
 either residents of Hong Kong and Macau or "overseas" Chinese,
 including some former refugees.
 More than 280,000 refugees and displaced persons from Vietnam
 and Laos have resettled in China since 1978, most of them
 ethnic Chinese or persons married to ethnic Chinese. Ethnic
 Vietnamese refugees in China, now numbering less than a
 hundred, are housed in Fancheng Camp in the Guangxi autonomous
 region. Especially because of the current state of relations
 between Vietnam and China, these refugees, who do not in any
 case wish to remain in China, have had few opportunities for
 jobs or education. The Chinese Government is also clearly not
 inclined to have these refugees resettled in China. Given the
 anomalous situation of these refugees, the United Nations High
 Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) was attempting as of
 September 1988 to resettle these refugees in third countries.
 As of the end of November, there were no reports during the
 previous 12 months of the Government forcibly repatriating
 persons of any nationality who claimed refugee status,
 according to the UNHCR.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Citizens do not have the ability peacefully and legally to
 change government leadership or the Marxist-Leninist system of
 government. The Chinese political leadership is chosen by the
 CCP, which is the paramount source of political authority in
 the country. Within the party, a group of top leaders in
 several key organizations, including the Politburo, its five-
 member Standing Committee, and the Military Commission, share
 power.
 Under the doctrine of "democratic centralism," leaders at the
 top, after consultation within the party, make policy decisions
 which all party members and citizens are expected to support.
 Political debate and disagreement usually take place only
 before a decision is made. Once announced, all are expected
 to follow the party line. Nevertheless, there are means by
 which party members and others may debate established policies.
 These include the presentation of alternate points of view or
 criticism in the party-controlled press, the use of academic
 journals to present differing interpretations of supposedly
 theoretical matters, selective enforcement of policies,
 
 
 778
 CHINA
 exploitation of policy ambiguities, manipulation of news
 coverage, and informal and unpublicized debate at party and
 government meetings.
 Student demonstrations in December 1986 and January 1987 in
 several Chinese cities, including Beijing, Shanghai, Nanjing,
 and Tianjin, called for greater democracy, including more
 participation in local elections, multicandidate slates, and
 open discussion of political development through wall posters
 and in the media. The Government response to demonstrations,
 participated in by upwards of 50;000 students, was more
 restrained than in previous years.
 The ensuing ideological chill was accompanied by party
 disciplinary action against'intellectuals as part of the
 antibourgeois liberalization campaign, which included
 expulsion from jobs or the party, some detentions and abuse
 while in custody, and some formal arrests and convictions. In
 the late summer of 1987 in the period leading up to the 13th
 Party Congress, the chill gave way to a relaxation in the
 political environment. This overall relaxation continued in
 1988.
 During his opening speech to the Congress, then Acting Party
 General Secretary Zhao Ziyang said that it is "necessary to
 respect the will of the voters and ensure that they have more
 options in elections." He also said that the long-term guiding
 principles for China include building "democracy" on the basis
 of stability and unity.
 The NPC meets once a year for about 2 weeks to debate and
 approve government policies and personnel changes determined
 in advance by the CCP. The NPC rarely rejects proposed
 government policies, although some have been modified as a
 result of delegates' concerns. A noteworthy example occurred
 during the seventh NPC, when the Government submitted a plan
 for the large-scale reorganization of ministries and
 commissions under the State Council. The nightly television
 news during the NPC session showed delegates openly debating
 this proposal. The plan emerged from the NPC with significant
 revisions.
 The Standing Committee of the Politburo meets approximately
 every 2 months and has the power to approve laws. In 1986 the
 Standing Committee twice declined to pass a draft bankruptcy
 law proposed by the State'Council, despite amendments and a
 last minute plea -by supporters for its adoption. This refusal
 to act occasioned unusual, though brief, press mention of the
 names of persons on each side of the debate. The law, in
 modified form, eventually passed toward the end of the year.
 Similar, though less publicized, cases have also occurred.
 Women have scored few breakthroughs in the male-dominated
 political establishment. In late 1988, none of the 17 members
 of the Politburo was female. Of the 175 members of the CCP
 Central Committee, 10 were women. Two women served among the
 41 ministers and commission directors in the Government. Of
 government cadres, 28.5 percent were women. One woman served
 as a provincial governor. No women served as provincial party
 secretaries. Of the delegates to the 13th Party Congress in
 October 1987, 14.9 percent were women.

 CHINA
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Given the Government's policy of repressing dissent, there are
 no known specialized organizations within China which monitor
 or comment on human rights conditions. Several legal journals
 do, however, discuss questions having to do with the rights of
 the accused, of convicted prisoners, and other litigants. The
 Chinese regard their human rights record as an internal matter
 and generally concede no justification for foreign concern
 about it. The Government has not responded to an International
 Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) request, made earlier this
 year, to visit Chinese prisons, including those in Tibet.
 In the past, Chinese authorities generally did not respond
 even to factual questions on particular cases, such as
 imprisoned Catholic priests. In October 1986, however,
 officials did provide information in answer to a U.S. Embassy
 inquiry regarding certain priests and others thought to be
 "political prisoners", and an official spokesman responded in
 late 1987 to a press inquiry concerning an alleged Tibetan
 prisoner of conscience.
 Chinese officials have been willing to meet with U.S. officials
 and members of professional groups to discuss birth control
 policies, have provided increasing amounts of statistical data,
 and have facilitated visits to localities for further
 discussions.
 The Chinese have generally reacted defensively, with some
 exceptions, to foreign attempts to learn and see what has been
 happening in Tibet since the 1987 demonstrations. In October
 1987, shortly after the first series of demonstrations, TAR
 authorities expelled Western journalists from Tibet. At
 present, the TAR is avowedly "open" for media visits, as long
 as journalists abide by regulations for the foreign press, but
 it has approved few visits by foreign reporters.
 TAR authorities invited a number of journalists to cover the
 February/March prayer festival in Lhasa. Australian
 journalists were permitted to accompany then Foreign Minister
 Hayden, reportedly on condition that they not file stories
 from Lhasa. United States and British media representatives
 accompanied a U.S. Senate delegation on an August trip to
 Lhasa. A Cable News Network (CNN) reporter travelled to Tibet
 in mid-September. Some reporters have gone to Tibet as
 tourists, but TAR officials have warned them not to engage in
 activities incompatible with their status as tourists.
 Chinese officials also reduced the number of Western tourists
 visiting Tibet by restricting access to those who were part of
 tour groups. On the other hand, they arranged visits to Lhasa
 for West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, then Australian Foreign
 Minister Bill Hayden, a group of U.S. Representatives,
 Senators, and congressional staff members. This is the first
 time such visits and discussions of human rights situation
 with TAR officials have been permitted. Other Members of
 Congress and congressional staff seeking to examine the human
 rights situation in Tibet have been denied visas, however.
 The U.S. Ambassador to China travelled to Lhasa in August and
 raised human rights and access issues with officials,
 including the Chairman of the TAR.

 CHINA
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 The Constitution endorses the principle that all citizens are
 equal. In fact, discrimination based on sex, religion, and
 race persists. In the socioeconomic realm as in politics,
 women lag behind men despite progress in recent years. Female
 participation in the labor force has increased rapidly in the
 last few years, reaching 43.7 percent of the total work force
 in 1986, compared to 7.5 percent in 1950 and 36.4 percent in
 1984. Women now account for almost 37 percent of the urban
 work force, but women are still concentrated in the lower
 paying and less prestigious jobs.
 Although growth rates for the number of women in state
 positions, including scientific, engineering, and technical
 fields, appear to have been higher for women than men since
 1978, problems persist. Some commentators suggest that the
 reason for discriminatory treatment is that women are more
 expensive, but less productive, employees, and that a more
 "realistic" approach to women's liberation would encourage
 many working women to resume traditional roles of mother and
 housewife. At the end of 1987, 61.5 percent of youth "waiting
 for jobs" (i.e., unemployed) were women, up 1.3 percent from
 the previous year. In rural areas, where most women
 participate in agricultural production, underemployment is a
 serious problem.
 Regarding women's education, a 1986 survey of 8,000 large and
 medium-sized enterprises showed that of 6 million women
 workers, 4.5 percent had university educations, 82.1 percent
 had graduated from middle school, 12.2 percent had primary
 school educations, and 1.2 percent were illiterate. In the
 July 1987 college entrance examinations, there were 1,414,000
 male participants and 861,000 female participants. Currently,
 approximately 28 percent of the students in universities across
 China are female. Of the 200 million illiterates in China, 70
 percent are reportedly women.
 The party has taken a more liberal approach to minority policy
 since 1980. Minorities benefit from special treatment in
 marriage and family planning, employment, and university
 admission. Most of China's ethnic minorities live in areas
 they have traditionally inhabited. The standards of living of
 the vast majority of these minorities in China remain
 substantially below that of most Han Chinese areas. These
 areas are now governed by the "Law on Regional Autonomy for
 Minorities" which went into effect in 1984. This law, like the
 Constitution, provides that government heads of autonomous
 regions, prefectures, or counties must be members of the
 locally prevalent minority. Although vague on the
 implementation of rights to political autonomy for minority
 areas, the law clearly sets forth rights to preserve and
 develop local minorities' cultural traditions, use local
 minorities' languages, and practice local minorities' religion
 within the autonomous areas.
 CCP avowed policy is to increase minority representation in the
 Government and party in minority areas to levels reflecting
 the minority's share of the population, and to assign senior
 positions to minority persons. Nevertheless, minorities,
 effectively shut out from all but a few leadership positions in
 the Government and party, complain of discrimination by the Han
 majority, and key decisionmakers in most autonomous regions
 continue to be Han Chinese.
 
 
 781
 CHINA
 Reports from Urumqi indicate that students of the Uighur
 minority participated in a small demonstration in the spring
 of 1988. Incidents in Lhasa were only the most recent venting
 of intensely felt alienation by the distinctive and devoutly
 religious Tibetan people. A large proportion of the Tibetan
 population resents the economic and political dominance and
 military presence of the Han Chinese. According to official
 Chinese figures, Han Chinese constitute about 3 percent of the
 population in the Tibetan Autonomous Region (excluding the
 military), yet 40 percent of all government cadre, 40 percent
 of regional department heads, 38 percent of university
 students, and 60 percent of factory managers are Han. The
 authorities have declared that the liberalization of
 political, economic, and social policies toward Tibet which
 has been under way since 1980 will continue despite recent
 protests, some of which involved rockthrowing and arson by
 demonstrators.
 Many Tibetans in China still hope for the return of the Dalai
 Lama, but there remains a wide gap between the Dalai Lama and
 Beijing as to the conditions under which his return might be
 effected. The Chinese Government and the Dalai Lama have both
 offered to have their respective representatives resume
 discussions under certain conditions.
 In recent years, the Government has relaxed travel
 restrictions, allowing thousands of Tibetans to go to India to
 see the Dalai Lama and hundreds of exiles to return home to
 visit. The Government's declared policy aims at the steady
 incorporation of all minorities, including Tibetans, into the
 mainstream of China's political, economic, and social
 institutions. In the case of Tibet, this policy is motivated
 in political terms by a desire to strengthen social stability
 in a large, sensitive border region with a long history of de
 facto autonomy.
 Throughout 1988, as earlier, Beijing made it clear that it will
 not tolerate a Tibetan independence movement. The easing of
 restrictions begun by the PRC in Tibet in 1980 remains official
 policy, but PRC concern over public order and national unity
 has given priority to law enforcement and repression of
 dissent in the last 15 months.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 China's trade unions are closely controlled by the CCP. The
 All-China Federation of Trade Unions (ACFTU) has for the past
 2 years been engaged in drafting a new trade union law which
 will redefine the role of trade unions in China.
 Simultaneously, the Ministry of Labor and other government
 agencies have been drafting a comprehensive labor law. In the
 workplace, virtually all state-sector workers, and about 75
 percent of all urban sector workers, belong to branches of the
 ACFTU.
 Although not formally compulsory, membership in the ACFTU is
 an expected part of life in urban work units. The union's
 primary function is to promote labor discipline, enhance labor
 productivity, conduct political and ideological indoctrination,
 and improve workers' educational and technical skills. Unions
 
 
 782
 CHINA
 also perform a variety of social and welfare functions such as
 handling pensions and disability benefits, and operating clubs,
 eating facilities, nurseries, schools, and sanatoriums.
 Chinese workers are not assured the right to strike. Strikes
 are viewed by higher authorities as justified only as temporary
 responses to problems such as sudden deteriorations in safety
 conditions. During the first half of 1988, there were 49
 officially reported strikes--19 in the first quarter, and 30
 in the second. These actions received official attention
 because they could not be resolved within the work unit. In
 addition, informal work stoppages and slowdowns to express
 worker discontent are not uncommon and are apparently
 tolerated for brief periods as long as vital services and
 national security industries are not affected. Although there
 are no formal regulations regarding strikes in special economic
 zones, it appears that the authorities are more tolerant of
 strikes in the zones than in the rest of the country.
 The ACFTU claims to have contacts with trade unions in over
 120 countries or regions, and the federation has stated its
 desire to establish links with foreign unions regardless of
 any affiliation with the International Confederation of Free
 Trade Unions, the Soviet-dominated World Federation of Trade
 Unions, or other organizations. Since China joined the
 International Labor Organization (ILO) in 1983, an ACFTU
 official has served as China's worker delegate to that body.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 Under the labor contract system, which was instituted in 1986
 and now covers over 7 million workers, individual workers are
 permitted to negotiate with management over some contract
 terms, particularly the length of the employment contract. In
 practice, it is mostly only university graduates who are able
 to choose from among several offers and negotiate effectively
 on salary and fringe benefits.
 The Government does not permit collective bargaining. In
 addition, worker congresses were established in 1981 in most
 large and medium-sized enterprises. Congresses convene at
 least once or twice yearly. Initially confined largely to
 overseeing social welfare issues, the congresses have recently
 begun to fulfill the role originally intended for them as a
 sort of cabinet of advisors for the enterprise manager.
 China's law on state-owned industrial enterprises, passed by
 the NPC in April 1988, codifies the makeup and function of the
 congresses and directs the enterprise manager to consult the
 congress on all important decisions affecting the economic life
 of the enterprise or any worker benefits. Through their
 representatives, workers are thus theoretically able to exert
 an indirect influence on decisions which affect their economic
 well-being and the conditions of their employment.
 Labor laws and regulations appear to be enforced uniformly
 throughout the country except, as noted in Section l.a. above,
 there appears to be more government tolerance toward strikes
 in the special economic zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 China is still considering ratification of ILO Convention 105
 on forced labor. China's longstanding practice is that "reform
 through labor" or "education through labor" entails compulsory
 
 
 783
 CHINA
 labor. Prison and labor reform camps are expected to be
 partially self-supporting. There are no credible reports of
 forced labor outside of prison and labor reform camp settings.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 In mid-July the Ministry of Labor announced that, in
 cooperation with other government agencies, it was drafting a
 circular to curb an increasingly serious child labor problem.
 Growing reports of sweatshop-like enterprises exploiting child
 labor in rural areas and the Shenzhen Special Economic Zone
 likely spurred this decision. The regulations embodied in the
 circular were promulgated in November and imposed severe fines,
 loss of business licenses, or jail for offenders. Regulations
 promulgated in late 1987 also prohibit any organization or
 individual from employing school-age minors who have not
 completed the compulsory 9 years of education.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 There is no minimum wage. The Government claims that it cares
 for the poorest through allocation of subsidies. Conditions
 of work vary widely. In some poorer areas, even hard labor
 returns only a meager living, with subsidies crucial for
 survival. Subsidies, bonuses, and payments in kind are nearly
 universal in nonagricultural employment, making up as much as
 40 percent of a person's total income.
 In the workplace, occupational health and safety are constant
 themes of posters and campaigns, but progress in this area has
 depended to a considerable extent on the construction of more
 modern plants and equipment with built-in safety features.
 Large factories built in the 1950's with Soviet help tend to
 be noisy, dirty, and dangerous. Renovated plants and those
 constructed more recently and modeled on Japanese, American,
 and West European prototypes have incorporated many safety
 features into the basic design. Persistently low safety
 consciousness among workers and the impetus for greater labor
 productivity have impeded greater government attention to
 safety standards.
 Safety issues have figured prominently in formal programs
 covering nuclear power, mine safety, rail development, and
 civil aviation. Every production unit of any size must
 designate a health and safety officer; the ILO has established
 a training program for these officials. State procurators
 deal annually with thousands of negligence and accident cases
 involving criminal or civil liability.
