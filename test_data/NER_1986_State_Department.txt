 NIGER
 Niger is governed by an authoritarian military regime with
 power concentrated in the hands of its President, General
 Seyni Kountche, who heads the nation's highest body, the
 Supreme Military Council. Kountche took power in 1974 in a
 military coup, toppling the civilian regime of Hamani Diori.
 At that time the Constitution was suspended, and Kountche has
 since ruled by decree. The freedoms of assembly, speech, and
 political activity are restricted. Public dissent is almost
 nonexistent, and private dissent tends to be rare for fear of
 retribution.
 Niger, one of the world's poorest countries, occupies a large
 area in the arid Sahel region of West Africa. The economy
 hinges on subsistence farming, livestock, and some of the
 world's largest uranium deposits. However, severe drought, a
 3.1 percent population growth rate, and declining world demand
 for uranium since the early 1980's have had a serious negative
 impact on the Nigerien economy.
 The human rights situation in Niger improved marginally in
 1986. The Government is proceeding cautiously with the further
 development of the National Development Society, which many
 believe will lead to greater civilian involvement in economic
 decisionmaking. Substantial progress was made on a "national
 charter" which is scheduled to be the subject of an early
 national refrendum. President Kountche stressed publicly in
 April, however, that the armed forces will continue to play a
 preponderant role in the political life of the nation no matter
 how democratic institutions evolve. Early in 1986, trials of
 public officials accused of corruption were held in public,
 the defendants had able legal counsel, and the verdicts
 rendered were less than the maximum penalty (death) prescribed
 by the law. Those persons arrested following the October 1983
 coup attempt are still being held in detention. The
 restrictions on nighttime travel in Niger were lifted early in
 the year. Niger also signed the Organization of African
 Unity's African Charter of Human and Peoples' Rights in 1986.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There were no reports of political killings.
 b. Disappearance
 No disappearances were reported.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Systematic torture of detainees and prisoners is not believed
 to take place in Niger. While not officially sanctioned by
 the Government, cruel treatment, usually in the form of
 physical beatings, has been meted out, however, by officials
 charged with the custody of political prisoners. Non-Nigeriens
 resident in Niger are frequently harassed by the police and
 occasionally suffer physical abuse while in detention. It is
 believed that political prisoners or detainees are rarely
 allowed visits from family members, but some with severe
 
 
 219
 NIGER
 medical problems have been allowed treatment by specialists
 from Europe.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 With the Constitution suspended since 1974, there are no
 specific statutory protections against arbitrary arrest or
 imprisonment. Warrants are not required for an arrest, and
 there is no right to judicial review of the legality of
 arrests or detentions. For criminal offenses, the law holds
 that detainees must be charged within 48 hours, but delays
 sometimes occur as the result of a lack of trained legal
 officials. In cases concerning political or security-related
 matters, detainees can be held indefinitely without charge, as
 in the case of the 19 detainees held in connection with the
 October 1983 coup attempt who are still awaiting trial.
 Amnesty International estimated their number at 20-25 at the
 end of 1985. Former President Hamani Diori remained under
 house arrest at the end of 1986. When the Government believes
 the national security to be at risk, large numbers of citizens
 may be rounded up arbitrarily for questioning, as with the
 roundup of Tuaregs in Niamey after the attack on a police
 station in Tchin-Tabaraden in 1985.
 Forced labor is not practiced in Niger, but during the 1985
 drought emergency, displaced herders, primarily ethnic Tuaregs
 and Fulanis, were in some instances forcibly moved onto
 government-sponsored, vegetable-growing projects. There are
 no known instances of dissidents or political opponents being
 exiled by the Kountche Government, although some dissidents
 have voluntarily gone into exile.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The exact number of political prisoners in Niger is unknown.
 The 11 Tuaregs convicted and sentenced to death in connection
 with the Tchin-Tabaraden affair had reportedly not been
 executed by the end of 1986.
 Political and security-related cases are tried in the State
 Security Court, which operates outside the traditional legal
 framework. This body, established by presidential decree,
 meets in secret, and while little is known about its
 proceedings, it is believed that its members are military
 officers. According to Amnesty International, the Tuaregs
 condemned to death in 1985 were tried before this court.
 Civil and criminal cases not involving security-related acts
 are tried publicly. Legal counsel is provided for indigent
 defendants accused of felonies or other major offenses if they
 are under 18 years of age, handicapped, or faced with the
 possibility of a sentence of more than 10 years. While there
 are reliable accounts that courts in some specific cases have
 been subject to political influence or pressure in ordinary
 civil or criminal cases, the judicial system is believed to be
 generally independent and fair. Defendants may appeal verdicts
 first to an appellate court and, if desired, to the nation's
 highest tribunal, the State Court, composed of civilian
 magistrates, which serves as a final court of appeals. The
 President has the right of pardon in penal cases and has
 invoked this right on several occasions in recent years. At
 the village level, matters such as property disputes are
 frequently resolved by traditional means without reference to
 the formal legal system.

 NIGER
 In June 1985, President Kountche announced the formation of a
 special court to investigate civil service corruption. Stiff
 penalties were established for these crimes, including the
 death penalty for convictions of embezzlement of amounts over
 $500,000. At the corruption trials held in 1986, however,
 life imprisonment was the most severe penalty assessed.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The police have the right to enter homes between 5 a.m. and
 9 p.m. and will enter at other times if deemed necessary. Many
 of the Tuaregs rounded up in Niamey in early June were removed
 forcibly from their homes. Court warrants are not required in
 such instances. Violations of privacy such as interference
 with correspondence, telephone tapping, and use of informer
 networks are known to take place.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 These freedoms are restricted. Institutions which might voice
 dissent, such as an independent press or a freely elected
 legislature, do not exist. The media are controlled by the
 Government. While some criticism of government policy or
 bureaucratic inefficiency is allowed, especially in the weekly
 publication Sunday Sahel, such criticism is expressed at the
 behest of, or at least with the knowledge of, the Government.
 Debates on aspects of the economy or cultural policy sometimes
 take place in the media, but the boundaries of permissible
 discussion are well understood in advance by all participants.
 The primary functions of the media are to disseminate
 government policies and viewpoints and to rally popular support
 for government programs and leading figures such as the
 President. Nigerien journalists are acutely aware of their
 status as government employees and of the guidelines within
 which they must operate. Journalists who the Government
 believes have strayed from these guidelines have been demoted,
 fired, or otherwise disciplined in the past, although no such
 incidents occurred in 1986. While there are no legal
 constraints on academic freedom, in practice university
 students and professors are reluctant to speak openly about
 potentially controversial domestic issues for fear of
 government reprisal. There have been no reports of censored
 or banned magazines or other publications, but the Government
 is under no legal constraints should it discover material that
 it deems offensive. Foreign films are subject to censorship
 by the Ministry of Interior on grounds of public morality and
 political content.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Except for political parties, most forms of voluntary
 association, such as trade unions, churches, and other
 religious groups, function with the understanding that they
 must act in accordance with government policy. Government
 permission is required for public gatherings, although, in
 practice, public meetings of such organizations are usually
 allowed.
 The trade union movement is controlled and partially financed
 by the Government. All unions are organized under a
 government-controlled umbrella group, the National Union of
 Nigerien Workers (USTN). The head of the USTN is appointed by
 
 
 221
 NIGER
 the Government. The USTN represents about 30 percent of the
 approximately 60,000 salaried workers in Niger. The group is
 poorly financed partly because of government refusal to allow
 fund-raising methods such as a wage checkoff system. Lower
 level elections in the USTN are believed to be fairly
 democratic. Strikes in Niger are rare, although legal if
 conciliation and arbitration procedures have been exhausted.
 The USTN maintains relations with recognized international
 bodies and sends representatives to international meetings.
 It is a member of the Accra-based Organization of African
 Trade Union Unity.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Niger is overwhelmingly Muslim, but Christian Churches are
 allowed to operate freely. Conversion from one religion to
 another is not prohibited but rarely occurs. Foreign
 missionaries are permitted to live, work, and travel in
 Niger. There have been no reports of religious
 discrimination.   The Government, cautious because of the
 Islamic fundamentalist violence which erupts periodically in
 northern Nigeria, monitors Muslim religious activity through
 the Islamic Association. This Association is funded by the
 Government and assists in an informal government screening
 process of local religious leaders. Islamic services that
 have gone beyond strictly religious subjects have been shut
 down. Religious groups are allowed to maintain links with
 coreligionists in other countries.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Travel within Niger is closely monitored, although no special
 travel documents are required for domestic travel. Police
 checks, often entailing thorough searches, take place upon
 entering or leaving any major town or city. These checks
 reflect a governmental preoccupation with smuggling, a concern
 over possible movements into the country of foreign-based
 dissidents or criminal elements, and a policy designed to
 discourage migration to urban areas. Nigeriens wishing to
 travel abroad must obtain exit visas, which are usually granted
 routinely. Married women must have the permission of their
 husbands to travel abroad. The repatriation of Nigerien
 nationals is unrestricted. In May 1986, the Government
 efficiently resettled about 2,000 Nigeriens who were expelled
 from neighboring Algeria. Niger is a party to the U.N.
 Convention and Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees and
 has been very cooperative respecting the 19 refugees currently
 in Niger under U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees auspices.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 The capacity of the people to influence the Government is
 extremely limited. Virtually all power is held by the
 President, General Seyni Kountche. He rules through the
 Supreme Military Council which is made up of officers who
 helped stage the 1974 coup that toppled the previous civilian
 regime. Kountche rules by decree, makes all government
 appointments, and controls the pace of political change and
 economic development. Government operations are conducted
 largly by civilian technocrats who implement decisions
 promulgated by the Supreme Military Council and Kountche
 himself. The President derives his power from the military.
 While all but three of the ministerial positions have passed
 
 
 222
 NIGER
 from military to civilian hands in recent years, all of
 Niger's seven departments have military governors, who have
 virtually autocratic power within their departments.
 Moreover, there is a marked military presence in the upper
 echelons of the National Development Society.
 In lieu of a party system, the Kountche Government since 1979
 has been organizing the National Development Society which in
 theory will lead to greater popular participation in economic
 decisionmaking. The Society consists of a hierarchical
 network of councils at the village, regional, departmental,
 and national levels. The councils consist of elected and
 appointed members, although only at the village level are
 members elected directly by the people. The national level
 council consists of Nigeriens from all walks of life, who also
 serve on special committees to consider various aspects of
 economic development, cultural policy, and social issues. One
 such committee has written and widely distributed a national
 charter which, it is believed, could serve eventually as the
 basis for a new constitution.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Niger is not active in regional and international human rights
 organizations. In recent years, inquiries from international
 human rights organizations have apparently been ignored by the
 Government. There are no domestic groups which monitor the
 human rights situation in Niger.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 The essentially traditional nature of Nigerien society helps
 ensure that family and ethnic group ties remain strong and
 supportive, but traditional practices and attitudes on
 ethnicity, women, and education have some negative effects.
 Males have considerable advantages in terms of education,
 employment, and property rights. In case of divorce, custody
 of all children under 8 years of age is given to the husband.
 Conscious of this situation, the Government has made progress
 in improving the status of women by launching work on a new
 family code, by providing better employment opportunities to
 women, by giving them a significant role in the National
 Development Society, and by supporting the National Women's
 Association. In 1986 the Government continued to encourage
 Nigeriens to practice birth control.
 Four major ethnic groups, each with its own language, make up
 the bulk of the population. The two primarily nomadic groups,
 Tuaregs and Fulani (Peul), have less access to government
 services, partly because their transient lifestyles make it
 difficult for the Government to supply them with services and
 partly because of historical animosities between the nomads
 and the sedentary Djerma and Hausa ethnic groups which
 dominate the Government.
 CONDITIONS OF LABOR
 Under the Niger labor code, workers receive benefits for
 on-the-job injury, leave for family emergencies, and health
 benefits. Annual holidays and leave benefits are clearly
 defined. Children between the ages of 12 and 18 may be
 employed, but there are strict provisions concerning the hours
 
 
 223
 NIGER
 of employment and types of employment for children in this age
 group. All labor provisions, especially those concerning
 child labor, apply in practice only to urban areas. In the
 agricultural sector, which employs most Nigeriens, children
 work on family plots under conditions which are not in
 compliance with the provisions of the labor code.
