 CYPRUS
 Cyprus has been divided since the Turkish military intervention of 1974, following
 a coup d'etat directed from Greece. Since 1974, the southern part of the country has
 been under the control of the Government of the Republic of Cyprus. The northern
 part is ruled by an autonomous Turkish Cypriot administration supported by the
 presence of Turkish troops. In 1983 that administration proclaimed itself the "Turk-
 ish Republicof Northern Cyprus" ("TRNC'), which is recognized only by Turkey. The
 "TRNC" is a parliamentary structure; the "Prime Minister" and "Council of Min-
 isters" are drawn primarily from the "Assembly". The Government of Cyprus is a
 presidential system.
 The internal political system of the government-controlled area is a democracy
 and in general accords basic human rights to its population, both in law and in
 practice. The internal political structure in the Turkish Cypriot administration is
 also based on free elections. The Turkish Cypriot administration generally respects
 basic human rights but routinely restricts the freedom of Turkish Cypriots to travel
 to the Greek Cypriot-controlled areas or even into the U.N.-patrolled buffer zone
 which divides the two communities.
 Both Cypriot economies are based on free enterprise. The Greek Cypriot economy
 has prospered in recent years, particularly in the tourism and manufacturing sec-
 tors, but entered into a slight recession in 1993 as tourism revenues fell. The much
 smaller economy in the Turkish Cypriot area, closely linked to that of Turkey and
 plagued by Turkey's high inflation rate, remained depressed in 1993, although a re-
 surgence in the banking, education, and tourism sectors is evident.
 Conflict between the Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot communities during the
 1963-74 period, followed in 1974 by the abortive Greek Cypriot coup and subse-
 quent Turkish intervention, resulted in the uprooting of Greek Cypriots and Turkish
 Cypriots from the northern and southern parts of the island, respectively. The re-
 sultant loss of lives, homes, and livelihoods has led to continuing charges of human
 rights violations by both sides. United Nations Forces in Cyprus (UNFICYP) mon-
 itors the welfare of the Greek Cypriots and Maronites in the north, as well as that
 of the Turkish Cypriots in the south.

 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political or
 extrajudicial killings.
 b. Disappearane.-There were no reports of persons abducted, secretly arrested,
 or held in clandestine detention.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Both the Cyprus Constitution and the basic document governing the Turkish Cyp-
 riot community specifically prohibit torture. Freedom from cruel, inhuman, or de-
 gading treatment or punishment is provided for in law in both communities. While
 ese laws are generally respected in practice, allegations of police brutality in the
 Greek Cypriot community have become more common and have been given wide-
 spread publicity. In May the Council of Europe's Committee for the Prevention of
 Torture submitted a report to the Government concluding that "persons held in cer-
 tain police establishments in Cyprus--particularly in Limassol town police station-
 run a serious risk of severe ill-treatment/torture."
 In the most celebrated case, a Limassol man falsely arrested in 1992 for bank rob-
 bery claimed he had been beaten and subjected to electric shocks. The Government
 prosecuted two high-ranking police officers, but the presiding judicial panel dis-
 missed the case in July for insufficient evidence, noting in its decision that the pris-
 oner had clearly been mistreated but that the prosecution had failed to establish
 conclusively that the two officers charged were actually responsible.
 In September 1993 police officers arrested a man in Larnaca on an unsubstan-
 tiated harge and severely beat him. Newspapers published photographs of the
 man's resulting 34 stitches and extensive bruises. Four officers involved were sus-
 pended pending an internal police investigation. The Government established a spe-
 cial commission to examine allegations of plice brutality; no results had been an-
 nounced by year's end. A bill addressing police brutality was scheduled for early de-
 bate in Parliament, according to its sponsors. If passed, the law would define as a
 felony the "torture, cruel or humiliating treatment of detainees," liable to imprison-
 ment of up to 3 years or a $6,000 fine, or both. If a detainee suffers "serious bodily
 injuries', those convicted of the abuse could face a prison term of up to 5 years or
 a $10,000 fine, or both.
 In the Turkish Cypriot community, allegations of police beatings are infrequent
 but not unknown: one Turkish Cypriot youth complained in April that he was beat-
 en by police officers despite being the son of a policeman himself. The police replied
 that the youth had not identified himself as such. No investigation was conducted,
 and no charges were ever filed. Victims of such abuse rarely come forward.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Laws providing for freedom from arbi-
 trary arrest and detention are respected by the Government of Cyprus and Turkish
 Cyriot authorities. Arrest warrants, issued by judges, are required. No one may be
 held for more than 1 day for investigation of a crime without referral of the case
 to the courts for extension of the period of detention. Most periods of investigative
 detention do not exceed 8 to 10 days before formal charges are filed. Attorneys have
 free access to detainees, and bail is perm.i.tted. Exile is specifically prohibited by the
 Cyprus Constitution and by the basic document governing the Turkish Cypriot com-
 munity.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.--Cyprus inherited many elements of its legal sys-
 tem from the British legal tradition, including the presumption of innocence, the
 right to due process, and the right of appeal.In both parts of Cyprus, fair public
 trial is provided for in law and accorded in ractice. The judiciary is independent
 of executive or military control. Defendants have the right to be present at their
 trials to be represented by counsel (at government expense for those who cannot
 afford one), to confront witnesses, and to present evidence in their own defense.
 Cases are generally tried before a judge or panel of judges, although a request
 for a jury trial is usually granted. There are no special courts to try security or po-
 litical offenses.
 On the Turkish Cypriot side, civilians deemed to have violated military zones are
 subject o t rial in a military court. These courts consist of one military and two civil-
 ian judges and a civilian prosecutor. Defendants in military courts have all the due
 process rights available in civilian courts. There were no trials of civilians in mili-
 tary courts in 1993.
 There are no political prisoners in Cyprus.
 f. Arbitrary cnterference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-Both
 the Cyprus Constitution and the basic document governing the Turkish Cypriot
 community include prvisions protecting the individual against arbitrary inter-
 
 
 846
 ference by the authorities. A judicial warrant is required, for example, for a police
 official to enter a private residence.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-These rights are provided for by law and are
 freely practiced throughout the island. The press is free and represents the entire
 political spectrum. There is no press censorship. In the Greek Cypriot community,
 several private television and radio stations compete effectively with the govern-
 ment-controlled stations. Turkish Cypriot authorities retain monopoly control over
 both radio and television, but in late 1993 a special commission was established to
 consider the lifting of this monopoly. International broadcasts are available through-
 out the island, including telecasts from mainland Turkey and Greece. In addition,
 the proliferation of party and independent newspapers and periodicals in both com-
 munities enables ideas and arguments to circulate freely. Opposition papers fre-
 quently criticize the authorities.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The freedom to associate, orga-
 nize, and hold meetings is protected by law and generally respected in practice.
 c. Freedom of Religin.-Freedom of religion is respected in Cyprus. In the south,
 the vast majority of the population is Greek Orthodox; in the north, Sunni Muslim.
 The Greek Orthodox Church in the south has the character of a state institution;
 all its activities and holdings are exempt from taxation. Although missionaries have
 the legal right to proselytize in both communities, missionary activities are closely
 monitored by theGreek Cypriot Orthodox Church and by both Greek Cypriot and
 Turkish Cypriot authorities.
 The approximately 300 Turkish Cypriots known to reside in the southern part of
 the island are allowed to practice their religion freely. In the north, non-Muslims
 include approximately 550 Greek Cypriots, 200 Christian Maronites, and some for-
 eign residents--all of whom are free to practice their religions.
 A 1992 law allows alternative service for those Greek Cypriots who conscien-
 tiously object to military service on religious grounds: they may select either 34
 months of unarmed military service or 42 months of civil defense force or social
 service, compared to 26 months of military service. However, this service still falls
 under the auspices of the military, so it does not constitute alternative civilian serv-
 ice. There are approximately 10 conscientious objectors in prison in the Republic,
 all of whom are Jehovah's Witnesses serving sentences of up to 32 months. Turkish
 Cypriot conscientious objectors have no alternative to military service and face im-
 prisonment if they refuse to serve. Amnesty International in 1993 noted the first
 case of imprisonment of a conscientious objector in the north, who was sentenced
 to 3 years. He was also charged with insulting the security forces in northern Cy-
 prus for statements he made in a press conference explaining his reasons for refus-
 ing military service and his willingness to serve an equivalent term in alternative
 civilian service.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-Turkish Cypriots and Greek Cypriots enjoy general freedom of move-
 ment within their respective areas. However, Turkish Cypriot authorities strictl
 regulate travel by Turkish Cypriots into the government-controlled area. Turkish
 Cyriots who apply for permission to visit the south are required to justify their ap-
 plications with formal invitations to events arranged by individuals or organizations
 resident in the south. Applicants are sometimes not given a reply until the last
 minute, and many are refused. Those who are denied permission are rarely given
 an official reason, but the basis for most denials is clearly political. Turkish Cypriot
 authorities sometimes cite developments in the U.N.-led negotiations, which they
 view as unfavorable, as reason enough to discourage bicommunal contacts. One well-
 known Turkish Cypriot dissident, Dr. Ahmet Cavit, has been consistently denied
 permission to travel into the south, despite multiple applications, because of his out-
 spoken criticism of the ruling regime. 4TRNC" civil servants periodically face a blan-
 ket prohibition against traveling from the 'TRNC" into the south, or even into the
 U.N.-patrolled buffer zone.
 The applications of Greek Cypriot residents of enclaves in the north to visit the
 south are usually granted, but the applicants must return within a designated pe-
 riod or risk losing their right to return, as well as their property. Turkish Cypriot
 authorities usually deny applications byGreek Cypriots to visit relatives in the
 north. They also generally bar Greeks, Greek Cypriots, and even third-country na-
 tionals with Greek or Armenian surnames from entering the north.
 The Government of Cyprus has barred travel to the north by foreigners intending
 to depart the island from theTurkish Cypriot area. At the same time, it bars entry
 into the Greek Cypriot area by foreigners who have entered Cyprus from the north.
 
 
 The right to travel abroad and to emigrate is observed, although persons facing
 military service or legal action in either part of Cyprus may not travel without spe-
 cific permission. Turkish Cypriots have difficulty traveling to most countries because
 travel documents issued by the "TRNC" authorities are not generally recognized.
 The Government of Cyprus does not accept third-country refugees for resettlement
 in Cyprus on the grounds that it already has enough responsibilities in caring for
 those displaced after the 1974 Turkish intervention. All refugee and asylum claim-
 ants are referred to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR),
 who is expected to process their applications and ensure their departure from Cy-
 prus. The Government has been cooperative in extending residency permission to
 those under consideration by the UNHCR and does not generally repatriate claim-
 ants to their home country. There has not been any resettlement of internal refu-
 gees, despite U.N. resolutions calling for such resettlement.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Both the Government of Cyprus and the Turkish Cypriot administration have
 lively multiparty political systems. Political parties compete for popular su port ac-
 tively and without restriction. Suffrage is universal, and elections are held y secret
 ballot. Elections for the office of President of the Republic of Cyprus are held every
 5 years and for the House of Representatives every 5 years or less.
 The Turkish Cypriots elect a leader and a representative body every 5 years or
 less. The Turkish Cypriot voters went to the polls on December 12 in an early elec-
 tion that brought opposition party representatives back into the "assembly" and re-
 sulted in a new coalition "government." The opposition parties had been boycotting
 the "assembly" since 1990 due to allegations that the previous election law was un-
 fair and that Turkey had intervened in the campaign. Greek Cypriots and
 Maronites living in the north-the latter having chosen before independence in 1960
 to be regarded as members of the Greek Cypriot community-are barred by law
 from participating in Turkish Cypriot elections but choose their own village officials.
 They are eligible to vote in Greek Cypriot elections but must travel to the south
 to exercise that right.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 There are organizations in both parts of the island that consider themselves
 human rights groups but, with the exception of one new Greek Cypriot group all
 appear to be primarily concerned with alleged violations of the rights of members
 oftheir community by the other community. The new group was established in re-
 sponse to increased allegations of police brutality.
 There are no restrictions preventing the formation of human rights groups, and
 representatives of international human rights organizations have access throughout
 the island. Although it requests assistance from other governments in resolving
 missing persons cases dating back to the 1974 Turkish military intervention, the
 Government of Cyprus would not submit outstanding cases to the United Nations
 Committee on Missing Persons which meets in Cyprus. In November the Cyprus
 government agreed to begin submitting all of its remaining cases to the U.N. Com-
 mittee on Missing Persons and to review the criteria for closing out these files.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 Women.-Throughout Cyprus, women generally have the same legal status as
 men, although women's groups in the Turkish Cypriot community contend that the
 law regulating divorce discriminates against women. While legal provisions requir-
 ing equal pay for men and women performing the same job are effectively enforced,
 many women's rights advocates complain that women disproportionately fill lower
 paying jobs. Apparently most private employers successfully implemented a 1989
 law requiring equality of pay between men and women working in the private sector
 by the October 1992 deadline.
 The Center Against Family Violence, a private Greek Cypriot organization, re-
 ports a steady number of domestic abuse cases, primarily violence against women
 by their husbands. Women can and do pursue these cases in the courts: some 530
 cases were prosecuted in 1992, according to the Center, which indicates the cases
 are treated seriously. Officials at the Center believe greater openness is shown by
 many women on this subject, which previously was considered taboo. The law com-
 missioner has drafted new legislation providing harsher penalties for offenders, who
 would also be obliged to undergo psychiatric treatment. This legislation was ap-
 proved in October by the Council of Ministers, which authorized the Minister of Jus-
 tice to submit the bill to the House. There is no similar center in the Turkish Cyp-
 
 
 848
 riot community. The Turkish Cypriot authorities have not made pronouncements or
 taken specific actions on this issue.
 Western European journalists, including a Belgian author and a British Broad-
 casting Corporation reporter, have labeled-Cyprus a center for trafficking in female
 prostitutes, primarily from Eastern Europe, the Philippines, and Thailand. Accord-
 ing to the accusations, which are credible, the women are lured to Cyprus by caba-
 ret owners who promise them well-paying nightclub "artiste" jobs and then force
 them into prostitution either in Cyprus or in a third country. A loose coalition of
 women's groups has been investigating the issue, alongside a parliamentary inquiry.
 The Government established a fund to provide for the welfare of women trying to
 escapo such servitude. Considerably fewer foreign "artistes" work in the    ish
 Cypriot community, but similar allegations are heard privately that some of the
 women are mistreated and even forced to prostitute themselves.
 Children.-Instances of child abuse are extremely rare in both communities.
 Within the context of total resources available to each community, spending on chil-
 dren's welfare is adequate.
 National/Racial /Ethnic Minorities.-Both the Government of Cyprus and the
 Turkish Cypriot administration have constitutional or legal bars against discrimina-
 tion. Food, shelter, education, and health care are available to members of both com-
 munities and the tiny Maronite, Armenian, and Latin minorities, regardless of race,
 religion, or ethnic background. Nevertheless, Greek Cypriots living in the north,
 predominantly in the Karpass area, continue to complain that they are unable to
 move about freely and are unable to change their housing at will. Some Turkish
 Cypriots living in the government-controlled area have claimed they are often har-
 assed by the community, including by the police. According to some allegations, they
 are kept under surveillance and questioned closely about their movements.
 People with Disabilities.-Physically or otherwise disabled individuals have no
 special protection against discrimination in private sector employment in Cyprus,
 and traditional attitudes are slow to change. In the government-controlled area, dis-
 abled persons applying for a public sector position are entitled to preference if they
 are deemed able to carry out the position requirements and if their qualifications
 equal those of other applicants. In theTurkish Cypriot community, regulations re-
 quire businesses to employ 1 disabled person for every 25 positions they fill. Still
 enforcement appears unreliable. Disabled persons do not appear to be discriminated
 against in education and the provision of state services. The Cyprus Government en-
 acted legislation effective June 1 mandating that new public buildings provide ac-
 cess for the disabled; in August new regulations were implemented stipulating that
 any new hotel or tourist resort provide access points and necessary facilities for dis-
 abled persons. The Turkish Cypriot community so far has not enacted legislation or
 otherwise mandated provision of accessibility for the disabled.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-AI1 workers in Cyprus, except for members of the
 police and military forces, have the legal right to form and join trade unions of their
 own choosing without prior authorization. More than 90 percent of Greek Cypriot
 workers and 40 to 50 percent of Turkish Cypriot workers belong to independent
 trade unions. Union officials in the north, however, allege that the ruling party has
 tried to weaken public sector unions by supporting the establishment of rival
 unions; the union officials have taken their complaints to the International Labor
 Organization (ILO). The ILO has not given an official reply to these complaints,
 which are difficult to substantiate. In both communities, trade unions freely and
 regularly take stands on public policy issues affecting workers and maintain their
 independence from the Government, although most are closely aligned with political
 parties.
 Cypriot workers have the right to strike. Several strikes occurred in 1993. Strikes
 usually are of short duration. Both the Government of Cyprus and the Turkish Cyp-
 riot authorities have the power to curtail strikes in what they deem to be "essential
 services."
 Unions in both parts of Cyprus freely take part in international meetings. Most
 unions are affiliated either with the International Confederation of Free Trade
 Unions or with the formerly Soviet-controlled World Federation of Trade Unions.
 Labor unions, more than most other organizations in Cyprus, attempt to maintain
 contact and cooperation across the dividing line, but this remains limited, mostly
 by Turkish Cypriot authorities.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-By law, trade unions and con-
 federations are free to organize and to bargain collectively in both parts of Cyprus.
 This is observed in practice in the south, and most wages and benefits are set by
 freely negotiated collective agreements. In the north, wage levels in many sectors
 
 
 849
 are largely pegged to the annual change in the minimum wage, set by a special com-
 mission composed of five representatives each from organized labor, employers, and
 the authorities. Union leaders contend that private sector employers are able to dis-
 courage union activity because enforcement is weak and penalties for antiunion
 practices are minimal. In both the north and the south, parties to a dispute may
 request mediation by the authorities.
 Small export processing zones exist in Larnaca port in the south and Famagusta
 in the north, but the laws governing working conditions and actual practice are uni-
 form throughout the country.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced or compulsory labor is pro-
 hibited by law, and no instances of it were reported.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The Government of Cyprus has
 set the minimum age for employment of children in an "industrial undertaking" at
 age 16. In the north, the age is 15. Government labor inspectors effectively enforce
 the law in both sectors.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The legislated minimum wage in the south is
 renewed every year and covers clerks, salespersons, nursery assistants, practical
 nurses, and hairdressers. It is not sufficient to provide an adequate living for a
 worker and family. All other occupations are covered under collective bargaining
 agreements between trade unions and employers within the same economic sector,
 and the minimum wages set in these agreements are significantly higher than the
 legislated minimum wage. The legislated minimum wage in the Turkish Cypriot
 area, while more broadly applicable and renewed annually after tripartite negotia-
 tions, would not be adequate to support a worker and family. Most workers earn
 more than the minimum wage.
 The Government of Cyprus has set 40 hours as the standard workweek except for
 shop workers and drivers, whose legal workweek is 42 hours. In 1992, however,
 Greek Cypriot unions won concessions that will reduce the workweek by one-half
 hour per year until 1997 when a 38-hour workweek will be in place for most sectors
 of the economy. In the north, the standard workweek is 38 hours in the winter and
 36 in the summer. Government labor inspectors effectively enforce these laws.
 Although standards in both sectors are not equivalent to those in Western indus-
 trialized countries, occupational safety and heath regulations are administered ef-
 fectively. In both sectors, a factory inspector receives and processes complaints and
 inspects businesses in order to ensure that occupational safety laws are observed.
 Workers who file complaints are protected by law and the court system in the Greek
 Cypriot sector but not in the Turkish Cypriot sector. In both sectors, however, work-
 ers risk losing their jobs if they unilaterally remove themselves from a position
 which they believe endangers their health.
