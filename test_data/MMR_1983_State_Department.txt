 BURMA
 
 The Socialist Republic of the Union of Burma is a one-party,
 authoritarian state whose leaders come from a narrow elite
 within the military. The ruling Burma Socialist Program Party
 (BSPP) dominates the government, which it parallels. The party
 itself is subordinate to its chairman, U Ne Win, who was
 commander of the army in 1962 when the present regime came into
 power in a coup. The government is headed by a twenty-nine
 member Council of State, the chairman of which, U San Yu, is ex
 officio president of Burma. A unicameral National Assembly
 includes 451 members elected for four-year terms, and is the
 titular source of all power in the state. Though non party
 members are permitted to run for the National Assembly and
 "People's Councils", the basic unit of local administration,
 lists of candidates are approved by the BSPP which is the only
 legal party.
 The Government is trying to build a centrally planned economic
 system under an ideological program known as the "Burmese Way
 to Socialism". Most significant economic enterprises are
 government owned, and control of the economy is centralized.
 For many years, the Government pursued a rigid policy of
 economic self-sufficiency; an historical tradition of
 isolationism has contributed to political and cultural
 insularity as well. After encountering serious economic
 difficulties in the early 1970's, the Government has over the
 past decade tempered its doctrinaire socialism with some
 pragmatic economic measures, including greater tolerance of the
 private sector and acceptance of foreign grant and loan
 capital.
 A central factor affecting the human rights situation in Burma
 has been the continued widespread insurgencies against the
 central government. Dozens of different insurgent groups, most
 based among Burma's ethnic minorities, have been locked for
 decades in a military stalemate with the Government. There are
 recurrent reports of human rights abuses by all sides in the
 fighting.
 In 1962, Burma's army, led by General Ne Win, overthrew the
 elected civilian government of Prime Minister U Nu, claiming
 that parliamentary democracy had failed to promote economic
 development and safeguard national unity. The 1974
 Constitution established the framework of Burma's one-party
 government. The BSPP is recognized as the sole political party
 and is given responsibility to "lead the state". It is
 dominated by active duty or retired military officers and all
 major decisions are subject to the approval of the party
 chairman, U Ne Win. Only seven percent of the adult population
 are party members. Candidates for election to the various
 levels of state administration are nominated by the party and
 run unopposed, though they can occasionally be defeated by a
 negative vote. Opposition political groups are banned, and
 public criticism of the Government is not tolerated.
 A 1975 anti-subversion law codified the wide discretionary
 powers of government security agencies. Several government
 organizations, sometimes competing, are charged with state
 security. In addition, each local People's Council has its own
 security committee with block and neighborhood wardens in
 cities and towns. There is a wide divergence between the
 handling of common criminal cases and the handling of cases
 involving national security or political opposition.

 Several hundred thousand descendents of Indian and Chinese
 immigrants live in Burma, some with Burmese citizenship, some
 with legal resident alien status, and some without
 documentation of any kind. Under the Burmese Citizenship Law
 of 1982, even those who are "citizens" generally do not enjoy
 all the political, economic and educational rights of "full
 citizens" (ethnic Burmese as defined by law and the Council of
 State).
 Burma remains among the world's least developed countries
 according to most economic measures. The right to own private
 property, alone or in association with others, is recognized by
 the Constitution and respected in practice: the state retains
 ultimate rights to all land and natural resources. The
 Government either owns or controls most economic enterprises of
 any size or significance. The inefficiency of the centrally
 planned economy has resulted in the creation of a thriving
 black market and large scale smuggling reportedly amounting to
 one-third of the Gross National Product.
 Aside from the period from 1948 to 1963 following independence,
 Burma has had little experience with democratic government. It
 has faced continual threats within the country. Insurgent
 ethnic groups for decades have fought for autonomy or
 independence and against centralized control and what they
 perceive to be domination by ethnic Burmans, who constitute at
 least two-thirds of the population. The Burma Communist Party
 has also been fighting for over 30 years to overthrow the
 central government. The Communists and many of the insurgent
 groups traffic in narcotics to finance their operations. Some
 of the insurgent groups are in effect narcotics syndicates with
 private armies.
 Sporadic violence between Burmese Buddhists and Muslims, who
 are primarily of Indian descent, occurred in various locations
 during 1983. There were some deaths, and several hundred
 persons reportedly were detained in connection with these
 incidents. A number of persons was also detained in connection
 with the terrorist bombing in Rangoon on October 9 of a
 visiting South Korean Presidential delegation by North Korean
 commandos; two North Koreans were subsequently tried and
 convicted of murder in a Burmese court. Finally, several
 hundred government, military, and party officials were
 dismissed from their positions, detained, or arrested,
 following the arrests of the former Joint General Secretary of
 the party and the former Minister for Home and Religious
 Affairs.
 There was little change in the overall human rights situation
 in Burma in 1983. The abuses committed by all sides in the
 insurgencies continued. Political opposition remained banned
 and authoritarian control over the political and economic
 systems was unchanged. Individuals of non-Burmese ancestry
 continued to face institutionalized discrimination. Members of
 non-Burman ethnic minorities, even though officially recognized
 as citizens, sometimes suffered from discrimination based on
 their suspect loyalty and were able only rarely to rise to
 positions of power. Hundreds of undocumented "illegal aliens"
 continued to be held in indefinite detention, some for many
 years. Freedom of speech, press, and association continued to
 be severely restricted.

 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from;
 a. Unlawful or Arbitary Deprivation of Life
 There are frequent credible reports of noncombatant deaths
 resulting from the fighting with the insurgents. Occasionally,
 insurgents have camped in villages to use noncombatant
 civilians as a shield against attack. Some insurgent groups
 have carried out summary executions of prisoners, opponents,
 and suspected informers. Some insurgent groups have resorted
 to terrorist attacks such as bombings, train derailments,
 kidnappings, and assassinations.
 Although summary executions are not allowed under the Burmese
 judicial system, there have been unconfirmed reports that
 government forces have occasionally executed captured prisoners
 or killed suspected insurgent supporters during military
 operations. Government forces often conscript civilian porters
 for use in military operations, and their deaths from mines and
 other causes are reported frequently.
 On October 9, a terrorist bombing attack against the visiting
 Presidential delegation from the Republic of Korea resulted in
 the deaths of 17 South Koreans and 4 Burmese. This crime was
 perpetrated by agents of North Korea, several of whom were
 apprehended near Rangoon shortly after the bombing. These
 individuals subsequently were put on trial and sentenced to
 death for murder on December 9, 1983.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reports over the past year of people being
 abducted, secretly arrested, or held in clandestine detention
 by security forces. There is no attempt to conceal common
 criminal or political/security arrests from family members,
 although details about the charges may not be revealed. Some
 insurgent groups have resorted to abduction as a political
 weapon or to coerce local inhabitants into cooperation.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 The Constitution provides that punishment shall not be in
 violation of human dignity, and the Government denies that
 torture or inhuman treatment is practiced. However, persistent
 reports suggest that the police and other security forces
 continue to use physical and psychological coercion, including
 torture, during investigations in order to obtain confessions
 or other information in both common criminal and
 political/security cases. There are unconfirmed reports of
 mistreatment of some political/security prisoners in regular
 prison facilities. In July, the clandestine radio station of
 the Burma Communist Party broadcast an extensive series of
 articles detailing alleged mistreatment and systematic torture
 of political prisoners in Burmese jails. There is no
 independent confirmation of these charges, although
 mistreatment is sometimes reported by other sources. Prison
 conditions are poor as a consequence of the generally low
 standard of living, over-crowding, low government expenditures,
 and limited staff.
 
 
 732
 There are credible reports that some insurgent groups employ
 death threats, beatings, and other forms of physical and mental
 coercion against opponents or villagers who refuse to cooperate
 with them.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Individuals are detained and punished for publicly criticizing
 the Government. Sometimes they are charged with "endangering
 state security" or with other crimes. More often they are
 never formally charged but are simply held in indefinite
 detention. The 1975 anti-subversion law permits indefinite
 detention without trial in cases involving national security.
 In August and September, several hundred persons were
 reportedly detained in connection with religious disturbances
 between Buddhists and Muslims. Most are understood to have
 subsequently been released. An unknown number of persons,
 probably several dozen, was detained following the terrorist
 bombing in Rangoon of the visiting South Korean Presidential
 delegation. And subsequent to the dismissal in May of the
 Joint General Secretary of the party and the Minister for Home
 and Religious Affairs, some of their suspected supporters were
 reportedly arrested or detained.
 There is no provision in Burmese Law for a person in detention
 to seek a judicial determination of the legality of his
 detention. The Government neither acknowledges holding
 political prisoners nor considers itself compelled to justify
 the detention or imprisonment of anyone. The number of
 political detainees is thought to have decreased since 1980,
 when there was a general amnesty. Some estimates place the
 current number in the hundreds.
 In common criminal cases, police may detain suspects up to 24
 hours, after which a court order must be sought from competent
 judicial authorities. These court orders, which are renewable,
 authorize extensions of the detention for 14-day periods until
 charges are formally brought before a court.
 Refugees and other stateless persons are regarded as illegal
 immigrants subject to arrest. If they cannot be repatriated
 after serving sentences for illegal entry, they may be detained
 indefinitely. The Burmese Government is thought to have under
 detention several hundred "illegal immigrants" from a number of
 Asian countries. Some of these persons reportedly entered
 Burma without documentation in hope of transit or resettlement,
 while others were born in Burma but cannot prove it. Some of
 these individuals have reportedly been under detention for over
 a decade. A handful of these detainees has been voluntarily
 repatriated.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Justice is administered by "Judges' Committees". These
 committees are elected from a single slate of candidates chosen
 by the party. Almost all judges are party members, and a large
 number are military officers, either active or retired.
 Although untrained in the law, they are normally advised by
 professional legal officers. The judiciary is not independent
 of the Government, which can influence both verdict and
 sentence, particularly in political/security cases.
 The Constitution provides for public trials in most cases, and
 this practice is followed in common criminal cases. In
 
 
 733
 political/security cases, special judiciary committees may be
 named by the Council of State. The public is normally not
 allowed to attend such trials.
 When both common criminal and political/security cases come to
 trial, the burden of proof is on the prosecution, and the
 accused has the right to counsel. Legal counsel is provided
 for indigent defendants if they are faced with a possible
 sentence of seven years or more. Normally, defendants can
 consult freely and privately with their lawyers, and defendants
 and their lawyers are made aware of the charges and evidence
 and are permitted to submit their own evidence. The verdicts
 of civil, security, and military courts may be appealed to the
 next higher court up to the Council of State.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 In common criminal cases, police officials are required to have
 a valid search warrant or be accompanied by a member of the
 local People's Council at the time of search. Search warrants
 are issued by local or state Judges' Committees. In
 political/security cases, security forces are not subject to
 judicial procedures and usually enter homes without warrants.
 Unannounced searches are sometimes conducted to insure
 compliance with laws requiring that any house guest be
 registered at the local People's Council office. These
 searches are known to occur in Rangoon. In areas of
 insurgency, forced entry and warrantless searches are carried
 out by government security forces and rebel groups alike.
 It is widely believed that security personnel monitor private
 correspondence and telephone calls as a normal practice. A
 well-developed system of neighborhood informers reports on
 dissent and criticism of the Government. The use of indigenous
 languages is not prohibited and private religious practices are
 not interfered with. There are reports that a few former opium
 poppy growers in insecure areas have been forcibly resettled
 to control illegal opium production gind improve security.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a.   Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution guarantees freedom of speech, expression, and
 publication but stipulates that the exercise of such freedoms
 should not be "contrary to the interest of the working people
 and socialism." In practice, opposition viewpoints and
 criticism of the Government are not tolerated. Party members
 can express some views about economic problems or bureaucratic
 failures, but outspoken members can be disciplined or
 expelled. Anyone criticizing the Government's leadership in
 public or private is subject to arrest.
 All mass media in Burma are government-owned and operated,
 including television, radio, and the six national newspapers.
 Newspaper editors are appointed by the Ministry of
 Information. Editorials must be approved in advance.
 Journalists are subject to strict guidelines as to what can be
 broadcast or published, especially on political matters.
 Criticism of government officials is not permitted, although
 cartoons and opinion editorials will sometimes criticize local
 administration indirectly. All forms of comunicationa --
 
 
 734
 domestic and imported books and periodicals, stage plays,
 motion pictures, and musical recordings -- are subject to
 government control and censorship. An indication of the extent
 of government control over public expression is an annual order
 issued by the Rangoon Division People's Council Executive
 Committee which gives instructions regarding the celebration of
 traditional Burmese Buddhist festivals. According to the
 order, dramas, plays, and other performances staged during the
 festivals must not contain dialogue and usage that would harm
 the dignity and prestige of the state and regional organs of
 power.
 The Government monitors academic inquiry in the social
 sciences. All research proposals by foreign scholars must be
 approved. The extreme difficulty of obtaining scholarly
 publications from abroad and of communicating with foreign
 scholars seriously impedes academic research in all areas.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Constitution guarantees the right of assembly and
 association, but only for those organizations permitted by
 law. In practice, most legal organizations are linked to the
 party. Party units and "mass organizations" for workers,
 peasants, and youth have been established at every
 administrative level. These organizations serve primarily as
 vehicles for communicating national policies and implementing
 government programs. Opposition political groups are banned,
 and their members are subject to arrest. Certain nonpolitical
 secular organizations, such as professional associations, are
 not under direct government or party control.
 There is no independent labor movement in Burma. Workers do
 not have the right to organize independently, negotiate, or
 strike. The labor force is organized into government and party
 controlled workers' and peasants' mass organizations. Most of
 the leaders of these organizations are party officials, and the
 national leadership is made up of ranking party and government
 officials. For example, the Workers' Organization National
 Chairman is also the Minister for Social Welfare and Labor, and
 the Peasants' Organizations Chairman is also the Minister for
 Agriculture and Forests; both are members of the party's
 central committee.
 Although Burma is a member of the International Labor
 Organization, it has been criticized by that organization for
 its failure to permit freedom of association. Burmese
 organizations, whether unions, professional organizations, or
 trade associations, are not permitted to maintain relations
 with such international bodies as the International
 Confederation of Free Trade Unions.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Burma is a secular state. Freedom of religion is guaranteed in
 the Constitution and widely observed in practice. The vast
 majority of Burmese are Buddhist, although there are sizeable
 Christian, Muslim, and animist minorities, especially among
 minority ethnic groups. In some areas there is tension between
 the Buddhist and Muslim communities, and violence between them
 occurred sporadically in various locations throughout the
 country in 1983. Several dozen persons were killed or injured
 in the violence and several hundred reportedly were detained.
 The Government has made a strong effort to prevent attacks on
 
 
 religious minorities in line with its proclaimed policy of
 religious tolerance.
 Under the 1982 citizenship law, ethnic Burmese, including
 indigenous minorities, enjoy political, economic and social
 advantages that are not available to immigrants and their
 immediate descendants. Although there is no official
 discrimination on the basis of religion, some individuals of
 mixed descent reportedly believe it advantageous to convert to
 Buddhism in order to benefit from the advantages of being
 considered ethnic Burmese.
 All religious organizations are required to register with the
 Government, and religious publications are subject to the same
 governmental control and censorship as other publications.
 In 1980 the Government appointed a National Buddhist Council
 which has carried out a "purification" of the Buddhist clergy.
 Under this program several hundred monks have been expelled
 from the monkhood on charges of personal misconduct in
 violation of Buddhist canons. In many cases the monks'
 offenses reportedly consisted of criticizing the Government.
 Buddhist ecclesiastical courts have also banned the activities
 and doctrines of several Buddhist sects judged to be
 heretical. In October 1983, the National Assembly passed a law
 which makes decisions of the National Buddhist Council
 equivalent to law and prohibits ousted monks from becoming
 monks again.
 Religious minorities are free to practice their religions,
 establish places of worship, and train clergy. The bureaucracy
 makes it difficult to obtain permission to build new mosques or
 churches in urban areas, but there is no official prohibition
 against doing so. There are no legal impediments to religious
 conversion. The Burmese Government discourages close ties
 between Burmese congregations and international religious
 bodies, but congregations are permitted to maintain contacts
 with their co-religionists in other countries. Religious
 travel by selected individuals to Mecca or to Buddhist shrines
 in India is organized by the Government. Foreign missionaries
 are generally denied permission to enter Burma, and visiting
 religious leaders or clergy are not permitted to address local
 congregations.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel,
 Emigration, and Repatriation
 The Constitution guarantees Burmese citizens the right to live
 anywhere in the country, although exceptions apply to areas of
 insurgent activity. Except for these limitations, internal travel
 by Burmese citizens is unrestricted, but they must inform local
 authorities of their temporary place of residence.
 Citizens wishing to travel abroad, except for official purposes,
 must obtain approval from the Passport Board. There are long
 delays in the processing of applications; and less than half of
 them are believed to receive approval. Although the Passport
 Board does not need to justify its decisions, it is apparent that
 political considerations are a major factor in some cases. The
 Burmese Government has been responsive to humanitarian appeals in
 a few cases.
 Private citizens normally must reimburse the Government for their
 university and professional education and pay income tax in
 
 
 736
 advance before traveling abroad. Non-citizens are generally
 unable to travel abroad legally, as Burma does not recognize
 stateless documentation for exit purposes.
 While no such policy has been formally enunciated, emigration is
 restricted because of the Goverment's concerns about security and
 loss of trained personnel. Legal requirements and bureaucratic
 procedures cause long delays, and the right to emigrate often is
 denied. Emigres are severely limited in terms of what they are
 allowed to take out of the country with them. Citizens who adopt
 another nationality lose their Burmese citizenship.
 Burmese Government policies severely restrict the return of
 emigres, although the 1980 amnesty permitted exiles living abroad
 to return to Burma. A number of prominent former politicians and
 some former insurgents took advantage of the offer. Emigres who
 left the country legally are generally allowed to return to visit
 relatives, although there are often delays in obtaining entry
 visas. Emigres wishing to return permanently are required to
 reapply for Burmese citizenship. In general, emigres who leave
 the country illegally cannot legally return under any
 circumstances.
 Burma does not permit foreign refugees or displaced persons to
 resettle or seek safehaven within Burma. The Government treats
 persons claiming to be refugees as illegal immigrants subject to
 arrest or deportation. In the late 1970's, the Burmese Government
 forcibly expelled over 150,000 alleged "illegal immigrants" from
 Bangladesh. Most were subsequently repatriated to Burma and
 resettled under UNHCR auspices.
 An unknown number, probably several hundred, of displaced persons
 or "illegal immigrants" has been under detention for years. These
 stateless persons entered Burma, often without papers, in hope of
 transit or resettlement. Among the detaines of Chinese origin,
 who constitute the largest group, some fled from China during the
 Cultural Revolution and have been under detention for fifteen
 years or more. Others are ethnic Chinese who fled Vietnam during
 the period of persecution of Chinese in the late 1970's.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to
 Change Their Government
 Burma is an authoritarian, one-party system in which leadership is
 drawn from a small elite within the military
 officer corps. All government institutions and other
 organizations in Burma are subordinate to the guidance of the
 ruling Burma Socialist Program Party. The party in turn follows
 the highly personalized leadership of Chairman U Ne Win, who has
 ruled and guided the formulation and execution of national policy
 for the last two decades.
 Political opposition is not tolerated, and opposition political
 parties are illegal. The party is used to mobilize popular
 support behind decisions of the leadership rather than as a
 vehicle to express individual or group opinions of the members.
 Membership in the party is open to all adult citizens who meet
 candidacy requirements, but only about seven percent of the adult
 population are full party members. Party membership is virtually
 a prerequisite for many government jobs.
 The party chooses a single slate of candidates for government
 offices. The Council of State report to the October 1983 session
 
 
 737
 of the National Assembly noted, however, that some party members
 had been nominated as official candidates, in opposition to
 individuals preferred by the party hierarchy. According to the
 party, it is a political offense for a person to be nominated and
 elected in such a fashion, and persons guilty of such political
 offenses cannot serve as elected representatives. As a result,
 the range of choice in selecting the single candidate at the local
 ward and village levels has been even further reduced. Although
 party nominees run unopposed, they must receive 50 percent of the
 vote to be elected. In some cases at the lower levels, the party
 nominees have not been elected, requiring the party to propose
 another nominee. In other instances, the people were required Xo
 vote again until the party nominee was elected. A citizen who
 publicly refuses to vote may be imprisoned.
 In Burma's party and governmental decision-making assemblies,
 votes are almost always unanimous.
 Ethnic Burmans dominate the political system although the party
 seeks to expand participation by Burmese ethnic minorities. Women
 are under-represented in the party and at senior levels of
 government, reflecting the military background of most of Burma's
 present leaders.
 Persons with a significant proportion of non-Burmese ancestry
 (usually Chinese or Indian) are barred from higher party and
 government offices and are asked to resign if their mixed ancestry
 is discovered. The national bodies of workers' and peasants'
 organizations deny leadership positions to members of mixed
 ancestry. The Citizenship Law of 1982 significantly limits the
 political, economic, and educational rights of many, primarily
 ethnic Chinese and Indians.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Burmese Government does not permit investigations of its human
 rights practices, nor is it willing to discuss human rights
 problem with outside governmental or non-governmental
 organizations. No Burmese organization, governmental or private,
 monitors the human rights situation in Burma. Burma also does not
 actively participate in international or regional human rights
 bodies. Amnesty International's 1983 report expresses concern
 about detention without trial and the use of coercion, including
 torture, to obtain confessions and information. Freedom House, in
 its report for 1983, classified Burma as "not free".
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 Burma remains one of the poorest nations in the world, with a per
 capita GNP of only $183 in 1981. However, Burma is rich in
 natural resources and is essentially self-sufficient in food and
 energy. The majority of the population has the basic economic
 necessities. According to preliminary figures from the 1983
 census, Burma's population was 35,306,189 and the population
 growth rate was 2.02 percent.
 Economic progress has been hindered by widespread insurgency,
 rigid bureaucratic structures and centralization, socialist
 economic policies, and lack of infrastructure. Since 1972,
 limited changes in government economic policies, successful
 implementation of high-yield variety programs in the agricultural
 sector, and an infusion of foreign aid have helped improve
 economic performance.
 
 
 738
 Life expectancy in 1980 was 53.65 years at birth and the infant
 mortality rate for 1983 was 93.20 per 1,000 live births. The
 calorie supply as a percentage of minimum established daily
 requirements was 103 percent in 1980, but only 17 percent of the
 population had access to safe drinking water in 1980.
 Education in Burma is free through the university level. Primary
 school enrollment in 1980 was estimated at 84 percent (87 percent
 for males and 81 percent for females), and the adult literacy rate
 in 1983 was estimated to be 67 percent.
 Burma's numerous ethnic minorities have their own languages and
 customs; many of them live in remote, insecure areas. Many of
 these people view efforts of the central government to exert
 control over them as a chauvinistic attempt by the ethnic Burmans
 to dominate them. Some have resisted this by resorting to
 insurgency against the government. Economic development among the
 ethnic minority groups has lagged, and many still live at the
 subsistence level.
 The Chinese and Indian minorities enjoyed a favored status when
 Burma was a British colony and dominated the country's economy.
 Since 1962 these groups have been discriminated against as the
 Government has attempted to return control of the economy to the
 ethnic Burmans.
