 KYRGYZ REPUBLIC
 A former republic of the Soviet Union, the Kyrgyz Republic (Kyrgyzstan), became
 an independent nation on August 31, 1991. The Jogorku Kenesh (Parliament) by
 unanimous vote adopted a new Constitution on May 5, 1993, defining Kyrgyzstan
 as a unitary democratic republic founded on secular principles and providing sub-
 stantial guarantees of the civil rights of its citizens. The Constitution provides for
 a government with three branches (legislative, executive, and judicial) presided over
 by a President who is the Head of State. Governmental institutions are in a transi-
 tional state as several constitutional provisions have not gone into effect, pending
 legislative elections scheduled for 1995 and presidential elections for 1996. In addi-
 tion, Kyrgyzstan's legal and judicial systems remain essentially unchanged from the
 Soviet period, although at the end of 1993 the Government began a process of legal
 and judicial reform.
 Although the Constitution changed the name of the legislature from Supreme So-
 viet to Jogorku Kenesh, members elected during the Soviet period continued to
 dominate this 350-member body. A reformer, Askar Akayev, was originally chosen
 as president by the Supreme Soviet of Kyrgyzstan in 1990. In October 1991, he was
 popularly reelected in a referendum-style election; he ran unopposed.
 The Committee on National Security (KNB) has inherited much of its personnel
 and infrastructure from the old Soviet Committee for State Security, or KGB. The
 KNB chairman is a member of the Cabinet. Unlike during the Soviet era, the KNB's
 actions must conform to Kyrgyzstan's laws. The KNB appears to be under the full
 control of the Government.
 The predominantly agricultural economy is highly dependent on trade with the
 rest of the former Soviet Union. The Government remains firmly committed to the
 development of a market economy, with favorable laws on privatization, joint ven-
 tures, and foreign trade and investment. With International Monetary Fund sup-
 port, the Government introduced a new currency, the som, in May in order to sta-
 bilize the economy, avoid the inflation of the ruble, and attract foreign investment.

 Since then, the currency has proved fairly stable, and monthly inflation slowed from
 40 percent to 10 percent. Foreign investment reached $400 million by midyear.
 However, industrial production continued to fall, and unemployment grew.
 The Government continued to express strong support for human rights, including
 freedom of the press, democracy, and the rule of law, and in general respected them
 in practice. However, concerns continued to be raised about government policy to-
 ward non-Kyrgyz ethnic minorities. In 1993 increasing domination by ethnic Kyrgyz
 of government, education, and other institutions and a language policy that favored
 official use of the Kyrgyz language created insecurity among members of ethnic mi-
 norities, primarily Russian speakers, and caused their members to emigrate in large
 numbers. In addition, Kyrgyzstan's legal and judicial systems remain essentially un-
 changed from the Soviet period.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Extrajudicial Killing.-No reports of such killings by government
 authorities or others are known to have occurred.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no incidents of disappearance or abduction attrib-
 utable to government authorities or others.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Torture or other cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment is not
 known to have occurred.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-For the most part, Kyrgyzstan's legal
 system continues to operate under the laws and procedures that prevailed during
 the Soviet period. The procurator determines who may be detained, arrested, and
 prosecuted and must approve all warrants. The Ministry of the Interior, the Com-
 mittee on National Security, and the General Procurator's office carry out investiga-
 tions. A person arrested or charged with a crime has the immediate right to defense
 counsel. However, in practice the accused often has access to defense counsel only
 after the case comes to trial.
 The Criminal Code permits the procurator to detain a suspect for up to 72 hours
 before releasing him or informing him of the crime he is suspected of having com-
 mitted. The accused remains in detention while the procurator investigates the case
 and prepares to present it to the court. Under Kyrgyz law, family members and law-
 yers involved in the case have access to the detainee. At the procurator's discretion,
 the accused may be kept in pretrial detention for up to 1 year. After the year has
 elapsed, the procurator must release the accused or ask the legislature to extend
 the period of detention. Since independence, there have been no known instances
 in which the legislature voted for such an extension. There is provision for bail, ex-
 cept for detainees under investigation for serious or violent crimes.
 According to official government accounts, approximately 1-2 percent of the prison
 population are pretrial detainees. However, nongovernmental sources believe that a
 more accurate number is 10-15 percent. In addition, these same sources claim that
 it is common practice for the police to hold people for a short period while making
 initial inquiries into the case before either officially charging the suspects or releas-
 ing them.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Tria.-The court system remains largely unreformed
 from the Soviet period. Once the procurator is ready, he brings the case of the ac-
 cused to court and tries it before a judge and two people's assessors (pensioners or
 citizens chosen from labor collectives). The accused and defense counsel have the
 right of access to all evidence gathered by the procurator. They attend all proceed-
 ings, which are generally public, and are allowed to question witnesses and present
 evidence. The court may render one of three decisions: innocent, guilty, or indeter-
 minate (i.e., the case is returned to the procurator for further investigation). Both
 the defendant and the procurator may appeal the verdict to the next higher court
 or to the procurator's office. However, the decision of a court to return a case to the
 procurator for further investigation may not be appealed, and the court returns the
 accused to the procurator's custody where he or she may remain under detention.
 The Government has recognized the need to reform the legal and judicial systems
 it inherited from the Soviet period. The reform of the judicial system is still evolv-
 ing. The Constitution establishes the judiciary as a separate branch of the Govern-
 ment. During the interim period, however, the courts remain under the auspices of
 the Ministry of Justice. The General Procurator's office has introduced the principle
 of the presumption of innocence of the accused. However, a deteriorating economy
 and a system staffed largely by officials trained during the Soviet period continued
 to impede reforms.
 
 
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 new Constitution prohibits unlawful entry into a home and states that a person's
 private life, privacy of correspondence, and telephonic and telegraphic communica-
 tions are protected by law. Current law and procedures require that the police, the
 KNB, and the Procurator's Investigation Bureau obtain the General Procurator's ap-
 proval for wiretaps, searches of homes, interception of mail, and similar procedures.
 Those personnel and organizations responsible for violations of the right to pri-
 vacy during the Soviet period have remained largely in place; however, no wide-
 spread and systematic violations were reported in 1993. ome citizens active in poli-
 tics or interested in human rights believe that the privacy of their communications
 was violated in 1993. Credible evidence to this effect is not available.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press,-The Supreme Soviet in 1992 passed a law on
 the press and mass media which establishes freedom of the press but also provides
 guidelines proscribing publication of certain information. The law supprts the right
 of journalists to work, obtain information, and publish without prnor restraint. It
 also guarantees a journalist's right to protect his or her sources. The law prohibits
 publication of material that advocates war, violence, or intolerance toward ethnic or
 religious groups. The law prohibits material advocating the overthrow of the con-
 stitutiona order. Desecration of national symbols like the national seal, anthem, or
 flag is prohibited. Publication of pornography is prohibited, as is propagation of false
 information.
 The law states that the press should not violate the privacy or dignity of individ-
 uals. President Akayev opposed a law that would have prohibited insulting the dig-
 nity of the President, and the Supreme Soviet did not pass it. The law requires a
 media to register with the Ministry of Justice and to await the Ministrys approval
 before beginning to operate. Since the law was passed, there have been no reports
 that the Ministry refused to register a publication or used the law in any prosecu-
 tions.
 During 1993 the press was free to publish material without prior government ap-
 proval or restraint and was frequently critical of the President and the Government.
 In August the Ministry of Justice attempted to initiate a process whereby press ma-
 terial would have to be screened for classified information prior to its publication.
 The press harshly criticized these efforts as a return to censorship. The Vice Presi-
 dent, acting in the President's absence, quickly issued a government decree revers-
 ing the initial steps taken by the Ministry of Justice and reaffirming the freedom
 of the press. Similarly, no prior restriction or censorship existed for the electronic
 media or cinemas.
 However, the Government owns all but one of the radio and television facilities,
 and Kyrgyz television remained tightly controlled. While a few fully independent
 newspapers and magazines existed, the Government continued to exert varying de-
 grees of influence over most other publications. Independent publishers said they
 were disadvantaged because they paid higher prices for materials and did not have
 some of the resources available to the government-owned media, such as office
 space. Government involvement in and ownership of much of the media raised con-
 cerns among journalists about pressure to self-censor. It is likely that in some cases
 writers for government-supported newspapers engage in self-censorship.
 In September a government press service statement accused a local ethnic Rus-
 sian journalist working for the Russian television network Ostankino of negative re-
 o      about Kyrgyzstan and concluded that it was unacce table that "a foreign
 urnaist insult the dignity of the people of the country vf his temporary habi-
 tation." The journalist, however, was bern in the capital, Bishkek, has lived in
 Kyrgyzstan for the past 30 years, and is a Kz citizen. He appeared before the
 procurator on Septembr 15 but was not charge. The local Russian-language press
 sharply criticized the Government statement for attempting to portray the journalist
 as a foreigner. In addition, the press pointed out that it was the journalist's high-
 lighting of th e   v  side of life in Kygstan that government officials resented
 and tried to suppress. President Akayev made a public defense of the journalist and
 criticized those officials for their handling of the case. The government press service
 defended its position but also assured the media that the criticism of the journalist
 had no implications for the media as a whole.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Assoeiation-Under the new Constitution,
 citizens have the right to assemble and associate freely, and they did so in 1993
 without government interference. Permits were required for public marches and
 gatherings, but there were no reportsa tthey were denied arbitrarily.
 The 1991 law requires all public organizations, including labor unions, political
 parties, and cultural associations, to register with the Ministry of Justice. In at-
 
 
 tempting to register, some organizations have encountered bureaucratic obstacles of
 the kind prevalent during the Soviet period, but ultimately all organizations have
 been able to register. However, charges that interpretation of the law on public or-
 ganizations was not evenhanded were credible. An organization of Cossacks applied
 three times before it was registered as a cultural and economic organization. Accord-
 ing to the Cossacks, the Kyrgyz bureaucracy resisted registering them on the
 grounds that they had no historical ties or connections to Kyrgyztan. The Cossacks
 also claim that they are still periodically called into the Ministry of Justice to de-
 fend their status as a legitimate social organization. The Ministry of Justice, on the
 other hand, claims that the initial version of the Cossack's charter contained a num-
 ber of clauses referring to it as a paramilitary institution.
 c. Freedom of Religwn.-There are no governmental impediments to the practice
 and revival of all faiths in Kyrgyzstan. Missionaries and evangelists are not re-
 stricted. All have access to facilities and are free to proselytize. For the first time,
 a Roman Catholic church opened in Bishkek. Members of the Jewish community
 have complete freedom to teach Hebrew and practice their faith. Construction of
 mosques has accelerated.
 The President and his ministers profess commitment to a secular government,
 with no official ties to any religion. However the preamble of the draft constitution
 which the President supported referred to R yryzstan's commitment to the "moral
 principles, national traditions, and spiritual vaues of Islam." Government spokes-
 men explained that this phrase was intended only to awaken moral and spiritual
 values long suppressed under Soviet rule. Nevertheless, this language raised con-
 cerns among members of other faiths and among those committed to a complete sep-
 aration of religion from the State. At the end of 1992, the Supreme Soviet voted to
 include a modified reference to "Islam and other religions" in the preamble and
 adopted the new Constitution in 1993 with this change.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Government stated its support for freedom of travel within and
 outside Kyrgyzstan. However, certain policies imposed during the Soviet period con-
 tinue to restrict internal migration and resettlement and impede citizens' ability to
 travel abroad.
 The Parliament passed a law in 1993 on citizenship removing registration re-
 quirements for residence. However, in practice citizens of Kyrgyzstan need official
 government permission ("propiska" or residence permit) to work and settle in
 Bishkek. Continued use of this law restricts freedom of internal movement. Home
 and apartment owners are legally restricted to selling their property to buyers with
 such permission. In addition, members of minority nationalities accused the Govern-
 ment of partiality toward ethnic Kyrgyz while continuing to restrict the internal
 movement of those belonging to other ethnic groups. They cite the case of ethnic
 Kyr yz squatters who continue to live in Bishkek without official permission and
 received government help to construct housing.
 Kyryzstan does not have a law on emigration. The administrative procedures
 used in 1993 permitted freedom of emigration without any evidence of discrimina-
 tion. Citizens who apply for international passports must present a letter of invita-
 tion from the country they intend to visit or to which they intend to emigrate. Insti-
 tuted during the Soviet period, this policy impedes free and unrestricted foreign
 travel. There were no reports, however, that citizens, after presenting such a letter
 were denied a passport or an exit visa. Emigrants reportedly were not prevented
 from returning to Kyrgyzstan.
 Kyrgyzstan has drafted an agreement with Russia to ease emigration for the
 members of the Russian-spaing minority. The draft presumes that resettlement
 is voluntary and provides or the establishment of migration services in Kyrgyzstan
 and Russia in order to facilitate a more orderly transition for the migrants. The
 agreement is expected to be signed in the first half of 1994. In 1993 approximately
 24,000 people immigrated to Kyrgyzstan, and 135,000 emigrated from it.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The ability of citizens to effect a peaceful, democratic change of government re-
 mains untested. Most of the 350 members of Parliament were elected in 1990 when
 the frt multiple-candidate elections were held. However, the Communist Party,
 with its monoply on power still intact, manipulated the elections to ensure the vic-
 tory of candidates it favored. New elections for the Parliament are scheduled for
 1995. Askar Akayev was elected President by the Supreme Soviet in 1990 and, run-
 ning unopposed, was reelected by popular ballot in 1991. As President, he may issue
 decrees that are binding unless a rogated by a vote of at least two-thirds of Par-
 liament. New presidential elections are scheduled for 1996.

 In 1993 women occupied several high-level government positions, including those
 of Chairman of the Constitutional Court, Ambassador to the United States, and
 Minister of Education.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The Government does not restrict the activities of local human rights monitors or
 the delegations and representatives of international and nongovernmental human
 rights groups that visit K zsta. For example, the Human Rights Movement of
 Kyrgyzstan was registered by the Ministry of Justice in 1991. It focuses on the ac-
 tivities of law enforcement and security agencies as well as alleged cases of discrimi-
 nation in the workplace based on ethnicity. The Kyz-Amecan Bureau on
 Human Rights and Law Protection registered with the Ministry of Justice in Decem-
 ber. The Bureau states that its goal is to bring to the world's attention the human
 rights situation in Kyrgyzstan.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Government expresses strong commitment to protecting the rights of mem-
 bers of all ethnic, religious, and linguistic groups as well as those of women. In a
 total population of 4 / million, some 52 percent are Kyrgyz, 22 percent Russians.
 13 percent Uzbeks, and the remainder include Ukrainians, Tajiks, Kazakhs, and
 others.
 Women.-The law gives equal status to women in Kyrgyzstan, and women are
 well represented in the work force, professions, and institutions of higher learning.
 In rural areas, women still seem limited to the roles of homemaker, mother, and
 wife. The press often reports abuse and violence against women which is frequently
 associated with abuse of alcohol. Normal law enforment procedures are used in
 cases of domestic violence. The Government has not initiated special programs to
 address these issues but is discussing possible measures. In Bishkek, there is a
 Women's Congress, which is headed by the current head of the Constitutional Court,
 a woman. The Conss meets periodically ro consider womens issues.
 Children.-The Government ado Pted in 1993 two laws, the Law on Education and
 the Conception of the Youth, which address children's rights. On the basis of these
 two laws, the Government is in the process of working out a comprehensive legisla-
 tive packet on the rights and welfare of youth in the K z Republic.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.--Complaints of discrimnation center on the
 treatment of citizens who are not ethnic Kyrgyz. This group, which makes up over
 40 percent of the population of Kyrgyztan, is often called the Russian-speaking mi-
 norty, although Russian-speakingUzbeks comprise about 13 percent of the total
 population. Members of this qup alleged discrimination in hiring, promotion, and
 housing. They complained that government officials at all levels favored ethnic
 Kyrgyz.
 Russian speakers pointed to ethnic Kyrgyz squatters in Bishkek who occupied
 land and were later wven government aid to build houses. They cited this as an
 example of a policy that favored ethnic Kyrgyz at the expense of other groups, in
 that the authorities provided direct financial assistance and allowed the squatters
 to bypass the propika" system. Russian apeakers also alleged that a ceiling" ex-
 isted in government employment that precluded their promotion beyond a certain
 level. The percentage o eth nic Kyrgyz at high and intermediate levels of govern-
 ment is much greater than the percentage of ethnic Kyrgyz in the general popu-
 lation. Ethnic Kyrgyz have replaced Russian speakers in many positions in govern.
 ment, industry, and education, and this development gives credence to perceptions
 that career opportunities are limited for those who are not ethnic Kyrgyz.
 The appointment of ethnic Kyrgyz to key positions in the judicial system has led
 to charges by non-Kyrgyz citizens that the system is arbitrary and unfair and that
 the courts treat Kyrgyz more leniently than members of other groups. Although
 there is no evidence of systematic discrimination, it may have occurred in individual
 cass.
 The 1993 Constitution designated Kgrz as the official language and stated that
 Russian and other languages used in the country were guaranteed preservation and
 equal and free development. However, many Russian speakers, particularly ethnic
 Russians and Ukrainians, still feel disadvantaged because they cannot speak
 Kyrgyz. The h    a calledn e Government to adopt a policy of bilingualism. The
 Government has not established a universally available program of Kyrgyz instruc-
 tion for adult non-Kehiz speakers, although some instruction is available In gen-
 eral, adults who di not speak the language did not demand Kyrgyz-languag in-
 struction. Currently, both Russian and Kz ar used in industry, education, and
 
 
 946
 the courts. Most ethnic Russians favor giving Russian equal status with Kyrgyz as
 national languages in the Constitution.
 People with Disabilities. -Handicapped persons are not openly discriminated
 against, but the current harsh economic conditions limit the Government's ability
 to provide equal opportunity for individuals with handicaps. Parliament in April
 1991 adopted the Law on Social Protection of the Disabled, which provides for acces-
 sibility for the handicapped, but lack of funds makes implementation of this law a
 low priority.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The law adopted in February 1992 includes provi-
 sions protecting the rights of all workers to form and belong to trade unions. The
 law requires a minimum of five workers to form a union. There is no evidence that
 government policy tried to obstruct the formation of independent unions. However,
 the Federation of Independent Trade Unions of Kyrgyzstan (FITUK), successor to
 the former official union, remains the sole trade union umbrella organization, has
 the same leadership, continues to manage the State's social fund, and retains pos-
 session of its previously held properties. The employer automatically deducts dues
 from employees' paychecks, which are then transferred to the trade union's account.
 It professes to be transforming itself from a passive recipient of orders from Moscow
 during the Soviet period into a genuine defender of working people. In 1993 FITUK
 was very critical of government policies and their impact on the workers' standard
 of living. Nevertheless, FITUK regards itself still as in a process of transition in
 which it is working out its relations with the Government, with the unions in other
 former republics of the Soviet Union, and with unions abroad. It remains affiliated
 with the Moscow-based General Confederation of Trade Unions, which succeeded
 the Soviet-era All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions.
 Nineteen of Kyrgyzstan's 20 union organizations are affiliated with FITUK with
 a claimed membership of 1.5 million. The exception is the growing Union of Entre-
 preneurs and Cooperative Members which as of October 1993 claimed a membership
 of 50,000. FITUK does not coordinate with the Union of Entrepreneurs and Cooper-
 ative Members.
 While the right to strike is not codified, strikes are not prohibited. In 1993 there
 were no strikes by workers' unions. However, the threat of strikes by teachers, min-
 ers, and medical workers was sufficient to induce the Government to address these
 labor groups' respective concerns by raising salaries. There were no retaliatory ac-
 tions against these groups, nor were there instances of human rights abuses di-
 rected at unions or individual workers.
 Unions are legally permitted to form and join federations and to affiliate with
 international trade union bodies. The new labor law called for practices consistent
 with international standards. Since independent unions were still in their infancy,
 no meaningful affiliation with international trade union bodies took place.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-A law passed in April 1992
 recognizes the right of unions to negotiate for better wages and conditions. Although
 overall union structure and practice remain consistent with the Soviet experience
 there is growing evidence of active union participation in state-owned and privatized
 enterprises. In the second half of 1993, leaders of the official trade unions actively
 criticized the President and the Government for the economic crisis and the result-
 ing drop in the standard of living for workers. In most sectors of the economy, the
 Government continued to set wage levels by decree, although many factories have
 begun systems of bonuses and other incentives in keeping with the Government's
 commitment to develop a market economy. The Government has no influence in set-
 ting wages in the private sector, where wages offered by employers are considerably
 hiherthan those paid in the public sector.
 UMon members are protected by law from antiunion discrimination, and there
 were no recorded instances of discrimination against anyone because of union activi-
 ties in 1993. However, because the old management/labor leadership continues to
 dominate the labor movement, those who wished to form an independent union
 faced formidable obstacles. This situation, along with a deteriorating economy, may
 have discouraged independent union activity.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced or compulsory labor is for-
 bidden by law and does not occur.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The minimum age for employment
 is 18. Students are allowed to work up to 6 hours per day in summer or in part-
 time jobs from the age of 16. The law prohibits the use of child labor (under 16).
 The police are responsible for enforcing the law; the Ministry of Education monitors
 enforcement. Restrictions on the use of child labor were largely observed. However,
 
 
 947
 the law is violated on occasion by small family businesses and more frequently by
 family farms.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The Government sets a national, legally man-
 dated minimum wage at a level that theoretically provides for minimal subsistence.
 The minimum wage at present is $3.50, or 32 soma per month. After January 1,
 1994, it will be $5, or 45 somes per month. In practice, even the higher median wage
 is considered insufficient to assure a decent standard of living for a worker and a
 family. The FITUK is responsible for enforcing all labor laws, including the law on
 the minimum wage. As the Government provided the overwhelming proportion of
 employment, minimum wage regulations were largely observed. However, enforce.
 ment of labor laws was nonexistent in the growing underground economy. Neverthe-
 less, market forces helped wages in the unofficial sector keep pace with official wage
 scales.
 The standard workweek is 41 hours, usually within a 5-day week. For state indus-
 tries, there is a mandatory 24-hour rest period within the workweek. Small private
 and family businesses set their own hours.
 The April 1992 law established occupational health and safety standards as well
 as enforcement procedures. Safety and health conditions in factories are far behind
 international standards. The deteriorating economy hindered enforcement of exist-
 ing regulations and prevented investment to improve health and safety standards.
 Besides government inspection teams, trade unions are assigned active roles in as-
 suring compliance with these measures.
