 CYPRUS
 Cyprus ha. been divided since the Turkish military intervention of 1974, following
 a coup d'etat directed from Greece. Since 1974 the southern part of the country has
 been under the control of the Government of the Republic of Cyrus. The northern
 part is ruled by a Turkish Cypriot administration. In 1983 that admninistrntion pro-
 claimed itself the 'Turkish Rpublic of Northern Cyprus" ('T RNC"), which is recog-
 nized only by Turke y. The two parts are separated by a buffer zone patrolled by
 the United Nations Force in Cyprus (UNFICYP). A substantial number of Turkish
 troops remains on the isad   nboth the government-controled areas and in the
 Turkish Cypriot community there is a generally strong regard for democratic prin-
 ciples. Glafcs Clerides was elected President of the Republic of Cyprus in 1993; in
 April 1995, Turkish Cypriots reelected Rauf Denktash as their leader.
 7Police in the government-controlled areas and in the Turkish Cypriot community
 are responsible for law enforcement. Police forces operating in the government-con-
 trolled areas are under civilian control, while Turkish Cypriot police forces are di-
 rected by military authorities. In general the police forces _of bth sides respect the
 rule of law, but instances of police abuse of power continued.
 Both Cypriot economies operate on the basis of free market principles, although
 in each community there are significant administrative controls. The government-
 controlled part of the island has a robust, service-oriented economy, with a declining
 manufacturing base and a small agricultural sector. Tourism and trade generate 22
 percent of gross domestic product and employ 26 percent of the labor force. In 1995
 per capita income was approximately $12,500, inflation was 2.6 percent, and unem-
 ployment was 2.6 percent. Growth in 1995 was 5 percent. The Turkish Cypriot econ-
 omy, which relies heavily on subsidies from Turkey, is burdened by an overly large
 public sector. It, too, is basically service-oriented but has a relatively smaller tour-
 ism base and a larger agricultural sector. In 1995 per capita income in the north
 was approximately $3,300, and inflation was 72 percent (down from 212 percent in
 1994). The economy in the north grew 2.7 percent in 1995.
 The Republic of Cyprus and the Turkish Cypriot authorities generally respect
 human rights norms and practices. However, deadly intercommunal violence flared
 in 1996. In August Turkish Cypriot police killed two Greek Cypriot demonstrators.
 In September unknown assailants shot and killed a Turkish Cypriot soldier. In Oc-
 tober Turkish Cyriot security forces, who again used unwarranted deadly force,
 shot and killed a Greek Cypriot civilian.
 In July a prominent Turkish Cypriot journalist was murdered in what was appar-
 ently a politically motivated killing. Police brutality contiued to be a problem; dis-
 crimination and violence against women also remained problems. Although the
 Turkish Cyriot authorities again took some positive steps to improve the conditions
 of Greek C~riots and Maronites living in the territory under their control, the
 treatment of these groups still falls short of Turkish Cyriot obligations under the
 Vienna 111 agreement of 1975. The Turkish Cypriot authorities continued to impose
 significant restrictions on meetings between members of the two communities out-
 side of the United Nations-contrlled buffer zone. Although they had earlier per-
 mitted most meetings inside the buffer zone, in October Turkish Cyriot authorities
 began denying permission for virtually all meetings. They said that they were acting
 in response to an effort by a Greek Cyriot parliamentarian to discourage tourists
 
 
 907
 from entering the north. Greek Cypriot women are still denied the right to pass citi-
 zenship to their children if they are married to foreign spouses.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-A prominent, leftist Turkish Cypriot
 journalist, Kutlu Adali, was murdered outside of his home in Nicosia on July 6 (see
 eion 2.a.). Police reportedly prevented Adali's family from entering their apart-
 ment for nearly a day following his murder, saying that they were searching for evi-
 dence. Turkish Cypriot authorities have not, however, so far conducted a credible
 investigation into Adali's murder.
 In August Turkish Cypriot civilian police shot and killed one Greek Cypriot dem-
 onstrator and participated in the beating death of another Greek Cypriot protester.
 During demonstrations on August 11, Greek Cypriot demonstrators throwing rocks
 entered the buffer zone after Greek Cypriot civil authorities allowed7 them
 unimpeded access. Turkish Cypriot authorities also allowed a group of Turkish Cyp-
 riot civilians into the buffer zone and may have even facilitated their entry through
 a restricted military area. One Greek Cypriot demonstrator was caught by a group
 of Turkish Cypriots, including three uniformed policemen, and clubbed to death. On
 August 14, following the funeral of the first victim, Greek Cypriot demonstrators
 again entered the buffer zone after government authorities once more failed to block
 tVheir entry. A Greek Cypriot civilian was killed by shots fired by members of the
 Turkish Cyriot police force, who used lethal force disproportionate to any threat
 posed by the demonstrators. The Government of Cyprus stated that it will press for
 legal action against the killers and issued arrest warrants for those it believes are
 responsible for the murders.
 In September unknown assailants shot and killed a Turkish Cypriot soldier man-
 ning an observation post.
 In October Turkish Cypriot forces again using unnecessary deadly force, killed a
 Greek Cypriot civilian who crossed die cease-fire line into the area controlled by the
 Turkish Cypriots.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Both the Constitution of the Republic of Cyprus and the basic law governing the
 Turkish Cypriot community specifically prohibit torture. The law in both commu-
 nities provides for freedom from cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punish-
 ment. Respect is generally accorded to these prohibitions throughout the island.
 In January the Government fired five Limassol police officers, including the chief
 of police and a senior officer, in connection with revelations that came to light last
 year that they had used torture to force confessions from suspects. The Government
 had originally planned to fire 12 officers but dropped its cases against 7 of them
 claiming a lack of evidence.
 Also in January, the Government stated that some Greek Cypriot police were in-
 volved in murder narcotics, gambling, and prostitution. The accusations were made
 in connection with the resignation of the assistant chief of police, Costas Papacostas.
 The Government has taken no further action on these allegations, however.
 The Republic's ombudsman issued a report confirming that police used torture
 against a suspected Turkish Cypriot drug smuggler, Erkan Egmez. Egmez was ar-
 restedin Oct6ber 1995 and tortured while in police custody. No official action has
 been taken against any of the police involved.
 In July the European Commission of Human Rights decided that the rights of
 Lefteris Andronicou and Elsi Constantinou had been violated by the Cyprus Govern-
 ment during a botched hostage rescue attempt in 1993. Both persons died in the
 attempt, which took place in the village of  oraas.   e European Commission
 of Human Rights referred the case to the European Courof f Human Rights. The
 Governmnt announced that it would comply with the verdict of the court.
 Parliament again failed to pass a proposed bill addressing police brutality; the bill
 was reintroduced in the fall.
 While there were no public allegations of police brutality in the Turkish Cypriot
 community, there are credible reports of pervasive police abuse of power and harsh
 treatment of detainees.
 Prison conditions are generally adequate in both communities. In August eight in-
 mates were injured during a prison brawl in Larnaca between Greek Cypriot and
 Iraqi inmates. A Council of Europe delegation visited Greek Cypriot jails in May
 but, in accordance with the Council's plicies, no report was made public.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exi/e.-Throughout Cyprus laws providing for
 freedom from arbitrary arrest and detention are respected by the police. Judicially
 
 
 issued arrest warrants are required. No one may be detained for more than 1 day
 without referral of the case to the courts for extension of the period of detention.
 Most periods of investigative detention do not exceed 8 to 10 days before formal
 charges are filed. Attorneys generally have access to detainees, and bail is per-
 mitted.
 Some abuses of power occur at the hands of the Turkish Cypriot police, generally
 at the time of arrest. Suspects often are not permitted to have their lawyers present
 when testimony is being taken, a right guaranteed under the Turkish Cypriot Basic
 Law. Suspects demanding the presence of a lawyer are routinely threatened with
 stiffer charges or even physically intimidated. A high percentage of convictions in
 the Turkish Cypriot community are obtained with confessions made during initial
 plie interrogation under these conditions. There are also credible reports that po-
 lice routinely abuse their right to hold persons up to 24 hours before having to go
 before a judge. Police officers use this tactic against persons believed to have be-
 haved in a manner deemed insulting to the officer. The suspects are them released
 within 24 hours without charges having been filed.
 Exile is specifically prohibited by the Constitution and by the basic law governing
 the Turkish Cypriot community.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The judiciary is legally independent of executive
 or military influence in both communities. Cyprus inherited many elements of its
 leal system from the United Kingdom legal tradition, includin   the presumption
 o innocence, the right to due process, and the right of appeal. Througout  prus
 a fair public trial is provided or in law and accorded in practice. Defendants have
 the right to be present at their trials, to be represented by counsel (at government
 expense for those who cannot afford one), to confront witnesses, and to present evi-
 dence in their own defense. There are no special courts to try security or political
 offenses. On the Turkish Cypriot side, civihans deemed to have violated military
 zones are subject to trial in a military court. These courts consist of one military
 and two civilian ,udges and a civilian prosecutor. Members of the Turkish Cypriot
 bar have complained that civilian judges tend to defer to their military colleagues
 in such hearings.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-Both
 the Cyprus Constitution and the basic law governing the Turkish Cypriot commu-
 nity include provisions protecting the individual against arbitrary interference by
 the authorities. A judicial warrant is required for a police official to enter a private
 residence. Turkish Cypriot police reportedly prevented the family of a murdered
 Turkish Cypriot journalist, Kutlu Adali, from entering his home for nearly a day,
 claiming that they were searching for evidence (see Section L.a.)
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-Freedom of speech and the press are provided
 for by law and are freely practiced throughout the island. The proliferation of party
 and independent newspapers and periodicals in both communities enables ideas and
 arguments to circulate freely. Opposition papers frequently criticize the authorities.
 Several private television and radio stations in the Greek Cypriot community com-
 pete effectively with the government-cntrolled stations. Turkish Cypriot authorities
 retain a monopoly over local radio and television, but a new, private radio station
 is operating in addition to two smaller, university-rn stations. International broad-
 casts are available without interference throughout the island, including telecasts
 from Turkey and Greece.
 In July journalist Kutlu Adali was killed (see Section l.a.). Adali had written arti-
 cles critical of Turkey's role in the north and particularly of the role of the Turkish
 military and of policies that allowed large numbers of Turkish workers into the
 north. Following Adali's murder, some Turkish Cypriot journalists have complained
 about surveillance anl intimidation. Turkish Cypriot authorities have not responded
 adequately to such allegations.
 Academic freedom is accorded wide respect throughout the island.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The freedom to associate, orga-
 nize, and hold meetings is protected by law and respected in practice.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-Freedom of religion is respected in Cyprus. Although mis-
 sionaries have the legal right to proselytize in both communities, missionary activi-
 ties are closely monitored by the  reek Cyriot Orthodox Church and by both Greek
 Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot authorities. Turkish Cypriots residing in the southern
 part of the island and non-Muslims in the north are allowed to practice their reli-
 gion. Restrictions on the right of Greek Cypriots resident in the north to visit
 Apostolos Andreas monastery have been eased. These Greek Cypriots may now visit
 
 
 909
 the monastery every Sunday and on religious holidays. An application to replace a
 retiri g priest is still pending.
 d. Fiedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-Tuddsh Cypriots and Greek Cypriots enjoy freedom of movement with-
 in their respective areas. For most of the year, the Turkish Cypriot authorities gen-
 erally approved applications for bicommunal meetings in the U.N.-controlled buffer
 zone. In October, however, they began to deny all applications for such meetings,
 citing the activities of a Greek Cypriot Member of Parliament. The Parliamentarian
 attempted to discourage tourists from crossing the buffer zone into the north. His
 associates struck at least one tourist and pounded on the cars of diplomats and oth-
 ers as they attempted to cross the zone. Turkish Cypriots who apply for permission
 to visit the south are required to justify their applications with ormal  ions
 to events arranged by individuals or organizations resident in the Greek Cypriot
 community. Many of these applications are denied, often without an official reason,
 although the basis for most denials is clearly political and related to the state of
 intercommunal relations.
 Turkish Cypriot authorities usually grant the applications of Greek Cypriot resi-
 dents in the north to visit the government-controlled area. The limit on visits to the
 south is 15 days per month. The applicants must return within the designated pe-
 riod or risk losing their right to return and their property, although this rule is
 rarely enforced in practice. Turkish Cypriot authorities also permit close family rel-
 atives of Greek Cypriots resident in the north to visit twice per month (it was once
 per month until July) and allow one overnight stay per month. As in the past, Turk-
 ish Cypriot authorities permit school holiday visits by children under the ages of
 16 (nale) and 18 (female) residing in the government-controlled area. Turkish Cyp-
 riot authorities apply generally similar but slightly looser restrictions to visits by
 Maronite residents of the north to the government-controlled area and visits by
 Maronites living in the south to Maronite villages in the north.
 Previously, persons of Greek Cypriot or Armenian origin, or even persons having
 Greek or Armenian names, faced considerable difficulties entering the north. In
 1995 the Turkish Cypriot authorities instituted a new policy under which third
 country nationals of Greek Cypriot origin would be permitted to visit the Turkish
 Cypriot-controlled areas. However, implementation of the procedures remains incon-
 sistent, and several persons entitled to cross under the new guidelines were denied
 permission without apparent cause.
 The Turktish Cypriot authorities since 1995 no longer require Greek Cypriots resi-
 dent in the north to obtain police permits for travel to Famagusta or Nicosia. How-
 ever, members of the Maronite community living in the north continued to need per-
 mits even to visit neighbongiages and are generally denied permission to visit
 areas in the north other than~orphou and Nicosia.
 Republic of Cyprus authorities permit oniy day travel by tourists to the northern
 part of the island. They have declared that it is illegal to enter Cyprus except at
 authorized entry points in the south, effectively barring entry into the government-
 controlled area by foreigners who have entered Cyprus from the nor. Following
 the March 1994 murder of the director of a Greek Cypriot association supporting
 Kurds in Turkey, the authorities placed significantly tighter controls on the move-
 ment of Turkish Cypriots to the areas under their control. Institutions and individ-
 uals sponsoring visits of Turkish Cypriots to the government-controlled areas must
 notify the police in advance and provide them with an exact itinerary.
 The European Court of Human Rights ruled in an 11 to 6 vote in December that
 Turkey had committed a continuing violation of the rights of a Greek Cypriot
 woman by preventing her from going to her property located in north Cyprus. The
 ruling reaffirmed the validity of property deeds issued prior to 1974. The Court also
 found in this case that "It was obvious from the large number of troops engaged
 in active duties in northern Cyprus that the Turkish Army exercised effective over-
 all control there. In the circumstances of the case, this entailed Turkey's responsibil-
 ity for the policies and actions of the TRNC." Under the Council of Europe, each
 side has 6 months to make submissions regarding compensation.
 In a similar development, the European Commission of Human Rights ruled that
 a complaint by the Government of Cyprus against Turkey was admissible. The case
 alleged that Turkey was responsible or the detention of persons missing since the
 1974 conflict and for depriving Greek Cypriots from the northern part of Cyprus of
 the use of their lands. The Commission's procedural ruling made no judgment on
 the merits of the case.
 The authorities respect the right to travel abroad and to emigrate. Turkish Cyp-
 riots have difficulty traveling to most countries because travel documents issued by
 the "fturkish Republic of Northern Cyprus" are recognized only by Turkey. Most
 Turkish Cypriots resort to utilizing Turkish travel documents instead.
 
 
 910
 Desite the absence of legislation, the Government of Cyprus regularly grants de
 fat       asylum. Cases are referred to the local office of the U.N. High Commis-
 sioner for Refugees for evaluation. There were approximately 60 such cases in 1996.
 If applicants are found to meet the criteria for refugee status, they are permitted
 to remain and are given temporary work permits. Applicants are not, however, gen-
 erally granted permanent resettlement rights on the grounds that the Government
 already has enough responsibilities in caring for those displaced after the 1974
 Turkish intervention. But they are permitted to remain until resettlement in a third
 country can be arranged. There were no reports of forced return of persons to a
 country where they fear persecution.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Multiparty political systems exist throughout Cyprus. Under the Republic's Con-
 stitution political parties compete for popular support actively and without restric-
 tion. Suage is universal and elections are helciby secret ballot. Elections for the
 office of president are hefd every 5 years and for members of the House of Rep-
 resentatives every 5 years or less. The small Maronite, Armenian, and Latin com-
 munities elect nonvoting representatives from their respective communities, in addi-
 tion to voting in elections for voting members. However, under the terms of the 1960
 Constitution, Turkish Cypriots may only vote for the position of the Vice President
 and for Turkish Cypriot Members of Parliament. As a result, Turkish Cypriots liv-
 g in the government-controlled area may not vote.
 e Turkish Cypriots elect a leader and a representative body every 5 years or
 less. In April 1995, Turkish Cypriot voters elected Rauf Denktash in elections
 deemed by observers to be free and fair. Greek Cypriots and Maromnites lving in the
 north are barred by law from participating in Turkish Cypriot elections. They are
 eligible to vote in Greek C riot elections but must travel to the south to exercise
 that right. They may also choose their own village officials, but those elected are
 not recognized by the Government of Cyprus.
 In both communities, women face no legal obstacles to participating in the politi-
 cal process. While clearly underrepresented in government, they hold some cabinet-
 level and other senior positions.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 There are organizations in both parts of the island that consider themselves
 human rights groups, but they are generally concerned with alleged violations of the
 rights of their community's members by the other community. Groups with a broad
 human rights mission include organizations promoting awareness of domestic vio-
 lence and others concerned with alleged policebrutality.
 There are no restrictions preventing the formation of human rights groups. Rep-
 resentatives of international human rights organizations have access thrugiout the
 island.
 The United Nations, through the autonomous tripartite (United Nations, Greek
 Cypriot, Turkish Cypriot) committee on missing persons in Cyprus (CMP), is en-
 gaged in resolving the missing persons dilemma that remained from the intercom-
 munal violence beginning in 1963-64 and the 1974 Turkish military intervention.
 The U.N. Secretary General has made continued support for the CMP contingent
 on evidence of a new spirit of cooperation between the Cypriot sides. In March Turk-
 ish Cypriot leader Denktash told an interviewer that some of the Greek Cypriots
 listed as missing since 1974 were killed by Turkish Cypriot irregulars after having
 been captured by the Turkish army. In August Amnesty International alleged that
 the rules governing the CMP were inconsistent with relevant U.N. instruments, par-
 ticularly the U.N. Declaration on the Protection of all Persons from Enforced Dis-
 appearance and recommend that the CMP be replaced by a U.N. commission of in-
 quiry. In response the U.N. clarified publicly that the CMP was not an organ of the
 United Nations, and the Government of Cyprus stated that there was no plan to
 replace the CMP. Also during the year, a U.S. team continued efforts to ascertain
 the fate of five American citizens of Greek Cypriot origin who disappeared in the
 1974 conflict.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 Legislation in both communities provides for protection against discrimination
 based on sex, religion, or national, racial, or ethnic origin. While such laws are gen-
 erally respected by each community, significant problems remain with the treatment
 of the Greek Cypriots and Maronites living in the north and, to a lesser extent, with
 the treatment of Turkish Cypriots living in the government-controlled area.
 
 
 911
 Women.-There are reports of spousal abuse in the Greek Cypriot community, and
 the problem is believed to be significant. A 1994 law aimed at making spousal abuse
 easier to report and prosecute has had little effect because key provisions remain
 unfunded and unimplemented. Many suspected cases of domestic violence do not
 reach the courts, largely because of family pressure and the wife's economic depend-
 ence on her husband. An organization formed to address the domestic abuse prob-
 lem reports an increasing number of calls over its hot line, although definitive sta-
 tistics on the number of incidents are not available. Very few cases tried in the
 courts result in convictions. There is little public discussion of domestic violence in
 the Turkish Cypriot community, although a report issued by the Women's Research
 Center described such violence as common. A women's shelter opened in 1994. Do-
 mestic violence cases are rare in the Turkish Cypriot legal system as they are often
 considered a "family matter."
 Throu   out    rus women generally have the same legal status as men. How-
 ever uner Turih Cypriot law, the man is legally considered to be the head of
 the family and can decide on the family's place of residence and insist that his wife
 take his name. Turkish Cypriot women are not permitted to marry non-Moslem
 men. While legal provisions in both communities requiring equal pay for men and
 women performing the same job are effectively enforced at the white collar level,
 Turkish Cypriot women employed in the agricultural and textile sectors routinely
 are paid less than their male counterparts.
 In the Greek Cypriot community, women face discrimination that denies them the
 ability to pass on citizenship to their children if they marry foreign spouses. Under
 existing law, only a Greek Cypriot male may transmit citizenship to his children
 automatically or obtain expeditious naturalization for his foreign spouse.
 In the Turkish Cypriot community, women face discrimination in divorce proceed-
 ings with regard to property acquired during the marriage. Divorced women also
 face a pervasive problem of inadequate awards of child support or nonpayment of
 child support. Legal remedies are difficult to obtain or enforce.
 Repub lic of Cyprus law forbids forced prostitution. However, there continue to be
 allegations that women, generally East Asian or Eastern European night club per-
 formers, are forced into prostitution in the Greek Cyriot ommunity. To date there
 have been few arrests since the women, fearing retaliation by their employers, gen-
 erally do not press charges. However, at least one trial was in progress by year's
 end. In the Turish Cyprot ommunity, there are an estimated 300 to 350 women-
 mostly from Eastern Eir   --working as prostitutes. These women often must sur-
 render their passports to the club owners and are sometimes prohibited even from
 making private phone calls.
 Reports on the mistreatment of maids are frequent in the Greek Cypriot press.
 These reports usually involve allegations that maids, often from East or South Asia,
 have been forced to work under inhuman circumstances. While these women gen-
 erally receive fair treatment when their cases come before the courts, many women
 do not file charges, fearing retribution from their employers.
 Children.-Both the Government and the Turkish Cypriot authorities dem-
 oiistrate a strong commitment to children's welfare. There is no pattern of societal
 abuse of children nor any difference in the health care and educational opportunities
 available to boys and girls.
 People With Disabilities.-In the Greek Cypriot community, disabledpersons ap-
 plying for a public sector position are entitled to preference if they are demed able
 to perform the required duties and their qualifications equal those of other appli-
 cants. In the Turkish Cypriot community, regulations require businesses to employ
 1 disabled person for every 25 positions they fill, although enforcement is ineffec-
 tive. Disabled persons do not appear to be discriminated against in education and
 the provision of state services. Legislation also mandates that new public buildings
 and tourist facilities provide access for the disabled. The Turkish Cypriot commu-
 nity has not yet enacted legislation to provide for such access.
 In August the University of Cyprus announced acceptance of its first legally blind
 student.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-Both the Government of Cyprus and the
 Turkish Cypriot administration have constitutional or legal bars against discrimina-
 tion. The basic agreement covering treatment of Greek Cypriots and Maronites liv-
 ing in the north and Turkish Cypriots living in the south remains the Vienna III
 agreement signed in 1975. This document provides for voluntary transfer of popu-
 lations, free and unhindered access by UNFICYP to Greek Cypriots and Maronites
 living in the north and Turkish Cypriots living in the south, and facilities for edu-
 cation, medical care, and religious worship. UNFICYP access to Greek Cypriots and
 Maronites living in the north remains limited. There are no Greek-language edu-
 cational facilities for Greek Cypriot or Maronite children in the north beyond ele-
 
 
 912
 
 mentary education, forcing parents in many instances to choose between keeping
 their children with them or sending them to the south for further education (in
 which case they may no longer return permanently to the north). Despite recent im-
 provements, Greek Cypriots and Maronites living in the north are unable to move
 about freely (see Section 2.d.) or to change their housing at will. Maronites living
 in the north also face a pervasive system of petty restrictions on their right of move-
 ment and generally lack public services available in most other Turkish Cypriot
 areas.
 In February the rapporteur of the Council of Europe's Parliamentary Assembly
 visited Greek Cypriots hi*gin the north. The rapporteur, the late Lord Finsberg,
 stated that he was *shockedfP by the conditions he found among these Greek Cyp-
 riots. In May a Dutch member of the same organization also demanded substantial
 improvements in the living conditions of Greek Cypriots and Maronites living in the
 north. Some Turkish Cypriots living in the government-controlled area face difficul-
 ties in obtaining identification cards and other government documents, especially if
 they were born after 1974. Turkish Cypriots also appear to be subjected to harass-
 ment and surveillance by the Greek Cypriot police. A number of Turkish Cypriots
 who work in the government-controlled area but do not live there, along with their
 employers, received anonymous threats following the killing of two Greek Cypriots
 in August (see Section L.a.). As a result, many of these Turkish Cypriots did not
 report to work and were dismissed. The Cyprus Government, which stated that it
 could not guarantee the safety of the Turkish Cypriot workers, undertook to provide
 unemployment benefits to those living in the mixed Greek Cypriot-Turkish Cypriot
 village of Pyla, located in the U.N.-patrolled buffer zone.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-All workers, except for members of the police and
 military forces, have the legal right to form and join trade unions of their own
 choosing without prior authorization. In the government-controlled area, police offi-
 cers also have the right to join associations that have the right to bargain collec-
 tively, although not to strike. More than 82 percent of the Greek Cypriot work force
 belong to independent trade unions. Approximately 50 to 60 percent of Turkish Cyp-
 riot private sector workers and all public sector workers belong to labor unions.
 In the Turkish Criot community, union officials have alleged that various firms
 have been successful in establishing "company" organizations and then applying
 pressure on workers to join these unions. Officials of independent labor unions have
 also accused the Turkish Cypriot authorities of creating rival public sector unions
 to weaken the independent unions. The International Labor Organization (ILO) has
 not yet acted on these complaints. There are no complaints outstanding against the
 Government of Cyprus.
 In both communities, trade unions freely and regularly take stands on public pol-
 icy issues affecting workers and maintain their independence from the authorities.
 Two of the major trade unions, one in each community, are closely affiliated with
 political parties. Both of the remaining major unions are independent.
 All workers have the right to strike, andseveral strikes, usually of short duration,
 occurred. In the northern part of the island, however, a court ruling from 1978 gives
 employers an unrestricted right to hire replacement workers in the event of a strike,
 thereby limiting the effectiveness of the right to strike. Authorities of both the
 Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot communities have the power to curtail strikes
 in what they deem to be "essential services," although this right is rarely used.
 Unions in both parts of Cyprus are able to affiliate with international trade union
 0       ations.
 b The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Trade unions and confed-
 erations bylaw are free to organize and bargain collectively throughout Cyprus.
 This right is observed in practice in the government-controlled areas, and most
 wages and benefits are set by freely negotiated collective agreements. However,
 Greek Cypriot collective bargaining agreements are not enforceable under the law.
 In the rare instances when such agreements are believed to have been infringed,
 the Ministr of Labor is called in to investigate the claim. If the Ministry is unable
 to resolve the dpute, the union may call a strike to support its demands. In prac-
 tice, however, such alleged violations are extremely rare; there were no reported in-
 stances in 1996.
 In the Turkish Cypriot community, where inflation exceeded 70 percent over the
 year, wage levels are reviewed twice a year for the private sector and six times a
 year for public sector workers, and a corresponding cost-of-living raise is estab-
 lished. A special commission composed of five representatives each from organized
 labor, employers, and the authorities conducts the review. Union leaders contend
 that private sector employers are able to discourage union activity because enforce-
 
 
 ment of labor and occupational safety regulations is sporadic and penalties for
 antiunion practices are minimal. As in the Greek Cypriot community, parties to a
 dis ute may request mediation by the authorities.
 ml export processing zones exist in Larnaca Port and Famagusta, but the laws
 governing working conditions and actual practice are the same as those outside the
 zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced or compulsory labor is pro-
 hibited by law, and this prohibition is generally observed.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-In both the Greek Cypriot and
 Turkish Criot ommunities, the minimum age for employment of children in an
 'industrial undertaking" is 16 years of age. Turkish Cypriots may be employed in
 apprentice positions at the age of 15. There are labor inspectors in both commu-
 ities. However, in family-run shops it is common to see younger children working,
 and according to press reports in August, children as young as 11 or 12 years of
 age were working in factories during their school holidays in the Turkish Cypriot
 community.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The legislated minimum wage in the Greek
 Cypriot community, which is reviewed every year, is approximately $484 (225 Cy-
 prus pounds) per month for shop assistants, practical nurses, clerks, hairdressers,
 and nursery assistants. This amount is insufficient to provide an adequate living for
 a worker and family. All other occupations are covered under collective bargaining
 agreements between trade unions and employers within the same economic sector
 and the wages set in these agreements are significantly higher than the legislated
 minimum wage. The legislated minimum wage in the Turkish Cypriot area, while
 subject to frequent review because of high inflation, is approximately $150 (14.8 mil-
 lion Turkish lira) per month as of mid-1996. This amount is not adequate to support
 a worker and family. Unskilled workers typically earn about $267 (26.4 million
 Turkish lira) per month, which is barely adequate to support a famil.
 A significant percentage of the labor force in the north consists of illegal workers,
 mostly from Turkey. According to some estimates, illegal workers constitute as
 much as 25 percent of the total work force there. There are frequent allegations that
 such workers are subject to mistreatment, including nonpayment of wages and
 threats of deportation.
 In the Greek Cypriot community, the standard workweek is an average of 39
 hours in the private sector. In the public sector, it is 3712 hours during the winter
 and 35 hours in the summer. In 1992, however, Greek Cypriot unions won conces-
 sions that reduce the workweek for most blue collar workers by one-half hour per
 year until 1997 when a 38-hour workweek will be in place for most sectors of the
 economy. In the Turkish Cypriot community, the standard workweek is 38 hours in
 winter and 36 hours in summer. Labor inspectors effectively enforce these laws.
 Greek Cypriot labor union leaders have complained that occupational and safety
 standards lack important safeguards. Factories are typically licensed by municipali-
 ties rather than the Government, resulting in an uneven application of environ-
 mental and work safeguards. A proposed bill to harmonize health and safety stand-
 ards with those of the European Union failed to win approval in 1995. It continues
 to receive widespread support and is exected to pass eventuall.
 Occupational safety and health regula ions are administere at best sporadically
 in the Turkish Cypriot area. In both areas, factory inspectors process complaints
 and inspect businesses in order to ensure that occupational safety laws are ob-
 served. Turkish Cypriot workers who file complaints do not receive satisfactory legal
 protection and may face dismissal.
