 MALDIVES
 The Republic of Maldives is a parliamentary democracy headed
 by a strong president. It is best described as an "emerging
 democracy." There are no political parties, and candidates
 for the unicameral legislature, the Majlis, run for office as
 individuals. The Majlis selects a single nominee for
 president, who is subsequently approved or rejected by the
 voters. All citizens over age 21 may vote. In practice,
 government control in this small, homogeneous society is
 exercised by a small elite with a common background and
 outlook, whose authority is generally and traditionally
 accepted by the population.
 The Maldives is a nation of 1,200 islands in 19 atolls
 scattered across an area 500 miles long by 75 miles wide in
 the Indian Ocean. The isolation of individual island
 communities from each other, and of the Republic as a whole
 from the rest of the world, is a dominant feature of social
 and economic life. It is one of the world's least developed
 countries, with nearly half the population engaged in
 traditional activities such as fishing, harvesting and
 processing of coconuts, and small-scale farming.
 The Maldives has not been subject to attack or invasion from
 outside for hundreds of years, and thus sees no need for a
 large defense establishment. The country's national security
 service of around 1,000 men is responsible for maintaining
 internal law and order, protecting the President, defending
 the country, and preventing foreign fishermen from encroaching
 on Maldivian fishing grounds. The police division of the
 service investigates crimes, makes arrests, and enforces house
 arrest.
 There was little change in the human rights situation during
 1986. Virtually universal adherence to Islam, the innate
 conservatism of a traditional society, and the high degree of
 homogeneity of the Maldivian people all underlie the relative
 absence of pressures for social and political change. The
 authority of the ruling elite is widely accepted and open
 dissent is rare.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There were no reports of political killings.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reports of disappearances.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 The Constitution stipulates that "under no condition shall a
 torture considered to be injurious be inflicted upon any
 person."
 Maldivians follow Shari'a or Islamic law, and occasionally
 convicted criminals are flogged. Usually, however, punishment
 is confined to less physical means such as fines, payment of
 compensation, house arrest, imprisonment, or banishment to a
 
 
 1232
 MALDIVES
 sparsely populated island where the prisoner must work to earn
 his daily keep.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The Constitution requires that "no person shall be apprehended
 or arrested, except on a verdict specified by Shari'a or
 (civil) law." There is no provision under Maldivian law for
 preventive detention, and incommunicado detention is not
 usually practiced. However, 40 youths reportedly seized
 during 1986 in connection with possible narcotics offenses
 were alleged to have been held incommunicado. There were also
 reports that a few persons were subjected to arbitrary arrest
 during 1986.
 Normal practice calls for the Attorney General's office,
 acting on information or complaints which it has received, to
 pass the case to the appropriate court. The judge then
 instructs the police to undertake an investigation. The
 suspect is questioned at police headquarters and may,
 depending upon the charges, be detained or placed under house
 arrest for 15 days while the case is investigated. If the
 case is not brought to trial within 15 days, the suspect is
 freed. Detention or house arrest may be extended after the
 first 15 days by authority of the President, but usually for
 not more than 1 month. While there are no provisions for
 bail, an accused.person held without bail who has valid reason
 to travel may receive permission to do so from the court
 handling his case.
 Actions which "arouse the people against the Government" are
 illegal and persons can be arrested and charged with violation
 of this law, the penalty for which can be banishment to remote
 atolls of the Maldives.
 Forced labor does not exist, except in the sense that persons
 banished to remote islands must work to earn their keep.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 There is a High Court and eight lesser courts in the capital
 at Male, each dealing with specific types of cases (e.g.,
 debt, theft, property claims). On other islands there are
 courts that deal with all types of cases. Judges are trained
 in Islamic law, are appointed by the President and serve at
 his pleasure, and thus cannot be considered fully
 independent. Cases in island courts that present knotty legal
 points are referred to the appropriate specialized court at
 Male, whose judge may in turn refer the legal point to four
 judges attached to the Justice Ministry for assistance. The
 High Court acts as a court of appeal and handles political
 cases, such as the trials of the participants in an attempted
 coup d'etat in 1980 and four Majlis members found guilty of
 bribery in 1983.
 During trial, the accused may defend himself and call
 witnesses. He also may be assisted by a lawyer, but there are
 few lawyers and lawyers are not provided by the courts. The
 accused is sentenced by the judge;.the length and type of
 sentence are established by law and custom.
 There is currently only one Maldivian serving a sentence of
 banishment for a crime which can be considered a political
 act. He is the only one who has not been pardoned among the
 several politicians convicted either of participation in the
 
 
 1233
 MALDIVES
 1980 coup attempt or of unconstitutional activities and taking
 bribes.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Constitution prohibits the opening, intercepting, reading,
 or making public of letters, telephone conversations,
 telegrams, and wireless messages exchanged between persons
 "except in accordance with the specific provisions of the
 law." There were no reports of complaints in 1986 that the
 Government monitors correspondence or telephone conversations
 or uses a regular system of informers. There are no
 prohibitions on the importation of foreign publications,
 except pornography, and foreign broadcasts are not jammed.
 The Government does not interfere with the right to marry or
 seek forcibly to resettle population.
 The Constitution also requires that private premises and
 dwellings be respected and states that "they shall not be
 entered into except under conditions and in a manner
 stipulated in the law." There have been no reports of
 practices to the contrary.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution guarantees freedom of speech and expression
 "so long as the specific provisions of Shari'a and the law are
 not contravened." Any citizen may criticize or complain to
 the Government without fear if he does so through recognized
 channels, such as by letters or oral complaints to the
 President, to a Majlis member, or to a civil servant or other
 person in authority.
 Maldivians are frequently frank in private when discussing and
 criticizing the Government. However, the law which prohibits
 arousing opposition to the legally established government,
 together with a long tradition of authoritarian rule, tends to
 make Maldivians careful when expressing their opinions to
 foreigners or in the media. There is no prior censorship of
 newspapers, but writers and editors are subject to prosecution
 if their articles contravene the law. In 1986 no writers or
 editors were prosecuted for writing antigovernment articles.
 There are three privately owned newspapers, each required to
 register with the Government. The only government-owned
 publication is the news bulletin, published by the Maldivian
 Department of Information and Broadcasting.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Constitution assures freedom of assembly and association,
 but Maldivians make little use of these freedoms in a
 political sense. The majority of rallies and meetings are
 sponsored or approved by the Government and commonly are
 addressed by officials or religious leaders. Clubs and other
 private associations, of which there are many, are permitted
 to function if they do not contravene Shari'a and civil law,
 and if they register with the Government.
 There are no trade unions in the Maldives, and workers rights
 to organize, bargain collectively, and strike are not
 recognized or protected by law.
 
 
 1234
 MALDIVES
 c. Freedom of Religion
 The Constitution makes Islam the official religion and all
 citizens are Muslims. There are no churches or shrines for
 the practice of any other religion. Missionaries of
 non-Muslim faiths are not permitted to proselytize.
 Conversion of a Muslim to any other faith would be a violation
 of the Shari'a, the law of the land, and would automatically
 result in the loss of Maldivian citizenship.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Maldivians are free to move about the country unless they are
 under house arrest or detention or banished. However, the
 Government discourages Maldivians from changing islands of
 residence, primarily because most recent migrants have moved
 to Male, which is becoming severely overcrowded. The
 Government reimposed regulations in 1982 that limit
 immigration to the capital island and its surrounding atoll,
 permitting migration to Male only for short periods in order
 to work, be educated, or receive medical treatment. At the
 same time, the Government has made a major effort to improve
 social and educational services and develop industry outside
 of Male.
 Maldivians are free to change jobs. There are no restrictions
 on foreign travel or on emigration, and there are no exit
 visas. The Government requires any Maldivian who has acquired
 another nationality to maintain Maldivian nationality
 concurrently. Such a person must enter and leave the Maldives
 on a Maldivian passport. As far as is known, the Government
 never has revoked the citizenship of any Maldivian. There are
 no refugees or displaced persons and no reports of Maldivians
 having been exiled or being refugees or displaced persons
 elsewhere.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of
 Citizens to Change Their Government
 President Maumoon Abdul Gayoom rules the Maldives together
 with a small group of generally well-educated members of the
 elite who are loyal to him. There are no political parties,
 although they are not forbidden by law. President Gayoom has,
 however, publicly discouraged their formation as being
 inappropriate to the homogeneous nature of Maldivian society.
 Members of the unicameral legislature, the Majlis, are chosen
 for 5-year terms by means of secret ballots cast by all
 Maldivians over 21 years of age. Candidates for the Majlis
 must be over 25 years of age, Muslim, able to read and write
 both Arabic and Maldivian script, in good mental and physical
 condition, and must not have been involved in a crime for the
 past 5 years. Of 48 members, 40 are elected (2 from each
 atoll and 2 from Male), and 8 are appointed by the President.
 There were 162 candidates for the 40 seats contested in the
 December 1984 elections. Majlis representatives are freely
 approached by citizens or groups with grievances or points of
 view on proposed legislation.
 Candidates for president must be Sunni Muslim, born of
 Maldivian parents, male, over 30 years old, mentally stable,
 and must not have been convicted of any crimes. A single
 nominee for president is chosen by secret ballot in the Majlis
 from as many candidates as are proposed by the members. The
 
 
 1235
 MALDIVES
 nomination then is confirmed or rejected in a nationwide
 referendum, also by secret ballot. In 1983 the Majlis voted
 47 to 1 to nominate Gayoom to a second, 5-year term.
 Maldivians confirmed Gayoom with 95.62 percent of their
 votes. At the time of his nomination and the referendum,
 President Gayoom had no serious challenger for the position.
 Some irregularities apparently occurred during the referendum,
 especially on outer atolls where island chiefs cast the
 ballots of all eligible voters on their islands.
 Nevertheless, Gayoom's leadership is believed to be widely
 accepted by the electorate.
 Since there are no political parties, factions in the Majlis
 tend to coalesce around individuals or points of view and vary
 according to the issue. Any member may introduce legislation,
 which, if seconded, must be considered by the Majlis. All
 laws must be approved by the Majlis. The Majlis has the power
 to question ministers and to call for their removal. In
 practice, however, the Majlis generally supports the
 Government, after carefully discussing and sometimes amending
 its proposals.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 There were no requests for outside investigations of human
 rights violations in 1986. There are no local human rights
 organizations.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 About one fourth of the Maldives' population of 181,000 lives
 on Male, the capital island. Despite the Government's efforts
 to develop medical facilities, and educational and economic
 opportunities in the more distant atolls, residents of the
 capital island have a higher living standard and more
 opportunities than others. Concerned about overcrowding in
 Male, the Government has restricted migration to the capital
 from other atolls, which results indirectly in discrimination
 against residents of the more distant islands in terms of
 their access to a better life.
 Women enjoy an equal status with men under Maldivian law, and
 patterns of behavior are not notably restrictive.
 By Islamic and Maldivian tradition, women play a lesser role
 than men in public life. No women were elected members of the
 Majlis in 1980; President Gayoom appointed one. There are
 three women in the citizens' special Majlis that is reviewing
 the Constitution. Women hold 15 responsible positions in the
 civil service. The President has appointed 2 women as aides,
 another to be his Director of Social Affairs, and 2 women to
 his 12-member Consultative Committee. In 1982, the President
 appointed a National Women's Committee which is seeking ways
 to increase participation by women in the country's life.
 CONDITIONS OF LABOR
 There are very few labor standards set by the Government.
 Only government workers are entitled by presidential directive
 to a paid annual holiday and free health care in the event of
 work-related illness. There is no minimum age for the
 employment of young people. The Government has set no
 
 
 1236
 MALDIVES
 restrictions on conditions under which children or young
 people may be employed, although most employers do not hire
 young people for work at night or in what are considered
 hazardous conditions. There is no national minimum wage,
 although the Government has established wage floors for
 certain kinds of work. There is no restriction on the number
 of hours per week an employee can be required to work, and
 there is no requirement that private sector employees receive
 annual paid holidays.
 Until the 1970's, most Maldivians either were self-employed or
 held government jobs and there was a relative lack of interest
 in workers' rights or organization. However, during the past
 5 years 3 sizable garment manufacturing facilities opened,
 employing large numbers of workers. There were no special
 provisions regarding workers' rights or treatment in the
 agreements to establish these companies between the Government
 and the foreign investors. However, a Department of Labour
 was formed in 1982 and it has been studying the labor
 situation in the Maldives and in other countries with a view
 to developing appropriate labor regulations for the Maldives.
