 SWITZERLAND
 Switzerland is a constitutional democracy with a federal structure and an inde-
 - pendent judiciary. The bicameral Parliament elects the seven members of the Fed-
 eral Council, the highest -executive body, whose presidency rotates annually. Be-
 cause of the nation's linguistic and religious diversity, the Swiss political system em-
 phasizea-Ilocal and- national political consensus and grants considerable autonomy to
 individual cantons.
 The Swiss armed forces are -a civilian-controlled militia based on universal mili-
 tary service for able-bodied males. There is virtually no standing army apart from
 training cadres and a few essential headquarters staff functions. Police duties are
 primarily a responsibility of the individual cantons, which have their own distinct
 police forces that are kept under effective control. The National Police Authority has
 a coordinating role and relies on the cantons for actual law enforcement. There were
 allegations of occasional abuses by police.
 Switzerland has a highly developed free enterprise, industrial, and service econ-
 omystrongly dependent on international-trade. The standard of living is very high.
 The-Government fully respects human rights, and there were no major human
 rights problems. However, there continue to be allegations by nongovernmental or-
 ganizations (NGO's) of occasional police-harassment directed against foreigners, par-
 .ticularlyoasylum seekers, an4 reports of verbal abuse against foreigners by private
 citizens. Some laws stille te   discriminate against women, although a new federal
 law came into force in 1996 thal is-'designed to promote -gender equality in the labor
 market. The' Government is continuing to take serious steps to address violence
 against women.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 Sa. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political or
 other extrajudicial killings.
 b..Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically .motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 .The Constitution proscribes such practices, and there were no reports of violations.
 SThere were allegations by NGO's and some individuals of occasional police harass-
 ment of forigners, particularly asylum seekers (see Section 2.d.).
 Prison conditions meet minimum internationalstandards, although some NGO's
 Tomplain of prison overcrowding. The 'Government has taken measures to improve
 prison conditions and address overcrowding.
 In April while attending the 53rd session of the U.N. Human Rights Commission,
 Nigerian human rights leader Clement Nwankwo was arrested and .reportedly sub-
 jected to physical and verbal abuse (including racial slurs) by police. He was accused
 of shoplifting and, by his own account, handcuffed to a table while stripped naked
 (ostensibly in order to examine him). Although no proof of shoplifting was discov-
 ered, Nwankwo was held for 4 days in preemptive custody without access to an at.
 torney,-tried without-legal representation, and sentenced to 20 days in prison and
 expulsion from the country with a right of appeal. The sentence was suspended.
 After his deportation to Nigeria, Nwankwo appealed his sentence, but no final s.l-
 ing-.has been made. The cantonal government took measures in response to the nci-
 *  dent, including launching an administrative inquiry into the. conduct of the three
 policeofficers involved. The police were given sanctions (reprimand and warning),
 which they have appealed. Special courses for the police in Geneva by the NGO, As-
 sociation corPrevention of Torture, are scheduled during 1998. Swiss NGO's believe
 that the case underscres the problems with polie treatment of foreigners, espe-
 cially asylum seekers in Geneva and perhaps elsewhere.
 On November 14, following its examination of Switzerland's third periodic report,
 the UA.'s Committee Against Torture expressed concern about "frequent allegations
 
 
 1315
 of ill-treatment" inflicted in the course of arrests and police custody and a lack of
 independent mechanisms in the Swiss cantons of certain legal guarantees such as
 the possibility, "especially for foreigners," to contact their family or a lawyer in case
 of arrest, and to be examined by an independent doctor on entering police custody,
 after each interrogation, and before being brought before an investigating mag-
 istrate or being released. The Committee recommended the introduction of mecha-
 nisms to receive complaints of ill-treatment by police officers against suspects and
 for the harmonization of the 26 different cantonal codes of penal procedure, "particu-
 larly with regard to the granting of fundamental guarantees in the course of police
 custody." In addition the Committee recommended that the Swiss authorities pay
 "the greatest possible attention" to the handling of cases concerning acts of violence
 attributed to police officers in order to ensure the opening of investigations and, in
 proven cases, the imposition of possible sanctions.
 The Government permits prison visits by human rights monitors.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The legal prohibitions on arbitrary ar-
 rest, detention, or exile are fully respected at all levels of government. The cantons
 are responsible for handling most criminal matters, and their procedures vary some-
 what from canton to canton. In general a suspect may not be held longer than 48
 hours without a warrant of arrest issued by an investigative magistrate. However,
 asylum seekers and foreigners without valid documents may be held for up to 96
 hours without an arrest warrant. Some NGO's alleged that the authorities arbitrar-
 ily detained asylum seekers (see Section 2.d.). A suspect has the right to choose and
 contact an attorney as soon as the warrant is issued; the State provides free counsel
 for indigents in most situations. Investigations are generally prompt, even if in some
 cases investigative detention may exceed the length of sentence. Release on personal
 recognizance or bail is granted unless the magistrate believes the person is dan-
 gerous or will not appear for trial. Any lengthy detention is subject to review by
 higher judicial authorities.
 A Nigerian human rights leader was allegedly abused by police in April, detained
 for 4 days without access to an attorney, and tried without full due process (see Sec-
 tion 1.c.).
 The Government does not use forced exile.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution provides for an independent judi-
 ciary, and the Government respects this provision in practice. The judiciary provides
 citizens with a fair and efficient judicial process.
 All courts of first instance are local or cantonal courts. Citizens have the right
 to appeal to a higher instance court, ultimately to the Federal Court. Minor cases
 are tried by a single judge, difficult cases by a panel of judges, and murder (or other
 serious cases) by a public jury. Trials are usually held expeditiously. The Constitu-
 tion provides for public trials in which the defendant's rights are fully respected,
 including the right to challenge and to present witnesses or evidence.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-Can-
 tonal laws regulate police entry into private premises. These regulations differ wide-
 ly from canton to canton, but all prohibit such practices without a warrant. All gov-
 ernment authorities respect these provisions, and violations are subject to effective
 legal sanction.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech
 and of the press, and the Government respects these rights in practice. An inde-
 pendent press, an effective judiciary, and a functioning democratic political system
 combine to ensure freedom of speech and of the press, including academic freedom.
 The authorities may legally restrict these freedoms for groups deemed to be a threat
 to the State, but no groups were restricted during the year. In addition an article
 of the Penal Code criminalizes racist or anti-Semitic expression, whether in public
 speech or in printed material.
 Most broadcast media are government-funded but possess editorial autonomy, and
 foreign broadcast media are freely available.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 these rights, and the Government respects them in practice.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for complete freedom of reli-
 gion, and the Government respects this right in practice. There is no single state
 church, but most cantons support one or several churches with public funds. In all
 cantons, an individual may choose not to contribute to church funding. In some can-
 tons, however, private companies are unable to avoid payment of the church tax.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-Under the Constitution and the law, citizens are free to travel in or
 
 
 1316
 outside the country, to emigrate, and to repatriate. Non-Swiss convicted of crimes
 may receive sentences that include denial of reentry for a specific period following
 completion of a prison sentence.
 Switzerland has traditionally been a haven for refugees, but public concern over
 the high number of asylum seekers generated pressure on the Government to tight-
 en its policy.
 Some human rights organizations have charged the authorities with abuses in
 connection with the implementation of a 1995 law aimed at asylum seekers or for-
 eigners living illegally in Switzerland who are suspected of disturbing the public
 order or avoiding repatriation. In particular, these groups have alleged instances of
 abuse, including arbitrary detention as well as denial of access to established asy-
 lum procedures, involving police at the two main airports. They also charge that po-
 lice officers used the law to detain or harass asylum seekers who are not suspected
 of having disturbed public order. However, the allegations of these human rights or-
 ganizations have never been substantiated, and these groups indicate that the situa-
 .tion has improved recently. Under the law, police actions are subject to judicial
 oversight, and the Federa Court has overturned many cases in which it believed
 that there was not sufficient regard for the rights of asylum seekers or other for-
 eigners.
 .The.Government cooperates with the office of.the United Nations High Commis-
 - sioner for Refugees and other humanitarian organizations in assisting refugees. The
 Government, provides first asylum and-prvided ito    approximately t2,700 persons
   veduring the yearoefugees hose l  andliprare rejected are allowed to stay tempeo-
 rarily,.if their home country, iszexperiencing waror insurrection.
 Section 3. Respect for PoliticalRights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The Constitution provides citizens with the right to change their government
 peacefully (at-local, cantonal,-and federal levels), and citizens exercise this right in
 practice through periodic, free,  and fair elections held on the. basis of universal suf-
 .-frage Ln. addition initiative and referendum procedures provide unusually intense
 popular involvement in the legislative process.
 Women were-,disenfranchised until 1971 at the federal level, but since then their
 participation in politics has continued tWexpand. Women occupy 51 of the 246 seats
 - in-the Parliament, 1 of T7 seats in the Federal Council (Cabinet), a record 25 percent
 -of the seats in the cantonal- government executive bodies, and about one-fifth of the
 seats in communal executives. In.1995-and 1996, however, voters rejected two local
 initiatives designed- to reserve a fixed percentage of elective seats for women. In
 March the Federal Court declared invalid another local initiative with the same pur-
 pose. A -vote on an initiative to mandate equal gender iepresentation in all federal
 institutions is scheduled to take place no later than 1999.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 All major international and domestic human rights groups are active and operate
 without government restriction.
 -Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution and laws prohibit discrimination on the basis of race, sex, reli-
 gion, language, or social status. The Government generally enforces these prohibi-
 tions effectively, although a few laws tend to discriminate against women.
 Women.-Violence against women is a problem. According to a government-funded
 study on domestic violence, one-fifth of all women suffer in their relationships at
 least once from physical or sexual violence, and about 40 percent suffer from psycho-
 logical or verbal abuse.
 The lawprohibits wife beating and similar offenses. Spousal rape is a crime in
 the Penal Code. Victims of violence can obtain help, counseling, and legal assistance
 from specialized agencies or from nearly a dozen hot lines sponsored privately or
 by local, cantonal, and national authorities. An estimated 700 women and nearly as
 many children took refuge in 15 women's shelters during 1997.
 The difficulty in gathering information about the number of prosecuted, convicted,
 or punished spouse abusers stems in part from the fact that legal cases are handled
 by each canton and data is often not up-to-date. According to police criminal statis-
 tics, 241 men were suspected of having abused women in 1996, and in 1995, 73 men
 were sentenced for such abuse.
 The Federation of Women's Organizations and numerous other women's NGO's
 have heightened public awareness of the problem of violence against women. Two
 government-supported women's organizations that fight for equal gender rights
 
 
 1317
 jointly conducted the first national campaign against violence in relationships. This
 campaign received extensive media coverage. No significant demonstrations or
 marches for women's rights took place during the year.
 The Penal Code criminalizes sexual exploitation and trafficking in women. The
 authorities effectively enforce these laws. In order to confront modern forms of traf-
 ficking in Women, especially via the Internet, the federal police increased the num-
 ber of their agents.
 Although the Constitution prohibits all types of discrimination, a few laws still
 tend to discriminate against women. In 1996 however, a new federal law on equal
 opportunity for women and men came into force. The law includes a general prohibi-
 tion on gender-based discrimination and incorporates the principle of "equal wages
 for equal work." The law also includes provisions aimed at eliminating sexual har-
 assment and facilitating access to legal remedies for those who claim discrimination
 or harassment. In March the Government adopted the 1979 U.N. Convention on The
 Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women, albeit with some minor
 reservations.
 At the aggregate level, men earn more than women, but it is not clear if this cir-
 cumstance reflects overt discrimination or other factors. Individual cases of denial
 of equal pay for equal work are subject to the new law. A revised labor law that
 would have eliminated special restrictions on working hours for women was de-
 feated in a 1996 referendum (see Section 6.e.).
 Journalistic reports of pre-1970's instances of forced sterilization of women led
 parliamentarians in October to ask the Federal Council to write a report on the
 practice as well as the legal, medical, historical, and social policy background of
 forced sterilization, in view of a projected tutelage law that is to include regulations
 concerning sterilization of mentally disabled persons. Forced sterilization was not
 ordered by the Swiss Federal Government. However, one cantonal government
 adopted such a law in 1928, which was abrogated in the 1970's. Women s organiza-
 tions apparently made no public statements about the reports.
 Children.-Despite the fact that the Government has no special program for chil-
 dren and that there is no special governmental office for children's matters, the Gov-
 ernment demonstrates its strong commitment to children's rights and welfare
 through a well-funded public education system and medical care. The federal and
 cantonal governments, as well as about 80 NGO's that defend children's rights, have
 devoted considerable attention in recent years to child abuse, especially sexual
 abuse. For convicted perpetrators of the latter, the law provides for imprisonment
 for up to 15 years. On September 1, amendments to the federal Penal Code came
 into effect, which provide for an increase of the statute of limitations in cases of
 child abuse from 5 to 10 years.
 With respect to child abuse abroad, the law provides for prosecution only if the
 act is considered a crime in the country in which it tookplace. Experts have pro-
 posed making such acts punishable in Switzerland regardiess of where the crime
 took place, but there was no action on the problem during the year.
 In March Parliament ratified the U.N. Convention on Children's Rights, which
 subsequently came into force. However, it included five reservations. The most im-
 portant reservation concerns children of migrant seasonal workers who are not auto-
 matically permitted to join their parents. Children of foreigners working as migrant
 laborers are only permitted to visit on tourist visas for a period of 3 months at a
 time. After 3 months, they must return to their homeland for 1 month.
 People With Disabilities.-There are strong legal prohibitions against discrimina-
 tion directed at disabled persons in employment, education, and the provision of
 other state services. Advocates for the disabled have called for new measures to en-
 sure greater protection for their rights, including easier access to buildings and pub-
 lic transportation. The Government, however, has not mandated that building or
 transportation facilities be made accessible. In 1996 a Member of Parliament pro-
 posed legislation to amend the Constitution to provide equality of opportunity for
 the disabled. The legislation has received broad support in Parliament, but it would
 be subject to a mandatory voter referendum, and there was no tangible action on
 the problem during the year.
 A 1995 law exempts disabled men from the tax imposed on those who have not
 fulfilled their military duty.
 National /Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-According to NGO statistics, which have not
 been verified, there were 33 reported attacks against foreigners in the first half of
 1997, compared with 41 reported for the same period in 1996. However, the num-
 bers appear to have increased in the latter half of 1997. These figures included in-
 stances of verbal and written "attacks," which are much more common than physical
 assaults. Investigations of these attacks are conducted effectively and lead, in most
 cases, to the arrest of the persons responsible. Persons convicted of racist crimes are
 
 
 1318
 commonly sentenced to from 3 days' to 3 years' imprisonment with a fine of up to
 approximately $27,210 (40,000 Swiss francs).
 In accordance with the first antiracism law, which was approved in 1994 (and
 which criminalizes racist and anti-Semitic actions or public speech), the Government
 appointed in 1995 a commission against racism. This group of experts focuses on
 preventive measures and serves as a mediator for conflicts between individuals. Ac-
 cording to NGO statistics, about a dozen judgments have been made thus far based
 on the 1994 law. The heaviest penalty was a 4-month conditional imprisonment.
 There was no documented increase in specific anti-Semitic actions, but there was
 a general impression, in view of the ongoing discussions over Nazi gold and the hol-
 ocaust era assets, that anti-Semitism increased during the year. Government offi-
 cials, including the Foreign Minister, spoke publicly against anti-Semitism.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-All workers, including foreigners, have the freedom
 to associate freely, to join unions of their choice, and to select their own representa-
 tives. The Government does not hamper the exercise of these rights. About one-third
 of the work force is unionized.
 The right to strike is legally recognized and freely exercised, but a unique labor
 peace under an informal agreement between unions and employers-in existence
 since the 1930's-has meant fewer than 10 strikes per year since 1975. There were
 no significant strikes during the year.
 Unions are independent of the government and political parties, and laws prohibit
 retribution against strikers or their leaders. Unions can associate freely with inter-
 national organizations.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-By law workers have the
 right to organize and bargain collectively, and the law protects them from acts of
 antiunion discrimination. The Government fully respects these provisions. Periodic
 negotiations between employer.and worker organizations determine wages and set-
 tle other labor issues at the national and local levels. Nonunion firms generally
 adopt the terms and conditions fixed in the unions' collective bargaining.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Although there is no specific con-
 stitutional or statutory ban on forced or compulsory labor in general, and on child
 labor in particular, such practices are not known to occur.
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment.-The mini-
 mum age for employment of children is 15 years, and children are in school up to
 this age. Children over 13 years old may be employed in light duties for not more
 than 9 hours a week during the school year and 15 hours otherwise. The employ-
 ment of youths between the ages of 15 and 20 is strictly regulated; they cannot work
 at night, on Sundays, or under hazardous or dangerous conditions. The Federal Of-
 fice for Industry, Trade,- and Labor- effectively enforces the law on working condi-
 tions.
 The Government does not specifically prohibit forced and bonded labor by chil-
 dren, although such prohibitions are implicitly included in the Labor Act. Such
 forms of labor are not believed to occur (see Section 6.c.).
 Government officials inspect companies that employ children after having received
 complaints. Every year a few employers are fined or receive conditional imprison-
 ment for violations of the law.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-There is no national minimum wage. The low-
 est wages fixed in collective bargaining are always adequate to provide a decent
 standard of living for workers and their families.
 The 1964 Labor Act established a maximum 45-hour workweek for blue- and
 white-collar workers in industry, services, and retail trades, and a 50-hour work-
 week for all other workers. The law prescribes a rest period during the workweek.
 Overtime is limited by law to 260 hours annually for those working 45 hours per
 week and to 220 hours annually for those working 50 hours per week.
 The Labor Act and the Federal Code of Obligations contain extensive regulations
 to protect worker health and safety. There have been no reports of lapses in the en-
 forcement of these regulations, but the degree to which enforcement is effective is
 unclear. The Government is currently overhauling the Labor Act, in part to
 strengthen provisions for workers' health and safety. The Parliament passed a re-
 vised labor law, but it was defeated in a 1996 referendum. A worker may leave a
 dangerous assignment without penalty.
