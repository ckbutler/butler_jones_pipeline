 SWITZERLAND
 Switzerland, a neutral and democratic country, attaches
 great importance to the observance and maintenance
 of human rights. The Swiss Confederation has an inter-
 nationally renowned human rights record. It is well known
 for its generous assistance to refugees. It is the head-
 quarters .site for important worldwide organizations
 concerned with humanitarian affairs, notably the Inter-
 national Labor Organization, the United Nations Economic
 and Social Council and the International Red Cross. The
 Swiss Government recently presided over efforts to update
 the Geneva Convention at the diplomatic conference on the
 reaffirmation and development of international humanitarian
 law applicable to armed conflicts.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a.   Torture
 Freedom from torture is guaranteed by law and respected
 in practice.
 b.   Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Freedom from cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or
 punishment is guaranteed by law and respected in practice.
 c.   Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 Freedom from arbitrary arrest or imprisonment is guaranteed
 by law and respected in practice.
 d.   Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Judicial power is exercised by the law courts, the
 independence of which is ensured by the constitution.
 Trials are fair and public.
 e.   Invasion of the Home
 Freedom from invasion of the home is guaranteed by law
 and respected in practice.
 2.   Government Policies Relating to the Fulfillment
 of Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care
 and Education:
 The high standard of living, high wages and the substantial
 sums spent on welfare by private industry in this society
 explain why public expenditures for social purposes are
 relatively low, in the European context. Education is
 free through the university level.

 Though large numbers of foreign workers were obliged
 to leave the country when their jobs were lost in the
 recent recession, Swiss policy now aims at gradually
 integrating the resident foreign worker community into
 Swiss social programs. One aspect of this process is
 their inclusion in the new nationwide unemployment
 insurance.
 Cantonal laws are gradually being revised to improve
 protection of individual rights and to harmonize local
 factors among the 25 Cantonal jurisdictions. A revision
 to the law on asylum has been proposed to improve the
 standing of refugees and more fully integrate them into
 Swiss society by providing eligibility for social programs.
 3.   Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a.   Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and
 Assembly
 Switzerland is a party to the European Convention on
 Human Rights. Switzerland prides itself on being a
 country of absolute religious tolerance. Religious groups
 have a right to the protection of the state against the
 domination of any other religious community. There are
 no restrictions on political expression or association
 except those placed on groups considered a potential
 threat to the confederation. No such groups are currently
 designated.
 Rights of linguistic minorities are respected. The
 establishment of the new Jura Canton this year expanded
 the scope of self-determination for the former French-
 speaking minority of Bern Canton.
 The law requiring universal military service for Swiss
 men provides no exemption for reason of conscience.
 This question is viewed with growing concern by Swiss
 citizens. The European Human Rights Commission recently
 heard a case on this subject. It found that due process
 is observed in such cases and did not criticize the Swiss
 practice.
 b.   Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel and Emigration
 There is freedom of domestic and foreign travel, and of
 emigration.
 c.   Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Switzerland is a constitutional democracy. Legislative
 power is vested in a bicameral legislature elected by
 universal suffrage. Women were granted the federal
 franchise in 1971. Over the past 8 years, women have
 made great progress in achieving equal status with men
 in public life. The proportion of women in National
 Parliament has risen from 5% in 1971 to 10.5% in 1979,
 
 
 669
 the highest percentage in any industrial western democracy.
 However, Swiss women in three small cantons have not yet
 been granted full voting rights for local issues. A recent
 report by the Federal Commission on Women's Affairs
 concluded that women are still under-represented in
 business and public occupations, although these fields are
 now more open to women.
 Switzerland has ratified the European Human Rights Con-
 vention and has expressed again recently its intent to
 ratify the U.N. Human Rights Covenants.
 There is full freedom of labor to organize.
 4.   Government Attitude and Record Regarding Inter-
 national and Non-Governmental Investigation of
 Alleged Violations of Human Rights:
 There have been no requests during the postwar period
 for outside investigations of the human rights situation
 in Switzerland.
