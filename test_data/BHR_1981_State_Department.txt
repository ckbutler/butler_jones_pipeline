 BAHRAIN
 A crossroads and trading center in the Arabian Gulf since
 prehistoric times, Bahrain is an urban, cosmopolitan
 society in which several ethnic, religious, and racial
 groups live and work. The country has been ruled since
 the 18th century by the Al-Khalifa family, which is
 predominant in the society and the government, but
 representatives of all major groupings fill policy level
 positions within the government. Ever since independence
 ten years ago, the prime minister has ruled while the amir
 has reigned. Bahrain is a tolerant society and offers
 religious freedom to its diverse communities.
 Bahrain was the first state on the Arab side of the gulf
 to discover oil, and the first to offer broad educational
 and social services to its population. The constitution
 adopted in May 1973 provides for an elected national
 assembly, labor unions, and strict safeguards for personal
 liberties. It commits the state to the advancement of
 social welfare. The amir dissolved the national assembly
 in 1975 and no definite steps to reinstate the assembly
 have been taken, nor has the constitutional provision
 permitting the formation of trade unions been implemented.
 Bahrain has been a predominantly stable and peaceful
 society, but there are some underlying tensions among its
 various ethnic and religious groups. The Iranian
 revolution has accentuated these tensions, and there have
 been some disturbances over the past two years, which the
 public security forces have quickly contained.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 Torture is forbidden by articles 19 and 20 of the
 constitution. While there have been a few allegations
 that detained persons are subject to torture by the police
 during interrogation, these allegations do not
 substantiate the claim that this is a customary practice.
 One person died while in police custody in 1981, however,
 and it was alleged that his death resulted from torture.
 There has been no official government reaction to this
 allegation. Other allegations of torture, cited in
 hostile broadcasts from Iran, appear to be without
 substance.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 The 1981 Amnesty International Report cites its concern
 with reports of ill-treatment. It called upon the
 authorities to initiate an independent inquiry into the
 circumstances of the death of the detainee mentioned in
 the preceding paragraph. There has been no official
 government reaction to Amnesty's report.
 c. Disappearances
 There were no reports of disappearances in 1981.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 The State Security Act of 1974 permits preemptive
 detention when police authorities have evidence of words
 or deeds considered detrimental to the nation's security.
 In practice, this broad provision has been interpreted to
 
 (936)
 
 
 937
 mean a serious and imminent threat to public order, to
 members of the ruling family, to diplomats, or to high
 officials. There have been some arrests without trial and
 arbitrary expulsions from the country. Imprisonment under
 this law requires a court order, and detention may legally
 extend up to three years. A detainee may appeal his
 detention and imprisonment to the supreme court of appeal
 after three months. The detainee may renew his appeal
 every six months.
 In early 1981, the security forces carried out a large
 number of arrests of suspects after a bombing incident in
 a crowded store. As many as 300 persons were detained in
 this sweep, but most were released within weeks, and the
 remaining detainees were expelled. An unsuccessful
 externally-inspired coup attempt in December also
 occasioned extensive arrests. The trials of several
 scores of persons accused of involvement are expected in
 early 1982.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Public trials are the practice in Bahrain. The
 constitution provides that defendants in criminal cases
 shall be presumed innocent until proven guilty and shall
 have the right to counsel. Trials related to national
 security, however, are held in secret before the supreme.
 court of appeal. There are no reports of such trials in
 1981.
 f. Invasion of the Home
 The constitution declares private residences to be
 inviolable "except in cases of dire necessity," as
 prescribed by law. The State Security Law allows homes to
 be searched in cases where the resident or occupant is
 suspected of posing a serious and imminent threat to
 public order, and after a court order has been obtained.
 There have been no reported violations.
 2. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 Bahrainis are free to express views critical of the
 government in private, but publication of criticism
 "directed toward the amir or heads of state of friendly
 governments, or which would tend to undermine public
 morals or public order" is restricted both by the state
 security law and by the 1979 publications law. The latter
 requires local journalists to obtain professional licenses
 from the ministry of information and gives the ministry
 far-reaching authority to censor local media and to
 control importation of foreign publications.
 A variety of Islamic and Christian sects maintain places
 of worship and freely practice their religion in Bahrain.
 Freedom of private assembly is guaranteed by the
 constitution, but the government prohibits public
 gatherings which it believes are a threat to internal
 security.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration and Repatriation
 Bahrainis are free to move within the country, to travel
 abroad, and to emigrate. The constitution prohibits exile
 as a form of punishment. There is no known impediment to
 the right of a Bahraini citizen abroad to return to
 
 
 938
 -Bahrain. Refugees, either from Bahrain or seeking to
 enter Bahrain, have not been an issue. Although in 1981
 Bahrain does not appear to have participated in major
 refugee relief and resettlement programs, it has in past
 years accepted refugees when possible. It has this year
 contributed to international refugee relief programs such
 as UNRWA, UNICEF, Afghanistan relief, and the Red Crescent
 Society.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 The amir dissolved the Bahraini legislature in 1975 after
 20 months, because of a threat to the national security
 stemming from allegations of subversive activity by some
 assembly members. Citizens enjoy relatively easy access
 to government leaders and to the amir, whose twice-weekly
 majlis (audience) is open to all Bahrainis.
 Late in 1980, Bahrain established a national women's
 committee, on which serve female representatives of
 various ministries and a number of women's and social
 welfare organizations. women in senior positions include
 the director of museums and antiquities of the ministry of
 information, the deputy director of social affairs of the
 ministry of labor and social affairs, one of two first
 secretaries of the ministry of foreign affairs, and the
 director of general education of the ministry of
 education. The number of female attorneys, physicians,
 and members of other learned professions is increasing
 steadily. The first Bahraini female electrical engineer
 recently joined the ministry of works, electricity and
 water.
 Although the constitution of 1973 recognizes the right of
 workers to organize, unions and strikes remain illegal in
 Bahrain. The last round of strikes, touched off by wage
 demands during rapid inflation, was in 1974. Those
 strikes tended to focus on wages and working conditions,
 but they also displayed a poltical dimension which the
 government considered destabilizing. The government moved
 with force against the strikers, arresting, jailing and,
 reportedly, deporting some non-citizen leaders. A small
 number were detained without trial for some years (up to
 five or six) but have now been released.
 The government steadfastly has refused to permit the
 establishment of trade unions, but it has permitted the
 formation of elected "workers' committees" in individual
 industries. Their representatives are enpowered to
 bargain with management on wages and working conditions,
 with unresolved differences arbitrated by the ministry of
 labor and social affairs. Only ten percent of employed
 Bahrainis are enrolled in these committees; expatriate
 workers (over one-third of the work force) are excluded.
 3. Government Attitude and Record Regarding International
 and Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged violations
 of Human Rights
 There have been no known international requests for
 investigations related to human rights in Bahrain during
 1981.
 4. Economic and Social Circumstances
 Beginning with its first oil income forty years ago, the
 government implemented generous social policies in health
 care and education. Free public health care is available
 to all citizens and residents. Secondary education is
 
 
 939
 free to all; the three institutions of higher learning
 charge only a nominal fee, and generous scholarships for
 citizens are provided for advanced study abroad. The
 government subsidizes basic food prices and provides
 public housing for low and middle income families. Social
 security programs are extensive and in the process of
 expansion.
 The government, faced with declining oil resources,
 receives budgetary support and project grants from Saudi
 Arabia, Kuwait, and the United Arab Emirates. Per capita
 income in 1980 was $6,315. Virtually no taxes are
 imposed, and public funds are distributed equitably.
 Budget allocations for 1980-81 included for education,
 10.39 percent; health, 8.24 percent; and housing, 9.7
 percent. Thus, approximately 28.36 percent of the total
 budget was devoted to social services.
 The right to private property is protected. Foreigners,
 other than citizens of other gulf Arab states, are not
 normally permitted to own real estate in Bahrain.
 Foreigners may possess other personal property, and their
 rights are protected under law. Public housing programs
 make land available to Bahraini families on easy terms.
 Although the government's emphasis on Bahrainization has
 swelled the ranks of Bahraini workers, foreigners continue
 to constitute more than one-third of the work force. The
 annual population growth figure of 4.0 percent does not
 accurately reflect the rate of growth of the indigenous
 population, since it includes the influx of temporary
 workers. A scheme to train 10,000 Bahrainis over the next
 ten years has been initiated. It is designed to upgrade
 Bahraini skills and make practical the Bahrainization of
 positions in private industry and government now held by
 foreigners. A problem unique to Bahrain among the gulf
 states is that educated and highly trained Bahrainis are
 siphoned off by other gulf states, which can afford to pay
 them larger salaries.
 In 1980, 54 percent of Bahraini males and 46 percent of its
 females between the ages of seven and fourteen attended
 school. Bahrain's current literacy rate is estimated by
 the ministry of education to be 40 percent. A major focus
 of the ministry's activities has been adult literacy and
 education programs.
 Rights to a standard of living adequate for health and
 well-being are well-protected for all citizens, given the
 extensive public health system, universal access to
 education, and housing and land subsidies. Many benefits,
 as noted, have been extended to include non-citizens as
 well.
 Currently, Bahraini women make up eight percent of the
 work force. Because Bahrain is a traditional society in
 which few women have worked outside the home, the
 government has enacted special labor laws to encourage
 female entry into the labor force. Women are granted
 sixty days' paid maternity leave and are entitled to
 nursing periods during the work day. It is illegal in
 Bahrain to discharge a woman for marriage or pregnancy.
