 FIJI
 Fiji is a multiracial society with a population of 715,000
 (July 1986) comprised of indigenous Melanesians/Polynesians
 (46 percent), ethnic Indians (48 percent), and Europeans,
 Chinese, and other Pacific Islanders (6 percent). It has a
 bicameral parliamentary system inherited from the British
 colonial period which ended in 1970. Its Constitution
 provides safeguards to protect traditional communal social
 systems, including land tenure rights of the indigenous
 Fijians. The individual civil and political rights of Fiji's
 citizens are protected by law, a court system which functions
 effectively and rapidly, a free press, free democratic
 elections, and a government which supports cultural
 diversity. Basic human rights such as free association and
 the right to own private property are enshrined in law and
 observed in practice. Fiji is a developing country whose main
 industries are sugar refining and tourism. Industrial
 development is proceeding primarily through the expansion of
 light manufacturing. During 1986 Fiji continued its excellent
 human rights performance.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There were no politically motivated killings by the Government
 or opposition political organizations.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no disappearances nor was there any evidence of
 people being abducted, secretly arrested, or clandestinely
 detained.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Torture, prohibited by law under the Constitution, is not
 practiced. Cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or
 punishment is illegal and is neither condoned nor practiced.
 There are no summary executions. Treatment of prisoners is
 impartial and humane. In addition to constitutional
 prohibitions, Legal Notice No. 51 contains specific
 regulations on treatment, visiting rights, clothing, etc.,
 which are respected in practice. Prisons remain overcrowded,
 but prisoners can serve their time and live outside the prison
 environment for the last 12 months of sentence and for any
 sentence of 12 months or less. Legislation also allows for
 gainful employment, in addition to a commitment to perform
 public work, while serving extramural sentences. Public
 defenders are available, and the Fiji Red Cross has access to
 detainees.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Habeas corpus exists and is honored in practice, and there is
 no preventive detention. In addition to constitutional
 safeguards, Legal Notice No. 14 establishes detailed rules to
 be followed by the police during arrests. A suspect can be
 held no more than 24 hours without charge following arrest.
 Exile is not practiced.

 FIJI
 Fiji does not permit the use of forced or compulsory labor,
 and there have been no reports of either practice.
 e. Denial. of Fair Public Trial
 Public trial is guaranteed by law and honored in practice.
 Defendants are entitled to counsel, and counselors have free
 access to defendants. Defendants are made fully aware of the
 charges brought against them, and they and their lawyers have
 access-to the evidence upon which charges are based. Fiji's
 courts are independent of executive or military control.
 There are no special courts, and civilians are not tried by
 military courts. Eiji has no political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The sanctity of the home is respected. Warrants issued by a
 magistrate are required for officials to enter a private
 residence. There is no arbitrary intrusion by the State or
 political organizations into private life.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Freedoms of speech and press are guaranteed by the
 Constitution and observed in practice. The press is free and
 private and not censored or controlled by the Government.
 However, Fiji inherited an ordinance from the colonial
 administration which allows the Government to order a
 correction in the press if the Government believes it has been
 misrepresented. This ordinance, though very seldom used, is
 resented by the press since it requires giving equal space and
 equal placement to the Government's statement. There is no
 interference with academic inquiry.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 There are no impediments to assembly or to freedom of
 association, although an ordinance requires obtaining a permit
 1 week in advance of any picketing or public demonstration.
 Fiji has an active trade union movement, which has the right
 to organize, strike, bargain collectively, and lobby; these
 rights were exercised freely in 1986. Fiji's 50 trade unions
 have about 45,000 members. Unions must give a 28-day notice
 of intent before going out on strike in the public sector.
 Fiji's largest trade union confederation is associated with
 the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 All religions are tolerated and allowed to practice freely.
 There is no dominant religion in Fiji, nor is any singled out
 for discrimination. Evangelical religions are free to seek
 converts and actively do so.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 All Fiji citizens are free to travel anywhere within the
 country and abroad. There are no restrictions on
 repatriation. There are no displaced persons in Fiji.

 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Fiji's political structure is designed to accommodate the
 special interests of the ethnic Fijians and of the ethnic
 Indian community. Election to the House of Representatives is
 on the basis of communal and national rolls. House elections
 are free and democratic, and many parties contest the seats.
 In Fiji's most recent national elections, 84.4 percent of the
 voting age population participated. Members of the Senate are
 appointed by the Fiji Council of Chiefs, the Prime Minister,
 and the leader of the opposition.
 Fiji's court system has tried, and in some cases convicted,
 persons charged with voting fraud, including a member of the
 governing party.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 There have been no reported allegations of human rights
 violations by the Fiji Government nor any known requests for
 investigations. Fiji's Ombudsman investigates complaints
 against the Government while maintaining the confidentiality
 of the complainant. A free, independent, and competitive
 press also serves as a watchdog for human rights. There are
 no adverse consequences associated with actions of either of
 these institutions.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 The Government neither condones nor encourages discrimination
 based on sex, race, or religion. The Constitution states that
 "every person in Fiji is entitled to the fundamental rights
 and freedoms of the individual, that is to say, the right
 regardless of race, place of origin, political opinions,
 color, creed or sex...". There is a growing awareness among
 women of both the Fijian and Indian communities of their right
 to participate more actively in social and political
 endeavors. However, women in rural areas continue to fulfill
 the traditional roles of village life and few women hold
 high-level business or political positions. Tribal
 inheritance is usually based on a patriarchal system. Women
 can and do, however, inherit status as chiefs; Fiji's third
 highest ranking chief is a woman.
 About 85 percent of the land in Fiji is owned communally by
 the indigenous Fijian people (46 percent of the population).
 Freehold land title is not an indigenous concept; current
 freehold land was alienated from the customary owners during
 the colonial period. Approximately 6 percent is government
 land, leaving less than 10 percent as freehold land. Communal
 and government lands can be leased but not sold; only freehold
 land can be purchased outright. The arrangement regarding
 land ownership was instituted to protect the interests of
 indigenous Fijians from the more economically competitive
 Indo-Fijians, but some of the latter consider it
 discriminatory and an interference with their own freedom to
 develop. Some members of the Indian community also complain
 that it is difficult for them to obtain government-backed
 financing for investment projects.

 Indo-Fijians have generally experienced greater success in the
 pursuit of educational studies and in the accumulation of
 wealth through investment in private enterprise. Most
 businesses in Fiji are owned and operated by Indo-Fijians, and
 they are more heavily represented in the civil service. Some
 indigenous Fijians view the concentration of Indo-Fijians in
 business and government as discriminatory to their own racial
 group.
 CONDITIONS OF LABOR
 Worker rights in Fiji are protected under several pieces of
 industrial legislation. No child under age 12 may be employed
 in any capacity. Children (persons under age 15) and "young
 persons" (age 15-17) may not be employed in industry or in
 attendance on machinery. With some exceptions, women and
 young persons may not be employed in industry between 6 p.m.
 and 6 a.m. There is no national minimum wage; however,
 several statutory and nonstatutory bodies have been
 established to set minimum wages by sector. Fiji's employment
 act protects workers from summary dismissal without just
 cause.
 A Workmen's Compensation Act and an Accident Compensation Plan
 have been enacted to set safety standards in the workplace and
 establish guidelines for compensation for workers injured on
 the job. Some unions in Fiji have criticized employers and
 the Government for failing to take action to remedy unsafe
 working conditions after they have been notified of them by
 the unions. The majority of such allegations have been made
 in connection with Fiji's sugar industry, the largest and most
 "industrialized" sector of the economy.
