 BARBADOS
 Barbados, a member of the British Commonwealth, is a
 constitutional democracy. Its House of Assembly is the third
 oldest elected body in the Western Hemisphere. It enjoys a
 free, two-party democratic system of the government modeled on
 the British System. The Prime Minister is the Head of
 Government.
 The Royal Barbados Police Force insures public order; it
 respects the constitutional and legal guarantees of human
 rights. The quality of its personnel and training has
 improved in recent years, and morale is good. A
 well-established legal system modeled after the British system
 provides due process and other legal safeguards.
 In 1984, per capita GNP in Barbados was $2,900. The mainstays
 of the economy are light manufacturing, tourism, services, and
 sugar.
 In 1984, there were no changes in Barbados' excellent human
 rights situation.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Unlawful or Arbitrary Deprivation of Life
 No killings for political motives have been reported in
 Barbados.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reports of disappearances in 1984.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Torture is specifically prohibited by the Constitution, and
 there have been no reports that it is practiced, nor have
 there been reports of cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment
 or punishment. Prison conditions are humane, although some
 overcrowding has been reported as a result of an increase in
 prison population, due principally to drug related crimes.
 Prison facilities are being expanded.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The Constitution prohibits arbitrary arrest and imprisonment,
 and this prohibition is respected in practice. The right of
 habeas corpus is guaranteed and observed; an individual must
 be taken before a court of law within 72 hours of arrest.
 Attorneys have ready access to their clients.
 e. Denial of Pair Public Trial
 The Constitution provides that anyone charged with a criminal
 offense be given a fair, public hearing within a reasonable
 time by an independent and impartial court.   This is the
 practice, and defendants are presumed innocent until proven
 guilty. The Government provides free legal aid to the
 indigent. The judiciary acts independently and is free of
 intervention from other branches of government. There are no
 political prisoners.

 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Government of Barbados does not interfere arbitrarily in
 the private lives of its citizens. The Constitution prohibits
 arbitrary search or entry, which is respected in practice.
 Warrants are required for entry and search of privately owned
 property. There is no censorship of mail or restrictions on
 the receipt of foreign publications.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution guarantees freedom of speech and press, and
 these freedoms are respected in practice. Newspapers and
 radio -tations function independently of the Government. The
 Caribbean Broadcasting Corporation Radio and Television
 Service, modeled after the British Broadcasting Corporation,
 is government-owned but is independent of government control.
 Opposition views are regularly reported.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The constitutional guarantees of peaceful assembly and private
 organization are observed. Various trade associations and
 private organizations function without government hindrance.
 Fifty percent of the labor force is organized. Protests or
 strikes have occurred when collective bargaining has failed.
 Although one major union has some ties to the opposition
 party, labor leaders and the rank-and-file are motivated
 primarily by economic and social, not political,
 considerations.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 There is full freedom of religion. While the Anglican and the
 Methodist faiths are predominate, there is a wide variety of
 religious organizations active in the country.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Citizens and legal residents move freely within and outside
 Barbados; the Constitution guarantees the right to do so. In
 replying to public criticism of some cricket players touring
 South Africa, the Government stated that it had no power to
 restrict such travel. Barbados has a small number of
 applicants for refuge and asylum admission who are handled on
 a case-by-case basis. Barbados is a party to the 1972
 Convention on the Status of Stateless Persons.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Barbados is a parliamentary democracy, following the British
 model, in which parties compete freely in honest elections
 held at least once every five years. There are no impediments
 to participation in the political process. There is universal
 suffrage, the minimum voting age being 18 years.
 The present government under the Barbados Labor Party came
 into office in 1976 and was reelected in June 1981 with 17 of
 the 27 assembly seats. The differences between the government
 party and the opposition Democratic Labor Party are based more

 BARBADOS
 on history and personalities than on ideology. Both parties
 tend toward democratic socialist policies, and they have
 assumed office in turn during three decades of self-rule. The
 'loyal opposition' criticizes the Government in generally
 constructive fashion and presumably would not hesitate to call
 attention to human rights abuses. There are no third parties
 at present, although there exists a miniscule but vocal
 leftist fringe group.
 A by-election on July 19, 1984, necessitated by the
 resignation for health reasons of a member of the ruling
 party, resulted in a one vote victory for the opposition
 party. The Barbados Labor Party appealed the results of the
 ejection to the courts, which voided the election on the basis
 of irregularities by election officials with respect to
 several ballots, which, if counted, would have changed the
 results.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 There have been no reports of human rights violations in
 Barbados and human rights groups have not requested
 investigations. Barbados advocates strengthening the human
 rights machinery of the United Nations and the Organization of
 American States. The Government favors more investigations
 into alleged violations of human rights in other countries and
 the increased use of fact-finding or observer teams to monitor
 controversial political and electoral situations. The
 Government has spoken out on human rights violations in other
 countries, particularly in the Western Hemisphere and Africa.
 There are several small groups fostering consciousness of
 human rights.
 Barbados is not covered in the Amnesty International Report
 for 1984. Freedom House gives Barbados a rating of 'free' in
 both political rights and civil liberties.
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 Barbados has a population of 252,000 with growth rate of only
 .3 percent due to continued emigration and a declining birth
 rate. The economy of Barbados, which until 1980 had enjoyed
 several years of solid growth, continues to show signs of
 weakness. The economic recovery that might have been expected
 to ensue from the upturn in the United States economy has not
 materialized.
 Citizens have long had access to public and private
 educational systems, and the adult literacy rate is 99
 percent. Primary school enrollment is compulsory. Looking
 ahead to future educational needs, the Government has begun
 expanding the secondary school system.
 Adequate medical care is available to all residents through
 local clinics and hospitals under the Government's health
 program. There is one doctor for every 1,500 people. Average
 life expectancy for Barbadians is 71.95 years. Infant
 mortality is 20 per thousand live births. Government health
 insurance programs cover all Barbadians. Overall, Barbadians
 are well-fed.

 BARBADOS
 There is no discrimination based on race or sex. Barbados is
 a signatory to the 1979 Convention on the Elimination of All
 Forms of Discrimination against Women. Women actively
 participate in all aspects of national life. One Cabinet
 member is a woman, and women are well represented at all
 levels in both the public and private sectors. Women's groups
 speak out on public issues and insist on being consulted by
 the Government on important issues.
