 URUGUAY
 Uruguay is a constitutional republic governed by an elected
 president and a bicameral legislature with an independent
 judicial branch. Its longstanding democratic tradition was
 interrupted by 12 years of military rule from 1973 to 1985. On
 March 1, 1990, following a free and fair election in November
 1989, power was transferred from one elected civilian president
 to another for the first time since the return to
 constitutional government in 1985. Political parties, the
 press, labor unions, private interest groups, and other
 nongovernmental groups function freely, and political debate is
 vigorous and unrestricted.
 Uruguay's small military establishment consists of an army, air
 force, and navy. It is under the supervision of the Ministry
 of Defense. The military does not participate in domestic
 security matters unless ordered to do so by the civilian
 authorities. Domestic security and public safety matters are
 under the jurisdiction of the Interior Ministry, which
 administers all the country's police departments.
 Uruguay is a middle income country with a per capita gross
 domestic product of $2,751 in 1990. Its economy is heavily
 dependent on agricultural exports and agroindustry. The
 economy is a mixture of private enterprise and state entities.
 Private property rights are respected. Following a short
 period of rapid growth in the mid-1980s, the economy, which
 subseguently experienced negligible growth for several years,
 revived slightly and grew an estimated 2.5 percent in gross
 national product in 1991. In an attempt to reverse long-term
 economic stagnation, the Administration of President Luis.
 Alberto Lacalle is trying to implement sweeping reforms
 designed to increase investment, reduce the fiscal deficit,
 contain inflation, and privatize certain government-owned
 companies.
 Uruguayans continue to enjoy a broad range of individual rights
 and liberties. Violence against women attracted increasing
 public attention, while latent discrimination against the black
 minority remained a largely unrecognized and unaddressed
 problem.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 No cases of politically motivated killing were reported, but
 there was one instance of alleged extrajudicial killing
 (see Section 1.c.).
 b. Disappearance
 No known or reported incidents of politically motivated
 abductions or disappearances occurred in 1991.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 The Constitution prohibits brutal treatment of prisoners.
 However, there were recurrent but unsubstantiated reports of
 physical abuse of detainees by police officers. In July a
 detainee who had implicated three police officers as
 
 
 756
 URUGUAY
 accomplices in a series of robberies was found hanged in the
 bathroom of the jail where the accused officers worked. An
 administrative error had led to.his return to jail after he had
 testified against the officers; the judge investigating the
 case had ordered that the detainee be transferred to another
 jail. Following an internal affairs investigation and autopsy,
 details of which were publicized, Uruguayan authorities
 concluded that the death was a suicide. The dead man's family
 and friends claimed that he was murdered. It remained unclear
 whether they would pursue legal action. As a result of alleged
 physical torture and mistreatment in connection with an arrest
 occurring on November 1, police arrested and charged two agents
 of the narcotics brigade, who remained under administrative and
 judicial investigation at year's end. Authorities also
 suspended the agents' immediate supervisor and ordered the
 temporary removal of the chief of the narcotics brigade.
 Generally poor conditions in the Uruguayan prison system have
 given rise to charges of prisoner neglect and mistreatment.
 Prisoners suffer from inadequate professional supervision,
 insufficient exercise and rehabilitation training, and lack of
 medical attention. Although conditions in the maximum security
 prison of Libertad improved after the appointment of a new
 warden in December 1990, there were 2 suicides and at least 20
 attempted suicides during the first 8 months of 1991 in the
 juvenile detention system . In addition, deficiencies in the
 state psychiatric hospital system have led to claims of patient
 neglect. Uruguayan authorities recognize the problems in the
 penal system and have made efforts to correct them, but
 available resources have been insufficient to provide
 significant improvement.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The Constitution requires the police to have a written warrant
 issued by a judge before they can make an arrest. The only
 exception is when the accused is apprehended during the
 commission of a crime. The Constitution also guarantees an
 accused the right to a judicial determination of the legality
 of detention and requires that the detaining authority explain
 and justify to the judiciary the legal grounds for the
 detention. A detainee may be held incommunicado by the police
 for a period of 24 hours before being presented to a judge, at
 which time he or she has a right to counsel. If the detainee
 cannot afford a lawyer, a public defender is appointed. The
 judge must begin the judicial process within 48 hours of an
 arrest. Failure to comply with this 48-hour rule has led to
 the release of accused persons. If the crime carries a penalty
 of at least 2 years in prison, the accused person is confined
 during the judge's investigation unless the authorities agree
 to release him or her on bail, or until the case is closed.
 These constitutional provisions are generally respected in
 practice.
 e. .Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The Constitution provides for an independent judiciary, headed
 by a Supreme Court, which in turn supervises the work of the
 lower courts. There is a parallel military court system under
 the Military Justice Code, and the law provides for two
 military justices on the Supreme Court who participate only in
 cases involving the military. Military justice is applicable
 to civilians only during a state of war or insurrection. The
 independence of the judiciary is well respected in practice.
 
 
 757
 URUGUAY
 All trials must open with a public statement of the charge by
 the prosecutor or the complainant. Trial proceedings are based
 on written arguments, which are not normally made public, and
 the defense attorney has access to all documents that form part
 of the written record. Beginning in 1990 the Uruguayan legal
 system began to introduce oral arguments into court
 proceedings. Under Uruguayan law, there is no provision
 against self-incrimination, and the defendant may be compelled
 to answer any questions posed by the judge. All sentences may
 be appealed by the defense attorney or prosecutor to a higher
 court which may acquit the person of the crime, let the
 sentence stand, or reduce or increase the sentence.
 Uruguay has no political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Constitution protects the right to privacy. It states that
 the home, absolutely inviolable at night, may be entered and
 searched only with a legal warrant during the day. Protection
 for private papers and correspondence is equally strong, and a
 warrant is required for confiscation. These rights and
 safeguards are generally respected in practice.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 . a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution provides for freedom of speech and press. All
 elements of the political spectrum freely express their
 viewpoints in both the print and broadcast media. Montevideo
 has 5 daily newspapers and 10 important weeklies; there are
 approximately 115 weekly newspapers in the interior of the
 country. Montevideo has 3 commercial television stations and
 about 30 radio stations, while Uruguay as a whole has
 approximately 110 radio stations and 20 television stations.
 The National University is autonomous, and academic freedom is
 generally respected.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Freedom of assembly and association are protected by law.
 Formerly banned groups, such as the Tupamaros, freely organize
 and express their opinions. Public marches and demonstrations
 are allowed with permits from the Ministry of the Interior and
 occur without official harassment or intimidation.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Freedom of religion, provided for by the Constitution, is
 respected in practice. Most Uruguayans who practice a religion
 are Roman Catholic. Members of other religious groups exercise
 their faiths unhindered, and missionaries are free to
 proselytize. Uruguayans who profess agnosticism or atheism
 express their views freely.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Internal and foreign travel.and emigration are unrestricted.
 Uruguayans who left the country during the military regime and
 wish to return are encouraged to do so. All of the prominent
 political figures exiled by the military regime have returned.

 URUGUAY
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Uruguayan citizens have the right and ability peacefully to
 change their government. Uruguay is a multiparty democracy
 with mandatory universal suffrage for those 18 years of age or
 older. Voting is not restricted by race, sex, religion, or
 economic status. The Colorado Party, the National (Blanco)
 Party, a coalition known as the Broad Front, and the New Space
 Coalition are the four major political groupings. Each allows
 ideological divisions within the party, and each such division
 may field its own slate of candidates in general elections.
 The electoral system combines a primary and a general election
 in a double simultaneous vote. Each party fields different
 lists of candidates; in essence, voters express a preference
 for a list rather than an individual candidate as well as vote
 for a party.
 The winning list of the party that gets the most votes wins the
 Presidency and a proportion of seats in the Senate and Chamber
 of Deputies corresponding to the percentage of votes that the
 party as a whole received. A party therefore may run multiple
 presidential candidates, each with his or her own slate of
 legislative candidates. National and provincial elections are
 held simultaneously every 5 years.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Local human rights groups, some of which could not operate
 openly under military rule, now function freely and without
 restriction. A prominent local human rights group, Peace and
 Justice Service (SERPAJ), was legalized in early 1985 after
 operating underground for 2 years during the military regime.
 SERPAJ investigates cases involving killing, torture, and
 disappearances which occurred during the military regime and
 has also become involved in investigating current prison
 conditions in Uruguay.
 The Government is open to inquiries from such organizations and
 does not restrict the activities of human rights
 investigators. The Government has also fully complied with
 U.N. Human Rights Commission inquiries dating from the military
 regime period and is a strong supporter of, and participant in,
 human rights activities in international forums such as the
 United Nations and Organization of American States.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Discrimination based on race, sex, religion, language, or
 social status is prohibited by the Constitution and by law, and
 there is no evidence of officially sanctioned discrimination.
 Approximately 4 percent of Uruguay's population, or 120,000 to
 130,000 people, belong to the country's black minority. Blacks
 are underrepresented among elite groups and are almost
 completely absent from the professional, bureaucratic,
 political, and academic sectors of society. They lack the
 educational opportunities and social and political connections
 necessary for entry into these groups. The Government has not
 addressed this issue because most Uruguayans do not believe
 that racial discrimination is a problem in Uruguay.
 
 
 759
 URUGUAY
 Uruguayan women enjoy equality under the law but face a number
 of forms of discrimination stemming from traditional attitudes
 and practices. For example, in the labor force, service
 sectors tend to be sexually segregated with only women working
 as supermarket cashiers and only men employed as waiters or
 taxi drivers. Women make up approximately one-third of the
 work force. Some pursue professional careers. Women attend
 the National University in large numbers. However, they are
 underrepresented in traditionally male professions such as
 engineering or architecture. Women are found at the highest
 levels of the Uruguayan private or public sectors, but their
 numbers are relatively limited. Conscious of this, the Lacalle
 Administration initiated discussions with legislative
 authorities on establishing a "National Institute for Women"
 which could more effectively address these issues.
 Uruguayan society is becoming sensitized to the question of
 violence against women. A strong women's rights movementin
 Uruguay is bringing increased attention to the problem, and a
 statistical base is being developed. The isgue of violence
 against women is closely linked in the public eye with that of
 child abuse, and the Government is expressing increasing
 cencern about both problems. A Women's Division in the police
 force, concerned exclusively with crimes directed agianst
 women, has been in existence for 3 years. In late 1991 the
 Interior Minister announced plans to merge this division with a
 counterpart activity established for cases involving minors in
 order to create a more effective division responsible for
 family matters within the police force. The penal code
 mandates a sentence of from 3 months in jail to 3 years in
 prison for the crime of "private violence." A government
 agency, the Commission of Women, receives the complaints of
 abused women, but many women are unable to make and sustain
 such a complaint, especially those who continue to reside with
 their partners.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 The Constitution guarantees the right of workers to organize
 freely and encourages the formation of trade unions. Civil
 servants may join unions, as may employees of state-run
 enterprises. All labor unions are independent of government
 and political party control.
 Uruguayan workers, including some civil servants, have the
 right to strike and many unions did so during 1991. No
 institutionalized mechanism for arbitration or mediation
 exists, but the Ministry of Labor and Social Security does
 assume the role of mediator on an ad hoc basis.
 The Government may legally compel workers to work during a
 strike if their work is considered an essential service. The
 definition of an essential service is relatively limited,
 although in some cases it may exceed International Labor
 Organization (ILO) guidelines. In 1991 the "essential
 services" provision was invoked to maintain services at
 Montevideo's airport during a January general strike. The
 essential services provision was invoked twice again during
 December strikes at the ANCAP petroleum conglomerate and at the
 Montevideo port. ANCAP workers suspended their strike
 immediately after the decrees; at the port, workers remained on
 strike for several days afterward, and replacement workers
 resumed some, but not full, port operations.

 URUGUAY
 There are no restrictions on a union's right to affiliate with
 international trade union bodies. The largest trade union
 confederation, the Inter-Union Workers Assembly-National
 Workers Association (PIT-CNT), is by choice not officially
 affiliated with any of the three world federations. Many
 individual unions are affiliated with international trade
 secretariats.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 Collective bargaining ceased during military rule. Since the
 return of civilian government, industrial contracts have been
 negotiated on a sector-wide rather than plant-by-plant basis.
 These negotiations take place under the auspices of a salary
 coundil, a tripartite organization composed of representatives
 from government, labor, and management. Each industrial sector
 has its own council. The role played by the Government can
 vary from council to council. In some councils, the government
 representatives see themselves primarily as arbitrators or
 mediators and participate in the negotiations only when there
 is an impasse. In others, the government representative is an
 active, equal participant in all phases of the negotiations.
 The Government must approve labor contracts before they become
 legally binding'on the parties. Most employers like the
 security gained from the council system; most unions like the
 equity of wages that result from sector-wide negotiations.
 Although the Labor Ministry had stated publicly that the
 Government would leave contract negotiations strictly to labor
 and management beginning in January 1991, the Government
 continued to participate in these discussions during the year.
 While no institutionalized mechanism exists in Uruguay for
 resolving complaints against employers, discrimination by
 employers, including arbitrary dismissal for union activity,
 generally is prohibited. If a proposed labor reform law now
 under consideration is approved by Parliament, workers could
 legally be dismissed for participating in an illegal strike.
 Workers employed in the two special export zones are fully
 covered by all labor legislation. There are no unions in
 either zone, but there are as yet relatively few workers in
 traditionally organizable occupations.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Forced or compulsory labor is prohibited by law, and there is
 no evidence that would indicate its existence in practice.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 Children are protected by a child labor code. Violations of
 the Code are punishable by fines of up to $500. Children under
 the age of 15 generally are not employed, but children as young
 as 12 may be employed if they have a special government work
 permit.* Children under the age of 18 may not perform
 dangerous, fatiguing, or night work, apart from domestic
 employment. Salaries and hours for children are-controlled
 more strictly than for adults. Children over the age of 16 may
 sue in court for payment of wages, and children have the legal
 right to dispose of their own income. Children working in the
 expanding informal sector as street vendors or others with no
 fixed place of work, or in the agrarian sector, are generally
 less strictly regulated and receive lower pay.
 
 
 761
 URUGUAY
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 A legislated minimum wage is in effect in both the public and
 private sectors. The minimum wage appears to be effectively
 enforced and adhered to. Currently, the minimum wage for the
 public sector is adjusted every 4 months, while private sector
 wages are adjusted on the basis of an inflation "trigger." The
 Government is now considering abolishing the linking of wage
 increases to the past rate of inflation and instead basing
 calculations on an expected declining inflationary trend. A
 family dependent on one minimum wage would be living below the
 "poverty line" and would be in the poorest 20 percent of the
 population.
 The standard workweek is 48 hours for a 6-day week. Industrial
 workers receive overtime compensation for work in excess of 48
 hours. Workers are entitled to 20 days of paid vacation after
 a year of employment. Workers are protected by legislation
 regulating the health and safety of working conditions; it is
 enforced by the Ministry of Labor and Social Security in a
 generally effective manner. Some labor regulations cover
 urban, industrial workers more adequately than rural and
 agricultural workers.
