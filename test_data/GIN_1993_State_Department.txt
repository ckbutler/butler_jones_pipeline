 GUINEA
 President Lansana Conte and an appointed Transitional Committee for National
 Recovery (CTRN)-two-thirds civilian, one-third military--continued to direct the
 pace of political reform. Guinea held its first multiparty presidential elections in
 more than three decades on December 19 and planned to hold legislative elections
 in 1994. In a highly controversial election, Conte was elected President gaining 51.7
 percent of the vote in the final official count. Although all 42 political parties par-
 ticipated in the election, the Government controlled the electoral process from start
 to finish, and the opposition was denied any significant role. The Government in-
 sisted on holding the elections, notwithstanding considerable pressure for postpone-
 ment from outside observers, religious leaders, and the Electoral Commission itself.
 The results of the election were contested by opposition party observers, who were
 excluded from the final hours of the vote-counting. The Supreme Court, in reviewing
 the opposition's claim that the election results had been achieved by fraudulent
 means, upheld the first round victory of Lansana Conte.
 Military and paramilitary forces number around 17,000. Responsibility for inter-
 nal security is shared by a Gendarmerie, the Republican Guard, the National Police,
 and the Presidential Guard. Both military personnel and police committed human
 rights abuses.
 Over 80 percent of the population of 7 million people is engaged in subsistence
 agriculture, and per capita gross domestic product is abeut $430. Guinea's major ex-
 ports are bauxite, gold, and diamonds. The World Bank and the International Mone-
 tary Fund continued to contribute to Guinea's economic restructuring program,
 which involved, among other things, a sharp reduction in the size of the public serv-
 ice. This austerity program created a pool of unemployed civil servants who contin-
 ued to be a source of civil unrest.
 Human rights remained circumscribed despite holding presidential elections in-
 volving 8 candidates and 42 political parties. The Government carefully directed the
 electoral process and rejected opposition demands for important changes. However,
 all candidates had access to the media and were able to organize political rallies.
 Against a background of sporadic outbreaks of ethnically based violence and re-
 course to vigilante justice by a citizenry beset by increasingly violent criminal activ-
 ity, major human rights abuses included torture and extrajudicial killings by poorly
 disciplined security forces; government failure to guarantee access by attorneys to
 clients in prison where much abuse takes place with impunity; the executive
 branch's influence over the judicial system; the Government's continued neglect of
 the prison system and poor treatment of prisoners; and its inability to prevent vigi-
 lante justice.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extra udicial Killing.-There were no reports of political
 killings, but there were a number of extrajudicial killings. Security forces used ex-
 cessive force in responding to peaceful demonstrations, notably on May 25, when 31
 political parties staged a largely peaceful, unauthorized march of more than 100,000
 
 
 119
 people in Conakry. Official reports indicated that 2 people were killed and more
 than 200 injured in this confrontation. Opposition leaders stated that it was only
 after the march officially ended that local authorities instigated violence by deploy-
 ing local toughs, some of whom looted and destroyed stores owned by members of
 the same ethnic group that played an active role in organizing the rally. No one was
 arrested, charged, or disciplined in connection with either the killings or injuries.
 Police again used excessive force on September 28 in dispersing a crowd at a dem-
 onstration organized by various political parties demanding a transitional govern-
 ment of national unity and an independent electoral commission. Officials admitted
 that security forces killed two persons and and wounded nine during the violence.
 The official casualty report for the violence and ensuing ethnic conflict was 63 dead,
 hundreds wounded, and scores arrested. The opposition claimed that mayors of the
 local municipalities had paid progovernment Party for Unity and Progress (PUP)
 members to disrupt the September 28 demonstration as a pretext for intervention
 by security forces.
 On February 8 in Faranah, the military authorities sent soldiers to control a dem-
 onstration by disgruntled youths who had paid to be recruited into the army and
 then were rejected by army recruiters, allegedly for their opposition sympathies.
 One soldier fired directly into the crowd, killing 3 women and injuring 20 other
 demonstrators when the youths began destroying the property of local officials. Mili-
 tary authorities investigated and transferred the soldier to another part of the coun-
 try.
 On June 4, security forces fired into a crowd of protesters in Dinguiraye, killing
 Ousmane Ba and another man and ij*uring 15 others. Although an investigation
 was opened by the local prosecutor, no charges were filed or arrests made.
 In Augst Conakry police tortured several detainees and beat one person to death
 in a case in which the son of a prominent businessman had been murdered. The
 golice reportedly tried to cover up the incident by forcing a doctor to issue a false
 eath certificate listing heart failure as the cause of death. The authorities sus-
 pended and detained the police official in charge of the station where the torture
 reportedly occurred. Authorities arrested two officers. They remain under detention,
 pending a review of the case by a court of first instance.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of disappearances. There was no
 progress in resolving the disappearance of 63 people arrested in the wake of the
 April 1984 seizure of power and the July 1985 coup attempt, despite a suit filed in
 1992 by the Association of Victims of Repression (AVR) against present and former
 government officials involved in the arrests.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The 1965 Penal Code and the 1990 Constitution prohibit torture and cruel inhu-
 man, and degrading treatment. However, the police are often responsible for brutal-
 ity against suspects and, in at least one case, beat to death a detainee (see Section
 1.a.). The use of beatings to extract confessions is common.
 Prison conditions, including those in the women's prison, are primitive and
 unhealthy.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Penal Code requires that detainees
 must be charged within 72 hours before a magistrate. Once charged, the accused
 may be held until the final outcome of the case, including during the period of any
 appeals. Release on bail is at the discretion of the magistrate who has jurisdiction
 in the case. The Constitution proscribes incommunicado detention. The law guaran-
 tees attorneys access to their clients, but this provision is often not respected.
 In practice, administrative controls over the police are ineffective, and security
 forces rarely follow the Penal Code; arbitrary arrest remained a persistent threat
 to Guineans. During the election campaign security forces detained and tortured a
 bodyguard of one of the opposition candidates. The authorities never brought
 charges against those involved, even after public disclosure of the incident.
 In April security forces arrested two members of the Air Force, Lieutenant Madice
 Keita and Lieutenant Souleymane Dayan Diallo, and held them for 15 days, osten-
 sibly for involvement in a coup plot. During the election campaign, the military held
 several junior officers incommunicado for questioning; they were released within a
 week.
 At years end, there were no known political or security detainees being held by
 the Government. The authorities freed Amadou Diallo, who was arrested in 1992
 for allegedly plottingto kill the President.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution affirms the judiciary's independ-
 ence. However, magistrates are civil servants with no guarantee of tenure and are
 susceptible to influence by the executive branch. Judicial authorities often defer to
 central authorities in politically sensitive cases. In addition, the administration of
 justice is plagued by numerous other problems, including a shortage of magistrates
 
 
 (who generally are poorly trained) and lawyers (there are 45 in all), and an outdated
 and overly restrictive Penal Code. There are also allegations of corruption and nepo-
 tism in the judiciary, with relatives of influential members of the Government being
 virtually above the law.
 The Penal Code provides for the presumption of innocence of accused persons, the
 independence of judges, the equality of citizens before the law, the right of the ac-
 cused to counsel, and the right to appeal a judicial decision. Although the Govern-
 ment in principle provides funds for egal defense in serious criminal cases, in prac-
 tice these funds are rarely disbursed; the lawyer frequently either receives no pay-
 ment or provides no services to defend the accused.
 The judiciary includes courts of first instance, two Courts of Appeal (one in
 Kankan and one in Conakry), and the Supreme Court, the court of final appeal,
 which heard its first case in April. There is also a State Security Court, but it has
 not met since the trial of those allegedly involved in the coup attempt of 1985. A
 military tribunal prepares and adjudicates charges against accused military person-
 nel. Since 1988 all judgments regarding violations under the Penal Code have been
 rendered by civilian courts. There is a traditional system of justice at the village
 or urban neighborhood level at which litigants present their civil cases before a vil-
 lage chief, neighborhood chief, or council of wise men. If a case cannot be resolved
 to the satisfaction of all parties in the traditional system, it may be referred to the
 formal system for adjudication.
 Guinea did not have any known political prisoners at the end of 1993.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution provides for inviolability of the home. In public statements, the Gov-
 ernment also stressed the inviolability of the home, and judicial search warrants are
 required by law. However, these procedures are frequently ignored or not strictly
 followed, and interference in citizens' lives continued, primarily through police har-
 assment. Police and paramilitary police often ignore legal procedures in the pursuit
 of criminals and frequently detain private civilians at night roadblocks in order to
 extort money to supplement their low salaries. It is widely believed that security
 officials monitor mai[ and telephone calls.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Government has stated publicly that it sup-
 ports free speech and a free press, and the new Constitution provides freedom of
 expression, subject to certain limitations. The Government introduced in 1992 a new
 Press Law and a National Communications Council (NCC), ostensibly to assure im-
 partiality in the media. While proclaiming freedom of the press and communica-
 tions, the Press Law gives the Government a sufficiently broad range of-possible re-
 strictive actions as to vitiate any real protection. It prohibits seditious talk or chants
 uttered in public, establishes defamation and slander as criminal offenses, and pro-
 hibits communications that offend the President, incite violence, discrimination, or
 hatred, or disturb the public peace.
 The Government owns and operates the electronic news media, with national and
 rural radio being the most important outlet in reaching the public. It also publishes
 the official newspaper, Horoya. Reporters for the official press, who are government
 employees, practice self-censorship in order to protect their jobs. The Ministry of
 Communication continues to act as overseer of state-owned media.
 In May the NCC granted free air time-only 5 minutes on television and 10 min-
 utes on radio per month-to all political parties. During the fall presidential election
 campaign, candidates expressed their views freely and had alloted access nightly to
 the television and radio network. Of the total of 240 broadcasts prepared by the can-
 didates, the Communications Commission rejected one broadcast because it used an
 unofficial language (the candidate did not protest) and rejected another due to al-
 leged slanderous content (this candidate's banned remarks were soon printed and
 distributed throughout Conakry.)
 A vocal and active opposition press has grown since 1992 and is widely read by
 politically active Guineans, mainly in the capital. Its reporters do not practice self-
 censorship, and its articles harshly criticized the President and the Government. At
 least one new independent journal, L'Horizon, was launched. The approximately 25
 existing publications, many launched in 1992, continued to publish despite continu-
 ing technical and financial difficulties. Some newspapers are linked with opposition
 parties while others offer news and criticism of both the Government and the oppo-
 sition.
 Many political tracts, both signed and unsigned, circulated widely throughout
 Conakriy and other regions, and included specific criticisms of the President and
 high officials. Foreign publications, some of which include criticism of the Govern-
 ment, circulated freely.
 
 
 121
 There were no known attempts to interfere with foreign radio broadcasts. How-
 ever, the Government showed its sensitivity to its image abroad by harassing sev-
 eral journalists involved in international reporting. The radio authorities on March
 15 officially suspended Ben Daouda Sylla, a journalist at the state-owned national
 radio station and correspondent for Africa Number One, ostensibly for his portrayal
 of a "truncated image of Guinea," but presumably for his more critical accounts
 transmitted outside the country. He was allowed to resume his duties for Africa
 Number One in May. The police interrogated Serge Daniel, a journalist from Benin
 working as the Radio France correspondent, ostensibly because his visa papers were
 not in order, but allegedly due to his reporting on the political situation.
 The Ministry of Higher Education exercises limited control over academic freedom
 through its influence on the faculty hiring process. In general, teachers are not sub-
 ject to classroom censorship.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-Freedom of association is pro-
 tected by law, but there are legal restrictions on assembly. The Penal Code bans
 any meeting that has an ethnic or racial character or any gathering "whose nature
 threatens national unity." A September 1992 statute allows public gatherings only
 with prior notification to the Government.
 Pursuant to this statute, local administrative authorities may cancel a demonstra-
 tion or meeting if they have grounds to believe that public order will be threatened.
 Event orga;.izers may be held criminally liable if there is violence or destruction of
 property. Local officials declared opposition parties liable for the destruction of prp-
 erty after the May 25 march (see Section l.a.), but the Government did not press
 charges, and the case was eventually dropped. In late September, the Government
 reported that 63 people died in interethnic violence following political marches in
 Conakry. The Government did not charge the march organizers with responsibility
 for the violence. The Government suspended the right to march in the streets in re-
 sponse to this outbreak of violence. During the election campaign, the Government
 permitted political parties to hold mass demonstrations throughout the country.
 Political parties must provide information on their founding members and produce
 internal statutes and politica  atorms which are consistent with the Constitution
 before the Government will recognize them. The 43 parties that applied for official
 recognition received it.
 c.Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution declares Guinea to be a secular State,
 and religious groups enjoy religious freedom. An estimated 85 pe~cent of the popu-
 lation is Muslim. The Govenment observes major Christian and Muslim holidays.
 Foreign missionaries, both Catholic and Protestant, operate freely.
 The Government and the quasi-governmental National Islamic league have spo-
 ken out against the proliferation of "pseudo-sects generating confusion and devi-
 ation' (within Guinean Islam) but have not restricted these groups. The Constitu-
 tion provides religious communities the freedom to administer themselves without
 state interference.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-Guineans are generally free to travel within the country and to change
 their place of residence and work, Travelers face periodic harassment by police and
 military roadblocks, particularly at night. Citizens commonly pay bribes to avoid po-
 lice harassment. Foreign travel is not restricted; many Guineans travel widely.
 The Government restricted movement on election day. Also, at the height of the
 election campaign, the Minister of Defense issued an order, without specified time
 limit, closing Guinea's land borders. The Government had not rescinded this order
 at year's end, although cross-border movement of people and goods soon resu med.
 There were two incidents of travel restrictions or political reasons. On election
 day, paramilitary police at a checktpoe outside Conakry did not allow opposition
 presidential candidhate ean Marie  oe tass, thereby preventing him from vot-
 ing. A few days later at the same checkpoint, security forces denied passdge to oppo-
 sition presidential candidate Mamadou Ba. The order was reversed within 8 hours.
 Guinea currently hosts approximately 580,000 Liberian and Sierra eionean refu-
 liees. An additional 80,000 Guinean residents of Liberia and Sierra Leone fled vio-
 ence and returned to Guinea, where they received relief assistance. The Govern-
 ment continued to work closely with the United Nations High Commissioner for Ref-
 ugees and many other international and nongovernmental organizations to provide
 food and shelter to those designated as refugees.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Throughout 1993 President Conte, his Cabinet, and the presidentially a p pointed
 legislature (CTRN) wielded full powers of government. On  seember 19, hureans
 had their first opportunity in over 30 years to change their government by demo-
 
 
 cratic means. However, the Government controlled the electoral process, and
 Lansana Conte was elected President in a disputed outcome. A former military offi-
 cer, Conte first came to power in 1984 in a bloodless military coup d'etat.
 Following the vote, opposition candidates claimed serious electoral irregularities
 and, in particular, protested the unilateral annulment by the Minister of Interior
 and Security of results from Siguiri prefecture, which voted heavily for an opposition
 candidate. They also pointed out that the provisional results announced by the Min-
 ister of Interior and Security on December 23, which gave President Conte a major-
 ity of 50.93 percent, were inconsistent with the preliminary results that they and
 independent observers had noted at the National Vote Counting Commission. Subse-
 quently, the opposition petitioned the Supreme Court to nullify the results that had
 given President Conte a first-round victory. On January 4, 1994, the Court annulled
 e results of Siguiri prefecture and the city. of Kankan and declared candidate
 Lansana Conte the winner with 51.7 percent of the vote.
 The Government postponed the first elections for the National Assembly, sched-
 uled for 1992, until 1994 pending, among other things, the completion of a national
 census upon which voter rolls could be based. The Government completed that cen-
 sus in November. The opposition alleged that the Government manipulated the
 voter census in Conte's favor, but international observers stated the census was ac-
 ceptable.
 he presidential party, the Party for Unity and Progress (PUP), held a pre-
 eminent position going into the December election. Throughout the year, the opposi-
 tion made credible claims that the Government provided the PUP with state re-
 sources to support its campaigns, refused to modify preelection procedures, and
 pressured civil servants to support, or not to oppose openly, the PUP. The Govern-
 ment rejected opposition political groups' demands for the establishment of a transi-
 tional government of national unity prior to the election. Although the Government
 established a National Electoral Commission as demanded by the opposition, it was
 an advisory panel without authority to direct the elections.
 PUP's strength also rested on the fragmentation of the opposition. The three lead-
 ing opposition parties are the Malinke-basd Assembly of the Guinean People, the
 Peuhl (Fulani)-basd Union for the New Republic, and the Party of Renewal and
 Proreas.
 While women are poorly represented in the Government, they voted overwhelm-
 ingly in the presidential election on December 19. All voters, male and female, were
 able to vote in secret and were treated equally.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Local nongovernmental organizations primarily interested in human rights issues
 included: the Guinean Organization for Human Rights (OGDH); the Guinean Asso-
 ciation for the Defense of Human Rights; the Children of the Victims of Camp Boiro;
 the Associati     tims of Repression (AVR); and the Committee for the  efense
 of Civic Rights formed in 1993. These groups, especially OGDH and AVR, were vocal
 in calling attention to human rights auses ut had to be cautious in criticizing the
 Government. Following an appeal by the president of the International Federation
 for Human Rights, inMarh the Interior Minister withdrew his August 1992 sus-
 pension of OGDH and AVR for taking part in a political march in July 1992.
 The Government does not welcome commentary or investigation by outside groups
 of its human rights practices, which it sees as strictly an internal matter.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution states that all persons are equal before the law regardless of
 gender, race, ethnicity, language, beliefs, political opinions, philosophy, or creed.
 Women.-Although the Constitution provides for equal treatment of men and
 women, women face discrimination, particularly in rural areas, where opportunities
 for women are limited by custom andthe demands of child-rearing and arduous sub-
 sistence farming. The Government has affirmed the principle of equal pay for equal
 work, but in practice women receive less pay than men in most jobs. In education,
 according to a United Nations Development Program report for 1991, females re-
 ceive only 20 percent as much schooling as males.
 Violence against women, including wife beating, is common, although social work-
 ers differ as to the extent of the problem. Wife beating is a criminal offense and
 constitutes grounds for divorce und er cii l aw h or, police rarely intervene in
 domestic disputes. The issue received some exposure in locally produced television
 dramas but is rarely mentioned in the press or given governmental attention.
 
 
 123
 Children.-The Constitution provides that the Government has a particular obli-
 gation to protect and nurture the nation's youth. The Government devotes a signifi-
 cant percentage of its annual budget to primary education.
 Female genital mutilation (circumcision), which has been condemned by inter-
 national health experts as damaging to both physical and mental health, is per-
 formed at an early age and is practiced among Muslims and animists in Guinea.
 According to an independent expert, about 60 percent of Guinean females have un-
 dergone this procedure. Grandmothers frequently insist on the circumcision of a
 granddaughter, even when the parents are oppsd. The most dangerous form of cir-
 cumcision, infibulation, is not practiced. The Government has recently made efforts
 to educate health workers on the dangers of this procedure, and at the World
 Health Organization Assembly in May cosponsored a resolution calling for a plan
 of action for eliminating the harmful traditional practice worldwide.
 National Raciol/Ethnic Minorities-While racial or ethnic discrimination is pro-
 hibited by the Constitution and the Penal Code ethnic identification is strong, and
 mutual suspicion affects relations across ethnic lines, in and out of government. The
 Cabinet includes representatives of all major ethnic groups. A disproportionate
 number of senior military officers are Soussou, the ethnic group of President Conte.
 In March there were incidents of interethnic violence between Soussou and Peuhl,
 including in Forecariah, where houses were looted and destroyed in the wake of a
 political rally, and in Conakry, where a minor incident escalated into fighting that
 resulted in two deaths. In late September, interethnic violence between Peuhl and
 Soussou in Conakry led to 63 deaths. During the election season, Malinke support-
 ers of presidential candidate Alpha Coride clashed with mainly Soussou supporters
 of President Conte in different areas of Upper Guinea. Presidential voting often di-
 vided along ethnic lines.
 People with Disabilities. -The Constitution declares that all persons are equal be-
 fore the law. There are no special constitutional provisions for the disabled. The
 Government has not mandated accessibility for the disabled.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution provides for the right of employees
 to form labor unions and protects them from discrimination based on their union
 affiliation. Only an estimated 5 percent of the workforce is unionized. Most union
 members are government employees or employees of the national utilities (electric,
 water, and telephone companies.)
 Guinea's Labor Code, drafted with the assistance of the International Labor Orga-
 nization (ILO) and promulgated in January 1988, states that all workers (except
 military and paramilitary) have the right to create and participate in organizations
 that defend and develop their individual and collective rights as workers. The Labor
 Code requires elected worker representatives for any enterprise employing 25 or
 more salaried workers.
 While the new Labor Code ended the previously existing trade union monopoly
 system, most union workers still belong to the former sole confederation, the Na-
 tional Confederation of Guinean Workers (CNTG). The CNTG is indirectly funded
 by the State, although officials seek to increase the Confederation's freedom from
 government control. Independent unions and confederations are rapidly gaining pop-
 ularity, such as the National Organization for Free Trade Unions of Guinea and the
 Free Union of Teachers and Researchers of Guinea.
 The Labor Code grants salaried workers, including public sector civilian employ-
 ees, the right to strike 10 days after their representative union makes known its
 intention to strike. In sectors affecting "essential services" (e.g., hospitals, schools,
 media, and bakeries) some provisions for a minimal level of service may be required,
 though it is not clear how this principle is to be applied.
 In 1993 workers increasingly resorted to strikes and threats of strikes o achieve
 their demands. In April and May union leaders at the state-owned electric utility,
 Enelgui, led two successful strikes demanding salary increases. Workers in Guinea's
 six banks went on strike for 1 week in May and threatened to do so again in June,
 seeking compliance with bank regulations on salaries and other issues applicable in
 surrounding Francophone countries.
 Unions may freely associate with international labor groups. The Government
 continued to designate the CNTG to represent Guinean workers in the ILO Con-
 ference in 1993.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Under the Labor Code, rep-
 resentative workers' unions or union groups may organize the workplace and nego-
 tiate with employers or employer organizations. Collective bargaining for wages and
 salaries without government interference is protected by law. Work rules and work
 hours established by the employer are to be developedin consultation with union
 
 
 delegates. The Code also prohibits antiunion discrimination. Union delegates rep-
 resent individual and collective claims and grievances with management. Individual
 workers threatened with dismissal or other sanctions have the right to a hearing
 before management with a union representative present and, if necessary, to take
 the complaint to the Conakry Labor Court which convenes weekly to hear such
 cases. In the interior, civil courts hear labor cases.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Labor Code specifically for-
 bids forced or compulsory labor, and there is no evidence of its practice.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The minimum age for employment
 under the Labor Code is 16 years. However, apprentices may start at 14 years.
 Workers and apprentices under the age of 18 are not permitted to work at night,
 for more than 12 consecutive hours, or on Sundays. The Labor Code also states that
 the Minister of Labor and Social Affairs must maintain a list of occupations in
 which women and youth under 18 may not be employed. In practice, enforcement
 by Ministry inspectors is limited to large firms in the modern sector of the economy;
 children ofa  a es work on family farms and in small trades. No minimum years
 of schooling are required; fewer than one-third of school-age children attend school.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The Government has not yet enacted minimum
 wage legislation, but the Labor Code provides for the eventual establishment by de-
 cree of a guaranteed minimum hourly wage. There are also provisions in the Code
 for overtime and night wages which are fixed percentages of the regular wage. Ac-
 cording to the Labor Code, regular work is not to exceed 10-hour days or 48-hour
 weeks, with a 40-hour workweek being the norm, and at least 24 consecutive hours
 of rest each week, usually on Sunday. Every salaried worker has the right to an
 annual paid vacation, accumulated at the rate of at least 2.5 workdays per month
 of service. In practice, these rules are enforced only in the relatively small modern
 urban sector.
 The Labor Code contains provisions of a general nature respecting occupational
 safety and health, but the Government has not yet elaborated a set of practicable
 workplace health and safety standards. Neither has it as yet issued any of the min-
 isterial orders laying out the specific requirements for certain occupations and for
 certain methods of work that are called for in the Labor Code. The Ministry of
 Labor and Social Affairs is responsible for enforcing labor standards, and its inspec-
 tors are empowered to suspend work immediately in situations hazardous to health.
 However, enforcement remained more of a goal than a reality. Labor inspectors ac-
 knowledge that they cannot even cover Conakry, much less the entire country, with
 their small staff and meager budget.
