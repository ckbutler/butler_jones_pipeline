 AUSTRALIA
 Australia is a long established, multiparty, parliamentary
 democracy operating within a federal system of government.
 Federal elections were held in July 1987, and will be held
 again before November 21, 1990.
 Federal, state, and local police in Australia act in
 conformity with civil law, which respects and safeguards
 individual human rights. Civil law is observed in practice.
 Australia's developed economy, with important mining and
 agricultural sectors, provides most Australians with a high
 per capita income. Furthermore, the Government provides
 assistance for the minority of relatively disadvantaged
 citizens. Individuals are free to hold private property, to
 pursue their economic and personal interests, to associate
 with others, and to organize trade unions.
 Australia has been in the forefront of those countries
 promoting human rights both domestically and internationally.
 Fundamental human rights are assured by law and respected in
 practice.
 Protection of the rights of Australia's Aboriginals
 (approximately 200,000, or about one-and-one-quarter percent
 of the nation's population) is a demonstrated concern of the
 Government, which recognizes that they are now and have been
 in the past the group most economically and socially
 disadvantaged. As Australia celebrated its 1988 bicentennial
 of European settlement, public attention to Aboriginal
 concerns increased. The Government continues to favor a more
 formal delineation (proposed in 1987) of Aboriginal rights
 than currently exists, and has approved tribal consultations
 aimed at producing a "compact" or "treaty" with the
 Aboriginals.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 Killing for political motives by the Government or by
 Australian political organizations does not occur.
 b. Disappearance
 There have been no instances of political disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Australian law prohibits all these practices, and this
 prohibition is respected.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Australian law prohibits arbitrary arrest and imprisonment.
 This prohibition is respected.

 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Australian law provides for the right to both a fair hearing
 and a fair public trial with an unimpeded right of counsel.
 Free counsel is provided to indigents accused of crimes.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Under Australian law and in practice, no search may be
 conducted without a judicially issued warrant. Australia is a
 nation of liberal political traditions and common law, and the
 Government does not interfere with the privacy of family,
 home, or correspondence.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 A functioning democratic political system, an effective
 judiciary, and a large, diverse, and independent press combine
 to ensure freedom of speech and of the press.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Although Australia does not have a bill of rights, it is a
 signatory to the U.N. International Covenant on Civil and
 Political Rights, which provides for freedom of assembly'and
 expression. These freedoms are respected in practice.
 For a discussion of freedom of association as it applies to
 labor unions, see Section 6.a.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Australians have complete freedom of religion. A provision in
 the Constitution precludes the adoption of an official state
 religion. Australians also maintain numerous links with
 coreligionists abroad.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 There are no restrictions on movement within or outside of
 Australia, including the right of emigration and repatriation.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Australians participate in their government by electing a
 two-chamber Federal Parliament as well as numerous state and
 local bodies. Voting is compulsory in general elections for
 Australians 18 years of age and over; eligible voters who do
 not vote may be fined.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 It is the Government's policy to respond to any communication
 from the United Nations alleging violations of human rights in
 Australia. The Government also allows unimpeded access to all
 international and nongovernmental groups investigating alleged
 human rights violations.

 AUSTRALIA
 Internationally, Australia has been active in promoting human
 rights in the U.N. Working Group on Indigenous Populations and
 in other forums.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 By law, Australia's people have equal access to government
 services without reference to race, sex, religion, language,
 or social status. Basic food, shelter, health care,
 education, and social security benefits are guaranteed for
 all. The Racial Discrimination Act of 1975 prohibits
 discrimination on grounds of race, color, descent, or national
 or ethnic origin.
 However, Aboriginal groups and others claim that the
 Aboriginals suffer widespread discrimination. The Government
 acknowledges that the Aboriginal population is the most
 disadvantaged group in such areas as education, housing,
 health, and employment. In addition to the broad range of
 programs available to all Australians, the Government provides
 services specifically aimed at improving Aboriginal socio-
 economic conditions. In 1987 the Government created a Royal
 Commission to investigate Aboriginal cell deaths, some 53 of
 which were estimated at that time to have occurred since
 1980. Since the Commission's creation, the number of alleged
 cell deaths has grown to more than 100, and the Commission
 continues to take testimony.
 Aboriginal land rights remain a controversial issue. The
 present Federal Government is committed to some form of land
 rights legislation, preferably implemented by the states.
 However, prospects for the enactment of such legislation at
 any level of government appear remote over the short term.
 The Sex Discrimination Act of 1984 prohibits discrimination on
 the basis of sex, marital status, or pregnancy. Women
 constitute 40.17 percent of the Australian work force.
 Although women are beginning to enter jobs previously occupied
 only by men, they remain concentrated in a narrow range of
 occupations predominantly occupied by females and
 characterized by relatively low pay and status. In 1986 the
 Government passed affirmative action legislation obliging
 employers to take corrective action where there is
 underrepresentation of women employees.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Australian law and practice afford workers great freedom to
 establish and to join trade unions, to choose their union
 representatives, and to formulate union programs. These
 rights of association include the right of Australian unions
 to associate with their counterparts in other nations and to
 participate in international labor organizations. Unions are
 extremely active and powerful, representing over half of the
 work force. Australian workers have the right to strike.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 Australian workers are granted the right, by law and in
 practice, to organize and bargain collectively and to be
 represented in negotiating the prevention and settlement of
 disputes with employers. These rights are enforced equally

 AUSTRALIA
 throughout the country. Industrial disputes are arbitrated by
 a system of federal and state industrial courts, in which
 trade unions receive a full and fair hearing. The rights of
 trade union officials are fully protected in both law and
 practice.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Australia has ratified and fully respects International Labor
 Organization (ILO) Convention 105 concerning forced labor.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 Australia has ratified and fully respects the following ILO
 conventions concerning minimum age for employment: Convention
 7 (minimum age); Convention 10 (minimum age for agricultural
 workers); Convention 15 (minimum age for trimmers and
 stokers); Convention 112 (minimum age for fishermen); and
 Convention 123 (minimum age for underground workers). In
 addition, federal and state ministries of labor monitor and
 enforce a complicated netwotk of legislation (which often
 varies from state to state) governing such interactive factors
 as minimum school-leaving age, minimum age to claim
 unemployment benefits, and minimum age to engage in specified
 occupations.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 Australia has long had a tradition that workers should be
 guaranteed a decent standard of living. Australia does not
 have a minimum wage. Instead, differing minimum wage rates
 for individual trades and professions are embodied in a
 comprehensive system of discrete "awards" sanctioned by
 various state and federal commissions. The benchmark minimum
 wage is traditionally taken from the federal metal industry
 award, and is currently the equivalent of US$141 per week.
 Combined with other regularly provided benefits and government
 entitlements for low-income families, this wage provides a
 decent standard of living. In addition, a complex body of
 regulations and commission decisions prescribes the 40-hour
 (often 38-hour) week, paid vacations and sick leave, and
 health and safety standards in the workplace, as well as other
 benefits for the overwhelming majority of Australian workers.
 Compliance with these and other regulations, such as minimum
 age of employment, is actively monitored and enforced by
 federal and state ministries of labor.
