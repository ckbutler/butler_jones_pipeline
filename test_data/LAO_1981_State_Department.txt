 LAOS
 Economic, political, and historical factors, including
 recent efforts to transform Laos according to "Marxist-
 Leninist" norms, give rise to the current unsatisfactory
 human rights situation in the Lao People's Democratic
 Republic. The population of Laos is about three million.
 Approximately half are ethnic Lao, also called "lowland
 Lao"; 20 percent are tribal Thai and 15 percent Phoutheung
 (Kha); mountain tribes constitute another 15 percent (Hmong,
 Yao and others). These people are thinly scattered over
 more than 91,000 square miles of generally rugged terrain.
 They share few common values. National institutions in Laos
 remain weak. There is no constitution, no uniform body of
 law. The current communist government has never even
 attempted to conduct "Leninist style" elections. Literacy
 is about 12-20 percent.
 By any standards, Laos is an extremely poor and underde-
 veloped country, one of the poorest in Asia. An indifferent
 France controlled Laos as a buffer territory until 1954, and
 it made only minimal developmental investments within Laos.
 Since 1954, Laos has found itself on the frontier of the
 communist and non-communist worlds, and lying between the
 major regional rivals, Thailand and Vietnam. As a result,
 parts of Laos were long fought over, and the entire country
 was subjected to serious internal factionalism. Today,
 continuing regional and domestic political tension, low-
 level guerrilla activity, and deteriorating economic condi-
 tions contribute to a siege mentality on the part of the
 narrowly-based communist government, and to an atmosphere of
 suspicion which negatively affects the human rights picture.
 The government of the Lao People's Democratic Republic
 (LPDR), which came to power in Vientiane in December 1975,
 calls itself revolutionary and communist. Its founders grew
 up under the political wing of Ho Chi Minh, and remain
 beholden to Vietnamese support to stay in firm control.
 Upon taking over in 1975, the new regime arrested significant
 numbers of Royal Lao government officials for "reeducation"
 in camps remote from the capital. Although many other
 officials of the royal government remained at their posts
 through the transition, and continue to do so, this policy
 frightened numerous individuals and families of the small
 middle class group, which also included Chinese and Vietnamese
 urban traders and artisans. Since 1975, there has been an
 exodus of probably 300,000 persons (or about 10 percent of
 the population). The departure of a significant number of
 the skilled/middle class has held back economic progress.
 Annual per capital income is probably less than one hundred
 dollars.
 In part because of the government's preoccupation with
 political and military security, the extremely small number
 of trained people available to it, and the government's
 mistrust of many of the educated persons who have remained
 in the country, the government's weakened administrative
 structure has made little headway. The nation's hilly
 geography, pronounced ethnic cleavages, monsoon climate, and
 the populace's current apathy all make progress difficult.
 The government, regarding itself as "revolutionary" and
 purportedly interested in the advance of whole classes of
 people, exhibits little specific concern for individual
 human rights. The individual citizen is subject to the
 programs and plans of the state and the communist party.
 Lao culture itself has, however, a broadly humane streak and
 
 (on8)
 
 
 634
 occasionally this factor serves to mitigate the problems
 faced by the individual. The comnmunist takeover in Laos was
 accompanied by far less violence against traditional cultural
 values than was the case anywhere else in Indochina, or in
 all of communist Asia.
 In recent years, there has been limited improvement in some
 aspects of human rights in Laos, though very serious short-
 comings persist in key areas. Substantial numbers of
 prisoners have been released from reeducation camps. While
 their release may be due in some measure to government
 relaxation and concern for its human rights image, the
 principal motive for freeing them is probably to use their
 skills in the government's technical and administrative work
 to replace the many Lao who have fled the country. A few
 were released because of advanced age or serious health
 problems.
 1.   Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 There has been no report of torture for the past three
 years.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 Refugees have described conditions in reeducation camps for
 political prisoners as primitive, with seriously limited
 medical facilities and poor food. The inmates reportedly
 grow much of their own food. These sources state that the
 prisoners receive the same salary ($1.50 per month) as a
 private in the Lao army. Families are generally able to
 exchange letters with detainees; in some cases, wives are
 allowed to join or visit husbands at the camps for extended
 periods, and at at least one camp certain detainees reportedly
 have been allowed to visit family members living nearby.
 (This practice was stopped in late 1981 because many detainees
 overstayed their leave or disappeared.) Lao government
 officials have publicly denied reports of mistreatment of
 persons in the reeducation camps. Although camp inmates,
 many of whom are former members of the small educated elite,
 lead a life which is no more difficult than that led by most
 rural Lao, it is unquestionably hard on the inmates, and
 many have been confined for more than five years without
 trial and with very little external communication.
 Laos also has normal prisons and prison work camps where
 those convicted of crimes are held, together with some
 persons accused of undefined political offenses. There have
 been a number of reports of capital punishment, the most
 recent being publicly announced death sentences for treason
 and robbery in July of 1981. Official policy calls for
 execution of the leaders of resistance groups. Every so
 often, Lao authorities announce the execution of a few
 "reactionaries" charged with sabotage activities. Reeduca-
 tion camp releasees and refugees have reported that govern-
 ment authorities have executed at least 25 high-ranking
 former officials of the royal government at a "special
 reeducation camp." The executions by shooting reportedly
 occurred In late 1978 and may have been carried out in
 connection with an unsuccessful attempt to escape from
 prison. Several releasees report witnessing public executions
 by firing squad in 1977, 1978 and 1979 of captured escapees
 from northern and southern camps.
 
 
 635
 C. Disappearances
 Reports of abductions and secret arrests are rare in Laos.
 The fates of those who are arrested by security forces,
 however, are sometimes kept from loved ones. In the case of
 reeducation camp inmates, families of some had been told
 that their kin were still alive only to find out later that
 they had long before succumbed to disease or had been
 executed. There are no measures to enforce official account-
 ability in this regard; relatives and friends remain at the
 mercy of government officials for news of arrestees.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 The Lao government continues to maintain a multilayered
 system of reeducation and rehabilitation camps throughout
 much of the country.
 Not long after the establishment of the Lao communist state,
 several thousand Lao citizens (as well as a few foreign
 residents) were arrested for their association with the
 previous government or the United States. They were sent,
 without public hearing or trial, to remote camps for re-
 education. These camps exhibit differing degrees of isola-
 tion and coercion, but detailed information is lacking. The
 precise number of political prisoners is not known, but it
 probably remains the highest on a per capita basis of the
 Indochinese countries. Some reeducation camps were closed
 in 1979, but detention sites of various sorts reportedly
 still number more than twenty. People released from some
 camps have been required to remain in remote parts of the
 country. There reportedly is a "special camp" located close
 to the Vietnamese border for persons who are resistant to
 reeducation.
 Frequent releases of reeducation camp inmates earlier this
 year and the integration of some into the work force en-
 couraged the belief that some or all the camps would be
 closed and this form of reeducation ended in the near
 future. Releases ended in May, however, after many of the
 releasees fled to Thailand. Several freed inmates were
 reported to have been rearrested in Vientiane and sent back
 to reeducation camps after authorities determined that they
 had obtained freedom through "improper" methods. Some
 releases were made again in November. Amnesty International
 Report 1981 expresses concern about the continuing detention
 without charge or trial of thousands of people held in
 "reeducation" camps. It also expresses concern about new
 arrests and the lack of legal safeguards for those detained
 on political grounds.
 Those accused of hostility to the regime or of socially
 undesirable habits (prostitution, drug abuse, idleness, and
 "wrong thought") are sent to rehabilitation centers without
 trial, and can be held there for indefinite periods. Most
 of the persons have been allowed to return after several
 years of hard labor, political indoctrination, and admission
 of guilt. Under the Lao government's concept of justice,
 and in the absence of a constitution or a codified body of
 law, those undergoing reeducation or rehabilitation are not
 necessarily charged with specific crimes.
 The Lao government attempts to portray the rehabilitation
 camps as learning and indoctrination centers. In order to
 be released, one must have "reformed" and recanted past
 mistakes. Persons are still arrested for "social evils" and
 sent to "rehabilitation camps" for periods from a few months
 
 
 636
 to several years.
 The Lao three years ago promulgated interim rules and re-
 gulations for the arrest and trial of those accused of
 specific crimes, including armed resistance to the govern-
 ment, primarily to correct the haphazard way in which
 lower-level authorities were handling their criminal and
 judicial duties. Amnesty International Report 1981, however,
 expresses concern about the continuing absence of legislation
 providing safeguards against arbitrary arrest and detention
 despite reassuring statements made by government officials.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Those confined in "seminars" for reeducation or rehabilita-
 tlon are not technically considered to have committed any
 crime; consequently, they have no recourse to trial. Their
 period of reeducation is determined by government authori-
 ties, based on their progress in becoming "new socialist
 men."
 The Lao communist government has admitted that in its early
 days a number of individuals, accused of specific crimes,
 had been wrongfully confined or even executed without trial.
 There was an attempt to correct this situation, and a rudi-
 mentary system of rules for criminal investigation and trial
 were distributed in October 1978. However, even if those
 regulations were always followed, they would provide no real
 opportunity for the accused to defend himself. Rather the
 government has issued instructions on how to investigate,
 prosecute, and punish wrongdoers. There is some provision
 for appeal, with the key exception that important political
 cases tried by people's courts are without appeal. Death
 sentences must be cleared by the ministerial council. Lao
 regulations call for judgment to be given in public. This
 constitutes, in effect, a public announcement of the sen-
 tence; it is not a public trial.
 f. Invasion of the Home
 Under government regulations, search of private homes should
 require orders from the prosecution department, ministry of
 Justice or from the concerned provincial prosecution service.
 The search is supposed to be conducted in front of the
 accused or other witnesses, and a written inventory madq of
 confiscated goods. Except in urgent cases, house searches
 are required to be conducted during the day. In practice,
 these limitations are sometimes violated. Even in cases in
 which they are followed, they provide little protection for
 the individual, since search and seizure are authorized by
 the security bureaus themselves, rather than by an impartial
 judicial authority. Realizing that he has no guaranteed
 recourse under law, a person whose home has been arbitrarily
 entered and searched will, if not arrested on the spot,
 often attempt to flee the country.
 2.   Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 A. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 The Lao press is entirely government-controlled. It is
 described as an instrument for disseminating government and
 party positions. Written or spoken opposition to the
 government is not permitted, and some persons who have
 engaged In such activity have been jailed.
 Traditionally, Laos has considered itself a Buddhist nation,
 with'only a few adherents of other religions. The government
 
 
 637
 has taken over some Buddhist and Christian places of worship
 for use as seminar halls or warehouses. Otherwise, the
 practice of Buddhism and Christianity has been allowed to
 continue relatively freely. The government has begun a
 long-term effort to subvert gently the role of religion by
 carefully controlling the induction of young monks and by
 compelling the Buddhist clergy to propagate some aspects of
 Marxist-Leninist doctrine.
 Donations to support monks are tax exempt. Monks are the
 only remaining social group still entitled to special
 honorific terms of address. Religious festivals are per-
 mitted to take place without hindrance. Young people continue
 to engage in religious activities on a large scale.
 b. Freedom of Movement within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration and Repatriation
 Lao citizens are required to seek permission from the
 authorities for all internal travel of any distance. Permis-
 sion for internal travel has tightened up in recent months
 in the wake of increased insurgent activity in the country-
 side. A curfew was recently reimplemented in the capital
 and is more strictly enforced. Government officials have
 cited threats of "disorders" created by "reactionary" ele-
 ments as the reason for the restrictions.
 Foreign travel is permitted for officials and students in
 government-approved programs. Border crossing permits are
 available for those with business in Thailand. Although the
 Lao government has said that those wishing to emigrate will
 be allowed to do so, as a practical matter legal emigration
 is rarely authorized and reportedly involves substantial
 payments when it is. In fact, tens of thousands, some of
 whom could now qualify as legal immigrants, have fled Laos
 clandestinely. Since.1975, about 250,000 Lao have been
 registered as refugees in Thailand, and it is likely that a
 further significant number have slipped into Thailand with-
 out registering. In all, about ten percent of the population
 has fled since 1975.
 Some of those fleeing are fired upon and some killed by Lao,
 Vietnamese or Thai border patrols as they attempt to cross
 the river. Many Lao caught seeking to leave illegally have
 been imprisoned, although in some cases they have only been
 sent for short indoctrination seminars and then released.
 The Lao and Thai governments have agreed to take back, on a
 case by case basis, those of its citizens who have illegally
 crossed into the other country and wish to return home.
 From May 1980 to mid-December 1981, over 670 Lao refugees
 have voluntarily returned to Laos under the auspices of the
 United Nations High Commissioper for Refugees (UNHCR) in
 cooperation with the Lao and Thai governments. Upon return,
 the homecomers receive several days of political indoctrination
 and are then released to return to their homes. The UNHCR
 provides basic necessities upon immediate return and monitors
 treatment and living conditions thereafter.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Local elections were held by the new authorities in the
 autumn of 1975, before the actual establishment of the LPDR.
 Voters in villages and districts were allowed a choice from
 a list of candidates who had been pre-selected by the state/
 party organization. Provincial and national representatives
 were reportedly chosen by those locally elected officials,
 although the latter process was not made public. There hava
 
 
 638
 been no national elections held (or even discussed) since
 the Lao People's Democratic Republic was established in
 December 1975. There is no constitution in Laos. The
 ministry of justice has for the past four or five years re-
 portedly been drafting one, but little is currently being
 said on the subject.
 The Lao government is attempting to overcome traditional
 antagonistic lowland Lao attitudes toward minority groups
 and to integrate these groups into the Lao nation, though
 this reportedly sometimes requires coercion. Lao men and
 women are traditionally treated equitably. Women are
 currently being encouraged to take an increasing part in
 economic and state-controlled political activity.
 There is no evidence that the government is seeking to
 destroy an ethnic group like the Hmong (Meo) in its entirety.
 The Hmong themselves are split along clan lines. Many were
 strongly anti-coaunist, but others were on the side of the
 Lao communists and Vietnamese. The government is equally
 repressive toward all groups that had fought against its
 takeover--most especially toward those who continue to
 resist its authority by force of arms. The war with the
 Hmong resistance has been brutal; but the main difference
 between the Hmong and other resistance groups is that the
 Hmong have strong military traditions, and some Hmong have
 attempted to defend specific tribal areas. There is a
 traditional ethnic antipathy between the lowland peoples,
 like the Lao, and .the highlanders, like the Hmong. Because
 the latter were heavily armed, Vietnamese and Lao armed
 forces have conducted military operations to dislodge Hmong
 fighters from their strongholds.
 The current government would like to resettle some ethnic
 minorities who now inhabit mountainous areas by moving them
 into the lowlands, where they would be under better government
 control, and where they could engage in settled agricultural
 production. Ending inefficient slash-and-burn techniques
 and replacement of other crops for the traditional cash crop
 of opium are added government rationales for resettlement.
 Some tribal groups have been forcibly relocated. Refugees
 report that large numbers of women and children were killed
 in bombing raids, and that captured Hmong soldiers were
 dealt with harshly and in some cases killed.
 Reports of attacks against the Hmong using unknown lethal
 chemical agents continue unabated. Since 1976 these reports
 have emanated from Hmong and Lao refugees. This year,
 however, new evidence from Laos and elsewhere in Southeast
 Asia lends strong weight to the probability that lethal
 biological/chemical agents known as mycotoxins (and perhaps
 others) have been used against Hmong tribespeople within
 Laos. These charges have been denied by the Lao government.
 International efforts continue to gather information and to
 express deep concern over these disturbing reports. A
 special United Nations committee of experts is conducting an
 impartial investigation into these reports, and will make
 its report to the UN General Assembly in the fall of 1982.
 The United States has urged-the Lao government to accede to
 the Geneva Protocol of 1925 on such weapons, but has received
 no response from the Lao government.
 There also has been an ongoing military campaign to suppress
 resistance from lowland Lao groups, mainly in southern Laos
 and around Vientiane. Many of the insurgents appear to be
 former royal army troops. Both sides are reported to use
 brutal tactics, with the anti-government terrorists attempt-
 ing assassination and ambush of Lao government, Vietnamese,
 
 
 639
 and other communist military and civilian personnel.
 Deterioriation in Sino-Lao relations has resulted in increas-
 ing Lao government suspicion and surveillance of local
 Chinese. So far, however, there has been no overt policy of
 expulsion or persecution. The Chinese school in Vientiane
 remains open, and the Chinese Association continues in
 subdued operation. Chinese merchants are still in business,
 although a majority of them have left the country, in reaction
 to harsh communist economic policies. Departures by this
 group continue. The government allows Chinese to emigrate
 rather freely.
 3.   Government Attitude and Record Regarding International
 and Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Lao government allows little independent travel by
 persons capable of investigating human rights violations.
 Without specific permission, foreigners cannot travel outside
 Vientiane.
 Visits to.Laos by foreign journalists are infrequent.
 Journalists' requests for visas are sometimes ignored and
 reporters who do visit Laos are accorded little access to
 responsible officials.
 Within Vientiane, foreign diplomatic and other observers are
 able to talk relatively freely to a cross section of the
 city population and tribal groups who visit the city to
 trade. There have been several official visitors to model
 rehabilitation centers, but no travel by outsiders has been-
 authorized to the more remote reeducation camps.
 A number of UN agencies are present in Laos, but they have
 not been mandated to observe or report on human rights
 conditions. In December 1980 and 1981, the United Nations
 General Assembly overwhelmingly passed resolutions calling
 for An impartial investigation of reports that the USSR and
 Vietnam are using weapons in Laos and elsewhere, but thus
 far the Lao government has denied entry into Laos to the
 special UN experts committee implementing the UN General
 Asoembly resolution. No group is known to have visited Laos
 specifically to investigate human rights conditions there.
 LAo'officials have been willing to discuss human rights
 issues with U.S. officials, and Laos responded to the 1979
 Human Rights Report with a diplomatic note conveying their
 comments point by point on that report.
 4.   Economic and Social Circumstances
 About 85 percent of the population of Laos is engaged in
 subsistence agriculture, The per capita GNP is estimated at
 under 100 dollars. The country's economic problems are
 further complicated by inadequate internal transportation
 and isolation from the sea. The avowed aim of the government
 is to improve the economic self-sufficiency of the country
 and the condition of the people by a socialist transformation
 of the economy, including collectivization of agriculture.
 The government has outlined an ambitious program of economic
 deyelopment with emphasis on agriculture and forestry. In
 early 1978, instances of attempted coercion of some farmers
 to join agricultural cooperatives were reported, causing for
 the first time some lowland Lao farmers to leave the country.
 According to the Lao government, this coercion was the
 Kesult of lack of understanding by both cadre and farmers,
 And was not government policy. The formation of new coopera-
 tives has been halted, and many old cooperatives are crum-
 bling and reverting to private agriculture.
 
 
 640
 The government has nationalized most industries And has at
 times tried to impose strict controls on urban private
 enterprise. The latest instance of such measures was in May
 when urban merchants were slapped with retroactive taxes
 which caused some of them to flee to Thailand. Private
 trade is allowed to continue, however, by virtue of the fact
 that it still constitutes the principal and most efficient
 manner for providing for the people's economic well-being.
 Laos has been experiencing serious foreign exchange difficul-
 ties this year. Domestic difficulties, natural and man-
 made, have reduced timber and coffee exports. In addition,
 the present government has been increasingly diverting these
 commodities and minerals to Soviet bloc countries to pay for
 aid debts, thus sacrificing desperately needed hard currency
 earnings. As a result, Laos has difficulty paying its
 import bills for many necessities, including fuel.
 The health picture is poor. Infant mortality is about 200
 per thousand. Life expectancy is approximately 40 years.
 Only two out of three children reach age four. The overall
 crude death rate is 22.8 per thousand, in comparison with an
 estimated overall population growth rate of 1.4 percent.
 There are perhaps no more than 150 physicians in the country.
 Laos has only four hospitals of any significant size. Major
 causes of premature death in Laos are gastrointestinal
 diseases deriving from malaria, respiratory infections,
 malnutrition and unsafe drinking water. The government is
 seriously attempting to improve the health situation by
 training more cadre in basic health care, improving water
 supplies, modernizing 13 provincial hospitals, constructing
 clinics in all districts, inoculating against cholera and
 other diseases and promoting adult education on preventive
 hygiene.
 The Lao authorities are continuing a campaign to wipe out
 illiteracy. AID experts estimate that more than 80 percent
 of the population are unable to read and write. It is
 difficult to assess the success of this campaign, although
 the government has made sweeping claims that illiteracy has
 been eliminated in entire districts.   The government carries
 out an intensive program of adult education with the primary
 aim of indoctrinating adults along "socialist" lines.
 Approximately 85 percent of children aged 5-14 regularly
 attend school. The effectiveness of teachers is necessarily
 limited, however, since their own training has usually been
 only rudimentary.
 Emphasis in higher education is placed on training technicians
 and engineers to help meet the great need for such personnel
 in development projects. Hundreds of Lao students are sent
 abroad each year for training in the USSR, Vietnam, and
 Eastern Europe. The pool of trained manpower in Laos,
 however, continues to incur losses as skilled workers flee
 the country as refugees.
