 VANUATU
 Vanuatu, the former New Hebrides, is a South Pacific island
 nation with an estimated population of over 140,000. One of
 three countries comprising Melanesia, Vanuatu became
 independent in 1980, following more than 70 years of joint
 British-French rule. It has a parliamentary system of
 government with a prime minister and a 46-member parliament.
 Independence was accompanied by temporary political turbulence,
 including an attempt at secession, which left a legacy of
 suspicion towards outside interference. Most of the internal
 strains from the 1980 secessionist rebellion have now subsided,
 although island and regional loyalties remain strong.
 Political legitimacy in Vanuatu is based on majority rule,
 supported by both Melanesian and Western tradition. The first
 general election since independence, held in November 1983,
 was vigorously contested and democratically conducted. A
 second parliamentary election, also vigorously and
 democratically contested, took place in November 1987.
 Vanuatu underwent a period of domestic turmoil in 1988
 following a violent protest march in May in Port Vila, led by
 a government minister, against land policies of the Prime
 Minister and the ruling Vanua'aku Party. The subsequent
 ejection from parliament of the minister and his supporters,
 along with most members of the opposition, led to a
 constitutional crisis.
 Demanding general elections, major opposition elements
 boycotted byelections held to fill the seats of expelled
 members. On December 16, when the newly constituted
 Parliament convened, the President, a largely ceremonial
 figure, announced that he was dismissing it and appointing an
 interim government. The Parliament continued to meet, and the
 Prime Minister and the leader of the Parliamentary opposition
 denounced the President's actions. On December 19, the
 Vanuatu Supreme Court pronounced those actions
 unconstitutional. The President, the members of the aborted
 interim government, and various of their supporters have been
 arrested on charges such as: sedition, incitement to mutiny,
 unlawful assembly, etc., and at year's end were awaiting trial.
 Historically the courts in Vanuatu have been independent and
 solicitous of individual rights. In the December government
 crisis, they appeared to be continuing in that manner. The
 police and military continued under civilian control.
 The Vanuatu economy resembles that of other Pacific island
 states in its dependence on international trade and its
 vulnerability to shifts in world market prices. In the past,
 tourism earned more foreign exchange than all exports combined.
 The May 1988 riot and subsequent political uncertainty further
 depressed the already declining tourist industry and
 discouraged foreign investment. Despite the political
 turbulence during the year, the human rights situation in
 Vanuatu remained favorable.

 VANUATU
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Constitutional guarantees against torture and cruel, inhuman,
 or degrading treatment are observed in practice and enforced
 by the courts. Prisoners also have recourse to an Ombudsman.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 There were no reports of arbitrary arrests ink Vanuatu. Arrest
 is by warrant. There is no exile. Suspects have free access
 to a lawyer of their choice. The constitutional provision
 that suspects will be informed of charges and given a speedy
 hearing before a judge is observed.
 With regard to forced or compulsory labor, see Section 6-.c.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The courts uphold constitutional provisions for a fair public
 trial, presumption of innocence until guilt is proven,
 prohibition against double jeopardy, the right of habeas
 corpus, and appeal to the Supreme Court. The courts are free
 of military or executive interference. There were no reports
 of arbitrary or unfair exercise of judicial authority in,.1988.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Sanctity of the home and family and privacy of correspondence
 are observed.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Although freedom of expression is provided for in the
 Constitution, the Government publishes and controls the
 country's only national newspaper and manages the national
 radio station. Following the May 1988 riot, the opposition
 alleged that its members and their views were denied free
 access to the government-run media. There is no independent
 newspaper or radio.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 There are no restrictions on the formation of political
 parties or other groups in Vanuatu. There are two main
 political parties and several smaller ones.
 For a discussion of freedom of association as it applies to
 labor unions, see Section 6.a.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Freedom of religion is protected by law and respected in
 practice. Missionaries of various Christian denominations
 work without restriction.

 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 All Vanuatu citizens are free to travel internally and
 externally. There are no restrictions on returning home from
 abroad.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Vanuatu is a multiparty democracy. Numerous candidates
 competed in the parliamentary elections in 1983 and 1987; both
 the campaign and voting were considered by outside observers
 to have been fair. Elections to provincial and local councils
 have also been freely contested and fair. However, to an
 extent unusual among Pacific island states, the ruling
 Vanua'aku Party is the primary policymaking body and its
 decisions are implemented by the Government. The Vanua'aku
 Party in the past has been known to use government power to
 restrict opposition political activity, for example, by
 denying other parties the use of the government-owned radio
 and press. Also, there have been reports, in the aftermath of
 the November 1987 elections, of instances of harassment
 against individual communities suspected of having supported
 opposition candidates. Most observers inside and outside of
 Vanuatu viewed the May 1988 riot as an attempt to bring down
 the Government and Prime Minister by force. The move was not
 supported by the majority of citizens, and the riot was
 brought under control by the police and the Vanuatu mobile
 force (a paramilitary group).
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 There were no charges of human rights violations in 1988.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Most of the population is comprised of Melanesians whose
 ancestors migrated from New Guinea. There are small
 minorities of Chinese, Fijians, Vietnamese, Tongans, and
 others; most minority groups are concentrated in the two towns
 and on a few plantations. There is no discrimination against
 these minorities. Although there have been rumors of corrupt
 practices by members of the ruling Vanua'aku party, there is
 no evidence to suggest a pattern of discrimination in the
 Government's provision of basic services.
 While women have equal rights under the law, they are only
 slowly emerging from a traditional culture characterized by
 male dominance, a general reluctance to educate women, and a
 widespread belief that women should devote themselves
 primarily to child rearing. Nevertheless, an increasing
 number of women are finding work in the unskilled, semi-
 skilled, and social occupations. Most employed women tend to
 be in secretarial or clerical jobs at the lower end of the pay
 scale. There are a few women in positions that have
 traditionally been considered male dominated, such as the
 police. Several women hold senior positions in the civil
 service, but otherwise women have not found their way into
 positions of leadership.

 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Vanuatti's workers have the right to organize unions, choose
 their own representatives, and to strike. Strike activity has
 been minimal, the most recent strikes having taken place in
 1985. The fundamental legislation establishing the right of
 workers to organize into unions, setting out the scope of
 union activity, and providing for the arbitration and
 conciliation of labor disputes consists of the Trade Union Act
 of 1983 and the Trade Disputes Act of 1983. There are some 20
 trade unions, grouped under an umbrella organization, the
 Vanuatu Trade Union Congress, which is a member of the
 International Confederation of Free Trade Unions.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 Unions in Vanuatu have and use the right to organize and
 bargain collectively, a right that is exercised frequently.
 The high percentage of the population still engaged in
 subsistence agriculture and fishing, however, serves as a
 deterrent to extensive union activity. Labor laws and
 regulations are applied uniformly throughout Vanuatu.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 There is no forced labor.
 d   Minimum Age for Employment of Children.
 Children under 12 years of age are not permitted to work
 outside of family-owned agriculture, where many children do
 assist their parents. Employment of children 12 to 18 years
 of age is restricted by occupational category and conditions
 of labor--such as shipping and nighttime employment. There
 are no prohibitions for those over the age of 18. In general,
 however, the high level of adult unemployment discourages any
 resort to child labor.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.
 Minimum wage for Vanuatu is about 50 cents per hour-for
 nonagricultural workers, and about 45 cents per hour for
 agricultural. The large majority of workers are not in the
 wage economy and are thus outside the scope of minimum wage
 laws. For the remainder, these minimums provide an adequate
 standard of living within the local context. There are laws
 to regulate the rights to sick leave, annual vacations, and.
 other conditions of service.
