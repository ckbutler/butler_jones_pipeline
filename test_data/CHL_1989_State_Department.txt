 CHILE
 The transition to democracy, begun with the October 5, 1988,
 plebiscite which denied President Pinochet 8 more years in
 office, continued with the December 14, 1989, election of a
 civilian President and Congress. The elections were
 characterized by international observers as free and fair.
 The new President and Congress will assume office in March
 1990; until then, General Pinochet will remain President, and
 the military junta will continue to exercise the legislative
 function. There is a separate judicial branch, but crimes
 relating to state security continue to be heard in military
 tribunals. In a plebiscite held July 30, amendments to the
 1980 Constitution were approved by 85 percent of those voting.
 The uniformed national police, the 28,000-man Carabineros, is
 under the jurisdiction of the Minister of Defense and has
 primary responsibility for public order and safety, crime
 control, and border security. The 5,000-man Investigations
 Police, also under the jurisdiction of the Minister of
 Defense, is responsible for controlling and investigating
 serious crime. The National Information Center (CNI),
 responsible for internal and external intelligence-gathering,
 is part of the Ministry of the Interior, but the President
 exercises significant personal control. The majority of this
 2,500-man force is composed of military personnel. The
 85,000-man armed forces assert a role as the ultimate
 guarantor of constitutional order and, in keeping with
 longstanding tradition and under the terms of the current
 election law, are responsible for ensuring the security of
 voting places during elections.
 Chile's economy is largely based on free market principles and
 has a dynamic and growing export sector. Copper is Chile's
 major source of foreign exchange, followed by fresh fruits and
 fish meal. 1989 marked the sixth consecutive year of positive
 real economic growth and the fourth consecutive year of annual
 growth in excess of 5 percent. As a result, real wages have
 increased and, while unemployment remains high in urban areas,
 on the whole has decreased. Chile continues to make
 substantial progress in overcoming its foreign debt problem.
 The human rights environment in Chile improved dramatically
 during 1989, although there were continuing instances of
 abuses. Freedom from arbitrary arrest continued to be
 undermined by vaguely defined and far-reaching state security
 laws. Torture and kidnapings were considerably reduced in
 comparison to previous years. Twenty-four persons, among them
 9 Carabineros, a retired military officer, and a spokesman for
 the Movement of the Revolutionary Left (MIR), were killed for
 political reasons. The absence of any resolution to
 longstanding cases of serious human rights abuses, among them
 the 1976 murder in Washington, D.C., of exiled oppostion
 leader Orlando Letelier and his American assistant Ronni
 Moffitt, continued to concern both Chilean and international
 human rights organizations.
 Restrictions on freedom of speech and press have been greatly
 reduced in law and have largely disappeared in practice. The
 Government announced it would no longer accept a Special
 Rapporteur of the United Nations Human Rights Commission
 (UNHRC) after the incumbent resigned in April. Delegations
 from other human rights organizations, such as Amnesty
 International (AI), Americas Watch, and the International
 Human Rights Law Group, visited Chile during the year and in
 
 
 498
 some instances were given permission to visit prisons and
 individual prisoners.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 Deaths and injuries resulting from political violence
 continued during 1989. According to the Vicariate of
 Solidarity, the human rights organization of the Catholic
 Church, 24 persons had died in acts of political violence as
 of December 31. The independent Chilean Human Rights
 Commission (CHRC) indicated that 30 deaths had occurred due to
 political violence as of October 30. (For a discussion of the
 bases of the statistics provided by these two groups, see
 Section 4). Of the 24 deaths listed by the Vicariate as
 politically motivated, 10 of the victims were members of the
 military and security forces. The Lautaro Youth Movement
 (MJL) took responsibility for ambushing and assassinating nine
 Carabineros, and the Manuel Rodriquez Patriotic Front (FPMR)
 killed an army officer during an assault on an army air
 station in August.
 A member of the FPMR unit attacking the air station died in
 the attempt. Another FPMR member died in September when,
 officials claim, he activated a grenade following a shoot-out
 with Carabineros; others claim he was shot. A member of the
 MIR was killed in August in a failed assassination attempt
 against a CNI official. A shopkeeper, who may have been
 mistaken for his twin who worked for the CNI, was killed by
 presumed members of the MIR in January. A young member of the
 Communist Party was shot while being pursued by Carabineros
 for painting slogans on a public wall early in 1989; the
 police maintain he was killed, and a policeman wounded, by
 gunshots from a passing car, but the victim's family claim the
 Carabineros were responsible. In June a former air force
 officer, who had been charged with human rights abuses but
 whose case was dismissed because it was covered by the 1978
 Amnesty Law, was assassinated by the FP14R.
 Jecar Neghme, a spokesman for the political faction of the
 MIR, was assassinated on September 4 as he walked from his
 party's headquarters. Although the Minister of Government
 cited (but did not divulge) evidence suggesting Neghme's death
 was prompted by differences between the political and armed
 factions of MIR, most observers believe he was the victim of a
 rightwing group with ties to the security forces, perhaps in
 reprisal for the killing of security officials. There is,
 however, no clear evidence implicating any individual or group.
 In July a pregnant woman was shot and killed when Carabineros
 attempted to disperse a group of demonstrators which had
 symbolically seized public land. According to government
 reports, Communist or other leftwing terrorist groups in 1989
 caused 5 deaths and 69 personal injuries in attacks which
 included 273 bombings, one of which occurred across the street
 from the U.S. Embassy and 6 of which occurred at
 American-Chilean binational centers. There were 12 attacks,
 including bombings, of Mormon churches. Rightwing terrorist
 groups continued to issue threats against journalists, human
 rights activists, and political figures. In November the car
 of journalist Monica Gonzalez was bombed and the home of the
 
 
 499
 director of the magazine Analysis was set on fire. Also in
 November, a cable television station and the offices of Radio
 Mineria were bombed, allegedly by leftist terrorist groups. A
 special investigator was appointed to investigate these
 attacks on the media.
 In January two Carabineros were charged with killing three
 persons on June 30, 1986, and another was charged with
 covering up the crime, known as the "Calle Mamina case."
 Allegedly, the police had attempted to cast the deaths as
 suicides during a confrontation. In March, a military
 investigating judge recommended a finding of guilty against
 two Carabinero officials in the torture-death of a young
 student in 1985, and against another official for covering up
 the crime, calling for a sentence of 6 years for the first
 two, and 4 for the latter. However, as of December 31, the
 military judge had not ruled on the matter. In August, the
 Military Tribunal confirmed the December 1988 manslaughter
 verdict against an army officer for the 1986 death by burning
 of Rodrigo Rojas, a young Chilean who had lived in the United
 States, and the near-fatal burning of his companion, Carmen
 Gloria Quintana. A suspended sentence of 300 days in jail was
 also confirmed. Human rights groups, including the Vicariate,
 denounced the leniency of the sentence.
 b. Disappearance
 Human rights organizations report that politically motivated
 kidnapings by private or paramilitary groups continued in
 1989, but the number of incidents were lower and the duration
 of the detentions shorter than in past years. The Vicariate
 reported 7 kidnapings in Santiago as of December 31, and 4 in
 other parts of the country as of August 31; the CHRC reported
 18 through October 31. Because of the vehicles used and the
 boldness of the operations, some official complicity is
 suspected. There were no known arrests or prosecutions in any
 of these kidnaping cases. Rightwing extremist groups may have
 been involved in numerous kidnaping threats against persons
 associated with political opposition organizations, including
 journalists, judges, political leaders, and human rights
 activists. Charges continued to surface that members of the
 security and military forces, not always acting on orders,
 were involved in some of these groups.
 During 1989 there were no reports of persons disappearing
 following detention by security forces or by persons suspected
 of being official security agents. Investigations into the
 last reported case of disappearance, that of five men in
 September 1987, are inactive and appear to have been suspended.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 There was a significant reduction in the use of torture in
 1989. The Vicariate reported 24 instances as of December 31,
 but the figure only covers cases in Santiago; the CHRC
 reported 48 as of October 31. Agreements concluded in 1987 by
 the Investigations Police, the CNI, and the Carabineros with
 the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), appear to
 have reduced the incidence of torture and lesser forms of
 police brutality. The agreements, which have generally been
 honored, allow the ICRC to visit anyone detained by the
 Carabineros and Investigations Police for violations of state
 security laws. The ICRC is notified immediately when persons
 are. detained for politically motivated crimes and is allowed
 
 
 500
 to visit the detainees after 24 hours of detention and before
 the detainees are released or brought before the courts.
 However, the ICRC is not allowed to visit detainees if the
 prosecutor in the case orders them held for the 10-day periods
 of isolation provided for under the Antiterrorist Law.
 Although there were instances when periods of incommunication
 were extended beyond 10 days, this practice was considerably
 reduced in 1989. The CNI continued to abide by the 1987
 agreement with the ICRC to turn over persons it arrested to
 the Carabineros or the Investigations Police. One of the
 constitutional amendments approved' in the July 30 plebiscite
 gave the status of constitutional law to international
 agreements such as the U.N. and the O.A.S. Conventions on
 Torture, signed by Chile in 1987 and ratified in September
 1988. However, the Government attached reservations which
 have the effect of denying any international efforts to ensure
 compliance.
 Government officials deny that torture is used or authorized'
 and assert that charges of alleged mistreatment by members of
 the security forces are always investigated. In May, 10
 members of the Investigations Police were indicted for
 torturing 2 prisoners held for politically motivated crimes,
 and in June 2 Carabineros were indicted for torturing a
 suspect in April 1988.
 Judicial investigations of torture are seldom concluded, due
 in large part to the refusal of some state security
 organizations to comply with court orders to make security
 agents available to the courts for questioning. Last year's
 Country Report on Human Rights Practices noted that Judge Rene
 Garcia Villegas, who had publicly denounced the repeated
 failure of CNI officials to cooperate with his investigations
 into torture incidents and who had opined that torture cases
 investigated by military judges implied impunity for those
 charged, was suspended for 15 day's with half pay. In October
 1989, his offices were ransacked and the warning "Be Careful"
 was scrawled on the window. He has received repeated threats
 against his life. Early in January 1990, Judge Garcia was
 rated "unqualified" by the Supreme Court for the second year
 in a row, forcing his retirement, unless an appeal of the
 decision is successful. The Supreme Court ruled that Garcia's
 public statements criticizing the behavior of his judicial
 colleagues for failing to pursue vigorously charges of torture
 by security forces violated public norms.
 Human rights leaders agree that Carabinero efforts to avoid
 the use of unnecessary force continued in 1989. Opposition
 political figures generally agree that Carabinero conduct
 during legally held political demonstrations has been
 generally evenhanded; detentions during rallies were
 relatively few, given the large numbers of participants
 involved in what was a very active political year, and most of
 those held were released within 24 hours.
 Activities of some Carabineros, however, detracted from that
 organization's improved image. During a demonstration in
 July, for example, Carabineros used excessive force in
 evicting "squatters" in a poor Santiago neighborhood, and in
 the confusion shot and killed a pregnant woman.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Under Article 19 of the Constitution, civilian and military
 courts may order detention for 5 days, and up to 10 days when
 
 
</pre>
<pre>
 501
 terrorist acts are alleged to be involved. In some cases
 involving special military prosecutors, detainees have had
 their access to lawyers limited even after the prosecutor
 formally charged them. The ad hoc military prosecutors
 continued to order arrests of persons suspected of being
 linked to four cases under their purview: the discovery of
 arms caches in 1986, the attempted assassination of President
 Pinochet in 1986, the kidnaping of an army colonel in 1987,
 and the 1986 assault on a bakery in which a Carabinero
 official was killed. None of those arrested in these cases
 has been brought to trial. By January 1990 three of these
 cases reached the summary stage; in each one the investigating
 judge sought harsh sentences for those accused. These
 findings and sentences are preliminary and remain to be
 confirmed by a military tribunal.
 The Vicariate reported 235 individual arrests and 450 group
 arrests during demonstrations in Santiago through December 31;
 there were 119 individual and 371 collective arrests in the
 rest of the country through August 31. The Vicariate reported
 833 individual and 2,983 collective arrests in 1988, and 699
 individual and 2,596 collective arrests in 1987. The CHRC
 reported 203 individual arrests and 1,241 collective arrests
 as of June 30, 1989. Only a small number of those arrested
 were arraigned before the courts; the vast majority were
 released without charges, or charged with minor violations and
 fined.
 Many of those detained under Article 19 of the Constitution
 are never charged and are released after several days. The
 state security laws often appear to be used to harass
 opponents of the Government but to a lesser degree than in
 previous years. Persons are detained for prolonged periods of
 time while their cases are investigated or released on bail
 without any formal charge against which they can defend
 themselves. Four persons associated with the Vicariate are in
 this position. Moreover, charges are often levied well after
 the event, heightening the impression of arbitrariness and
 harassment. For example, five leftist political leaders were
 charged in May for offenses against the armed forces because
 of statements made in August 1986 in a private letter to the
 then Vice Commander of the Army. Because of charges pending
 against them, several political figures were denied the
 opportunity to run for Congress.
 Once formally charged with, or convicted of, violations of
 state security laws, the accused are generally imprisoned
 separately from common criminals and have rights of visitation
 and communication with their families, friends, legal counsel,
 and representatives of the ICRC. The ICRC has access to most
 of those detained under the state security laws after a 5-day
 period of incommunicado detention.
 On August 17, 1988, the Supreme Court sentenced President
 Manuel Bustos and Vice President Arturo Martinez of the
 Unified Workers' Central (CUT) to 541 days' internal exile.
 The action stemmed from a petition by the Ministry of the
 Interior to overturn an appeals court verdict exonerating the
 two from charges relating to the deaths of persons in the wake
 of an October 1987 general strike. Despite pleas from Chilean
 political leaders, international labor organizations, and
 others, the Chilean Government held off on granting a pardon
 until October 23, 1989, when one was issued apparently to
 forestall an expected visit to Chile on their behalf by Polish
 Solidarity leader Lech Walesa.
 
 
 502
 With regard to forced or compulsory labor, see Section 6.c.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 First instance jurisdiction for the prosecution of proscribed
 political activities remains with the regular civilian courts,
 but broad interpretation of state security laws has greatly
 expanded military court jurisdiction. As in most civil law
 systems, trial is not by jury, reliance is on the written
 record rather than oral testimony, and the judge renders a
 verdict after directing the investigation. The investigation
 phase is considered secret, with limited access for the
 accused or his attorney to evidence or testimony which has
 been developed by the judge. Secrecy makes it extremely
 difficult to ascertain if justice is being done. There is a
 well-developed, multistage appeal process leading ultimately
 to the Supreme Court. Weapons violations (often the basis of
 charges against suspected terrorists) and charges of "Offenses
 Against the Armed Forces," including slandering the
 Commander-in-Chief of the Army (President Pinochet), are tried
 before a military court. Appeals may be made to a military
 court consisting of two civilian judges and three military
 judges and, in the last resort, to the Supreme Court. In
 March the President of the Supreme Court criticized the number
 of cases handled in the military.judicial system.and
 questioned the impartiality of decisions in a system
 characterized by a military hierarchy.
 Investigation by the courts of present and past human rights
 violations made little progress during 1989. Human rights
 organizations continued to charge that judges failed to
 investigate vigorously charges of government abuses of human
 rights.
 The Social Aid Foundation of the Christian Churches (FASIC)
 reported that, as of September 30, there were 439 persons in
 prison facing 613 judicial proceedings related to state
 security laws. Thirty-seven of these people have been in
 prison since before 1983, but 138 were detained in 1986 and
 1987. Sixty-three were detained in the first 9 months of
 1989. Of the 613 judicial proceedings, 476 are before
 military courts. Another 26 persons were released on bail
 during 1989, 2 were released after completing their prison
 terms, 1 was released unconditionally without a trial and 4
 were pardoned. Of a total prison population of 439 involved
 in violations of state security laws, 85 have been convicted
 and are serving their sentences, while 354 remain in detention
 with their cases still under investigation. In at least one
 case, the investigation phase has lasted 8 years. Of four
 persons charged in the 1984 murder of 2 Carabineros, one,
 Dogoberto Lopez, was found innocent on February 8; the
 investigating judge found the other 3 guilty. The sentences
 still must be confirmed by a military tribunal.
 International attention continued to focus during 1989 on nine
 prisoners who face possible death sentences because of charges
 of involvement in assassinations of senior military officers
 and Carabineros and robberies in which people were killed.
 Defense lawyers have charged that all were tortured and their
 confessions obtained under physical and psychological duress.
 Human rights organizations have assisted III prisoners,
 including the 9 facing a possible death sentence, to obtain
 visas to other countries. This was done in the belief that
 possession of such visas might either allow these prisoners to
 seek remission of their prison terms for exile or protect them
 
 
 503
 from the death sentence. While the Government permitted many
 Chileans serving prison sentences related to politically
 motivated acts to seek exile in the mid-1970's, this practice
 has been severely restricted in recent years. One reason
 given has been that some of those who sought exile later
 returned to Chile illegally and became involved in terrorist
 activities. The death penalty can only be imposed by
 unanimous decision of a military court. No one has been
 executed by judicial order in Chile for a politically
 motivated crime under the Pinochet Government.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Searches of the home and interception of private
 communications are permitted by the Constitution, provided
 search warrants are issued by either a civilian or military
 court for specific locations. The 1984 Antiterrorist Law
 provides for surveillance of those promoting political views
 contrary to the Constitution or those suspected of terrorist
 crimes, and for intercepting, opening, or recording private
 communications and documents in these cases. The requirement
 for proper court documents to authorize searches and
 surveillance, however, was not always complied with during the
 year. Searches were carried out by security forces or by
 armed groups who failed or refused to show identification or
 without the necessary court orders. However, the Vicariate
 noted that during 1989, as in 1988, there were no reported
 instances of security'forces closing off entire neighborhoods
 in order to conduct searches and'that, in general, detentions
 were more directly connected to specific cases and less
 sweeping than in the past.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution recognizes freedom of speech and press.
 Restrictions on those freedoms have been greatly reduced in
 law and have largely disappeared in practice. Among the
 constitutional amendments approved in the July 30 plebiscite
 was the elimination of Article 8, which had provided for
 sanctions against "persons or groups propagating doctrines
 undermining the family, espousing violence or a concept of the
 society, the state, or legal order.. .contrary to the
 institutional order of the country." This Article had been
 applied to media coverage, commentary, or publicity about such
 groups or doctrines, and its elimination was welcomed as a
 victory for freedom of speech and press. However, the
 Military Code providing for sanctions against persons charged
 with "Offenses Against the Armed Forces" remains in force. In
 past years, critical editorials, satirical reports, and
 articles on issues deemed sensitive by the Armed Forces have
 been cited under this provision. According to the Chilean
 National Association of Journalists, there were more than 30
 charges pending in military courts against 19 of its members
 in 1989. Most of these cases date from 1985 to 1988. In 1989
 only two cases against journalists-or media organizations were
 initiated in the military courts. Additionally, the Interior
 Ministry requested that a judge investigate possible charges
 against the editor of a new leftwing magazine, Punto Final for
 "Offenses Against the President."  In another instance, a
 judge declined to prosecute in a case brought before the civil
 court by the Government. Military courts also are prosecuting
 at. least five nonjournalists for "Offenses Against the Armed
 
 
 504
 Forces" made in interviews or because of their position as
 director or owner of an offending medium. Most of these cases
 were initiated 2 or 3 years ago. Several journalists have
 received suspended sentences. A lawyer with the Vicariate,
 indicted for an article he wrote for the Jesuit monthly
 magazine Mensaje in 1987, was found not guilty in 1989 by a
 military judge; however, there is a petition before the
 Supreme Court to have the decision overturned.
 Generally, however, informal censorship was no longer in
 evidence, and self-censorship was no longer as pervasive as in
 the past. Several books dealing with human rights abuses
 under the Pinochet administration were published in 1989.
 Media access for political and other leaders critical of the
 Governmient was greatly expanded in 1989, and various opinions
 on such formerly sensitive issues as human rights violations,
 the civilian/military relationship, and controversial actions
 of the Government were widely covered in both print and
 electronic media. The media extensively covered and commented
 on the political campaigns and the process of the return to
 democracy. Candidates for the December 14 elections received
 generally equitable television exposure, and political
 persohalities representing a wide spectrum were regularly seen
 on weekly televised political forums. A debate between the
 two leading presidential candidates, the first of its kind in
 Chilean history, was aired on October 9. However, the press
 chief of the government-owned national television was forced
 to resign after the August 29 telecast of an interview,
 notable for its objectivity and fair treatment, of the
 candidate for the center-left coalition.
 In October the Government promulgated a law to privatize
 television channels. A seven-member National Television
 Council (NTC), appointed for a 6-year term, is authorized to
 grant and take away licenses and sanction channels. Critics
 of the measure cited it as an attempt by the Pinochet
 Government to extend its control over television programming
 through the 4-year presidential term which begins in March
 1990 and to insure that only individuals or entities
 sympathetic to the Pinochet Government receive licenses. An
 army lieutenant colonel and a navy captain are among those
 appointed to the NTC, and it includes no opposition
 representative. The Television Law can be modified by an
 absolute majority vote in the new Congress which takes office
 in March 1990.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 There were few restrictions on peaceful demonstrations and
 association in 1989. Although official permission to hold
 rallies is no longer technically required, authorities must be
 notified in writing of planned public events. Several large
 demonstrations were held during 1989, including May Day labor
 demonstrations and political rallies. Carabinero
 crowd-control methods were generally nonconfrontational,
 although there were occasional clashes when tear gas and water
 cannon were used, and which resulted in arrests.
 For a discussion of freedom of association as it applies to
 labor unions, see Section 6.a.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 The Constitution provides for freedom of religion. Although
 Chile is predominantly Roman Catholic, there are no
 
 
 505
 restrictions on religious practices and no official
 discrimination against any religious group. A number of
 Protestant denominations and other groups are active and
 report full freedom and tolerance, as does the local Jewish
 community. Religious belief and adherence appear to have no
 effect on acceptability for government positions. The Mormon
 Church continued to be a target of leftwing terrorist groups,
 primarily the MJL; Mormon churches were bombed, but there were
 no reported injuries.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Chileans are promised full constitutional freedom to move
 within and to enter and leave their country. However, as
 noted in Section l.d., two Chilean labor leaders remained in
 internal exile until they were pardoned in October. Many
 exiles presumably choose to remain in their adopted countries
 for economic and family reasons.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 The transition from a military junta, which has held power for
 16 years, to a democratically elected civilian Government is
 proceeding in keeping with the terms of the 1980
 Constitution. Presidential and congressional elections were
 held December 14. Over 95 percent of registered voters cast
 ballots in the fair and orderly elections. The new Government
 will assume power on March 11, 1990. There is universal
 suffrage for citizens 18 years of age or over, and over 95
 percent of those eligible are registered to vote.
 Discussions among government officials and political leaders
 led to an agreement in April on changes to the 1980
 Constitution, for purposes of "perfecting" it (in the view of
 the officials) and to make it more democratic (in the view of
 the political leaders). The package of reforms was then
 submitted to a plebiscite on July 30. Approximately 92
 percent of registered voters participated in the peaceful
 plebiscite, and 85 percent approved the package of reforms.
 Although critics of the 1980 Constitution contend the reforms
 were not sufficiently far-reaching, the reforms included
 provisions to make amendment of the Constitution less
 burdensome; increased the number of elected Senators, thus
 diluting the power of appointed Senators; diminished the role
 of the National Security Council and equalized the number of
 civilians and military officers within it (it had previously
 been weighted in favor of the military); and shortened the
 next presidential term of office to 4 years.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 In April the UNHRC Special Rapporteur resigned for health
 reasons, and the Chilean Government announced it would not
 accept a replacement. Subsequently, the Special Rapporteur
 rescinded his resignation yet was refused entry by the Chilean
 Government. Nonetheless, the Special Rapporteur plans to
 submit a report.
 The Government continued its cooperation with the ICRC, which
 provided confidential reports to key government ministries on
 the results of its visits to prisons, as provided for in the
 
 
 506
 CHILE
 agreements signed late in 1986 and early in 1987 with the CNI,
 the Investigations Police, and the Carabineros. The
 Government permits visits and investigations by private
 international human rights groups.* The Government accorded
 them no official status but made no effort to impede the
 journalists and other international observers of the July
 plebiscite and the December elections.
 The Catholic Church continues to take the lead in defending
 human rights. It supplies legal counsel to those,accused of
 politically related crimes and to victims of human rights
 abuses. Its Vicariate of Solidarity monitors the human rights
 situation throughout Chile, issues factual monthly reports,
 and protects and defends significant numbers of people. The
 statistics provided by the Vicariate generally cover cases
 actually handled by it. An attempt by the Government to
 secure certain files of the Vicariate was eventually suspended
 when the Vicariate refused to surrender the documents. The
 CHRC, a private organization, also continued to publicize
 abuses. Statistics provided by the CHRC cover violations
 brought to its attention throughout the country. Because some
 persons involved in human rights violations may not go to the
 Vicariate for assistance, the CHRC statistics provide a wider
 but less first-hand picture of human rights violations.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Minority groups do not suffer from any specific legal
 discrimination. The only significant racial minority, the
 Mapuche Indians in southern Chile, remains separated from the
 rest of society because of historical, cultural, educational,
 and geographical factors rather than official policy.
 Legal distinctions between the sexes still exist, despite a
 law passed, in 1989 to reduce restrictions on women. For
 example, wives can now retain control over income earned
 independently from their spouses, although assets held at the
 time of marriage become community property controlled by the
 husband; decisions on where to live are to be jointly taken,
 whereas before a woman was obliged to live where her husband
 decided. The legal retirement age for women is 5 years lower
 than that for men. Inheritance laws provide strong protection
 for wives and favor female over male heirs.
 There are no readily available figures on the magnitude of the
 problem of violence against women, including domestic
 violence, such as wife beating. Major media outlets rarely
 cover the issue, and the most prominent human rights groups,
 including women's organizations, concentrate their attention
 and resources on other human rights issues. Under the changes
 in the law which were enacted in 1989, a husband no longer has
 legal control over a wife's person as well as her goods. This
 change, at least in theory, should make it easier for women to
 bring charges of physical abuse against their husbands.
 The U.N. Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial
 Discrimination was signed by Chile in 1980 and ratified on
 October 17, 1989. It entered into force on December 29 when
 the text of the Convention was published in the official
 gazette.

 CHILE
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Workers in Chile have the right to form and join unions.
 Approximately 10 percent of the work force is organized. Most
 aspects of labor rights are codified in 12 laws passed in
 1987. The political parties law was amended to permit union
 (and professional association) leaders to be political party
 activists, but the prohibition against their simultaneously
 holding both party and union or association office was
 maintained.
 Legally recognized unions do not need permission to hold union
 meetings or conferences. Under the law, unions cannot elect
 as an officer a person who is under indictment. The Labor
 Code also discourages the development of national union
 confederations, but labor unions can and do maintain relations
 with international labor bodies in their fields. The
 Government selects Chilean worker delegates to participate in
 the conference of the International Labor Organization (ILO).
 In 1989, as in prior years, the Government sought to avoid
 challenges to the credentials of these delegates by consulting
 with representative trade unions in Chile. However, in
 selecting delegates to represent the Chilean workers in the
 ILO, the Government ignored the major de facto umbrella labor
 organizations, such as the Unified Workers Central (CUT),
 which the Government does not recognize.
 Under the Labor Code there are severe restrictions on the
 right to strike. Strikes are prohibited in 25 designated
 strategic enterprises, primarily public utilities, the largest
 government copper mine, and the petroleum industry. There is
 no indication that blacklisting of trade union leaders and
 members who participated in illegal strike actions in past
 years has ended; however, there was no instance of massive
 dismissal of workers for striking during 1989. Legal strikes
 which did take place tended to be brief; there were only three
 strikes in 1989 which lasted 60 days or longer. After 60
 days, striking workers are subject to loss of benefits and
 jobs.
 On January 26, 1988, President Manuel Bustos and Vice
 President Arturo Martinez of the National Workers Command CNT
 (which was subsequently subsumed into the CUT) were sentenced
 to 541 days imprisonment for calling a general and illegal
 strike on October 7, 1987, in the aftermath of which several
 people died. An appeals court overturned the conviction.
 Subsequently, the Minister of the Interior appealed to the
 Supreme Court to restore the original sentence; on August 17,
 1988, the high court imposed a sentence of 541 days of
 internal exile, a sentence rarely handed down by Chilean
 courts. Despite widespread national and international appeals
 for a pardon, the Government had refused to grant one until
 October 23, 1989, after the two had served 403 days of the
 sentence. In April 1989, four other CUT officials were
 charged with the same offense as Bustos and Martinez, calling
 an illegal strike (to demand, among other things, the release
 of Bustos and Martinez) which prompted some violence. They
 had not yet been brought to trial at year's end.
 In January the Ministry of Economy ordered the Association
 of Teachers' President and Vice President to leave office
 because they had failed to submit, as required by law, a
 Carabinero certificate stating they had no charges pending
 
 
 508
 against them; both have charges outstanding in connection with
 their involvement in an allegedly illegal demonstration
 several years ago. The Ministry of Economy rescinded the
 order at the end of January, however, and fined them instead.
 By year's end the Government had not yet responded to
 petitions from two labor unionists for restoration of their
 citizenship, which they lost when exiled; several exiled
 political figures did have their citizenship restored.
 Chile has not ratified ILO Conventions 87 on Freedom of
 Association or 98 on Collective Bargaining.
 The cases listed above are among numerous complaints filed
 against Chile with the ILO by a number of national and
 international trade union organizations over the past several
 years. In its most recent interim report (June 1989) on the
 status of these cases, the ILO Committee on Freedom of
 Association (CFA) noted that the Government had provided
 detailed information on most of the allegations, and made
 recommendations for the resolution of outstanding charges.
 In its review of the application of conventions in 1989, the
 ILO Committee of Experts (COE) reiterated its call for Chile's
 repeal of- provisions of the Constitution and various laws
 which bar individuals from holding public jobs or offices, or
 positions in publishing or education by virtue of their
 membership in or association with organizations which espouse
 certain prohibited ideologies or political viewpoints. The
 COE also cited laws which provide for discharge without
 compensation for activities unrelated to the work place, as
 incompatible with ILO standards. The Committee also called on
 the Government to repeal laws which grant broad discretionary
 power to executives of educational institutions and permit the
 barring of students and teachers from such institutions for
 the expressing ofpolitical Opinions.
 Organized labor continued to press during the year for a full
 investigation of-the 1982 murder of labor leader Tucapel
 Jimenez. Effotts'to pursue the investigation continue, but
 the case remains officially closed. While the Supreme Court
 dismissed indictments against a political leader and a trade
 union officer for having slandered the Government in this
 case, there remained high interest within Chilean and
 international trade union circles in seeing this case reopened.
 On December 24, 1987, after failing to make promised changes
 in its Labor Code to enhance workers' rights, Chile was
 formally suspended from the list of countries eligible to
 participate in the U.S. Generalized System'of Preferences
 (GSP) Program, and it remained suspended throughout 1989.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 While the rules governing union organizing in firms employing
 between 25 and 50 workers were eased in 1988, collective
 bargaining.is strictly regulated, and the entire collective
 bargaining procedure can be nullified if any of a series of
 legally imposed deadlines are missed by either the union or
 management. Further, a union does not have the option of
 delaying the bargaining process in anticipation of a more
 propitious future bargaining atmosphere. A decision not to
 negotiate a new contract upon-expiration of the former one
 results in automatically extending the expired contract for a
 minimum 2-year period. Although Chilean law protects the
 right for workers to form unions, in practice such laws are
 not effective, especially in small workplaces.

 right for workers to form unions, in practice such laws are
 not effective, especially in small workplaces.
 Despite the restrictions in the Labor Code, there were 1,402
 collective bargaining agreements signed in 1988, the latest
 year for which data are available.
 There are no export processing zones or other special
 districts where different laws apply.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Forced or compulsory labor is implicitly prohibited in the
 Constitution and Labor Code, and there have been no complaints
 on this issue since the mid-1970's.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 Child labor is regulated by law. Young persons aged 14 and 15
 may be employed with the permission of their parents or
 guardians, if they have completed their schooling and then
 only in restricted types of labor. Those between the ages of
 15 and 18 can be employed in a larger variety of labor, and at
 expanded hours, but only with their parents* or guardians'
 permission. Enforcement of these regulations in the formal
 sector is good, but economic factors have forced many children
 to seek part-time and full-time employment in the informal
 economy which is generally difficult to regulate.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 Minimum wages, hours of work, and occupational safety and
 health standards are regulated by law. The normal workweek is
 48 hours. The minimum wage is approximately $70 per month; it
 is not considered sufficient for a decent standard of living,
 but many households have two full-time wage earners.
 The law permits the hiring of apprentices, but pay may not be
 less than the minimum wage. Laws covering wages and hours of
 work are difficult to enforce, and there are complaints that
 occupational health and safety laws are not adequately
 policed. Workers have the right to denounce employers who pay
 less than the minimum wage, and employers can be forced to pay
 back wages, but an employee who brings such a complaint risks
 losing his job for having done so.
