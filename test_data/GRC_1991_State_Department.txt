 GREECE
 Greece is a constitutional republic and parliamentary democracy.
 The Government under Prime Minister Constantine Mitsotakis,
 formed after free elections in April 1990, holds a two-seat
 majority in the Parliament. President Constantine Karamanlis,
 the largely ceremonial Head of State, was chosen by Parliament
 in April 1990.
 The police and security services are subject to a broad variety
 of legal and constitutional restraints. Their activities are
 monitored by the Parliament, a vigorous free press, the
 judiciary, and human rights groups.
 The Greek economy has a very large state sector with a strong
 tradition of patronage. Among the least developed countries in
 the European Community (EC), Greece relies heavily on EC
 subsidies and loans. Efforts by the Government to reduce the
 budget deficit and strengthen the private sector are hampered
 by, among other things, political polarization and opposition
 from labor unions and other groups.
 The Constitution protects fundamental human rights which in
 large part are respected in practice. Some Muslim Greeks have
 complained that they face discriminatory governmental practices.
 These complaints led the Government in 1991 to pledge corrective
 action, a process which is ongoing. Complaints of religious
 discrimination also occurred in 1991, including arrests of
 Jehovah's Witnesses for proselytizing. About 400 Jehovah's
 Witnesses were-imprisoned because nonmilitary alternative
 service to conscription is not available in Greece.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section I Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 Neither government forces nor legal opposition groups engage in
 political killing. However, an alleged drug dealer was beaten
 to death while in police custody (see Section l.c.).
 Domestic terrorist organizations claimed responsibility for the
 bombing murder of an American serviceman in March, the fatal
 shooting of a Turkish diplomat in October, and attempted bombing
 murders of several Turkish diplomats and Athens policemen. In
 April, while trying to disarm a bomb which it had intended to
 place at the British Consulate in Patras, an Arab group caused
 a blast which killed one of the group and six other persons.
 Police arrested several suspects, but a trial date has not been
 announced.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reports of official disappearance.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 A 1984 law makes the use of torture an offense punishable by a
 sentence of from 3 years to life imprisonment. This law has
 never been invoked, and there were no allegations of police
 torture in 1991. However, the press reported in January that
 an alleged drug dealer was fatally beaten while in police
 
 
 1123
 GREECE
 custody. Three police officers were charged, and a magistrate's
 investigation is continuing.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detentibn, or Exile
 The Constitution requires judicial warrants for all arrests
 except during the actual commission of a crime. The legal
 system generally protects against arbitrary arrest orders.
 Suspects are sometimes detained, briefly and informally, pending
 confirmation of their identity, but there is no evidence of a
 pattern of serious infringements of civil liberties. A person
 arrested on the basis of a warrant or while committing a crime
 must be brought before an examining magistrate within 24 hours-
 The magistrate must issue a detention warrant or order the
 release of the detainee within 3 days, unless special
 circumstances require a 2-day extension of this time limit.
 The effective maximum duration of pretrial detention is 18
 months for felonies and 9 months for misdemeanors. Release
 pending trial, with or without bail, may in some cases be
 granted by decision of a panel of judges.
 Exile is unconstitutional and does not occur.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The judicial system is characterized by three levels of courts,
 appointed judges, an examining magistrate system, trial by
 judicial panel, and the right of appeal by both prosecution and
 defense. The independence of the judiciary is provided for in
 the Constitution. The press and opposition political parties,
 however, occasionally accuse judges of allowing political
 criteria to influence their judgments. The defense has the
 right to cross-examine witnesses. The Constitution provides
 for public trials, and court sessions are open to the'public,
 unless the court decides that privacy is required for the
 protection of victims or in matters of national security. The
 latter provision is not abused. A defendant enjoys the
 presumption of innocence and the right to counsel, and lawyers
 are provided to defendants who need them.
 The decisions of military courts are not subject to review by
 the Supreme Court. Military courts have no jurisdiction over
 civilians except in draft refusal cases.
 There are no political prisoners in Greece. There are-, however,
 a number of persons in jail for refusing military service on
 religious grounds (see Section 2.c.).
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Greek authorities comply with constitutional prohibitions
 against invasions of privacy, searches without warrants, and
 the monitoring of personal communications. Judicial warrants
 showing probable cause are required for home searches, and
 there are limits on conducting such searches at night. At
 year's end, a former Prime Minister and his onetime national
 intelligence service director continued to await a trial date
 for a 1989 parliamentary indictment for illicit wiretapping. A
 1991 decision by the European Parliament gave the former
 intelligence director, who is now a member of the European
 Parliament, immunity from trial until the end of his term in
 1994.

 GREECE
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Freedom of speech and the press are provided for in the
 Constitution and generally respected in practice. Greek
 publications, representing a gamut of political and ideological
 inclinations, are published and sold freely, and many foreign
 publications are readily available on newsstands in major
 cities. The Constitution allows for the seizure of
 publications which insult the President, offend religious
 beliefs, contain obscene articles, advocate the violent
 overthrow of the political system, or disclose military and
 defense information.
 Charges are occasionally filed against newspapers for articles
 which "insult authority." In November editors of the newspaper
 Kathimerini were sentenced to a fine or 6 months in prison for
 insulting the Prime Minister. The case is on appeal. A law
 designed to counter terrorism, which took effect in January,
 includes a section allowing the Supreme Court prosecutor to
 prohibit publication of statements by terrorist groups. In
 September, seven Athens newspaper editors became the first
 persons convicted of violating this law. Initially sentenced
 to jail, they were freed after paying fines totaling about
 $16,000. The Government has expressed willingness to discuss
 the issue with journalists' professional associations. By
 year's end, no such discussion had taken place.
 Commercial television was legalized in 1989, and private
 channels air a wide range of political viewpoints. State-owned
 channels tend to emphasize the views of the Government but
 allot time as well to the activities of opposition figures.
 Academic freedoms are protected by democratically chosen
 faculty organizations, though such groups tend to be
 politicized.
 In areas of western Thrace, Turkish-language satellite
 television broadcasts became available in 1991. Turkish-
 language publications are published and circulate locally.
 Newspapers and other periodicals from Turkey are distributed
 privately when brought in by taxis and travelers.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Constitution provides for freedom of assembly. Police
 permits are routinely issued for public demonstrations, and
 there were no reports that the permit requirement was abused.
 The right of association is provided for by the Constitution
 and is generally respected. In 1991, however, a "Macedonian
 Cultural Center" in Florina, organized by some Greek citizens
 of Slavic descent, lost an appeal of a lower court decision
 denying it registration because of the use in its title of the
 word "Macedonian," which the court held would cause confusion.
 The decision has been appealed to the Supreme Court. Official
 government policy, supported by most Greeks, denies that Greeks
 of Slavic descent constitute a distinct minority.
 Greek authorities, while recognizing a Muslim minority, do not
 recognize a separate ethnic Turkish minority (see Section 5).
 Organizations may not include the word "Tourkos" ("Turk") in
 their title. Such groups may, however, identify themselves as
 "Tourkoyennis", i.e., of Turkish deicent, affiliation, or
 ethnicity (also see Section 5). In April, two groups using the
 
 
 1125
 
 GREECE -
 word "Tourkos" in their names were ordered by government
 authorities to disband, in conformity with a 1987 court
 decision. As of December, the groups reportedly had not yet
 disbanded.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 The Constitution provides for freedom of religion and prohibits
 discrimination against religious minorities. However, the
 Constitution also establishes the Greek Orthodox Church, to
 which 98 percent of the population at least nominally adheres,
 as the "prevailing" religion, and prohibits proselytizing by
 apy religious group. In 1991, according to the Jehovah's
 Witnesses, IQ6 members of their faith were arrested for
 prosel'tizing, 18 were taken to trial on this charge, and I was
 convicted. These convictions usually result in jail sentences
 of 3 to 5 months, which can be satisfied by paying a fine.
 Although Greece provides for alternative noncombatant military
 service, it has no provision for nonmilitary alternative
 national service to its universal conscription of men. As of
 October, approximately 400 Jehovah's Witnesses were serving
 prison sentences of between 3 and 5 years for draft refusal.
 (At least two secular draft refusers were also reportedly
 imprisoned.) - A part of these sentences may be served on a
 minimum security civilian prison farm, where each day served is
 credited as 2 days against one's sentence. In 1991 the
 Jehovah's Witnesses organization reported that conditions for
 their members in the military prison at Avlona had improved
 significantly and that transfers to the prison farm, previously
 blocked, had resumed.
 In past years, the Government has not granted Jehovah's
 Witnesses ministers the exemption from military service
 accorded clergy of other faiths. In 1990 and 1991, however,
 the Greek Council of State set what appears to be an important
 precedent by ordering the release of three Jehovah's Witnesses
 clerics who had been imprisoned for refusing military service.
 There are currently no Jehovah's Witnesses clergy so imprisoned.
 All churches require the permission of the local Greek Orthodox
 bishop to open and operate. Such permission is sometimes
 delayed or withheld, though religious services are often
 conducted while awaiting formal permission. In 1991 Jehovah's
 Witnesses were arrested for allegedly operating an unlicensed
 house of worship, and the building was sealed. The case is
 being appealed.
 Mosques and other Muslim religious institutions operate in
 western Thrace, where most Greek citizens of the Muslim faith
 reside. In March the Greek and Turkish Governments traded
 charges over Greece's denial of entry to a group of Turkish
 preachers who wished to help the Muslim community in Thrace
 observe Ramadan. The Turkish Government claimed that the
 preachers .were barred because they refused to call on an-
 appointed mufti (see below), while the Greek Government
 insisted that the Thracian, Muslim community had adequate
 clerical resources and that the Turkish clerics' application
 had unacceptable nationalistic .overtones. In contrast with
 previous years, there were no complaints in 1991 that Greek
 authorities had withheld permission for construction and repair
 of mosques. Some members of the Muslim minority claim that
 Greek Law 1091 of 1990 (promulgated in January 1991) weakens
 the financial autonomy of the wakfs, Muslim religious
 endowments.
 
 
 1126
 GREECE
 In 1991 the Greek Government appointed a new mufti (Muslim
 community religious leader) in Xanthi, a district capital in
 western Thrace. In doing so, the Government was acting under a
 1990 Presidential decree which abolished a never-implemented
 1920 law providing for direct election of muftis. The 1990
 decree did, however, incorporate formal consultation with local
 Muslim leaders into existing practice. Opponents of the
 appointment, who favor having muftis elected by their
 communities, demonstrated and clashed briefly with non-Muslims
 in Xanthi. In September and October, a number of mosques in
 the Xanthi district were closed by their imams in protest over
 the appointment of the new mufti. Greek government policy is
 that muftis must be appointed, as they are also judicial
 functionaries paid by the Greek State, with authority in many
 civil and domestic matters.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 The Constitution protects freedom of movement within the
 country, foreign travel, and emigration. Ethnic Greeks
 intending to emigrate, and emigrants who return to Greece,
 experience no discrimination. However, Article 19 of the Greek
 citizenship code distinguishes between Greek citizens who are
 ethnic Greeks and those who are not. The latter may be deprived
 of citizenship if it is determined that they have left Greece
 with the apparent intent not to return. Most such cases involve
 Muslims from western Thrace. Proceedings under Article 19 are
 initiated on the basis of reports by local authorities in Greece
 or by Greek embassies or consulates abroad. A hearing is held
 by the Interior Ministry, at which the affected person is not
 present, nor is the affected person notified of the hearing.
 Those who lose Greek citizenship as a result of such hearings
 sometimes learn of this loss only when they seek to reenter
 Greece. In December 1991, the Foreign Ministry said that, in
 the preceding year, 628 persons had lost citizenship under
 Article 19.
 Persons who lose their Greek citizenship under Article 19 have
 the right of "administrative appeal" to the Interior Ministry
 and may also appeal to the Greek Council of State and to the
 Council of Europe. Leaders of the Turkish-origin Greek
 community complain that the time and expense involved tend to
 discourage such appeals. According to the Foreign Ministry,
 there were 39 "administrative appeals" during 1991, of which 2
 were successful, 21 unsuccessful, and 16 still pending as of
 December. There was also an average of two or three appeals
 per month to the Council of State, most of which were
 successful. There were no appeals to the Council of Europe.
 The Government has provided high-level assurances that Article
 19 will be abolished in 1992.
 Increasingly a destination for economic migrants, Greece offers
 temporary asylum to a large number of refugees from Eastern
 Europe, Africa, and the Middle East, as well as, since 1986,
 about 32,000 ethnic Greeks from the U.S.S.R., known as
 Pontians. Pontians who migrate to Greece are recognized as
 Greek citizens and accorded full rights.
 Permanent resettlement in Greece is not usually available for
 non-ethnic Greek refugees. There was a major refugee flow of
 Albanians into Greece in 1991. Very few Albanians entering
 Greece, according to the figures of the United Nations High
 Commissioner for Refugees, were granted asylum status, though
 
 
 1127
 
 GREECE
 much larger numbers were informally permitted to remain and
 work, often at subsistence wages.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Greece is a multiparty democracy in which all citizens enjoy
 full political rights. The President is elected by Parliament
 to a 5-year term. Members of the unicameral 300-seat
 Parliament are elected to 4-year terms by secret ballot, and
 universal suffrage for those over 18 is compulsory (i.e.,
 enforced by fines and administrative penalties). Opposition
 parties function freely and have broad access to the media.
 Under a 1990 electoral law, no candidate may be elected whose
 party does not receive 3 percent or more of the nationwide
 vote. Current independent members of Parliament (two of whom
 are of Turkish origin) will be unlikely to be reelected unless
 they run as candidates of one of the national parties. There
 are no restrictions, in law or in practice, on the
 participation of women in government or politics.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitudes Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigations of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Domestic human rights organizations are allowed to operate
 freely and to assist Greeks who believe their rights have been
 violated. The Government has not obstructed visits and
 investigations by human rights organizations.
 Prime Minister Mitsotakis suggested to the Council of Europe
 (COE) in April that Greece would welcome COE observers who
 wished to see for themselves the minority situation in western
 Thrace. -
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Under the Treaty of Lausanne (1923), Greece formally recognizes
 a "Muslim minority" in western Thrace. Greece has also
 accepted later Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe
 (CSCE) documents which address the treatment of minorities.
 The Government estimates the Muslim minority in Thrace at
 roughly 120,000 persons, consisting of people of Turkish
 origin, Pomaks (speaking a language akin to Bulgarian), and
 Gypsies. Some Muslims live on Greek islands near the Turkish
 coast, in Athens, and other industrial areas. Various areas,
 mostly in northern Greece, are home to Greek citizens speaking
 or descended from speakers of Arvanite (an Albanian dialect),-
 Vlach (a Romance language), and one or more Slavic dialects.
 In addition to speaking Greek, many of these people possess
 some level of fluency in one of these dialects, although
 younger individuals tend increasingly to be monolingual in
 Greek. Gypsies (both Christian and Muslim) are scattered
 throughout Greece.
 The Government in 1991 showed increasing sensitivity to
 criticism of official policy toward the Muslim minority in
 Thrace. In a visit to Thrace in May, the Prime Minister
 conceded past errors in the treatment of Muslim citizens and
 pledged the latter's full equality before the law. Though
 problems of discrimination remain, the situation in Thrace has
 begun to improve.
 
 
 1128
 GREECE
 In 1991 official harassment of Muslim Greeks in Thrace,
 including impediments greater than those encountered by
 non-Muslims in buying land and obtaining hunting, drivers', and
 tractor licenses and building construction and maintenance
 permits, by most accounts eased significantly. The current
 concern of Muslims is to legalize the status of buildings built
 without permits in past years. One complaint was received that
 several Muslims' houses were demolished by local authorities
 for having been constructed without permits. Greek officials
 noted that several non-Muslims' houses had been razed for the
 same reason at the same time. In years past, there were
 complaints that land purchases by eminent domain for public
 construction projects affected Muslim landowners
 disproportionately. There was only one such complaint in 1991,
 and it involved a project that was subsequently canceled.
 Some Turkish-origin Greeks claim that they are hired only in
 small numbers for lower level public sector employment in
 Thrace, and rarely or not at all at higher levels. The
 Government cites the need for a university degree as a factor
 which reduces the number of Muslims qualified for high-level
 civil service employment.
 Public offices do their business in Greek; the courts provide
 interpreters as needed. In the Komotini district in Thrace,
 where many members of the Muslim minority live, the office of
 the district governor (nomarch) has interpreters available.
 The Treaty of Lausanne guarantees the Muslim minority the right
 to Turkish-language education and contains a reciprocal
 entitlement for the Greek minority in Istanbul. There are both
 Koranic and secular Turkish-language schools in western
 Thrace. Disputes with Turkey over teachers and textbooks have
 caused the secular schools serious problems in obtaining
 sufficient faculty and teaching materials in quantity and
 quality. The Greek Government plans to issue new texts for the
 lower grades in Thracian Turkish-language schools; these were
 not ready in time for the 1991-92 school year. In the summer
 of 1991, new Turkish-language high school texts were sent from
 Turkey for the first time since the late 1970's. As of
 December, Greek authorities were still examining these texts
 for suitability.
 Some Turkish-origin Greeks complain that it is difficult to
 obtain permissibn to bring in teachers from Turkey or to hire
 Turkish-language teachers locally, particularly for the two
 secular Turkish-language high schools. Under a bilateral
 agreement, Greece and Turkey may annually exchange up to 35
 teachers each to serve, respectively, in Istanbul and western
 Thrace. In September 1991, Greece did not seek to send
 teachers to Istanbul; Turkey applied to send 35 high school
 teachers to Greek Thrace and, as of December, was still
 awaiting their work permits.
 Muslim villages elect Muslim-dominated local governments. In
 Komotini and Xanthi, the principal towns of western Thrace,
 both Muslims and non-Muslims are elected as town councillors.
 The use of the word "Tourkos" ("Turk") is prohibited in titles
 of organizations, though individuals may legally call
 themselves "Tourkos". To most Greeks, the word "Tourkos"
 connotes Turkish citizenship and loyaltiesi and many object to
 its use by Greeks of Turkish origin. Use of a similar
 adjective, "Tourkoyennis" ("of Turkish descent/affiliation/
 
 
 1129
 GREECE
 ethnicity"), is allowed (see also Section 2.b.), but it is
 considered bookish and not colloquially used.
 Northern Greece is home to a small'number of Greek citizens who
 are descended from speakers of a Slavic dialect and who have
 the same rights and responsibilities as other citizens. Some
 of them still speak that dialect (along with the predominant
 Greek); and a small number of them identify themselves as
 "Macedonians." The exact number of all citizens of Slavic
 descent is difficult to determine, but unofficial estimates
 range from well under 10,000 to about 50,000. Organizations of
 these citizens are not able to use the word "Macedonian" in
 their names. In 1991 the Thessaloniki appellate court upheld a
 ban against a cultural center in Florina on those grounds (see
 Section 2.b.). That organization has appealed the court
 decision.
 There ire broad constitutional and legal protections for women,
 including equal pay for equal work. Gradually, women are
 entering the higher echelons of business and government as
 traditional barriers erode. The Government has a General
 Secretariat for Equality of the Sexes, which coordinates
 efforts to remove these barriers. Muslim women in western
 Thrace have the option of Islamic or bivil marriage and Islamic
 or civil jurisdiction in domestic disputes.
 Violence against women is a problem identified by women's
 rights groups, but there is a strong cultural bias against
 reporting cases of rape, incest, and wife beating. There are
 no reliable statistics to indicate the extent of these-
 problems. Police and local authorities generally'do not
 intervene in domestic conflicts. The social infrastructure for
 battered women is almost nonexistent, despite past funding by
 the European Community. Women's groups continue tb press the
 government for improvements; it acknowledges the need for more
 active measures...
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 All workers, except the military and police, are entitled to
 form or join unions of their own choosing. The right of
 association is provided for in the Constitution and in specific
 legislation passed in 1978 and amended in 1982. In 1991 an
 estimated 35 percent of wage and salary earners were organized
 in unions.
 Unions receive most of their funding through a Ministry of
 Labor organization, the.Workers' Hearth, which distributes
 mandatory contributions from employees and employers. Only a,
 few of the more powerful unions have dues-withholding
 provisions in their contracts with employers. Legislation
 passed in December 1990 will eliminate Workers' Hearth funding
 for labor unions effective in January 1992, and it is the
 subject of a Confederation of Greek Labor (GSEE) complaint to
 the International Labor organization (ILO).
 More than 4,000 unions are grouped into regional and sectoral
 federations and two umbrella confederations, one for civil
 servants and the other for private sector workers. The unions
 are highly politicized, with party-affiliated factions within
 the labor confederations, but they are not controlled by the
 parties or by the Government in their day-to-day operations.
 There are no restrictions on who may serve as a union official.
 
 
 1130
 GREECE
 There are no restrictions on international contacts, and Greek
 unions maintain a variety of international affiliations.
 The 1990 law qualifies the right to strike by requiring
 skeleton staffs during strikes in workplaces providing such
 public services as electricity, transportation, communications,
 and banking. In strikes that took place in November and
 December 1991, skeleton staffs, mandated by the 1990 labor law,
 did not completely ensure that essential services went
 uninterrupted. The Government did not bring charges against
 unions or individuals who may have violated the law.
 Some 250 strikes took place in 1991, including public
 transportation strikes that caused considerable disruption and
 engendered popular irritation with the labor federations.
 Although the courts may declare strikes illegal, the effective
 right to strike was legally restricted in 1991 only by the
 Government's power to declare the civil mobilization of workers
 in case of danger to national security, life, or property or to
 the social and economic life of the country. This provision,
 which was not used in 1991, is considered by the ILO to violate
 the standards of ILO Convention 87 on freedom of association
 and was the subject of criticism by the ILO Committee of
 Experts.
 Addressing union complaints that most labor disputes ended in
 compulsory arbitration, legislative remedies were enacted in
 1989 providing for mediation procedures with compulsory
 arbitration as a last resort. In 1991, the Ministry of Labor
 completed work on implementing procedures and announced that
 the law would take effect in January 1992.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 The right to organize and bargain collectively is ensured by
 legislation passed in 1955 and amended in 1990. There are no
 restrictions on collective bargaining for private'workers.
 Civil servants collectively negotiate their demands with the
 Office of the Minister to the Prime Minister but have no formal
 system of collective bargaining.
 Antiunion discrimination is prohibited. Complaints of
 discrimination against union members or organizers may be
 referred to the Labor Inspectorate or the courts, where most
 cases are resolved. Court rulings have mandated the
 reinstatement of improperly fired union organizers.
 Greece has no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Forced or compulsory labor is prohibited by the Constitution
 and is not practiced.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 The minimum age for employment in industry is 15, with higher
 limits in certain activities. In family businesses, theaters,
 and the cinema, the minimum age is 12. Enforced by occasional
 Labor Inspectorate spot checks, these age limits are generally
 respected. However, families engaged in agriculture, food
 service, or merchandising often have younger family members
 assisting, at least part-time.
 
 
 1131
 
 GREECE
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 The minimum wage is determined in collective bargaining between
 the GSEE and the employers' association. The Ministry of Labor
 routinely ratifies this minimum wage, which thereby has the
 force of law and applies to all Greek workers. The minimum
 wage is sufficient for a decent standard of living for a worker
 and his family.
 The maximum legal workweek is 40 hours in the private sector
 and 37.5 hours in the public sector. Legislation in July 1989
 allowed greater flexibility in business hours as long as, over
 a period of time, the average workweek did not exceed the legal
 maximum. The law mandates paid vacation of 1 month per year
 and sets maximum limits on overtime.
 Minimum standards of occupational health and safety are
 provided for by legislation. Although the GSEE characterizes
 health and safety legislation as satisfactory, it charges that
 enforcement, the responsibility of the Labor Inspectorate, is
 inadequate, and cites statistics indicating a relatively high
 number of job-related. accidents in Greece. Inadequate
 inspection, failure to enforce regulations, outdated industrial
 plants.and equipment, and poor safety training of employees,
 contribute to the accident rate. Inspectors are prohibited
 from divulging names of workers who lodge complaints about
 unsafe working conditions.
