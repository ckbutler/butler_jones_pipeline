 BARBADOS
 When barbacos' Constitution was proclaimed on November
 29, 1966, its drafters noted the islands traditional
 attachment to free institutions and to independence. A
 Parliament has sat in Barbados since 1639. A basic state-
 ment of the rights and privileges of Barbadians, known as
 the Charter of Barbados, was proclaimed in 1652 and has
 generally been upheld by those governing this island.
 For more than three hundred years the rights and priv-
 ileges of barbaaians have been improved and broadened
 until, in 1978, they enjoy as free and as democratic
 a system as any in the world.
 1. Respect tor the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 Torture is specifically prohibited in Sectrion 15(1) of
 the Constitution and is not practiced in Barbados.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 There have been no reports of any form of such treatment
 or punishment in recent memory. Although the Constitution
 does not prohibit use of the death penalty, the courts
 have not issued a aeath sentence in recent memory.
 c. Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 Arbitrary arrest and imprisonment are prohibited by Sec-
 tion 18(2) of the Constitution. These guarantees are
 respected in practice.
 a. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Section 18(1) of the Constitution provides that persons
 chargee with a criminal offense be given a fair, public
 (211)
 
 
 212
 d. Denial o Fair Public Trial
 Trials are tair and public, as provided tor in the
 Constitution.
 e. Invasion of the Home
 Invasion o� the home is not prohibited by law. However,
 with one exception, there have been no known cases o�
 such violations. Overzealous immigration authorities
 sometimes take illegal aliens from their homes at.
 night, to deport them. As noted above, illegal aliens
 are denied access to the courts and therefore enjoy no
 legal protection against these police methods.
 2. Governmental Policies Relating to the Fultillment
 ot Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care
 and Education
 According to World Bank statistics, The Bahamas has
 the third highest per capita annual income in
 the Western Hemisphere, $3,450. It expatriates
 resident in the Banamas are excluded from the
 calculations, the per capita income is around
 $2,000. The literacy rate is 93 percent, and lite
 expectancy is 66.8 years. Housing, health care,
 and education standards are generally adequate.
 The Government and the ruling PLP emphasize the
 need tor social programs, but expenditures in these
 areas are relatively low. There is no income tax
 and import duties provide 60 percent of public revenue.
 Most o� the rest comes from license tees and property
 taxes. The tax structure is not, therefore, progressive.
 There is no evidence o corruption serious enough to
 divert signiticant public resources from the poor.
 3. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Includ-
 ing:

 hearing within a reasonable time by an independent and
 impartial court. These guarantees are respected in
 practice.
 e. Invasion of the Home
 Section �7(1) of the Constitution prohibits arbitrary
 search or entry. This guarantee is respected in practice.
 2. Governmental Policies Relating to the Fulfillment
 of such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care
 ana Education
 The 196b proclamation of the Constitution calls for the
 Government to promote the general welfare of the citizens
 of Barbados through equitable distribution of wealth.
 both the past and present governments of Barbados have
 purused that goal effectively. For example, before the
 1976 election, the present Barbados Labour Party (BLP)
 Government comitted itself to several public welfare goals.
 These incluQed improvements in public housing and community
 centers and an overhaul of the somewhat regressive tax
 system. These goals have all been achieved.
 The bPL Government has promised to establish a Department
 of Women's Affairs and a National Commission on the Status
 of Women. These entities would make recommendations re-
 garding sex discrimination, statutory revisions necessary
 to give equal status to Barbadian women. The Government
 has oevoted over sixty percent of its operating budget and
 almost thirty percent of its capital budget to the fulfill-
 ment of vital needs. The Government also contributes to
 the airect provision of essential goods and services. It
 aoes so through involvement in statutory boards and cor-
 porations, such as the Barbados Marketing Corporation,
 which guarantees aistribution of agricultural products
 at reasonable prices, the Child Care Board, and the Public
 Assistance Board, which provides for the indigent.
 
 
 3. Respect for the Civil and Political Liberties,
 Including:
 a. Freeaom of Thought, Speech, Press, Religion
 and Assembly
 The barbados Constitution provides for all of the above
 freedoms, and these are honored in practice. The two
 regular newspapers and the cable radio services function
 inaepenaently of the Government. Government ownership
 ana operation of the Caribbean Broadcasting Corporation
 (CBC) radio and television service, which is modeled
 after the BBC, leaves the Government open to charges of
 interference in the media, but these charges are rare.
 b. Freedom of Movement within the Country, Foreign
 Travel and Emigration
 There are no impediments to free movement of citizens
 or legal residents within or without Barbados. Section
 22(1) of th Constitution guarantees the right to move
 freely throughout the country, to reside anywhere in
 Barbados, to enter and leave Barbados, and to be exempt
 from expulsion.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 There are no impediments to free participation in the
 political process in Barbados. There is no discrimination
 based on race or sex, and labor unions are free to organize
 and function.
 4. Government Attitude and Record Regarding Inter-
 national ana Non-governmental Investigation of
 Alleged Violations of human Rights
 There have been no reports of human rights violations
 in Barbaaos in recent memory and there have been no
 requests by international or non-governmentl bodies to
 investigate allegations. Barbados favors strengthening
 
 
 215
 of the huran rights machinery of the United Nations
 and the Organization of American States. The Govern-
 ment favors more investigations of alleged violations
 of human rights and the increased use of fact-finding
 or observer teams to monitor controversial political
 ana electoral situations.
