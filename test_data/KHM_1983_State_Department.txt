 KAMPUCHEA
 Vietnam controls most of Kampuchea (Cambodia) through a
 government it imposed, the People's Republic of Kampuchea,
 which it established in early 1979 under Heng Samrin, a former
 ranking member of the Khmer Rouge regime which ruled the
 country from 1975 until 1978. Most of Kampuchea is occupied by
 150,000 to 170,000 troops of the Vietnamese military forces
 which invaded the country in late 1978. The Heng Samrin regime
 is dominated by Vietnamese military and civilian officials both
 in Phnom Penh and in Hanoi.
 Vietnam has fostered the creation of a Kampuchean Communist
 Party, the Kampuchean People's Revolutionary Party, which is
 subservient to the Vietnam Workers' Party. It is the only
 political party permitted in Vietnamese-controlled areas. The
 Heng Samrin regime has sought popular support by highlighting
 the human rights violations of the previous Khmer Rouge regime
 and promising a return to traditional Khmer cultural values
 including the reestablishment of religion. The Heng Samrin
 regime has attempted to develop the institutions of government,
 including an army and bureaucracy, but both remain dependent on
 Vietnamese advisers who make major decisions.
 Serious human rights violations in Heng Samrin regime areas
 continue, and the regime enjoys little support from the Khmer
 people. The continuing Vietnamese occupation of Kampuchea,
 which denies to the Khmer people their right to
 self-determination, is the fundamental-human rights issue in
 Kampuchea today. Reports of torture, arbitrary arrest, and
 killings have increased significantly since 1982. Victims
 include even lower-level officials of the Heng Samrin regime.
 Political prisons exist in Phnom Penh and in the provinces.
 Since September 1981 the Vietnamese forces have used chemical
 and biological toxin weapons against Khmer resistance forces.
 The authority of the Heng Samrin regime is contested
 diplomatically and militarily by resistance forces concentrated
 along the Thai-Kampuchean border. The strongest of these
 resistance forces is the Khmer Rouge, which ruled Kampuchea
 from 1975 until the Vietnamese invasion at the end of 1978.
 They compiled one of the worst records of human rights
 violations in history during a thorough and brutal
 restructuring of Khmer society and individual personality.
 Since they were overthrown by the Vietnamese, the Khmer Rouge
 have claimed that they have abandoned their policy of flagrant
 violations of human rights and have tried to convince the Khmer
 people that they have democratic goals. Although the Communist
 Party of Kampuchea was formally dissolved in December 1981, its
 small, self-perpetuating leadership under Pol Pot, leng Sary,
 and Khieu Samphan continues to rule in areas under Khmer Rouge
 control.
 Non-Communist resistance groups include the Khmer People's
 National Liberation Front (KPNLF), a group led by former Prime
 Minister Son Sann and supporting Western parliamentary ideals,
 and the National United Front for an Independent, Peaceful,
 Neutral, and Cooperative Kampuchea headed by Prince Sihanouk,
 who ruled as hereditary king and later head of state until
 1970. The KPNLF was formed in 1980 when several existing
 non-Communist resistance groups merged under Son Sann's
 
 (795)
 
 
 796
 leadership. Son Sann is President, assisted by a seven-member
 executive committee broadly representative of Khmer nationalist
 sentiment. Its military field leadership is largely composed
 of personnel from the military forces of the former Khmer
 Republic, which ruled the country from 1970 to 1975. Many of
 them have been carrying out resistance activities since 1975.
 The appeal of Prince Sihanouk's organization centers on the
 Prince's stature within Kampuchea and internationally and the
 group's espousal of many Western democratic ideals. Both
 non-Communist groups apparently enjoy growing support inside
 Kampuchea.
 In 1982, the non-Communist resistance groups joined the Khmer
 Rouge in a loose coalition, known as the Coalition Government
 of Democratic Kampuchea, which is accredited to the United
 Nations. Prince Sihanouk is President and Chief of State of
 the coalition, Son Sann is Prime Minister and head of
 government, and Khieu Samphan of the Khmer Rouge is Vice
 President for Foreign Affairs. There are four joint
 ministries, called coordinating committees, on which each
 faction is represented. In 1983 the United Nations General
 Assembly again accepted the credentials of the coalition as the
 representative of Kampuchea.
 While Kampuchea's economy is predominantly agricultural, light
 industries had begun to develop by 1970. Civil war, invasion,
 and the despotism of the Khmer Rouge since then have left fewer
 than 100 small industries open today. Agriculture has
 recovered to some extent from the dislocations of the
 Vietnamese invasion, and Kampuchea can now supply most of its
 basic food requirements. From 1975 to 1978 the Khmer Rouge
 eliminated or displaced to the countryside the majority of the
 middle class, causing a critical shortage of trained personnel
 to run the Government and the economy. The Heng Samrin
 authorities are slowly attempting to impose a collective
 economic system in the country; however, most economic activity
 remains in the private sector.
 During 1983 the human rights situation in Kampuchea worsened.
 Vietnamese and Heng Samrin military and security forces
 increased repressive actions in a major internal security
 campaign to eliminate support for the resistance forces near
 areas where the resistance is active. These actions led to
 reports of brutality, summary killings, and rape by Vietnamese
 troops. There have also been reports of continued large-scale
 immigration of Vietnamese settlers into Kampuchea, posing a
 long term threat to the survival of the Khmer as a people.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section I Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a.   Unlawful or Arbitrary Deprivation of Life
 Political murder continues in Kampuchea. In the Heng Samrin
 regime, the authority to kill seems to be vested in senior
 political and military leaders. Since May 1983, there have
 been increasing reports of killings, including summary
 executions, of suspected resistance supporters by the
 Vietnamese and Hang Samrin security forces in an intensive
 internal security crackdown. The regime has also been accused
 of secretly executing prisoners. Amnesty International in 1983
 
 
 cited a report that Vietnamese forces had killed 100 villagers
 in 1982, a charge it said the Vietnamese authorities denied.
 The reported use of prohibited toxic and chemical agents by the
 Vietnamese against the resistance forces during 1983 remained
 at the same level as the previous years.
 After having been one of the most murderous regimes in modern
 times when they held power from 1975 to 1978, the Khmer Rouge
 in 1981 promulgated a law against killing that ostensibly
 imposed harsh penalties on officials involved in political
 murder. No official has been tried to date. Reports from
 Khmer Rouge-controlled areas suggest that summary executions
 continue for troops accused of having contacts with the enemy
 and, in certain areas, for desertion.
 Reports from the non-Communist guerrilla zones also cite some
 summary executions of individuals believed to be spies. These
 executions are apparently ordered by local commanders without
 reference to the political leadership of either of the
 non-Communist factions. Civilian deaths in Kampuchea most
 often result from war. Land mines are a particular danger to
 civilians and soldiers alike. Some of the mines were planted
 by the Khmer Rouge regime before 1978.
 b.   Disappearance
 There are reports from Phnom Penh that Heng Samrin security
 officials are regularly responsible for the disappearances of
 persons, most of whom are thought to be imprisoned. According
 to other reports, some refugees who return from the Thai border
 are forced by the authorities to resettle in new areas on
 government-prepared land. These people are not heard from
 again by family, friends, or neighbors.
 c.   Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Physical torture has been reported from both rural areas and
 from Phnom Penh prisons. Humiliation is said to comprise part
 of the interrogations. Recently, larger numbers of Khmer
 fleeing from the 1983 internal security crackdown in north and
 west Kampuchea have reported torture by Vietnamese and Heng
 Samrin forces during interrogation to uncover resistance
 sympathizers. Beatings are the most common form of torture
 reported, but there have been claims of suffocation with
 plastic bags or burning with boiling water. Amnesty
 International in 1983 cited a report that persons detained for
 participating in meetings of Christians had been tortured to
 force them to confess. While torture may occur in Khmer Rouge
 areas, its extent is unknown. There is no evidence of torture
 in non-Communist resistance camps.
 There have been numerous of report of harassment, robbery, and
 rape of Khmer by Vietnamese troops.  According to some sources,
 Khmer who protest to Heng Samrin authorities about these acts
 are subject to retaliation by Vietnamese soldiers. There have
 been refugee reports that Heng Samrin military officers who
 interfered with such Vietnamese behavior were subsequently
 arrested by Vietnamese forces.
 Conditions in political prisons both in Phnom Penh and in rural
 areas are harsh. The central prison in Phnom Penh holds a
 number of political prisoners. One recent arrival at the Thai
 
 
 798
 border, who was a prisoner from September 1980 to November
 1982, said that prisoners were chained on bare concrete floors
 with no sanitary facilities, blankets, or mosquito nets.
 Prisoners had to lie on their sides in narrow spaces. He
 reported that food was inadequate and that there had been
 deaths from both malnutrition and beatings. Some prisoners, he
 said, were kept in total isolation and darkness. Earlier
 reports, including two from former inmates, noted no provision
 of medical care or medicines, clothing, or soap.
 d.   Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 There was an increase in 1983 in detention and interrogation,
 without formal charges, of suspected resistance sympathizers.
 There have also been purges of "unreliable" Heng Samrin
 administrators in at least one province in northwest
 Kampuchea. A variety of informants claim that the Heng Samrin
 regime arrests persons who are suspected of being members of
 resistance groups; who refuse to employ their skills in the
 service of the regime or seek to resign their employment for
 other than medical causes; or who have family members believed
 to have joined the resistance. Political prisoners are said to
 include children as well as adults. Regulations of the Heng
 Samrin regime call for the arrest and "re-education" of "any
 person carrying out propaganda campaigns to sabotage internal
 unity and Kampuchea-Laos-Vietnam solidarity." Such
 "re-education" means indefinite detention to force a change in
 political values. The 1983 Amnesty International report
 expressed concern about the detention without trial of persons
 suspected of anti-regime activities.
 Non-combatants caught trying to flee to Thailand from Khmer
 Rouge areas have been sentenced to several days "re-education"
 through lectures and incarceration. Some Khmer Rouge zones
 have meted out harsh punishment for attempted defections to
 non-Communist groups. Khmer Rouge forces driven out of rural
 areas by the Vietnamese in early 1983 reportedly forced some of
 the local population to retreat with them.
 e.   Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Political prisoners under the Heng Samrin regime are regularly
 denied the right to a trial. The best estimate is that several
 thousand political prisoners are held by the Heng Samrin regime.
 The Heng Samrin regime has reestablished courts and begun to
 develop a legal system. In those few instances where trials
 were reported, long jail sentences have been meted out, some at
 hard labor. One Khmer tried in Phnom Penh in June 1982 for
 suspected support of the resistance described a "pre-trial"
 study period in which he was rehearsed on exactly how to answer
 questions. According to the source, the court consisted of a
 judge, prosecutor, and a panel of 13 members, including four
 Vietnamese. The prosecutor asked only the questions
 rehearsed. There was no defense attorney or cross-examination
 before the judge decided the case. Neither the Khmer Rouge
 zones nor the non-Communist camps have separate judicial
 systems apart from their civil and military administrations.
 f.   Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 
 
 799
 Heng Samrin local authorities search whenever they wish.
 Surveillance increased as part of the 1983 internal security
 crackdown. Networks of informers report to the secret police.
 Vietnamese forces are assigned down to the village level to
 monitor the Heng Samrin internal security apparatus, which they
 do not consider reliable. Although the government has
 guaranteed the right of private land ownership, it has used
 coercion at times to force people into collectives.  There are
 also reports that the Vietnamese and the Heng Samrin regimes
 have begun forcing villagers to relocate into fortified
 villages in an effort to reduce their contact with resistance
 forces. Forced labor for military and civilian construction
 projects is a regular aspect of life in Kampuchea.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a.   Freedom of Speech and Press
 The press and radio are wholly controlled by the regime.
 Criticism of the regime is not tolerated, nor are foreign books
 and periodicals admitted except those officially distributed.
 There have been reports of arrests for listening to foreign
 radio broadcasts. A similar situation exists in the Khmer
 Rouge areas.
 b.   Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The only associations permitted in Heng Samrin areas are for
 groups such as farmers, women, and youth, which have been
 created by the regime. Labor is totally under the regime's
 control. Industries have organized branches of the official
 Trade Union for National Salvation. The Khmer Rouge and
 non-Communist resistance areas do not have associations or
 trade unions.
 c.   Freedom of Religion
 While in power in Phnom Penh, the Khmer Rouge dismantled
 the previous state religion, Buddhism, defrocking some 70,000
 monks, forcing many to marry and all to labor, and turning
 pagodas into warehouses. Since they lost power in 1978, they
 have tried to give the impression of reform. They have built
 pagodas in their zone at Phnom Melai and in January 1982
 welcomed a senior Khmer monk visiting from abroad. In 1983 a
 foreign journalist traveling with the Khmer Rouge within
 Kampuchea photographed Khmer Rouge soldiers paying their
 respects to Buddhist monks. Christianity and Islam were even
 more ruthlessly suppressed by the Khmer Rouge when they
 controlled the country, and are not known to have been revived
 in Khmer Rouge zones since then.
 The Heng Samrin regime has permitted the return of religious
 practices but has not reinstituted Buddhism as the state
 religion. In 1981 the Supreme Patriarch told journalists that
 3,000 monks had been rerobed and 700 pagodas were open.
 However, only men over 50 may officially rerobe and they must
 file a formal application to so do. A number of younger men
 have been quietly ordained with the tacit acceptance of local
 authorities. Christian groups are harassed by the Heng Samrin
 regime. The Protestant community in Phnom Penh of about 2,200
 people in 400 families is not authorized to meet. Roman
 Catholics in Phnom Penh are said to be prohibited from meeting,
 but one small community in a major rural center has reportedly
 
 
 800
 received authorization to meet on Sundays. Muslims, most of
 whom are ethnic Chams rather than Khmer, have been encouraged
 by the Heng Samrin regime to renew their religious community.
 Non-Communist resistance camps afford freedom of religion.
 d.   Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel,
 Emigration, and Repatriation
 The Heng Samrin regime tries to control tightly all travel
 within the region under its control. Passes are required for
 internal movement between villages. Checkpoints are
 ubiquitous, and bribes as well as passes are required to pass
 them, although checkpoints can often be dodged. A system of
 neighborhood surveillance, modeled after the Vietnamese system,
 was introduced in 1981. Nevertheless, thousands of Khmer
 continue to move around inside the country and to the Thai
 border to trade, look for family members, or join the
 resistance. Only the very top Heng Samrin officials travel
 abroad. Other Khmer seeking to emigrate must flee to the
 border. The Heng Samrin regime has agreed in principle to
 accept refugees back from camps in Thailand but has not taken
 any so far because it has put off reaching an agreement with
 the United Nations High Commission for Refugees on the
 mechanics of repatriation. Thousands of Khmer have returned
 informally to Kampuchea from the Thai border. Sixty-two
 thousand Khmer are still in holding centers in Thailand.
 The Khmer Rouge also tightly control movement within their
 zones and attempt to prevent the non-Communists from operating
 in or crossing what they consider their "liberated areas." The
 Khmer Rouge and the non-Communist groups have accepted people
 back from refugee camps in Thailand.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to
 Change Their Government
 The Kampuchean People's Revolutionary Party, a Communist party
 directed by a very small group of leaders, controls political
 life in the Heng Samrin regime areas, but major policies are
 established by Vietnam and many day-to-day administrative
 decisions, especially in internal security matters, are made
 unilaterally by Vietnamese officials. Both Hanoi and Phnom
 Penh have rejected any change in the system imposed following
 the Vietnamese invasion, calling the situation "irreversible."
 Political aspirants in Heng Samrin areas must study the current
 political dogma which centers on acceptance of the Vietnamese
 explananation for Hanoi's dominant position in Kampuchea.
 Relatively few Heng Samrin officials are considered reliable by
 the Vietnamese. While attempting to build an indigenous party
 and government structure in Kampuchea, Vietnam itself maintains
 control. Elections in Heng Samrin areas do not allow genuine
 political participation but rather are staged by the regime to
 demonstrate legitimacy through voter activity, and to
 underscore the relative status of leaders by varying
 percentages of the "vote." Reports suggest that in the 1981
 national elections percentages were "rigged," and some victors
 were named regardless of the number of votes they received.
 Vietnamese district level advisors were reliably reported to
 have picked candidates for lower level elections.
 In Khmer Rouge zones, the Communist Party of Kampuchea was
 formally dissolved in December 1981, but continues as a
 
 
 801
 clandestine entity. In fact, the party, in which power is
 concentrated in the hands of fewer than 10 people, controls all
 political, economic, and military life in those areas. No
 opposition is possible.
 The non-Communist political fronts are less disciplined and
 control their areas more loosely.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Human rights violations in Kampuchea have been the subject of
 intense international attention since 1978, when the United
 Nations Human Rights Commission and its Subcommission on the
 Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities began
 investigations of the problem. In February 1983 the Commission
 adopted a resolution which welcomed the formation of the
 Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea as a positive
 development, reiterated its "condemnation of persistent
 occurrence of gross and flagrant violations of human rights in
 Kampuchea," and reaffirmed "that the continuing occupation of
 Kampuchea by foreign forces deprives the people of Kampuchea
 from exercising their right to self-determination and
 constitutes the primary violation of human rights in Kampuchea
 at present." In its 1983 report Amnesty International
 expressed concern about reports of the detention without trial
 of political prisoners, about the detention and torture of
 persons who had participated in unauthorized Christian
 meetings, and about killings of civilians by Vietnamese
 troops. It also noted reports of the detention of supporters
 of opposition groups including the Khmer Rouge, the Khmer
 People's National Liberation Front, and Prince Sihanouk's
 group, as well as arrests for non-violent opposition to the
 Government. Freedom House considers Kampuchea "not free" and
 assigned its lowest ratings in 1983 with the observation that
 "Cambodians continue to be one of the world's most tyranized
 peoples."
 Anti-Vietnamese resistance forces have charged that the Heng
 Samrin regime and Vietnamese forces are using prohibited
 chemical weapons against them. In 1981 the U.N. General
 Assembly called on the Secretary General to establish a team to
 investigate these charges. The Heng Samrin regime and its
 Vietnamese backers refused to cooperate with the investigation
 and denied the U.N. team permission to enter Kampuchea.
 The non-Communist camps along the Thai-Kampuchean border have
 substantial daytime presences of voluntary and international
 organization staff who have intervened to secure better
 treatment of minorities, such as Vietnamese refugees. Both the
 Heng Samrin regime and the Khmer Rouge areas have Red Cross
 organizations, but neither they nor any other groups in those
 areas have a role in the protection of human rights.
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 After years of fighting within Kampuchea, statistics about the
 economic, social, and cultural situation are unreliable. The
 population in 1983 was estimated to be about six million, close
 to the 1962 census figure of 5,729,000, with a growth rate of
 two percent. The infant mortality rate was estimated at 21 per
 1,000 live births, although the actual figure is probably march
 
 
 802
 higher in view of widespread serious problems of nutrition,
 sanitation, and medicine.
 The Heng Samrin regime has tried to restore some parts of the
 traditional culture, reversing Khmer Rouge efforts to
 completely restructure the society and remold individual
 personality. The regime has promoted traditional music and
 dance and has reopened some primary schools and selected
 university faculties, such as medicine and dentistry. It
 claims a total primary and secondary school population of 1.7
 million and announced that it has brought literacy to 567,000
 adults during the past three years, or 55 percent of those
 formerly classified as illiterate.
 Kampuchea is now, even more than before 1970, an agricultural
 country. Earlier trends toward urbanization were reversed when
 the Khmer Rouge forcibly evacuated the entire urban population
 in 1975. Since the Vietnamese invasion, urbanization has
 resumed, but many of the former city people, including Chinese
 merchants, have fled abroad. Khmer peasants have flowed into
 Phnom Penh in search of food and work. The embryonic Khmer
 enterpreneurial class faces overwhelming competition from
 Vietnamese who have flowed into commercial activities in market
 towns through eastern Kampuchea and in Phnom Penh itself. In
 1982, the Heng Samrin regime issued party and government
 directives facilitating Vietnamese settlement in Kampuchea.
 The Heng Samrin regime has claimed that only 56,000 Vietnamese
 have settled in Kampuchea, while resistance groups have
 reported the total to be as high as 700,000 in a calculated
 policy of "Vietnamization." Reports from border travelers
 indicate that many new Vietnamese have moved into Kampuchea to
 join returning residents who had fled or been expelled during
 the Khmer Republic or Khmer Rouge periods. Most are traders or
 fishermen, but a large group of Vietnamese farmers settled on
 rich marshland in Takeo Province beginning in late 1981. There
 have been reports of Vietnamese taking advantage of their
 privileged status to force Khmer Out of desirable occupations
 or land.
 In the rural areas, the Heng Samrin regime has instituted a
 system of agricultural collectivization to till the main rice
 fields. Vietnam has said that 90 percent of Khmer peasants
 have been organized into more than 100,000 "solidarity
 production" teams. The Constitution permits families to own
 the small plot on which a house and garden exist. Other land
 is owned collectively, although in practice most farm
 production is not yet organized collectively. Forced labor has
 been a regular feature of rural life in Kampuchea since 1981.
 Villagers, male and female, single and, in some areas, married,
 are drafted out of their home villages to the work areas.
 Reportedly, these villagers must provide their own food. In
 some cases, food has run out, and local authorities were forced
 to send the villagers home.
 The health, medicine and nutrition deficiencies of recent years
 are only slowly being overcome. An inadequate number of Khmer
 medical personnel at all levels has been supplemented by
 foreign medical teams. Despite the presence of these teams and
 a reportedly large number of Vietnamese health cadre, medical
 care even in the best hospitals in Kampuchea is barely
 adequate, and most Khmer have no access to medical care at
 all. Kampuchea is subject to of tropical diseases and to an
 especially virulent strain of malaria. Preventive measures for
 mosquito-borne diseases no longer exist. The emergency relief
 needs that led to the massive international food relief
 operation beginning in 1979 have been essentially fulfilled.
 Nevertheless, the nutritional situation remains precarious. In
 the most severe food deficit provinces of the country, up to 60
 percent of children under 13 years old are reported to suffer
 from moderate or severe malnutrition.
