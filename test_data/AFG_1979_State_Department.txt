 AFGHANISTAN
 The government of Babrak Karmal was installed by a Soviet-
 executed coup on December 27, 1979. Soviet invading forces
 totalling over 80,000 remain in Afghanistan and already have
 participated in counterinsurgency operations on the ground
 and by air. This massive violation of Afghanistan's sovereignty
 is denying the religious and fiercely independent Afghan
 people their right to self-determination. According to recent
 reports, the Soviets may be employing lethal chemical agents
 as well as incendiary devices in their efforts to suppress
 the Afghan resistance.
 The December 27 coup was the fourth in about 6 years. Mohammed
 Daoud overthrew King Zahir Shah in July 1973 and instituted
 the Republic of Afghanistan. Daoud himself was deposed by a
 military coup which resulted in a new regime under the People's
 Democratic Party of Afghanistan. The pro-Soviet Democratic
 Republic of Afghanistan's first President, Noor Mohammed Taraki,
 was deposed by Hafizullah Amin in September 1979. Amin himself
 was killed during the December 27 Soviet invasion. Afghanistan
 has not had a constitution since 1978 when Daoud's republican
 document was scrapped by the revolutionary regime.
 Afghanistan is one of the world's least developed and poorest
 nations. Much of the country's meager human and economic
 resources are being consumed by continuing domestic conflict
 which has raged at rising levels of intensity since the
 April 1978 revolution. An important motivation spurring
 those who are struggling to overthrow the Soviet-supported
 Democratic Republic of Afghanistan has been the regime's
 repressive domestic policies and disregard for basic human
 rights. Those policies, coupled with the sporadic violence
 associated with internecine conflicts, have created an
 atmosphere of fear and apprehension among the great majority
 of the country's population. Torture, arbitrary arrest,
 extended and unexplained imprisonment, and execution became
 commonplace under the regimes of Presidents Taraki and Amin.
 Indications are that these policies will continue under the
 new regime of Babrak Karmal.
 1.   Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom From:
 a. Torture-
 Victims, as well as other eyewitnesses, have reliably reported
 that torture is widely employed by the authorities. Use of
 electrical devices to extract information or simply to punish
 is reportedly one of the regime's most commonly employed torture
 practices. More traditional personal violence, such as
 beatings, incarceration under extremely crowded conditions, and
 deprival of proper food and sanitary facilities, is also
 widespread.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Numerous instances of cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment
 or punishment have occurred, especially with regard to those
 
 (707)
 
 
 708
 who have been suspected of participating in or plotting
 "counter-revolutionary" activity. Executions of political
 prisoners, both "prisoners of conscience"--those whom the
 regime suspects could represent a political threat to the
 revolution--and those who have taken more active steps
 against what they perceive as a despotic government,
 continue and have been estimated by some to total over
 5,000. The new regime headed by Babrak Karmal has claimed
 that "tens of thousands" of Afghans were executed under
 former President Amin. Most occurred at Pul-I-Charki
 prison, just outside Kabul, where as many as 15,000 people
 may be incarcerated without trial. According to reliable
 reports, summary executions, which for many months have
 been between twenty and fifty persons per night, continue
 at Pul-I-Charki. Reports of atrocities resulting from the
 domestic conflict have become more frequent of late as the
 intensity of the fighting has increased. Reported acts of
 ferocity by government troops have included mass rapes of
 female members of villages suspected of harboring insurgents,
 as well as maimings and murders of other villagers suspected
 of similar "crimes." For their part, the insurgents too
 have engaged in acts of brutality, including summary
 executions of captured military officers, looting of
 villages, maiming and disfigurement of prisoners, and
 disregard for the safety of innocent bystanders during
 attacks on government personnel and installations.
 c. Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 Arbitrary arrest has been a common feature of Afghan life
 under this and previous governments. Numerous individuals
 are known to have been seized by the authorities for no
 apparent reason, held for weeks or months, and in many
 cases, released with no explanation and certainly with no
 formal trial ever being held. Others simply disappeared.
 In 1979, three general amnesty programs were announced, two
 aimed at those Afghans who fled to Pakistan, and one
 directed at those who fled their homes but remained within
 the country. Firm evidence is skimpy, but apparently none
 of these programs has met with any great success. In
 accordance with Afghan tradition, former President Taraki
 pardoned 464 persons on the occasion of the Id-al-Fitr
 religious holiday. Former President Amin claimed to have
 released over 1,000 prisoners in a campaign to free "un-
 justly" held persons, but most appear to have been ordinary
 criminals.  (The release of common, as opposed to political,
 criminals would make no meaningful dent in the country's
 prison population.) The new regime of Babrak Karmal claims
 to have released ten thousand prisoners--although the
 actual numbers released appear to be much smaller--and has
 announced that an undetermined number of others are still
 being held. Martial law was declared briefly following the
 August 5, 1979, mutiny of part of the Army garrison at Bala
 Hissar Fort in Kabul. In reality, the country has been in
 a modified state of Martial Law since the April 1978 revolution.
 d. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Most individuals accused of non-political civil and criminal
 offenses were tried according to provisions in the penal
 code in force under the previous regime. Those provisions
 
 
 709
 include a guarantee of public trial in civilian courts, with
 the usual rights to legal counsel, appeal, and confrontation
 of witnesses. Under Amin, the regime announced the estab-
 lishment of the "Khalqi (People's) Specialized Primary
 Court" and the "Khalqi Specialized Final Court." According
 to press reports, these courts were to deal with "crimes
 committed against the Revolution, against the peoples'
 interest and national interests, and against the internal
 and external security" of the country. The regime also
 announced September 10 the codification of law for "extra-
 ordinary revolutionary trial, and specialized prosecution by
 the Afghan internal security organization." After his
 September 16 takeover of power, Amin announced the creation
 of an "extraordinary revolutionary court" to handle the
 cases of'perSons charged with political offenses. He
 claimed that "legality, security, and justice" henceforth
 would prevail, and that no one would be imprisoned without a
 trial.
 e. Invasion of the Home
 Forced entry into private homes by military or civilian
 representatives of the government, especially during the
 late night curfew hours, has been common. Night-time
 arrests are frequent, many of which appear to be a form of
 intimidation against individuals.
 2.   Government Policies Relating to the Fulfillment
 of Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care
 and Education:
 Afghanistan is primarily an agricultural country, with much
 of the rural economy traditionally organized on feudal
 lines. The illiteracy rate is high (about 90 percent) as is
 the mortality rate (life expectancy is about 40 years). The
 regimes promulgated and initiated policies designed to
 convert feudal Afghanistan into a state "void of exploita-
 tion of man by man," with "brother socialist states" as its
 models.
 The regimes have stated ambitious goals for bringing about
 an improvement in the average Afghan's standard of living.
 The new regime abandoned the previous government's seven-
 year plan and announced plans for a new five-year plan,
 although only the first year of the new plan thus far has
 been made available. The Government has committed itself
 publicly to an ambitious program of economic development
 emphasizing the following goals: land reform, the abolition
 of usury, adult literacy, equal rights for women, reduction
 of unemployment, revision of the tax system, strengthening
 of the public sector, and improving health care.
 The current political instability and insurgency in the
 countryside, however, have not permitted the regimes to
 carry out programs they say were designed to improve social
 and economic conditions in Afghanistan.
 Revolutionary Degree Six represented the first step in land
 and credit reform programs. Aimed at feudal landlords and
 usurers, it reduced or eliminated peasants' debts and mortgages.
 Despite the theoretical benefits of this program, alternative
 
 
 710
 sources of agricultural credit have not been provided to the
 majority of small farmers. The government's ambitious land
 reform program, which limited land holdings to 15 acres of
 "first class land" or its equivalent, and redistributed
 "excess" lands to deserving peasants and nomads, encountered
 serious opposition. Though apparently far short of its
 goals, the land reform program was declared "successfully
 completed" in mid-1979.
 Elimination of corruption, endemic to Afghan society, remains
 a stated goal of the government. Although a few arrests of
 corrupt officials have taken place, corruption of various
 sorts reportedly persists, especially in connection with the
 issuance of passports and visas. The practice of offering
 bribes to elicit action by government officials has not
 diminished.
 3.   Respect for Civil and Political Liberties
 Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and
 Assembly
 The Karmal government, like its predecessors, controls all
 the media. It exerts much stricter control over content,
 and uses the press to convey and reflect official policy
 more than did the previous government. The Government
 insists that it respects Islam, but many devout Afghans view
 these assurances with suspicion. The persecution and execu-
 tion of prominent Muslim religious leaders has antagonized
 many traditional and religious Afghans. Available evidence
 indicates that minority citizens such as Sikhs, Hindus, and
 Jews are permitted to practice their faiths without interference.
 Political assembly is permitted only in support of the
 government.
 Labor organizations, existed neither under the monarchy nor
 under the Daoud government. Since the revolution, it was
 announced that scores of unions have formed nationwide and
 have been established in several ministries and larger
 industries. These organizations have a reported membership
 of over 170,000. Unions are not given the right to strike
 or to oppose the government's policies. Nonetheless, the
 new regime's ideology reflects concern for the status of
 workers. Workers received certain benefits under the Taraki
 and Amin regimes. According to the Director-General of
 Labor, literac,- :ourses have been established in every
 factory in Afghanistan. The Government is inzreasing zhe
 number of health centers near factories. The Government has
 issued coupons to enable workers to purchase less expensive
 staples from coo2eratives. Afghanistan's labor law, issued
 in 1946, remains the basic document governing labor and
 employment practices of the country, although the present
 government has indicated it shortly will publish a new labor
 law.
 For centuries, Afghan society has been dominated by the
 Pushtun ethnic group, which forms about one-half of the
 population. Others, such as Hazaras, Tajiks, and Uzbeks
 historically have been victims of direct and indirect
 discrimination. Several stated goals of the regime include
 the assimilation of all ethnic groups into the political,
 social and economic mainstream of the country. Despite the
 inclusion of some members of ethnic minority groups in the
 Cabinet, the top political and military leadership remains
 dominated by Pushtuns.
 
 
 711
 Despite steady and slow progress made during the 1960's and
 1970's, women occupy an inferior status in this traditional
 society. In 1975, the literacy rate for women was negli-
 gible, with 98.5 percent receiving no education at all.
 Today, participation by women in the process of socio-
 economic development in Afghanistan remains largely un-
 realized, though the present regime appears sincerely to be
 concerned with improving the status of women. "The ensuring
 of equality of rights of women with men in all social,
 economic, political and civil aspects" is a stated goal of
 the government. Increasingly, Afghan women are participating
 in a number of health-related programs, both as contributors
 and as beneficiaries. The role of women in Afghanistan is
 emerging slowly from the restrictions imposed by a conserva-
 tive religious society.
 b. Freedom of Movement within the Country, Foreign
 Travel and Emigration
 Restrictions on travel within the country exist, imposed
 both by the Government and by the realities of the rural
 insurgency. Permission for foreign travel, difficult to
 obtain under previous governments, has been curtailed even
 more by the present regime. Emigration is more strictly
 controlled than it was under the former government.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political
 Process
 Afghanistan is an authoritarian one-party state ruled by the
 People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan (PDPA). All major
 decisions are made by a small group who form the Party's
 politburo. Amin once claimed that the PDPA has about
 100,000 members out of a population of approximately 14
 million, but the actual number of active members is probably
 a fraction of this. Membership in the only legal party is a
 prerequisite for effective political participation and
 professional advancement. Opposition parties do not exist
 and any perceived opposition is treated harshly. Amin named
 a commission to draft a new constitution for Afghanistan--to
 replace the previous constitution which was scrapped after
 the revolution--but these efforts now appear suspended for
 the time being. The Karmal regime has promised a new
 constitution and national elections but has named no date
 for either event.
 4.   Government Attitudes and Record Regarding Inter-
 national and Non-Governmental Investigations of
 Alleged Violations of Human Rights:
 n International Committee of the Red Cross (CCr:) repi-e-
 sentative who visited Afghanistan three times in 1978 was
 permitted to visit some prisoners. in accordance with 7CRC
 practice, the reresentetive issued no public s-zatezsn
 regarding his findings.
 An officia. Amnesty 7nternazional mission visited Afchanisran
 in October 1978, and was received bv then Deputy Prime
 Minister Amin. Amnesty International issued a report in
 September, 1979, charging the Afghan Government with specific
 violations of five articles of the Universal Declaration of
 Huan Rights. AI continues to voice its concerns regarding
 the human rights -ituation in Afghanistan. The Afghan
 regimes have stated repeatedly that representatives of
 "impartial" international human rights organizations will be
 welcome to come and examine the situation. Newly appointed
 Foreign Minister Dost reaffirmed this stance recently in
 remarks at the UN.
 The UN High Commission for Refugees has agreed to provide
 humanitarian assistance to over 400,000 Afghan refugees in
 Pakistan. This has provoked negative political reactions by
 the Afghan government.
