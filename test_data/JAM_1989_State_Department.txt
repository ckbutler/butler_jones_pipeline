 Jamaica, a member of the Commonwealth of Nations, is a
 constitutional parliamentary-democracy. A Governor General,
 appointed by the Crown on the advice of the Prime Minister,
 represents the Queen as Head of State, while the elected Prime
 Minister, the leader of the majority party in Parliament, is
 the country's chief executive. The Parliament is comprised of
 an elected House of Representatives and a Senate appointed by
 the Governor General.
 Two major political parties have alternated in power since the
 first elections under universbl suffrage in 1944. The maximum
 length of a parliament is 5 years, and the Constitution
 requires that a general election be held no more than 3 months
 after the dissolution of Parliament. The last election, held
 in February 1989, resulted in Michael Manley's People's
 National Party (PNP) winning 45 of the 60 seats in the House
 of Representatives. The opposition Jamaica Labor Party (JLP),
 which formed the government from 1980 to 1989, holds the
 remaining 15 seats.
 The security forces are directed by the Ministry of National
 Security and consist of the Jamaica Constabulary Force
 (JCF-police),- the Jamaica Special Constabulary Force (JSCF-an
 auxiliary police force), and the Jamaica Defense Force (JDF).'
 Since 1974 the JDF has been-authorized to conduct joint
 operations with the JCF to maintain peace and order under the
 Suppression of Crime Act.
 Jamaica has a mixed economy emphasizing the private sector and
 based on tourism, bauxite and alumina production, light
 manufacturing, and agriculture. The Manley Government is
 pursuing policies which promote private investment, both
 domestic and foreign, in order to stimulate economic growth
 and modernization.
 In 1989 human rights were generally respected in Jamaica, but
 there continued to be credible reports that the police rely
 excessively on the use of lethal force, particularly in
 dealing with criminal suspects. This continues to be the
 country's most persistent human rights problem.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 Officially sanctioned murder of political opponents does not
 occur in Jamaica. However, some violent crime has political
 overtones. Both major parties, as well as the Communist
 Workers Party of Jamaica, have some supporters who
 occasionally resort to violence toprevent supporters of rival
 parties from engaging in legitimate political activities, such
 as holding'rallies or voting, and to punish those believed to
 have harmed their party's interests. The legal system has
 often been ineffective in dealing with cases of presumed
 -politically motivated killing because of a code of silence
 adhered to by suspects, victims, and witnesses alike.
 Intimidation of witnesses and jurors also complicates efforts
 to prosecute offenders.
 Violence aimed at disrupting the political process is
 heightened during elections. As a step toward reducing
 
 
 645
 JAMAICA
 election-related violence, the two major political parties in
 1988 engaged in talks aimed at defusing tensions between the
 parties and between JLP and PNP partisans. On August 26,
 1988, the two party leaders signed a "political code of
 conduct" intended to reduce election-related violence. An
 Ombudsman was appointed to monitor compliance with the
 agreement and to report violations. As a result of these
 efforts, the electoral campaign of 1988-89 was relatively
 peaceful, and the number of persons killed decreased from
 several hundred in the previous contested national election to
 12 in the most recent one.
 The incidence of violent crime remains high in Jamaica. There
 continue to be credible reports of excessive use of lethal
 force by the police in dealing with suspected criminals.
 According to police statistics, officers killed 91 persons and
 wounded 63 in shooting incidents through the end of August
 1989. Eight police officers were killed and 22 wounded in the
 line of duty during the same period. The disparity between
 the ratio of persons killed by police to those wounded has led
 several human rights groups to charge that some officers are
 engaging in summary executions of suspects.
 Both local and international human rights groups have
 criticized the fact that the JCF itself is responsible for
 investigating police abuses. In July, National Security
 Minister K.D. Knight announced plans to establish an
 independent body to review complaints against members of the
 force, but as of the end of the year no action had yet been
 taken.
 b. Disappearance
 There is no evidence of abduction, hostage-taking, or
 disappearances perpetrated by the security forces. Using the
 power granted under the Suppression of Crime Act to take
 persons into custody without an arrest warrant, however, the
 JCF has on occasion held incommunicado for varying periods
 persons suspected of criminal activities. In nearly all these
 cases, the detainee was released once relatives or associates
 protested.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Torture and other abuse of prisoners and detainees is
 prohibited by law. Nonetheless, suspected criminals are often
 beaten or mistreated by police while being held in local
 stations. In 1989 there were numerous complaints of police
 brutality, including reports of beatings by guards and
 security personnel of inmates held in prisons. Figures on
 human rights abuses by police are unavailable. As of October,
 92 police officers had been placed on adminstrative leave
 pending resolution of criminal conduct cases, many of which
 involved minor offenses. A number of policemen were convicted
 and punished. To address identified shortcomings in police
 performance, the JCF is receiving training in police
 investigative techniques from the U.S. Justice Department's
 International Criminal Investigative Training Program, and is
 engaged in a law enforcement accreditation program.
 In past years, some persons have brought suit successfully
 against the police for unlawful actions, and the Government
 has been required to pay damages. According to police
 statistics, 200 complaints were filed against police between
 
 
 646
 JAMAICA
 January and August of 1989, of which more than half alleged
 assault by JCF officers. Almost $200,000 was paid out in
 damages following successful lawsuits against police during
 that period.
 Violence in the prisons is commonplace, with both prisoners
 and guards subject to assault. Prison guards allegedly beat
 to death two inmates during disturbances following a July
 hunger strike at the Kingston General Penitentiary.
 Government investigations into the incident had not been
 completed by year's end. At the St. Catherine District
 Prison, where 200 death row inmates are housed in cells built
 for 60, guards temporarily stopped feeding inmates in August,
 following a series of attacks by heavily armed prisoners.
 Commercial guard forces, which have proliferated in recent
 years due to the high crime rate, continue to be the subject
 of complaints, especially concerning the use of excessive
 force. According to the Jamaica Council for Human Rights
 (JCHR), private security guards killed 40 persons in 1988;
 figures were not available for 1989 at year's end. There are
 currently more than 200 private security firms in Jamaica, and
 many often hire less qualified applicants than the police and
 provide less training. Some guard company recruits have been
 found to have criminal records. Licensing for commercial
 guard forces is the subject of draft legislation being
 considered by the Government.
 Lynching of individuals accused of theft of goods, livestock
 or crops, housebreaking, or rape occurs with some frequency in
 Jamaica. Such incidents are reported in the media, but
 prosecutions of vigilantes remains rare.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Under the Suppression of Crime Act, which has been regularly
 extended at 6-month intervals since its adoption in 1974,
 security forces do not need a warrant to detain persons
 "reasonably" suspected of having committed a crime. Although
 the Act was conceived as an extraordinary measure, security
 ,forces have come to rely on it extensively. Detention of
 suspects without a warrant occurs regularly, particularly in
 poor neighborhoods.
 In July the Government lifted the Act in 7 of Jamaica's 14
 parishes. However, government officials warned that it could
 be reintroduced inthose areas if there is a significant
 increase in crime. In areas where the Act has been lifted,
 reports indicrate that police are relying on blank, presigned
 warrants to meet the new legal requirements.
 Police must record detentions and are responsible for ensuring
 that detainees appear before a member of the judiciary within
 24 hours of detention. Most detainees are held for 3 to 5
 days. However, there have been instances of detainees being
 held for 9everal weeks without being brought before a judicial
 officer. Many detainees are unaware of their right to timely
 judicial review of the grounds for their detention. The JCHR
 indicates that 90 percent of its caseload involves assisting
 people attempting to locate and gain the release of detained
 family members. The JCHR reports that supervisory police
 officers have been more cooperative in recent years in
 providing information about detained persons.
 For suspects charged with a crime, there is a functioning bail
 
 
 647
 system. Bail is set by the local police supervisor in minor
 cases. A judicial officer sets bail for those charged'with
 more serious crimes. Persons unable to make bail while
 waiting for a judicial hearing are often detained for long
 periods. Outsiders are permitted access to the accused.
 There are no political prisoners.
 With regard to forced or compulsory labor, see Section 6.c.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Persons who have been charged with criminal offenses have
 access to legal representation, and legal counsel is provided
 to indigents in criminal cases. The Court of Appeal and the
 Parliament may refer cases to the Judicial Committee of the
 Privy Council in the United Kingdom. The judicial system,
 though independent, is overburdened and operates with
 inadequate resources. Budgetary shortfalls have resulted in a
 steady attrition of trained personnel, causing further "
 delays. Some cases take years to come to trial, and others
 have had to be dismissed because case files could not be
 located. In August 120 prisoners at the Kingston General
 Penitentiary went on a short hunger strike to protest long
 delays in processing their cases. Some of these prisoners had
 been held for more than 4 years awaiting trial or decisions on
 their appeals. The Chief Justice in an October speech called
 attention to the shortage of court reporters, clerks of the
 court, and lawyers prepared to work for the Government. A
 labor action by court employees in late 1989 further
 exacerbated difficulties in processing cases rapidly.
 A special Gun Court, established in 1974, considers all cases
 involving the illegal use or possession of firearms and
 ammunition. Public attendance is restricted, and less
 stringent rules of evidence are used. In capital cases,
 hearings before the Gun Court serve as preliminaries to jury
 trials under the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court.
 According to the JCHR, one of the weakest areas of Jamaican
 justice is the inability of the police to provide witnesses
 with proper protection. Intimidation, even murder, of
 witnesses is a chronic problem hampering criminal
 prosecutions, and jurors are sometimes threatened by
 associates of criminal defendants. The parliamentary
 Ombudsman has reported instances in which similar threats and
 intimidation are directed against witnesses and jurors in
 criminal cases where the accused is a policeman. Some
 convictions have been obtained for such attempts to subvert
 the judicial system. In August the Government announced plans
 to implement a protective custody program for threatened
 witnesses. By yearns end the program had not yet been
 implemented.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Constitution prohibits arbitrary intrusion by the State
 into the private life of the individual. Under the
 Suppression of Crime Act, however, search warrants are not
 required to enter homes or businesses believed to be occupied
 by persons "reasonably" suspected of having committed a crime,
 and this authority is sometimes abused by the police. In July
 the Act was declared no longer applicable in 7 of Jamaica's 14
 parishes (see Section l.d.). Regulations approved by
 Parlipment in 1980 require that every effort be made by
 
 
 648
 security forces to have the owner or occupant of the premises
 present during any search.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Freedom of speech and press are provided for in the
 Constitution and are observed in practice within the broad
 limits of libel laws and the State Secrets Act. Jamaica's
 largest privately owned newspaper, The Daily Gleaner, has been
 critical of Jamaican governments through the years. A new *
 national daily, The Record, appeared in 1988 and has followed
 this tradition. Several smaller newspapers and magazines are
 also published, and foreign publications are widely
 available. The government-owned Jamaica Broadcasting Company
 (JBC) operates two radio stations and the island's only
 television channel. JBC typically has been accused of bias in
 favor of the Government, by whichever party is in opposition.
 Radio Jamaica (RJR) is a privately owned broadcasting
 company. Although the Government has a 25-percent equity
 holding in RJR, the company is independent, and its broadcasts
 are often critical of government policies. A new privately
 owned FM radio station began broadcasting in 1989.
 The previous JLP Government granted three licenses to new
 regional radio stations in 1988, as part of a long-planned
 divestiture program. Two of the three regional stations were
 on the air at yea�'s end; the third was expected to begin
 broadcasting in early 1990. The Government's Broadcast
 Commission retains the right to regulate programming during
 emergencies.  In July Prime Minister Manley announced that the
 Government would retain JBC, while allowing private concerns
 to operate a new television channel and an island-wide radio
 station, but these plans have not yet been implemented. There
 are now more than 13,000 satellite antennas on the island, and
 many Jamaicans watch foreign television broadcasts without any
 government restriction.
 There is no censorship or interference in academic
 institutions.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Constitution provides for freedom of assembly and
 association. Large numbers and varieties of professional,
 business, service, social, and cultural associations function
 freely. Public rallies are staged by-all political parties.
 Such events require a police permit, which is normally
 granted. The PNP and JLP held rallies and meetings throughout
 the island during the last election campaign.
 For a discussion of freedom of association as it applies to
 labor unions, see Section 6.a.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Freedom of religion is provided for by the Constitution and is
 well established in Jamaica. More than 80 percent of the
 population belongs to various Christian denominations, and
 religious groups of all kinds operate freely. Evangelical
 Christian movements have gained a significant following, and
 foreign evangelists regularly visit.
 
 
 649
 JAMAICA
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 The Constitution provides Jamaican citizens freedom of
 movement and immunity from expulsion from the country. There
 are no restrictions on foreign travel or emigration.
 Citizenship is not revoked for political reasons.
 Those who apply for refugee status are handled on a
 case-by-case basis. The country does not often accept asylum
 seekers, primarily for domestic economic reasons. Jamaica is
 a party to the 1951 U.N. Convention and the 1967 Protocol
 Relating to the Status of Refugees.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Citizens have, and freely exercise, the right to change their
 government. The Constitution requires that, except under
 defined emergency circumstances, an election be held not later
 than 5 years after the first sitting of the preceding
 Parliament, but the Prime Minister may call national elections
 any time within that period.
 The 1989 general election, in which the PNP replaced the JLP,
 was relatively peaceful by the standard of previous Jamaican
 elections. Twelve persons were killed in election-related
 violence. Both parties worked during the electoral campaign
 to keep violence under control.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 There are no restrictions on human rights organizations in
 Jamaica. The Jamaica Council for Human Rights, the country's
 only human rights organization, has vigorously protested
 abuses by the police and has called for corrective reforms.
 The Council's work continues to be hampered by a lack of
 adequate resources. An Americas Watch representative visited
 Jamaica in 1989 and met with government officials and human
 rights activists.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Jamaican women are accorded full equality under the
 Constitution, and the 1975 Employment Act requires equal pay
 for equal work. In practice, because of cultural and social
 traditions, women often still suffer economic discrimination,
 which is frequently evidenced in hiring practices.
 Violence against women occurs with some frequency in Jamaica.
 The new Government has established a Bureau of Women's Affairs
 within the Ministry of Labor, Welfare and Sports. Several
 nongovernmental organizations exist to help victims cope with
 the effects of domestic violence, such as wife beating.
 According to officials at a crisis center, police are
 frequently unwilling to assist battered women in taking legal
 steps against their assailants. Furthermore, Jamaican law
 does not differentiate between domestic violence and general
 assault cases. Women are, therefore, often reluctant to bring
 charges under the General Offenses Against the Person Act,
 under which the only sanction available is the incarceration
 of the offender.
 
 
 650
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Article 23 of the Constitution specifically provides for the
 right to form or join a trade union, and other, more general
 articles obligate the Government to protect the person and
 property of trade unionists. In Jamaica, labor unions, like
 professional groups and private associations, function'
 freely. The Labor Relations and Industrial Disputes Act
 (LRIDA)-codifies regulations of workers' rights.
 Unions draft their own constitutions and rules, elect
 officers, determine objectives, affiliate with national or
 international groups, and select delegates to conferences.
 Some-Jamaican unions have joined democratic international
 trade secretariats, such as the Caribbean Congress of Labor
 and the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions. The
 third largest labor union is affiliated with the
 Communist-controlled World Federation of Trade Unions, and the
 World Confederation of Labor has attracted one Jamaican
 adherent.
 Jamaican law neither prohibits strikes nor provides a right to
 strike, but in practice unions and workers use the strike as a
 tool. Striking workers can interrupt work without criminal
 liability but cannot be assured of keeping their jobs. In
 1989 there were several work slowdowns as well as an 11-day
 strike involving 500 workers at an alumina plant brought about
 by a breakdown in contract negotiations. The LRIDA and other
 laws provide that certain categories of essential service
 workers (usually government-employed) do not have the right to
 strike. In its 1989 report, the Committee of Experts (COE) of
 the International Labor Organization (ILO) bited the laws,
 broad definition of essential services in which strikes are
 prohibited as restricfing the right to strike provided by the
 ILO's Convention 87 (Freedom of Association).
 About 25 percent of-the work force belongs to unions, and
 union influence is felt in all important economic sectors.
 The two largest unions, the Bustamante Industrial Trade Union
 and the National Workers Union, have organizational and
 leadership ties to the two major political parties, the JLP
 and the PNP, respectively. Both unions maintain their
 independence and sometimes take positions different from those
 of their respective parties. The third largest Jamaican
 union, the University and Allied Workers Union, is linked with
 the (Communist) Workers Party of Jamaica, whose leadership
 maintains direct control over the union.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 The Constitution provides for the right to organize and belong
 to labor unions, and IRIDA provisions include guidelines for
 labor, management, and government on issues such as organizing
 work-sites, negotiating agreements, and conflict resolution.
 However, in 1989, the COE cited the labor law's requirement of
 40-percent membership in order to negotiate an agreement as
 inconsistent with the ILO's Convention 98 (the Right to
 Organize and Collective Bargaining). Employees may not be
 fired solely because they are union officers. On the other
 hand, union affiliation may not be a prerequisite for
 employment. The Government rarely interferes with union
 organization efforts, and judicial and police authorities
 effectively enforce the LRIDA and other labor regulations.
 
 
 651
 JAMICIA
 Labor, management, and the Government remain firmly committed
 by law and in practice to collective bargaining in contract
 negotiations and conflict resolution. Collective bargaining
 is widely used, even in some nonunionized firms. When labor
 and management fail to reach an agreement, cases may be
 referred to the Ministry of Labor for arbitration or
 mediation. An Independent Industrial Disputes Tribunal (IDT)
 forms the first appeal level above the Ministry. Any cases
 not resolved by the IDT pass to the civil courts. This system
 has proved effective. However, unions and some employers
 continue to believe that the collective bargaining process is
 undermined by a 1986 LRIDA amendment which permits the
 Minister of Labor unilaterally to refer cases involving the
 national interest to the IDT.
 Domestic labor laws apply to Jamaican export free trade
 zones. Ministry of Labor officers cite a need for more
 compliance verification, especially in the free zones, but
 believe that most employers obey legal requirements. While
 domestic manufacturing companies are predominantly unionized,
 only 2 of the 18 factories in the Kingston Free Zone have
 union representation. The two unionized firms were unionized
 before they began operations in the Free Zone. Resistance by
 employers (all foreign), difficulty in unionizing female
 employees (who represent a majority of the work force in the
 free zones), and inconsistent organizing efforts are the
 reasons generally cited for the lack of additional
 unionization in the free zones. The Government is aware of
 the strong employer opposition to unions in the free zones; it
 neither discourages nor encourages unionization. Jamaicats
 second largest union has indicated its intention to organize
 workers in zone factories. During 1989 nonunionized workers
 in some free zone plants conducted short work stoppages to
 protest working conditions.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 The Constitution does not specifically address the matter of
 forced or compulsory labor. However, Jamaica is a party to
 the ILO Convention which prohibits compulsory labor, and there
 have been no allegations that this practice exists in Jamaica.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 The Juvenile Act provides that children under the age of 12
 years shall not be employed except by parents or guardians,
 and that such employment may be only in domestic,
 agricultural, or horticultural work. Children under 12 years
 of age may not be employed at night or at industrial sites.
 The Educational Act stipulates that all children aged 6 to 11
 must attend elementary school. Industrial safety, police, and
 truant officers are charged with enforcing the law.
 Enforcement is erratic, however, and children under 12 are
 sometimes seen peddling goods or services on city streets.
 There is no evidence of widespread illegal employment of
 children in other sectors of the economy.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 The LRIDA establishes some basic conditions of work. The
 Factory Act stipulates that all factories be registered and
 approved by the Labor Ministry before they can begin
 operating. The Ministry's Industrial Safety Division is
 required to make annual inspections-of all factories, but
 budget constraints reduce the number of inspections actually
 
 
 652
 JIAMAICA
 made. The Ministry maintains records on industrial accident
 victims. If a private-sector work site does not meet the
 definition of a "factory," the Ministry does not have the
 authority to inspect it.
 In accordance with International Monetary Fund guidelines,
 government *age policy aims to keep maximum annual wage and
 fringe benefit increases to 10 percent or less to help contain
 inflation. Most wage settlements have followed this
 guideline, but exceptions have been made for workers with a
 history-of inadequate pay. In a two-step process that began
 in June 1988, the Government increased minimum wage levels to
 approximately $75 per month, effective January 1,' 1989.
 Higher minimum wages apply to skilled workers, depending on
 their specialty. Most salaried workers are paid more than the
 legal minimum wage. For a worker with a family of five or
 less, the minimum wage represents a bare subsistence level.
 This level is more supportable in rural areas than in urban
 locations. The minimum wage law also provides for a 42-hour
 standard workweek and overtime pay. The Ministries of Labor,
 Finance, the Public Service, and National Security enforce
 labor laws and regulations.
