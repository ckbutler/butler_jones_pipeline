 MARSHALL ISLANDS
 The Republic of the Marshall Islands, a self-governing nation under the Compact
 of Free Association with the United States, is composed of a number of small islands
 in the central Pacific, with a total land area of about 70 square miles. The approxi-
 mately 56,000 inhabitants are of Micronesian origin and concentrated primarily on
 Majuro and Kwajalein atolls.
 The Constitution provides for free and fair elections, executive and legislative
 branches, and an independent judiciary. The legislature consists of the Nitij'ela, a
 33-member Parliament, and a Council of Chiefs (Iroij), which serves a largely con-
 sultative function dealing with custom and traditional practice. The President is
 elected by majority Nitiela vote, and he appoints his Cabinet from its membership.
 Under the Compact of Free Association, the United States is responsible for de-
 fense and national security, and the Marshall Islands has no external security force
 of its own. The national and local police forces supervised by the Ministry of Jus-
 tice, have responsibility for internal security. ihese agencies honor constitutional
 and legal civil rights protections in executing their responsibilities.
 The economy depends mainly on transfer payments from the United States. Coco-
 nut oil and copra exports, a small amount of tourism, and the expanding fishing in-
 dustry generate limited revenues.
 The Government fully respects the human rights of its citizens but its influence
 leads to occasional instances of self-censorship in sensitive political or cultural
 areas.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Kiling.-There were no reports of political or
 other extrajudicial killings.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution expressly forbids such practices, and there were no reports that
 officials employed them. Prison conditions, while Spartan, meet minimal inter-
 national standards. The Government permits visits by human rights monitors.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution prohibits arbitrary ar-
 rest, detention, or exile and the Government observes this prohibition.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial-The Constitution provides for an independent judi-
 ciary, and the Government respects this in practice.
 The Constitution provides for the right to a fair trial, and the Government gen-
 erally enforces this right. Government interest in a 1995 land-lease dispute between
 the country's largest private sector employer and two traditional chiefs contributed
 to the failure of local police to enforce a high court injunction against the chiefs.
 This unwillingness to act resulted in the company's land-lease termination and clos-
 ing of its store, one of the country's largest, despite a valid 7-year lease. The dispute
 was later settled out of court.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution provides for freedom from such practices, government authorities re-
 spect these prohibitions, and violations are subject to effective legal sanction.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of spech
 and the press, and the Government generally honors these rights in practice. How-
 ever, government influence leads to occasional self-censorship by the media in areas
 of political or cultural sensitivity. There are four operating radio stations, one gov-
 ernment owned and three privately owned, including one owned by a prominent
 
 
 674
 member of the opposition. There is a cable television comp any which normally
 shows US. programming but occasionally covers local events. The cable company is
 owned and operated by members of the political opposition.
 A U.S. citizen and longtime resident operates the country's sole privately owned
 newspaper. The editor and two reporters are U.S. citizens as well.
 The Government publishes a monthly gazette containing official news and notices
 only.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 freedom of peaceful assembly and association, and this is observed in practice.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the
 Government respects this right in practice.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriaton.-The Constitution provides for these rights, and the Government re-
 spects them in practice.
 There are no refugees, and the Government has no formal policy about them.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The Constitution provides citizens with the right to change their government
 peacefully, and citizens exercise this right through periodic, free, and fair elections
 held on the basis of universal suffrage. The Government is chosen by secret ballot
 in free and open elections every 4 years. Suffrage is universal for citizens 18 years
 of age and older. There are no restrictions on the formation of political parties, al-
 though political activity by foreigners is prohibited. The Marshall Islands has had
 the same President since 1979 due primarily to traditional loyalties and con-
 centrated political influence. In January 1996, the President was reelected by the
 Nitijela to a 4-year term.
 There are no legal impediments to women's participation in government and poli-
 tics. A woman serves as the Minister of Education, and two hold deputy minister
 positions. The mayor of Majuro, the country's capital and principal urban center,
 also is a woman. Although women have an increasing role in government, they re-
 main underrepresented in Parliament and other government positions.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigations of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 While there are no official restrictions, no local nongovernmental human rights
 organizations have been formed. No international human rights organization has ex-
 pressed interest or concern or visited the country.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The'Constitution prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex, race, color Ian-
 ereligion,   litical or other opinion, national or social origin, place of birth,
 yatatus or escent, and the Government respects these provisions.
 Women.-There are allegations of violence against women, mainly related to do-
 mestic abuse. However, this is not considered to be a serious or a widespread prob-
 lem. The Government's health office advises that few such cases are reported to the
 authorities, but many more are believed to go unreported. Assault is a criminal of-
 fense, but women are reluctant to prosecute spouses. Women's groups have been
 formed to publicize women's issues and to create a greater awareness of the rights
 of women.
 Inheritance ofproperty and of traditional rank is matrilineal, with women occupy-
 ing positions of importance within the traditional system. No instances of unequal
 pay for equal work or sex-related job discrimination were reported.
 Children.-The Government is committed to children's welfare through its pro-
 grams of health care and education, but these have not been adequate to meet the
 needs of the country's sharply increasing population. Marshall Islands is working
 to incorporate the provisions of the Convention of the Rights of the Child into law.
 The Domestic Relations Amendment of 1993 defines child abuse and neglect and
 makes them criminal offenses. Other legislation requires teachers, caregivers, and
 other persons to report instances of child abuse and exempts them from civil or
 criminal liability as a consequence of making such a report. Because the Attorney
 General's Office considers the Child Abuse Law vague and difficult to apply, ways
 to improve it are being explored. Child abuse is thought to be relatively uncommon,
 and there have been few child abuse prosecutions. The Government investigated two
 child sexual abuse cases in 1995, both involving foreign offenders. The first case re-
 sulted in a conviction on the lesser charge of assault; the second remained under
 investigation at year's end.

 People With Disabilities.-There is no discrimination against disabled persons in
 employment, education, or in the provision of other state services. Until J994 there
 were no building codes, and there is still no legislation mandating access for the dis-
 abled. There have been no reported instances of discrimination against the disabled.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution provides for the right of free asso-
 ciation in general, and the Government interprets this right as allowing the exist-
 ence of labor unions, although none have been formed to date. The Constitution does
 not provide for the right to strike, and the Government has not addressed this issue.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-There is no legislation con-
 cerning collective bargaining or trade union organization. However, there are no im-
 pediments to the organization of trade unions or to collective bargaining. Wages in
 the cash economy are determined by market factors in accordance with the mini-
 mum wage and other laws.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Constitution prohibits invol-
 untary servitude, and there is no evidence of its practice.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The law does not prohibit the em-
 ployment of children. Children are not typically employed in the wage economy, but
 some assist their families with fishing, agriculture, and other small-scale domestic
 enterprises. The law requires compulsory education for children 6 to 14; but the
 Government does not enforce this law due to a lack of classrooms and teachers.
 There is no law or regulation setting a minimum age for employment of children. -
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-There is a government-specified minimum
 wage established by law, and it is adequate to maintain a decent standard of living
 in this subsistence economy where extended families are expected to help less fortu-
 nate family members. The minimum wage for all government and private sector em-
 loyees is $2.00 per hour. (The US. dolar is the local currency.) The Ministry of
 esources and Development oversees minimum wage regulations, and its oversight
 has been deemed adequate. Foreign employees and Marshallese trainees of private
 employers who have invested in or established a business in the country are exempt
 from minimum wage requirements. This exemption does not affect a significant seg-
 ment of the work force.
 There is no legislation concerning maximum hours of work or occupational safety
 and health. Most businesses are closed and people generally refrain from work on
 Sunday. Although legislation was adopted in 1994 that shortened the workweek of
 most government employees in an attempt to cut official spending, no changes have
 been implemented.
 A government labor office makes recommendations to the Nitijela on working con-
 ditions, i.e., minimum wage, legal working hours and overtime payments, and occu-
 pational health and safety standards in accordance with International Labor Orga-
 nization conventions. The office periodically convenes board meetings that are open
 to the public. There is no legislation specifically giving workers the right to remove
 themselves from situations which endanger their health or safety without jeopardy
 to their continued employment, and there is no legislation protecting workers who
 file complaints about such conditions.
