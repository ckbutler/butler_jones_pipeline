 BUhRUNDI~
 The-Republic of Burundi is a one-party, military-controlled
 state led by President Pierre Buyoya, an army major who came
 to power in a bloodless coup in September 1987. The executive
 power is held by a 30-member Military Committee for National
 Salvation. The 22=member Cabinet appointed by the Military
 Committee is composed of 20 civilians and 2 military
 officers. While the.Military Committee is the ultimate
 decisionmaking body, the Cabinet formulates and proposes
 policies and manages the day-to-day business of government.
 The National Party for Unity and Progress (UPRONA) is the only
 political entity in Burundi. As President of the Republic and
 head of the Military Committee, Buyoya plays a dominant policy
 role. With the Constitution suspended officially, President
 Buyoya'exercises legislative and regulatory powers as well.
 After assuming power in 1987, Buyoya embarked upon a slow but
 steady campaign to promote ethnic justice. The dominance of
 the minority Tutsi over the majority Hutu ethnic group remains
 -the overriding social and political issue in Burundi. It was
 an underlying cause -of -a serious outbreak of interethnic
 violence in northern Burundi in August 1988, in which at least
 5,000 people lost their lives after Hutu peasants began
 killing local Tutsis, followed by a bloody military
 intervention to restore order. In the wake of the violence,
 the Government accelerated its policies of ethnic
 conciliation. This helped.lead to the rapid repatriation of
 the approximately 50,000 refugees who-had fled to neighboring
 Rwanda and the thousands of others who had sought refuge
 elsewhere in Burundi.
 The Burundia- armed forces, dominated by the Tutsi, are small
 in number but well equipped and well trained to maintain law
 and order. In addition, there is a regular police force
 responsible for public order and a separate force of security
 police responsible primarily for internal state security,
 including the monitoring of dissent. The State Security
 Police have the same powers of arrest as the regular police
 and are subject to the same process of judicial review.
 Burundi is a poor country with one of the highest population
 densities in Africa. The AIDS epidemic has made serious
 inroads among its 5 million people, and it is expected to
 adversely affect economic activity in coming years. Most
 Burundians (90 percent) earn theik livelihood as subsistence
 farmers working small, privately owned plots. The small
 monetary economy is based on coffee, which accounts for nearly
 90 percent of foreign exchange earnings, and other cash
 crops. Burundi is one of the highest per capita recipients of
 foreign assistance in Africa.
 While human rights continued to be restricted in several key
 areas in 1989, President Buyoya accelerated efforts to achieve
 ethnic reconciliation in the wake of the August 1988
 violence. By the early months of 1989, the repatriation and
 resettlement of nearly all of the 50,000 refugees under the
 auspices df the Quadrilateral Commission of the United Nations
 High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), Burundi, Rwanda, and
 Zaire had been completed efficiently and without serious
 incident. Throughout 1989 the Government and party undertook
 an extensive public education campaign based on dialog between
 Hutus and Tutsis. In May the National Unity Commission, a
 high-level assembly of representatives of both ethnic
 communities charged by President Buyoya with recommending
 long-term solutions to the ethnic problem, released its
 
 
 38
 report. The Commission called for sweeping changes, including
 the reestablishment of democratic institutions, the
 elimination of discriminatory employment practices,
 educational reform, and the creation of a national body to
 oversee the operations of the security services. By year's
 end, considerable progress had been made in the areas of
 education and employment, but progress was slow in integrating
 Hutus into the military forces. Major human rights concerns
 in 1989 included mistreatment of prisoners (one detainee died
 of beatings while in custody in 1989) and restrictions on
 freedom of press, assembly, and the right of citizens to
 change their government by democratic means.
 RESPECT FOR HUNAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 There were no confirmed instances of politically motivated or
 government-instigated killings in 1989. From the evidence
 that emerged in late 1988 and early 1989, including
 house-to-house censuses in the affected communes coordinated
 by international organizations, most outside observers are now
 in agreement that the August 1988 ethnic violence resulted in
 between 5,000 and 10,000 deaths. The Government acknowledged
 that innocent civilians were among the victims of the Army
 intervention, but it denied vengeance killings took place.
 There is no public information that the Government has taken
 any action to punish soldiers who may have exceeded their
 orders in using force against innocent civilians.
 b. Disappearance
 There were occasional reports by exile opposition groups of
 disappearances in Burundi during 1989, but international
 relief and human rights organizations have not been able to
 confirm any such cases. It is likely that several cases of
 disappearance connected with the ethnic violence in August
 1988 will never be resolved, given the uncertainty over the
 number of deaths and the large population flows that occurred
 in the affected areas in the following months.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Torture is forbidden by law, but cruel treatment of suspects
 or detainees has occasionally occurred in the form of beatings
 at the time of arrest or interrogation. A September 1989
 incident in which a detainee in Bujumbura died following a
 beating was documented in the government-owned newspaper,
 which reported that the officer in question was being
 prosecuted.
 Since coming to power, the Buyoya regime has allowed regular
 inspection of prison conditions by the International Committee
 of the Red Cross (ICRC). ICRC access to individuals detained
 following the ethnic violence in 1988 was restricted for
 nearly 3 months, and access to a dozen detainees suspected of
 participating in a coup plot was restricted briefly in early
 1989.   In both instances, full access was restored. Prison
 conditions remain severe due to lack of adequate hygiene,
 medical care, and food; but. the Government has begun a program
 of improving conditions.
 
 
 BlURUNDI
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Police officers are empowered to detain suspects without an
 arrest warrant but must submit a written report to the public
 prosecutor's office within 24 hours. The public prosecutor
 examines the report and can either order the release of the
 detainee or issue an arrest warrant valid for 5 days. The
 public prosecutor then must state the charges before a
 magistrate in the presence of the detainee. The magistrate
 either releases the detainee or issues orders confirming the
 detention, initially for 15 days and subsequently for 30-day
 periods as necessary to prepare the case for trial. Bail is
 set only in cases of embezzlement or similar crimes involving
 financial wrongdoing. In general, the prescribed procedures
 fox arrest and imprisonment are followed. However, time
 limits for issuance of arrest warrants and appearance before a
 magistrate are often exceeded, usually due to a shortage of
 magistrates and prosecutors. The Government has begun to
 address this problem by increasing the number of magistrates.
 There were no known political detainees at the end of 1989.
 Approximatelyo40 persons arrested in the wake of the August
 1988 violence remained in custody at the end of 1989 pending
 completion of investigations. A dozen individuals, including
 two military officers and several prominent businessman, were
 detained in Uarch in connection with an alleged coup and have
 not yet been brought to trial. Six signatories (among 27) of
 an open letter to the President criticizing the Army's role in
 the ethnic violence were released in January 1989 and allowed
 to return to their former jobs. Two other signatories were
 detained briefly in 1988. Of the others, several fled the
 country, while those who remained of this group were not
 detained. The signatory students were readmitted to the
 university.
 In June between 10 and 20 local members of the Jehovah's
 Witnesses were detained for acts of civil disobedience, such
 as refusing to salute the flag. According to reliable
 sources, all those detained were released by early fall.
 The Government does not exile its nationals as a means of
 political control. Since his ouster, Ex-President Bagaza and
 his wife have been denied permission to return to Burundi, but
 the Buyoya Government has said it is willing to negotiate the
 conditions of their return. Citizens of other countries
 suspected of criminal activity or lacking proper residency
 documents are often expelled. This occurred in April when the
 entire Libyan community, including resident diplomats, was
 expelled in the wake of an alleged coup plot.
 With regard to forced or compulsory labor, see Section 6.c.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The judiciary's independence is limited by the requirement
 that it adhere to the guidance and recorzendations of the
 party, the Government, and the President. Judges are
 appointed by and serve at the pleasure of the President. In
 general, there is a high degree of autonomy in the court's
 daily administration of justice. The President has the power
 to pardon or reduce sentences. In cases of major political
 interest, the Government has occasionally interfered with the
 judiciary.
 
 
 40
 BUEUNDI
 Burundi has -separate court systems to deal with military,
 civil/criminal, and state security cases. In early 1989, a
 new court, the Cour des Comptes (Court of Accounts), was
 established to investigate and prosecute cases of official
 corruption. While little is known about this Court's
 proceedings, it became important in 1989 in prosecuting
 high-level officials. Military tribunals have jurisdiction
 only over military personnel. The State Security Court has
 jurisdiction over both civilian and military personnel, and
 its proceedings need not be made public. To date, this Court
 has been used only once, in prosecuting ex-President Micombero
 in the mid-1970's. Burundi law provides the right to counsel,
 and indigents are provided defense counsel by the State.
 Pretrial proceedings may involve lengthy investigations. The
 courts are hampered by a lack of trained legal personnel and
 by heavy case loads.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The inviolability of the home and of private correspondence
 were provided for in the suspended Constitution and are still
 respected in practice. A judicial warrant is required for a
 law enforcement official to enter and search a private
 residence. The State Security Office monitors political
 dissent through the State Security Police and by employing
 informers who report on discontent and dissent as well as on
 criminal activity. Membership in the sole legal party is not
 required by law. There is no coercive population control.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 While there are significant restrictions on speech and press
 freedoms, since the beginning of the Buyoya regime there has
 been an unprecedented outpouring of public debate and
 questioning on formerly taboo subjects, such as ethnic
 relations and official corruption. The debate on ethnic
 relations intensified following the 1988 ethnic violence, and
 throughout 1989 party meetings were. held in every province to
 discuss the ethnic issue. Political debate is largely
 confined to UPRONA party meetings, the forum for dialog
 officially encouraged by the Government. The Government's
 tolerance for public criticism outside party forums is
 limited. Possession of opposition political tracts is a
 punishable offense, e.g., the arrest, after the August 1988
 ethnic killings, of a number of Hutu intellectuals and
 students, signatories of an open letter critical of the army's
 role, (see Section l.d.).
 The Government controls all domestic print and broadcast
 media. The French-language daily and Kirundi-language weekly
 newspapers are published by the Ministry of Information, which
 also operates the domestic radio and television stations. The
 media are traditionally required to support the fundamental
 policies of the party and the Government. Some criticism of
 the Government is permitted in the printed press, but
 journalists are state employees and subject to disciplinary
 action if their criticism goes beyond what is considered
 tolerable. The Government has interfered on occasion with the
 distribution of foreign news publications but has never
 interfered with radio reception from foreign sources. Public
 censorship occurs only in the case-of sexually explicit
 foreign film material or publications
 
 
 41
 BU1RUN1DI
 Academic freedom is limited. Primary and secondary school
 teachers are expected to support government policies. At the
 university, professors come from many different countries,
 both East and West, and are generally permitted to lecture
 freely in their subject areas, conduct research, and draw
 independent conclusions. However, two university professors
 were among the six signatories of the August 1988 open letter
 to President Buyoya who were detained for several months.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 In the aftermath of the August 1988 ethnic violence, a ban on
 public assemblies of more than five persons and a nationwide
 curfew were in effect for 2 1/2 months. No such measures were
 instituted in the spring of 1989 following the discovery of
 two coup plots. However, no political meetings or
 associations other than those tied to the ruling party are
 permitted. The Government permits nonpolitical private
 associations, but requires that they be registered and
 accorded legal recognition before they may function.
 For a discussion of freedom of association as it applies to
 labor unions, see Section 6.a.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Since coming to power, President Buyoya has made sweeping
 changes in Burundi's policies toward organized religion,
 reversing the repression of religious expression under the
 Bagaza regime. President Buyoya freed all religious
 prisoners, reopened the closed churches, returned confiscated
 church properties, including houses and schools, authorized
 weekday religious services, reinstituted the activities of
 catechists, and authorized church schools (including
 seminaries and literacy/catechism classes), publications, and
 radio broadcasts. Most of the missionaries who were expelled
 under President Bagaza are being allowed to return, and there
 are no restrictions on new missionaries.
 Organized religion, in particular the Catholic Church, plays a
 key role in the development of the country and the lives of
 both rural and urban Burundians.
 Religious expression continues to be regulated by civil laws
 and regulations. Religious organizations are subject to the
 same rules and restrictions which apply to secular
 organizations. All religious associations must receive
 approval from the Government to operate in Burundi, and a
 Burundian citizen must be appointed as legal representative of
 each association. Religious groups may not engage in
 political activity critical of the Government. During the
 Bagaza regime, two religions were banned: the Seventh-Day
 Adventists and the Jehovah's Witnesses. The Buyoya Government
 has since legally recognized the Adventist Church and returned
 all of its confiscated properties. It has, however, continued
 the ban on the Jehovah's Witnesses, allegedly because of their
 refusal to recognize the authority of the State (see Section
 l.d.). There are no barriers to the maintenance of links with
 coreligionists in other countries. Participation in religious
 groups does not exclude individuals from membership in the
 UPRONA party or from receiving social benefits.
 
 
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 The Government has not instituted restrictions on internal
 travel since the aftermath of the August 1988 ethnic violence
 in the north, when nationwide restrictions were enforced for a
 period of 2 1/2 months.
 Some 50,000 Burundian citizens fled to Rwanda following the
 1988 ethnic violence in northern Burundi. Under the terms of
 an agreement negotiated in November 1988 by the Governments of
 Burundi, Rwanda, and Zaire and the United Nations High
 Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), the Government of Burundi
 agreed inter alia to grant a general amnesty to those who had
 fled. All but a few hundred of the refugees had returned
 voluntarily to their homes by early 1989, and on May 31
 voluntary repatriation ended. As with past returning
 refugees, this group of repatriated Burundians was accorded
 full rights as citizens.
 The UNHCR reported that during the period September through
 November 1989, approximately 300 new refugees crossed from
 Burundi to the Muhero camp in Rwanda. This new outflow
 reflects residual fears in the areas affected by the events of
 August 1988. It was also probably prompted in part by police
 movements following a large-scale prison escape in the region
 in September;
 Burundi claims to host some 260,000 refugees, most of whom are
 Rwandan Tutsis who have resided in Burundi since the 1960's.
 The Government works closely with the UNHCR in refugee matters
 and does not forde resettlement. However, it has periodically
 repatriated Zairians and Rwandans who lack residence permits
 or who have been arrested on suspicion of criminal activities.
 The Government continues to discourage migration to urban
 areas through an active public education campaign. Foreign
 travel and emigration are relatively free, though travelers
 must explain the reason for their trip and must surrender
 their passports to the Immigration Office on their return to
 Burundi. Prospective Burundian travelers must have exit visas
 as well as passports.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 No mechanism exists in Burundi that allows citizens to change
 their government through democratic procedures. Since
 independence, there have been three changes -f government, all
 by military coups. When he took office, President Buyoya
 promised a new corstitution and a return to civilian rule
 within 2 years, -but progress towards these goals has been
 slow. When it released its report in May, the
 government-appointed National Unity Commission called for
 increased democratization as-a means of promoting ethnic
 conciliation, including the neinstatement of the constitution
 and the national legislature.
 Political participation takes place only within the one-party
 structure, and voters can express dissatisfaction only by
 voting against incumbents for party positions. The party is
 open to all Burundian citizens supporting its principles, and
 both men and women are active members and officeholders. The
 UPRONA party, together with its affiliated youth, women's, and
 
 
 43
 BURUNDI
 labor movements, claims a membership of approximately 1.4
 million persons, over three-quarters of the adult population.
 The party regularly holds local and regional meetings, where
 party members discuss issues and make recommendations.
 Formerly, the slate of candidates for local and national party
 offices was selected by government cadres and voted upon by
 party membership. Since President Buyoya came to power, any
 party member wishing to run for office can have his or her
 name on the ballot. Allegations that Hutus were discriminated
 against in this piocess are thought to have contributed to the
 unrest prior to the outbreak of ethnic violence in August
 1988. voting is secret in localities where members are
 literate, but ,in some rural areas where members are
 illiterdte, yoting is accomplished by a show of hands.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International bnd
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 After initially rejecting calls for an international
 investigation into the August 1988 ethnic viol~nce, the Buyoya
 Government stated that it would permit the United Nations
 Secretary General to dispatch a U.N. Information Mission to
 examine ethnic tensions and the refugee problem. This
 mission, organized by local U.N. representatives, took place
 in late 1988 and reported positively on relevant
 developments. In addition, the Government permitted extensive
 visits by outside qbservers, including the ICRC, journalists,
 diplomats, and historians.
 An Amnesty International delegation that visited Burundi in
 June urged the Government to ensure that all current detainees
 be brought to trial promptly and fairly if they face criminal
 charges, or else be'released.
 Burundi is a party to several United Nations, instruments on
 human rights. In July 1989 it ratified the Human Rights
 Charter of the Organization of African Unity.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Historically, the minority Tutsi have dominated the majority
 Hutu people. Civil strife has erupted between the two groups
 several times in the modern era, most recently in 1972 and
 1988. In both instances, a Hutu uprising that left many Tutsi
 dead was followed by military intervention that resulted in
 massive killings of Hutus. The violence was followed in both
 cases by thousands of Hutu refugees fleeing Burundi, and in
 both cases after the violence had subsided the refugees were
 encouraged by the Government to return. Unlike in 1988, large
 numbers of those who fled in 1972 remained outside the
 country. Another important dissimilarity was that the 1988
 killings were limited in area and duration, and the Government
 moved rapidly to restore ethnic confidence with the support of
 the international community. In the aftermath of the 1988
 violence, President Buyoya stepped up the pace of reform,
 appointing a Hutu Prime Minister, an ethnically balanced
 Cabinet, and a National Unity Commission to recommend
 fundamental reforms.
 De facto discrimination by Tutsis against Hutus, however,
 remains in many areas of society, although it is not condoned
 by law. There are few Hutus in the Army, and the majority of
 
 
 44
 BRUNDI
 civil service jobs, as well as university places, are held by
 Tutsis. As a result of President Buyoya's ethnic reform
 efforts, Hutus made substantial inroads into the civil service
 in 1989, and the number of Hutus entering secondary school
 exceeded the number of Tutsis for the first time in recent
 years. However, the pace of integration in the military
 remained slow. Tutsis dominate the modern economic sector,
 while in rural areas economic opportunities are roughly
 equivalent for both ethnic groups.
 Women hold a secondary position in society, although their
 status is changing slowly from traditional patterns. The
 suspended Constitution, respected in practice, provides for
 legal equality. The current legal code prohibits polygamy and
 a dowry requirement, allows women some control over family
 matters, and provides for land inheritance by women. Women in
 Burundi are able to obtain divorces, but there is strong
 social pressure against divorce.
 Traditional practices continue to prevail in many of these and
 other areas of social conduct, however. In the preponderant
 rural sector, women perform the bulk of field labor, while
 cattle raising and wage labor are generally reserved for men.
 Although fewer women than men obtain a formal education, once
 a degree is obtained women can generally find suitable
 employment. The Government has not discriminated against
 women in hiring, and the civil service pay scale makes no
 distinction between men and women. Women are not
 significantly represented in business, the professions, and at
 higher levels of government, although the situation has
 improved in recent years.
 Violence against women, especially wife beating, is known to
 take place, -but as there are not studies available, the extent
 ot the violence is difficult to quantify. Police do not
 normally intervene in domestic disputes. Severe cases are
 dealt with by the legal system. The Government officially
 discourages violence against women but addresses the problem
 largely through the Burundi Women's Union which provides
 counseling and, when deemed necessary, referral to legal
 authorities.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Burundian workers do not have the right of association as
 defined by the International Labor Organization (ILO). The
 UPRONA party controls the National Trade Union Confederation
 (UTB) and has institutionalized this single trade union
 structure by means of legislation. No other unions are
 allowed by law. The present head of the UTB was named by
 President Buyoya, but all other officeholders were elected by
 the UTB membership. The principal role of the UTB, to which
 virtually the entire salaried work force belongs, is to serve
 as an intermediary between workers and employers in labor
 matters. The UTB formulates its programs and policies in
 concert with the Ministry of Labor. Unauthorized advocacy of
 a strike or lockout is a criminal offense. Although they are
 technically permissible, there have been no strikes in recent
 years. The UTB is a member of the Organization of African
 Trade Union Unity.
 
 
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 Workers do not haye the right to organize outside the UTB.
 Within the UTB, they have the right to bargain individually
 and collectively in labor disputes. In practice, the UTB has
 often forced employers to revise their practices. This has
 usually come after implementation of one or more steps of the
 official three-step process of dispute resolution: direct.
 employer-employee discussions under the auspices of the UTB;
 an administrative hearing before a government labor inspector;
 and a legal proceeding before the labor court in which the UTB
 represents the employee. There is almost universal membership
 in UTB among salaried employees, and antiunion discrimination
 is not a problem in practice. There are no export processing
 zones in Burundi, and labor laws are applied uniformly
 throughout the country.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 While forced or compulsory labor is not permitted under
 Burundi law, the ILO Committee of Experts has noted that
 provisions of ordinances concerning the conservation and
 utilization of soils and the creation and maintenance of
 minimum areas of food crops are in violation of ILO Convention
 No. 29. It has urged the Government to bring the texts into
 conformity with the Convention and into line with what the
 Government asserts is actual practice. The Committee also
 noted that the various legislative provisions which call for
 imprisonment and an obligation to work as punishment for
 expressions of political views contrary to those of the party
 are not in compliance with ILO Convention 105. The Government
 has indicated that it intends to examine the possibility of
 revising the prison legislation, but it has not yet taken any
 action.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 In the modern, urban section of the economy, children under
 the age of 12 may not be employed in any capacity, nor may
 children under the age of 16 be engaged in dangerous or
 strenuous work. However, as a practical matter in this poor,
 largely rural country, many children are obliged by custom and
 circumstance to help their families in subsistence agriculture.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 Over 90 percent of the population of Burundi is engaged in
 subsistence agriculture. Worker rights are prescribed by the
 Burundi Labor Code and by the UTB, but these rights have
 relevance primarily for workers in the small, wage sector of
 the economy. The established minimum wage is the equivalent
 of approximately $1.03 per day in Bujumbura, and $0.90 per day
 in rural areas; this wage level is inadequate to provide a
 decent living for urban families, who frequently supplement
 their income through family gardening or small commerce.
 Wages are higher for workers in the few private sector
 businesses and in skilled jobs. Working hours vary between 40
 and 45 hours per week. Saturday afternoons, Sundays, and
 holidays are times of rest. In the modern economic sector,
 minimum health and safety standards are monitored by the
 Ministry of Labor. The enforcement of these standards is
 limited.
