 AZERBAIJAN
 Azerbaijan is a republic with a presidential form of government. Heydar Aliyev
 who assumed presidential powers after the overthrow of his democratically elected
 predecessor, was elected President in 1993. Although Azerbaijan took significant
 steps toward economic reform in 1997, it made little progress in moving toward de-
 mocracy. President Aliyev and his supporters, many from his home region of
 Nakhchivan, continue to dominate the Government, the multiparty 125-member
 Parliament chosen in the November 1995 elections, and the judiciary. The Constitu-
 tion, adopted in a November 1995 referendum, established a system of government
 based on a division of powers between a strong presidency, a legislature with the
 power to approve the budget and impeach the President, and a judiciary with lim-
 ited independence.
 After years of interethnic conflict between Armenians and Azerbaijanis, Armenian
 forces and forces of the self-styled "Republic of Nagorno-Karabakh" (which is not
 recognized by any government) occupy 20 percent of Azerbaijan's territory. A cease-
 fire was concluded in 1994, and the peace process continues. Serious clashes along
 the Azerbaijan-Armenian border and along the line of contact with Nagorno-
 Karabakh in the spring and summer caused scores of casualties. Military operations
 continued to affect the civilian population. There are 780,000 Azerbaijani refugees
 and internally displaced persons (IDP's) who cannot return to their homes. In the
 part of Azerbaijan that the Government controls, government efforts to hinder the
 opposition continue to impede the transition to democracy. In the part of Azerbaijan
 that Armenians control, a heavily militarized ruling structure prevents ethnic
 Azerbaijanis from returning to their homes.
 Police, the Ministry of Internal Affairs, and the Ministry of National Security are
 responsible for internal security. Members of the police committed numerous human
 rights abuses.
 The economy is in transition from central planning to a free market. A highly or-
 ganized system of corruption and patronage hampers economic development. The
 country has rich petroleum reserves and significant agricultural potential. Oil and
 oil products are the largest export, followed by cotton. Other key industries are
 chemicals, oil field machinery, and air conditioning equipment. However, most in-
 dustry languishes in a pst-viet depression. The Government signed five oil pro-
 duction sharing agreements with foreign oil companies in 1997, bringing the total
 to nine. In agriculture, which employs 35 percent of the labor force, the leading
 crops are cotton, grapes, tea, and tobacco. The Government continued its policies o
 fiscal and monetary austerity, inflation continued to fall, and interest rates declined
 
 
 to less than half of 1996 levels. The pace of privatization accelerated with the initi-
 ation of auction sales of shares in large state-owned enterprises. Privatization of the
 cotton gins ended the Government's monopoly on trade in cotton. Privatization of
 farmland continued, but new small farmers have poor access to credit and markets,
 and commercial agriculture remains weak. Per capita gross domestic product is
 about $300 per year. According to the World Bank, 60 percent of citizens live in pov-
 erty. Much of the labor force is "employed" by state enterprises that operate at very
 low levels of capacity and pay their workers intermittenly if at all. The overall eco-
 nomic situation of the average citizen remains precarious, although in urban areas
 a growing moneyed class with trade and oil-related interests has emerged. Economic
 opportunity depends on connections to the Government. Severe disparities of income
 have emerged that are partly attributed to patronage and corruption.
 The Government's human rights record continued to be poor, and the Government
 continued to commit serious abuses. Police beat persons in custody, and some beat-
 ings resulted in deaths. Police also arbitrarily arrested and detained persons; con-
 ducted searches and seizures without warrants; and suppressed and refused to allow
 peaceful -public demonstrations. In most instances, the Government took no action
 to punish abusers. In a variety of separate incidents, the Government arrested at
 least 19 members of the opposition Azerbaijan Popular Front Party. Prison condi-
 tions remained harsh. The entire judiciary is corrupt, inefficient, and subject to ex-
 ecutive influence. The Government holds about 120 political prisoners. The Govern-
 ment tolerated the existence of many opposition political parties, although it contin-
 ued to refuse to register some of them. The Government restricts citizens' ability
 to change their government peacefully. The Government restricted freedom of
 speech, press, assembly, association, religion, and privacy when it deemed it in its
 interest to do so. Press censorship continued, as did the Government's control over
 the broadcast media. Discrimination against ethnic minorities and societal discrimi-
 nation and violence against women are problems. Worker rights suffered a setback
 when managers in the state-owned oil industry, without a vote of the union mem-
 bership, formed a progovernment union of oil and gas workers to displace the inde-
 pendent union that had represented the interests of workers in those industries.
 Nevertheless, there were some positive signs. Scores of opposition and independ-
 ent newspapers continued to publish and discuss a wide range of sensitive domestic
 and foreign policy issues. The Government abolished military censorship and the
 press began open discussion of the issue of censorship. Opposition political parties
 carried on a variety of public activities. After 4 years of internal exile, and 2 months
 of confinement to a village, former president Elchibey returned to Baku in October
 and resumed full political activity. Although critical of certain domestic human
 rights activists, the Government was open to limited dialogue with domestic and
 international human rights organizations. The Government arrested two police offi-
 cials for inflicting injuries on detained persons that resulted in death.
 Cease-fire violations by both sides in the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict increased.
 They resulted in injuries and deaths among combatants and the taking of prisoners,
 including civilians. Insurgent Armenian forces in Nagorno-Karabakh and the occu-
 pied territories continued to prevent the return of IDP's to their homes. This restric-
 tion resulted in significant human suffering for hundreds of thousands of people.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.--Shahin Hamidov died in January as
 a result of beatings after being held for 4 days in police custody in the province of
 Barda. The provincial prosecutor opened and later closed an investigation without
 filing charges. After having been beaten in a Baku police station, Firuz Gurbanov
 died in August. The Government arrested a police official in this case, but at year's
 end there had been no further action. Samir Zulfugarov died in a Baku police sta-
 tion in August of injuries inflicted while in police custody. A police official is under
 investigation for that death. None of the three victims was involved in politics.
 There has been no action by the Government in the killing of opposition Azer-
 baijan Popular Front Member of Parliament Shakhsultan Jafarov in July 1995.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 All sides to the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict still detain prisoners. The International
 Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) visited 26 persons held in relation to this con-
 flict. In April and May, the parties freed 27 persons in a prisoner exchange. Subse-
 quently, Azerbaijan has detained three Armenians and Nagorno-Karabakh authori-
 ties have detained three Azerbaijanis. The ICRC repeatedly asked the concerned
 parties for notification of any person captured in relation to the conflict, access to
 all places of detention connected with the conflict, and release of all such persons.
 
 
 970
 The ICRC also urged the parties to provide information on the fate of persons re-
 ported as missing in action. The Government has presented to the ICRC a list of
 856 persons allegedly held by the Armenians.
 c. Yorture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Torture is illegal; however, the police practice of beating prisoners during arrest and
 interrogation was widespread. Severe beatings were common in detention. Three
 persons died after being beaten while  e    custody (see Section .a.).
 On one occasion, police beat journalists (see Section 2.a.).
 Police also dispersed demonstrators by force (see Section 2.b.).
 Prison conditions are harsh. The quality of food, housing, and medical care is
 poor. Prisoners often must rely on their families to procure food and medicine. There
 are widesprea d    credible reports that authorities deny, or give inadequate, medi-
 cal treatment to prisoners with serious medical conditions. Authorities severely limit
 opportunities for exercise for prisoners in security prisons.
 The family of Kenan Gurel, who was convicted of participating in a coup attempt,
 reports that he continues to receive inadequate treatment for a kidney ailment.
 Human rights organizations were able to visit a prison on at least one occasion.
 The Government continued to deny the ICRC access to all prisons, except those
 where persons held in relation to the Nagrno-Karabakh conflict were detained.
 Various embassies have petitioned the Government for permission to visit all pris-
 ons. In general, when asked, the authorities grant foreign officials access to regular
 prisons to visit imprisoned nationals of their countries. However, the Government
 denies access to detainees held in security prisons.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile. Arbitrary arrests without legal warrant
 occur. Often authorities do not notify family members after arrests. Frequently, it
 is days before family members are able to obtain information as to whether authori-
 ties have arrested someone and where authorities are holding the detainee. Family
 members do not enjoy the right of visitation. Authorities generally deny bail to de-
 tained individuals and often do not inform detainees of the charges against them.
 There is no legal protection concerning the right of detainees to he charged or re-
 leased within a certain period of time, or for accused persons to receive an expedi-
 tious trial. Access to lawyers is often poor. In addition police sometimes arrest rel-
 atives of suspects being sought in an attempt to force the family to reveal a sus-
 pect's whereabouts.
 During the year, the police arrested at least 19 members of the opposition Azer-
 baijan Popular Front Party and held them for short periods. Another member of an
 opposition party was arrested and sentened to 10 years' imprisonment for illegal
 weapons possession and for forming an illegal armed group.
 Thme Government released former Prime inister Panakh Huseynov in Febroary,
 after detaining him for 9 months without charge. Also released in March was Azer-
 baijan Popular Front member Kemal Talibov, who was held for 6 months, allegedly
 for threatening state officials, and "ihooliganism."
 At least two persons, an aide to opposition leader Isa Gambar and his relative,
 are known to bedetained forpoiticl reasons; they were charged with failure to
 notify the Government of a crime, or possession of weapons.
 The Government does not practice forced exile.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial dThe Constitution provides for a judiciary with lim-
 ited independence. The President appoints Supreme and Constitutional Court
 judges, subject to confirmation by Parliament. The President directly appoints lower
 level judges with no requirement for confirmation. Constitutional provisions for judi-
 cial independence to the contrary, judges do not function independently of the execu-
 tive branch. The judicial system is subject to the influence of executive authorities
 and has been widely seen as corrupt and inefficient.
 Courts of general jurisdiction may hear criminal, civil, and juvenile cases. District
 and municipal courts try the overwhelming majority of cases. The Supreme Court
 may aso act as the court of first instance, depending on the nature and seriousness
 of the crime.
 The Government organizes prosecutors into offices at the district, municipal, and
 republic levels. They are ultimately responsible to the Minister of Justice, are ap-
 pointed by the President, and confirmed by Parliament. The Constitution prescribes
 equal status for prosecutors and defense attorneys before the courts. In practice,
 however, prosecutorial prerogatives still generally outweigh those of defense attor-
 neys. Investigations often rely on obtaining confessions rather than obtaining evi-
 dence against suspects.
 Cases at the district court level are tried before a panel consisting of one judge
 and two lay assessors. Judges frequently send cases unlikely to end in convictions
 back to the prosecutor for "additional investigation." Such cases may be either
 dropped or closed, occasionally without informing the court or the defendant.
 
 
 971
 The Constitution provides for public trials except in cases involving state, com-
 mercial, or professional secrets, or matters involving confidentiality of personal or
 family matters. The Constitution provides for the presumption of innocence in crimi-
 nal cases, and numerous other rights, including an exclusionary rule barring the use
 of illegally obtained evidence, a suspect's right to legal counsel, to be informed im-
 mediately of his legal rights, and of the charges against him. However, the Govern-
 ment has not made significant efforts to enforce these rights throughout the crimi-
 nal justice system. Defendants may confront witnesses and present evidence. The
 court appoints an attorney for indigent defendants. Defendants and prosecutors
 have the right of appeal. The Government has generally observed the constitutional
 provision for public trial. Foreign and domestic observers generally were able to at-
 tend trials. However, a trial of leaders of the Islamic party, which resulted in sen-
 tences of up to 12 years, was held without public observers.
 The Government held approximately 120 political prisoners at year's end.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution provides for secrecy of correspondence and telephone conversations,
 subject to limits provided by law in criminal investigations or in prevention of a
 crime. The Constitution allows searches of residences only with a court order or in
 cases provided by law. However, citizens widely believe that the Ministry of Na-
 tional Security monitors telephones, especially those of foreigners and prominent po-
 litical and business figures. Police often conduct searches without a warrant, and
 investigations sometimes resulted in confining the individuals to their city of resi-
 dence or a brief jail sentence for questioning. There were credible reports that police
 arrested relatives of suspects to compel them to reveal a suspect's whereabouts (see
 Section 1.d.).
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech
 and the press, and specifically outlaws press censorship; however, the Government
 often did not respect these rights in practice. The Government practiced censorship
 and created an atmosphere in which journalists exercised self-censorship. However,
 prominent politicians criticized the Government publicly without reprisal.
 While the press debated a wide variety of sensitive topics, censorship limited the
 public's ability to be informed about and discuss political issues. Most newspapers
 are printed in the Government's publishing house. They must submit their copy to
 a government censor. The Government's near monopoly of publishing facilities en-
 abled it to exert indirect pressure over the press by controlling the price of news-
 print, a critical matter given the precarious finances of most opposition newspapers.
 Censorship continued at approximately 1996 levels. Although in September the Gov-
 ernment officially abolished censorship of military topics, censorship of political top-
 ics continued. The Ministry of Information can legally close a newspaper for 1
 month for violating censorship rules. Censors deleted portions of newspaper articles
 or entire articles. Journalists often exercise self-censorship. Two ma or opposition
 newspapers claimed that 74 and 84 of their issues, respectively, had encountered
 censorship. The Government banned three issues of smaller opposition newspapers.
 In addition the Ministry of Information withdrew permission to publish from a
 newspaper after its first issue appeared, citing the newspaper's "opposition tend-
 enc'" and never granted it permission to publish. Police on one occasion in Septem-
 ber beat two journalists; one of them was hospitalized. At the end of the year, two
 journalists had been beaten; no investigation conducted into the beating of the jour-
 nalists. No journalists were detained or imprisoned. However, several journalists
 were prevented from visiting former president Elchibey (see Section 2.d.). Foreign
 journalist Irena Lasota, editor of a quarterly journal, was searched and questioned
 by armed forces personnel after interviewing former president Elchibey in July.
 The investigation of the 1996 beating of a journalist continued, but no charges
 were brought.
 Despite government censorship, the independent and opposition press continued
 to play an active, influential ro e in politics. Articles critical of government policy
 and high government fignres (with the exception of President Aiyev) appeare rou-
 tinely in the opposition and independent print media. Newspapers began to discuss
 censorship itself. Newspapers were able to publish articles opposing government
 views in sensitive areas such as Azerbaijan's relations with Russia and Iran and
 Nagorno-Karabakh peace negotiations. Newspapers also exposed government short-
 comings in economic reform, corruption in high government offices, and conflicts
 within the presidential administration and the P resident's political party.
 A large number of newspapers continued to publish. One reliable source put the
 number of repstered newspapers at 375, and the number actually publishing at
 nearly 100. These included independent newspapers and newspapers with links to
 
 
 972
 major and minor opposition parties. Government-run kiosks and independent news
 distributors distributed opposition and independent newspapers.
 The Government, however, tightly controlled most radio and television the source
 of information for most of the population. Opposition parties had virtually no access
 to the official electronic media. There is a limited range of -private television sta-
 tions, and some of them are accessible only to those local residents who own mod-
 ern, foreign-produced television sets. Independent radio, the choice of the over-
 whelming majority of listeners, is almost entirely entertainment oriented. Independ-
 ent televsion ant'radio broadcasters are reluctant to air controversial political top-
 ics due to fear of government retaliation.
 The Ministry of Justice continued to deny registration to nine independent tele-
 vision stations, five of which are kept from broadcasting. Eight independent tele-
 vision stations continue to operate in Baku and other regions. Several foreign tele-
 vision stations and radio programs are rebroadcast locally through Azerbaijani fa-
 cilities and are seen and heard in most parts of the country. There are no restric-
 tions on reception of foreign stations via satellite.
 Appointments to government-controlled academic positions are heavily dependent
 on political connections. Nevertheless, several professors with tenure are active in
 opposition parties. There were no complaints of violation of academic freedom or of
 censorship of books or academic journals.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 freedom of assembly; however, the Government restricts this right when it decides
 that it is in its interest to do so. The Government denied permission for several
 demonstrations by opposition parties in the capital. It dispersed demonstrations by
 force on at least two occasions.
 The Government cited no clear criteria when it denied permission to assemble.
 Authorities frequently prevent opposition political parties from conducting local con-
 gresses, meetings, and outdoor gatherings.
 The Government provides for freedom of association; however, the Government re-
 stricts this right when it decides that it is in its interest to do so. The Government
 requires political parties to register. There are nearly 40 registered political parties.
 Some of these are affiliated with or support the President's party. At least 10 reg-
 istered parties are considered opposition parties. There are at least two opposition
 parties that the Government continued to refuse to register. Members of the Azer-
 laijan Democratic Party, long unable to register, stage a hunger strike that lasted
 over 3 weeks to protest the Government's refusal to register it. The Supreme Court
 in December overruled the Ministry's refusal to register the party; however, at
 year's end, the Government had not officially registered the party.
 The Government generally allowed associations other than political parties to
 function freely. However, the Ministry of Justice requires private organizations to
 register. The Government did not grant this registration freely and expeditiously.
 It denied or unduly delayed registration for numerous private voluntary organiza-
 tions, including three private human rights organizations. Reports of harassment of
 political figures continued. There were credible reports of individuals linked to oppo-
 sition parties being fired from their jobs.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for no state religion and allows
 people of all faiths to practice their religion without restrictions. The Government
 respects this provision in practice for Shi'a and Sunni Muslims, Russian Orthodox
 Christians, and Jews. However, a law on foreigners and stateless persons contains
 language that prohibits religious "propaganda" by foreigners. This provision was re-
 inforced by a presidential decree in January. The law on religion subordinates all
 Islamic religious organizations to the Azerbaijan-based spiritual Directorate of
 Caucasus Muslims. This law permits the production, importation, and dissemination
 of religious literature only with the agreement of local government authorities. The
 Ministry of Justice ontinued to deny registration to a foreign Christian group, but
 allowed it to continue to function. Registration enables a religious organization to
 maintain a bank account legally, rent property, and generally to act as a legal en-
 tity. Lack of registration makes it harder, but not impossible, for a religious group
 to function. Non-Orthodox Christian groups crdibly complained of official harass-
 ment. Articles appeared sporadically in progovernment andindependent newspapers
 crudely depicting various religious groups, including some non-Orthodox Christian
 missionary groups, as a threat to national identity, traditions, and morals. The Gov-
 ernment arrested a member of the Baku community of Jehovah's Witnesses in No-
 vember and accused him of attempting to bribe a state official. Prosecutors ques-
 tioned other Jehovah's witnesses. Members of this community report that an official
 in the Baku city prosecutor's office struck two of these persons during questioning;
 one of them sustained injuries. The official was subsequently removed from the case.
 Because of anti-Armenian sentiment and the forced departure of most of the Arme-
 
 
 973
 nian population, Armenian churches remained closed. Azerbaijan's Jewish commu-
 nity has freedom to worship and conduct educational activities.
 There is some evidence of strong prejudice against ethnic Azerbaijanis who have
 converted to Christianity. A Christian Azerbajani was detained after being as-
 saulted by another Azerbaijani while he was engaging in religious conversation in
 a public park. He was taken to a police station, beaten, and sentenced by a judge
 to 2 weeks in jail.
 Government bias against foreign missionary groups persists. In June the Govern-
 ment published a booklet with alarmist warnings against foreign missionaries, list-
 ing names and addresses of missionary offices in Azerbaijan. The book cover depicts
 a cross symbol and a dagger in the heart of a map of Azerbaijan.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Constitution provides for the right of citizens to choose freely their
 place of domicile and to travel abroad and return. Residents of border areas in both
 Azerbaijan and Iran travel across the border in this restricted zone without visas.
 Foreigners and citizens require a visa to travel to the Autonomous Republic of
 Nakhchivan. There were reports that local officials denied passports to members of
 the Armenian minority (see Section 5).
 There continue to be bans on travel outside of Baku or outside the country on
 some prominent political leaders who are under criminal investigation. Two opposi-
 tion party leaders remain under such restrictions: Isa Gambar (charged with using
 military force in the context of a rebellion leading to the overthrow of the Elchibey
 government in 1993); and Suiheddin Akper, under investigation for his role in the
 Popular Front government of 1992-93. Both were prevented several times from ac-
 cepting invitations to travel abroad and did not travel outside the country this year.
 For 2 months, police restricted access to the village where former President Elchibey
 resided, and prevented several journalists and Members of Parliament from travel-
 ing there and meeting him. In October Elchibey was allowed to return to Baku,
 where he resumed full political activity.
 The Government officially recognizes freedom of emigration. Jewish emigration to
 Israel is unrestricted. However, with the majority of those who wish to emigrate al-
 ready having left, the number of Jewish emigrants is now small. The remaining Ar-
 menankpopulation in Azerbaijan (other than Armenians residing in the Nagorno-
 Karaba    region of Azerbaijan) is approximately 10,000 to 20,000, mostly persons
 of mixed descent or in mixed marriages. While official government policy is that Ar-
 menians are free to travel, low-level officials seeking bribes have harassed Arme-
 nians wishing to emigrate.
 There were no draft notifications that restricted movement during the year. Draft-
 age men must obtain documents from military officials before they can leave for
 international travel.
 The number of refugees and internally displaced persons is approximately
 780,000. Armenians have settled in parts of the occupied territories. However, the
 Armenians have not allowed the hundreds of thousands of Azerbaijanis who were
 forced out of the now-occupied territories to return to their homes. Most of these
 internally displaced persons continue to live in camps and other temporary shelters,
 often at below-subsistence levels, without adequate food, housing, education, or med-
 ical care. The parties to the conflict have cut normal trade and transportation links
 to the other side, causing severe hardship to civilians in Nagorno-Karabakh, Arme-
 nia, and the Azerbaijani exclave of Nakhchivan.
 The Constitution provides for political asylum consistent with international
 norms. The Government is receptive to international assistance for refugees and in-
 ternally displaced persons. It cooperates with international organizations to provide
 aid for them. The Government cooperates with the office of the United Nations High
 Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and other humanitarian organizations in as-
 sisting refugees. The issue of the provision of first asylum did not arise. There were
 no reports of forced expulsion of those having a valid claim to refugee status. Two
 Iraqi refugees ordered by the Government in 1996 to leave the country remain while
 awaiting refugee processing to travel to a third country.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 In theory the election law and Constitution allow citizens to change their govern-
 ment by peaceful means. However, government interference in past elections re-
 stricted citizens' ability to change their government peacefully.
 Azerbaijan is a republic with a strong presidency, and a legislature that the Con-
 stitution describes as independent. As a result of the flawed 1995 parliamentary
 elections, however, the New Azerbaijan party led by President Aliyev and other par-
 ties and nominally independent deputies loyal to the President occupy the over-
 
 
 whelming majority of seats in the 125-member Parliament. Parties considering
 themselves as belonging to the opposition hold eight seats. Opposition parties con-
 tinued to be active outside the Parliament, agitating for their views in their news-
 papers and through public statements. However, the Government continued to deny
 registration to at least two opposition parties not represented in Parliament (see
 Section 2.b.). Explicitly ethnically or religiously based parties were prohibited from
 participating in past elections.
 In practice the legislature's independence from the executive is marginal. The
 Parliament exercises little legislative initiative independent of the executive.
 Following Rasul Guliyev's forced resignation as Speaker of Parliament in 1996
 and reports in December that he would run for president in 1998, the Parliament
 stripped him of his mandate as a Member of Parliament.
 The Constitution, adopted in 1995, required the formulation of a municipal elec-
 tion law and the holding of municipal elections by November 1997. As of year's end,
 such a law had not been passed and elections were not held by the constitutionally
 mandated date.
 The Constitution allows citizens to file court proceedings to challenge illegal ac-
 tions of government officials. However, citizens rarely made use of this provision,
 preferring to appeal to higher levels of authority, up to and including the human
 rights committee of the legislature, and the President.
 There are no legal restrictions on women's participation in politics. However, tra-
 ditional social norms restrict women's roles in politics. Men cast the votes of their
 wives and other female members of their families in past elections. There are 11
 female members of Parliament and 2 women with ministerial rank.
 There are no restrictions on the participation of minorities in politics as individ-
 uals. However, explicitly ethnically or religiously based parties were prohibited from
 participating in past elections. Members of indigenous ethnic minorities such as
 Talysh, Lezghis, and Kurds occupy some senior government positions.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Several human rights organizations monitor the human rights situation in the
 country. For the most part, the Government posed no objections to international
 human rights groups. Some of these groups investigate human rights abuses and
 disseminate their findings through the media. The Government, however, has been
 critical of certain domestic human rights activists who have raised politically sen-
 sitive issues. Eighteen local women's groups are active.
 The Government has demonstrated a limited willingness to discuss human rights
 problems with international government and nongovernmental organizations
 (NGO's). The Ministry of Justice allowed representatives of local NGO human rights
 organizations to visit a prison. The ICRC has had access to prisoners of war as well
 as civilians held in relation to the conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh. However, the
 ICRC has requested and been denied access to prisoners not related to the Nagorno-
 Karabakh conflict being held in special security and other prisons.
 Ministry of Interior officials conducted discussions with the Azerbaijani National
 Committee of the Helsinki Citizens Assembly on human rights violations by police
 and mistreatment of detainees. However, when that organization's representative
 complained about the country's treatment of ethnic Armenians, the Government's
 political party launched a press campaign against her, accusing her of cooperation
 with foreign intelligence services. In addition government newspapers published ar-
 ticles accusing the chairman of another human rights organization of cooperation
 with foreign intelligence organizations. In a November speech, President Aliyev ac-
 cused domestic human rights advocates of spreading lies and rumors and of cooper-
 ating with foreign special services. In the same speech, he included conciliatory re-
 marks toward opposition parties. The Ministry of Justice continued to deny registra-
 tion to several human rights groups, but the Government has not tried to halt their
 activities. Registration enables a human rights organization to maintain a bank ac-
 count legally, rent property, and generally to act as a legal entity. Lack of registra-
 tion makes it harder, but not impossible, for a human rights group to function.
 The ICRC conducted education programs on international humanitarian law for
 officials of the Ministries of Interior and Defense, and for university and secondary
 school students. Government officials participated in UNHCR-organized training
 sessions aimed at reforming the Law on Refugees and Displaced Persons.
 A local NGO published a monthly bulletin listing cases of human rights violations
 taken from the press.

 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution provides for equal rights without respective for gender, race, na-
 tionality or national origin, religion, language, social status, or membership in polit-
 ical parties, trade unions, or other public organizations. However, in the wake of the
 Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, there is widespread anti-Armenian sentiment in society.
 Preventing discrimination is not a major government priority.
 Women.-Discussion of violence against women is a taboo subject in Azerbaijan's
 patriarchal society. In rural areas, women have no real recourse against violence by
 their husbands, regardless of the law. Rape is severely punishable, but, especially
 in rural areas, only a small fraction of offenses against women are reported or pros-
 ecuted. Police statistics note 44 cases of rape in the first 8 months of the year. These
 figures probably reflect underreporting, especially from the conservative rural areas.
 There are no specific laws concerning spousal abuse or spousal rape.
 Women nominally enjoy the same legal rights as men, including the right to par-
 ticipate in all aspects of economic and social life. In general women have extensive
 opportunities for education and work. However, traditional social norms continue to
 restrict women's roles in the economy. Representation of women is sharply lower in
 higher levels of the work force. There are few women in executive positions in lead-
 ing economic enterprises.
 The Association for the Defense of Rights of Azerbaijani Women spends most of
 its time fighting uniquely post-Soviet problems. It has helped divorced women, wid-
 ows, and wives whose husbands are in prison, all of whom have become socially and
 legally vulnerable since the fall of the Soviet Union. It assisted widows whose land-
 lords privatized their apartments and then evicted them. It also worked with di-
 vorced women who feel unfairly treated by divorce courts.
 Children.-The Constitution and laws commit the Government to protecting the
 rights of children to education and health. Difficult economic circumstances limit the
 Government's ability to carry out these commitments. Education is compulsory until
 age 17. The Constitution places children's rights on the same footing as those of
 adults. The Criminal Code prescribes severe penalties for crimes against children.
 The Government provides minimum standards of health care for children, although
 the quality of medical care overall has fallen dramatically since the collapse of the
 Soviet Union. The Government has authorized subsidies for children in an attempt
 to shield families against economic hardship in the wake of price liberalization. The
 subsidies do not come close to covering the shortfall in family budgets, and the Gov-
 ernment does not have the financial means to meet its commitments. There are a
 large number of refugee and displaced children living in substandard conditions in
 refugee camps and public buildings. Children beg on the streets of Baku and other
 towns.
 People With Disabilities.-The law on support for the disabled, enacted in 1993,
 prescribes priority for invalids and the disabled in obtaining housing, as well as dis-
 counts for public transport, and pension supplements. The Government does not
 have the means in its current financial crisis to fulfill its commitments. There are
 no special provisions in the law mandating accessibility to buildings for the dis-
 abled.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-The outbreak of hostilities and anti-Arme-
 nian riots in the final years of the Soviet Union led to the expulsion of many Arme-
 nians and the departure of others. An estimated 10,000 to 20,000 Armenians still
 live in Azerbaijan, mostly in mixed Azerbaijani-Armenian families. Some have
 changed their nationality, as reported in their passports, to Azerbaijani. With the
 nearly complete departure of the Armenian population, the number of problems re-
 p orted by this ethnic minority has decreased. The leader of a local human rights
 GO complained of officially sponsored discrimination against Armenians (see Sec-
 tion 4). Armenians have complained of discrimination in employment and harass-
 ment at schools and workplaces, and of refusal of local government authorities to
 grant Armenians passports or pay pensions. Armenian widows have had permits to
 live in Baku revoked. However, some persons of mixed Armenian-Azerbaijani de-
 scent continue to occupy government positions.
 Indigenous ethnic minorities such as the Talysh, Lezghis, Avars, and Georgians
 do not suffer discrimination. However, Meskhetian Turks displaced from Central
 Asia as well as Kurdish displaced persons from the Lachin region complain of dis-
 crimination.
 In the area of the country controlled by insurgent (Armenian) forces, the Arme-
 nians forced approximately 550,000 ethnic Azerbaijanis to flee their homes. The re-
 gime that now controls these areas has effectively banned ethnic Azerbaijanis from
 all spheres of civil, political, and economic life.

 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Most labor unions still operate as they did under the
 Soviet system and remain tightly linked to the Government..The Constitution pro-
 vides for freedom of association, including the right to form labor unions. However,
 one or another subbranch of the government-run Azerbaijani Labor Federation orga-
 nizes most industrial and white-collar workers. Most major industries remain state-
 owned.
 Furthermore, the Government undermined the sole significant independent labor
 union, the Free Trade Union of Azerbaijan Oil and Gas Industry Employees. In May
 management officials of the State Oil Company of the Azerbaijan Republic (SOCAR)
 formed a new, progovernment union, the Azerbaijan Oil and Gas Industry Workers
 Trade Union. The new union installed a senior SOCAR manager as its chairman,
 enrolled most subbranches of the old union in its ranks without a vote of the rank
 and file, and took over the headquarters of the free trade union. An independent
 group of oil workers, the Committee to Defend the Rights of Azerbaijani Oil Work-
 ers, operates outside established trade union structures and promotes the interests
 of workers in the petroleum sector.
 The Constitution provides for the right to strike, and there are no legal restric-
 tions on strikes nor provisions for retribution against strikers. After a history of
 wildcat strikes in the oil industry in which some striking workers were fired, there
 were no reported strikes in that sector during the year. Oil workers continue to de-
 mand restoration of wage arrears amounting to several months pay. Employers did
 not meet assurances to restore back pay. There are no established mechanisms to
 avoid wildcat strikes.
 Unions are free to form federations and to affiliate with international bodies, how-
 ever, none has done so.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-There is effectively no system
 of collective bargaining. Government-appointed boards and directors run the major
 enterprises and set wages. Unions do not participate in determining wage levels. In
 a carryover from the Soviet system, both management and workers are considered
 members of the professional unions.
 There are no export processing zones. Although there has been a United Nations
 Development Program-supported effort underway to create an economic zone in
 Sumgait since 1995, Parliament has not considered legislation to create such a zone.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Constitution allows forced or
 compulsory labor only under states of emergency or martial law, or as the result
 of a court decision affecting a condemned person. The Government has not invoked
 this clause. Two departments in the General Prosecutors Office (the Department of
 Implementation of the Labor Code and the Department for Enforcement of the Law
 on Minors) enforce the prohibition on forced or compulsory labor. There are no con-
 stitutional provision or law specifically prohibiting forced and bonded labor by chil-
 dren, but such practices are not known to occur. There were no reports this year
 of compulsory cotton picking by children or adults.
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment.-The Gov-
 ernment does not specifically prohibit forced and bonded labor by children, but such
 practices are not known to occur (see Section 6.c.). The minimum employment age
 is 16 years. Primary school education is compulsory free, and universal. Children
 are normally in school until the age of 17. The law allows children of age 14 to work
 during vacations with the consent of their parents and certification of a physician.
 Children of age 15 may work if the workplace's labor union does not object. There
 is no explicit restriction on the kinds of labor that children of age 15 may perform
 with union consent. The Labor and Social Security Ministry has primary enforce-
 ment responsibility for child labor laws. With high adult unemployment, there have
 been few, if any, complaints of abuses of child labor laws.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The Government sets the nationwide adminis-
 trative minimum wage by decree. It is $1.40 (5,500 manat) per month. The wage
 is not sufficient to provide a decent standard of living for a worker and family. The
 recommended monthly wage level to meet basic subsistence needs was estimated to
 be $78 (310,000 manat). There seems to be no active mechanism to enforce the mini-
 mum wage. However, since most people who work earn more than the minimum
 wage, its low level is not a major issue in labor or political debate.
 The disruption of economic links with the rest of the former Soviet Union contin-
 ues to affect employment in many industries. Idle factory workers typically receive
 less than half of their former wage. Under these conditions, many workers rely on
 the safety net of the extended family. More workers and unemployed persons turn
 to second jobs and makeshift employment in the informal sector, such as operating
 the family car as a taxi, selling produce from private gardens, or operating small
 
 
 roadside shops. Combinations of these and other strategies are.the only way for
 broad sectors of the urban population to reach a subsistence income level.
 The legal workweek is 41 hours. There is a 1-hour lunch break per day and short-
 er breaks in the morning and afternoon. The Government does not enforce these
 rules in the informal sector.
 Health and safety standards exist, but they are usually ignored in the workplace.
 Workers cannot leave dangerous work conditions without fear of losing their jobs.
