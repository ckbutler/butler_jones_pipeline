 YUGOSLAVIA
 The Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia is a
 multinational, federal state comprising six republics, one of
 which has two autonomous provinces. The League of Communists
 of Yugoslavia (Communist party), maintains a monopoly on
 political power. The ideology of Yugoslav communism and
 socialist self-management differs substantially from the
 highly centralized and rigid Soviet model of Communist rule.
 In the Yugoslav political system, the party is decentralized
 so that the republic and provincial party authorities wield
 power that is seldom challenged by the central party
 bureaucracy. In the economic system, socialist
 self-management theoretically and legally provides that the
 workers run their own enterprises. It also permits extensive,
 private, small-scale farming and some private enterprises in
 services.
 Although the fundamental tenets of socialist self-management
 and the federal structure of the state are among the taboos
 which cannot be questioned, there is relatively open debate
 within and outside the League of Communists on the
 implementation of these concepts. Key topics frequently
 discussed in the open include the boundaries of permissible
 political and cultural expression, economic reform, and the
 functioning of the political system. Some issues, however,
 like the rights of and the relations among ethnic groups,
 appear to be so sensitive that free speech is not tolerated.
 The multiethnic composition of the population and the tragic
 internecine strife between Croats and Serbs during World War II
 have made Yugoslav leaders wary of separatist sentiment. The
 late President Tito and successive Yugoslav governments have
 taken stern measures to repress display of *nationalism.'
 In this framework the Yugoslav human rights situation in 1984
 was marred by several negative developments. Harassment,
 arrests, and indictments increased for verbal and other
 expressions of *nationalism,* a pejorative term implying
 loyalty to one's own ethnic group to the detriment of other
 ethnic groups and the Yugoslav multiethnic community. Some
 Yugoslavs participating in a private academic seminar on
 ethnic relations were arrested and indicted on political
 charges. One has so far been convicted, and one died
 mysteriously. Continuing Serb-Albanian antagonism in the
 Autonomous Province of the Kosovo has led to killings and
 rapes. Some professors who were suspected of propagating
 Albanian "nationalism' were dismissed from their positions.
 Overall, the number of political prisoners has apparently
 increased, especially in the Kosovo.
 In recent years, Yugoslavia has been hard hit by a series of
 economic difficulties, including massive foreign debt, high
 inflation, rising unemployment, and declining living
 standards. Clashes of political and economic interests have
 impeded resolution of these difficulties.

 YUGOSLAVIA
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 A worker named Radomir Radovic, one of a group of 28 Yugoslavs
 detained on April 20 while participating in a private academic
 seminar in Belgrade on ethnic relations, was later found dead
 under mysterious circumstances several days after being
 questioned by local police. Although a coroner's report
 subsequently ruled his death a suicide, serious questions
 remain about its cause. Some activists believe that there was
 direct or indirect police complicity in Radovic's death.
 The Autonomous Province of the Kosovo, which is predominantly
 ethnic Albanian, continues to be troubled by ethnic tension
 and occasional violent political acts. The tension stems from
 deep-rooted ethnic Serb-Albanian antagonism, compounded by
 what many Albanians claim is discrimination by ethnic Serb
 authorities in Belgrade. Deaths related to that tension
 occasionally occur in the Kosovo. Killings or, more recently,
 rapes of ethnic Serbs by ethnic Albanians are usually reported
 in the Belgrade media as motivated by nationalism. Official
 toleration of killings of ethnic Albanians by Serbs or other
 non-Albanian Yugoslav officials are occasionally alleged by
 emigre ethnic Albanian groups, but no proof has been
 established with respect to these allegations.
 During the past few years, according to reports in the Western
 press, Yugoslav intelligence services have been responsible
 for murders in Western Europe of key members of opposition
 emigre organizations. Some of these groups have engaged in
 terrorist activities against Yugoslav embassies and other
 establishments in the West.
 b. Disappearance
 No instances of permanent or prolonged disappearance of
 persons inside Yugoslavia were reported in 1984. In the past,
 the Yugoslav intelligence services have allegedly kidnapped
 prominent Yugoslav emigres in order to return them to
 Yugoslavia for trial.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Although Yugoslav law and the Constitution forbid torture,
 various sources, including Amnesty International, have
 reported allegations that people have been beaten, tortured,
 or threatened during pretrial detention or, more rarely, while
 serving sentences. Police officials are periodically
 reprimanded or suspended for illegal use of force, and the
 local press reports such incidents. Allegations have been
 made of the misuse of psychiatry in political cases, and the
 Yugoslav press this year published one such instance.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 'Political crime" in Yugoslavia, as defined by the Yugoslav
 Criminal Code, consists of attempts to overthrow the
 
 
 1149
 YUGOSLAVIA
 constitutional order or attacks on the country's territorial
 integrity and basic constitutional values. The definition of
 political crime includes a number of broad, imprecise
 categories, such as "counterrevolutionary attacks,'
 "endangering the independence of the state," "association for
 (the purpose of) hostile activity," and "hostile propaganda."
 Laws against such activities are applied far more strictly in
 some parts of the country than in others, and usually with far
 greater severity in cases of "nationalism" than in cases
 involving other forms of political criticism. Arrests on
 charges relating to "nationalism" have been especially
 numerous among ethnic Albanians in the Kosovo. Arrests on
 "hostile propaganda" charges have included citations for
 participating in demonstrations at which speakers advocated
 full republic status for the Kosovo, passing out leaflets,
 singing 'nationalist" songs, and writing "nationalist" slogans
 in public places.
 Political cases are usually reported in the press. Pretrial
 confinement in political cases does not always occur: for
 example, six Belgrade intellectuals indicted for political
 offenses, although initially placed under arrest, were
 subsequently released from prison, remained at liberty
 throughout the period leading up to their trial, and
 participated actively in preparation of their defense.
 Yugoslav legal procedures, which derive from Napoleonic law,
 are generally followed in all, including political, cases:
 arrests are conducted pursuant to warrants; defendants are
 brought before a judge within 24 hours of arrest; individuals
 arrested for political reasons are openly charged with
 violating specific sections of the Criminal Code dealing with
 political crimes (not accused of ordinary crimes or of treason
 or espionage); and defendants have the right to independent
 counsel.
 The Yugoslav Criminal Code allows the arrest and imprisonment
 of Yugoslav citizens for acts considered under Yugoslav law to
 be political offenses, even though they were committed abroad
 and were not crimes in the country in which they took place.
 In the past year, such cases have involved Yugoslav dual
 nationals or guest workers resident in the United States, the
 Federal Republic of Germany, and Switzerland.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Although ordinary criminal trials are almost always open to
 the public,, not all political trials are. Yugoslav political
 authorities usually do not remain impartial in judicial
 proceedings concerning political cases. Substantial evidence
 exists that Federal, republic, and provincial political
 authorities have sought in some cases to. orchestrate trials of
 those charged with political crimes. Human rights
 organizations believe that the outcome in political cases is
 determined before the trial takes place. Others, including
 some critics of the Government, hold that the courts have
 considerable independence, particularly in determining length
 and type of sentences, if not innocence or guilt. Amnesty
 International has reported the reluctance of some defense
 lawyers to take some political cases for fear of pressure.
 The six accused Belgrade intellectuals and a Sarajevo
 sociologist, Vojislav Seselj, convicted in 1984 on a political
 
 
 1150
 YUGOSLAVIA
 charge, found energetic and independent attorneys. However,
 in their trials, the first choice of defense counsel for
 several defendants was prevented by the authorities from
 acting on their behalf when the prosecution listed him as a
 prosecution witness. Many believe the real purpose of this
 action was to prevent his acting for the accused.
 The Yugoslav public prosecutor is required by law to give a
 public report to the Federal Assembly (Parliament) on the
 annual number of indictments for political offenses. The
 total number of persons currently incarcerated in Yugoslavia
 for political offenses is very difficult to determine.
 Official figures are frequently contradictory and difficult to
 obtain, but according to official statistics for 1983 the
 number of persons sentenced for political crimes in that year
 appeared to have risen by about 7 percent. Political crimes
 actually increased during that year in only the republics of
 Bosnia-Hercegovina and Montenegro. In 1984 the number of
 indictments and convictions for political offenses rose
 substantially in the Autonomous Province of the Kosovo and in
 Seroia. In the Kosovo, there were 132 convictions for
 political offenses in the first 6 months of 1984, as opposed
 to a total of 176 in all of 1983, according to a report
 published in an authoritative Belgrade news weekly. In
 addition, several trials of alleged "irredentists" were held
 following publication of the report. The report also stated
 that by the end of June 1984, 585 ethnic Albanians had been
 sentenced on political charges since the beginning of the
 Albanian nationalist disturbances in the Kosovo in March
 1981. At present, there are probably 450-500 political
 prisoners in the Kosovo. In Croatia, according to local
 authorities, there were 61 individuals serving time for
 political offenses as of September 21, 1984, 6 fewer than in
 September 1983. Countrywide, the number of political
 prisoners may be estimated at between 600 and 750, an increase
 of perhaps 100 over 1983.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Yugoslav authorities are widely alleged to interfere in the
 private lives of citizens. Although the judicial system
 provides elaborate and generally effective safeguards
 concerning procedures for conducting searches, many Yugoslavs
 believe that the authorities eavesdrop on conversations, read
 mail, and tap telephones.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Although there have been some setbacks during the past year
 with respect to freedom of speech, there is a slow, widely
 acknowledged trend toward greater openness and media freedom.
 Nevertheless, police authorities seized and briefly detained
 28 Yugoslavs, including former Vice President Milovan Djilas,
 who were holding a private academic seminar in Belgrade on
 ethnic relations. One of the detainees, Sarajevo sociologist
 Vojislav Seselj, was tried and convicted on a political charge
 and sentenced to 8 years in prison (subsequently reduced on
 appeal to 4 years). Six others, of whom four were members of
 the group, were indicted for political offenses. Their trial
 
 
 1151
 YUGOSLAVIA
 began on November 5. The police raid was inconsistent with
 official toleration of such seminars which not only had been
 held in Belgrade since 1975 but also were resumed without
 incident after the raid.
 Derogatory ethnic comments which the Government considers
 incendiary are punished when brought to the attention of the
 authorities. Proscribed verbal statements and other forms of
 personal expression (e.g., painting hostile slogans) are
 grounds for prosecution, especially in cases of 'nationalist"
 expression. The Government distinguishes between private
 verbal statements, of which it is more tolerant, and public
 ones, such as singing 'nationalist' songs or distributing
 "nationalist' literature.
 The Government gives considerable latitude to what it
 considers non-nationalist verbal statements of disagreement
 with government policy, except on a limited and declining
 number of 'taboo" themes, such as the personality of the late
 President Tito, the accepted version of the Yugoslav
 experience in World War II, and the basic socialist and
 nonaligned foreign policy orientation of the state.
 Apart from religious publications, Yugoslav media are given
 direction by the party or Government. Some newspaper
 publishing houses, however, enjoy a degree of autonomy which
 has increased markedly in recent years. On domestic issues,
 press criticism of specific government policies is frequent
 and growing. This extends to criticisms of overall policies
 and even the competence of the Cabinet. Criticism of the
 State Presidency is rarer. In 1984, the press often
 criticized the League of Communists for indecision and weak or
 divided leadership.
 Although there is no official prepublication censorship in
 Yugoslavia, the print media's independence is circumscribed by
 the oversight exercised (in theory, indirectly) by the
 authorities. The media exercise considerable self-censorship
 but at the same time are moving to expand the boundaries of
 the permissible. This process often leads to clashes with the
 authorities. For example, in the summer of 1984, an 80-page
 special issue of Knjizevna Rec, a Serbian youth literary
 biweekly, ran a series of articles directly attacking
 repression of political expression in Yugoslavia. The series
 was particularly critical of a Croatian party document (the
 so-called 'White Book*), issued in May, which attacked
 "liberalism* in culture and named over 200 eminent (mostly
 Serb and Slovene) writers and cultural figures. Knjizevna Rec
 was extensively criticized: its editor, who was due to depart
 in any event, was removed and later dismissed from the party.
 The former editor is currently at work in a research
 institute, and no further action has been taken against him.
 In the publishing of books, restraints are usually exercised
 by publishing house boards, which are subject to loose
 oversight. A wide range of critical and political books by
 Yugoslav and foreign authors has been published. For example,
 Orwell's "1984" has become a best seller in a reissued
 paperback translation. Occasionally books are published and
 later recalled. For example, in 1984, a book on the 1968
 student demonstrations in Belgrade was banned after its
 release. Its author then criticized the authorities' action
 
 
 1152
 YUGOSLAVIA
 in public print, but the book remained banned. Sometimes,
 books banned from circulation in one republic become best
 sellers in another. There is some private publishing in
 Yugoslavia, although official attitudes toward it vary from
 republic to republic.
 The authorities continue to apply pressure on professors at
 the Kosovo's Pristina University, going so far as to expel
 some who are suspected of propagating Albanian 'nationalism'
 or who are accused of failing to oppose it. On the other
 hand, members of the "Praxis" Group at Belgrade University,
 although not allowed to teach, continue to work, publish, and
 read public papers concerning domestic politics, philosophy,
 and social theory. In some politically related fields, such
 as economics, the situation varies. Frank, published
 criticism of the Government's economic policies by prominent
 economic writers is common practice, and on occasion their
 advice and counsel is sought by government officials. Authors
 free from official intervention in one republic may be subject
 to informal pressures in another.
 Western newspapers, books, and periodicals are openly
 available in Yugoslavia, although their numbers are currently
 restricted by hard currency shortages. Individual issues of
 Western magazines or newspapers may be censored or forbidden
 entry into the country when judged by authorities to be
 offensive, but this practice is rare. However, some
 publications by Yugoslav emigre groups are considered hostile
 propaganda, and possession of them may be grounds for criminal
 prosecution. In 1984, the authorities arrested three priests
 for distributing a proscribed emigre magazine which, according
 to the Government, calls for the destruction of the political
 system and incites hatred among ethnic groups. Two priests
 were convicted and sentenced to 14 and 10 months in jail,
 while the third was set free.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Public political demonstrations are permitted only by official
 organizations and, generally, only in support of government
 policy; others usually are suppressed. However, some
 semi-public independent gatherings are tolerated. Regular
 meetings of the Serbian Philosophy Society, critical of the
 authorities' handling of dissidents as well as domestic
 policy, have taken place and continue to be tolerated. The
 Slovenian Philosophic and Sociological societies have
 sponsored meetings at Ljubljana University to discuss the
 cases of convicted Sarajevo sociologist Vojislav Seselj and
 the six indicted Belgrade intellectuals.
 On November 13, 19 prominent Belgrade intellectuals announced
 formation of a *committee for the defense of free thought and
 expression' to protest the trial of the Belgrade Six.
 Although the group has been denounced in the press, to date no
 overt actions have been taken against its members.
 Trade unions, organized geographically by republic and
 province, form part of the Yugoslav governmental system. They
 are no longer solely 'transmission belts' of authority and
 control. Union leaders increasingly play a significant role
 within the political system in advocacy of workers' interests
 on such matters as the impact of inflation and wage policy.
 
 
 1153
 YUGOSLAVIA
 Strikes, often referred to as "work stoppages,' are not
 prohibited by law and occur frequently, usually for local
 reasons. The longest work stoppage in postwar Yugoslav
 history--the 45-day sit-down strike at Macedonia's Idnina
 plant in 1984--was resolved through compromise. Union leaders
 usually attempt to mediate between workers and management in
 cases of strikes or threatened strikes.
 Professional groups, such as scientific bodies and lawyers'
 associations, maintain regular ties with their counterparts in
 recognized international bodies. The degree of application of
 political criteria for employment, virtually absolute
 immediately after World War II, has now diminished.
 Nevertheless, "moral-social" (i.e., political) criteria, are
 still actively applied for some employment, especially for
 government positions. Party membership, furthermore, is a
 virtual necessity for advancement in government, academia, and
 management positions in the economy.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Yugoslavia is a multireligious state. Most Yugoslav believers
 are members of the Roman Catholic Church, of the Serbian or
 Macedonian Orthodox Churches, or of the Islamic faith. Since
 World War II, the religiously observant Jewish community has
 numbered only several thousand persons. There is no official
 or favored religion: the Government officially encourages
 atheism. Freedom to practice religion is guaranteed under
 Yugoslav law, but proselytizing is outlawed. Religious
 communities have their own publications sold by subscription,
 although not at public kiosks. They maintain contacts with
 coreligionists abroad; Yugoslav Muslims go to Egypt or Saudi
 Arabia to study or on pilgrimages, Catholics have close
 contacts With Rome, and Jews maintain active ties to the world
 Jewish community and to Israel.
 Conflicts between the state and Yugoslav religious communities
 develop when the latter attempt to engage in activities that
 tne authorities consider 'nationalist' or political or, on the
 local level, over matters such as church building or social
 services, especially youth activities. The authorities regard
 ties between Yugoslav Muslims and Islamic fundamentalist
 groups with suspicion. They regularly criticize Catholic
 Church organizations in Yugoslavia for alleged support of
 Croatian nationalism and political activism. The authorities
 have also criticized the Serbian Orthodox Church, less
 intensely, for Serbian nationalism. They occasionally charge
 individual priests and Muslim imams with political offenses,
 usually related to 'nationalism.'
 The Government discriminates against actively practicing
 religious believers of all faiths; for example, a party member
 who baptizes his children risks expulsion from the party.
 This restriction has been criticized by the press and by some
 party officials. However, occasional attendance at services,
 such as on major holy days, usually causes no problems.
 Proselytizing activities and religious instruction of children
 are constrained, but restrictions vary from region to region.
 All three major faiths make vigorous efforts to provide
 religious instruction to youth. The Muslims are very active
 in Bosnia and Western Macedonia, as are Catholic priests at
 Croatian universities and the Orthodox Church in parts of
 
 
 1154
 YUGOSLAVIA
 Serbia. The building of new churches and mosques requires
 government permission. Permits to build some especially
 meaningful and symbolic churches, such as a new Serbian
 Orthodox St. Sava Church in Belgrade, have not been
 forthcoming, because the authorities maintain that they would
 represent more 'nationalist' than religious symbols. Muslims,
 however, have succeeded in erecting or renovating many mosques
 in Bosnia in recent years.
 In September 1984, the authorities permitted a Roman Catholic
 eucharistic gathering in Marija Bistrica, near Zagreb, which
 attracted crowds estimated at between 150,000 and 400,000
 people. This event probably represented the largest
 nonofficial gathering in Yugoslavia since 1945. Furthermore,
 the Yugoslav authorities since 1981 have tolerated pilgrimages
 by domestic and foreign Catholics to the village of Medjugorje
 (in Bosnia-Hercegovina) where the Virgin Mary reportedly has
 appeared to several small children. Catholic Church officials
 estimate that approximately two and a half million visitors
 have come to Medjugorje in the past 3 years.
 d. Freedom of Movement within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Almost all Yugoslavs are able to emigrate, seek temporary
 employment abroad, or visit foreign countries at will. Half
 of the country's population possesses valid passports, and no
 exit permits are required to visit the more than 135 countries
 with which Yugoslavia has diplomatic or consular relations.
 Yugoslav Jews (and many non-Jews) freely visit Israel, with
 which Yugoslavia has no diplomatic relations. Some Yugoslavs
 are denied passports on national security or political
 grounds. In July 1982, the Yugoslav media reported that a
 total of 26,000 passports had been denied in the postwar
 period, mostly to people with political criminal records.
 Over 600,000 Yugoslav workers, some with family members, are
 currently employed as 'guest workers" in Western Europe.
 Freedom of movement within the country is gua-ranteed by the
 Constitution and permitted in practice. However, many ethnic
 Serbs believe that the out-migration of ethnic Serbs from the
 predominantly ethnic Albanian Kosovo Province is the result of
 anti-Serbian behavior on the part of ethnic Albanians
 (including personal threats or occasional violent acts, forced
 sale of property, or vandalism).
 The law on the entrance of foreigners to Yugoslavia notes the
 right of permanent asylum and provides for government
 assistance to persons granted that right. In addition,
 Yugoslavia extends temporary asylum to refugees who, with the
 assistance of the Belgrade office of the United Nations High
 Commissioner for Refugees, seek permanent resettlement in
 third countries. At present, there are about 1,400 refugees
 temporarily in Yugoslavia. Cases of forcible repatriation of
 a refugee to his home country are infrequent;  in 1984, a
 group of 10 refugees was repatriated to Romania, allegedly
 because of disciplinary problems.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 The 2 million-member League of Communists of Yugoslavia
 
 
 1155
 YUGOSLAVIA
 maintains a monopoly on political power, but that authority is
 dispersed because the party is decentralized to the level of
 the six republics and two provinces. Yugoslav politicians and
 tne press regularly note that the country's eight regional
 party organizations hold widely differing views on key policy
 issues. Recently, the party Central Committee held a plenary
 debate, at which differences were openly aired and broadcast
 on prime-time television.
 Governmental bodies are responsible in theory and in fact for
 administering and drawing up policies, especially economic
 policies. At the top of the government structure are the
 collective State Presidency, the Federal Executive Council
 (Cabinet), and the Federal Assembly (Parliament). The
 Presidency is responsible for overall policy direction. The
 Cabinet is responsible for running the governmental machinery
 and proposing legislation, and has taken on tasks such as
 those associated with the country's foreign debts and economic
 reforms. The Federal Assembly in recent years has become a
 very active body. It frequently rejects Cabinet proposals,
 often by divided votes, holds hearings, and draws up its own
 proposals. Some Assembly delegates have used their seats as
 platforms for the expression of sharply critical or
 controversial personal or regional views, which have been
 widely reported in the press and frequently aimed at
 generating popular support.
 Selection to government bodies occurs through a delegate
 system. Nominations originate in the party's *mass
 organization,* the Socialist Alliance of the Working People of
 Yugoslavia, and proceed through a series of endorsements from
 other bodies (such as trade unions). On the local level,
 ordinary workers can and do play an active role in the
 nomination process. Only one candidate usually is nominated
 for each office, although some multicandidate elections took
 place this year within the Croatian Republic and Zagreb City
 Assembly. Virtually all major government functionaries are
 party members.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-Governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government has shown a willingness to discuss and raise
 general questions of human rights in international forums,
 including meetings of the nonaligned countries, review
 meetings of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in
 Europe, and in other multilateral forums. It is sensitive to
 Western charges of human rights violations within Yugoslavia.
 The Government issues visas to representatives of
 international human rights groups, but officials may refuse
 requests from these groups for appointments. The Government
 recently demonstrated its sensitivity to investigations of
 internal human rights practices by expelling a British
 journalist (who knew and had been in direct contact with some
 of the accused six Belgrade intellectuals) for alleged
 violations of Yugoslav laws and regulations. Nevertheless,
 representatives of other Western organizations, including
 Amnesty International and the American Bar Association, have
 been permitted to attend this trial.
 Both Amnesty International and Freedom House have issued
 
 
 1156
 YUGOSLAVIA
 reports on human rights issues in Yugoslavia. Freedom House
 has rated Yugoslavia 'partly free.' Amnesty International's
 annual report for Yugoslavia cites its concern about detention
 and imprisonment of political prisoners and raises various
 charges of ill-treatment during pretrial detention, unfair
 trials, poor conditions in some prisons, and use of the death
 penalty.
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 The population of Yugoslavia in 1984 was approximately 23
 million, with an annual growth rate of 7.2 per thousand.
 According to World Bank estimates, gross national product per
 capita in 1982 was U.S. $2,802. The dramatic variation that
 exists in per capita income levels among the various republics
 stems from historic, regional, and natural resource
 differences. Life expectancy at birth in 1984 was 71.6 years,
 and the infant mortality rate was 28 per 1,000 live births.
 There is an extensive system of social and medical security
 for those who are old, disabled, or without employment. The
 Government provides a system of day care nurseries for working
 mothers. Education is extensive, government-run, and free
 through high school. Adult literacy is estimated at about 85
 percent. In 1981, the primary school enrollment ratio was
 estimated at 66.1 percent.
 In 1984, the Yugoslav economy continued to suffer from the
 effects of a foreign liquidity crisis as a result of excessive
 foreign borrowing in previous years. Inflation, spot
 shortages of some consumer goods, and high unemployment
 clouded the economic picture. The econonic situation looked
 somewhat brighter in the later months of 1984, as the rate of
 increase in inflation began to abate, and production picked
 up. Nevertheless, the average Yugoslav has experienced a
 steady erosion of his living standard in recent years.
 The Yugoslav economy is decentralized, with a high degree of
 autonomy at the republic and local level. Yugoslavia limits
 the individual's ability to accumulate personal property for
 private commercial use. Farmers may own up to 10 hectares of
 arable land plus additional hectares of mountainous terrain as
 pasturage. Almost 85 percent of all land in Yugoslavia is
 privately owned. Small-scale private enterprise is permitted
 and is prevalent in some regions, especially in services.
 Yugoslav law imposes a legal limit of five employees, plus
 family members, in private enterprises. At present draft
 legislation is under consideration that would liberalize these
 conditions.
 Factories, in theory, are owned by society as a whole and
 entrusted to their workers, organized in enterprise-level
 workers' councils. In practice, the influence of the workers'
 councils varies. There are no business enterprises directly
 operated by the state, with the possible exception of some
 defense-related establishments and agricultural research
 stations.
 The Constitution charges government authorities at all levels
 with protection of the cultural rights of the peoples of
 Yugoslavia. The use of the major local language is required
 in official communication between Belgrade and the various
 republics, and local languages are used in the schools,
 
 
 1157
 YUGOSLAVIA
 courts, and local media. Each citizen has the right in theory
 and practice to address courts and government agencies in his
 own language. Despite government efforts, discrimination
 continues, however, particularly against ethnic Albanians and
 gypsies.
 The Constitution guarantees the equality of citizens
 regardless of sex, and the Government has taken steps to
 improve the status of women. Maternity leave for employed
 Yugoslav women is very liberal and is routinely granted for
 periods between 9 months and 1 year. Depending on the
 republic, working mothers are given day care allowances based
 upon their salaries and the number of children to be cared
 for. Also, for up to 2 years after the birth of a child, a
 working mother may take sick leave when her child is ill.
 The role of women in Yugoslavia's work force has slowly
 improved as a result of increased education and urbanization
 in the society as a whole. According to statistics for 1983,
 36.9 percent of the Yugoslav work force was composed of women,
 as opposed to 34.5 percent in 1974. However, women still hold
 relatively low positions in their respective fields of
 employment. While there is no woman on either the collective
 State Presidency or the party Presidency, the present Prime
 Minister (President of the Federal Executive Council) is a
 woman. The general situation of women is the result less of
 official discrimination than of cultural and historical
 attitudes.
