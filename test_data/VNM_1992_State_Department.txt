 VIETNAM
 The Socialist Republic of Vietnam (SRV) remains a Communist one-party state
 ruled by the Vietnamese Communist Party (VCP) through a 18-member Politburo
 and a Communist Party Central Committee of 146 members nominally elected by
 a party congress held about every 5 years. Government policies, carried out under
 the Council of Ministers, reflect guidelines-if not specific directives--laid down by
 the Politburo. The new Constitution promulgated in 1992 contains a new emphbasis
 on the rule of law. A new amendment states that "all human rights" are tbe re-
 spected. However, this and other guarantees, includin freedom of speech, press, as-
 sembly, and demonstration, are diluted                       by the law, al-
 lowing the government to restrict individual rights on national security and other
 grounds. In addition, articles concerning "democratic centralism" and "the leading
 role of the Communist party," which in the past have been used to justify limits
 on civil liberties, remain in place.
 While Vietnam's predominantly agricultural econom was undermined by years of
 doctrinaire socialism, it has recently benefited from the introduction of price incen-
 tives and market mechanisms. The abandonment by Vietnam of the most counter-
 productive aspects of Marxist-Leninist economic ideology has ptrduced an improve-
 ment in the lives of Vietnamese citizens, not only in the ghatly inreased availabil-
 ity of goods and services but also in the new freedom of ordinary people to engage
 in entrepreneurial activity.
 However, human rights abuses in the SRV continued. They include severe restric-
 tions on freedom of speech, press, assembly, and association, on worker rights, and
 on the right of citizens to change their government. The government crackdown on
 dissent begun in the spring of 1990, continued in 1992. In addition, the Government
 continued a progm that over the years has resettled hundreds of thousands of peo-
 ple-some forcibly-into anew economic zones" (NEZs). On the other hand, it re-
 mains easier to travel abroad and inside the country than was the case a few years
 ago. People talk much mre freely with foreigners, and there is an increasing sepa-
 ration between the party and the State. All remaining military officers and officials
 of the former Government of Vietnam who had been incarcerated since 1975 were
 released between the end of 1991 and early summer of 1992.
 Section i. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Incuding Freedom from
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicil Killing.-Statistics on the number of deaths
 of   o   slitical prisoners are not available. In 1992 there wree no known executions of
 poitical prisoners or politically motivated extrajudicial killings. According to credi-
 ble reports, however, prisoners have in the past died of exhaustion, physical abuse
 ions on    ,,rdomA  nf mphA, s,   and nthel effects of conditions in  risons and
 
 
 679
 
 reeducation camps. There were no known specific caes of such deaths in detention
 in 1992.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no documented incidents of political abductions by
 government security organizations or by antigovernment forces.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The law prohibits physical abuse, and released reeducation camp detainees report
 that camp conditions have improved since 1989. Nonetheless, there continued to be
 credible, consistent reports of police brutality during interrogation of suspects and
 the severity of conditions for those confined in prisons. These reports indicate that
 beatings or ill-treatment are still a feature of police investigations and a means of
 punishment in prisons, despite legal safeguards. In general, detainees face sub-
 standard nutrition, poor or nonexistent medical care, and severe and often arbitrary
 punishment for minor infractions of camp rules.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-In 1992 Vietnam continued arbitrarily to
 arrest and imprison people in contravention of its own law.
 The 1989 Criminal Procedure Code and subsequent amendments provides for var-
 ious rights for detainees, including time limits on pretrial detention, the right of the
 accused to be informed of the charges against him or her, a ban on coercion or cor-
 pral punishment, and the right to have a lawyer present during interrogation.
 However, in practice these safeguards are frequently ignored by the authorities.
 Credible reports indicate that detainees continue to be held incommunicado for in-
 defiite periods without formal charges, with authorities using old administrative
 procedures in contravention of the new legislation. The retention of these adminis-
 trative procedures and recourse to them instead of to the newer legislation appear
 to be a deliberate government policy.
 The Government continued its efforts to implement Party Directive 135, which
 calls for the arrest of those who incite opposition to the Government or advocate po-
 litical pluralism. As part of a protracted security crackdown, intellectuals, clergy,
 journalists, and some foreigners were arrested and detained. For example in 1990
 American citizen Michael Morrow was briefly detained and several of his Vyietnam-
 ese contacts arrested, of whom Do Ngoc Long and Doan Thanh Liem remain in de-
 tention. Mr. Liem, an attorney, was sentenced in May to 12 years for 'spreading
 anti-Socialist propaganda," along with the poet Truong Hung Thai, also known by
 his pen name, Nguyen Tr. Mr. Long, who apparently had not been tried by years
 end, is in ill health and reportedly being held in a hospital unit.
 In late 1991, the human rights activist Dr. Nguyen Dan Que was sentenced to
 20 yeas imprisonment; his associate Nguyen Van Thuan was given a 10-year sen-
 tence. By the SRV's own published account, Dr. Que, an international member of
 Amnesty International, was incarcerated for the peaceful expression of political
 views which the regime found unacceptable.
 Some party members, such as Duong Thu Huong, who criticized the party espe-
 cially to outsiders, were detained. Ms. Huong, a prominent novelist and party mem-
 ber, was subsequently released after 7 months' detention. Other party members,
 such as the mathematician Phan Dinh Dieu, who made fundamental criticisms of
 party practice, were not punished at all, and in fact Dr. Dieu was subsequently per-
 mitted to travel to the West.
 Legislation designed ostensibly to prevent inordinate delay in charging suspects
 is often, if not routinely, ignored. For example, Le Van Tien, 70 years oldand with
 a serious heart condition, was arrested, along with a number of associates, in Ho
 Chi Minh City on December 20, 1990. This occurred on the eve of his legal emigra-
 tion to the United States, just after he was released from 13 years' detention in
 labor camps. Tien was secretly charged with maintaining overseas contacts for the
 purpose of conducting espionage for the United States. He was released only on
 March 7, 1992, apparently in recognition of his very serious health problems. Others
 released in late 1991 or 1992 were pastor Vo Xuan, Father Le Thanh Que, the dis-
 sident poet Nguyen Chi Thien, and the noted author Doan Quoc Sy.
 No official statistics are available on the number of detainees arbitrarily held for
 antigovernment activities. However, since people can be detained without charges
 being filed, and trials and sentences are sometimes secret, any such statistics would
 almost certainly be incomplete.
 Search and arrest warrants are in use but are issued by security organs. There
 is no judicial review of warrants. Furthermore, law enforcement and security per-
 sonnel appear to be able to arrest and incarcerate people without presenting such
 documents to those being detained.
 Exile is not used as a means of political control although over the years the Gov-
 ernment has resettled hundreds of thousands of people--some forcibly-to NEZ's
 (see Section 1.f.).

 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Vietnamese court system consists of local peo-
 ple's courts, military tribunals, and the Supreme Court. The latter may review cases
 from either of the lower courts. Both the National Assembly and State Council have
 the authority to establish special tribunals, which may be superior to the Supreme
 Court. In addition, local mass organizations are empowered to deal with miwr
 breaches of law or disputes. Although technically judges in all regular court ae
 elected, candidates are selected by the party organization. Article 130 of the CMn-
 stitution provides for the "independence of judges and jurors. However, this is ne-
 gated at all levels by a political system that is closely controlled by the VCP and
 a selection process that puts a premium on political reliability.
 The Penal Code consists of the Criminal Code and a Criminal Procedures Code
 which was amended in 1990. Vietnam has a long-established body of family law, but
 lacks civil law codes.
 There is virtually no evidence that legislative improvements made in 1990 have
 ever been implemented. There have been reports of torture and coercion. to elicit
 confessions, although there were no specific reports of this in 1992. Secret trials are
 reprtedly still being held for some political prisoners.
 During the past few years, prison sentences have been frequently imposed by ad-
 ministrative procedure without benefit of due process or judicial review. In addition,
 such sentences are imposed on persons sentenced for peaceful expression of their
 views. The SRV criminalizes certain forms of peaceful expression including, for ex-
 ample, "anti-Socialist propaganda.' Over the years people have been sentenced to
 long prison or reeducation camp terms for such "crimes. Accurate statistics on the
 numbers of persons so incarcerated are not available.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home or Correspondence.-In 1992
 the Government continued to operate a nationwide system of surveillance and con-
 trol through household registration and party-appointed block wardens who use in-
 formants to keep track of individual activities. In general, reports suggest that the
 system is unevenly implemented throughout the country and that local caprice and
 corruption are significant factors. Urban dwellers appear to be increasingly relaxed
 about sending mail overseas and about meeting with foreign visitors. It appears that
 the Government is combining stricter surveillance designed in part to intimidate po-
 tential critics with some relaxation vis-a-vis the general population. Therefore, al-
 though censorship of mail and the confiscation of packages continued throughout
 1992, they appear to have been on a quite selective basis. The party expects people
 to belong to one or more mass organizations, which exist for villages, city districts,
 school, work (trade union), youth, and women. These organizations disseminate
 p arty propaganda, support party-sanctioned activities and play a watchdog role, but
 have become increasingly ineffectual. While membership in the VCP remains an aid
 to advancement in the state sector, there is evidence that recruitment of new party
 members has fallen off and that many older party members have ended their par-
 ticipation in party activities. In addition, membership in the youth union-the nor-
 mal path to VCP membership-has dropped sharply.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech
 and press, but in practice such freedoms are severely limited. The Government owns
 and operates broadcast media and does not permit the airing of opposing views, al-
 though it has broadcast reports of debates during National Assembly meetings.
 Party organs and the Ministry of Culture, Information, Sports, and Tourism control
 all newspapers, books, and other publications, as well as all cultural exhibitions.
 During 1992 the party continued to tolerate (and at times invite) criticism con-
 corning the performance of the party or of persons deemed to be corrupt or incom-
 petent. However, questioning the legitimacy of the VCP or its exclusive vanguard
 role is not tolerated. Short of clearly proscribed writing, such as advocacy of a
 multiparty system, the limits of criticism are not clear; some ideas may be expressed
 in internal party meetings and in internally circulated documents but not publicly.
 Criticism is occasionally expressed publicly within established forums, such as Na-
 tional Assembly proceedings broadcast over the national radio service. The Govern-
 ment does not use systematic prior censorship to control the media, but guidance
 from party watchdogs is pervasive, and national security legislation is sufficiently
 broad to encourage effective self-censorship in the media. A pervasive system of in-
 formants also chills free speech to a considerable extent.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The right of assembly is re-
 stricted in law and practice. People wishing to gather in a group are required to
 apply for a permit which is issued or denied by local authorities, often arbitrarily.
 According to refugees, in some localities citizens must obtain permission for gather-
 inav nf nver threp nennlp. Demonstrations are discouraged: those which do take
 
 
 681
 place are occasionally forcibly suppressed. Nongovernmental organizations are per-
 mitted, but they may meet only for approved and narrowly defined objectives. Oppo-
 sition political parties or organizations are not permitted.
 c. Freedom of Rion.- Vietnam has no state religion. According to some esti-
 mates, nearly three-fourths of the population of 70 million are Buddhists, but the
 Government has claimed that only 4 milion of these actually practice their religion.
 The Vatican believes that some 6 million Vietnamese are Catholic, A much smaller
 number are Protestant. Virtually all foreign clergy remaining in the south in 1975
 were expelled at the end of that year. While the SRV has permitted visits by foreign
 clergy, it has not been willing to permit their permanent residence in Vietnam.
 Adherence to a religion is not permitted for party members. During the past few
 years, visitors to Vietnam have reported that attendance at religious services is
 growing. These impressions, however, are derived from large urban centers. While
 restrictons on religious o rnzations are severe, they vary widely by locality. This
 is also true of church attendane.
 Freedom of worship is provided for in the Constitution, along with the proviso
 that no one may use religious adherence or belief to violate state laws and policies.
 The Government, concerned that religious groups might become competing centers
 of influence within the society, has consistently attempted to divide and control reli-
 gious groups, in part by establishing government-controlled policymaking bodies
 such as the Catholic Patriotic Association to which clergy are obliged to belong.
 The Government has also attempted to prevent the growth of religious groups by
 inhibiting the publication of religious materials and the training of new clergy. The
 Government exercises approval authority on the content of speeches and sermons
 by clergy, but reports continue to indicate that approval is generally granted as long
 as the content cannot be construed as a challenge to the legitimacy of Vietnams
 one-party system.
 The Government has regularly detained and arrested religious figures of all faiths
 on plitical grounds and restricted their activities. Charges of :possessing and die-
 seminating counterrevolutionary propaganda," fomenting unrest,' or anti-Socialist
 propaganda," have been leveled against Buddhist monks and nuns and Catholic,
 testant, and other religious leaders. A number of Catholic and Buddhist clergy
 arrested soon after the 1975 Communist victory remained in prison, or under house
 arrest, throughout 1992.
 Many other religious leaders remain under house arrest, are prohibited from con-
 ducting services, are denied family registration, or are otherwise harassed and im-
 peded in their attempts to conduct their ministries. There have been a number of
 recent arrests, including of Protestant clergy and lay Buddhist notables. For exam-
 p Ic, Protestant pastrs Dinh Thien Tu and Tran Dinh Ai were arrested in 1991.
 Dinh Thien Tu was subsequently sentenced to 3 years of imprisonment for operating
 a social work program without government approval and remains in Phan Dang
 Luu prison. Both pastors had extensive contacts with foreign groups. However, sev-
 eral other Protestant pastors who had been incarcerated for long periods after 1975
 were released in 1990 and 1991 and allowed to depart from Vietnam.
 Vietnam has in recent years expanded its dialog with the Vatican. In late 1990
 two new bishops f'or Vietnam were named, apparently without government inter-
 ference, and for the first time the Government allowed the bishops' conference to
 make their obligatory 5-year visit to see the Pope. In 1992, however, the Govern-
 ment refused to allow Archbishop Francis XavierNguyen Van Thuan to return from
 Rome to his bishopric in Ho Chi Minh City. Also, while the Government now per-
 mits Catholic seminarians to be admitted to seminaries every 3 years instead of 6,
 it still places sharp limits on the recruitment, training, ordination, and assignment
 of new seminarians, priests, menks, and nuns. The selection of bth students and
 teachers is subject to l~overnnient veto, arid there are continuing difficulties in ob-
 taining teaching materils and in expanding religious training faclities. Some rei-
 gious leaders believe that the Government's goal is to weaken the churches as a so-
 cial force by denying them personnel and the ability to move their people around
 the country. There are, f.or example, only 15 priests in Haiphong to serve over
 150,000 Catholics, and no religious women have been allowed to establish convents
 or novitiates there.
 Most property of religious institutions remains under government control, includ-
 ing temples, churches, convents, seminaries, former religious schools, libraries, and
 orphanages. Sharp restrictions are exercised on the use, repair, or extension of those
 facilities that are returned.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the County, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-During 1992 the Government continued the trend of recent years of al-
 lowing freer movement within the country for most citizens. Vietnamese are re-
 
 
 682
 quired to obtain permission to change their residence, but it appears that this has
 not been difficult during the past few years.
 Private travel abroad is usually restricted to 3 months, except travel for education
 or medical treatment. Violators of this limitation faced being barred from further
 travel for 3 to 5 years.
 The Government continued its program of relocating people into sparsely popu-
 lated NEZ's. The state-run radio has said that, of more than 2 million people who
 had been moved from their homes in cities or crowded areas, only a quarter had
 substantially improved their living standards. The report admitted that many of the
 NEZ's were unfinished or short of basic facilities. The Government's professed ra-
 tionale for relocating people to NEZ's is to reduce urban crowding, exploit little-used
 land, and thereby help develop the economy. However, there is little question that
 the Government also has used removal to NEZ's to isolate people it distrusts.
 The Government continued to permit emigration for family reunification and for
 Amerasian Vietnamese and their close family members. In January 1990, the first
 large-scale departures of former reeducation camp detainees and their families
 began pursuant to a US.-SRV agreement in July 1989 to permit such emigration.
 The U.S. Orderly Departure Program, including Amerasians, former reeducation de-
 tainees, and family unification cases, continued to resettle beneficiaries at the rate
 of about 7,000 persons per month. Other nations operate smaller resettlement pro-
 grams for Vietnamese nationals. Vietnamese who emigrate are generally free to re-
 turn. The Vietnamese Government regards overseas Vietnamese beth as a valuable
 potential source of foreign exchange and expertise and as a potential security threat.
 Thus, the Government generally grants visas to overseas Vietnamese and encour-
 ages them to visit Vietnam whether they emigrated legally or had been granted per-
 manent resettlement after illegal departures from Vietnam. At the same time the
 public security police keep an eye on them, especially those who come under sus-
 picion as a result of their actions or associations. During 1992 some overseas Viet-
 namese were arrested, detained, and deported for activities deemed to be subver-
 sive, as described in Section 1.d. above.
 In 1988 Vietnam signed a memorandum of understanding with the United Na-
 tions High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) to increase acceptance of voluntary
 repatriates, provided there was financial assistance. This agreement included a com-
 mitment by Vietnam to waive prosecution and punitive measures for illegal depar-
 ture from Vietnam by persons who return under the UNHCR voluntary repatriation
 program. Vietnam also agreed to permit the UNHCR to monitor the returnees by
 followup visits. This agreement has resulted in a substantial flow of repatriates
 from several countries back to the SRV. The SRV authorities appear to be honoring
 their agreement not to mistreat persons who repatriate. The Government appears
 to be actively accelerating the integration of returnees, in most instances, by the
 timely issuance of their family registration documents and the rapid enrollment of
 school-age children. Due in a large degree to the 1989 Comprehensive Plan of Ac-
 tion, the rate of clandestine boat departure from Vietnam fellt negligible levels by
 the summer of 1991.
 Although the source of refugees itself Vietnam has also been the country of first
 asylum for between 15,000 and 20,000 Cambodian refugees (mainly ethnic Chinese)
 who have fled to Vietnam since 1975. Repatriation of these refugees, who have been
 cared for by the UNHCR in well-organized camps, began in 1992.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 menit
 Citizens are not free to change their government. All authority and political power
 is vested in the VCP, political opposition is not tolerated, and no other political par-
 ties are tolerated.
 The Central Committee of the VCP is the supreme decisionmaking body in the
 nation; its 13-member Politburo is the locus of policymaking. The Secretariat of the
 Central Committee oversees day-to-day implementation of leadership directives. De-
 bate and criticism is limited to certain aspects of individual, state, or party perform-
 ance determined by the party itself. No challenge to the legitimacy of the one-party
 state, or even debate on this subject, is permitted.
 Citizens elect members of the National Assembly, ostensibly the chief legislative
 body, but are still constrained by party guidance. The 395 delegates were elected
 in the summer of 1992. Candidates for the National Assembly election were care-
 fully screened, and credible reports indicate that many people who wished to become
 candidates were not permitted to run because their views were not considered reli-
 able. Although candidates are screened by party front groups, they are not required
 Mi h nartv mmlprq themselves, and multiole candidates contest each seat. The law
 
 
 683
 provides for equal participation in plitics by women and minority groups, but in
 practice minority groups and especiany women are underrepresented.
 Section 4. Gommental Attitu   Reganing International and Nopgoernmnntal In-
 migation of A/eged Vidaions of Huwan Rights
 Vietnam does not permit private human rights organizations to form or operate.
 Moreover, it prohibits private citizens from contacting international human rights
 organizations. As mentioned in Section Ld, Nguyen Dan Que was sentenced to 20
 years in prison, partly because he was an international member of Amnesty rater-
 national. Since 1989, however, the Vietnamese Red Cross has been permitted ex-
 panded cooperation with the American Red Cross in assisting persons seeking miss-
 Ing relatives, including those in reeducation centers. The SRV has permitted inter.
 national visitors to monitor implementation of its commitments under the Com-
 prehensive Plan of Action.
 The Government carries on some dialog with human rights organizations. Some
 visits by human rights organizations are permitted, but the Government has limited
 their access to the penal system and its inmates.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Reigion, Language, or Social Status
 Many citizens still face discrimination in employment, education, and social serv-
 ices, or are subject to relocation in NEZ's, based on family background or political
 views, although less than in previous years. Family members of former South Viet-
 namese Government and military officials and people affiliated with anti-Com-
 munist associations or religious sects have been systematically discriminated
 against. According to refugees, people released from reeducation camps face consid-
 erable discrimination in education, housing, and employment. They do not regain
 their citizenship rights until one year after leaving the camps, if then. While their
 children sometimes are allowed to enter the university, they still appear to face dis-
 crimination within the university system.
 Gradual assimilation and co-option appear to be the Government's long-term
 strategy for ethnic minorities. The Government has created special schools in the
 Hanoi area for the education and indoctrination of members of minorities to be the
 eyes and ears of the party* among their own people. Highland minorities in central
 Vietnam are subject to repression if suspected of ties with resistance groups. Offi-
 cially programmed resettlement of ethnic Vietnamese into the highlands is designed
 in part to increase government control over minority groups. Even so, the Govern-
 ment appears to be trying to narrow the gap in the standard of living between high-
 landers and lowland ethnic Vietnamese.
 Priority in social services is given to families of party members and families of
 soldiers who fought for the Government. Testing standards of university entrance
 examinations are reportedly lower for children of party officials. Arbitrarily high
 standards are set to keep the children of suspect background out of a university.
 Study abroad is also restricted to politically acceptable persons. Nonetheless, the
 Government is giving higher priority to competence in academic pursuits.
 In general, women do not appear to face discrimination in employment. However,
 the   ace prblems competing with men for higher status positions owing to atti-
 tudes deeply ingrained tn traditional Vietnamese society. Such problems persist in
 spite of government efforts to mold popular attitudes to conform with the Constitu-
 tion, legislation, and regulations manating equal treatment before the law in vir-
 tualy al respects. Article 63 of the new Constitution provides that women and men
 receive equal- pay for equal work, and a lare body of legislat~on and regulations is
 devoted to the protection of women's rights in marriage as wel _as in the workplace.
 Government statistics indicate that approximately 50 percent of the primary school
 students are girls and that women represent about 39 percent of university stu-
 dents. The Government has claimed that women hold 46 percent of the senior posts
 in government and that 18 percent of the members of the ninth National Assembly
 are women. The most senior leadership, however, is predominately male, as can be
 seen, for example, in the all-male Politburo and Council of Ministers.
 There are no statistics available on the frequency of violence against women with-
 in the home. In 1987 then Chairman of the Council of Ministers Do Muoi issued
 a degree banning spouse beating, but it is not known to what extent it has been
 implemented.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Vietnamese workers are not free to form or join
 unions of their own choosing. All workers automatically become members of the
 union in their workplace, and dues are deducted from their pay. These groups are
 organized by the Government and belong to the government-controlled Confed-
 eration of Vietnamese Workers. Strikes are considered unpatriotic and officially for-
 
 
 bidden; none are known to have taken place in 1992. Vietnamese unions are not
 free to, and do not, join affiliate with, or participate in international labor bodies.
 In 1992, the Socialist iepublic of Vietnam, as a State, joined the International
 Labor Organization from which it had withdrawn in 1985.
 b. The _R'ht to 6ganize and Bargain Collectively.-Vietnamese workers do not
 have the right to organize unions of their own choosing or to bargain collectively.
 However, the Chairman of the Confederation of Vietnamese Workers is empowered
 by the legislation to attend conferences of the Council of Ministers and raise issues
 on behalfof labor that cannot be resolved at lower levels. SRV officials have stated
 that wages are set by a bureaucratic system and the wage scales provided for state
 corporations are imposed on newly formed enterprises. With an increasingly large
 private sector, local labor market forces played a greater role in wage scale deter-
 mination. The question of antiunion discrimination on the part of employers against
 employees seeking to organize does not arise. There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition o1 Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Compulsory labor is permitted by
 the Constitution, which states in Article 80 that "citizens must pay taxes and labor
 in the common interest as provided by law." Refugees report that every Vietnamese
 citizen is required by law to contribute 15 days of work per year to the state or pay
 a fee. A number of government projects have used forced labor provided by reeduca-
 tion camp prisoners.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-According to existing regulations
 inherited from the former French colonial administration, the minimum age for
 workers in Vietnam is 17. There is no reliable information concerning the enforce-
 ment of these regulations, nor are any statistics available on the number of child
 workers in Vietnam. Refugees report that children under 15 are exempt from com-
 pulsory labor requirements. Compulsory elementary education laws exist, but ap-
 pear to be honored mostly in the breach for the children of the poor. Vietnamese
 culture holds education in high regard, however, and families send their children
 to school if they can possibly afford to do so.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The Government adopted the former French
 colonial administration's system of regulations pertaining to working conditions, in-
 cluding a minimum wage; a maximum workday of 8 hours, a workweek of 6 days;
 and safety standards. Existing standards do not appear to be enforced universally.
 Wages are generally low in Vietnam inadequate to provide the vast majority of
 workers and their families a decent living. SRV minmum wages have long been
 rendered almost meaningless by economic inflation. Such safety standards as exist
 are developed jointly by the Ministry of Labor and worker organizations at individ-
 ual workplaces. Enforcement of the standards has been uneven. Labor union legisla-
 tion promulgated in July 1990 stipulates that if the union sees a life-threatening
 situation in the workplace, it may request that management correct the problem im-
 mediately and that a cessation of work, if necessary, be authorized. It further stipu.
 lates that the union has the right to participate in investigations of industrial acci-
 dents and to request that the Government or a court fix the responsibility for an
 accident.
