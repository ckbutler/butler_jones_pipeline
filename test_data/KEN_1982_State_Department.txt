 KENYA
 On June 9, 1982, Kenya formally became a one-party state upon
 passage of a constitutional amendment making the Kenya African
 National Union (KANU) Kenya's sole political party. This amend-
 ment formalized what had been Kenya's de facto situation since
 1969. The range of tolerated political activities in Kenya re-
 mains fairly broad, although somewhat more narrow today than in
 previous years.
 President Moi pledged in August 1982 that in the next parlia-
 mentary elections (currently scheduled for 1984) up to ten
 candidates would be allowed on the ballot. In the most recent
 parliamentary elections (1979), the typical Kenyan constituency
 had. between three and six candidates for election. Approximately
 60 percent of the incumbents were defeated, and of the 32 candi-
 dates whose electoral victories were challenged in court, seven
 were ousted. National Kenyan elections have occurred regularly
 over Kenya's 19 years of independence (1963, 1966, 1969, 1974,
 and 1979).
 On August 1, 1982, armed forces loyal to the Government of Kenya
 successfully repulsed an attempted coup mounted primarily by
 elements of the Kenyan Air Force. Kenya thus remains a consti-
 tutional polity under civilian rule, but the attempted coup may
 have seriously damaged Kenya's already fragile mixed economy.
 It also may have reinforced a trend toward decreasing Govern-
 ment tolerance of dissent. Private enterprise is practiced and
 encouraged, while the Government attempts to ensure an equitable
 distribution of public sector resources and expenditures.
 Kenya's Constitution promises protection for fundamental rights
 and liberties, and Kenya's judiciary has consistently exhibited
 elements of independence and impartiality. Over the past year,
 Kenya's earlier constraints on the exercise of freedom of the
 press and assembly have tightened somewhat. However, respect for
 basic human rights remains a widely practiced tradition in Kenya.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Killing
 The August 1 attempted coup included considerable violence in
 Nairobi, resulting in the deaths of scores of Air Force rebels
 and looters. There have been no other killings or political
 executions during 1982. Some banditry continues in the North-
 eastern Province, but it is not politically-motivated.
 b. Disappearance
 The Government of Kenya does not sanction secret arrests, abduc-
 tions, or other types of disappearances. Nonetheless, as a
 result of the events of August 1, certain members of the Kenyan
 Air Force and others remain unaccounted for and possibly have
 been killed, fled to neighboring countries, or are in hiding
 in the countryside.
 c. Torture
 Torture Is not sanctioned in Kenya. It is specifically for-
 bidden under the Constitution. However, in July 1982, two
 police officers received five-year sentences for having tor-
 tured a prisoner to death; the prisoner's widow received a
 court award of 250,000 shillings. Also in July, six policemen
 
 
 154
 were charged with having beaten to death an old prisoner in
 Wajir district; no verdict has yet been returned in this case.
 There have also been recent allegations with respect to regular
 police torture and beatings at the police stations in Gatundu
 and Murang'a. Government authorities are investigating these
 allegations.
 d. Cruel, Inhuman, or Deqradinq Treatment or Punishment
 Prison conditions are generally poor, and treatment of prisoners
 is often harsh. Constitutional provisions, however, explicitly
 prohibit cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment.
 Individuals detained under the Public Security Act are routinely
 denied face-to-face contact with family members. Letters
 screened by the authorities are occasionally permitted. Dis-
 criminatory treatment of non-political prisoners has not been
 reported.
 e. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 The Public Security Act, as amended in 1978, is an omnibus bill
 that includes substantial legislation and regulations which
 supersede constitutional safeguards. The act empowers the state
 to undertake, without reference or recourse to the judiciary or
 other governmental authority, actions over a wide range of cir-
 cumstances to control the activities of individuals that would
 otherwise be regarded as lawful.
 Although the Public Security Act authorizes political detention,
 it does contain certain procedural protections. Detainees
 must be informed of the reasons for their detention, and they
 have the right to have their cases reviewed by a special tri-
 bunal appointed by the President. The first provision is not
 always honored, however. Secondly, the tribunal meets in
 camera, and the Government is not bound by its findings.
 The Moi Government has formally detained nine persons under
 the provisions of the act since May 1982, the first since he
 assumed office in 1978; five of these are university lecturers.
 The other detainees are a member of parliament, a former member
 of parliament, a prominent Nairobi attorney, and Renya's former
 Deputy Director of Intelliqence.
 Aside from the Public Security Act, Kenyan law does not provide
 for preventive detention. Habeas corpus qenerally exists in
 practice, but occasional instances of "extra-legal" arrest
 occur.
 f. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The right to a fair public trial is upheld in Kenya aside from
 detention cases filed under the Public Security Act. Even in
 the courts martial conducted as a result of the abortive August
 1 coup, members of the press have regularly been allowed to
 attend and report on the proceedings. In normal civilian
 security cases, the authority of the regular courts is limited
 to ensuring compliance with the procedural provisions of the
 Public Security Act. Under Kenyan law, the defendant has the
 right to choose his counsel, but only in capital cases is the
 Government obliged to provide counsel for indigent defendants.
 Defendants frequently appear for preliminary hearings without
 counsel.
 
 
 155
 Civilians are tried in civilian courts. Military courts ad-
 judicate solely cases under military law affecting armed
 services personnel. Civilians charged with treason and sedi-
 tion in connection with the events of August 1 have without
 exception also been brought before regular civilian judicial
 authorities. Verdicts may he appealed to the Kenyan high
 court in all cases brought before civilian courts.
 *g. Invasion of the Home
 While in the past the sanctity of the home has generally been
 respected in Kenya, in the wake of August 1 police and security
 personnel routinely searched lower class dwellings without
 warrant and confiscated property alleged to have been looted
 during the abortive coup. Many poorer Kenyans in the Nairobi
 area lost lawful personal property during these extraordinary
 searches. Similar warrantless searches and seizures took place
 in middle class neighborhoods, though to a lesser degree.
 Survefilance techniques of security forces sometimes include
 electronic invasion of the home.
 2. Respect for Civil and Political Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Freedom of speech and press are proclaimed in the Constitution.
 In practice, however, these freedoms can be and have been
 narrowly defined under various sections of the penal code. The
 existence and recent use of the detention provisions of the
 Public Security Act clearly inhibit public exchange of views on
 sensitive political subjects, as does the government pressure
 brought to bear on journalists and publications that stray too
 far from the government line.
 The Government also discourages students and faculty from
 political activism. Each of the five university lecturers
 currently detained under the Public Security Act was detained
 prior to the aborted coup. Some students took to the streets in
 support of the coup attempt on August 1, and several dozen have
 subsequently been arrested and charged with offenses ranginq
 from rioting to sedition. Thus far, the harshest sentence meted
 out to a student has been ten years for sedition. All Kenyan
 universities remain closed, male students must report regularly
 to their village chiefs, and travel abroad for students and
 faculty has been substantially circumscribed.
 While Kenya has no formal censorship of the press, government
 guidelines are informally conveyed on politically sensitive is-
 sues, and deviations are dealt with swiftly and harshly. A July
 20, 1982 editorial by "Standard" editor-in-chief George Githii
 which criticized the Government's resort to detention, resulted
 in Githii's unanimous condemnation in the National Assembly, his
 dismissal through government pressure, and the confiscation of
 his passport. Althouqh the press is privately-owned in Kenya it
 is extremely sensitive to government influences. While there is
 no formal a priori censorship of published works in Kenya,
 authorities can effectively deny the public access to certain
 works. In August 1982, the Government banned articles critical
 of the Moi Government which appeared in the international press.
 In March 1982, the Government also refused to license two plays
 by Kikuyu playwright Ngugi wa Thionq'o, the performance of which
 was banned without explanation. A 30-member film censorship
 board operates out of the Attorney General's office and must
 approve all films to be shown in Kenya, but a wide variety of
 foreign films is regularly available. A 10-member television
 
 
 156
 censorship board based in the office of the president has estab-
 lished precepts which govern what can be shown on television.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 While the Constitution formally proclaims freedom of assembly
 and association, in practice these rights are sometimes limited
 by the Public Order and Police Act which gives local adminis-
 trative authorities wide powers to control public gatherings.
 It is an offense to convene an unlicensed meeting. Licenses are
 denied only rarely and usually on political grounds that the
 meeting might lead to some civil disturbance. The Government
 also can and occasionally has prevented political, religious,
 and social meetings under the Societies Act.
 Kenya has a relatively free trade union movement, but Kenya's
 complex labor legislation renders almost all strikes illegal.
 Strikes are permitted only if the Ministry of Labor has not
 taken action within 21 days of the formal declaration of a
 dispute to have it resolved. Althouqh the Minister of Labor
 has occasionally threatened to punish strike leaders under the
 provisions of the Trade Disputes Act, no union leaders were
 brought to court under this Act in 1982. In practice, strikes
 are rare in Kenya because of economic conditions and the com-
 plex rules which regulate the unions' right to strike.
 In August 1980, the Government formally disbanded the Kenyan
 Civil Servants Union, which was Kenya's largest union, because
 of its alleged political activities. The Organization of
 African Trade Union Unity has continued to complain about the
 Government's unwillingness to permit a genuine civil servants
 union, despite Kenya's membership in the International Labor
 Organization and its status as a sionatory to the convention
 guaranteeing freedom of association.
 All permanent workers in private enterprises of at least seven
 persons may be organized into trade unions. Approximately
 three-fourths of all such enterprise employees in Kenya work
 in such facilities, and about half (300,000) pay voluntary dues.
 Unions actually represent a greater number in collective bar-
 gaining, as workers not belonging to the unions are covered by
 collective agreements negotiated for their enterprises. Agree-
 ments are generally of two years' duration. A few professional
 voluntary organizations such as the Kenya Law Society exist, but
 limit their activities to professional concerns other than union
 matters.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 A wide degree of religious freedom exists in Kenya. No estab-
 lished churches are persecuted or given preferential status
 by the Government. However, the Government can refuse to
 register any society or group that it believes may pursue
 activities harmful to public security. The Church of Jesus
 Christ of Latter-Day Saints, or Mormons, has been trying with-
 out success to obtain registration under the Societies Act
 since mid-1981.
 d.   Freedom of Movement within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 The Public Security Act provides for the legal restriction
 of movement within Kenya for persons determined to endanger
 public security. In October 1982 a restriction was served by
 the Government on a leading politician known for his outspoken
 
 
 157
 opposition to the central Government; this is the only recent
 incident of this nature.
 In the wake of the events of August 1, the Kenyan Government
 has circumscribed opportunities for travel abroad. Kenyan
 authorities have seized the passports of several prominent
 Kenyans, and bureaucratic hurdles for government officials
 and private citizens to travel abroad have notably increased.
 Kenya does not, however, formally prohibit emigration of its
 nationals.
 While Kenya suffers from a high rate of urban unemployment, it
 has nevertheless accepted refugees. Approximately 4,100 docu-
 mented refugees now reside in Kenya. Of these, approximately 90
 percent are Ethiopian, Rwandan, or Ugandan. In May 1982,
 President Moi publicly reiterated Kenya's commitment to assisting
 refugees. In addition to those persons who have obtained offi-
 cial refugee status, it is estimated that between two and ten
 thousand additional persons have taken refuge in Kenya but are
 not legally classified as refugees by Kenyan authorities.
 Kenya does not actively discriminate aqainst refugees, and the
 five-person United Nations High Commission for Refugees office
 in Nairobi works through a variety of Kenyan agencies to assist
 refugee efforts to become self-sufficient and integrated into
 Kenyan society. The right of voluntary repatriation is generally
 respected.
 e. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Although KANU is Kenya's only permitted political party as a
 result of the constitutional amendment which was passed by the
 National Assembly in June 1982, a wide range of candidates and
 views is generally permitted in Kenya. While elections are not
 immune to political interference, the number of aspirants to
 a particular public office is frequently a half-dozen or more.
 In the most recent parliamentary elections which took place in
 1979, as many as 13 candidates contested a single seat; ten
 persons were barred from contesting these elections for politi-
 cal reasons.
 In August 1982 President Moi announced a major change in KANU
 procedures which will enable more grass roots candidates to
 contest parliamentary elections. Prior to the President's
 announcement, a parliamentary candidate had to be a KANU life
 member at a cost of one thousand shillings. The President has
 changed this requirement makinq regular KANU membership, which
 costs just five shillings, sufficient for candidacy. Although
 any KANU member may stand for a parliamentary seat, the prospec-
 tive candidate's suitability is sometimes determined by the
 Party.
 Although the constitutional amendment creating a one-party state
 was unanimously adopted, debates in the National Assembly are
 frequently characterized by spirited exchanges between Kenyan
 ministers of Government and backbenchers.
 The range of permissible discussion and opposition to government
 policies is relatively broad, and split votes in the National
 Assembly do occur. However, Kenyan authorities are not reluc-
 tant to delimit the range of acceptable conduct. Debates in the
 National Assembly have become increasingly non-controversial
 because of government pressure. Among these pressures was formal
 detention in August 1982 of Koigi wa Wamwere, a member of parlia-
 ment who was particularly critical of government policies.
 
 
 158
 Members of parliament are sensitive to the demands of their
 constituents, for in each national election since Kenya's
 independence 40 to 60 percent of the incumbents have been voted
 out of office.
 Kenyan society is patriarchal, and public attitudes toward the
 role of women in politics generally reflect traditional male-
 dominated values. Sexual discrimination is not, however, gov-
 ernment policy. A few members of the National Assembly are
 women, and women are sometimes appointed to national commissions
 formed to consider and make recommendations on public issues.
 Women are becominq involved in municipal and rural government.
 and they comprise the clear majority of the voting electorate.
 Although sexual discrimination is not the stated government
 policy, married women are employed bv the Government on a
 contract basis thereby reducing Job security in comparison to
 their male colleagues; moreover, female government contract
 employees are routinely paid less than their male counterparts
 for performing the same work, including the loss of perquisites
 such as housing benefits.
 Kenya is a multi-ethnic society where the task of assuring
 the opportunity to participate in politics to members of all
 groups has not always been easy. Under Kenyatta's presidency,
 it was sometimes charged that members of the Kikuyu tribe
 dominated the Government. Similar allegations are heard cur-
 rently with regard to the Kalenjin group.
 3. Government Attitude Regarding International and Non-
 governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations of
 Human Rights
 The Government of Kenya has been sensitive to media and inter-
 national criticism of its handling of the events of August 1,
 and has responded defensively to the negative portrayals of
 Kenya. In December, both President Moi and the Government, on
 separate occasions, vehemently refuted charges against the
 Government made in the foreign press.
 Various international human rights organizations, including
 Amnesty International, have initiated letter-writing campaiqns
 to the Government of Kenya with respect to the June 1982 deten-
 tion of a prominent Kenyan attorney who regularly represented
 controversial opposition politicians, but the attorney remains
 under formal detention in accordance with the provisions of the
 Public Security Act. Freedom House classifies Kenya as "partly
 free."
 While there are numerous organizations in Kenya which address
 certain aspects of human rights issues, there is no single group
 which focuses exclusively on broad human rights matters. Kenya
 has not yet placed before the National Assembly the Organization
 of African Unity charter on human rights which was adopted at the
 organization's July 1981 summit in Nairobi.
 4. Economic, Social, and Cultural Situation
 The Kenyan Government is committed to improving the country's
 health care, education, and standard of livinq, but recent
 economic performance has retarded progress in these areas. Real
 per capita growth of gross domestic product (GDP) has averaged
 less than 0.4 percent over the last six years. Kenya's eco-
 nomic problems are exacerbated by a population growth rate
 which exceeds four percent and is the highest recorded rate in
 the world. The events of August 1 dealt a severe blow to the
 
 
 159
 prospects of economic improvement. Annual gross national
 product (GNP) per capita is about $380.
 All wage and salary earners are covered by the minimum wage
 provisions of the Employment Act. Separate minimum wages
 exist for agriculture, the Nairobi and Mombasa metropolitan
 areas, other urban areas, and all other fields of employment.
 These rates were revised in August 1982 to partially compen-
 sate workers for inflation.
 About one quarter of Kenya's labor force in the formal sector
 (i.e. regular wage earners), work in agriculture, the field
 which pays the lowest wages. Approximately 85 percent of
 Kenya's 17.1 million persons live in rural areas, and 55 percent
 of them are believed to live below the poverty level. Western
 and Nyanza provinces contain the largest numbers of rural poor,
 who include among their numbers small farmers, pastoralists, the
 landless, and large-farm squatters. Estimates of casual labor,
 found mainly in agriculture and construction, range between 10
 and 25 percent of the total work force.
 All Kenyan wage earners are subject to Ministry of Finance
 guidelines which stipulate that waqe increases may not exceed
 three quarters of the increase in the cost of living since the
 signing of the previous wage agreement. Despite this obstacle,
 some unions have had demonstrable success in obtaining salary
 adjustments for union members by means of litigation filed in
 the industrial court. Some unions have also been successful in
 obtaining additional worker benefits, such as health insurance.
 All collective agreements must be approved by the industrial
 court before they take effect.
 Women constitute an essential factor in Kenya's labor equation.
 They provide about three-fourths of Kenya's farm labor, but
 still carry on with traditional familial responsibilities.
 There has been an historical outflow of males to cities, a
 migration embarked upon in the hope of obtaining employment in
 Kenya's wage economy, which has accelerated in recent years.
 This phenomenon has been particularly evident in western Kenya.
 As rural males migrate to the cities in search of employment,
 women find that they are left the predominant responsibility
 for agricultural production.
 Several of Kenya's better known tribes (the Kikuyu, Kalenjin,
 and Masai) still routinely practice female circumcision,
 although this custom has been declining over time. The Kenyan
 Government is making a major effort to eliminate this harsh
 ritual. In August 1982, President Moi condemned this practice,
 and high-ranking Ministry of Health officials ordered that such
 operations not be performed in Government facilities.
 Following independence, Kenya made considerable progress in
 health care. Recently, however, some positive trends have peak-
 ed and started to decline marginally. while life expectancy
 rose from 42.5 years in 1960 to 55.7 in 1978, by 1980 life
 expectancy had dropped slightly to 54.9 years. A similar pat-
 tern has emerged with respect to infant mortality rates which
 declined from 159 per thousand in 1960 to 83 in 1977; the most
 recent data (1981) indicate that infant mortality rates have
 not improved since 1977.
 In the past the Government has concentrated health expenditures
 on high-cost facilities such as hospitals, health centers, and
 dispensaries. In rural areas, however, such facilities often
 serve only one-quarter to one-third of the population. Kenya's
 health budget is heavily committed to the recurrent cost of
 
 
 160
 these static facilities. Community-based health systems that
 would integrate health, nutrition, maternal and child care, and
 family planning are included in the Government's development
 plans but have not yet been implemented.
 The most recent data (1975) indicate that only 17 percent of
 Kenya's population have regular access to clean water. Recent
 data (1977) on caloric consumption are considerably better,
 indicating that 88 percent of Kenya's nutritional require-
 ments are met.
 Primary and secondary education are stronqly encouraged in
 Kenya. The primary school enrollment ratio is 99 percent
 (1978), but of children ages 5 to 15, only 82 percent of the
 males and 72 percent of females are enrolled in.primary school.
 Secondary school enrollment exhibits a substantial drop from
 primary enrollment fiqures. Of all males between 15 and 19,
 only 25 percent are enrolled in secondary school; only 15
 percent of the female population in this age bracket are simi-
 larly enrolled. Only two percent of Kenya's college-age popu-
 lation are enrolled in institutes of higher learning, and of
 these students only two percent are female.
