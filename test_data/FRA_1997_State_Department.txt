 FRANCE
 France is a constitutional democracy with a directly elected president and Na-
 tional Assembly and an independent judiciary.
 The law enforcement and internal security apparatus consists of the Gendarmerie,
 the national police, and municipal police forces in major cities, all of which are
 under effective civilian control.
 The highly developed, diversified, and primarily market-based economy provides
 residents with a high standard of living.
 The Government respected the human rights of its citizens, and the law and judi-
 ciary provide a means of dealing with individual instances of abuse. Long delays in
 bringing cases to trial and lengthy pretrial detention are problems. Racially moti-
 vated attacks by extremists declined sharply from 480 in 1995 to 195 in 1996. The
 Government has taken important steps to deal with violence against women and
 children. Women continue to face wage discrimination. Although no killings oc-
 curred in Corsica during the year, there were over 200 bombings, many of which
 were politically motivated.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political
 killings.
 Law enforcement officers have used excessive force-particularly directed against
 immigrants-resulting in deaths, although there is no evidence of a pattern of such
 abuses. There were also a number of deaths in detention due to official negligence
 (see Section 1.c.).
 Two deaths occurred in suspicious circumstances at the hands of the police in De-
 cember. A 16-year-old North African was shot and killed trying to run a roadblock
 near Fontainebleau. In Lyons an unemployed 24-year-old was killed during interro-
 gation at police headquarters.
 The inquiry into the 1995 shooting death of 8-year-old Serbian refugee Todor
 Bogdanovic concluded in December 1996 with a dismissal of the charges against the
 police officer involved.
 The authorities concluded that there was insufficient evidence to take the case to
 trial. The victim's family has filed an appeal. Border police in the Bogdanovic case
 were accused of using excessive force in attempting to halt a convoy of refugees that
 ran a border check point. In January the judicial inquiry into the 1993 shooting and
 killing of 19-year-old Algerian Mourad Tchier by a police officer was passed to the
 Attorney General, and the policeman was suspended from active duty in March. The
 United Nations (U.N.) Special Rapporteur on Extrajudicial, Summary, or Arbitrary
 Executions, in a 1996 report, cited the Tchier case in expressing his concern over
 what he characterized as the increasing use of excessive force by law enforcement
 officers. A judicial inquiry into the 1994 death of an 18-year-old Senegalese youth,
 Ibrahim Sy, who was shot by a gendarme near Rouen, continues. The investigation
 is currently trying to determine which gendarme fired the lethal shot. An adminis-
 trative inquiry has been opened into the 1991 death of 18-year-old Aissa Ihich, who
 
 
 1079
 was allegedly beaten by police officers and subsequently died of an asthmatic attack
 because he was allegedly refused medication. In March gendarmes killed two home-
 less men who were robbing a store in Machecoul (Loire-Atlantique). The police
 claimed self defense, but witnesses say the men were unarmed. Two investigations
 were opened regarding the incident, one to investigate the cause of death of the two
 men, and one to determine if it was murder.
 In January a court convicted a former soldier, Georges Mendaille, of complicity
 in the attempted murder in 1985 of two suspected Basque terrorists. Mendaille was
 sentenced to 20 years' imprisonment.
 Judge Jean-Louis Brugiere completed his investigation into the bombing of UTA
 flight 772 in 1989 and handed over recommendations for indictments of six Libyan
 nationals to a grand jury. The brother-in-law of Libyan leader Col. Mu'ammar Al-
 Qadhafi is included in the group.
 Reza Mazoulian, an Iranian deputy education minister under the Shah, was shot
 and killed in Paris in 1996. Two Iranian nationals are suspected in the shooting:
 one is suspected of having fled to Iran; the other was extradited from Germany
 where he had fled, and an investigation is currently under way.
 In November 1996, the trial began of 41 Algerian extremists in connection with
 the wave of bombings in Paris in 1995 that killed 8 persons and injured over 170
 others. Of the 41, 3 are being tried in absentia and 38 are present at the trial. The
 group is accused of providing financial support, false documents, and other assist-
 ance related to the bombings to Algerian extremists.
 Internationally known terrorist Ilich Ramirez Sanchez, also known as "Carlos the
 Jackal," was convicted during the year in Paris of killing French security officers
 and a Lebanese informant 22 years ago. Sanchez was sentenced to 200 years in pris-
 on.
 Although no killings occurred during the year in Corsica, there were over 200
 bombings, many of wh ich were politically motivated.
 In the Basque region, a handful of politically motivated bombings occurred, which
 resulted only in property damsge. In June 42 B asque separatists, the majority of
 whom are French, went on trial in Paris. Many of the 42 were accused of terrorist
 violence. The courts sentenced 3 members of the Spanish Basque Fatherland and
 Freedom (ETA) terrorist group's "comando itinerante" to life imprisonment and 3
 others to 16 years' imprisonment for their participation in 21 terrorist actions be-
 tween 1978 and 1989, which resulted in 38 deaths and dozens of injuries. This
 marked the first time that ETA members were tried in France for crimes committed
 in Spain, although many ETA members have been tried in France for violating
 French law. France and Spain continue to cooperate to extradite ETA criminals, pri-
 marily from France to Spain.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearance.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The law prohibits such practices, and the authorities punish officials who employ
 them. However, there were credible reports that law enforcement officers used ex-
 cessive force, particularly against immigrants. Isolated instances of police mis-
 conduct occurred, but there is no evidence of a pattern of such abuses.
 The press reported an incident in February in which a French Communist Party
 supporter and his wife, both from Paris, were allegedly beaten in the Paris suburb
 of Val-d'Oise by several police officers claiming to be part of the extreme-right politi-
 cal group, the National Front (FN). The victims brought charges against the officers
 involved. Three police officers from Bobigny near Paris were convicted in June for
 a false statement concerning the alleged beating in April 1996 of an Indian refugee,
 Gernam Singh, but not for violence against the individual. Two of the officers were
 also convicted for being out of their jurisdiction. The senior officer was sentenced
 to 10 months in prison (sentence suspended) and a fine of approximately $800; the
 two junior officers under his supervision were sentenced to 15 months in prison
 (sentence suspended) and a fine of approximately $900 each.
 An administrative investigation was launched after a few dozen persons dem-
 onstrating against the FN in March in Marseille were beaten by riot police. To keep
 the anti-FN demonstrators away from their FN counterparts, the police, according
 to eyewitnesses, allegedly used excessive force by beating demonstrators and using
 tear gas grenades. In June the Gendarmerie launched a broad roundup of suspected
 pedophiles. Over 800 persons were arrested and detained, 4 of whom committed sui-
 cide after being released. The Gendarmes were criticized by human rights organiza-
 tions for being overly zealous in their investigation.
 The trial of three Marseille police officers accused of illegal detention, premedi-
 tated assault, and theft in the 1995 beating of Algerian-French national Sid Ahmed
 Amiri concluded in June. The court sentenced the officers to 18 months in prison,
 with 15 months suspended and a fine of approximately $5,000 each. The officers
 
 
 1080
 were barred from active duty in the police force for 5 years. Human rights organiza-
 tions criticized the court's decision on the grounds that it was not a fair punishment
 for the crime committed. A Bordeaux police officer accused of beating a demonstra-
 tor in 1994 was convicted in February and sentenced to 4 months in prison and a
 fine of approximately $1,000.
 Prison conditions generally exceed international standards, and the Government
 permits visits by human rights monitors. Most prisons provide opportunities for
 paid employment as well as recreational faciities. In its 1997 report, the French or-
 ganization, the International Observer of Prisons (IOP), noted an increasing number
 of deaths in detention attributable to neglectful surveillance and supervision. In one
 case, a court found five prison guards guilty of not coming to the assistance of an
 inmate dying of hunger. The report also criticized the prison system for cruel and
 inhuman punishment. It cited the case of Sophien Merzouk who fell into a deep
 coma and suffered advanced hypothermia as a result of being left in a room without
 sufficient heating. The report a so continued to criticize overcrowding in some pris-
 ons and noted a record number of inmate suicides, 138 in 1996 (latest available
 data). The IOP found that despite the passage of legislation in 1994 promising
 greater access to health care, most prisons have delayed needed reforms.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The law prohibits arbitrary arrest, deten-
 tion, or exile, and the Government observes this prohibition.
 In narcotics trafficking convictions, courts often assess a customs fine based on
 the estimated street value of the drugs, in addition to a jail sentence. At the end
 of their jail terms, prisoners who cannot pay the fine are detained for up to 2 more
 years while customs officials attempt to reach the largest possible settlement. This
 practice has been criticized by the European Court of Justice.
 A 1994 case continues against 6 of 26 resident non-French Muslims detained by
 police on suspicion of supporting Algerian terrorists. Twenty of the detainees were
 deported in 1995 after several weeks' detention.
 There are      visions for exile, and it does not occur.
 e. Denial Of Fair Public Trial.-The law provides for an independent judiciary,
 and the Government respects this provision in practice. The judiciary provides citi-
 zens with a fair and efficient judicial process.
 There is a system of local courts, 35 regional courts of appeal, and the highest
 criminal court, the Court of Cassation, which considers appeals on procedural
 grounds only.
 The judicial system has been criticized by credible sources for its inability to proc-
 ess suspects quickly. Some spend many years in prison before a trial even starts.
 According to the IOP, over 40 percent of all inmates are suspects awaiting trial. A
 system of bail exists.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The law
 prohibits such practices, government authorities generally respect these prohibi-
 tions, and violations are subject to effective legal sanction.
 In February a box of documents was found in the garage of the former director
 of the antiterrrist unit at the Elysee (the p residential palae) under former Presi-
 dent Francois Mitterrand. They detailed a large-scale wiretapping operation alleq-
 edy overseen by then President Mitterrand through the 1980's and early 1990 s
 that included the unlawful surveillance of political allies and adversaries, lawyers,
 judges, journalists, and other private citizens. Wiretapping is legally recognized as
 a right of the Government, and the National Commission for the Regulation of Wire-
 tapping reported a 30 percent increase in the number of official wiretaps during the
 year.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The law provides for freedom of speech and the
 press, and the Government respects these rights in practice. An independent press,
 an effective judiciary, and a functioning democratic political system combine to en-
 sure freedom of speech and of the press, including academic freedom.
 In 1994 the Government enacted a law mandating the use of the French language
 in certain limited circumstances. In June a Paris court dismissed a suit on technical
 grounds brought under the law against Georgia Tech University. The suit alleged
 that Georgia Tech violated the law because its Internet site was not available in
 French. The dismissal is being appealed.
 In February the elected mayor of Toulon, in southern France, a member of the
 far-right National Front (FN) party, dismissed theater director Gerard Paquet and
 attempted to close his avant-garde theater and cultural complex. A court rejected
 the Toulon mayor's bid to shut down the center. The mayor had earlier come under
 
 
 1081
 criticism by human rights groups in 1996 when he banned French-Jewish author
 Marek Halter from the city s annual book fair because the writer was born abroad.
 In 1996 the mayor of Orange (another southern town), also a member of the FN,
 used his police powers to halt the distribution of anti-FN literature in Orange. The
 measures taken by the mayor were promptly suspended by an administrative tribu-
 nal. A few weeks later, another mayor in the town of Lagrande-Motte temporarily
 suspended the distribution of anti-FN literature just before the start of a 1-week FN
 convention. This action was also promptly suspended. There have been other inci-
 dents of similar efforts by local officials to suppress anti-FN speech.
 In 1996 a criminal court sentenced two singers to 3 to 6 months in prison and
 imposed a 6-month ban on their performing. The charges stemmed from a 1995 con-
 eert where the group "NTM" performed a song in which the group advocated the
 murder of police officers. A court of appeals subsequently dropped the prison term
 from the sentence. However, in a separate incident in June, after encouraging an
 audience to shout obscenities at the police, the singers were fined approximately
 $8,500 and given a 2-month suspended jail term.
 In April a 21-year-old youth was arrested in the southern town of Essone for
 wearing a shirt bearing English expletives directed against the police. The youth
 was later acquitted by a correctional tribunal in Evry.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Assoeiation-The law provides for these
 rights, and the Government respects them in practice.
 in July the FN mayor of Toulon banned a celebration planned by anti-FN groups
 on the July 14 national celebration on the grounds that the city lacked sufficient
 security forces to deal with the celebration. Despite support from the Culture Min-
 ister for the celebration, the ban remained in effect.
 c. Freedom of Reigion.-The law provides for the separation of church and state
 and for freedom of religion, and the Government respects this right in practice.
 The State subsidizes private schools, including those that are church-affiliated.
 Central or local governments also own and provide upkeep for other religious build-
 ings constructedbefore 1905, the date of the law separating church and state. Cul-
 tural associations with religious affiliations may also qualify for government sub-
 sidies. Contray to practice in the rest of France, the Jewish, Lutheran, Reformed,
 and Roman Catholic religions in three departments of Alsace and Lorraine enjoy
 special legal status. Adherents of these four religions may choose to have a portion
 of their income tax allocated to their church in a system administered by the central
 Government.
 Debate continues over whether denying some Muslim girls the right to wear
 headcarves in public schools constitutes a violation of the right to practice their re-
 ligion. In 1989 the highest administrative court ruled that the "ostentatious"~ wear-
 ing of these headscarves violated a law prohibiting proselytizing in schools. After
 much media attention-mainly unfavorable-to the wearing of such headscarves, in
 1994 the Ministry of Education issued a directive that prohibits the wearing of "os-
 tentatious political and religious symbols" in schools. The directive does not specify
 the "symbls" in question, leaving school administrators considerable authority to
 do so. The highest administrative court affirmed in 1995 that simply wearing a
 headscarf does not provide grounds for exclusion from school.
 The city council of Marignane, a small southern town with a FN mayor, halted
 subsidies on public school lunches that did not include pork, penalizing Muslim and
 Jewish students.
 In 1996 a parliamentary commission issued a report that identified 172 groups
 as "sects," including Jehovah's Witnesses and the Scientologists. The Commissions
 findings led to calls for legislative action to restrict the activities of sects, which
 were rejected by the Government on freedom of religion grounds. Instead, the Jus-
 tice Ministry issued a directive to all government entities to be vigilant against any
 possible abuses by sects, and government offices were tasked to monitor potentially
 abusive sect activities.
 In 1996 a former leader of the Scientologists in Lyon was convicted of involuntary
 homicide and fraud, sentenced to 3 years in prison, and fined a pproximately
 $100,000. The charges stemmed from a 1988 suicide of one of the church a members.
 The court found that psychological pressure by the leaders of the Lyon
 Scientologists caused the member's suicide but avoided ruling on the issue of wheth-
 er Scientology is a religion. Other Scientlogists were also convicted of fraud related
 to this incident, fined, and given suspended sentences. In July a court of appeals
 in Lyon upheld the leader's conviction, but commuted his jail term to a suspended
 sentence. Five members were fined and given suspended jail terms of between 8
 months and 1 year, lighter sentences than those previously handed down, while
 seven were acquitted of eing accessories to fraud. The court, in its written decision,
 recognized the Church of Scientology as a religion. In response the Minister of Inte-
 
 
 1082
 rior stated that the court exceeded its authority and declared that the Government
 does not recognize Scientology as a religion.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The law provides for these rights, and the Government respects them
 in practice.
 The Government provides first asylum and provided it to approximately 17,200
 persons in 1996 (latest available data). The Government generally cooperates with
 the United Nations (U.N.) High Commissioner for Refugees and other humanitarian
 organizations in assisting refugees. However, in July the United Nations Human
 Rights Committee raised concerns about reports of unreasonable delay in the Gov-
 ernment's processing of asylum seekers in airport waiting areas and of the Govern-
 ment's efforts to limit U.N. access to these areas. The Committee questioned the
 Government's practice of penalizing air and ship carriers that transported refugees
 without legal documentation, arguing that the policy disadvantaged legitimate refu-
 gees. There were no reports of forced return of persons to a country where they
 feared persecution.
 Protests continued this year in response to a proposed law aimed at tightening
 procedures to stem illegal immigration. In March approximately 20,000 artists, in-
 tellectuals, and immigrants demonstrated in Paris, while 8 undocumented foreign-
 ers staged a hunger strike in the town of Lille. After 58 days, the Lille protesters
 were forcibly evacuated by the police. In June police evacuated 30 undocumented
 residents who were demonstrating in a town hall in Paris. The protesters were cele-
 brating the 1-year anniversary of the occupation of Saint Bernard's church in the
 summer of 1996, an incident in which 300 undocumented aliens occupied Saint Ber-
 nard's Church in Paris, protesting against immigration laws and asking to be al-
 lowed to remain in France. Virtually all of the 300 were allowed to remain legally.
 In June the newly elected Prime Minister ordered local authorities to accelerate
 the granting of residence papers to immigrants who complied with conditions estab-
 lished by the National Consultative Commission on Human Rights (see Section 4).
 The conditions favor families "well-integrated" into society, spouses of immigrants
 with legal status, children born in France and their parents, students, patients re-
 ceiving medical care, and refugees who would be in danger if sent home.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The Constitution provides citizens with the right to peacefully change their gov-
 ernment, and citizens exercise this right in practice through periodic, free, and fair
 elections held on the basis of universal suffrage.
 There are no legal restrictions on the participation of women inpolitics or govern-
 ment, but they remain significantly underrepresented in public offices, especially at
 the national level.-Eight of 27 cabinet members, 19 of 321 senators, and 59 of 577
 deputies in the National Assembly are women. To increase women's participation,
 some parties have established quotas for them on electoral lists or in party manage-
 ment.
 The citizens of the "collective territory" of Mayotte and the territories of French
 Polynesia, Wallis and Futuna, and New Caledonia determine their legal and politi-
 cal relationships to France by means of referendums, and they elect Deputies and
 Senators to the French Parliament.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 A wide variety of local and international human rights organizations operate free-
 ly, investigating and publishing their findings on human rights cases. Government
 officials are generally cooperative and responsive to their views. The National Con-
 sultative Commission on Human Rights (NCCHR)-which has nongovernmental as
 well as government members-also monitors complaints and advises the Govern-
 ment on policies and legislation. It is an independent body in the Office of the Prime
 Minister.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 Statutes ban discrimination based on race, religion, sex, ethnic background, or po-
 litical opinion, and the Government effectively enforces them.
 Women.-The penal code prohibits abuse as well as violence against women. Wife
 beating is a felony. The penalty for rape ranges from 5 to 20 years in prison, with
 no differentiation between spousal and other rape. There were 6,540 reported rapes
 or sexual assaults in 1995 (latest available data). Some 15,700 incidents of wife
 beating (including 98 which resulted in death) were reported to police in 1993 (latest
 available data). The Government offers shelter, counseling, and financial assistance,
 
 
 1083
 and operates a telephone hot line. The welcome centers for battered women added
 500 staff members in 1995. About 60 private associations also help battered women.
 While the law requires that women receive equal pay for equal work, this require-
 ment is often not the reality. A 1994 study (latest available data) found a mean dis-
 crepancy between wages of women and men of 20 percent in the private sector and
 18 percent in the public sector. The same study found that the unemployment rate
 for women averaged about 4 points higher than that for men.
 The law prohibits sex-based job discrimination and sexual harassment in the
 workplace. Thus far these laws have encountered difficulties in implementation.
 Women's rights groups criticize the scope of the law as narrow, and the fines and
 compensatory damages as often modest. For example, the law limits sexual harass-
 ment claims to circumstances where there is a supervisor-subordinate relationship
 but fails to address harassment by colleagues or a hostile work environment.
 Children.-The Government demonstrates a strong commitment to children's
 rights and welfare through well-funded systems of public education and medical
 care. The Ministry for Family Affairs oversees implementation of the Government's
 programs for children. There are strict laws against child abuse particularly when
 committed by a parent or guardian. In 1995 (latest available data) there were
 20,000 reported cases of mistreatment (physical violence, sexual abuse, mental cru-
 elty, or severe negligence) of children, an 18 percent increase from 1994. Of these
 cases, 5,500 involved reports of sexual abuse. Special sections of the national police
 and judiciary are charged with handling these cases. The Government provides
 counseling, financial aid, foster homes, and orphanages, depending on the extent of
 the problem. Various associations also help minors seek justice in cases of mistreat-
 ment by parents.
 Some immigrants from countries where female genital mutilation (FGM) is cus-
 tomary subject their children to this practice, which is widely condemned by inter-
 national health experts as dama  g to beth physical and psychological health. Au-
 thorities have prosecuted more tVan 23 cases of FGM since 1984 under the provi-
 sions of the Penal Code, which states that acts of violence towards children that re-
 suit in mutilation shall be tried in the highest criminal court. In 1996 a French Afri-
 can mother was sentenced to 5 years' imprisonment, 4 of which were suspended, for
 having her daughter mutilated. Later in 1996, another parent was given a sus-
 pended sentence. Since 1993 the Government and private associations have under-
 taken a campaign to inform immigrants that FG is contrary to the law and will
 be prosecuted.
 People With Disabilities.-There is no discrimination against disabled persons in
 employment, education, or in the provision of other state services. The Government
 announced several measures in 1995 to boost employment opportunities for the dis-
 abled. A 1991 law requires new public buildings to be accessible to the physically
 disabled, but most older buildings and public transportation are not accessible.
 Religious Minorities.-The annual NCCHR report (see Section 4) released in
 March noted approximately the same number of threats or attacks against Jews: a
 total of 88 incidents in 1996 (latest available data), compared with 89 in 1995. In
 April four former skinheads and neo-Nazi group members were sentenced to 2 years
 in jail for the 1990 desecration of a Jewish cemetery in the southeastern city of
 Carpentras. Two additional defendants received 20-month sentences for their role
 in the incident, in which 34 Jewish tombs were vandalized and freshly buried
 corpses unearthed and impaled.
 In January seven youths were arrested in the town of Saint-Files for the bombing
 of a Muslim prayer and cultural center. A second bomb exploded outside of a Paris
 mosque in March, slightly injuring the caretaker.
 National/Racial lEthnic Minorities.-Anti-immigrant sentiments sparked inci-
 dents including occasional attacks by skinheads on members of the large Arab/Mus-
 lim and black African communities. The-annual NCCHR report noted that racist at-
 tacks and threats, which doubled between 1994 and 1995, from 207 to 454, de-
 creased to 195 in 1996. No deaths were attributed by the NCCHR to racist violence
 in 1996 for the first time since 1993.
 The Government strongly condemns such actions and attacks and has strict
 antidefamation laws. Government programs attempt to combat racism and anti-
 Semitism by promoting public awareness and bringing together local officials, police,
 and citizen groups. There are also antiracist educational programs in some public
 school stems.
 Racial attacks resulted in five deaths in 1995; in all cases suspects have yet to
 be tried. Three FN youths await trial in the 1995 killing in Marseille of Ihrahim
 Ali, a 17-year-old shot in the back when FN youths opened fire on a dozen
 Comoriens during a political rally. Three skinheads were arrested and await trial
 for the 1995 death of Brahim Bouraam, a young Moroccan bystander pushed off a
 
 
 1084
 quay during another FN political rally. Another skinhead was arrested for theft in
 May 1995 and confessed that one of his friends had killed a Tunisian in April 1995
 in Le Havre by throwing him into the harbor. In May 1995, an FN militant stabbed
 an Algerian to death after an altercation in Cherbourg. Another right-wing militant
 awaits trial for beating to death a North African immigrant in September 1995 in
 Bayonne.
 In November the National Assembly adopted a law granting automatic French na-
 tionality to children born in France of foreign parents once they reach the age of
 18, provided that they have lived in France for at least 5 years since the age of 11,
 continuously or during different periods. If they choose, they can also become
 French as young as age 13, with the residence period dating from the age of 8. The
 new law relaxes tough legislation passed by the previous conservative government
 in 1993. Under the new law, teenagers have the right to reject French nationality
 in the 6 months before turning 18 years of age or within a year afterward. A for-
 eigner who marries a citizen can now claim French nationality a year after marriage
 instead of 2 years.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution provides for freedom of association
 for all workers. Trade unions exercise significant economic and political influence,
 although only about 10 percent of the work force is unionized. Unions have legally
 mandated roles (as do employers) in the administration of social institutions, includ-
 ing social security (health care and most retirement systems), the unemployment in-
 surance system, labor courts, and the economic and social council, a constitutionally
 mandated consultative body.
 Unions are independent of the Government, and most are not aligned with any
 political party. Many of the leaders of the General Confederation of Labor and its
 unions, however, be ong to the Communist Party. Unions can freely join federations
 and confederations, including international bodies.
 Workers, including civil servants, are free to strike except when a strike threatens
 public safety. One-fourth of all salaried employees work for the Government. Strikes
 in the public sector occur frequently and receive extensive media coverage. The
 number of workdays lost to strike action approached a postwar low in 1997, despite
 several widely publicized national strikes. Interns and workers at a number of
 teaching hospitals went on strike for nearly 2 months starting in early March over
 government-proposed cutbacks in national medical benefits, wages, and working
 conditions. Airline pilots disrupted domestic and international air traffic during
 April, May, and November in protest over pay, working conditions, and the imple-
 mentation of a merger between Air France and a domestic airline. Conductors on
 the state-owned railway in April sporadically disrupted service, particularly in the
 south of France, through a series of brief strikes over staff reductions, work sched-
 ules, and allowances. A 1-day nationwide railway strike in October, which included
 Paris subway trains, caused more widespread disruptions. Truck drivers in May
 mounted a limited strike to protest the failure of some trucking companies to honor
 the terms of an agreement that ended a late 1996 nationwide truckers strike. A 5-
 day national truckers' strike in November blocked or slowed down traffic on major
 highways. Other notable labor actions included: a peaceful occupation of the head-
 quarters of Credit Immobilier bank in January over prospective job losses; a 1-day
 strike by journalists in November over government plans to end a tax break for
 members of their profession; strikes in December at two government-owned tele-
 vision channels over pay, working conditions, and reorganization plans; transit
 workers' strikes in regional cities over pay, work time, and job security; a strike in
 November by lawyers, clerks, and judges demanding more staff; and recurrent
 strikes by shipyard workers in Brest over cutbacks in the defense industry. The
 turnout was low for a general strike called by public sector workers in early March.
 European and French unions in early June staged a march in Paris protesting high
 unemployment throughout the continent.
 The law prohibits retaliation against strikers and strike leaders, and the Govern-
 ment effectively enforces this provision.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Workers, including those in
 the three small export processing zones, have the right to organize and bargain col-
 lectively. The law strictly prohibits antiunion discrimination; employers found guilty
 of such activity are required to correct it, including the reinstatement of workers
 fired for union activities.
 A 1982 law requires at least annual bargaining in the public and private sector
 on wages, hours, and working conditions at both plant and industry levels but does
 not require that negotiations result in a signed contract. In case of an impasse, gov-
 ernment mediators may impose solutions that are binding unless formally rejected

 by either side within a week. If no new agreement can be reached, the contract from
 previous year remains valid. Over 90 percent of the private sector work force
 is covered by collective bargaining agreements negotiated at national or local levels.
 Trilateral consultations (unions, management, and government) also take place on
 such subjects as the minimum wage, temporary work, social security, and unem-
 ployment benefits. Labor tribunals, composed of worker and employer representa-
 tives, are available to resolve complaints.
 The law requires businesses with more than 50 employees to establish a works
 council, through which workers are consulted on training, working conditions, profit-
 sharing, and similar issues. Works councils, which are open to both union and non-
 union employees, are elected every 2 years.
 The Constitution's provisions for trade union rights extend to France's overseas
 departments and territories.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced or compulsory labor, in-
 cluding that performed by children, is prohibited by law, and the Government effec-
 tively enforces this provision. In its 1993 report, however, the International Labor
 Organization's Committee of Experts (COE) questioned the French practice of oblig-
 ing prisoners to work for private enterprises at less than the national minimum
 wage. In 1995 the Government officially responded to the COE, pointing out that
 prisoners participate in a work program on a voluntary-not a mandatory-basis,
 that more prisoners request work than can be accommodated, and that the work is
 designed to prepare prisoners for reentry into the labor force.
 d. Stats of ChildLabor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment.-With a
 few exceptions for those enrolled in certain apprenticeship programs or working in
 the entertainment industry children under the age of 16 may not be employed. Gen-
 erally, work considered arduous or work between the hours of 10 p.m. and 5 a.m.
 may not be performed by minors under age 18. Forced or bonded child labor is pro-
 hibited by law, and the Government effectively enforces this prohibition (see Section
 6.c.). Laws prohibiting child employment are effectively enforced through periodic
 checks by labor inspectors, who have the authority to take employers to court for
 noncompliance with the law.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The administratively determined minimum
 wage, revised whenever the cost-of-living index rises 2 percentage points, is suffi-
 cient to provide a decent standard of living for a worker and family. The wage was
 changed to $6.57 (F 39.43) per hour as of July 1.
 The legal workweek is 39 hours, with a minimum break of 24 hours per week.
 Overtime is restricted to 9 hours per week.
 The Ministry of Labor has overall responsibility for policing occupational health
 and safety laws. Standards are high and effectively enforced. Workers have the
 right to remove themselves from dangerous work situations. The law requires each
 enterprise with 50 or more employees to establish an occupational health and safety
 committee. Over 75 percent of all enterprises, covering more than 75 percent of all
 employees, have fully functioning health and safety committees.
 GEORGIA
 Georgia declared independence from the Soviet Union in 1991. Multiparty par-
 liamentary elections followed a short-lived military coup in 1992 that ousted the
 elected government of Zviad Gamsakhurdia. In August 1995, Parliament adopted a
 Constitution that provides for an executive branch that reports to the President, a
 legislature, and an independent judiciary. In November 1995, Eduard Shevardnadze
 was elected President, and a new Parliament was selected in elections described by
 international observers as generally consistent with democratic norms except in the
 self-governing region of Ajara. The President appoints ministers with the consent
 of the Parliament. The judiciary is subject to executive pressure.
 Internal conflicts in Abkhazia and So uth Ossetia that erupted in the early 1990's
 remain unresolved, although cease-fires in both areas are in force. These conflicts,
 tether with problems created by roughly 250,000 internally displaced persons
 (~s), pose the gratest threat to national stabiity. In 1993 Abikhaz separatists
 won control of Abkhazia, and most ethnic Georgians, a large plurality of the popu-
 lation, fled the region. In 1994 Russian peacekeeping forces representing the Com-
 monwealth of Independent States (CIS) deployed in the conflict area with the agree-
 ment of the Government and the Abkhaz separatists. Despite the presence of peace-
 keepers, there has been only very limited repatriation of ethnic Georgian JDP's,
 apart from some spontaneous returns to the Gali region of Abkhazia, where the se-
 curity situation remains unstable. A Russian peacekeeping force has been in South
 
 
 1086
 Ossetia since June 1992. Repatriation to South Ossetia has also been slow. The Gov-
 ernment has no effective control over either Abkhazia or South Ossetia. There were
 no large-scale armed hostilities in South Ossetia or Abkhazia in 1997, but the inten-
 sity and frequency of partisan warfare inAbkhazia increased. Abkhaz and Georgian
 armed criminal bands were also active in Abkhazia.
 The Ministry of Interior (MVD) and Procuracy have primary responsibility for law
 enforcement, and the Ministry of State Security (MGB, formerly KGB) plays a sig-
 nificant role in internal security. In times of internal disorder, the Government may
 call on the army. Reformist, elected, civilian authorities still maintain inadequate
 control of the law enforcement and security forces. In particular representatives of
 the MVD and Procuracy committed serious human rights abuses.
 The economy continued its turnaround, with a growth rate estimated by the Inter-
 national Monetary Fund (IMF) at 10 percent. The economy is primarily agricultural.
 Foreign aid remains an essential component of the economy. The country began a
 second stage of economic reforms to complete the transition to a free market econ-
 omy, but the ongoing energy crisis remains an obstacle to economic progress. The
 IMP estimated annual per capita gross domestic product at over $850.
 The Government continued efforts to improve its uneven human rights record, but
 serious problems remain. Police and security forces routinely abuse and beat pris-
 oners and detainees, force confessions, and fabricate or plant evidence. Inhuman
 prison conditions, along with abuse, led to deaths in custody. Corrupt and incom-
 petent judges seldom displayed independence from the executive branch, leading to
 trials that were neither fair nor expeditious. Law enforcement agencies illegally
 interfered with citizens' right to privacy at times and limited freedom of assembly,
 violently dispersing peaceful rallies. The Government constrains some press free-
 doms. Discrimination against women is also a problem.
 Senior government officials openly acknowledged serious human rights problems,
 especially those linked to law enforcement agencies, and sought international advice
 and assistance on needed reforms. However, while structural reforms designed to
 improve respect for human rights continued to be implemented, there was no
 change in the practices of the law enforcement agencies.
 Nevertheless, increased citizen awareness of democratic values, and growth of
 civil society provided some check on the excesses of law enforcement agencies. The
 Parliament challenged the law enforcement agencies by forcing the resignation of
 the Security Minister and by investigating charges of abuse. Parliament passed a
 Law on the Courts designed to increase judicial competence and independence as
 well as a new Criminal Procedures Code that puts into effect constitutional protec-
 tions. Independent newspapers showed greater maturity and a continued willing-
 ness to criticize government policies and actions. The number, variety, and sophis-
 tication of independent nongovernmental organizations (NGO's) grew, as did their
 ability to speak out for, and defend the rights of, individual citizens.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-Government authorities reported
 that during the year 92 people died while in prison or pretrial detention, compared
 with 1996, when 74 people died in prison and 13 died in pretrial detention. All of
 the 1997 deaths were officially attributed to medical causes, most of them to tuber-
 culosis. According to the International Committee for the Red Cross (ICRC), tuber-
 culosis is endemic in the prison system, in recognition of which the ICRC began a
 program to reduce its incidence. Physical abuse and torture of prisoners also played
 a role in the prison mortality rate. Credible sources within the Government report
 that the death of Zurab Toidze, a leader of the now outlawed paramilitary
 Mkhedrioni Group, was due to the effects of mistreatment (see Section 1.c.). Akaki
 Iaobashvili, who was detained in July on suspicion of involvement in a kidnaping,
 died shortly thereafter as the result of falling from the sixth floor of MVD head-
 quarters while being interrogated. Local human rights monitors reported that he
 was thrown from the window. An investigation was undertaken, but by year's end
 had produced no results. A police captain was sentenced to imprisonment for the
 death of a man he had beaten (see Section 1.c.).
 Perpetrators of atrocities and other political killings on the part of individuals on
 either side of the separatist conflict in Abkhazia are not being investigated, pros-
 ecuted, or punished. The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights and
 the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) mission estab-
 lished a joint human rights office in Sukhumi, Abkhazia, to investigate security inci-
 dents and human rights abuses. President Shevardnadze continued to urge the
 
 
 1087
 United Nations to create a body to investigate and punish those guilty of crimes
 against humanity in Abkhazia.
 b. Disappearance.--Georgan and Abkhaz commissions on missing persons report
 that the fate of over 1,000 Georgians and approximately 800 Ahkhaz who dis-
 appeared as a result of the war in Abkhazia is still unknown. No progress has been
 made in determining their whereabouts. The two sides to the conflict did cooperate
 on occasional exchanges of prisoners. The OSCE reported that only six Georgians
 and two Abkhaz are known to remain in each other's custody. Partisan groups ac-
 tive in Abkhazia periodically take hostages. The Abkhaz authorities periodically
 round up young Georgian males in the predominantly ethnic Georgian region of Gall
 and impress them into service in the Abkhaz military.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution forbids the use of torture, but serious abuses occur. Members of
 security forces continued to beat and abuse prisoners and detainees on a routine
 basis, usually in order to extract confessions. The most serious incidents of abuse
 occur in the investigative stage of pretrial detention when suspects are interrogated
 by police. Zurab Toidze (see Section L.a.) died in May from an asthmatic seizure
 brought on by beatings he received while in pretrial detention. A lawsuit has been
 filed and an investigation began into the case. Credible sources report that Akaki
 Kaobashvilli was mistreated before his death (see Section L.a.) In the past, security
 forces have tortured some defendants in politically sensitive cases, such as members
 of the former Gamsakhurdia government, and members of the paramilitary
 Mkhedrioni (see Section i.e.). In May security forces beat journalists who were re-
 porting on a rally of Gamsakhurdia supporters (see Section 2.b.).
 Government officials continue to claim that a lack of proper training and super-
 vision of investigators and guards often results in cases of abuse. Corruption and
 criminality also play a role. A number of policemen have been arrested or dis-
 ciplined for physical abuse. However, this action tends to occur only in extreme
 cases, such as those resulting in death. In July police captain Paata Bezhanishvili
 was sentenced to 4 years' imprisonment for the December 1996 death of Georgi
 Amashukeli. Amashukeli, whose car crashed into a police car and died in the hos-
 pital after having been beaten by Bezhanishvili.
 Members of the Parliamentary Committee on Human Rights and Ethnic Relations
 and local human rights groups independently investigate claims of abuse. Despite
 fear of retaliation, many individuals file claims. The Government also named a
 human rights advisor to the National Security Council to investigate claims of
 abuse. In November the constitutionally mandated Office of Human Rights De-
 fender, created in 1995, was finally filled. At year's end, the Office was not fully
 functioning (see Section l.d.).
 Local human rights observers report that abuse most commonly occurs in two pre-
 trial detention facilities, Isolator 5 in Tbilisi and the facility in Kutaisi. Isolator 5
 is located in the basement of the MVD headquarters and is the facility in which
 detainees suspected of a serious crime, or whose cases have political overtones, are
 incarcerated. The individuals arrested in connection with the assassination attempt
 on President Shevardnadze in August 1995 are held in this facility. According to
 local human rights observers, despite calls by senior law enforcement officials for
 investigators to show restraint, virtually every detainee brought to Isolator 5 is
 beaten. Often the threat of incarceration in this facility is sufficient to induce a con-
 fession.
 Prison authorities admit that conditions are inhuman in many facilities. They
 blame inadequate cells, medicine, and food on a lack of resources. For example, in
 Isolator 5 more than 2,000 inmates are housed in a prison designed for fewer than
 1,000. Cells can contain as many as 36 inmates with so few beds that they must
 sleep in shifts. The lack of proper sanitation, medical care, and food poses a serious
 threat to the life and health of prisoners. Tuberculosis is a particular problem and
 was responsible for many of the deaths of individuals in custody (see Section L.a.).
 Government plans announced in 1995 to build new facilities remain unfulfilled.
 The ICRC had full access to detention facilities in accordance with its customary
 procedures, which include meetings with detainees without the presence of third-
 party observers and regular repetition of visits. In June President Shevardnadze is-
 sued a decree instructing the Ministers of Security, Interior, and the Procuracy to
 "take measures for the halting of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading
 treatment." Following this decree, international human rights monitors reported en-
 hanced cooperation on the part of government officials and increased access to pris-
 oners. The OSCE mission and foreign diplomats were granted access to visit pris-
 oners and detainees. However, local human rights groups reported that they still
 encountered obstacles in visiting detainees, especially those whose cases have politi-
 cal overtones.
 
 
 1088
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution includes provisions to
 protect citizens against arbitrary arrest and detention; however, authorities fre-
 quently violated these provisions. The Constitution provides for a 9-month period of
 maximum pretrial detention, mandated court approval of detention after 72 hours,
 and restrictions on the role of the rosecutor (see Section i.e.). These safeguards are
 not yet in force and not observed. A new Criminal Procedures Code, along with
 other legislation to implement constitutional protections and restrict the powers of
 the Procuracy athe he police was passed by Parliament in November, but by year's
 end it was not yet in force (see Section i.e.).
 In the absence of the new Criminal Procedures Code, the Criminal Code of the
 former Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic continues to be used by a law enforcement
 and court system that is still beginning to adapt to democratic norms. Under Soviet
 law, prosecutors issued warrants for arrests and searches without court approval.
 Persons could be legally detained for up to 72 hours without charge. After 72 hours,
 the prosecutor was required to approve the detention, However, this approval was
 often a formality since it was normally the prosecutor who initiated the arrest in
 the first place. The law allowed for a maximum of 18 months of detention before
 trial.
 In practice even these prvisions are frequently violated. Virtually no means are
 available for accused individuals to present their cases to a judge prior to trial. This
 effectively means that pretrial detention is at the discretion of the prosecutor. Per-
 sons detained on suspicion of involvement in the attempted assassination of Presi-
 dent Shevardnadze in 1995 were held without trial for 27 months before the trial
 imally began in December.
 There were no cases of forced exile.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-t7e Constitution provides for an independent judi-
 ciary, but in practice the judiciary often does not exercise independence. Prior to
 adoption of the Constitution, the courts were often influenced by pressure from the
 executive branch. This pattern continues, with judicial authorities frequently defer-
 ring to the executive branch, particulariy at lower levels of the court system. Inves-
 tigators routinely plant or fabricate evidence nd extort confessions in direct viola-
 tion of the Constitution. Judges are generally reluctant to exclude evidence obtained
 illegally over the objection of the Procuracy. Local human rights observers also re-
 port widespread judicial incompetence and corruption, incling the payment of
 bribes to rosecutors and judges, which also leads to denial of justice.
 A new Law on the Courts, designed to enhance judicial independence, was passed
 by Parliament in June. Under the new law, Georgia retains a tbree-tier court sys-
 tem. At the lowest level are the district courts, which hear both routine criminal
 and civil cases. At the next level are regional courts of appeal, which serve as appel-
 late courts for the district courts; they review cases, and either confrm verdicts or
 return cases to the lower court for retrial. The regional courts also tiy major crimi-
 nal and civil cases. The judicial regions intentionally do not coincide with political
 regions in order to lessen the ability of appointed regional executive branch officials
 to pressure the courts. The Supreme Court, the highest level, acts as an appellate
 court. Administration of the court system was moved from the Ministry of Justice
 to a new Council of Justice. The Council has 12 members, 4 selected from within
 each branch of government. The law set up a testing procedure for current and pro-
 spective judges to be administered by the Council. The testing procedure is designed
 to reduce judicial incompetence. Judges' salaries were raisedto the level of par-
 liament members to reduce incentives for corrpttion.
 A separate Constitutional Court was createdin 1996. Its mandate includes arbi-
 tratin constitutional disputes between the branches of government and ruling on
 individual claims of human rights violations. The Court chose to interpret this latter
 function narrowly, agreeing to role only on cases where the complaint alleges that
 the violation was sanctioned by law. The Court rejected numerous complaints that
 alleged that an illegal violation of human rights had occurred.
 According to the Constitution, a detainee ispresumed innocent and has the right
 to a public trial. A detainee has the right to demand immediate access to a lawyer
 and to refuse to make a statement in the absence of counsel. The detaining officer
 must inform the detainee of his rights and must notify the detainee's family of his
 location as soon as possible. These rights mark a significant departure from Soviet
 legal practice, but they are not fully observed. Defense attorneys must still obtain
 permission from the investigator to visit clients, and permission is often refused. In-
 vstigators seldom inform individuals of their rights.
 The legislation required to implement constitutional guarantees was passed by
 Parliament in November. The implementing legislation included a Criminal Proce-
 dures Code   n a law on the Procuracy. These laws are designed to create a legal
 system with adversarial trials by reducing the pervasive powers of the Procuracy,
 
 
 1089
 increasing the rights of defense attorneys, and enhancing the independence and au-
 thority of the ju *cisry. Currently, Soviet law continues to be used. Under Soviet
 law, prosecutors are vested with ~owers greater than those of judges and defense
 attorneys. Prosecutrs direct criminal investigations, supervise some judicial func-
 tions, and represent the State in trials. Trials are not conducted in an adversarial
 manner. Prosecutors continued to wield disproportionate influence over outcomes.
 Under Soviet law, the State must provide legal counsel if the defendant is unable
 to afford one. In fact the State provided virtually all criminal defense attorneys, as
 they remain by and large employees of the State. Attorneys are assigned to a case
 by the Office of Legal Assistance, a part of the state-controlled Bar Association,
 upon the recommendation of the Procurator's Office. Private attorneys are allowed
 in criminal cases only with the express written approval of the Office of Legal As-
 sistance. Parties to civil cases are permitted to choose their attorney.
 In recent years, the Government has tried Badri Zarandia, Loti Kobalia, Nugzar
 Molodinashvil, and other members of the former Gamsakhurdia government who
 fought against forces loyal to the Shevardnadze Government. In these cases, the
 Government consistently violated due process during the investigation and trial.
 Torture, use of forced confessions, fabricated or planted evidence, denial of legal
 counsel, and expulsion of defendants from the courtroom took place. This pattern
 continued in the investigation and trial of Dodo Gugeshashvili and 12 other mem-
 bers of the paramilitary Mkhedrioni. Gugeshashvili, who was the deputy head of the
 Mkhedrioni, was tried and convicted in November on charges of banditry. She re-
 ceived a 10-year prison sentence. The trial of Jaba loseliani, the head of the
 Mkhedrioni and 14 other alleged conspirators in the 1995 assassination attempt on
 President Shevardnadze started on December 1, but it was quickly recessed andhad
 not resumed by the end of the year. The investigative stage of this trial has also
 been characterized by violations. At least one of those detained, former Security
 Service Captain Guram Papukashvili, was beaten severely, and alleged conspirators
 were held in pretrial detention for 27 months, well in excess of even the Soviet legal
 limit (see Section 1.d.).
 As part of a moratorium on capital punishment, in July President Shevardnadze
 commuted the death sentences of all 54 prisoners facing capital punishment, includ-
 ing Zarandia, Kobalia, and other Gamsakhurdia supporters, and the two men con-
 victed in 1995 of attempting to kill Jaba Koseliani. The sentences were reduced to
 20 years' imprisonment.
 Charges were finally dropped in the case of Eldar Gogoladze, a former colonel in
 the State Security Service, who was ostensibly arrested on suspicion of weapons pos-
 session, although at the time he had a permit to carry a weapon, and when police
 searched his home no weapons were found.
 Colonel Gia Korbesashvili, arrested and severely beaten in July 1995, was con-
 victed of the attempting bombing of a bridge in Tbilisi and sentenced to 12 years'
 imprisonment.
 International and local human rights groups agree that there are political pris-
 oners but disagree about the number. Russian human rights activist Sergei Kovalev
 visited 17 prisoners and detainees and concluded that all were being held for politi-
 cal reasons. Local observers disagreed with his view, noting that many of the indi-
 viduals had committed violent acts during the civil war or the period of near anar-
 chy that followed. Although these individuals, members of the Mkhedrioni,
 Gamsakhurdia supporters, and MGB personnel, may have had political objectives,
 they committed criminal acts and were tried and sentenced on criminal grounds. Ac-
 cording to some local observers there are several Gamsakhurdia supporters who
 never took up arms and should be considered political prisoners, including Nugzar
 Molodinashvili, Valter Shurgaia, Zviad Dzidziguri, and Zaur Kobalia (Loti Kobalia s
 brother). These individuals, political leaders of Gamsakhurdia's movement, were
 tried and convicted on poorly substantiated charges of treason, banditry, and illegal
 possession of weapons. They are currently serving sentences ranging from 7 to 12
 years in prison.
 Itemur Jhorjholiani, a former member of Parliament and head of the Monarchist
 Party, was pardoned by President Shevardnadze in November and released from
 prison. Jhojholiani hadbeen serving a 4-year sentence for drug possession and as-
 sault on a police officer.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution forbids the tapping of telephones and other forms of interference in an
 individual's private life without court approval or legal necessity. However, in prac-
 tice law enforcement agencies monitor private telephone conversations without ob-
 taining court orders. In June then head of the MGB, Shota Kviraia, was inves-
 tigated by Parliament for illegally tapping the telephones of journalists. During the
 parliamentary hearings in June, journalists identified tape recordings of their con-
 
 
 1090
 versations. In the wake of the scandal, Kviraia was forced to resign. State security
 police and state tax authorities also enter homes and places of work without legal
 sanction. Police regularly stop and search vehicles without probable cause to extort
 bribes. The high level of unregulated police misconduct and corruption has under-
 mined public confidence in government, especially law enforcement agencies.
 In the Gali district of Abkhazia, Abkhaz authorities periodically impress young
 Georgian males into the Abkhaz military (see Section l.a.).
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution and the 1991 press law pro-
 vide for freedom of the press; however, although the independent press was increas-
 ingly active, the Government constrained same press freedoms. According to journal-
 ists, security and law enforcement authorities attempted to intimidate the press
 through public comments and private admonitions. In May security forces beat jour-
 nalists who were reporting on a rally of Gamsakhorda supporters (see Section 2.b.).
 There is no law providing public access to government information, and government
 officials are sometimes unwilling to answer press inquiries. Journalists lack effec-
 tive legal protection, and this circumstance hinders investigative journalism.
 Some 200 independent newspapers operate, and the press increasingly serves as
 a check on government, frequently criticizing the performance of high-level officials.
 However, no independent newspapers have a national audience, although several
 have emerged as serious and reputable sources of information. The Government fi-
 nances and controls two newspapers and a radio and television network, which have
 a national audience and reflect official viewpoints. Most persons continue to get
 their news from television. The Government's monopoly on broadcast news was bro-
 ken when Rustavi-2, the Tbilisi member station of the fledgling independent tele-
 vision network, TNG, successfully resisted government attempts to shut it down.
 The Ministry of Communications revoked the station's license in 1996 and awarded
 its broadcast channel to a company with strong ties to government officials.
 Rustavi-2 eventually appealed the revocation to the Supreme Court, which directed-
 the lower court to reverse its decision and restore Rustavi-2's broadcast license. The
 station resumed broadcasting in May and again displayed independence in news
 and programming.
 The Governments near monopoly on printing and distribution was broken with
 the establishment of privately owned alternatives. However, distribution remained
 a vulnerable area. The mayor of Kutaisi, Temur Shashiashvili, issued a decree to
 establish a single distributor in Kutaisi for newspapers and magazines, reportedly
 with the intent of limiting press criticism. Independent newspapers and television
 stations continued to be harassed by state tax authorities.
 Academic freedom is widely respected.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 the right to peaceful assembly without prior permission from the authorities, and
 in practice the national and local governments generally respect this right. Par-
 liament passed a law on peaceful assembly on June 12 that incorporated these con-
 stitutional provisions. The law requires political parties and other organizations to
 give prior notice and obtain permission from localauthorities only if they intend to
 assemble on a public thoroughfare. Permits for assembly are granted without arbi-
 trary restriction or discrimination. However, government respect for freedom of as-
 sembly was lmited with respect to supporters of former President Gamsakhurdia.
 The Zviadsts, who do not recognize the legitimacy of the Government, attempted
 to hold a series of unsanctioned rallies on Tbilisi publc thoroughfares. On May 26,
 Independence Day, police and troops from the Ministry of the Interior violently
 broke up their rally. Several journalists who were reporting the event were beaten
 * by police, and a participant in the rally, Klara Shukvan, was later arrested for car-
 rying a placard "insulting" President Shevardnadze. At years end, she was being
 held in pretrial detention. The mayor of Tbilisi and the Minister of Interior publicly
 supported the actions of the police and denounced "unsanctioned rallies.' Local
 human rights groups staged a rally in June to protest the law enforcement agencies'
 excessive use of force in dispersing the rally.
 On September 24, Gamsakhurda supporters attempted to stage a rally in front
 of the university. The rally was dispersed and the events organizers, Leila Tsomaia
 and Tamila Nikoldaze, were arrested, tried, and convicted on charges of civil dis-
 order. They received prison sentences of 1 and 12/2 years respectively.
 The Constitution provides for freedom of association, and the Government re-
 spects this right in practice. Authorities grant permits for registration of associa-
 tions without arbitrary restriction or discrimination.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the
 Government respects this right in practice. Georgia has a tradition of religious toler-
 
 
 1091
 ance. However, the Georgian Orthodox Church lobbied Parliament and the Govern-
 ment for laws that would grant it special status and restrict the activities of mis-
 sionaries from "nontraditional" religions. In May the Ministry of Justice presented
 a draft of a law on religious organizations to Parliament which would have identi-
 fied "traditional" religions eligible for government assistance and support but would
 have required other religious organizations to wait 25 years to achieve such status.
 However, the bill encountered opposition, was returned to the Ministry to be rewrit-
 ten, and no further action has been taken.
 The Catholic Church and the Armenian Orthodox Church have been unable to se-
 cure the return of churches closed during the Soviet period and later given to the
 Georgian Orthodox Church. A prominent Armenian Church in Tbilisi remains
 closed, and both Churches, as is the case with Protestant denominations, have been
 unable to get permission to construct new churches, reportedly as a result of pres-
 sure from the Georgian Orthodox Church.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Constitution and the 1993 Law on Migration provide for these
 rights, and the Government generally respects them in practice. Registration of an
 individual's place of residence is no longer required, nor are internal passports. In
 principle the Government respects the right of repatriation, although approximately
 275,000 Meskhetian Turks (primarily Muslim), who were expelled from southern
 Georgia to Central Asia by Stalin in the 1940's, still face public opposition to their
 return. In December 1996, President Shevardnadze issued a decree authorizing the
 return of 1,000 Meskhetians per year for 5 years. Parliament considered and re-
 jected a law on repatriation that would have provided legal status and funding for
 Meskhetian repatriates. Since independence only 140 Meskhetians have returned to
 Georgia; 40 returned in 1997. No Meskhetians have been repatriated as a result of
 the decree; all came as illegal immigrants. The Government funds an adaptation
 center in Tbilisi where most of these individuals are housed.
 The 1994 quadripartite agreement (Russia, Georgia, Abkhazia, and the United
 Nations High Commissioner for Refugees) on repatriation in Abkhazia called for the
 free, safe, and dignified return of displaced persons and refugees to their homes.
 The Abkhaz separatist regime prevented virtually all official repatriation and uni-
 laterally abrogated the agreement in 1994. Over the past 3 years, the UNHCR esti-
 mates that more than 40,000 of the estimated 250,000 IDP's and refugees from
 Abkhazia have returned spontaneously, most to the southern part of the Gali dis-
 trict where the Abkhaz militia operate only sporadically. Returnees continue to face
 security threats from Abkhaz separatist militia, Georgian partisans, and Abkhaz
 and Georgian armed criminal bands.
 The 1992 ethnic conflict in South Ossetia also created tens of thousands IDP's and
 refugees. Ethnic Georgians from South Ossetia fled to Georgia proper and Ossetians
 from South Ossetia and other Georgian regions largely fled to Russia. The UNCR
 began a program to return the IIP's and refugees to their homes but encountered
 obstacles. The South Ossetian separatists defied attempts to repatriate ethnic Geor-
 gians to South Ossetia. For demographic reasons, they also pressed for the return
 of all Ossetian refugees to South Ossetia rather than to their original homes in
 other Georgian regions. The Government publicly recognized the right of Ossetian
 refugees to return to their homes in Georgia, but opposition persists on the local
 level, especally over the return of illegally occupied homes.
 There is no effective law concerning the settlement of refugees or the granting of
 political asylum. Georgia has so far not acced to the 1951 U.N. Convention Relat-
 ing to the Status of Refugees and its 1967 Protocol. The Government has not pro-
 vided first asylum, both because there are no legal provisions for it and because the
 matter has not yet been raised in practical terms.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 menit
 The Constitution and the 1995 election law provide citizens with the right peace-
 fully to change their overnment. Citizens exercised this right in elections in Octo-
 her 1992 and Novemer 1995. A democratically elected president and parliament
 govern most of Georgia. The 223-member Parliament and President Eduard
 Shevardnadze were elected in multiparty elections in 1995. Despite some violations,
 international observers judged these elections to meet international standards, ex-
 cept in Ajara. There was no voting in the separatist regions of Abkhazia and South
 Ossetia. President Shevardnadze's party won a majority of the seats in Parliament.
 Only two other parties qualified for representation in Parliament, but the opposition
 plays an important role in the Parliament, often leading the debate on important
 issues. The nonparliamentary opposition is also active and outspoken.
 
 
 1092
 The Government did not fulfill its commitment to hold the country's first local
 elections in 1997, while the Government and the opposition debated the structure
 of local government. The opposition called for both local councils and local executive
 branch officials to be directly elected. The Government preferred to maintain ap-
 pointed executive branch officials along with elected local councils. The Govern-
 ment's plan was passed by Parliament in September. Elements in the opposition
 began organizing a referendum on the issue, seeking to demonstrate public support
 for the election of all local officials. The referendum was rejected by the Central
 Election Commission on technical grounds. At present all local officials are ap-
 pointed by the President and are often not from the region in which they serve, lim-
 iting the scope of local self-government.
 The separatist regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia are ruled by undemocratic
 leaders. In addition the region of Ajara is to a large extent self-governing under con-
 ditions resembling a police state. Ajara's postindependence relationship to the rest
 of Georgia is still undefined, and in matters such as elections, Ajara's authorities
 claim that regional laws take precedence over national laws. The Government does
 not challenge illegal, undemocratic activity by the Ajaran authorities purportedly
 because it seeks to avoid open separatism in this ethnic Georgian, historica ly Mus-
 lim region. Ajara held regional elections in 1996 for which it denied monitoring re-
 quests from internationalas well as Georgian organizations. In addition the most
 serious violations noted during the 1995 national elections occurred in Ajara.
 Women are poorly represented in Parliament. Only 16 women were elected to Par-
 liament in 1995, and only 1 woman has been named to a ministerial post. National
 minorities are also poorly represented in Parliamsnt. There are four Armenian rep-
 resentatives and three Azeris representing populations of approximately 400,000
 and 300,000 respectively.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The Government generally respects the right of international organizations to
 monitor human rights but continues to restrict the access of local human rights
 groups to some prisoners (see Section 1.c.).
 There are several credible local organizations that monitor human rights, but
 most human rights monitoring remains politicized. The Government claims that
 most local human rights groups are extensions of partisan political groups, while
 those groups criticized the Government's human rights bodies, such as the ational
 Security Councils human rights advisor, for favoring the Government. The Par-
 liamentary Committee on Human Rights is viewed as more objective by the non-
 governmental sector. The constitutionally mandated Office of Public Human Rights
 Defender, or omsbudsman, created in 1995, was finally filled in November, when
 Parliament approved the candidacy of David Salaridze, the former bead of the State
 Revenue Service. The office is accountable neither to the Parliament nor the execu-
 tive, but at year's end it was not fully functioning as Salaridze had no staff, budget,
 or office space.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution recognizes the equality of all citizens without regard to race, lan-
 guage, sex, religion, skin color, political views, national, ethnic, or social affiliation,
 origin, social status, landownership, or place of residence. The Government len-
 erally respects these rights. The Constitution provides for Georgian as the state an-
 guage, but not all minorities in Georgia prefer to use Georgian. As a practical mat-
 ter, the approximately 400,000 Armenians and 300,000 Azeris prefer to commu-
 nicate in their own language. The Abkhaz, Ossetian, and Russian communities pre-
 fer to use Russian. Georgian and Russian are beth used for interethnic communica-
 tion.
 Women.-Women's nongovernmental organizations (NGO's), including the Wom-
 en's Group of the Georgian Young Lawyer's Association (GYLA) and Women for De-
 mocracy, have been formed to promote women's rights. These organizations report
 that spousal abuse usually goes unreported, and therefore uninvestigated, as many
 women are unaware of their legal rights. Spousal abuse reportedly is one of the
 leading causes of divorce. GYLAs women's group set up a hotline to provide counsel-
 ing for women, and plans to open a shelter for battered women. The Government
 has no support services for abused women. Sexual harassment is reportedly a prob-
 lem in the workplace and is not investigated. Police do not always investigate re-
 ports of rape. There are no laws concerning trafficking in women.
 Women's access to the labor market is improving but remains primarily confined,
 particularly for older women, to low-paying and low-skill positions, frequently de-
 
 
 1093
 
 spite high professional and academic qualifications. Equal pay for equal work is gen-
 erally respected, but reportedly men are given preference in promotions.
 Children.-Government services for children are extremely limited. The 1995
 Health Reform Act withdrew free health care for children over the age of 1 year.
 While education is officially free, many parents are unable to afford books and
 school supplies, and most parents have to pay for their children's education.
 The Georgian private voluntary organization Child and Environment noted a dra-
 matic rise in homeless children following the collapse of the Soviet Union. It esti-
 mates that there are more than 1,000 street children in Thilisi due to the inability
 of orphanages and the Government to provide support. Child and Environment re-
 ported that during the winter, street children die of e osure. The organization
 opened a shelter that can only accommodate a small number of the street children.
 The children increasingly survive by turning to criminal activity, narcotics, and
 prostitution. Despite the cultural tradition of protecting children, the Government
 has taken little official action to assist street children due to a lack of resources.
 People With Disabilities.-There is no legislative or otherwise mandated provision
 requiring accessibility for the disabled. The Law on Labor has a section that in-
 cludes the provision of special discounts and favorable social policies for those with
 disabilities, especially disabled veterans.
 Many of the state facilities for the disabled that operated in the Soviet period
 have been closed because of lack of government funding. Most disabled persons are
 supported by family members or by international humanitarian donations.
 Religious Minorities.-The Government generally respects the rights of religious
 minorities. However, the Georgian Orthodox Church sought special status from the
 Government (see Section 2.c.) and tried to hinder evangelical missionaries and the
 Salvation Army. Foreign Christian missionaries, particularly evangelicals, continued
 to report incidents of harassment on the part of Orthodox priests and their support-
 ers. A March worship meeting of the Salvation Army in Rustavi was disrupted by
 a crowd led by 10 Orthodox priests. The Patriarchy publicly denounced the Salva-
 tion Army, calling it a satanic organization. The Georgian Orthodox Church has ar-
 gued that foreign Christian missionaries should confine their activities to non-Chris-
 tian areas.
 Organizations promoting the rights of Jews and Jewish emigration continue to re-
 port that the Government provides good cooperation and support. Jewish leaders at-
 tribute isolated acts of anti-Semitism in previous years, including the publication of
 anti-Semitic newspaper articles and the destruction of Jewish communal property,
 to general instability and disorder. The Government has been outspoken in denounc-
 ing anti-Semitism. The editor of the independent newspaper Noi received a 3-year
 prison sentence and publication of the newspaper was suspended following publica-
 tion of a virulently anti-Semitic article in 1996.
 The Jewish community publishes and distributes a newspaper without any prob-
 lems. However, the Jewish community also experienced delay in the return of prop-
 erty confiscated during Soviet rule. A former synagogue, rented from the Govern-
 ment by a theater group, was ordered by the courts to be returned to the Jewish
 community in April The theater group refused to comply and started a publicity
 campaign with anti-Semitic overtones to justify its continued occupation of the
 building. In August the mayor of Tbilisi gave the campaign implicit support by re-
 versing a previous city government decision that also called for the return of the
 building, but at year's end there had been no resolution of the issue.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-The Government generally respects the
 rights of members of ethnic minorities in nonconflict areas but limits self-govern-
 ment in the ethnic Armenian and Azeri enclaves (see Section 3). The Government
 provides insufficient funds for schools in these areas but allows instruction in non-
 Gorgian languages. Violence in Abkhazia and South Ossetia reflects historic ethnic
 tensions and the legacy of Soviet policy, which was designed to pit ethnic minorities
 against one another.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution and the April Law on Trade
 Unions provide for the right of citizens to form and join unions.
 The principal trade union is the Amalgamated Trade Unions of Georgia (ATUG).
 The ATUG is the successor to the official union that existed during the Soviet pe-
 riod. The union broke from the central Soviet labor union in 1989. Its present struc-
 ture was established in 1995, after the union had resisted efforts first by the
 Gamsakhurdia Government and later by the State Council to bring the union under
 government control. The ATUG consists of 29 sectoral unions. Its leadership was in-
 directly elected for a period of 5 years in 1995 by representatives to the ATUG con-
 gress that year. The organization officially claims 1.2 million members, but acknowl-
 
 
 1094
 edges that the number of active, dues-paying members is considerably fewer. The
 union has no affiliation with the Government and receives no government funding.
 The union sees its primary role as defending the economic and social interests of
 workers, a departure from its Soviet predecessor, which was essentially an adminis-
 trative body concerned with property and finance rather than with worker rights.
 The ATUG organized strikes in the manganese and coal mining industries and
 teachers' strikes in several locations. In each case, the issue was unpaid wages.
 There was no retaliation against workers who struck.
 There are no legal prohibitions against affiliation and participation in inter-
 national organizations. The ATUG works closely with the International Confed-
 eration of Free Trade Unions.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The Constitution and the
 Law on Trade Unions allow workers to organize and bargain collectively, and this
 right is respected. The law prohibits antiunion discrimination by employers against
 union members. Employers may be prosecuted for antiunion discrimination and be
 made to reinstate employees and pay back wages. The Ministry of Labor inves-
 tigates complaints but is not staffed to conduct effective investigations.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsor Labor.-The Constitution prohibits forced
 or compulsory labor and provides or sanctions against violatrs. Violations are rare;
 there is no bonded or forced child labor. The Ministry of Labor enforces this law.
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment.-The Con-
 stitution prohibits forced or compulsory labor, and it is not known to occur. The
 Government prohibits forced and bonded labor by children and enforces this prohibi-
 tion effectively (see Section 6.c.). According to current legislation, the minimum age
 for employment of children is 16 years; however, in exceptional cases, the minimum
 age can be 14 years. The Ministry of Labor enforces these laws, and they are gen-
 erally respected.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The nationally mandated minimum wage was
 abolished in 1995 and replaced by a wage scale that sets salaries for various grades
 in the public sector, the lowest of which is approximately $10 (13 lari) per month.
 There is no state-mandated minimum wage for private sector workers. Pensions and
 salaries are usually insufficient to meet basic minimum needs.
 The law provides for a 41-hour workweek and for a 24-hour rest period. The gov-
 ernment workweek is often shortened during the winter due to the continuing en-
 ergy crisis. The Labor Code permits higher wages for hazardous work and permits
 a worker in such fields to refuse duties that could endanger life.
