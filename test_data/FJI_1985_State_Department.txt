 FIJI
 Fiji is a multiracial society of 700,000 citizens made up of
 indigenous Melanesians/Polynesians (43.4 percent), ethnic
 Indians (51 percent), and European, Chinese, and other Pacific
 Islanders (5.6 percent). It has a bicameral parliamentary
 system inherited from the British colonial period which ended
 in 1970. Its Constitution provides safeguards to protect
 traditional communal social systems, including land tenure
 rights of the indigenous Fijians.
 The individual civil and political rights of Fiji's citizens
 are protected by law, a court system which functions
 effectively and rapidly, a free press, free democratic
 elections, and a government which supports cultural diversity.
 Basic human rights such as free association and the right to:
 own private property are enshrined in law and observed in
 practice.
 Fiji is a developing country whose main industries are sugar
 refining and tourism. Industrial development is proceeding
 primarily through the expansion of light manufacturing.
 During 1985 Fiji continued its excellent human rights
 performance.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 Politically motivated killing by the Government or opposition
 political organizations is unknown.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no disappearances in 1985 nor was there any evidence
 of people being abducted, secretly arrested, or clandestinely
 detained.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 -Torture, prohibited by law under the Constitution, is not
 practiced. Cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or
 punishment is illegal and neither condoned nor practiced.
 There are no summary executions. Treatment of prisoners is
 impartial and humane. In addition to constitutional
 prohibitions, Legal Notice No. 51 contains specific regulations
 on treatment, visiting rights, clothing, etc., which are
 respected in practice. Prisons remain overcrowded, but
 prisoners can serve their time and live outside the prison
 environment for the last 12 months of sentence and for any
 sentence of 12 months or less. Legislation also allows gainful
 employment, in addition to commitment to perform public work,
 while serving extramural sentences. Public defenders are
 available, and the Fiji Red Cross has access to detainees.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Habeas corpus exists and is honored in practice, and there is
 no preventive detention. In addition to constitutional
 safeguards, Legal Notice No. 14 establishes detailed rules to
 
 
 768
 FIJI
 be followed by the police during arrests. A suspect can be
 held no more than 24 hours without charge following arrest.
 Exile is not practiced.
 Fiji does not permit the use of forced or compulsory labor and
 there have been no reports of either practice.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Public trial is guaranteed by law and honored in practice.
 Defendants are entitled to counsel, and counselors have free
 access to defendants. Defendants are made fully aware of the
 charges brought against them, and they and their lawyers have
 access to the evidence upon which charges are based. Fiji's
 courts are independent of executive or military control. There
 are no special courts and civilians are not tried by military
 courts.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The sanctity of the home is respected. Warrants issued by a
 magistrate are required for officials to enter a private
 residence. There is no arbitrary intrusion by the state or
 political organizations into the private life of the individual.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Freedom of speech and press are guaranteed by the Constitution
 and observed in practice. The press is free and private and
 not censored or controlled by the Government. However, Fiji
 inherited an ordinance from the Colonial Administration which
 allows the Government to order a correction in the press if the
 Government believes it has been misrepresented. This
 ordinance, though very seldom used, is resented by the press
 since it requires giving equal space and equal placement to the
 Government's statement. There is no interference with academic
 inquiry.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 There are no impediments to assembly or to freedom of
 association, although an ordinance requires obtaining a permit
 one week in advance of any picketing or public demonstration.
 Fiji has an active trade union movement, recognized by the
 Government, which has the right to organize, strike, bargain
 collectively, and lobby. Fiji's 50 trade unions have about
 45,000 members. Unions must give a 28-Aay notice of intent
 before going out on strike in the public sector. Fiji's
 largest trade union confederation is associated with the
 International Confederation of Free Trade Unions and
 participates in conferences-of the International Labor
 Organization.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 All religions are tolerated and allowed to practice freely.
 There is no dominant religion in Fiji, nor is any singled out
 for discrimination. Evangelical religions are free to seek
 converts and actively do so.

 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 All Fiji citizens are free to travel anywhere within the
 country and abroad. There are no restrictions on
 repatriation. There are no displaced persons in Fiji.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Fiji's political structure is designed to accommodate the
 special interests of the ethnic Fijians and of the ethnic
 Indian community. Election to the House of Representatives is
 on the basis of communal and national rolls. House elections
 are free and democratic, and many parties contest the seats.
 In Fiji's most recent national elections, 84.4 percent of the
 voting-age population participated. Members of the Senate are
 appointed by the Fiji Council of Chiefs, the Prime Minister,
 and the leader of the opposition.
 Fiji's court system has tried, and in some cases convicted,
 persons charged with voting fraud, including a member of the
 governing party.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigations of Alleged
 Violations of Human Rights
 There have been no reported allegations of human rights
 violations by the Fiji Government nor any known requests for
 investigations. Fiji's Ombudsman investigates complaints
 against the Government while maintaining the confidentiality of
 the complainant. A free, independent, and competitive press
 also serves as a watchdog for human rights. There are no
 adverse consequences associated with actions of either of these
 institutions. The 1985 Amnesty International Report did not
 contain an entry on Fiji. Freedom House rates it as "free."
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 In 1985 Fiji's population was 700,000 and the growth rate 2
 percent. The economy is divided between a subsistence
 agriculture and a cash-based economy, the former characteristic
 of the outlying islands and the latter typical of the group's
 two main islands. Although the per capita gross national
 product is relatively high for a developing nation at $1,790
 (World Bank figures for 1983), the country's wealth is not
 evenly distributed between the urban and rural sectors. In
 1985, 30 percent of the rural population fell below the
 absolute poverty level. Fiji seeks to increase economic
 opportunities through regional planning and economic
 incentives. Its most recent development plans have called for
 increased attention to agriculture and rural development
 programs and the commitment of resources to improve housing,
 nutrition, health services, and education in the rural areas.
 Health care has been expanded with an emphasis on preventive
 medicine. Fiji's infant mortality rate declined from 36.6 per
 1,000 in 1982 to 23.1 in 1985. Life expectancy at birth is
 66.96. The percentage of the population with access to safe
 water has risen dramatically in the last decade. In 1980
 statistics showed 77 percent of the population had access to
 safe water (94 percent urban, 66 percent rural). Fiji's rich
 soil and tropical climate combine to give its people an
 
 
 770
 FIJI
 adequate diet. The ratio of calorie supply relative to
 nutritional requirements was estimated by the World Bank at 131
 percent in the 1980-1982 period.
 Three-quarters of the population are literate. Almost all
 Fijians are bilingual in English and either Fijian or
 Hindustani. Virtually all primary-age children are enrolled in
 school, as are 90 percent of secondary school-age children.
 The total primary school enrollment ratio in 1981 was 116.05
 (117.73 male, 115.93 female).
 Worker rights in Fiji are protected under several pieces of
 industrial legislation. No child under age 12 may be employed
 in any capacity. Children (persons under age 15) and "young
 persons" (age 15 but under age 18) may not be employed in any
 capacity which is hazardous to health, dangerous, or otherwise
 unsuitable. Children are forbidden to be employed in industry
 or in attendance on machinery. With some exceptions, women and
 young persons may not be employed in industry between 6 p.m.
 and 6 a.m. There is no national minimum wage; however, several
 statutory and nonstatutory bodies have been established to set
 minimum wages by sector. Fiji's Employment Act protects
 workers from summary dismissal without just cause. A Workmen's
 Compensation Act and an accident compensation plan have been
 enacted to set safety standards in the workplace and establish
 guidelines for compensation for workers injured on the job.
 Some unions in Fiji have criticized employers and the
 Government for failing to take action to remedy unsafe working
 conditions after they have been notified of them by the
 unions. The largest number of such allegations have been made
 in connection with Fiji's sugar industry, the largest and most
 "industrialized" sector of the economy.
 The Government neither condones nor encourages discrimination
 based on sex, race, or religion. The Constitution states that
 "every person in Fiji is entitled to the fundamental rights and
 freedoms of the individual, that is to say, the right
 regardless of race, place of origin, political opinions, color,
 creed or sex..." There is a growing awareness among women of
 both the Fijian and Indian communities of their right to
 participate more actively in social and political endeavors.
 However, women in rural areas continue to fill the traditional
 roles of village life and few women hold high-level business or
 political positions. Tribal inheritance is usually based on a
 patriarchal system. Women can and do, however, inherit status
 as chiefs; Fiji's third highest ranking chief is a woman.
 About 85 percent of the land in Fiji is owned communally by the
 indigenous Fijian people. Approximately 6 percent is
 government land, leaving less than 10 percent as freehold
 land. Communal and government lands can be leased but not
 sold; only freehold land can be purchased outright. The
 arrangement regarding land ownership was instituted to protect
 the interests of indigenous Fijians from the more economically
 competitive Indo-Fijians, but some of the latter consider it
 discriminatory and an interference with their own freedom to
 develop. Some members of the Indian community also complain
 that it is difficult for them to obtain government-backed
 financing for investment projects.

 FIJI
 Indo-Fijians have generally experienced greater success in the
 pursuit of educational studies and in the accumulation of
 wealth through investment in private enterprise. Most
 businesses in Fiji are owned and operated by Indo-Fijians, and
 they are more heavily represented in the civil service. Some
 indigenous Fijians view the concentration of Indo-Fijians in
 business and government as discriminatory to their own racial
 group.
