 ANTIGUA AND BARBUDA
 Antigua and Barbuda is a small two-island state with a
 parliamentary democracy modeled after that of the United
 Kingdom. It is governed by a prime minister, a cabinet, and a
 legislative assembly. The Governor General, with largely
 ceremonial duties, is the titular head of state.
 The Constitution requires general elections at least every 5
 years. Prime Minister V. C. Bird and his Antigua Labour Party
 won an overwhelming victory in the 1984 general elections,
 capturing all 16 parliamentary seats in Antigua. The one
 opposition member of Parliament is the member representing
 Barbuda, who is nominally a political independent.
 Security forces consist of a police force and the Antigua and
 Barbuda defense force, a 120-man infantry unit. The police
 are organized, trained, and supervised according to British
 law enforcement practices. The security forces have a good
 reputation for respecting individual rights in the performance
 of their duties.
 Antigua and Barbuda has a mixed economy, with a strong private
 sector. Tourism is the major industry. In 1988 the economy
 registered a 7 percent increase in gross domestic product, the
 fourth straight year of high growth. External debt, however,
 continued to grow at a worrisome rate.
 Antigua and Barbuda's generally good human rights record
 remained largely unchanged in 1988. The Constitution provides
 for political and civil rights, including the freedoms of
 speech and press, which are generally respected in practice,
 with the exception that opposition parties have little or no
 access to the government-dominated electronic media.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There were no reports of political killings.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reports of disappearances or politically
 motivated abductions.
 c. Torture and*Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 The Constitution prohibits torture and other cruel or inhuman
 treatment of prisoners or detainees and these prohibitions are
 respected in practice.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The Constitution prohibits arbitrary arrest and detention,
 which do not occur in practice. Criminal defendants are
 guaranteed the right of judicial determination of the legality
 of their detention. Detainees must be brought before a court
 within 48 hours of arrest or detention. There were no reports
 of involuntary exil6.

 With regard to forced or compulsory labor, see Section 6.c.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Antigua and Barbuda's judicial system is modeled on that of
 the United Kingdom and is part of the Eastern Caribbean legal
 system. Final appeal may be made to the Queen's Privy Council
 in the United Kingdom and is invariably made in the case of
 death sentences. There are no military or political courts.
 Criminal defendants are assured a fair, open, and public
 trial. In capital cases the Government provides legal
 assistance at public expense to persons without means to
 retain a private attorney. There are no political prisoners
 in Antigua and Barbuda.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The leader of the major opposition party has claimed that his
 mail was routinely opened before delivery. No evidence to
 support his assertion has been made public, and the Government
 has not responded to questions about it. There have been no
 other reports of arbitrary police or government actions
 against a person's home, family, or privacy. The police must
 obtain a warrant before searching private premises.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution provides for freedom of speech, the press,
 and other forms of communication; these provisions are
 generally respected. However, the Government dominates the
 electronic media, which is the only source of daily news. The
 Government owns one of the two radio staLions and the single
 television station, and the Prime Minister's family owns the
 second radio station. Opposition politicians have not been
 able to obtain air time to present their positions. ABS radio
 and television report regularly on the activities of the
 ruling party but rarely on those of the opposition. Criticism
 of the Government appearing in wire service regional reports
 is not aired in Antigua.
 Weekly newspapers representing the opposition publish a
 variety of opinions. They are free to criticize the
 Government and do so regularly. Religious organizations also
 publish their own newspapers.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Constitution provides for the right of peaceful assembly.
 Public meetings and organized demonstrations are held without
 police interference. The required permits for public meetings
 are routinely granted.
 For a discussion of freedom of association as it applies to
 labor unions, see Section 6.a.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 There is unrestricted exercise of religious freedom. The
 population is overwhelmingly Protestant, but adherents of
 other religious denominations proselytize openly without
 government interference. All groups are free to maintain
 links with coreligionists in other countries.

 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Neither law nor practice restricts the right of citizens of
 Antigua and Barbuda to move about within the country, to
 travel abroad, or to emigrate.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Antigua and Barbuda has a multiparty political system
 accommodating widely divergent views. All citizens 18 years
 of age and older may register and vote by secret ballot. The
 Constitution requires general elections at least every 5
 years. Individual parties conduct voter registration drives
 free from government interference. The Government is
 obligated by law to hold voter registration during a fixed
 period each year.
 The Antigua Labour Party (ALP) led by Prime Minister V. C.
 Bird Sr. has been in power since 1951, except for a period in
 opposition from 1971 to 1976. The 1984 elections, conducted
 fairly and openly, resulted in the ALP winning every
 constituency in Antigua. In Barbuda, an independent who
 rarely disagrees with the Government, won the sole seat and
 became the Government's only parliamentary opposition.
 In 1988 the opposition continued energetic attacks on
 government policies but asserted that the ALP's longstanding
 monopoly on patronage and its influence on the economic life
 of the country make it extremely difficult for an opposition
 party to attract membership and financial support. On the
 smaller island of Barbuda, with less than 2 percent of the
 country's total population, separatist sentiments remain
 strong.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights .
 Internationally recognized human rights organizations have not
 expressed concern about Antigua and Barbuda. There were no
 requests for human rights investigations or inquiries during
 1988.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Law and practice prohibit discrimination based on race, sex,
 creed, language, or social status. The role of women in
 society is not restricted by law, but tradition tends to limit
 women to home and family, particularly in rural areas. As
 elsewhere in the region, these traditional roles are
 changing. The Government has begun programs to provide
 enhanced educational opportunities for both sexes as well as
 family planning services. Under the energetic prodding of the
 Government's "Women's Desk," women are moving up in government
 and the professions, but more slowly in the private sector.

 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Workers have the right to associate freely and to form labor
 unions. Although fewer than 50 percent of Antigua and
 Barbuda's workers belong to unions, the important hotel
 industry is heavily unionized. Unions are free to affiliate
 with international labor organizations and do so in practice.
 Antigua and Barbuda has two major trade unions: the Antigua
 Trade and Labour Union (ATLU) and the Antigua Workers' Union
 (AWU). The ATLU is associated with the ruling ALP, while the
 AWU is allied with the opposition United National Democratic
 Party. -During 1988 the ATLU did not hesitate to criticize
 government policies and practices with which it disagreed.
 The right to strike is recognized by the Labor Code. This
 right can be limited in a given dispute by the Court of
 Industrial Relations. Once either party to the dispute
 requests the Court to mediate, there can be no strike until
 the Court has reached a decision. Because of the delays
 associated with this process, in practice labor disputes are
 often resolved before a strike is called.
 b. The Right To Organize and Dargain Collectively
 Labor organizations are free to organize and bargain
 collectively. There are no areas of the country where union
 organization or collective bargaining is discouraged or
 impeded.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 The Constitution forbids slavery and forced labor, which do
 not exist in practice.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 The law provides a minimum working age of 13, which is
 respected in practice.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 The workweek is 40 hours in 5 days. Workers are guaranteed a
 minimum of 3 weeks annual leave and up to 13 weeks of
 maternity leave. There are no occupational health and safety
 laws or regulations. Different minimum wages for different
 professions were established by law in 1981. Most such
 minimum wages would not provide a decent standard of living
 for workers and their families, but the great majority of
 workers earn much more than the minimum wage. A committee is
 reviewing these minimum wages, which are expected to be raised
 substantially. Some representative minimum hourly wages at
 the present: household domestics $0.50; unskilled laborers
 $0.61, construction workers $0.93; skilled workers $1.30.
