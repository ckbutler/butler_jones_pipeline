 FRANCE
 France is a democratic republic with constitutional provisions for human rights,
 freely functioning political parties, regular elections, and universal suffrage.
 The military and security apparatus consists of the three traditional military
 services, a 91,000-strong gendarmerie (national police/paramilitary force), and police
 forces in major cities. These forces are under civilian control and generally are high-
 ly professional.
 
 
 871
 France has a developed and diversified economy and a skilled labor force. It has
 substantial agricultural resources and a modern industrial system based on a mix-
 ture of public and private enterprises.
 The authorities generally respect human rights and civil liberties, which are pro-
 vided for by the 1958 Constitution. Instances of individual wrongdoing by police or
 other officials are generally investigated and dealt with according to law. Respon-
 sibility for encouraging respect for human rights in France and its overseas depart-
 ments and territories is shared among several senior officials, including the Minister
 of State for Social and Urban Affairs; the Minister of Foreign Affairs; and the Min-
 ister-Delegate for Humanitarian Action and Human Rights.
 The Government has consistently condemned and pursued perpetrators of spo-
 radic acts of violence against ethnic and religious minorities and of discrimination
 against such groups.
 In 1993 a lively debate arose over how best to control illegal immigration while
 preserving fundamental human rights and civil liberties. The final text of the con-
 stitutional amendment (ratified in November) to accomplish this reform preserves
 the basic right to political asylum. However, under its terms the Government will
 no longer be obligated to review requests from individuals whose applications have
 already been reviewed and rejected by other European Community members that
 have signed the intergovernmental Shengen Accord aimed at promoting the free
 movement of people among the signatory countries. ome human rights groups, in-
 cluding the French chapter of Amnesty International, criticized the removal of the
 obligation to consider all requests for political asylum.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-French authorities do not engage in
 political killing. In instances of extrajudicial killing from excessive use of force,
 there are well-established means for legal redress. In April there were three in-
 stances in which police officers apparently used excessive force in the shootings of
 three minority suspects, two of which resulted in fatalities. In these cases, one po-
 liceman was charged with involuntary manslaughter one with voluntary man-
 slaughter, and the other remains under investigation. 4one of these three cases was
 concluded by year's end.
 b. Disappearance.-French authorities do not engage in abduction or secret ar-
 rests.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Torture or cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment are forbidden by
 law and are generally prosecuted. In the occasional instances of alleged police bru-
 tality, administrative and judicial mechanisms exist for determining guilt and pun-
 ishing transgressors.
 The Council of Europe Commission on the Prevention of Torture released a report
 in January urging the Government to tighten its procedures to protect those in cus-
 tody. The study, conducted in 1991 with the Government's cooperation, found that
 suspects ran a "not inconsiderable risk of being mistreated" while in police deten-
 tion. According to the report, mistreatment included such abuse as detainees being
 struck by fists, subjected to psychological pressure, and denied food or medicine. At
 the same time, the Commission said that it found no indications of serious mistreat-
 ment or torture. The report also criticized two prisons, at Nice and Baumettes, for
 being overcrowded and lacking activity programs. It concluded that prison condi-
 tions were inhuman and degrading. The Government responded that, since the re-
 port's release, it had reduced overcrowding at both prisons and had opened a new
 prison near Nice.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-French law provides for freedom from ar-
 bitrary arrest and imprisonment. No direct equivalent of habeas corpus exists in the
 legal system, but cases must be referred to a magistrate for investigation within 4
 days; 2 days for drug and terrorism cases.
 A Penal Code introduced in 1993 is intended to strengthen the rights of the de-
 fendants. Under the Code, suspects are required to be informed of their rights in
 a language they understand. The Government published an explanatory brochure in
 eight languages to be given to those in custody. The Code guarantees a suspect the
 right of immediate access to a physician and access to an attorney within 20 hours,
 immediately in the case of those below the age of 16. Pretrial confinement in the
 case of felonies is not limited. This pretrial period can be lengthy, depending upon
 the seriousness and complexity of the case. Evidence is gathered and assessed by
 an independent examining judge. Defendants are free to request and present evi-
 dence during this investigatory period.
 
 
 872
 The judiciary plays a determining role in the detention process. French authori-
 ties are not reported to have detained any person for political reasons. No provisions
 for exile exists.
 French judicial practice in narcotics cases commonly assesses a "customs fine" in
 addition to a jail sentence. These fines are based on estimates of the "value" of the
 contraband and tend to exceed by far any financial assets of the convicted smuggler.
 Upon conclusion of the mandated jail sentence, a prisoner is not released unless he
 has paid the fine. Those who cannot pay the fne--the bulk of those affected-are
 then kept in detention under a legal stipulation that might reasonably be considered
 arbitrary. The length of the detention is not specific but depends on the whims of
 customs officials, who use the threat of continued detention to extract the largest
 possible partial settlement from the detained prisoner and his or her family. The
 upper limit of such detention is 2 years.
 e. Denial of Fair Public TriaL.-The right to fair public trial is provided by law
 and respected in practice. The new Pena Code reinforced the presumption of inno-
 cence by introducing several major innovations. The concept of indictment, which in
 France was often incorrectly viewed as synonymous with guilt, was abandoned. Fur-
 ther, should the State determine that there is insufficient evidence to bring charges,
 a suspect may demand publication of that decision in newspapers or on television.
 For misdemeanors, pretrial confinement-which is very rare-is limited normally
 to 4 months, with extensions in special circumstances of approximately 8 to 12
 months. Although all drug-related crimes are technically classified as misdemean-
 ors, those convicted of serious narcotics offenses are subject to penalties otherwise
 reserved for felonies.
 Those found guilty of some drug offenses may be sentenced to up to 20 years' im-
 prisonment. Trials are normally open and public, but provisions exist for the defense
 to request a closed proceeding. All felonies are tried before juries, and a defendant
 does not have the right to refuse a jury trial. The press has free access to records
 of court proceedings, although the prosecutor may not disclose information about
 cases being tried or investigated.
 French law provides for the right of appeal for those convicted of misdemeanors.
 Those convicted of felonies may appeal to the Court of Cassation only on procedural
 grounds.
 The 1992 Country Report cited a case in which the former National Assembly
 President was accused of influence peddling in his former capacity as Socialist Party
 treasurer. The official subsequently filed suit against the judge, claiming that the
 indictment was politically motivated. That case had not been heard at year's end;
 the official was reelected to public office.
 France has no political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-French
 law provides for freedom from invasion of privacy, and this freedom is respected in
 practice. The search of a private residence may be carried out by police if there is
 reason to believe a crime is taking place within. The search may be carried out only
 between 6 a.m. and 9 p.m., except in special circumstances, such as in drug cases,
 when the search may be undertaken at any time. Telephone conversations may be
 monitored by authority of a court order in conjunction with criminal proceedings.
 However, no court order is required in national security cases.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-Freedom of speech and press are guaranteed
 by law and respected in practice. Newspapers and magazines are free of government
 control and present views ranging across the political spectrum. Under French law,
 high government officials may seek to sue media representatives for defamation. In
 practice, this provision is rarely invoked and does not interfere with free expression.
 There are three state-owned and three private television networks in addition to
 private cable channels. Hundreds of private radio stations offer a wide array of inde-
 pendent, uncensored programming in French and several other languages. No cen-
 sorship of books or other publications occurs. Academic freedom of expression is re-
 spected in both public and private academic institutions.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-Freedom of peaceful assembly
 and association is widely respected, although-except for a specific reference to
 trade unions--it is not mentioned in the Constitution. Groups wishing to organize
 public meetings, protest marches, or demonstrations must declare their intent to do
 so to local authorities. Normally these authorities raise no objection to either politi-
 cal or nonpolitical gatherings. While the decision to deny permission for a dem-
 onstration rests within the discretion of local officials, a denial may be appealed to
 the Council of State. Private associations, whether political or apolitical, must reg-
 ister with the prefecture in the department in which they are established, but they
 
 
 873
 do not require the prefecture's authorization to exist. Such registration is considered
 routine in France. Informal associations, such as those without officers, bylaws, or
 dues, need not register.
 c. Freedom of Religin.-All religions are tolerated. Roman Catholics are by far
 the ]ageat religious group. Separation of church and state is guaranteed by law,
 although both private and parochial schools receive substantial subsidies from the
 Ministry of National Education. In keeping with the secular nature of French public
 school, it is forbidden to wear religious symbols. This law conflicts with the desire
 of some Muslim girls to wear headscarves, and four girls were denied entry to one
 school for insisting on wearing the scarves. Some Muslim groups consequently
 claimed that the girls were being denied the right to practice their religion.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The law provides for freedom of internal movement, foreign travel, emi-
 gration, and repatriation. All lawful resident aliens, including refugees, may under-
 take foreign travel and, in most instances, return to France.
 France has a long history as a haven for refugees and political asylum seekers.
 Thus, there was considerable debate concerning a proposed law designed to control
 illegal immigration. A key element of the law would have permitted France to refuse
 asylum requests from individuals whose cases had previously been reviewed and
 found without merit by other European Community signatories of the Schengen Ac-
 cord. After the Constitutional Court ruled in August that this measure was uncon-
 stitutional, the Government decided to initiate a revision that will preserve the
 basic right of political asylum  while bringing the Constitution in line with the
 Schengen Accord. The revision was adopted by the French Government in Novem-
 ber.
 In another action reflecting France's growing concern about illegal immigration
 and asylum abuse, the Government approved a law in May amending France's na-
 tionality code. The measure restricts the right of those born in France of non-French
 parents to claim French citizenship. Previous law provided that citizenship be im-
 mediately accorded to those born in France when they turned 18. Under the new
 law, which applies retroactively to those born before its enactment, applicants will
 have to apply for citizenship when they are between 16 and 21 years of age. It is
 expected that the new provision will be largely a bureaucratic formality, except for
 those applicants who have been convicted of major crimes and could thereby be
 ruled ineligible for citizenship.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 French citizens have the right and ability to change their government by peaceful
 means, not only through the election of the President, the National Assembly, and
 local officials, but also through amendment of the Constitution by means of national
 referendum.
 While the French do not entirely accept the notion of "indigenous" peoples, an at-
 tempt is made to take local traditions into account within the administration of
 some French overseas territories where distinct ethnic groups have preserved such
 traditions and customs.
 Varying special statutes--applicable to all citizens resident within the respective
 territories, regardless of ethnic origin-govern the "collective territory" of Mayotte
 and the territories of French Polynesia, Wallis and Futuna, and New Caledonia. The
 citizens of these territories determine their legal and political relationships to
 France by means of referendums.
 In spite of differences in their respective administrative statutes-and resulting
 differences in local government entities--French citizens within the territories par-
 ticipate fully in the political process, electing both deputies and senators to the
 French Parliament. All French citizens who have reached the age of 18 may vote,
 except for most convicted criminals, bankrupt persons, and persons certified to be
 mentally incompetent. These provisions are fully respected in practice.
 Within France itself, the Government has over the years granted greater local au-
 tonomy to the Basques and to Corsica, while resisting isolated calls for independ-
 ence.
 The French President (who serves as Head of State) is directly elected every 7
 years through a system of universal suffrage. France has a bicameral parliamentary
 system with a National Assembly and a Senate. Representatives to the National As-
 sembly are directly elected every 5 years, unless the Government is dissolved, in
 which case elections may be calned sooner. Senators are elected through a system
 of indirect elections and serve 9-year terms. Voting is by secret ballot. The Prime
 Minister (Head of Government) is selected from the parliamentary majority by the
 President.
 
 
 874
 France has an open multiparty system. National legislative elections in March re-
 placed the Socialist government, elected in 1988, with a center-right coalition. A
 wide variety of political parties compete freely in regularly scheduled national and
 local elections. Many special interest groups--business, labor, veterans, consumer
 advocates, ecologists, and others-organize freely and regularly support candidates
 for elective office.
 There are no restrictions in law on the participation of women in government and
 olitics. Women are active in all facets of French politics but political and social tra-
 dition has resulted in lower percentages of women than men being elected to public
 office, especially at the national level. In 1993, 3 of 30 cabinet members, 16 of 320
 senators, and 35 of 573 deputies in the lower house were women. In an effort to
 advance women's political prospects, some parties have established quotas to guar-
 antee women a certain number of positions on electoral lists or in party manage-
 ment.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 A wide variety of local and international human rights organizations operate free-
 ly in France. The French National Consultative Commission on Human Rights,
 which monitors complaints and advises the Government on policies and legislation,
 is an independent body within the Prime Minister's Office.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 Statutes ban discrimination based on race, religion, sex, ethnic background, or po-
 litical opinion.
 Women.-The Government strongly condemns and vigorously attempts to prevent
 violence and abuse against women, and such violence, including wife beating, is pro-
 hibited under the Penal Code. In 1992 a law was added to the Code providing pen-
 alties of up to 1 year in prison and up to approximately $20,000 in fines for super-
 visors convicted of sexually harassing employees.
 While the law requires that women receive equal pay for equal work, this require-
 ment is not met in many cases. Women's rights groups actively lobby for full imple-
 mentation of equal rights statutes and seek solutions to the increasingly publicized
 phenomenon of violence against women.
 Children.-The Government devotes a significant portion of its expenditures to
 children's welfare. In addition to direct expenditures or health and education, it as-
 sists families with children through a number of allowances. Some, but not all, al-
 lowances are based on family income. There are strict laws against child abuse, par-
 ticularly when committed by a parent or guardian. Associations exist to help minors
 seek justice in cases of mistreatment by parents.
 Under a law that prohibits harming children, the Government has brought crimi-
 nal charges against those who perform female genital mutilation, Over the past 10
 years, there have been 15 trials involving more than 30 families. In November the
 Government launched a public information campaign against the practice, which in-
 cluded hanging posters in maternity clinics, doctors' offices, social centers, and pub-
 lic housing that warned female sexual mutilation is punishable by imprisonment.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-Anti-immigrant sentiment continued to pro-
 voke incidents of racism, including occasional attacks by "skinheads', directed at the
 large Arab/Muslim and black African immigrant communities, as well as at the Jew-
 ish population. The Government and a wide spectrum of public opinion have consist-
 ently condemned such incidents. The law since 1991 has required that the National
 Consultative Commission on Human Rights publish an annual report on "'he
 Struggle Against Racism and Xenophobia. According to the latest report, issued in
 March, that polls indicated that 89 percent of French citizens interviewed believed
 that racial discrimination was a "fairly" or "very" widespread problem in France.
 The report also found, however, that the actual number of racial and anti-Semitic
 attacks had fallen in comparison with the previous year.
 In September the Minister of Interior announced the creation of a national organi-
 zation charged with fighting racism. Coordinated by the Interior Ministry, the group
 is to include government Cabinet ministers and members of the National Assembly
 as well as representatives from churches and antiracist organizations. The effort is
 to include similar organizations at the department level. The Minister of Interior
 at the same time caled for a ban on neo-Nazi and other racist organizations. At
 year's end, no governmental action had been taken on this recommendation.
 Arbitrary identity checks by French police officers of members of minority groups
 sometimes have a tendency to transform blacks and people from the Maghreb coun-
 tries into "suspects." While any individual in France is subject to identity checks,
 
 
 875
 some human rights groups claim that members of minorities are stopped for ques-
 tioning more frequently than those of nonminorities.
 The Government seeks to encourage immigrants to adopt French traditions, laws,
 and language. Anything that emphasizes cultural and religious differences, e.g., the
 wearing of headscarves by Muslim schoolgirls (see Section 2.c.) is seen as working
 against integration and French cultural homogeneity. The French assert the pri-
 macy of the French language in the educational system.
 Religious Minorities.-A number of Muslim and Jewish graves were desecrated
 during 1993. Approximately 20 arrests were made.
 In Februa    President Mitterrand issued a decree establishing a National Re-
 membrance Day in memory of anti-Semitic persecution committed under the Vichy
 Government of 1940-44. President Mitterrand resisted calls to issue an apology to
 French Jews on the grounds that the Vichy regime was not the "true" French gov-
 ernment during the war, but he decided this year no longer to lay an Armistice Day
 wreath at the grave of World War I hero and Vichy leader Marshal Petain. Address-
 ing questions relating to France's Vichy past remains difficult for many government
 officials and much of French society. Former French police official Rene Bous(uet
 was assassinated on June 8 while awaiting trial for "crimes against humanity. In
 1942 Bousquet organized the roundup of more than 12,000 French Jews and their
 deportation to concentration camps. His assassin was an apparently unbalanced
 publicity-seeking Frenchman who was arrested shortly thereafter. No Vichy official
 has yet been tried and condemned in French courts for crimes against humanity,
 but the courts cleared the way in October for Paul Touvier, a pro-Nazi militia officer
 accused of ordering the murder of Jewish prisoners in 1944, to stand trial in 1994.
 There are approximately 3 million Muslims in France nearly one third of whom
 are French citizens. The Government created the Councif for the Reflection of Islam
 in France in 1990 to help integrate Muslims into French society.
 People with Disabilities.-A wide range of legislation provides protection for peo-
 ple with disabilities. An extensive program exists to provide special education to
 those with physical or mental disabilities and to assist those with emotional prob-
 lems. Financial aid is provided to families with students who need daily care.
 Handicapped persons over the age of 20 are eligible to receive support payments
 from the Government as well as reductions in their income tax.
 Since 1988 France has mandated that disabled persons make up at least 6 per-
 cent of all public and private enterprises with 20 or more employees. The Govern-
 ment will in some cases reimburse employers up to 20 percent of the costs of em-
 ploying someone who is handicapped. A recent government study found that many
 firms are not complying with this requirement and recommended strict enforcement
 mechanisms. In 1991 the Government legislated that new public buildings be made
 accessible to the physically handicapped. However, the great majority of existing
 buildings were constructed before that date, and it remains difficult or impossible
 for people using wheelchairs to enter them.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Freedom of association for all trade unions and
 workers is provided by the Constitution. Although less than 10 percent (12 to 15
 percent for the public sector; 5 to 6 percent for the private sector) of the total work
 force is unionized, trade unions exercise significant economic and political influence.
 They do so primarily through professional works councils and legally mandated
 roles (shared with employers) in administering social institutions. These include so-
 cial security (health care and most retirement systems), the unemplyment insurance
 system, labor courts, and the Economic and Social Council, a constitutionally
 manadated consultative body.
 Most unions pride themselves on not being aligned with any political party, and
 all are careful to avoid being stigmatized as government influenced. However, many
 of the leaders of the General Confederation of Labor (CGT) and its unions belong
 to the Communist Party.
 Tradition prevents union officials from holding office in political parties, but lead-
 ers of most non-CGT unions are supporters of the Socialist Party. Supporters of
 other parties are also active in the labor movement. The unions' international activi-
 ties are not restricted, and all three world trade union confederations have French
 affiliates. French workers, including civil servants, are free to strike, with a few ex-
 ceptions in cases where strikes are determined to be a threat to public safety. Given
 that one-fourth of the salaried population works for the Government, the numerous
 public sector strikes receive extensive coverage. Following a 2-week Air France
 strike in November, the airline was forced to cancel plans to implement a restruc-
 turing program that reportedly would have cost 4,000 jobs.
 
 
 Legal prohibitions exist against retribution toward strikers or strike leaders and
 are effectively enforced. In fact, the Government last year did not even censure pris-
 on guards who struck illegally.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Workers, including those in
 the three small export processing zones, have the right to organize and bargain col-
 lectively. French law strictly prohibits antiunion discrimination. Amendments added
 in 1982 require at least annual bargaining in the public and private sector on
 wages, hours, and working conditions at both plant and industry levels. The 1982
 law does not require that negotiations result in a signed contract. Outside medi-
 ators, drawn from the upper ranks of the civil service, may impose solutions that
 are binding unless formally rejected by either side within a week. If no new agree-
 ment can be reached, the contract from the previous year remains valid. Over 80
 percent of France's private sector work force is covered by collective bargaining
 agreements negotiated at national or local levels. Trilateral consultations also take
 place on such subjects as the minimum wage, temporary work, social security, and
 unemployment benefits. Labor tribunals of worker and employer representatives are
 available to resolve complaints. Employers found guilty of antiunion discrimination
 are required to reinstate workers fired for union activities. The law requires that
 businesses with more than 50 employees have a works council, in which workers
 are consulted on training, working conditions, profit-sharing, and similar issues.
 Works councils, which are open to both union and nonunion employees, are elected
 every 2 years.
 Trade union rights as provided for in the Constitution extend to France's over-
 seas departments and territories. Social benefits, such as the minimum wage or sup-
 plemental retirement payments may be reduced in the overseas departments and
 territories to take into account the local economies.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced or compulsory labor is pro-
 hibited by law, and this prohibition is effectively enforced. In its 1993 report, how-
 ever, the International Labor Organization's Committee of Experts questioned the
 French practice of obliging French prisoners to work for private enterprises at less
 than the national minimum wage.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-With a few exceptions for those
 enrolled in recognized apprenticeship programs, children under the age of 16 may
 not be employed. Generally, work considered arduous or work between the hours of
 10 p.m. and 5 a.m. may not be performed by minors under the age of 18. Laws pro-
 hibiting child employment are effectively enforced through periodic checks by labor
 inspectors.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-France has an administratively determined
 minimum wage, revised whenever the cost-of-living index rises 2 percentage points,
 and it is sufficient to provide a decent standard of living to a worker and family.
 The wage was administratively adjusted to 34.83 francs in July, approximately
 $5.90 at the end of the year. The legal workweek is 39 hours. In an effort to in-
 crease employment, overtime is restricted to 9 hours per week. The previously dis-
 criminatory law prohibiting women from performing arduous or night work, except
 in certain exempted categories such as hospitals and a few service industries, was
 revoked in 1992. In this regard, France joined other European Community signato-
 ries in denouncing the ILO Convention 89 banning night work for women, and in
 adhering to the new nondiscriminatory ILO Convention 171 on night work.
 The Ministry of Labor has overall responsibility for policing occupational safety
 and health laws. Standards are generally high and well enforced. Workers have the
 right to remove themselves from dangerous work situations. To assist the Ministry,
 the law requires that any enterprise with 50 or more employees have an occupa-
 tional health and safety committee; 78 percent of all enterprises, covering 80 per-
 cent of employees, had such committees as of 1991.
