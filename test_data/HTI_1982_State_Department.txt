 HAITI
 Haiti has had a long and troubled history of authoritarian
 rule characterized by periods of political instability and
 human rights abuses. It has been ruled for the past
 twenty-five years by the Duvalier family in the name of a
 black populist and national revolution. Following the death
 of President for Life (1957-1971) Francois Duvalier, his son
 Jean Claude Duvalier became President for Life
 (1971-present).
 The country is constitutionally a republic and executive
 authority is vested in the President. The legislature is a
 unicameral chamber with members elected for six-year terms.
 The judicial system is not completely independent of the
 executive branch. In practice, virtually all effective
 government powers are concentrated in the presidency. During
 the eight months of each year when the Legislative Assembly
 is in recess, major sections of the Constitution concerning
 protection of individual liberties are suspended, and the
 President is granted full powers to rule by decree.
 In 1982 Haiti experienced renewed efforts by Haitian exile
 groups to overthrow the Government. In January 1982, Haitian
 exile leader Bernard Sansaricq, a US resident alien, launched
 an unsuccessful invasion by a small force on Haiti's La
 Tortue Island which resulted in the death of eight invaders
 and four members of the Haitian security forces. In March
 1982, another group's invasion attempt was stopped within US
 waters by US law enforcement authorities shortly after the
 Haitians set out to sea.  Both groups were later indicted
 for violation of the United States neutrality laws, and the
 first group has been found guilty.
 In July 1982, a third exile group of US resident Haitians
 participated in a shooting incident near the capital city of
 Port au Prince, in which an American citizen was wounded by
 gunfire. In August, the Haitian Government arrested about 16
 business people for questioning about this latter incident,
 holding some without charges for up to three weeks before
 releasing them. This was in violation of Haitian law which
 provides that arrestees be charged or released within 48
 workday hours of their arrest. An additional four
 individuals were arrested and held without charge for several
 days to two weeks for questioning about the authorship and
 circulation of an anti-government tract and threatening phone
 calls to Haitian government officials.
 Civil and political rights are severely restricted in Haiti.
 Public criticism of the Government is not generally
 permitted. The two political parties established in 1979,
 the Haitian Christian Democratic party and the Haitian Social
 Christian party, have not functioned since 1980. In 1980,
 the Haitian Government arrested approximately 50 individuals
 and expelled 16 others of its critics for various charges of
 conspiracy and subversion. All oppositionists arrested in
 1980 have subsequently been released. There are now 10
 individuals still in detention for political or security
 related reasons.

 In 1982, Haiti took several potentially significant steps
 toward improved observance of human rights and political
 liberalization: a National Human Rights Commission was
 established; a law was promulgated providing for municipal
 elections, the first of which is anticipated for 1983; an
 invitation was extended to members of the Haitian exile
 community to return to Haitil and two retrials of political
 prisoners were held in August 1982. The fairness of these
 trials was criticized by international observers. The
 defendants were found guilty and were given the maximum
 sentences possible under the law.  However, the defendants,
 consisting of the 22 members of Sylvio Claude's Haitian
 Christian Democratic Party and three other oppositionists,
 were accorded presidential clemency and released from
 detention in September 1982.
 Haiti has permitted visitors from the International Red
 Cross, the UN Human .Rights Commission, and members of the
 United States Congress to visit its political prisoners and
 has responded positively to suggestions for improvement of
 their conditions.
 Since the 1971 assumption of office by President Jean Claude
 Duvalier, Haiti's human rights situation has gradually
 improved, despite setbacks such as those that occurred in
 1980. The long term trend is toward slow improvement,
 particularly in those areas governing protection of
 individual liberties.
 Over the short term, Haiti's commitment to human rights and
 political change will be demonstrated by the implementation
 of the reforms announced in 1982, as well as the reaction to
 potential security threats against the state.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Killings
 In the wake of the January 1982 invasion attempt, the
 Government announced that all eight invaders were killed in
 action or died of their wounds. There were, however, reports
 that at least some of the eight invaders died after being
 captured by government forces. In September 1982, several
 armed Haitian soldiers engaged in a confrontation with a few
 members of the civilian militia in Port au Prince. During
 the ensuing gunfire, three civilian spectators were reported
 killed and others wounded. The soldiers were arrested and
 the Government has opened an inquiry into the case. Aside
 from these incidents, there were no reported killings for
 political reasons in 1982.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no disappearances during 1982, although, in some
 instances, the police failed initially to inform family
 members of an individual's arrest. The police ordinarily,
 however, do not refuse to confirm an arrest if inquiries are
 made. There have been no long term or permanent
 disappearances in recent years.
 
 
 546
 c. Torture
 A few cases of beatings by police authorities were reported
 by prisoners or those interrogated for suspected crimes in
 1982. There were no substantiated allegations of more
 sophisticated forms of torture during 1982.
 d. Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 Beatings, a traditional practice in Haitian jails, continued
 to be administered in 1982 in connection with the
 interrogation of some suspects or the punishment of prisoners
 violating prison discipline. The Government has not taken
 effective measures to eradicate the practice of beatings.
 Two of the 20 individuals arrested for questioning on August
 1982 were reportedly beaten during their interrogation;
 another had his head shaven. Physical facilities, medical
 care, and diet in prison facilities are generally
 satisfactory. Lesser offenders may be visited by family
 members, who may also bring them food, but persons considered
 dangerous by the Government may receive no mail and few if
 any visits. In May 1982, the Government enacted a decree
 mandating improved physical conditions for political
 prisoners and prohibiting hard labor.
 e. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 Of 52 individuals identified as political prisoners by an
 international agency in 1981, there are currently 10
 remaining in detention. Four of these prisoners were
 admitted members of a 1981 guerrilla incursion into Haiti,
 they have not yet been brought to trial. The other six, some
 of whom are members of the civilian militia ("volunteers for
 national security"), are being held on a variety of charges
 but have not been brought to trial.
 Habeas corpus exists mainly in principle. According to the
 Haitian Constitution, arrests must be based on a formal
 charge of a violation of law and must be followed by an
 appearance before a judge to rule on the validity of the
 charge within 48 hours. This provision is often not
 followed. Although not specifically defined by law,
 open-ended preventive detention exists.
 f. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Haitian courts held trials and retrials for political and
 criminal offenders during 1982, although some defendants
 often remain in prison for months without being charged or
 brought to trial as provided by law. Defendants have the
 right to counsel, although in some instances counsel may not
 meet with the defendants until several days prior to the
 trial, as was the case during the August 1981 trial of
 oppositionist Sylvio Claude and 25 of his associates.
 Similarly, according to Haitian practice, formal charges may
 often not be made until several days prior to the trial.
 In March 1982, the Haitian Supreme Court overturned the
 convictions of Sylvio Claude, 21 of his associates (four
 others were earlier released from prison), and three other
 prisoners, known as the St. Marc group, on the ground that
 their original trials, in 1981 and 1980 respectively,
 
 
 contained technical and procedural irregularities including
 inappropriate sentencing. Both groups were later retried on
 charges of conspiracy in August 1982 and were represented by
 counsel appointed by the private Haitian Human Rights
 League. The trials were open and in accordance with Haitian
 legal procedures. Defendants were found guilty and sentenced
 to prison terms which, although less than the original
 sentences, were the maximum permissible under the law.
 International observers contended that the state failed to
 prove its charges and that the marathon nature of the trials
 (extending 21 hours for the Sylvio Claude trial) brought into
 question their fairness. Questions also were raised about
 the independence of the judiciary. In September 1982, the
 Sylvio Claude group and St. Marc group prisoners were granted
 presidential clemency and released from prison.
 There are no separate political courts. Political offenders
 have been tried in the civil criminal courts. Military
 courts are reserved for members of the military. All
 defendants have the right to appeal court verdicts to the
 Haitian Supreme Court, as successfully demonstrated by the
 Claude and St. Marc retrials. The judicial system is not
 completely independent of the executive branch.
 g. Invasion of the Home
 Contrary to legal safeguards, there was one reported invasion
 of the home in 1982 in connection with the investigation of
 the Tortue invasion.
 2. Respect for Civil and Political Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Haitian Constitution provides for freedom of speech and
 press but in practice these freedoms are greatly
 circumscribed. The 1980 press code remains unchanged and
 retains serious restrictions. A formal requirement (which
 cannot be met by daily newspapers) states that all
 publications be submitted to the censors 72 hours in advance;
 the licensing of press credentials, including foreign
 journalists, is required by the Ministry of the Interior; and
 material critical of the president or his family is
 prohibited. Opposition viewpoints have not been freely
 ventilated since the 1980 Haitian Government crackdown on its
 critics, many of whom were well known journalists and
 broadcasters who went into exile or were jailed. Haitian
 media more commonly employ a form of "self-censorship", and
 from fear of reprisals voluntarily omit political opposition
 viewpoints, and refrain from direct criticism of the
 Government and senior officials.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 This freedom is severely curtailed in Haiti. Communists and
 other left-wing groups are prohibited from organizing and
 groups not registered with the Government are limited to
 public assemblies of fewer than 20 people.
 Haiti's urban unemployment is estimated at 40 to 50 percent
 of the job-seeking population in Port au Prince. Less than
 one percent of this work force is unionized. Little in the
 way of trade organization or collective bargaining exists,
 
 
 548
 and strikes are extremely rare. There are approximately 20
 small unions. Unions must obtain recognition from the
 Ministry of Social Affairs and conform to the labor code
 which provides for a direct government role in labor
 disputes. Labor union activity decreased with the 1980
 expulsion of leaders of the Centre Autonome des Travailleurs
 Haitiens which was Haiti's only independent labor forum. No
 other groups have encountered any government harassment, and
 professional bodies are permitted to maintain relations with
 recognized international bodies in their fields.
 Recently, the International Labor Organization conducted an
 investigation into the treatment of Haitian sugar cane
 cutters recruited to work in the Dominican Republic. Its
 initial findings were that Haitian laborers in the Dominican
 Republic were treated harshly and sometimes not in accordance
 with Dominican law or the relevant bilateral agreement
 between the Governments of Haiti and the Dominican Republic.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Roman Catholicism is the official religion. Voodoo, the
 local religion, is widely practiced. All other religions are
 freely practiced and there is no religious discrimination.
 d. Freedom of Movement within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 The Government does not impede domestic movement. A number
 of individuals, for political reasons, including some persons
 questioned in August 1982, are forbidden to leave the
 country. A law has recently been enacted which will allow
 married women to leave the country without the written
 authorization of their husbands, which was the previous legal
 requirement. Foreign travel requires a passport and exit
 visa which together can cost up to $97. Those who leave
 illegally may be subject to fine or imprisonment. However,
 as noted below , persons repatriated from the United States
 and other countries are not prosecuted for their illegal
 departure. The Government recently extended an invitation to
 Haitian exiles to return to the country and announced that
 its overseas consulates will issue re-entry visas to any
 Haitian who wishes to return to Haiti.
 In September 1981, the Governments of the US and the Republic
 of Haiti signed an accord to establish a program of bilateral
 cooperation to stop the illegal migration of Haitians to the
 United States. An estimated 800,000 Haitians left Haiti over
 the past 20 years, primarily in search of better economic
 opportunities. During 1982, the deterrent effect of the
 bilateral agreement, the detention policy in the United
 States for illegal migrants, and the efforts of the Haitian
 Government to control illegal trafficking in emigrants
 resulted in a drastic reduction in undocumented migration via
 boats from Haiti to the United States.
 The Haitian Government pledged that returning illegal
 migrants would not be subject to prosecution or harassment
 for their illegal departure. Regular follow-up interviews
 with returnees have confirmed they have suffered no
 harassment or prosecution by the Haitian government. The
 Government is currently exploring with the International
 Committee on Migration a feasibility study on the potential
 
 
 549
 legal migration of some Haitians to Belize.
 a. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Political participation in ruling Haiti is limited to a small
 group of people associated with President Duvalier. In
 accordance with the Constitution, President Jean Claude
 Duvalier was designated as President by his father and
 predecessor, Francois Duvalier. He was subsequently
 confirmed as Life President in a national referendum. The
 last elections for the unicameral legislature were held in
 February 1979. Some observers claimed those elections were
 manipulated by the Government. The two newly formed
 political parties, Haitian Christian Democratic and Haitian
 Social Christian, played minor roles in 1979, but were
 effectively put out of business after November 1980. One
 independent deputy was elected, although he and the remaining
 members of the legislature are all supporters of the
 Government. A new Haitian election law which was passed by
 the National Assembly in August 1982 and signed by President
 Duvalier in November 1982, establishes procedures for
 elections to the National Assembly, Municipal Councils and
 rural Administrative Councils. Under the new law, voting and
 electoral procedures are solely conducted by civilians, in
 contrast to the previous Haitian practice of having the
 military conduct all elections. The law provides for a voter
 registration mechanism, secret ballot and the establishment
 of voting administration boards. Voter registration bureaus
 are charged with registration of voters, maintenance of
 permanent electoral lists and registration of candidates for
 each election. The new law paves the way for the holding of
 municipal elections in 1983, the first such elections since
 1957.
 3. Government Attitude Regarding International and Non-
 governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The United Nations Human Rights Commission (UNHRC) appointed
 a special rapporteur on Haiti in 1981 who subsequently
 visited Haiti in 1981 and 1982 to observe the country's human
 rights situation. The special rapporteur reported that
 Haitian officials had provided full and forthcoming
 cooperation with his mission. A 1982 visit by
 representatives of the United States Congress confirmed that
 conditions in Haiti's jails and prisons have improved, and
 that political prisoners have been treated reasonably well.
 Recommendations regarding prison conditions made to the
 Government by the UNHRC have been studied by Haitian
 officials and improvements continue to be made. The
 Inter-American Human Rights Commission critized the
 Government of Haiti in its 1981-82 report for inadequate
 cooperation. The Government of Haiti has permitted embassy
 officers freedom of travel during 1981-82 throughout the
 country to investigate the treatment of returning migrants.
 The Government participates in international and regional
 human rights bodies, though it has not taken an active role
 in these meetings. It permitted international human rights
 bodies, including Amnesty International and the Lawyers
 Commmittee for International Human Rights, among others, to
 observe two trials of political prisoners in August 1982. It
 has also allowed international journalists freedom of travel
 and the same rights to observe trials of the political
 
 
 550
 prisoners.
 The Haitian Government established a National Human Rights
 Commission in 1982 to act as a consultative and advisory body
 to the Government on human rights affairs. The nine members
 of the autonomous Commission were installed in a public
 ceremony on November 11. The private League of Human Rights
 continues to monitor individual human rights. It appointed
 lawyers to represent political oppositionists at their 1982
 trials, and sent a delegation to visit the former prisoners
 after their release.
 Following a two-year absence from active participation after
 the Government's crackdown on its critics in 1980, the
 private Human Rights League has taken a more public role,
 through increased dialogue with the Government, publication
 of its views in the media, and an active recruiting
 campaign. Its role does not appear to conflict with that of
 the National Human Rights Commission. The Government has not
 entered into dialogue with external non-governmental human
 rights groups.
 Several international, non-governmental organizations have
 commented on the Haitian human rights situation. Amnesty
 International's 1982 report, covering 1981, stated that the
 organization's concerns "focused on the continuing detention
 of prisoners of conscience, detention without trial,
 irregular trial procedures in political cases, and
 allegations of ill-treatment of political detainees."
 Freedom House's 1982 report classified Haiti as "Not Free."
 4. Economic, Social, and Cultural Situation
 Haiti is the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere and
 one of the least developed countries in the world. It has
 limited natural resources and severe deficiencies in
 infrastructure. Agriculture employs at least 70 percent of
 the population. Intense pressure on land resources has
 resulted in destruction of the forest cover on hillsides
 unsuitable for cultivation--while only 30 percent of the land
 is considered arable, about 50 percent is actually
 cultivated. Average plot size is about three acres which is
 too small for most modern farming methods. Many peasants do
 not enjoy clear title to their land, which impedes
 significant capital improvements. The World Bank and AID
 estimate that 78 percent of the rural and 55 percent of the
 urban population exist below the absolute poverty level.
 Coffee, essential oils from vetiver, and mangoes are the
 primary agricultural exports.
 The industrial and commercial sector is relatively small and
 heavily concentrated in the Port au Prince area. The
 availability of investment capital is limited by banking
 practices; overseas hedging results in capital flight. There
 are a few medium-sized basic industrial plants, and over 200
 firms engaged in assembly or light industrial transformation
 have initiated operations, providing approximately 60,000
 jobs. There are about 3,000 kilometers of roads, of which
 about 600 would be considered as first class. Many regions
 of the country are accessible only by four-wheel drive
 vehicle.
 Infant mortality is estimated at 130 per 1,000 live births
 
 
 551
 and is increasing in urban centers. Hospitals are
 rudimentary, and life expectancy is 53.2 years. Many Haitian
 children have no access to schooling. During the past six
 years, the Government, with international donor assistance,
 has been engaged in extensive school construction. The World
 Bank and AID estimate that 62 percent of Haitian children had
 access to primary schooling in 1978, but less than four
 percent of those who started primary school finished.
 In 1978 the adult literacy rate was estimated at 23.3
 percent. Social services are severely limited outside the
 capital city. Sanitation facilities are virtually
 non-existent and illnesses are easily spread by the lack of
 access to safe water of 93 percent of rural inhabitants.
 Family planning programs are gaining greater acceptability
 and the population growth rate was estimated at 2.6 percent
 in 1980.
 Agricultural productivity has been declining, as plots are
 subdivided into even smaller pieces and increasingly
 unsuitable slopes are brought under cultivation. Port au
 Prince and other urban areas are experiencing abnormally
 rapid growth (7-10 percent) because of rural flight to the
 cities. Urban living conditions are worsening as a result.
 There is a housing density of approximately two persons per
 room and sanitation facilities are poor with only 12 percent
 of the urban population having access to safe water. There
 is an increasing problem of urban unemployment. No precise
 figures on this can be obtained, but the Haitian Department
 of Information estimates that 41 percent of those seeking
 work cannot get it.
 The economy is also facing serious problems common to other
 Caribbean countries. These include approximately 10 percent
 domestic inflation, capital outflow, shortfalls in government
 revenue, and increased costs for petroleum and other critical
 imports. During 1982, the gross national product was about
 $1.5 billion, with very little growth. The average per
 capita income is about $330 per year, although in some rural
 areas it is below $150.
 Although the Government has been the beneficiary of
 substantial amounts of outside assistance since 1973, the per
 capita value has been well below that of most aid recipient
 nations in the hemisphere. Only token amounts of foreign
 assistance and disaster relief were provided between
 1963-73. Foreign assistance to Haiti in 1982, from all
 official sources, amounted to about $120 million, (including
 about $44 million from the United States), most of which was
 directed toward improvements in agriculture, education,
 health, and transportation.
 A substantial portion of total US assistance to Haiti is
 channelled through private and voluntary organizations.
 Efforts of the United States and other donors to bring about
 administrative reform, budgetary control, and tighter reins
 on diversion of government funds have begun to meet with
 limited success. The Haitian Government has continued to
 execute a program of greater fiscal and economic reform
 measures recommended by international financial
 institutions. Under the International Monetary Fund program
 the Government has begun to curb previous fiscal practices
 which had undercut Haiti's development efforts in 1981 and
 
 
 552
 had eroded its solvency and foreign exchange position.
 Centralization of budgetary accounts and revenues has taken
 place. The Government has, with outside help, completed the
 northern and southern highway, many secondary roads, clinics,
 schools, the electrification of a number of provincial
 cities, and the extension of the telephone system. With AID
 assistance, it is expanding secondary roads through a large
 labor intensive construction program.
 The minimum wage is $2.64 per day. Employers outside of Port
 au Prince are supposed to pay transportation expenses up to
 28 cents per day for commuting workers. There are, however,
 many workers for whom the minimum wage does not apply and who
 have difficulty in earning enough to provide for their basic
 needs. In rural areas, the day wage for farm labor ranges
 from 60 US cents to $2. While there is a government social
 security plan, few Haitian urban workers are covered and no
 rural workers are covered.
 For many Haitians, economic opportunities lie only outside
 the country. Until the United States and Haiti concluded the
 agreement on interdiction of illegal Haitian migrants in
 1981, thousands migrated illegally to the Bahamas and the
 United States; it is estimated that 20,000 illegal migrants
 arrived in the US in 1980. As many as 80,000 migrate
 seasonally each year to the Dominican Republic to work as
 sugar cane cutters.
 The Haitian Constitution gives equal rights to men and
 women.   Under a recently enacted law, a married woman no
 longer forfeits the right to manage her own property, is no
 longer required to live in her spouse's residence, and is no
 longer required to have her husband's permission to obtain an
 exit visa. Qualified Haitian women have access to most jobs,
 including government appointments. They receive wages in
 general equal to those received by their male counterparts.
 Although 54 percent of the economically active population is
 female, they are concentrated in nonskilled occupations.
 Lack of education bars women from access to the better job
 opportunities.
