 VENEZUELA
 
 Venezuelan democracy has established firm roots during
 the twenty-one years since the end of the Perez Jimenez
 dictatorship. The country's good human rights record
 has kept pace with the institutionalization of democracy.
 Venezuela's ability to effect transition of power between
 opposing political parties without adverse political
 or human rights consequences was demonstrated again
 with the accession of President Luis Herrera Campins
 in March 1979, following democratic elections in which
 87 percent of eligible voters participated.
 Venezuela has been a strong public supporter of international
 efforts to improve the observance of human rights.
 Its leaders have spoken out frequently on human rights
 in the OAS and other international fora. President
 Herrera opened a human rights colloquium, co-sponsored
 by the U.S. Embassy and a private Venezuelan foundation,
 on June 28, 1979.
 Individual liberties are protected in Venezuela by
 a judiciary which enforces the right of habeas corpus,
 a free and critical press which will focus without
 hesitation on alleged human rights abuses, and an open
 multi-party political system (including an independent
 legislature) which allows free competition for public
 attention and votes. Successive democratic governments
 have pursued effective policies to coopt politically
 motivated advocates of violence into the legitimate
 political process.
 1.   Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a.   Torture
 Torture is neither permitted nor practiced. Constitu-
 tional guarantees of the integrity of the person are
 enforced.
 b.   Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Laws prohibiting cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment
 or punishment are generally respected. Infrequent
 claims of prisoner mistreatment usually involve denial
 of privileges rather than physical abuse. Mistreatment
 of peasants held on suspicion of involvement in terrorist
 activities in Eastern Venezuela has been known to occur,
 but is not condoned by the government. The number
 of common criminals killed during confrontations with
 police is sizeable. Heavy-handedness directed against
 criminals caught in the act meets with public acceptance,
 largely because of a growing crime rate. However,
 clearly illegal police activity is not tolerated either
 by the authorities or the public. Prison conditions,
 including food, exercise and medical care, are adequate
 and not a subject of public complaint.

 c.   Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 Generally, individuals are arrested and imprisoned
 for legitimate  reasons. Arrested persons cannot legally
 be held more than eight days without the filing of
 formal charges. Charges usually are filed within that
 time period, and delays normally reflect the bureaucratic
 process rather than arbitrary detention. The number
 of persons held for politically motivated crimes is
 estimated at 20-50, depending on definitions and varying
 assessments of the political motivation of the crimes.
 These prisoners are all charged with specific common
 criminal offenses, not with non-violent political activity.
 The government acknowledges holding a few politically
 motivated criminals, justifying their detention or
 imprisonment on the grounds that they have been formally
 charged or convicted of common crimes.
 Shortly after his inauguration, President Herrera embarked
 on a low-key amnesty program which has resulted in
 the release of or dropping of charges against about
 145 persons convicted of or charged with common crimes,
 including politically motivated crimes. The-amnesty
 has included Venezuela's best known guerrilla leaders
 and substantially reduced the number of persons held
 for politically motivated crimes (although the number
 amnestied also includes persons not in custody against
 whom charges were dropped and persons whose crimes
 were not politically motivated).  Periodic releases
 took place throughout the year, indicating a continuing
 case-by-case amnesty review.
 d.   Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Venezuelan law and practice provide for fair trials.
 Rules of evidence are extremely strict and it is not
 easy to obtain convictions. Civilians accused of paramilitary
 activity involving weapons or explosives and kidnapping
 for ransom are tried in the military court system.
 This practice originated in the 1960's when Venezuela
 faced a serious guerrilla threat. The initial decision
 as to whether prosecution in an individual case should
 be under the military code is made by the military
 prosecutor. This can be appealed through the Fiscal
 General (equivalent to Attorney General), with jurisdiction
 ultimately decided by the Supreme Court. The military
 follows the civilian code in lodging charges, and the
 accused has access to legal representation. While
 military justice provides for full access to the court
 by the accused and his lawyers, third party access
 to the proceedings is left to the judge's discretion.
 There is no enforceable limit on the amount of time
 the state can take in preparing a case for trial in
 the military courts, and some prisoners accused of
 crimes falling within military jurisdiction have been
 held for long periods without trial (as long as seven
 years, according to Amnesty International). We have
 no indication that the Herrera Government has prosecuted
 civilians under the military justice system. Rather,
 the'amnesty program has resulted in the release of
 civilians previously prosecuted under military justice
 and the dropping of charges against persons whose prosecution
 under military justice was pending.

 e.   Invasion of the Home
 Effective legal safeguards against arbitrary invasion
 of the home are respected in practice.
 2.   Governmental Policies Relating to the Fulfillment
 of Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care
 and Education:
 After several years of very rapid growth leading to
 inflationary pressures and balance of payments deficits,
 the Venezuelan economy is going through a relatively
 slack period, which local observers consider an essentially
 healthy development. However, the cost of living rose
 by about 12 percent in 1979, high by Venezuelan standards.
 The government is moderating the growth of public spending,
 borrowing, and monetary liquidity to help reduce inflation
 and has expressed determination to use trade liberalization
 to fight excessive price increases that could harm
 consumers. It is exercising caution, however, about
 general wage increases to avoid fueling inflation from
 the supply side and harming the competitive position
 of local industry.
 Venezuela is a major oil producer, and the proceeds
 from this industry dominate the country's public finances
 *and balance of payments. GDP per capita was about
 $3,000 in 1978, but income and wealth distribution
 are uneven and the need for improvement in this area
 is widely recognized. The government of President
 Herrera is committed to strong emphasis on social services
 and programs to help the less fortunate segments of
 society. Over half the current expenditures in the
 1980 budget are allocated to health, education, housing,
 culture, marginal areas development, and social security.
 Priority programs include low-cost housing, expansion
 of health care facilities, new schools and nutrition
 programs.
 Venezuela's economy is mixed, with government participation
 and control of a wide range of capital-intensive industry.
 The under-productive agricultural sector is subsidized,
 and many basic foodstuffs are price-controlled. Price
 controls on some items were removed this year because
 of the need to stimulate domestic production; the removal
 of these controls has affected the poor adversely,
 at least in the short-run.
 Success in providing educational facilities throughout
 the country accounts in large part for the rise in
 the literacy rate to an estimated 83 percent. Schooling
 through 8th grade is the government's goal, but it
 is not being fully met. Free public education is available
 through high school in many areas, but space shortages
 exist. Technical training to meet the rapidly rising
 demand for skilled labor is a major priority of the
 government.
 Unemployment was about 5 percent of the labor force
 in 1978, according to official statistics, but has
 probably increased somewhat during 1979. Although
 skilled labor has moved far towards attaining middle
 class status, poverty remains widespread in rural areas
 and urban slums. Approximately three quarters of regular
 wage and salary earners are protected by social security.
 Most Venezuelans are not affected by taxes (except
 
 
 425
 import taxes), as sales taxes are moderate and income
 taxes apply only to those earning more than $17,000
 annually. Income taxes are steeply progressive, but
 administered rather loosely. Most of the government's
 revenue derives from petroleum, which is the principal
 source of funding for social welfare as well as infrastructure
 projects. Corruption, although a problem, does not
 appear to be a substantial obstacle to expansion of
 social services.
 3.   Respect for Civil and Political Liberties,
 Including:
 a.   Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and
 Assembly
 These four freedoms are guaranteed in the Constitution
 and respected in practice. Freedom to organize for
 any legal purpose is respected. The press is free
 and critical. Harassment of the press (such as temporary
 cancellation of media programs, withdrawal of official
 advertising, and brief detention of journalists) has
 been rare, dnd has not occurred since the inauguration
 of the Herrera Government in March. Past instances
 of harassment involved government reaction to criticism
 perceived either as support for subversion or as intended
 to offend the President personally. In all such instances,
 the media and its professional associations made their
 complaints freely and without harrassment. The press
 demands and gets respect in its relationship with the
 government.
 b.   Freedom of Movement Within the Country,
 Foreign Travel and Emigration
 There are no restrictions on freedom of movement, domes-
 tically or overseas. Venezuelans may emigrate freely,
 but very few choose to do so.
 c.   Freedom to Participate in the Political
 Process
 Venezuela has been a multi-party democracy since 1958.
 Two of those parties have elected presidents and held
 a majority or plurality of the seats in the legislature
 during the entire'period. The opposition operates
 freely. Participation in the political system is open
 to all, and national elections usually record a voter
 turnout of approximately 90 percent. There has been
 no significant election fraud in recent years. Trade
 and peasant unions play an important political role
 in Venezuela, effectively ensuring representation of
 labor and peasant interests in the political process.
 Extensive labor rights are protected by law and respected
 in practice.
 Venezuela has just started to reexamine its traditional
 perception of the role and rights of women. The Herrera
 Government includes a Minister of State for Women's
 Affairs. A National Movement of Women, which aspires
 to be a multiparty representative of women's interests,
 was launched in July 1979. Women are still under-represented
 in political and economic life. While educated women
 are fairly well represented in some professions and
 middle management, and manufacturing industries are
 starting to hire women blue-collar workers, traditional
 cultural bias and discrimination in employment are
 commonly encountered. Women's wages are normally lower
 than those of men for the same work. Women are also
 in a legally weak position in conflicts involving family
 property, children, and fatherless homes.
 4.   Government Attitude and Record Regarding International
 and Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged
 Violations of Human Rights:
 The Venezuelan Government is An international leader
 in the human rights field. The Venezuelan Government
 has supported United Nations mechanisms for the monitoring
 of human rights violations. An Amnesty International
 office operates freely in Caracas. Venezuela has ratified
 the American Convention on Human Rights and strongly
 supports the Inter-American Human Rights Commission
 (IAHRC), which is presently headed by a Venezuelan.
