 BULGARIA-
 Bulgaria is a parliamentary republic ruled by a democratically elected govern-
 ment. President Petar Stoyanov of the Union of Democratic Forces (UDF) began a
 5-year term of office in January 1997 following his election in late 1996. UDF leader
 Ivan Kostov currently serves as Prime Minister. The judiciary is independent but
 suffers from corruption and continues to struggle with structural and staffing prob-
 lems.
 Most internal security services are the responsibility of the Ministry of the Inte-
 rior (MOI), which exercises improving but incomplete control of the police, the Cen-
 tral Service for Combating Organized Crime, the National Security Service (civilian
 intelligence), internal security troops, border guards, and special forces. The Special
 Investigative Service (SIS) is responsible to the Chief Prosecutor. Some members of
 the police committed serious human rights abuses.
 The post-Communist economy continued to be heavily dependent on unprofitable
 state enterprises, although the growing private sector now accounts for about 50
 percent of economic activity. Most persons are employed in the industrial and serv-
 ice sectors; key industries include food processing, chemical and oil processing, met-
 allurgy, and energy. Principal exports are agricultural products, cigarettes and to-
 bacco, chemicals, and metal products. Following a severe financial and economic cri-
 sis in 1996 and early 1997, the new reformist government introduced a successful
 macroeconomic stabilization program. The Government places a great deal of em-
 phasis on attracting foreign investment and promised far-reaching structural re-
 forms to make the country a viable candidate for European Union membership, al-
 though privatization has not moved forward as quickly as hoped. The annuai per
 capita gross domestic product of $1,115 provides a relatively low standard of living.
 The Government generally respected the human rights of its citizens; however,
 problems remained in some areas. Police used questionable lethal force against
 three suspects. Security forces beat suspects and inmates and at times arbitrarily
 arrested and detained persons. Reforms designed to increase accountability have im-
 proved the Government's control over the security forces, although control remains
 incomplete. A climate of impunity persists and inhibits government attempts to end
 police abuses. Conditions in some prisons were harsh, pretrial detention was often
 prolonged, and inspection visits were not allowed in some prisons. The judiciary is
 underpaid, understaffed, and has a heavy case backlog; corruption is a serious prob-
 lem. A journalist investigating crime and corruption was physically attacked. Con-
 stitutional restrictions on political parties formed on ethnic, racial, or religious lines
 effectively limit participation for some groups. Police, local government authorities,
 and private citizens continued to obstruct the activities of nontraditional religious
 
 
 1182
 
 groups, although there was some improvement in their treatment by central govern-
 ment authorities. Violence 'and discrimination against women remained serious
 problems, and some women were also victims of trafficking and forced prostitution.
 iscrimination and societal violence against Roma were serious problems. Because
 of a lack of funds, social services did not adequately assist homeless and other vul-
 nerable children, notably Romani children. Security forces harassed, physically
 abused, and arbitrarily arrested and detained Romani street children. Chid labor
 was a problem.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political
 killings.
 In three cases, police officers used questionable lethal force against citizens, two
 of whom were members of the Roma minority. However, there were no reports of
 deaths in custody.
 On January 30, Tzvetan Kovachev was shot and killed by police officers while
 fleeing from them in Kostinbrod. Human rights groups expressed concern that
 Kovachev did not threaten police with a lethal weapon gut was simply seen in the
 company of a fleeing murder suspect. He was killed by a bullet wound behind the
 right temple. No investigation of police conduct took place.
 On June 20, police fatally shot Yordan Yankov in the Ovcha Kupel district of
 Sofia. Police claimed that Yankov's shooting was a case of mistaken identity, as they
 were at that otime chasing fleeing criminal suspects in the vicinity. When told to
 halt, Yankov, also a member of the Roma minority and also unarmed, fled in fear
 and was shot. Yankov also died of a gunshot wound to the head. Witnesses claimed
 that he was hit first by a bullet in the foot, which immobilized him, before receiving
 the fatal wound to the head. The policeman who fired the fatal shot was indicted
 for murder. However, the court found that there was a conflict of interest on the
 part of the investigator and returned the case to the prosecutor's office. The inves-
 tigation again was pending at year's end.
 In October 16-year-old Staniela Bugova was killed by police when her brother's
 car was stopped in a routine check near the town of Sliven. Bugova, who was seated
 in the back of the car while one policeman checked her brother's documents, was
 shot in the head' when another policeman present discharged his assault rifle, ap-
 parently by accident. An investigation is underway, and the officer who fired the
 fatal shot was charged with manslaughter. A public scandal~ensued, and the Min-
 ister of Interior demanded and received the resignation of the national police direc-
 tor of the region.
 An incident of racial violence resulted the death of a Rom in May at the hands
 of skinheads (see Section 5).
 Several cases of deaths in custody in 1997 remain unsolved. Investigations still
 were pending in the cases of Stefan Stanev and Georgi Biandov. The investigation
 into the 1997 death of Elin Karamanov was suspended for lack of evidence. In the
 1997 case regarding the fatal shooting of Vasil Kalinov, charges against the civilian
 who fired the fatal shot were dropped on the grounds of insufficient evidence. The
 policeman accused of beating Mincho Simeonov to death in 1997 was convicted, but
 his appeal was pending at year's end. The investigation into the case of Kolo
 Todorov, a Rom arrested in 1997 for theft who was shot and killed while trying to
 escape detention, was suspended for lack of evidence.
 The murder of former Prime Minister Andrei Lukanov in 1996 remains unsolved.
 In July the investigation once again was extended. The European Court of Human
 Rights agreed to hear the case' of Anguel Zabchikov, a 17-year-old Rom who died
 in police custody in Razgrad in-1996. The police officer accused of murdering Ortho-
 dox priest Yordan Tsolov in 1994 was convicted; his appeal was pending atyear's
 end. In February four policemen were convicted of murdering an ethnic Turk during
 a protest against the. forced assimilation campaign in 1989; the highest sentence
 meted out was 2/2 years (see Section i.e.).
 In October the Government closed the case of the unresolved "umbrella" murder
 of dissident Georgi Markov in 1978 in London, when he was injected with a poison
 pellet from the tip on an umbrella. Markov's family believed that former Communist
 dictator Todor Zhivkov had ordered the killing.  -
 There was no progress in the trial concerning the notorious death camps set up
 by the Communists after they took power in 1944.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution expressly prohibits torture and cruel, inhuman, or degrading treat-
 
 
 1183
 ment. Despite this prohibition, police beat criminal suspects and members of minori-
 ties. In particular, security forces physically abuse Romani street children. There
 were also allegations that police beat nonviolent protesters (see Section 6.a.).
 The Human Rights Project (HRP) reported that on March 10, police beat Rossen
 Alekov, a 15-year-old Rom from Shumen, after he was taken into custody on sus-
 picion of theft (a restaurant owner claimed that he had not paid his bill). Alekov
 was struck on the legs and back with a wooden truncheon andhas forensic evidence
 (a medical certificate) for the injuries he sustained. A complaint was filed with the
 Military Prosecutor's Office.
 The HRP also reported that on July 10 approximately 80 policemen raided the
 village of Mechka and beat more than 30 Roma with truncheons, broke down doors,
 and smashed windows and furniture in Roman houses. The policemen beat men,
 women, and children indiscriminately while insulting the villagers with ethnic slurs.
 Those beaten reported that the police showed no warrants (with one exception, ap-
 proximately 30 minutes before the real raid began) and gave no explanation for
 their actions. A 10-year-old boy's arm was fractured with a truncheon. A disabled
 resident who was unable to flee also was beaten. Altogether, despite initial difficul-
 ties in obtaining medical (forensic) certificates, 15 residents eventually obtained
 them, and 9 complaints were submitted to the Military Prosecutor's Office. By year's
 end, no action had been taken on the complaints.
 According to Ministry of Interior data, 106 cases of police brutality were con-
 firmed for the period June 1, 1997, to April 30, 1998. Legal proceedings were initi-
 ated in 44 cases, 4 officers were convicted, 26 officers were dismissed, and 63 were
 sanctioned. By comparison, MOI figures show that 21 complaints were filed regard-
 ing police brutality in 1996, 3 of which were judged justified. The police generally
 have refused to make investigative reports available to the public. The MOI statis-
 tics reflect only those complaints registered by the alleged victims. Human rights
 monitors report that they receive many more complaints from persons who are too
 intimidated to lodge an official complaint with the authorities.
 Reports continue that criminal suspects in police custody run a significant risk
 of being mistreated. Human rights observers fear that conditions in SIS detention
 facilities may be exceptionally poor, since they have been unable to obtain access
 to them to conduct inspections.
 There were fewer reports during the year of serious police abuses. Some police-
 men were punished for excesses, although the investigation process is not suffi-
 ciently expeditious or transparent. Changes in personnel and structures in the MOI,
 the prosecutor's office, and the Ministry of Justice all contributed to tightening con-
 trol and accountability. Minister of Interior Bogomil Bonev immediately disbanded
 the renegade "special police unit" following an egregious example of collective
 human rights abuse by the unit in July 1997. Bonev also implemented a "zero toler-
 ance" campaign during the year that apparently reduced police abuses. The Min-
 istry also recognized that outside training and long-term consultations with Western
 law enforcement agencies are instrumental in developing greater control and effec-
 tiveness in law enforcement.
 Conditions in some prisons are harsh and include severe overcrowding, inad-
 equate lavatory facilities, and insufficient heating and ventilation. Credible sources
 reported cases of brutality committed by prison guards against inmates; in some
 cases, prisoners who complained were placed in solitary confinement. The Bulgarian
 Helsinki Committee (BHC) reports that tuberculosis is a growing problem in pris-
 ons, especially in those that do not have their own in-house enterprises or agricul-
 tural production and hence lack the additional resources to purchase more food. The
 process by which prisoners may complain of substandard conditions or of mistreat-
 ment does not appear to function effectively.
 The Government cooperated fully with requests by independent observers to mon-
 itor conditions in those prisons under the authority of the Ministry of Justice. How-
 ever, this was not the case for the detention centers operated by the SIS (see Section
 1.d.).
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution provides for protection
 against arbitrary arrest and detention; however, police often arbitrarily detain and
 arrest street children, particularly Roma.
 The Constitution provides for access to legal counsel from the time of detention.
 Police normally obtain a warrant from a prosecutor prior to apprehending an indi-
 vidual; otherwise, in emergency circumstances judicial authorities must rule on the
 legality of a detention within 24 hours. Defendants have the right to visits by family
 members, to examine evidence, and to know the charges against them. Charges may
 not be made public without the permission of the chief prosecutor. Pretrial detention
 is limited to 2 months under normal circumstances, although this may be extended
 to 6 months by order of the chief prosecutor, who also may restart the process. In
 
 
 1184
 practice, persons often are detained for well over 6 months. In May Deputy Minister
 of Justice Zlatka Rousseva stated that some detainees have spent up to 2 years in
 prison without a trial. Rousseva publicly acknowledged that such prolonged pretrial
 detention constitutes a human rights violation. Under the terms of a 1997 amend-
 ment to the Code of Criminal Procedure, pretrial detention can last no more than
 a year or, if the alleged offense is punishable by over 15 years' imprisonment, life
 imprisonment, or capital punishment, no more than 2 years.
 As of July. 1, according to the Ministry of Justice, 993 inmates were in pretrial
 detention, 1,960 were on trial, and 8,861 were convicted (for a total inmate popu-
 lation of 11,814). These figures do not include prisoners held by the SIS, which re-
 ported that as of June 30 its detainees numbered 3,257, of which 842 were in pre-
 trial detention. The BHC reported that it again attempted without success in No-
 vember to gain access to the SIS's facilities in order to investigate allegations of
 abuse.
 In the event of a conviction, the time spent in pretrial detention is credited toward
 the sentence. The Constitution provides for bail, and some detainees have been re-
 leased under this provision, although bail is not used widely.
 The Government does not use forced exile.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-Under the Constitution, the judiciary is granted
 independent and coequal status with the legislature and executive branch; however,
 the judiciary continues to struggle with problems such as low salaries, understaff-
 ing, antiquated procedures, corruption, and a heavy backlog of cases. Partly as a
 legacy of communism and partly because of the court system's structural and per-
 sonnel problems, many citizens have little confidence in the judicial system. Human
 rights groups complain that local prosecutors and magistrates sometimes fail to pur-
 sue vigorously crimes committed against minorities. Many observers believe that re-
 forms are essential to establish a fair and impartial, as well as efficient, judicial sys-
 tem.
 Local observers contend that organized crime influences the prosecutor's office.
 Few organized crime figures have been prosecuted to date, but in 1997 the Govern-
 ment made the battle against organized crime a priority and reformed the Penal
 Code to that end. In August 1998, law enforcement authorities raided the head-
 quarters of a large conglomerate accused of trafficking in smuggled sugar to inves-
 tigate alleged links to organized crime, but the prosecutor's office canceled the
 search warrant while the raid was in progress. The MOI has requested and received
 assistance from Western countries in its efforts to close legal loopholes and strength-
 en enforcement capabilities against criminal economic groupings engaged in rack-
 eteering and other illegal activities.
 A new law passed by the National Assembly in November is intended to reform
 the judiciary and remove the more cumbersome aspects of its functioning, such as
 the long delays created by the referral of cases back and forth between different of-
 fices. It also increases executive branch oversight of judges and prosecutors. In Au-
 gust the Council of Eu'rope Parliamentary Assembly's Observation Committee ques-
 tioned some aspects of the law that the Committee believed could limit the inde-
 pendence of the judiciary.
 The court system consists of regional courts, district courts, and Supreme Courts
 of Cassation (civil and criminal appeal) and Administration. The Constitutional
 Court, which is separate from the rest of the court system, is empowered to rescind
 legislation that it considers unconstitutional, settle disputes over the conduct of gen-
 eral elections, and resolve conflicts over the division of powers between the various
 branches of government. Military courts handle cases involving military personnel
 and some cases involving national security matters. The Constitutional Court does
 not have specific jurisdiction in matters of military justice.
 Judges are appointed by the 25-member Supreme Judicial Council and, after serv-
 ing for 3 -years, may not be replaced except under limited, specified circumstances.
 This effective inability to replace judges virtually regardless of performance often
 has been cited as a hindrance to effective law enforcement. The 12 justices on the
 Constitutional Court are chosen for 9-year terms as follows: a third are elected by
 the National Assembly, a third appointed by the President, and a third elected by
 judicial authorities.
 The Constitution stipulates that all courts shall conduct hearings in public unless
 the proceedings involve state security or national secrets. No complaints were re-
 ported about limited access to courtroom proceedings. Defendants have the right to
 know the charges against them and are given ample time to prepare a defense. The
 right of appeal is'provided for and is used widely. Defendants in criminal proceed-
 ings have the right to confront witnesses and to have an attorney, provided by the
 state if necessary, in serious cases.
 
 
 1185
 Human rights observers consider "Educational Boarding Schools" (formerly known
 as "Labor Education Schools") to which problem children can be sent as little dif-
 ferent from penal institutions. However, since the schools are not considered prisons
 under the law, the procedures by which children are confined in these schools are
 not subject to minimal due process. Human rights monitoring groups such as the
 Bulgarian Lawyers for Human Rights criticize this denial of due process. Children
 sometimes appear alone despite the requirement that parents must attend hearings;
 the law expressly prohibits the right to an attorney at the hearing. Decisions in
 these cases are not subject to judicial review, and children typically stay in the Edu-
 cational Boarding Schools for 3 years or until they reach majority age, whichever
 occurs first. In 1996 the Parliament enacted legislation that provided for court re-
 view of sentences to such schools, set a limit of a 3-year stay, and addressed other
 problems in these institutions (see Section 5). Some observers dismiss this court re-
 view provision as a formality, since the child is not present to speak on his or her
 own behalf (nor is the defense lawyer or the child's parents).
 There was no rogress in a case begun in 1993 relating to the forced assimilation
 and expulsion o ethnic Turks in 1984-85 and 1989; one of the three defendants,
 former Communist dictator Todor Zhivkov, died in August.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution provides for the inviolability of the home, the right to choose one's
 place of work and residence, and the freedom and confidentiality of correspondence.
 Government authorities generally respect these provisions.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech
 and of the press, and the Government generally respects this right in practice. For
 most of the year, the legal situation for the media (beyond the constitutional provi-
 sions) remained unclear. However, with the passage of the media law in November
 the situation in the electronic media finally was regularized, after years of uncer-
 tainty and administrative ad hoc measures. How well the law functions was ex-
 pected to become clear during the course of 1999, when new licenses for frequencies
 are issued. Considerable concern remains among the media that the controlling
 boards established under this law and the law on telecommunications are not free
 of political control by the parliamentary majority party. Despite previous legal un-
 certainties, the broadcast media operated reasonably freely. Nevertheless, there
 were accusations of political censorship in February when an episode of the satirical
 television program "Hushove" (Bulgarian for exiles or outcasts) was canceled imme-
 diately following a critical and unflattering portrayal of the Government. Although
 the reason given by the director of Bulgarian National Television (BNT) for the
 show's cancellation was an- alleged failure to comply with advertising rules, others
 charged that the cancellation was a politically motivated vendetta.
 Among media professionals and the broader public, the belief persists that the
 Government exerts an unduly large influence on the media though official channels,
 i.e., the Radio and Television Council, and unofficially by influencing advertisers not
 to use media outlets that are too critical of government policy or officials. While
 such claims are widely made and believed, little hard evidence exists to document
 concrete examples of government intimidation of editors or their broadcasters.
 A variety of newspapers are published freely by political parties and other organi-
 zations representing the full spectrum of political opinion; many reflect the views
 of their ownership.
 According to the nongovernmental organization (NGO) Human Rights Watch, at
 least 11 violent attacks were carried out against' media representatives, including
 physical assaults and bombings of newspaper offices. Attempts to intimidate jour-
 nalists investigating corruption were thought to be the motivation for the attacks.
 Libel is punishable under the Criminal Code, and several human rights organiza-
 tions, as well as a majority of the journalistic community, believe that prosecutors
 use their authority to issue arrest warrants to intimidate free expression in the
 press, particularly when such expression is critical of the Prosecutor's Office. In re-
 cent years this law has been used sparingly, but there have been two cases in the
 last 2 years in which reporters have been convicted of libel and sentenced to prison
 terms or large fines. The Council of Europe Parliamentary Assembly's Observation
 Committee announced in August that it would review problems with media inde-
 pendence.
 Pending enactment of the new media legislation, national television and radio
 broadcasting both remained under parliamentary supervision. Some media observ-
 ers expressed concern that such parliamentary supervision fosters censorship and
 a lack of balance in the state-controlled media.
 
 
 . 1186
 Only the two state-owned national television channels, have nationwide coverage.
 The Government announced plans to close down one of the channels in the fall and
 to privatize it. Although privatization has yet to occur, the second channel imple-
 mented a gradual shutdown of its own programming, reducing original news pro uc-
 tion to 5 minutes per day and broadcasting archived programs and old movies the
 rest of the time. To date plans for the national television station to broadcast in
 Turkish have not been implemented. However, there is limited radio broadcasting
 in Turkish on the national radio's local affiliates in regions where there is a sizable
 Turkish-speaking population.
 Television and radio news programs on the state-owned media present opposition
 views, but opposition members claim that their activities and views are given less
 broadcast time and exposure than those of the ruling party. There are no formal
 restrictions on programming. Both television and radio provide a variety of news
 and public interest programming.
 Human Rights Watch reported that in March the national radio removed journal-
 ist Diana Yakulova from the air for a month for using anonymous information re-
 garding the Minister of the Interior. BNT dismissed Svetoslava Tadarakova in
 March for "statements in the media [which] ruin the good reputation of Bulgarian
 National Television."
 There are more than 30 independent radio stations (all local or regional). Most
 have licenses, but due to the fact that the new media law had yet to be implemented
 fully, these  tations are technically illegal, since their licenses expired and there
 was no valid mechanism for renewal. Some private stations still complain that the
 strength of their transmissions is restricted unduly, with the result that they cannot
 compete fully with national (state-owned) radio. All transmission facilities are
 owned by the central Government.
 Foreign government radio programs such as the British Broadcasting Corporation,
 Deutsche Welle, and- the Voice of America have good access to commercial radio fre-
 quencies.
 Private book publishing remained unhindered by political considerations.
 The Government respects academic freedom.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly'and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 the right to peaceful assembly, and-the Government generally respected this right
 in practice. The authorities require permits for rallies and assemblies held outdoors,
 but most legally registered organizations routinely were granted permission to as-
 semble. Vigorous political rallies and demonstrations were a common occurrence and
 generally took place without government interference. However, in April police
 broke up attempts by the unregistered, self-proclaimed Macedonian rights group,
 OMO-Ilinden, to hold a public demonstration near Rozhen. Police reportedly pre-
 vented OMO-Ilinden -members from marching to the grave of the Macedonian revo-
 lutionary leader Jane Sandanski; one protester claimed that police beat him and
 broke several teeth. Mayor Stefan Sofiyanski also banned an OMO-Ilinden dem-
 onstration in August in Sofia.'
 Police broke up Jehovah's Witnesses' meetings and services in February and in
 May in the city of Burgas, and in Kyustendil in May. Also in May, two members
 of Jehovah's Witnesses were each fined $280 (Lev 500,000-more than twice the av-
 erage monthly salary) by local authorities for a conducting a religious gathering be-
 hind closed doors in Plovdiv. Jehovah's Witnesses were formally registered on Octo-
 ber 7 (seeSection 2.c.).
 The Government has undertaken to respect the rights of individuals and groups
 to establish freely their own political parties or other political organizations. How-
 ever, there are constitutional and statutory restrictions that limit the right of asso-
 ciation and meaningful participation in the political process. For example, the Con-
 stitution forbids the formation of political parties along religious, ethnic, or racial
 lines and prohibits "citizens' associations" from engaging in political activity. This
 provision is designed to prevent the-development of parties based on a single ethnic
 or other group that could prove divisive for national unity by stirring up ethnic ten-
 sion for political purposes. Nonetheless, the mainly ethnic Turkish Movement for
 Rights and Freedoms (MRF) is represented in Parliament. The other major political
 parties generally accept the MRF'S right to participate in the political process, al-
 though former member of the National Asembly Roumen Vodenicharov challenged
 the MRF's legitimacy in a blatantly racist speech delivered at the funeral of former
 'dictator Todor Zhivkov in August (see Section 2.d.).
 The Constitution also prohibits organizations that threaten the country's terri-
 torial integrity or unity, or -that incite racial, ethnic, or religious hatred. The Gov-
 enment has refused since 1990 to register OMO-Ilinden, on the grounds that it is
 separatist. However, there were no reports of any prosecutions for simple member-
 ship in this group.
 
 
 1187
 
 c. Freedom of Religion.-Although the Constitution provides for freedom of reli-
 gion, the Government restricts this right in practice for some non-Orthodox religious
 groups. The government requirement that groups whose activities have a religious
 element register with the Council of Ministers remained an obstacle to the activity
 of some religious groups, such as the Unification Church, prior to or in the absence
 of registration. The lack of registration was an obstacle to the activities of Jehovah's
 Witnesses early in the year, prior to the group's registration in November. Local au-
 thorities cite the lack of registration as a pretext for interference against some
 groups and employ arbitrary harassment tactics against others. The ability of a
 number of religious groups to operate freely continued to come under attack, both
 as a result of action by local government authorities and because of public intoler-
 ance.
 The National Assembly passed a law on alternatives to military service in Octo-
 ber, which entered into force on January 1, 1999. Under this new law, alternative
 service is to be twice as long as military service (military service is 9 months for
 university graduates and 12 months for others). Passage of this legislation led to
 the registration of Jehovah's Witnesses. A member of Jehovah's Witnesses who re-
 fused to serve in the military was sentenced to a jail term before the registration
 occurred, but he is a pealing the verdict and is not in custody.
 The Ministry of Education introduced a course on religion in the secondary school
 curriculum beginning with the 1998-99 school year. Originally conceived as a "world
 religion" course that avoids endorsing any particular faith, members of other reli-
 gions, especially ethnic Turkish Moslems, maintain that the Bulgarian Orthodox
 Church receives privileged coverage in the textbooks. The religion course is optional
 and is not available at all schools.
 Numerous articles in a broad range of newspapers drew lurid and inaccurate pic-
 tres of the activities of non-Ortodox religious groups, attributing the breakup of
 families and drug abuse by youths to the practices of these groups and alleging that
 Evangelicals were drugging young children. Jehovah's Witnesses were subjected te
 a particularly negative press campaign in the port city of Burgas. In addition to the
 action taken by police in Burgas to break up gatherings of Jehovah's Witnesses in
 February, according to one report, police also confiscated religious books and leaf-
 lets. In May police broke up Jehovah's Witness gatherings in both Burgas and
 Kyustendil (see Sections 2.b. and 5). Two members of Jehovah's Witnesses were de-
 tained in Burgas in June for proselytizing. Mormon missionaries reported several
 incidents of police harassment. Although incidents involving police took place
 throughout the country, official harassment was worst in the cities of Burgas and
 Plovdiv, where local authorities disregarded the law by arbitrarily denying Mormons
 the right to proselytize (in Burgas) and to have a legally registered place of resi-
 dence (in both Burgas and Plovdiv). These incidents lend credence to charges by
 human rights observers that the police are monitoring and interfering with the ac-
 tivities of many religious groups.
 The Constitution designates Eastern Orthodox Christianity as the "traditional" re-
 ligion. The Government provides financial support for the Eastern Orthodox Church
 and other denominations that it considers to be "traditional." Along with the Ortho-
 dox Church, the Muslim, Catholic, and Jewish minority religious communities are
 generally perceived as maintaining a longstanding place in society and hence benefit
 from a relatively high degree of tolerance, as well as some government financial
 support.
 For most registered religious groups there were no restrictions on attendance at
 religious services or on private religious instruction. A school for imams, a Muslim
 cultural center, university theological faculties, and religious primary schools oper-
 ated freely. Bibles and other religious materials in the Bulgarian language were
 freely imported and printed on most occasions, and Muslim, Catholic, and Jewish
 publications were published on a regular basis. Nevertheless, police confiscated reli-
 gious literature during Jehovah's Witnesses' gatherings.
 During compulsory military service most Muslims are placed in construction units
 where they often perform commercial or maintenance work rather than serve in nor-
 mal military units. The mainly ethnic-Turkish MRF protests this practice (see Sec-
 tion 5).
 There were no indications that the Government discriminated against members
 of any religious group in making restitution to previous owners of properties that
 were nationalized during the Communist regime. The Government has in general
 actively supported property restitution to a group representing the Jewish commu-
 nity, although the return of two lucrative commercial Jewish communal properties
 continues to face administrative obstacles.
 At the Department of Theology of Sofia University all students are required to
 present a certificate of baptism from the Orthodox Church, and married couples
 
 
 1188
 
 must present a -marriage certificate.from the Church in order to enroll in the De-
 partment's classes. In 1996 two non-Orthodox applicants were denied admission to
 the Department when they were.unable to present such certificates. The applicants
 then appealed- to the local court, which decided in favor of both applicants. However,
 following the court decision the University changed its requirements, effectively fur-
 ther excluding both students.
 The schism that opened in the Orthodox Church in 1992 continued, and the Gov-
 ernment refused to recognize an alternative Patriarch elected by supporters in 1996.
 The Supreme Court ruled that the decision was unlawful, but the alternate Patri-
 arch remained unregistered. The Government nevertheless encouraged the feuding
 factions to heal their prolonged rift. By year's end, these efforts had not met with
 success.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Constitution provides for freedom of movement within the country
 and the right to leave it, and these rights are not limited in practice, with the excep-
 tion of border zones where access is limited for nonresidents (the border zones ex-
 tend 1.2 to 3 miles from each border). In November President Stoyanov vetoed the
 law on aliens over provisions that deny citizens the right to appeal refusal of a pass-
 port on national security grounds. Stoyanov stated that the bill violates human
 rights norms and that following 45 years of international isolation, the populace was
 sensitive to restrictions on foreign travel. Every citizen has the right to return to
 Bulgaria, may not be forcibly expatriated, and may not be deprived of citizenship
 acquired by birth. In the first half of the year, citizenship was restored to 286 appli-
 cants who lost their citizenship during the Communist era; 7 such applicants were
 refused on national security grounds.
 The Government grants asylum or refugee status in accordance with the stand-
 ards of the 1951 United Nations (U.N.) Convention Relating to the Status of Refu-
 gees and its 1967 Protocol. In the absence of a refugee law, the procedures followed
 by the governmental National Bureau for Territorial Asylum and Refugees (NBTAR)
 are regulated by an ordinance for granting and regulating refugee status. The Gov-
 ernment provides first asylum. However, domestic and international human rights
 organizations expressed concern over the Government's handling of asylum claims
 and reported that there may be cases in which bona fide refugees are turned away
 at the border and forced to return to countries where they fear persecution. The
 NBTAR asserts that it gives a fair hearing to all persons who seek asylum or refu-
 gee status but admits that there may be cases that do not come to its attention be-
 fore applicants are returned to the country from which they entered. For the period
 January 1 to August 31, the MOI reports that 2,843 persons were denied entry; it
 is not known how many of these requested asylum.
 The NBTAR reports that, from its inception in 1993 until June 30, a total of 2,367
 persons applied for asylum. In the first 5 months of. 1998, 367 applied, 30 were ap-
 proved, and 48 were refused; for 126 applicants the procedure was terminated (usu-
 ally because the applicant could not be found). Domestic and international human
 rights organizations complain that the adjudication process is slow; the office of the
 U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) notes that it can take up to 4
 years. The UNHCR, in cooperation with a local NGO, opened three transit centers
 in 1997 and 1998 in areas close to the Greek, Turkish, and Romanian borders. The
 Government opened a small reception center in Banya (in the Nova Zagora region,
 not far from the Greek and Turkish borders), also with assistance from the UNHCR.
 Plans to open a reception center at the-Sofia airport have been delayed due to a
 lack of funding.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment-
 Citizens have the right to change their government and head of state through the
 election of the President and of the members of the National Assembly, although
 the Constitutional prohibition of parties formed on ethnic, racial, or religious lines
 has the effect of circumscribing access to the political party process for some groups
 (see Section 2.b.), particularly those Roma who have expressed a desire to create
 their own party. Suffrage is universal at the age of 18.
 No legal restrictions hinder the participation of women in government and poli-
 tics, although they are underrepresented. Women hold just under 11 percent of the
 seats in the current Parliament. However, a number of women hold elective and ap-
 pointive office at high levels, including three cabinet-level posts and several key po-
 sitions in Parliament. The Minister of Foreign Affairs and the leader of the UDF
 parliamentary group (the dominant party in the Government) are both women.
 No legal restrictions hinder the participation of minorities in politics, apart from
 the prohibition of ethnically, racially, or religiously based parties. However, while
 
 
 1189
 ethnic Turks' representation in the National Assembly is close to commensurate
 with their share of population, there are no Romani members of Parliament. Both
 groups are underrepresented in appointed governmental positions, especially leader-
 ship positions.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Local and international human rights groups operate freely, investigating and
 publishing their findings on human rights cases. Government officials, especially
 local officials, occasionally are reluctant to provide information or active cooperation.
 The failure of the SIS to allow access by human rights groups to its detention cen-
 ters is of particular concern.
 The National Assembly has a committee on human rights and religions.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution provides for individual rights, equality, and protection against
 discrimination, but in practice discrimination still exists, particularly against Roma
 and women. Local human rights groups reported progress in religious tolerance
 among the publicat large and among central government officials and institutions,
 although problems of intolerance persist in some areas as a result of local govern-
 ment or private action.
 Women.-Domestic abuse is a serious and common problem, but there are no offi-
 cial statistics on its occurrence. Spousal rape is a crime but rarely is prosecuted.
 The law exempts from state prosecution certain types of assault if committed by a
 family member, and the Government does not assist in prosecuting crimes of domes-
 tic assault unless the woman has been killed or injured permanently. Courts and
 prosecutors tend to view domestic abuse as a family rather than criminal problem,
 and in most cases victims of domestic violence take refuge with family or friends
 rather than approach the authorities. No government agencies provide shelter or
 counseling for such persons, although the municipality of Sofia promised a building
 to the Animus Association (AA), an NGO that offers help and support to female vic-
 tims of violence, to use as a shelter for abused women. The courts prosecute rape,
 although it remains an underreported crime because some stigma still attaches to
 the victim. The maximum sentence for rape is 8 years; convicted offenders often re-
 ceive a lesser sentence or early-parole. MOI figures show that during the first half
 of the year, 309 rapes and 58 attempted rapes were reported.
 The AA reported 348 cases of domestic violence, 35 cases of sexual violence, and
 30 cases of trafficking in womdn between January and August. Its total caseload
 thus increased several times over the same period the year before. Possible expla-
 nations for this increase include not only a successful publicity campaign but also
 an evolution in attitudes towards violence against women. Women apparently are
 now more inclined to seek help from such organizations. The actual incidence of
 each form of violence is certainly much higher, as these represent those cases in
 which the victim (or, in some trafficking cases, an overseas women's group) was
 willing and able to contact the AA.
 In 1997 the Government enacted a law against trafficking in women. The AA re-
 ports that, according to foreign women's organizations, Bulgarian women constitute
 one of the largest groups of victims of forced prostitution in Western and Central
 Europe. Typically, women are lured away with offers of foreign jobs as nannies,
 waitresses, dancers, shop assistants, or fruit pickers and then discover that virtual
 indentured servitude in prostitution awaits. The AA also reports that destinations
 for trafficked women include Cyprus, Greece, Turkey, Italy, Germany, Poland, Bel-
 gium, the Netherlands, the Czech Republic, Canada, and Macedonia, all of which
 have been used either for transit or "sale" of victims. On occasion there were
 unconfirmed reports of the involvement of local officials in trafficking in some areas.
 Women reportedly were trafficked into Bulgaria from the former Soviet Union and
 Macedonia, also for forced prostitution. A 1997 amendement to the Penal Code on
 trafficking in women introduced longer prison sentences (to existing kidnaping pen-
 alties already in force) in those cases where the victim is under 18 years of age,
 is offered to another person for sexual abuse, or is trafficked abroad for sexual
 abuse. However, it is not yet clear how the amendment has been implemented.
 Technical and bureaucratic obstacles hamper government assistance to female vic-
 tims of violence. Many victims of trafficking and forced prostitution are too young
 to have worked previously; the lack of previous work experience disqualifies them
 from receiving social security assistance. If they are runaways.with no registered
 address to which they can return, they are ineligible for humanitarian assistance.
 
 
 1190
 Victims are not encouraged to file complaints, as there is no mechanism in place
 to protect witnesses.
 Some interested NGO's believe that sexual harassment is a problem; it is not cur-
 rently illegal.
 Many of the approximately 30 women's organizations are closely associated with
 political parties or have primarily professional agendas. Some-observers believe that
 women's organizations tend to be associated with political parties or professional
 groups because feminism has negative societal connotations. Of those organizations
 that exist mainly to defend -women's interests, the two largest are the Women's
 Democratic Union in Bulgaria,- heir to the group that existed under the Communist
 dictatorship, and the Bulgarian Women's Association, which disappeared under com-
 munism but has reemerged with chapters in a number of cities.
 The Constitution forbids privileges or restrictions of rights on the basis of sex, and
 women are not impeded from owning or managing businesses, land, or other real
 property and do not suffer from discrimination under inheritance laws. However,
 women face discrimination both in terms of job recruitment and the likelihood of
 layoffs. Official figures show the rate of unemployment for women to be higher than
 that for men. Women are much more likely than men to be employed in low-wage
 jobs requiring little education, although statistics show that women are equally like-
 ly to attend university. However, fewer girls than boys are attending schools, espe-
 cially among minorities. Women generally continue to have primary responsibility
 for child rearing and housekeeping even if they are employed outside the home.
 There are liberal provisions for paid maternity leave. However, in some cases these
 actually may work against employers' willingness to hire and retain female employ-
 ees, especially in the private sector.
 No special government programs address economic discrimination or integrate
 women better into the mainstream of society and the economy.
 Children.-The Government generally is committed to protecting children's wel-
 fare but, with limited resources, falls short in several areas. It maintains, for exam-
 ple, a sizable network of orphanages throughout the country. However, many of the
 orphanages are in disrepair and lack proper facilities. Government efforts in edu-
 cation and health have been constrained by serious budgetary limitations and by
 outmoded social care structures. The Constitution provides for mandatory school at-
 tendance until the age of 16. However, fewer girls than boys are attending school,
 especially among minorities.
 Credible sources report that there is no provision for, due process of law for
 Romani and other juveniles when they are detained in Labor Education Schools run
 by the Ministry of Education. Living conditions at these reform schools'are poor, of-
 fering few medical, educational, or social services. The Labor Education School at
 Slavovitsa has been the target of the harshest criticism. Generally, staff members
 at many such institutions lack the proper qualifications and training to care for the
 children adequately. Degrading and severe punishment, such as the shaving of a
 child's head, reduction in diet, severe beatings, and long periods of solitary confine-
 ment, are common at the schools. In 1996 the Ministry of Education acknowledged
 problems at the schools and attributed the cause to a lack of funding. In 1996 Par-
 liament enacted legislation providing for court review of sentencing to such schools
 and addressing other problens in the reform school system (see Section I.e.).
 The vast majority of children are free from societal abuse, although some Romani
 children are frequent targets of-skinhead violence and arbitrary police detention; the
 homeless or abandoned were particularly vulnerable. Family or community mem-
 bers forced some Romani minors into prostitution. Police made little effort to ad-
 dress these problems. The National Police Directorate announced in June that juve-
 nile delinquency was halved in the first 5 months of the year compared with the
 same period during the previous year. Some observers believe that there is a grow-
 ing trend toward the use of children in prostitution, burglaries, and narcotics dis-
 tribution.
 People With Disabilities.-Disabled persons by law receive a range of financial as-
 sistance, including free public transportation, reduced prices on modified auto-
 mobiles, and free equipment such as wheelchairs. However, as in other areas, budg-
 etary constraints mean that such payments occasionally fall behind. Disabled indi-
 viduals have access to university training and to housing and employment, but ar-
 chitectural barriers are a great hindrance in most older buildings. For example,
 there are no elevators in schools or universities. In 1997 the Rehabilitation and So-
 cial Integration Fund -was established to assist the disabled. According to the direc-
 tor of this new government body, 82 percent of the disabled are unemployed. Work-
 ers with disabilities are entitled to shorter working hours, which often leads to dis-
 crimination against them in hiring practices. According to the law, any enterprise
 employing more than 50 persons must hire a certain number of disabled workers
 
 
 1191
 (between 3 and 10 percent, depending on the industry). Those who fail to do so must
 pay a fine, the proceeds of which go to a fund for the disabled. Nevertheless, due
 to low fines and delays in the judicial system, collection rates are extremely low.
 The Rehabilitation and Social Integration Fund is developing a national draft strat-
 egy to improve conditions for the disabled.
 In February the city of Plovdiv received two minibuses for use in trans porting per-
 sons with disabilities; the European Union's PHARE program financed the purchase
 of the vehicles. Recent public works have taken the needs of the disabled into ac-
 count. When a major inner city Sofia boulevard was rebuilt in 1998, lower sidewalk
 access was provided for wheelchairs. Sofia's new subway also was designed for
 wheelchair access. Nevertheless, enforcement of a 1995 law requiring improved ac-
 cess for the disabled has lagged as far as existing, unrenovated buildings are con-
 cerned.
 Policies and public attitudes prevalent during the Communist era, which sepa-
 rated mentally and physically disabled persons, including very young children, from
 the rest of society have persisted. Some complain that the effective segregation of
 disabled children into special schools has lowered the quality of their education.
 Religious Minorities.-Discrimination, harassment, and general public intolerance
 of "nontraditional" religious minorities (i.e., the great majority of Protestant Chris-
 tian religions) remained a problem, although the number of reported incidents de-
 creased during the year. Deep-rooted suspicion of Evangelical denominations is
 widespread and pervasive across the political spectrum. Often cloaked in a veneer
 of "patriotism," intolerance of the religious beliefs of others enjoys widespread popu-
 larity. Such mainstream public pressure for the containment of "foreign religious
 sects" inevitably influences policymakers. Nevertheless, human rights observers
 agreed that such discrimination lessened somewhat during the year as the populace
 appeared to adapt to the existence of previously unfamiliar religions.
 Certain religions, including groups denied registration and those officially reg-
 istered, faced discriminatory practices (see Sections 2.b and 2.c.), despite registered
 groups' full compliance with the law, and sometimes encountered hostility from the
 press, segments of the public, and certain government officials.
 National/RaciallEthnic Minorities.-Ethnic Turks constitute almost 10 percent of
 the population. Although estimates of the Romani population vary widely, several
 experts put it at about 6 to 7 percent. Ethnic Bulgarian Muslims or "Pomaks" are
 a distinct group of Slavic descent, constituting 2 to 3 percent of the population,
 whose ancestors converted from Orthodox Christianity to Islam. Most are Muslim,
 although a number have become atheists or converted back to Christianity. These
 are the country's largest minorities. There are no restrictions on speaking Turkish
 in public or the use of non-Slavic names. In July 1997 President Stoyanov apolo-
 gized to Turkey and the Muslim community for the Communist-era "Regeneration
 Process" under which Turkish names were changed forcibly to Slavic names.
 Voluntary Turkish-language classes in public schools, funded by the Government,
 continued in areas with significant Turkish-speaking populations, although some ob-
 servers complained that the Government was discouraging optional language classes
 in areas with large concentrations of Muslims. In April a Ministry of Education spe-
 cialist estimated that approximately 40,000 children now study Turkish. Some eth-
 nic Turkish leaders, mainly in the MRF, demanded that Turkish-language classes
 be made compulsory in areas with significant ethnic Turkish populations, but the
 Government has resisted this effort.
 In the 1992 census 3.4 percent of the population identified itself as Romani. The
 real figure is probably closer to 6 or 7 percent, since many persons of Romani de-
 scent tend to identify themselves to the authorities as ethnic Turks or Bulgarians.
 Romani groups continued to be divided among themselves, although several groups
 had some success in presenting Romani issues to the Government. In June Prime
 Minister Kostov announced that his UDF Party would draft a long-term program
 to integrate ethnic and religious minorities into the country's sociopolitical and eco-
 nomic life. In August a Roma community center was opened in a Sofia neighbor-
 hood, with Vice President Todor Kavaldjiev in attendance.
 As individuals and as an ethnic goup, Roma faced high levels of discrimination.
 In August former Member of Parhament Roumen Vodenicharov made blatantly
 anti-Roma and anti-Semitic remarks at the funeral of former Communist dictator
 Todor Zhivkov. President Stoyanov quickly condemned Vodenicharov's remarks as
 "outspokenly Fascist," and both the Zhivkov family and the Bulgarian Socialist
 Party (BSP), on whose list Vodenicharov previously was elected to the National As-
 sembly, disavowed Vodenicharov's statement.
 Attacks by private citizens on Roma continued. In May skinheads attacked eight
 Romani boys in an abandoned building in downtown Sofia. One of the boys fell to
 his death from a window; according to the other boys who witnessed his fatal fall,
 
 
 1192
 he was pushed by the skinheads. President Stoyanov sent his personal representa-
 tive to visit the deceased boy's family to express sympathy over the racially moti-
 vated attack. One suspect was arrested, but he was released shortly thereafter for
 lack of evidence; no further arrests have been made.
 On March 4, a 10-year-old Romani girl named Minka Stoyanova was shot to death
 in her home in Rozino by private security guards after her father was accused of
 theft. Although a murder investigation is pending, the two guards accused of the
 killing had not-been taken into custody by year's end.
 On March 1, following an altercation between two Romani girls and two non-
 Romani males in the village of Hadji Dimitrovo, a group of 40 to 50 persons from
 the village attacked Roma living in a separate neighborhood. Witnesses said that
 the attackers were armed with rifles, pickaxes, and iron bars, and that they fired
 shots. One local Rom suffered a fractured skull, and another was beaten with a
 metal implement. There were also-reports that some members of the self-styled vigi-
 lante group attempted to molest sexually the daughters of the households that they
 broke into. No arrests were made in the case by year's end.
 Police harass, physically abuse, and arbitrarily arrest Romani street children (see
 Sections 1.c. and 1.d.). Little progress has been made in cases of violence against
 Roma during previous years, and these largely remain in the investigatory phase.
 Roma encounter difficulties applying for social benefits, and rural Roma� are dis-
 couraged from claiming land to which they are entitled under the law disbanding
 agricultural collectives. Many Roma and other observers made credible allegations
 that the quality of education offered to Romani children is inferior to that afforded
 most other students. For example, Bulgaria has 34 all-Roma schools; according to
 one estimate, only half of all students at these schools attend class regularly. The
 Government has been largely unsuccessful in attracting and keeping many Romani
 children in school. Poverty has led to widespread school. truancy as many children
 in Romani ghettos cannot afford shoes or basic-school supplies and turn to begging,
 prostitution, and petty crime-on the streets.
 Workplace discrimination: against minorities continued to be a problem, especially
 for Roma. Employers justify such discrimination on the basis that most Roma have
 only elementary education and little training. In June a Rom set fire to himself in
 front of the Loin town hall- to protest his unemployment and inability to feed his
 children. Local firefighters were present on the scene and quickly extinguished the
 flames. A spokesman for the Romani protestors in Lom explained that Roma in Loin
 had not received social assistance payments for 5months, faced general societal dis-
 crimination, and were disappointed that a construction contract had been awarded
 recently without the stipulation that local labor be employed.
 During compulsory military service most Roma (and Muslims) are shunted into
 units where they often perform commercial, military construction, or maintenance
 work rather than serve in normal military units (see Section 2.c.). The MRF pro-
 tested this practice, as did human rights groups and labor observers who cited it
 as a violation of International Labor Organization. (ILO) accords. There was specula-
 tion that the National Assembly's ratification in June of the ILO Convention on the
 Eradication of Forced Labor would mean the demise of the construction troops, but
 this had not happened by year's end. There are only a few ethnic Turkish, Pomak,
 and Romani officers in the military and an insignificant number of high-ranking of-
 ficers of the Muslim faith.
 Ethnic Turkish politicians maintain that,- although their community's popularly
 elected representation in the National Assembly is roughly commensurate with its
 size, ethnic Turks are woefully underrepresented in appointed positions in the gov-
 ernment.
 The National Council on Ethnic and Demographic Issues was founded in Decem-
 ber 1997. This organization serves as an advisory group to the Council of Ministers
 and reports directly to it. In April the Council announced that it would study the
 state of the Roma community.
 Several thousand Bulgarians, mainly in the southwest, identify themselves as eth-
 nic Macedonians, most for historical and geographical reasons. Members of the two
 unregistered organizations that purport to defend their interests, OMO-Ilinden and
 TMO-Ilinden, are believed-to number in the hundreds (see Section 2.b.). The Gov-
 ernment does not recognize Macedonians as a distinct ethnic group, and the group
 is not enumerated in official government- statistics.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution provides for the right of all work-
 ers to form or join trade unions of their own choice, and this right apparently was
 exercised freely. Estimates of the unionized share of the work force range from 30
 
 
 1193
 to 50 percent. This share continues to shrink as large firms lay off workers, and
 most new positions appear in small, nonunionized businesses.
 The two large trade union confederations are the Confederation of Independent
 Trade Unions of Bulgaria (CITUB) and Podkrepa. The Government does not control
 the CITUB, successor to the trade union controlled by the former Communist re-
 gime. Podkrepa, an independent confederation created in 1989, was one of the earli-
 est opposition forces but is no longer a member of the UDF Party. In 1995 a third
 trade union confederation, the Community of Free Union Organizations in Bulgaria
 (CFOUB), was admitted to the National Tripartite Coordinatior Council (NTCC),
 which includes employers and the government (see Section 6.b.). In 1996 a new
 labor union/civic organization called Prmyana (Bulgarian for "change") was found-
 ed with the explicit goal of removing the BSP from power via early elections. Al-
 though never officially registered as a labor union, Promyana originally attracted
 members of various professions and trades to its ranks but was weakened by inter-
 nal strife in mid-1998.
 The Government passed a law requiring doctors and dentists to join a union that
 the Government established without consulting them. The law is unpopular with
 health care professionals, who see its inception as autocratic and who claim it vio-
 lates the right to free association, but it has not been found illegal. Some claim that
 the law violates ILO Convention 87 on freedom of association and the right to orga-
 nize.
 The 1992 Labor Code recognizes the right to strike when other means of conflict
 resolution have been exhausted, but "political strikes" are forbidden. Workers in es-
 sential services (primarily the military and the police) also are subject to a blanket
 prohibition against striking, although such workers on occasion effectively held
 strikes, during which they stopped or slowed their activities for an hour or two.
 On most occasions, the Government generally did not interfere with the right to
 strike when strikes were deemed legal, and several work stoppages took place. How-
 ever, on March 24 a controversial event occurred at the Plama refinery in Pleven.
 Striking workers, who had not been p aid since December 1997, occupied the facility
 and blocked egress for the company director, who was in his office. The police inter-
 vened to allow the director to leave his office and in so doing injured some workers
 when physical violence ensued. Many workers present claim that the police used ex-
 cessive force and beat nonviolent protesters, but the MOI insisted that the action
 was legal and necessary to allow the director safe passage.
 The Podkrepa labor union complained that an amendment to a 1990 law, passed
 in March 1998, facilitated the Government's ability to declare a strike illegal. Under
 this new amendment, workers no longer have the right to appeal when a strike is
 declared illegal. Podkrepa maintains that this provision is unconstitutional and vio-
 lates ILO Convention 87 on the right to organize and and Convention 98 on the
 right to bargain collectively.
 The Labor Code's prohibitions against antiunion discrimination include a 6-month
 period for redress against dismissal as a form of retribution. However, there is no
 mechanism other than the courts for resolving complaints, and the burden of proof
 in such a case rests entirely on the employee.
 No restrictions limit affiliation or contact with international labor organizations,
 and unions actively exercise this right.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The Labor Code institutes
 collective bargaining, which was practiced nationally and on the local level. The
 legal prohibition against striking for key public sector employees weakens their bar-
 gaining position; however, these groups were able to influence negotiations by stag-
 ing protests and engaging in other pressure tactics without going on strike. Labor
 unions complained that while the legal structure for collective bargaining was ade-
 quate, many employers failed to bargain in good faith or to adhere to agreements
 that were concluded. Labor observers viewed the Government's enforcement of labor
 contracts as inadequate.
 In several instances an employer was found guilty of antiunion discrimination,
 but the employers appealed the decisions. The backlog of cases in the legal system
 delayed further action, effectively postponing, perhaps indefinitely, redress of work-
 ers' grievances.
 The same obligation of collective bargaining and adherence to labor standards
 prevails in the six export processing zones, and unions may organize workers in
 these areas.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Constitution prohibits forced
 or compulsory labor, including that performed by children. However, there were re-
 ports of such practices. In 1997 the BHC issued a report on the use of forced child
 labor at the Slavovitsa Boys' Reform School to make articles for sale. An investiga-
 tion by the Ministry of Education into this practice is under way. Many observers
 
 
 1194
 argued that the practice of shunting minority and conscientious-objector military
 draftees into work units that often carry out commercial construction and mainte-
 nance projects is a form of compulsory labor (see Sections 2.c. and 5).
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment.-The
 Labor Code sets the minimum age for employment at 16 years; the minimum age
 for dangerous work is set at 18 years. Employers and the Ministry of Labor and
 Social Policy (MLSP) are responsible for enforcing these provisions. Child labor laws
 are enforced well in the formal sector, but;some observers believe that children in-
 creasingly are exploited in certain industries (especially small family-owned shops,
 construction, and periodical sales) and by organized crime (notably for prostitution
 and distribution of narcotics). According to a survey conducted by the MLSP in
 1998, more than 50,000 children under the age of 16 are believed to be employed
 illegally. Dr. Zhelyasko Hristov, president of the CITUB labor union, estimated the
 total number of illegally employed children as at least twice that number. In April
 the first-ever fine was imposed on an employer of illegal child labor. Underage em-
 ployment in the informal and agriculturalsector s beieved to be increasing as col-
 lective farms are broken up and the private setor continues to grow. In addition,
 children are known to work on family-owned tobacco farms.
 As children are legally not permitted to work, and the Constitution forbids forced
 or compulsory labor for all, forced and bonded labor by children also is forbidden
 by law (see Section 6.c.).
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The national monthly minimum  wage is-the
 proximately $32 (Lev 53,500), which is not enough to provide a worker and fapil
 with a decent standard of living. Nonpayment of wages and wage payments in ar-
 rears continue to be a problem with certain employers, although the Government
 has declared the amelioration of this problem a top priority. The Constitution stipu-
 lates the right to social security and welfare aid assistance for the temporarily un-
 employed, although in'practice such assistance is often late.
 The Labor Code provides for a standard workweek of 40 hours with at least one
 24-hour rest period per week. The MLSP is responsible for enforcing both the mini-
 mum  wage and the standard workweek. Enforcement generally is effective in the
 state sector (although there are reports th natte-run enterprises fall into arrears
 on salary payments to their employees if the firms incur losses) but is weaker in
 the emerging private sector.
 A national labor safety program  exists, with standards established by the Labor
 Code. The Constitution states that employees are entited to healthy and non-
 hazardous working conditions. The MLSP is responsible for enforcing these provi-
 sions. Conditions in many cases worsened owing to budget stringencies and a grow-
 ing private sector that labor inspectors do not yet supervise effectively. Protective
 clothing often is absent from hazardous areas (goggles for welders, helmets for con-
 struction workers, etc.), since employers oiften imply that payment for such meas-
 ures would have to be deducted from the budget used to pay workers' wages. The
 overall standard of living of workers stabilized in 1998 after suffering a severe
 downturn during the economic decline of late 1996 and early 1997. The pervasive
 economic crisis and imminent, long-overdue privatizations continue to create a
 heightened fear of unemployment, leading to reluctance on the part of workers to
 pursue wage and safet demands. Under the Labor Code, employees have the right
 to remove themselves from work situations that present a serious or immediate dan-
 ger to life or health without jeopardizing their continued employment. In practice
 refusal to work in situations with relatively high accident rates or associated chronic
 health problems would result inthe loss of employment for many workers.
