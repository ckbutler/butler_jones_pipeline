 ECUADOR
 Ecuador is a constitutional republic with a president and a 121-member unicam-
 eral legislature that was chosen in free elections on May 31. On July 12, voters
 elected President Jamil Mahuad, who took office on August 10 and is to serve
 through January 2003. A national constituent assembly approved extensive con-
 stitutional reforms, which also took effect on August 10. The reforms included the
 termination of the Congress' power to dismiss cabinet ministers and the reduction
 of fringe parties' influence in the Congress. Members of the Supreme Court preside
 over a judiciary that is constitutionally independent, but in practice susceptible to
 outside pressure.
 The military enjoys substantial autonomy, reinforced by guaranteed revenues
 from the nation's oil exports, as well as from civil aviation, shipping, and other com-
 mercial sectors. The military has maintained a low profile in domestic politics since
 the return to constitutional rule in 1979. The National Police, responsible for domes-
 tic law enforcement and maintenance of internal order, falls under the civilian Min-
 istry of Government and Police. There continued to be credible allegations of human
 rights abuses by the police and, in some isolated cases, members of the military.
 The economy is based on private enterprise, although there continued to be heavy
 government involvement in key sectors such as petroleum, utilities, and aviation.
 The per capita gross domestic product of $1,612 provides most of the population
 with a low standard of living. According to the World Bank, about 60 percent of citi-
 zens live in poverty; half of these live in extreme poverty. The inflation rate for the
 year was 45 percent. The principal exports are oil, bananas, and shrimp, which are
 the country's leading sources of foreign exchange. Manufacturing for regional export
 markets is of growing importance. Most citizens are employed in the urban informal
 sector or as rural agricultural workers; rural poverty is extensive, and underemploy-
 ment is high.
 The most fundamental human rights abuse stems from shortcomings in the politi-
 cized, inefficient, and corrupt legal and judicial system. Persons are subject to arbi-
 trary arrest; once incarcerated, they may wait years before being convicted or ac-
 quitted unless they pay bribes. More than one-half the prisoners in jail have not
 
 
 608
 been formally sentenced. Other human rights abuses included isolated instances of
 extrajudicial killings; torture and other mistreatment of prisoners and detainees by
 the police; poor prison conditions; and violence and-pervasive discrimination against
 women, Afro-Ecuadorians, 'and indigenous peo le. The Government failed to pros-
 ecute and punish human rights abusers. The Supreme Court conducted open com-
 petitions to fill appellate judge positions and, at year's end, a newly constituted Ju-
 dicial Council had begun to function, charged with modernizin the judicial system.
 In September Congress elected a new Ombudsman, who is a former Attorney Cen-
 eral and a strong human rights advocate known for his independene.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Kllling.-There were no reports of politically
 motivated killings. There continued to be credible reports of police involvement in
 extrajudicial killings. Through late September, the Ecumenical Committee for
 Human Rights (CEDHU) reported a total of 11 extrajudicial killings. Police who re-
 portedly were drunk killed four persons. In addition to the 11 persons killed by the
 police, 3 other persons were shot and killed by assailants identified as members of
 citizen groups known as neighborhood brigades. (Neighborhood brigades are civic
 defense groups organized by the national police to provide an anticrime presence in
 neighborhoods. They are not authorized to carry firearms.)
 In Guayas province in January, after rural police had cleared a group of youths
 off the streets in the La Bocana neighborhood, a crowd closed in on the -police sta-
 tion. Police fired shots from the station, killing Jose Ignacio Moreno Castro and
 wounding two others.
 In May in Guayaquil, police shot and killed Wilter Arturo Guadamud Macias and
 Wilson Tomala Guzman. Onlookers told family members that the police arrested the
 two men and took them into custody; the police claimed that the two men were in-
 jured in a gun-battle, arrested, and died in transit.
 Later in May, also in Guayaquil, a drunken policeman shot and killed William
 Robles and wounded Geovanny Oviedo and Victor Robles when they came toRobles'
 assistance.
 In late May, in Esmeraldas province, a drunken policeman detained Wilton
 Estupinan by shooting him in the leg, claiming that Estupinan had escaped earlier
 from jail. Estupinan was then been n and jailed. The next day, he was moved to
 the city of Esmeraldas, briefly treated in a hospital, then jailed again, before his
 condition worsened and he was returned to the hospital where he died on May 27.
 In June witnesses reported that five rural police in Guayas province arrested
 Leonardo Pita in a brothel and put him in a police car. Witnesses reported hearing
 a shot and later found Pita's body near the site. Pita's family filed a complaint in
 police court against those responsible for his death.
 In June in Los Rios province, two rural policemen, who had earlier seized an ille-
 gal gun from a nightelub patroni, were involved in a dispute with that patron's La-
 ther, Fernando Limones,' who was accompanied by Tito Vera. Police shot and killed
 Vera and wounded Limones, who later died of his wounds. Police subsequently shot
 and killed Vera's brother Julian, according to witesses.
 In June in Guayaquil, two drunken policemen who had attempted to force taxi
 driver Jose Franc to drive them attempted to take his cab and, when he resisted,
 shot him fatally.
 In July in Los Rios province, drunken policemen ordered youths offa street corner
 at 5 am, and when an argument ensued, the police shot and killed Javier Torres.
 In October during violent antigovernment demonstrations, a stray bullet allegedly
 fired by a naval infantry soldier struck and killed one person in Guayaquil. A police-
 man was killed in Manabi when a hand grenade seized from protesters exploded in
 his hands. An innocent bystander was strck and killed by a stray bullet in
 Esmeraldas. A woman was struck and killed by a motor vehicle while crossing the
 street aftr fleeing a demonstration.
 In Guayas in March witnesses reported to CEDHU that members of a neighbor-
 hood brigade shot and killed Jimmy Olvera. In April witnesses in Guayas reported
 that men whom they identified as members of another neighborhood brigade, de-
 spite the fact that the assailants' faces were covered, shot and kiled Javier
 Gavilanez and Virgilio Davila and wounded Cesar Lastra.   e
 During the year the Government resolved some lawsuits arising from extrajudicial
 killings by military and police officers in past years. The Government recognized of-
 ficial responsibility for the unlawful killing of Cosuela Benavides, for the dis-
 appearances and presumed deaths of the Restrepo brothers, and for the fatal shoot-
 ing of Esteban Villacreses. Following a finding of official Wrongdoing by the Inter-
 
 
 609
 American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR) in the Benavides case, the Gov-
 ernment paid an indemnity to both the Benavides and Restrepo families. In the
 later case, the police officer responsible was sentenced to 10 years' imprisonment
 (see also Section 1.d.).
 Authorities within the police justice system charged police officers in the January
 1997 killing of three prisoners who had allegedly escaped from the penitentiary in
 Guayaquil. The case was pending at year's end.
 There were also instances in which citizens took the law into their own hands,
 inciting mob violence that resulted in lynchings and burnings of suspected criminals
 (see Section i.e.). Mobs killed 24 crime suspects in 1997 and lynched 12 in the first
 5 months of 1998; individual lynchings continue to occur in all parts of the country.
 Dozens of townspeople helped beat murder suspect Washington Piloso to death in
 June in the town of Yaguachi. Residents caught Piloso on June 20 and accused him
 of killing an off-duty police officer during a robbery. They stripped him to his under-
 wear and kicked him brutally while he crawled on the dirt street, police reported.
 The mob doused him with gasoline and was about to burn him alive when police
 intervened. Piloso died 2 hours later in a hospital. No one identified the attackers.
 According to Amnesty International, on November 26 in Quito, eight unknown
 men kidnaped Saul Filormo Canar Pauta, a leader of the Ecuadorean Confederation
 of United Working Class Organizations. On December 3, a municipal worker found
 his body in a trash dump in Latacunga. His hands and feet were tied and his body
 showed signs of torture. Authorities suspect that he may have been killed by private
 landowners in retaliation for his activities organizing land invasions by squatters.
 An investigation was pending at yea~s end.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 There was no progress in resolving the January 1997 disappearance of Angel
 Heriberto Hinojoza.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Although the law prohibits torture and similar forms of intimidation and punish-
 ment, police continued to abuse suspects and prisoners, usually with impunity. In
 February bank guards in Quito arrested Guillermo Travez on suspicion of check
 fraud. The bank guards took him to the police station in the distant town of Tulcan
 and, en route, allegedly tortured him in an attempt to make him confess to the
 crimes. Police investigators also were reported to have abused Travez before he was
 released after a habeas corpus petition had been presented on his behalf. However,
 military police seized him again before he could leave.
 The CEDHU has published one detailed report on suspects who identified specific
 policemen as having tortured them. In most cases, the police appeared to have
 abused such persons during investigations of ordinary street crime. The victims re-
 ported that the police beat them, burned them with cigarettes, applied electric
 shocks, or threatened them psychologically. There were also 13 reports of incidents
 involving physical mistreatment.
 Conditions in detention centers generally continued to be poor. Prisons in the
 tropical coastal areas tend to be worse than those in the temperate highlands. Over-
 crowding is a chronic problem, although conditions are notably better in the wom-
 en's prison in Quit than in other facilities. Prison overcrowding was reduced slight-
 ly by the release of several hundred drug addicts charged only with possession and
 prisoners charged with minor offenses who had been held in preventive custody for
 more than a year. The Constitution that took effect in August requires that pris-
 oners charged with lesser offenses (carrying a maximum sentence of 5 years) and
 who have been detained for more than 1 year without a sentence shall obtain their
 freedom immediately. There are no separate facilities for hard-core or dangerous
 criminals, nor are there effective rehabilitation programs. New prisons have not
 been constructed due to lack of financial resources.
 The Government permits prison visits by independent human rights monitors.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution and the Penal Code
 provide that no one may be deprived of liberty without a written order from a gov-
 ernmental authority, but the authorities often violated these legal protections. By
 law, the authorities must issue specific written arrest orders within 24 hours of de-
 tention-even in cases in which a suspect is caught committing a crime-and must
 charge the suspect with a specific criminal offense within 48 hours of arrest. All de-
 tained persons may challenge the legality of their detention within 48 hours of their
 arrest, but in practice few such petitions are brought. The senior elected official
 (usually the mayor) of the locality in which the suspect is held conducts this review.
 Regardless of the legality of a detention, a prisoner may be released only by court
 order. In some cases, detainees who are unaware of this, or who do not have the
 funds to hire a lawyer, may remain in prison for an extended period before being
 released. Bail is not generally available, and the law prohibits it in narcotics cases.
 
 
 Families of detainees sometimes intervene ,in an attempt to secure the prisoners'
 freedom through illegal means.
 Human rights organizations reported occasional cases of incommunicado deten-
 tion, although the law prohibits this practice. Even when the police obtain a written
 arrest order, those charged with determining the validity of detention often allowed
 frivolous charges to be brought, either because they were overworked or because the
 accuser bribed them. In many instances, the system was used as a means of harass-
 ment in civil cases in which one party sought to have the other arrested on criminal
 charges. Preventive detention up to and including trial is legal if a judge determines
 that it is necessary and if evidence that a crime has been committed is presented.
 Following the 1997 ruling by the Inter-American Court of Human Rights that the
 Government had violated due process provisions in connection with the arrest, in-
 vestigation, and pretrial detention of Ivan Suarez Rosero, the authorities released
 him. In the aftermath of the Suarez ruling, the Government moved quickly to settle
 several other cases that were under consideration by the Inter-American Commis-
 sion on Human Rights and one-the Benavides case-that had been accepted by the
 Inter-American Court. Led by the then-Attorney General (and current Ombudsman),
 the Government took the unprecedented step of admitting fault officially and of ne-
 gotiating and paying settlements to the families of Consuelo Benavides and the
 Restrepo brothers, for wrongful death, and to the Putumayo 11, a group of rural
 workers, for illegal arrest, detention, and torture (also see Section L.a.).
 The Government does not use exile as a method of political control.
 e. DenialofFair Public Trial.-The Constitution provides for an independentjudi-
 ciary. In practice, however, the judiciary is susceptible to outside pressure.
 The regular court system tries most nonmilitary defendants, although some indig-
 enous groups try members independently for Violations of tribal rules. Despite ef-
 forts begun in 1992 to depoliticize and modernize the court system, the judiciary
 continues to operate slowly and inconsistently. Judges reportedly rendered decisions
 more quickly or, more slowly depending on political pressure or the payment of
 bribes. However, the norm is for lengthy delays before cases come to the courts.
 The law permits police or military courts to try police officers and military defend-
 ants in closed sessions, in accordance with the respective military and police court
 martial manuals. Only the Supreme Court may try cases involving flag-rank offi-
 cers. The police court does not announce verdicts or punishments, reinforcing the
 strong impression that the police are immune from prosecution. The constitutional
 reforms by the National Constituent Assembly placed both police and military jus-
 tice under the control of the Supreme Court. .However, the three systems had not
 yet been integrated by year's end.
 The new Supreme Court that took office in 1997 publicly recognized the short-
 comings of the judicial system and pledged to improve the quality and training of
 judges. In May the Supreme Court supervised the selection by open competition of
 all appellate judges. A new judicial council, charged with administering the court
 system and disciplining judges, took office in the fall.
 The failure of the justice system led to a growing number of cases of communities
 taking the law into their own hands. There continued to be reports of lynchings and
 burnings of suspected criminals by enraged citizens (see Section L.a.). These oc-
 curred particularly in indigenous communities and poor neighborhoods of the major
 cities where there is little police presence. One egregious incident that, like many,
 was linked to purported cattle rustling, occurred in September in Manabi when a
 crowd of local farmers reportedly caught three men in the process of stealing cattle,
 shot and killed them, and then burned their bodies.
 The law provides for internationally accepted due process rights for criminal de-
 fendants, but the authorities often did not observe 'these rights in practice. By law,
 the accused is presumed innocent until proven guilty, and defendants have the right
 to a public trial, defense attorneys, and appeal. They may present evidence, refuse
 to testify against themselves, and may confront and cross-examine witnesses. Al-
 though a public defender system exists, in practice there are relatively few attorneys
 available to defend the large number of indigent suspects.
 Trial is supposed to beg  within 15 to 60 days of the initial arrest, but in prac-
 tice, initiation of the trial phase can take years. Less than 40 percent of all pris-
 oners have been convicted and sentenced. Accused narcotics traffickers cannot ob-
 tain bail or be released on recognizance. The number of narcotics cases is likely to
 decline, however, following passage of a law decriminalizing possession of small
 amounts of narcotics by addicts for their own use.
 A foreign assistance program begun in 1994 has enabled the courts to computerize
 the National Register of Prisoners. Use of this system made it possible for the courts
 to track prisoners' status more easily. Since its inception, the courts have been able
 to track prison populations more accurately. In 1998, the courts used this system
 
 
 to help identify and release hundreds of accused minor offenders who had spent
 more than a year in preventive detention.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f, Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The law
 prohibits such practices, government authorities generally respect these prohibi-
 tions, and violations are subject to effective legal sanctions.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech,
 and the authorities generally respected this provision in practice, but with some no-
 table exceptions. There are frequent charges of slander and libel brought by and
 against public figures, but few result in final decisions or judicial relief. In October
 a court tried former President Abdala Bucaram in absentia and convicted him of
 slandering Congresswoman Alexandra Vela.
 All of the major media organs-television, newspapers, and radio--are in local,
 private hands except for two government-owned radio stations. The law limits for-
 eign investment in broadcast media. Using a law promulgated by the last military
 regime that requires the media to give the Government free space or air time, the
 Government can and does require television and radio to broadcast government-pro-
 duced programs featuring the President and other top administration officials.
 There is a free and vigorous press. Ownership of the media is broadly based, and
 editorials represent a wide range of political views and often criticize the Govern-
 ment. However, some degree of self-censorship in the print media occurs, particu-
 larly with respect to politically sensitive issues or stories about the military and its
 related industries.
 The Government does not interfere in issues involving academic freedom.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 the right of free assembly for peaceful purposes, and the Government generally re-
 spected this right in practice. Pubic rallies require prior government permits, which
 are generally granted, although exceptions occur. Numerous labor and student dem-
 onstrations took place without incident in the capital and the outlying regions. In
 general the security forces intervened in demonstrations only when there was vio-
 lence against bystanders or property. In September protests in Quito against gov-
 ernment austerity measures were marred by violence, with several policemen in-
 jured and property damaged.
 The Constitution provides for freedom of association, and the Government gen-
 erally respected this right in practice.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the
 Government respects this right in practice. The Government allows missionary ac-
 tivity and religious demonstrations by all religions.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Constitution provides for these rights, and the Government re-
 speCt them in practice. The Government cooperates with the United Nations High
 Cmmissioner for Refugees and other humanitarian organizations in assisting refu-
 gees. The issue of provision of first asylum did not arise. There were no reports of
 the forced return of persons to a country where they feared persecution.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The Constitution provides citizens with the right to change their government
 peacefully, and citizens exercise this right in practice though periodic, free, and fair
 elections held on the basis of universal suffrage. Since the return to civilian rule
 in 1979, citizens have actively exercised their right to change their national and
 local governments. In May voters elected 121 members to a new Congress; in July
 President Jamil Mahuad defeated Alvaro Noboa in the second round of the presi-
 dential election in a close contest. Noboa disputed Mahuad's election, but an OAS-
 led observer mission noted that the election had been conducted transparently and
 that the official results accorded with the observers' private sample of election day
 ballots.
 Voting is mandatory for literate citizens over 18 years of age and voluntary for
 illiterate citizens. The law does not permit active duty members of the military to
 vote. The Constitution bars members of the clergy an a ctive duty miitary person-
 nel from election to Congress, the presidency, or vice presidency.
 The National Constituent Assembly to reform the Constitution concluded its work
 in June. The new Constitution took effect on August 10, with changes intended to
 strengthen the presidency, improve management of the Congress, and ensure in-
 creased protection for the rights of women, children, indigenous groups, and minori-
 ties.
 
 
 Traditional elites tend to be self-perpetuating. Consequently, few women, Afro-Ec-
 uadorians, and indigenous people are found -in high positions in government, al-
 though no specific laws prevent women or minorities from attaining leadership posi-
 tions. Women-hold 16 of 121 seats in Congress, the largest proportion of seats held
 by women in the country's history. One-Afro-Ecuadorian serves as a member of Con-
 gress. There are no other Afro-Ecuadorians serving in senior level government jobs.
 The indigenous movement, which previously shunned traditional politics, formed
 an electoral movement called Pachakutik (which means "cataclysmic change" in
 Quichua) and ran candidates for national, provincial, and local office in the 1996
 and 1998 elections. A Pachakutik Congresswoman, Nina Pacari, was elected Second
 Vice President of Congress. The first indigenous member to hold a top leadership
 rank, Pacari heads an eight-member congressional bloc whose cooperation with the
 majority in congress on some issues has ensured it significant influence. Indigenous
 members of the National Constituent Assembly, and their supporters, won impor-
 tant constitutional protections for indigenous rights, which took effect with the new
 Constitution in August.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 A number of human rights groups, both domestic and international, operate with-
 out restriction, investigating and publishing their findings on human rights cases.
 Domestic human rights groups, such as the CEDHU and the regional Latin Amer-
 ican Human Rights Association (ALDHU), were outspoken in their criticism of the
 Government's. record on specific cases. Nevertheless, the Government contracted
 with the ALDHU to provide human rights training to the military and the police.
 The Truth and Justice Commission, established-in 1996 to investigate reports of
 past rights abuse, is no longer active. The office of Ombudsman was created to en-
 sure ongoing attention to human rights issues. In September Congress elected a
 new Ombudsman who, as Attorney General under interim President Alarcon, had
 earned a reputation as a human rights advocate.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution prohibits discrimination based on race, religion, sex, or social
 status. In addition, the constitutional reforms explicitly increased the rights of
 women, children, and minorities, banned discrimination based on sexual preference,
 and required the new Congress to pass legislation implementing these rights
 promptly. However, women, Afro-Ecuadorians, and indigenous people face signifi-
 cant discrimination.
 Women.-Although the law prohibits violence against women, including within
 marriage, it is a widespread practice. Many rapes go unreported because of the vic-
 tims' reluctance to confront the perpetrators. Women may file complaints against a
 rapist or an abusive spouse or companion only if they produce a witness. In cases
 of statutory rape involving "amorous" sex with a minor, if the rapist marries the
 victim, the charges against him or anyone else who took part in the rape cannot
 be pursued unless the marriage is subsequently annulled. While some communities
 have established their own centers for counseling and legal support of abused
 women, the Government only began to address this question seriously with the for-
 mation of the "Comisaria de Ia Mujer," or Women's Bureau, in 1994. Although this
 office can accept complaints about abuse of women, it has no authority to act on
 them itself. However, the Women's Bureau doubled the number of its outreach of-
 fices and actively referred abuse cases to prosecutors.
 A 1995 Law Against Violence Affecting Women and Children, drafted by a coali-
 tion of women's -organizations, criminalizes spousal abuse for the first time, includ-
 ing physical, sexual, and psychological abuse. It also creates family courts and re-
 forms the Penal Code to give courts the power to separate an abusive spouse from
 the home.
 Discrimination against women is pervasive in society, particularly with respect to
 educational and economic opportunities for those in the lower economic strata. The
 increasingly active women's movement blames culture and tradition for inhibiting
 achievement of full equality for women. There are fewer women than men in the
 professions and skilled trades, and pay discrimination against women is common.
 Children.-The Government has not taken effective steps to promote the welfare
 of children. The Government rarely enforces the.constitutional requirement of edu-
 cation through the age of 14.
 There is no societal pattern of abuse against children. Government resources to
 assist children have traditionally been limited, although the Government instituted
 a program to care for the children of the working poor called "Operation Child Res-
 
 
 cue." The IACHR concluded that this program reached only a small percentage of
 those affected. Approximately 45 percent of children under the age of 5 are malnour-
 ished. Government spending on education continued to decline, both in real terms
 and as a proportion of gross domestic product.
 Several private organizations are very active in programs to assist street children,
 and the United Nations Children's Fund also runs a program in conjunction with
 the Central Bank. Especially in urban areas, the children of the poor often experi-
 ence severe hardships. It is common to see children as young as 5 or 6 years of age
 selling newspapers or candy on the street to support themselves or to augment the
 family income. Also, there are instances of prostitution by girls under 18 years of
 age in urban areas. In rural areas, young children often must leave school at an
 early age to help out on the family's plot of land.
 People With Disabilities.-There is no official discrimination against disabled per-
 sons in employment, education, or the provision of other state services. However,
 there are no laws to guarantee disabled people access to public buildings or services,
 nor are they provided any other special government assistance.
 Indigenous People.-While at least 85 percent of all citizens claim some indige-
 nous heritage, culturally indigenous people make up about 15 to 20 percent of the
 total population. The vast majority hive in rural areas, and most live mn varyingde-
 grees of poverty. Land is scarce in the more heavily populated highiand areas where
 high infant mortality, malnutrition, and epidemic disease are also common. In addi-
 tion, electricity and potable water are oftn unavailable. Although the rural edu-
 cation system is seriously deficient, many indigenous groups participated actively
 with the Ministry of Education in the development of the bilingual education pro-
 gram used in rural public schools.
 e new Constitution recognizes the rights of indigenous communities to hold
 property communally, to administer traditional community justice in certain cases,
 and to be consulted before natural resources were exploited in community terri-
 tories. Indigenous people continue to enjoy, in addition, the same civil and political
 rights as other citizens. In the Amazon area, indigenous groups have lobbied the
 Government, enlisted the help of foreign and domestic NGO's, and mounted protests
 (including kidnaping oil workers and tourists) in attempts to win a share of oil reve-
 nues and a voice in exploitation and development decisions. The new Constitution
 expressly recognizes the indigenous communities' rights to be consulted, but not to
 approve, oil exploration and development. Oil companies have increased their efforts
 to minimiz e  environmental and social impact of their oil projects in the Amazon
 but continue to face criticism from indigenous groups that environmental damage
 ensues.
 Despite their growing political influence (see Section 3) and the efforts of grass-
 roots community groups, which were increasingly successful in pressuring the cen-
 tral Government to assist them, Indians continue to suffer discrimination at many
 levels of society. With few exceptions, the indigenous people are at the lowest end
 of the socioeconomic scale.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-The population of the rural, northern coastal
 area includes large numbers of Afro-Ecuadorian citizens. They suffer widespread
 poverty and pervasive discrimination, particularly with regard to education t and
 economic opportunity. There were no special government efforts to address these
 problems.
 There are five major Afro-Ecuadorian organizations active in the country; they es-
 tmnate that Afro-Ecuadorias account for 700,000 people, or about 6 percent of the
 total population. While the presence of Afro-Ecuadorians has grown in the fields of
 sports and culture, educational opportunities continue to be limited.
 The press has focused on lingering racism among all strata of society. Afro-Ecun-
 dorian organizations note that despite the absence of official discrimination, societal
 discrimination continues to affect them. For example, they assert that the police
 stop Afro-Ecuadorians for document checks with greater frequency than other citi-
 zems.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution and Labor Code provide most
 workers with the right to form trade unions. Members of the police and the military,
 and public sector employees in nonrevenue producing entities are not free to form
 trade unions. The 1991 Labor Code reforms raised the number of workers required
 for an establishment to be unionized from 15 to 30, which the International Labor
 Organization's Committee on Freedom of Association considered too stringent a limi-
 tation at the plant workers' council level.
 While employees of state-owned organizations enjoy rights similar to those in the
 private sector, the law technically prevents the majority of public sector employees
 
 
 614
 
 from joining unions or exercising collective bargaining rights.- Nevertheless, most
 ublic employees maintain membership in some labor organization, and there are
 equent 'illegal" strikes. Despite official threats, the Government rarely takes ac-
 tion against striking public workers. The National Constituent Assembly defeated
 an attempt to overturn November 1997 legislation that outlawed public sector
 strikes that paralyze key services, including schools. Although the labor confed-
 erations are politically independent, the two largest single labor unions, the Teach-
 ers' Union and the Union of Social Security Workers, are allied with the Democratic
 Political. Movement, a far-left socialist party.
 Approximately 12 percent of, the work force is organized. There are four large
 labor centrals or confederations. None of the main labor centrals is firmly connected
 to any one political party, and there are no ties between the Government and any
 labor union.
 There are few restrictions on the right of workers to strike, although a 10-day
 cooling-off period is required before a strike is declared. The, Labor Code revisions
 limit solidarity strikes or boycotts to 3 days, provided that they are approved by the
 Labor Ministry. In a legal strike, workers may take possession of the factory or
 workplace, thus ending production at the site, and receive police protection during
 the takeover. The employer must pay all salaries and benefits during a legal strike;
 the Labor Code protects strikers and their leaders from retaliation. The only signifi-
 cant strikes were by public sector employees such as teachers, social security, and
 medical workers. None of the strikes resulted in violence.
 Unions may freely form and join federations or confederations, and three of the
 large labor centrals maintain international affiliations.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The labor market is highly
 segmented, with a minority of workers in skilled, usually unionized, positions in
 state-run enterprises or in medium to large industries. Most of the economically ac-
 tive population is employed in the agriculral sector or the urban informal sector;
 the vast majority of these workers are not organized. The Labor Code requires that
 all private employers with 30 or more workers belonging to a union must negotiate
 collectively when the union so requests. Although approximately 12 percent of the
 work force is organized, collective bargaining'agreements cover only one-quarter of
 these workers.
 The Labor Code streamlined the bargaining process in state enterprises by requir-
 ing workers to be represented by one labor union only. It prohibits discrimination
 against unions and requires that employers provide space for union activities upon
 the union's request. The law does not permit employers to dismiss a worker without
 the express permission of the Ministry of Labor, whose rulings are not subject to
 judicial review. If the Ministry of Labor rules that a dismissal is unjustified, it can
 require the employer to pay large indemnities or separation payments to the'work-
 er, although the reforms set a cap on such payments. The Labor Code provides for
 resolution of labor conflicts through an arbitration and conciliation board comprising
 one representative of the Ministry of Labor, two from the union, and two represent-
 atives of management.
 The Maquila (in bond) Law passed in 1990 permits the hiring of temporary work-
 ers for the maquila industries only. While there is no express prohibition on associa-
 tion rights in the Maquila Law, in practice it is difficult to organize temporary em-
 ployees on short-term contracts. Since temporary workers are not recognized by the
 Labor Code, they do not enjoy the same level of protection offered to other workers.
 The maquila system allows a company and its property to become an export process-
 ing zone wherever it is located. Many such "zones have thus been established; most
 are dedicated to textiles and fish processing.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Constitution and the Labor
 Code prohibit compulsory labor, and there were no reports of it in general, nor of
 forced or bonded labor by children.
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment.-The Con-
 stitution establishes that children must attend school until 14 years of age. How-
 ever, because of the lack of schools in many rural communities and the need for chil-
 dren to work, this provision is rarely enforced. The law prohibits persons younger
 than 14 years old from working, except in special circumstances such as apprentice-
 ships. It requires those between the ages of 14 and 18 years to have the permission
 of their parent or guardian to work. The law prohibits children between the ages
 of 15 and 18 years from working more than 7 hours per day or 35 hours per week,
 and .it restricts children below the age of 15 years to a maximum of 6 hours per
 day and 30 hours per week. In practice, the Ministry of Labor fails to enforce child
 labor laws. In rural areas many children attend school only sporadically after about
 10 years of age in order to contribute to household income as farm laborers. In the
 city many children under 14 years of age work in family-owned "businesses" in the
 
 
 informal sector, shining shoes, collecting and recycling garbage, or as street ped-
 dlers. The law prohibits forced or bonded labor by children, and there were no re-
 ports of such practices (see Section 6.c.).
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The Ministry of Labor sets the minimum wage
 every 6 months in consultation with the Commission on Salaries, but Congress may
 also adjust it. The statutory minimum wage is not adequate to provide a decent
 standard of living for a worker and family. As of September, the minimum wage
 lus mandated bonuses provided a gross monthly compensation of approximately
 134 (S/803,333). Most organized workers in state industries and formal sector pri-
 vate enterprises earned substantially more than the minimum wage and also re-
 ceived significant other benefits through collective bargaining agreements. The ma-
 jority of workers, however, work in the large informal and rural sector without re-
 course to the minimum wage or legally mandated benefits.
 The Ministry of Labor has the principal role in enforcing labor laws and carries
 this out through a corps of labor inspectors who are active in all 21 provinces. The
 Labor Code provides for a 40-hour workweek, a 15-day annual vacation, a minimum
 wage, and other employer-provided benefits, such as uniforms and training opportu-
 nities.
 The Labor Code also provides general protection for workers' health and safety
 on the job. A worker may not leave the workplace of his own volition, even if there
 is a hazardous situation. The worker is allowed to request that an inspector from
 the Ministry of Labor come to the workplace and confirm the hazard; that inspector
 may then close down the workplace.
 The Government enforces health and safety standards and regulations through
 the Social Security Institute. In the formal sector, occupational health and safety
 is not a major problem. However, there are no specific regulations governing health
 and safety standards in the agricultural sector and, in practice, there is no enforce-
 ment of safety rules in the small mines that make up the vast majority of the min-
 ing sector.
