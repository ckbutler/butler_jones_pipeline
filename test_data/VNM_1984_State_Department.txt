 VIETNAM
 The Socialist Republic of Vietnam is a dictatorship ruled by
 the Vietnamese Communist Party, the sole arbiter of power.
 The Communist Party took power in the North, as the Vietnamese
 Workers Party, after a long war of independence from France,
 culminating in the Geneva Conference of 1954 which partitioned
 the country. The current elderly leadership is essentially
 the group which prosecuted the anti-colonial struggle and
 subsequently launched the armed effort to gain control of the
 southern Republic of Vietnam in the early 1960's. This ended
 with the invasion of the South in 1975 and formal unification
 of the country the next year, in spite of the southern
 Communists' pretensions to independence.
 Vietnam's determination to dominate the other former French
 Indo-Chinese colonies of Laos and Cambodia was a factor
 leading to the invasion of Cambodia in December 1978. The
 Vietnamese deposed the oppressive Khmer Rouge regime, but the
 invasion led to continued major violations of the Khmer
 people's human rights as a result of Vietnamese occupation and
 their installation of a puppet government. The resulting lack
 of Khmer self-determination is a major long-term human rights
 issue in Cambodia. Violations of human rights by the
 so-called People's Republic of Kampuchea have included
 executions, forced labor, denial of legal process, forced
 relocations, and arbitrary arrest. Vietnam continues to
 control virtually all the policies and actions of the regime
 in Phnom Penh, and thus must bear heavy responsibility for
 these violations.
 Vietnam's invasion and continuing occupation of Cambodia
 diverted resources from reconstruction in Vietnam. At the
 same time, Vietnam's dispute with China, resulting partly from
 its Cambodian adventure, forces Vietnam to maintain a large
 army on its northern border. It also maintains significant
 forces in Laos in order to keep the Lao Government, which it
 dominates, in power. These policies have left Vietnam with
 the third largest army in the world and one of the lowest per
 capita national incomes.
 Its siege mentality, impulse to "manifest destiny," and
 Communist ideology have led to a heavy emphasis in Vietnamese
 life on the military and internal security apparatus. The
 military is over one million strong, while the public security
 organization is pervasive in its surveillance and control of
 the citizenry.
 Vietnam is a poor, underdeveloped, agricultural country faced
 with the problem of feeding a large population (59 million),
 with many of its most talented people having fled overseas.
 At the same time, it is attempting to impose a Soviet-style,
 Marxist-Leninist political and economic system on a populace
 in the South with a different value system and of questionable
 loyalty to the current regime. Vietnam's industrial plant is
 small and its debt burden high. The general standard of
 living for most citizens is barely above subsistence level,
 although Vietnam has claimed that it is now able to meet
 minimum food requirements. Food is rationed or high-priced on
 the free market. Hanoi has formally denied "civil rights' as
 well as working papers and ration coupons to many of its
 citizens deemed politically unacceptable; many *reeducation
 camp" returnees and others without official jobs are forced to
 live precariously in an underground economy, as the only other
 option left to them is moving to undesirable *new economic
 
 
 892
 VIETNAM
 zones." Many in the South depend for their survival on aid
 from relatives abroad.
 The Vietnamese citizen today is subject to arrest either for
 past association with the former government in the South or
 for espousing political ideas contrary to those of the
 regime. He has the obligation to vote, but all candidates are
 selected by the party. Despite legally guaranteed freedom of
 religion, many religious leaders have been imprisoned on
 political charges. The press is completely controlled by the
 regime.
 There was little change in the human rights situation in
 Vietnam during 1984, with no amelioration of economic, social
 or political conditions. An increasing number of people did
 leave Vietnam legally and safely via the Orderly Departure
 Program and there was a related decrease in people risking
 their lives to leave Vietnam by boat or overland. On the
 negative side, the Government has continued the trend noticed
 in 1983 of closely watching, and repressing, religious groups
 and others suspected of anti-government activities and recent
 trials suggest an increasingly stringent public security
 posture.
 The forecast for human rights in Vietnam remains bleak, as the
 regime has evinced no perception of the concept of individual
 rights. Improvement in the economy is likely to be slow and
 is unlikely to be accompanied by liberalization in human
 rights, given Vietnam's commitment to create a
 Marxist-Leninist state. Ongoing discussions between the
 United States and Vietnam over the possible release of those
 in Vietnamese *reeducation camps,' and their subsequent
 emigration for resettlement in the United States offer one
 potentially positive development, if the Vietnamese are
 prepared to negotiate seriously and an agreement can be
 reached. These camps have been a serious blot on Vietnam's
 human rights record.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 The Vietnamese Government acknowledges that some individuals
 whom it considered 'war criminals' were executed in the wake
 of the 1975 takeover. There are reports that many more
 persons were detained in rural areas in mid-1975 and never
 heard from again. Former inmates of *reeducation camps' have
 reported summary executions for escape attempts and resistance
 to camp authorities. Attacks by minority and ethnic
 Vietnamese resistance groups, which still exist, against
 Vietnamese government authority usually target army units, but
 they sometimes attack public security or government
 administrative officials. Although accurate figures are not
 available, the number of deaths caused by these activities
 appears to be small.
 b. Disappearance
 Refugees arriving in Thailand in 1984 have reported incidents
 in which people dressed in civilian clothing have abducted
 people from their houses in the night. The fate of those who
 disappeared was unknown. However, the refugees believed that
 
 
 893
 VIETNAM
 if those abducted had been sent to prison or "reeducation
 camps," they would subsequently have been heard from. The
 refugees report that police ascribed these activities to
 criminal elements, but the refugees believe that the
 abductions were committed by public security organizations.
 Although figures are unavailable, one refugee who left Vietnam
 in August 1984 reported that three such instances occurred in
 the district in Ho Chi Minh City (Saigon) in which he lived
 during 1984. There have been no reports of disappearances or
 hostage-taking by forces resisting the Vietnamese authorities.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Reports from refugees are consistent concerning the severity
 of the conditions for prisoners in the 'reeducation camps.*
 In these camps, provision of food rations below subsistence
 levels, denial of medical care, and assignment of hard labor
 to political prisoners and prisoners of conscience have been
 regularly practiced. Prisoners are punished severely, for
 example, by several months' solitary confinement for minor
 infractions of camp rules. These practices can result in
 acute suffering, permanent physical impairment and death. The
 prisoners have indeterminate sentences and face the prospect
 of indefinite penal labor. In addition to common criminals,
 these camps contain former officials and military officers of
 the Republic of Vietnam, many of them aged, and people
 arrested for political reasons since the Communist takeover in
 1975. Included are chaplains and clergy from both Buddhist
 and Christian groups, intellectuals and former political
 leaders. It has been reported by people imprisoned for
 attempting to flee from Vietnam that beatings during
 interrogation have resulted in death. Reportedly, no medical
 care is available. A former inmate in a prison for people who
 have attempted to leave Vietnam illegally has reported that
 prisoners who resist guards' orders have been executed.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Suspects may be apprehended on a warrant, which may stipulate
 the nature of the crime and permit detention for two months
 prior to trial. An extension for a further two-months
 detention can be obtained upon application to higher
 authorities. There is no provision for bail, nor access to a
 defense lawyer prior to trial.
 However, for major crimes or those of a political nature
 public security officials may apprehend and search suspects
 without a warrant. Such suspects may be held an indefinite
 period without any judicial process. For example, Hanoi
 recently reported the 1983 trial of one "spy" who had been
 held since mid-1978. Refugees report that the authorities
 sometimes wait several months before notifying relatives of
 arrests.
 Those suspected of political crimes may be sent to
 *reeducation camps' without trial or charge. The Government
 continues to hold large numbers of people in the camps,
 including both those whom the Government distrusts because of
 their association with the former Republic of Vietnam, and
 those whose current political views are suspect. These camps
 remove dissident elements from society, particularly competent
 and/or charismatic leaders. The camps attempt to produce
 conformity through confinement, hard labor, self-criticism and
 
 
 894
 VIETNAM
 a minimum amount of indoctrination. While several thousand
 prisoners have been released, including officers up to the
 rank of colonel (and a handful of generals, mostly from the
 medical services), some have been rearrested. Decisions on
 most releases appear arbitrary and often the result of bribery.
 The Vietnamese Government officially maintains that the number
 of people associated with the former regime detained in the
 camps since 1975 is on the order of 10,000. Others
 incarcerated in the system include post-1975 dissidents, those
 caught trying to emigrate illegally, and common criminals.
 Forced labor has been used by Vietnamese and local authorities
 in Cambodia for projects to improve the logistical
 infrastructure for Vietnamese occupation troops. This labor
 cannot be justified as a normal civic obligation or an
 emergency response to catastrophe.
 e. Denial of Pair Public Trial
 Arbitrary detention without charge, trial or any form of legal
 proceedings under the guise of 'reeducation' has subverted the
 rudimentary legal system which exists. Even for those who are
 given a trial, for the most part those charged with
 non-political crimes or specific prohibited political acts,
 the judicial process cannot be considered fair to the
 accused. A case brought to trial almost invariably leads to
 conviction.
 Initially, a 'people's committee,* an administrative body,
 holds a preliminary hearing. Upon its recommendation, the
 case is brought before a local or high people's court,
 depending upon the severity of the sentence to which the
 accused is liable. The high court tries those accused of
 serious criminal or political crimes for which the sentence is
 greater than two, or in some locales five, years imprisonment
 or death. The court consists of a presiding judge, two or
 three people's judges, a prosecutor and a court-appointed
 defense counsel. The defense counsel ensures that the proper
 legal procedures are followed in accordance with the
 defendant's rights under the Constitution and explains the
 proceedings to the defendant. However, the defense counsel is
 not an advocate for the defendant in the Western sense. The
 trial is normally a formality at which the judges present
 their ruling on evidence which they have studied prior to the
 trial. Following the verdict of the judges, the defendant has
 15 days to appeal the verdict to the National Assembly if the
 case has been tried by the high people's court. There is no
 appeal from local courts.
 In general, the entire legal system operates as an agency for
 the enforcement of regime directives; it has no independence
 from political intervention.
 In addition to those detained without trial in 'reeducation
 camps", there are also a number of people who have been
 charged, tried and executed for conspiring to overthrow the
 government or for other political crimes. In December, 1984,
 21 persons were put on trial for espionage. The appointed
 Vietnamese defense attorney at the trial was quoted during the
 proceedings as saying, "They violated the law and nobody can
 defend them because they are traitors." Several of those
 accused were found guilty and sentenced to death and nearly
 100 more suspects are reported to be under arrest. There is
 
 
 895
 VIETNAM
 no reliable estimate of the overall number of such political
 offenders in Vietnam. Vietnamese sources have told Western
 reporters that more trials are planned in 1985.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The system of population surveillance by party-appointed block
 wardens, who use informants to keep track of each individual's
 political and economic activities, has been extended from
 northern Vietnam to Ho Chi Minh City and other southern cities
 and rural areas. Recent reports indicate that the system now
 pervades rural hamlets. However, the system works imperfectly
 in the South, partly because of a shortage of trusted party
 workers. There have been reports of officials planting
 incriminating evidence during searches of residences. There
 have also been reports of officials and even unofficial
 security wardens conducting midnight searches of homes for
 draft-age males in order to fulfill draft quotas. No warrants
 were required. There continue to be reliable reports that the
 Ministry of the Interior inspects and sometimes confiscates
 international mail sent to Vietnam, particularly to
 politically suspect individuals or those of Chinese origin.
 Outgoing mail is also subject to inspection and censorship.
 The regime has spoken openly of its program to relocate
 millions of people to *new economic zones' in virgin or
 unproductive rural areas in order to expand agricultural
 production and reduce *unproductive" urban populations.
 Hundreds of thousands were resettled in these remote zones in
 the years following the fall of South Vietnam. The
 resettlement process has involved forms of coercion in most
 cases. The program frequently targeted for resettlement those
 whose views and background made them politically suspect and
 often unable to find employment. Conditions in these zones
 are widely reported to range from poor to life-threatening
 with inadequate provision of basic services. Many of the
 relocated people have left the zones, returning to the cities
 where they are forced to live, on an already marginal economy,
 without the ration or neighborhood registration cards
 essential to procuring employment, food, and other essential
 services. Without these documents they can be arrested
 arbitrarily and returned to the *new economic zone.'
 The relocation program continues now, drawing mainly from the
 overpopulated rural areas of the North and central coastal
 plains. A January 6, 1984 article in the party daily Nhan Dan
 reported the Government's goal of relocating 50 percent more
 laborers in 1984 than the 95,000 relocated in 1983. An
 October 7, 1984 report on Hanoi domestic radio said that an
 additional 50,000 laborers, for a total of 180,000, would be
 relocated in 1984, thus enabling the state to complete labor
 redistribution for the five-year 1981-85 plan in only four
 years. The 1981-85 plan calls for the relocation of one
 million people. The Government has made more effort to
 prepare for the new settlers, but conditions remain rigorous.
 The official rationale for the massive dislocation of the
 people is increased economic production, particularly of cash
 crops such as coffee and rubber. Although the Government
 offers inducements and speaks of 'volunteers' when discussing
 people resettled in these zones, it is clear that this
 resettlement arbitrarily interferes with the individual's
 right to live in a place of his own choosing. The
 
 
 896
 VIETNAM
 resettlement often displaces tribal minorities, threatening
 their traditional customs and subsistence.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The right of freedom of speech and the press does not exist in
 Vietnam. The Ministry of Culture and Information and organs
 of the party control all newspapers, books, and other
 publications, as well as all cultural exhibitions. The
 Government controls and censors all public sources of
 information and promotes "revolutionary culture* in the arts.
 Many prominent artists and writers have been arrested. The
 import of books and periodicals is virtually prohibited, and
 although Western broadcasts are not jammed, citizens are
 subject to questioning if they are caught listening.
 Independent criticism of the party and Government is not
 permitted. Self-censorship by journalists operates without
 question, given the pervasive control of the party.
 The blogk surveillance system uses informants to monitor the
 activities of citizens. Public criticism of officials is not
 permitted, except in official news media when criticizing the
 laxity and/or corruption of some officials or groups of
 officials who do not meet party norms.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Individuals are prohibited from meeting either publicly or
 privately to criticize or protest government actions or
 policies. Non-governmental organizations, such as church
 groups, can meet for narrowly defined objectives, such as
 church services, but not for other purposes.
 In lieu of independent labor unions, government-controlled
 unions have been set up under the Vietnam Federation of Trade
 Unions, one of the organizations controlled by the Communist
 Party. Claiming three million members, the Federation's
 stated goal is to increase party control and production,
 rather than to improve the welfare of the worker or to protect
 their rights. Other *mass organizations,' such as women's
 federations, exist in other sectors of the population. They
 perform the same functions of control, propaganda, and policy
 dissemination within their respective sectors as do the labor
 organizations among workers. These organizations have links
 with parallel Soviet and East European organizations.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 The Government tolerates the existence of religious groups and
 allows religious services, but has consistently attempted to
 divide, control and reduce the Catholic, Buddhist, and Cao Dai
 churches, the Muslim community, and other religious groups.
 The Government perceives religious groups as potential hotbeds
 of subversion and political opposition. It has attempted to
 prevent their growth and inhibit proselytizing activities by
 prohibiting publication of religious materials by curtailing
 religious education, and by forbidding any gathering except
 for weekly services. The Government has attempted to coopt
 religious groups by promoting its own organizations with a
 view to supplanting those not totally under its control.
 
 
 897
 VIETNAM
 In 1984 the Government continued to apply pressure on the
 Catholic Church, partially as a way to intimidate Catholics.
 There were several reports of the arrest of Catholic
 clergymen, particularly in the Hue area. There are reportedly
 over 100 priests detained in "reeducation camps." Most former
 South Vietnamese military chaplains of all religions have
 remained in prison since 1975. Catholic priests and nuns are
 subject to police surveillance, and most are required by the
 authorities to work full-time in secular occupations, thus
 limiting their participation in religious activities. A
 former seminarian has reported that no priest has been
 ordained since 1980. Harassment of the clergy and their
 congregations occurs in other ways as well. For example,
 Catholics are required to register as such with the
 authorities, although Buddhists are not. Catholics are
 discriminated against in employment. "Voluntary" work and
 other required activities are scheduled by the authorities
 during times of regular church services. As a result of
 harassment, the size of Catholic congregations has shrunk
 steadily since 1975. One refugee reported that congregations
 in Ho Chi Minh City in 1984 were half the size of a year ago.
 Yet, the Church appears to have more successfully survived in
 the southern cities than in the countryside. The teaching
 role of the Catholic Church has been severely restricted, and
 many churches and all but one Catholic seminary in the South
 have been closed. Sermons require government approval and
 uncooperative priests are subject to confinement in remote
 villages or incarceration in "reeducation camps".   In central
 Vietnam, thousands of Catholics have been forcibly relocated
 and forced to work on government construction projects. The
 Government has sharply curtailed the ordination of new
 Catholic priests and restricted communication between rural
 parishes and their bishops.
 The Protestant churches have been similarly restricted. Those
 active in the highlands have all been closed, as was the sole
 Protestant college and theological seminary. There have been
 continued reports of harassment among those evangelical
 churches which have been allowed--albeit within narrow
 limits--to continue to hold services in urban areas.
 Parishioners may not attend services in other churches of
 their own sect but are restricted to their own parish.
 Authorities have reportedly forbidden at least one such group
 from meeting at all.
 Most of the 30,000 Vietnamese Muslims are members of the Cham
 minority, which the regime mistrusts and harasses. The
 alliance of Cham with Khmer Krom (Cambodian residents of
 Vietnam) and hilltribes (Montagnards) created the only sizable
 resistance movement in Vietnam, The United Liberation Front of
 the Oppressed Races. In its repression of the Cham the
 Government has eliminated the position of mufti, or religious
 leader, within the Islamic communities, disbanded the
 organized Muslim association, and severed links with overseas
 Islamic organizations. The regime forbids the pilgrimage to
 Mecca and has not given permission for the Muslim community to
 participate in the Koran reading contest held annually in
 Malaysia. Many Muslim schools have been closed but most
 mosques remain open. Importation of the Koran is forbidden
 and the Koran printing house has been closed.
 About 30 million people of Vietnam's population of 59 million
 are Buddhists, the great majority of them Mahayana.
 Vietnamese authorities have tried repeatedly since 1975 to
 
 
 898
 VIETNAM
 suppress and intimidate the Mahayana Buddhist leadership. The
 authorities have closed temples and transformed them into
 public buildings. They have arrested monks intermittently
 since 1975 and hundreds remain in "reeducation camps."
 Several monks were reportedly arrested in 1984. Many monks
 remain under house arrest, and the travel of those not under
 detention is severely restricted. Government permission is
 required for monks to travel and stay overnight away from
 their home temples. Some reports allege that local
 authorities seek to control and restrict the community of
 Buddhist monks by forbidding the donation of food. The
 majority of pre-1975 monks in the South have been forced to
 leave the monkhood and few young men are allowed to join the
 community. Teaching of seminarians must often be conducted in
 secret and pagoda schools have been closed. Monks of the
 formerly politically active An Quang, Xa Loi, and Vinh Nghiem
 pagodas are kept under close government surveillance and are
 rarely allowed visitors.
 The regime organized a conference in November 1981 to
 establish the Unified Vietnam Buddhist Church. Its charter
 provides that it is "the only Buddhist organization
 representing Vietnamese Buddhism in all other relations in the
 country and with other countries." Reports suggest that the
 new church has no appeal to most Buddhists who view it simply
 as a creature of the regime.
 Most of Vietnam's Therevada Buddhists are Khmer Krom. This
 group numbers about 800,000 people living in southern and
 southwestern Vietnam, and has provided the Vietnamese army of
 occupation in Cambodia with interpreters and staff for its
 government in Cambodia. Nevertheless, the Khmer Krom continue
 to be distrusted by the Vietnamese, partly for historical
 reasons. A number of former Therevada leaders have been
 imprisoned.
 Other religious groups have also been persecuted by the
 regime. The Hoa Hao (an anti-Communist Buddhist sect)
 strongly resisted the Communist takeover in 1975. As a
 result, the Government violently repressed the sect and
 arrested virtually all of its leaders. The regime maintains
 tight control over Hoa Hao areas. Similarly, the regime has
 arrested many of, the leaders of the Cao Dai (a uniquely
 Vietnamese religion based on elements of Buddhism, Islam and
 Christianity). Refugees have reported police occupation of
 the Cao Dai Holy See in Tay Ninh City. The official press has
 claimed that the Cao Dai leaders have used the Holy See to
 establish an anti-government subversive organization,
 broadcasting and printing anti-government messages and storing
 arms for an uprising. Some leaders have been tried and
 executed for these alleged activities, according to the
 official news media. A trial of two leaders and 31
 accomplices was publicized in August 1983.
 Since the regime views religion as a possible source of
 political opposition, adherence to a religious sect is
 incompatible with membership in the Communist Party. Party
 membership is a prerequisite for advancement in society.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation. ,
 Government approval is required for all external travel, and
 one must have an identity card to travel internally. No one
 
 
 899
 VIETNAM
 is allowed to change residence or work location without
 permission from the authorities. Since public security cadre
 periodically check household occupants against the official
 family register, unauthorized absences also subject families
 to surveillance and harassment. With few exceptions, only
 government officials or approved spokesmen for
 quasi-governmental organizations receive permission to travel
 abroad.
 A number of factors, in addition to the generally repressive
 political situation, have caused a mass exodus from Vietnam
 since 1975. Among them are ethnic and religious persecution,
 discrimination with regard to economic and educational
 opportunities, fear of imprisonment or of forced resettlement
 in remote areas, and fear of conscription to fight in Cambodia.
 In early 1978, the Vietnamese adopted a program to
 'facilitate" the flight from Vietnam of ethnic Chinese and
 others by boat. The program was administered through special
 offices at the provincial level which charged large fees for
 exit permits and passage. At its height in the spring of
 1979, the exodus, mostly of ethnic Chinese, reached over
 40,000 a month by boat, with the "boat.people* exposed to
 extreme hardship at sea, in many cases resulting in death.
 At the International Conference on Vietnamese Refugees held in
 Geneva in July 1979, the Vietnamese Government announced a
 moratorium on these refugee departures, and information from
 refugees who have left Vietnam since then indicates that the
 Government is now actively interdicting such boat departures
 (though many officials still assist those attempting to flee
 if sufficiently bribed). During the past several years, there
 have been reliable reports of Vietnamese patrol boats firing
 upon and sinking helpless refugee boats attempting to flee
 clandestinely. Hundreds of these refugees have either died,
 or been captured and imprisoned as a result of these attacks.
 In May 1979, the United Nations High Commission for Refugees
 (UNHCR) reached agreement with Vietnam on the legal departure
 of people from Vietnam under an 'Orderly Departure Program."
 The program started slowly with only slightly more than 13,000
 leaving Vietnam in the 27 months between July 1979 and October
 1981. The Vietnamese then expanded the program, and over
 12,000 left in the next year. During fiscal year 1983 the
 number of people leaving Vietnam under the program increased
 to 15,631, and in fiscal year 1984 the number of people
 leaving Vietnam under the UNHCR program was 28,340.
 A significant number of people leaving in the Orderly
 Departure Program are ethnic Chinese who consistently find it
 easier than ethnic Vietnamese to be approved officially for
 departure. Another significant portion is composed of
 'Amerasians," children fathered by Americans in Vietnam, who
 have suffered racial discrimination.
 During 1984, refugees continued to leave Vietnam
 clandestinely, although at a lower rate than past years.
 Hanoi and provincial radio stations have broadcast reports of
 executions or of lengthy jail sentences for organizers of
 failed escape attempts, as well as punishments dealt to others
 implicated. Currently, male offenders can expect sentences
 ranging from three to fifteen years at hard labor--depending
 on their role in the departure attempt--while women receive
 one to three months, with childless women often receiving
 
 
 900
 VIETNAM
 longer sentences. Those released from 'reeducation camp* who
 attempt flight can expect to be returned to the camps for an
 indefinite term. Property, often including the means of
 livelihood, is confiscated from those caught trying to escape,
 as is the property left behind by those who succeed.
 Individuals reportedly must often bribe officials to be placed
 on Orderly Departure Program lists. Refugees from the Mekong
 Delta have reported that some people have paid officials from
 4,800 to 6,000 dollars in gold per person to be placed on
 tentative lists with no guarantee as to when or if they would
 be permitted to leave. People who have applied for exit
 permits reportedly are subject to recurring security checks
 and harassment.
 Pew have returned to Vietnam after having fled the country.
 Those who fled in the immediate aftermath of the fall of South
 Vietnam in 1975 and later returned were incarcerated in
 'reeducation camps.' In only a few isolated cases has Hanoi
 allowed anyone to return in recent years; in effect, those who
 emigrate lose their citizenship. Some who left Vietnam and
 have acquired nationalities and travel documents of other
 countries have, however, been permitted to return to Vietnam
 as visitors. The Government apparently wishes to encourage
 their links to their remaining relatives and thus the flow of
 hard currency into the country.
 Since the occupation of Cambodia by Vietnam, large numbers of
 Vietnamese, possibly as many as several hundred thousand, have
 settled there. Although many of these people are former
 residents of Cambodia expelled by its former rulers, a
 significant number are reportedly first-time settlers.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 All authority and political power is vested in the Communist
 Party, and political opposition'or advocacy of change in this
 system is not tolerated. The Politburo of the Central
 Committee of the Communist Party of Vietnam is the supreme
 decision-making body in the nation, while the party's
 Secretariat oversees day-to-day implementation of politburo
 directives. The party leadership selects candidates for the
 Central Committee. The periodic National Party Congresses
 merely ratify the selection without any choice among the
 candidates. The Congress is made up of delegates from the
 party apparatus of each province, who are similarly selected
 by higher levels.
 Ostensibly the chief legislative body, the National Assembly,
 in fact approves without dissent the policies set by the
 Communist Party Politburo. National Assembly elections are
 held in Vietnam every five years, most recently in 1981.
 Local elections are held more often. The electorate must
 participate in these elections in order to have ration cards
 validated. Voters do not have a real political choice. They
 may only strike out the names of candidates for whom they do
 not wish to vote from the single list which is presented to
 them.
 Although southerners have been appointed to some ministerial
 and National Assembly positions, the leadership's distrust of
 southerners, including some long-time Communist cadre or party
 members, is a significant factor in the assignment of
 
 
</pre>
<pre>
 901
 VIETNAM
 political responsibilities. Southerners who played roles in
 the Provisional Revolutionary Government prior to 1975 have
 since, for the most part, been shunted aside by the northern
 leadership.
 Gradual assimilation and cooption appear to be the
 Government's long-run strategy in regard to most minorities.
 The Government has created special schools in the Hanoi area
 to train minority cadres who can be the *eyes and ears" of the
 party among their own people. Highland minorities in central
 Vietnam are subject to repression if suspected of ties with
 resistance groups. Officially programed settlement of ethnic
 Vietnamese into the highlands is designed to enhance lowlander
 control and to restrict minorities, some of which are being
 forced into settled agriculture. Southern minorities such as
 the Chinese, Indian, and Khmer have been encouraged to leave
 the country.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Vietnam is not a member of any international human rights
 organizations, nor is it active in attempting to ameliorate
 the human rights situation in other countries. In April 1983
 Amnesty International issued an appeal to the Government of
 Vietnam to release or bring to trial the thousands of people
 held without trial, many since 1975. Both this appeal and
 previous Amnesty International reports as well as the 1984
 Report expressed concern over the violation of human rights by
 the detention of people without trial in 'reeducation camps'
 under harsh conditions over a period of years. Freedom House,
 in its 1984-85 report lists Vietnam as "not free.*
 The few foreign delegations and journalists who have been
 allowed to visit 'reeducation camps' have been shown model
 prisons. Former prisoners have described extensive
 preparations to beautify their camps prior to such visits,
 temporary removal of most prisoners during the visit, and
 careful briefing of the remaining prisoners by Communist Party
 cadre on what to tell delegation members.
 The Government does not permit the existence in Vietnam of
 private groups concerned with human rights.
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 Almost ten years after the reunification of the country,
 Vietnam's economy continues its stagnation. Although
 industrial output began to increase in 1981 after several
 years of decline or almost zero growth, the industrial sector
 remains extremely weak. Increased emphasis on light industry
 has led to some increase in consumer goods. However, wage
 increases for officials have not kept pace with inflation, and
 for those without access to subsidized goods, economic
 conditions have deteriorated. This economic stagnation is due
 in large part to the diversion of resources, particularly
 trained managers, and to the maintenance of a large standing
 army, both in Cambodia and on the Chinese frontier. A second
 major factor is Vietnam's inability to service its external
 debt, thereby precluding foreign investment and multilateral
 developmental assistance. Most countries capable of providing
 bilateral assistance are unwilling to do so in the face of
 Vietnam's occupation of Cambodia. The flight of technically
 
 
 902
 VIETNAM
 skilled people abroad and underuse of Western-trained
 technicians has also handicapped development. Production
 incentives have ameliorated agricultural shortages to a
 degree. According to Hanoi, grain production reached 17
 million metric tons in 1984, 200-300,000 metric tons greater
 than the previous year, but below the 18 million metric ton
 target. The announced per capita production in 1984 was 290
 kilograms, down from 300 in 1983, which Hanoi's planning chief
 then termed *borderline between causing malnutrition and being
 barely enough.' Given inadequate distribution, severe local
 shortages probably occurred in northern-areas hit by natural
 calamities during 1984.
 Rampant inflation for several years has forced many city
 dwellers, especially government cadre and workers, to hold two
 jobs, and has led to increased corruption and crime. Refugees
 have reported inflation in necessities of at least 50 percent
 in 1984. Corruption is now seen aq a fact of life throughout
 the South and is becoming pervasive in the North. Government
 measures to restrict the amount of goods and money which
 families can receive from abroad as well as other official
 moves against free market activities have to a degree
 curtailed free trading.
 Collectivization of the fishing industry and nationalization
 of most ocean-going vessels have lowered fishermen's income
 severely. The fishing industry has been further curtailed by
 strict government limits on the amount of fuel and water
 permitted aboard. These measures have been adopted to prevent
 refugee escapes. Depletion of the fishing fleet through loss
 of boats to transport refugees has also hurt the industry.
 Primary education is claimed by the authorities to be
 universal (98.1 percent in 1980 according to the World Bank),
 but some children, such as the Amerasians, are reportedly not
 allowed to attend school. Education above the elementary
 level, particularly at higher levels, is often restricted to
 those with approved backgrounds. The party committee in each
 school reportedly makes the final determination as to who will
 graduate. Similarly, study abroad is restricted to those who
 are politically acceptable.
 The ethnic Chinese are severely discriminated against through
 denial of officially sanctioned employment and educational
 opportunities. Former military officers of the Republic of
 Vietnam are systematically denied employment, and the children
 of former military and civilian officials of the Saigon
 government are denied university education by a review of
 family background which culls out 'undesirable elements.'
 Those released from "reeducation camps' are formally denied
 their civil rights for an indefinite period and are subject to
 severe restrictions in employment and travel.
 Despite the promises of the Communist Party to emancipate
 women, there are no women in the Party Politburo and only four
 women in the 116-member Central Committee, although 108 (22
 percent) of the rubber stamp National Assembly members are
 women. There is only one woman government minister (for
 education) out of 35 members of the Council of Ministers.
 Despite having proved themselves in important administrative
 and production roles during the war, Vietnamese women have
 retreated from the management positions they held at that time
 and returned to the home to raise families. This trend is
 partly due to the proclivities of those involved, but it is
 
 
 903
 VIETNAM
 also a result of the lingering Confucian attitudes of
 Vietnamese men. At the primary level, women attend school at
 almost the same rate as men (89 percent versus 94 percent).
 Reliable figures are unavailable for higher education
 attendance ratios.
 The level of health care has declined since 1975. Severe
 shortages of medical facilities and medicines have been
 aggravated by the need to divert material and people for the
 care of soldiers wounded in Cambodia. Only the most minimal.
 facilities are available to the average worker. Ordinary
 peasants and workers must purchase medical prescriptions on
 the open market, unlike party cadre who have access to free or
 government-subsidized prescriptions. Those who are not
 employed by the state are not eligible for care at government
 medical facilities. Medicine is in extremely short supply and
 thus expensive on the free market. The general health
 condition of those in the Orderly Departure Program has
 deteriorated noticeably and steadily over the years.
 Around 75,000 Vietnamese workers have been sent under contract
 to work in various occupations in the Soviet Union and East
 European countries. A significant portion of their wages is
 deducted to help pay for Vietnam's debt to these countries.
 It appears, however, that most of these workers enter this
 work program voluntarily in order to escape the extreme
 poverty and unemployment of present day Vietnam.
