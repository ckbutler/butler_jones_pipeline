 CROATIA
 The Republic of Croatia, whose territory formerly constituted one of the constitu-
 ent republics of the former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, declared its
 indevendence on June 25. 1991. and sought international recognition. That action
 
 
 741
 precipitated a war with the federal authorities in which they sent the Yugoslav Na-
 tional Army (JNA), led predominantly by Serbian and Montenegrin officers, against
 Croatian towns and cities. The JNA established control over a number of areas
 where Croatian residents of Serbian nationality were predominant, as well as over
 areas where Serbs had been in a minority. The JNA was assisted in this effort by
 paramilitary forces, who invaded from Serbia and Montenegro, and by local Serbian
 irregulars. These elements were often organized and led by regular JNA officers or
 their surrogates and all were directly supplied with weapons and ammunition by
 the JNA.
 On January 3, 1992, after 14 previous cease-fire agreements collapsed, a cease-
 rm negotiated by former US. Secretary of State Cyrus Vance and approved by the
 United Nations Security Council (UNSC) went into effect. The Vance plan provided
 for normalizing the occupied areas through demilitarization, the return of displaced
 persons, and the reestablishment of Croatian government authority, with assur-
 ances for minority populations.: The UNSC in March deployed a multinational mili-
 tary and civilian force called the U.N. Protection Force (UNPROFOR) to the areas
 of Croatia that were occupied by Serbs and established four U.N. Protected Areas
 (UNPA's). Withdrawal of JA units from those areas was supposed to be completed
 in the spring and summer. But many of the soldiers in the JNA units stayed on
 in Serbian-occupied parts of Croatia which became the UNPA's and "converted" to
 the so-called police force or special police. In addition, JNA units continued to oc-
 cupy the Prevlaka Peninsula and the region around Dubrovnik long after they had
 agreed with U.N. negotiators to depart. The last JNA units left only in the first
 week of November. Although the cease-fire was generally observed throughout 1992,
 Serbian armed forces effectively controlled most of the territory in the UNPA's and
 were responsible for many violations of human rights. The Republic of Croatia was
 recognized by the European Community nations on January 15 and by the United
 States on April 8. Serbian "authorities declared the "Serbian Autonomous Region
 of Krajina" ("RSK) on July 18 and set up "governmental" institutions. (The RSK
 appears to have no international acceptance.
 Croatia has a multiparty parliamentary system with a strong president. The
 President, who serves as Chief of State, appoints the Prime Minister and chairs
 both the 23-member Presidential Council and the 14-member Defense Council. In
 August multicandidate presidential and parliamentary elections, the incumbent
 President, Dr. Franjo Tudiman, was reelected to a 5-year term, and his party, the
 Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ), won a majority of seats in the House of Rep-
 resentatives. Elections to the House of Districts will be held in February 1993.
 The Minister of Defense oversees the armed forces, including an army, a nominal
 air force, a small navy, and a national guard reserve. The President is Commander-
 in-Chief of the armed forces. The Ministry of Interior is primarily responsible for
 directing and supervising the police. Both Ministries are headed by civilian officials.
 The Office for the Defense of the Constitution, the head of which is appointed by
 the President and reports directly to him, also plays a role in various areas of inter-
 nal affairs. Despite the Vance plan, local Serbian "authorities" in the UNPA's main-
 tained arsenals of heavy weaponry. The forces in the UNPA's, numbering at most
 17,000 and comprised of paramilitary groups, Serbian "police," "special police," and
 "border police," are directly involved in a continuing pattern of major human rights
 abuses against non-Serbian populations and against other Serbs.
 Croatia is moving from a largely state-owned or "socially owned* economy toward
 a market system. Little progress was achieved in 1992 owing to the costs of the war,
 the spillover effects of the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina in which Croatian forces
 have -been involved, and the burden of caring for refugees from both conflicts. Na-
 tional income fell, while unemployment rose and the rate of inflation approached
 hyperinflation levels.
 Over 400,000 Croats were displaced by the war and its aftermath. There were nu-
 merous substantiated reports of political and other extrajudicial killings in various
 parts of Croatia in 1992. In' the areas of Croatia under the Government's control
 the most serious violations of human rights occurred near the cease-re lines and
 were directed against ethnic Serbs. These violations included killings, disappear-
 ances, physical abuse, illegal detention, house bombings, and loss of employment.
 Serbs continued to be driven from their homes. The Croatian Government has stat-
 ed that all crimes against citizens will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.
 The Government tried and convicted some persons for these violations. In the areas
 of Croatia under the control of ethnic Serbs, who claim that their territory should
 be independent of Croatia, human rights violations included extensive killings, dis-
 appearances, beatings, arbitrary interference with privacy family, and home, and
 forced resettlement or exile-all part of a campaign of "ethnic cleansing" designed
 
 
 742
 to ensure Serbian dominance of the areas. The 'authorities" in these areas showed
 flagrant and systematic disregard for human rights.

 Croatian forces there.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were numerous substantiated
 reports of political and other extrajudicial killings throughout Croatia in 1992. Doc-
 umented killings in areas under local Serbian control were more numerous and
 often involved the complicity of senior local Serbian "authorities." In government-
 controlled territory, there were also credible reports of killings of Serbs.-Senior Min-
 istry of Interior officials announced the arrest on November 27, for example, of four
 policemen from Podravska Slatina and Vocin on suspicion of the murder of a 62-
 year-old Croatian citizen of Serbian nationality.
 In the Serb-controlled areas, murders occurred regularly and there was no docu-
 mented attempt to punish the perpetrators of political and other extrajudicial kill-
 ing. In the UNPA called Sector East (the Vukovar area), for example, a Serbian ex-
 tremist was identified as the gunman in three murders committed in the summer
 of 1992. He was held and released twice by the ethnic Serbian "authorities" who
 control the occupied Croatian city of Vukovar and then was allowed to cross over
 into Serbia after his third arrest.
 b. Disappearance.-Accusations of disappearances continued. Most of the new
 cases arose in Serbian-occupied areas of Croatia, particularly in Sector East. Reli-
 able estimates place the numbers in the high tens or low hundreds.
 The Croatian Commission for Missing Persons attempts to ascertain the where-
 abouts of 13,747 people. Many disappeared during the fightin in 1991, a significant
 number of them after Vukovar fell to Serbian forces in Novemer 1991. A joint com-
 mission of Croatian and Serbian officials from Belgrade is reviewing the question
 of missing and dead. While the group has resolved some cases, the Serbian side has
 not been helpful with cases involving missing Croats last seen under JNA officers'
 control after the fall of Vukovar. An international investigating team believes that
 a mass grave found near Vukovar in October 1992 may be the site of the remains
 of over [70 Croatian soldiers taken alive by JNA officers from the Vukovar hospital.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution prohibits torture or cruel or degrading punishment.
 Persons incarcerated for ordinary crimes are not usually treated harshly. The
 treatment of prisoners of war (POW's) who are still near military front lines and
 of persons suspected of having collaborated with hostile Serbian forces has not met
 international standards. Beatings, detention, and verbal harassment were some-
 times used to enforce compliance with orders and instructions. Beatings of Serbian
 POW's occurred in Croatian jails in Sector West at Daruvar and in detention facili-
 ties in the Split area. The Government fired some police officials who did not take
 sufficiently vigorous steps to prevent beatings and verbal abuse of detainees; none
 was known to have been prosecuted.
 In Serbian-controlled places of detention within Croatia, harsh treatment is com-
 monplace. No action is known to have been taken to punish those who committed
 excesses against non-Serbs.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution contains protections
 from capricious arrest and protections for the accused's legal rights. Judicial or pros-
 ecutorial warrants are required for arrests. Time limits vary or ormal indictments
 depending on the kind and seriousness of the charges and may range from days to
 months. In practice, while these principles are generally upheld in the Croatian-con-
 trolled parts of the country, there have been some exceptions. Near Split, Osijek,
 and Daruvar, ethnic Serbs have periodically been detained without apparent cause
 and sometimes beaten. In Croatian-controlled parts of Sector West, ethnic Serbs de-
 tained without probable cause were not allowed the same rights and privileges
 granted to non-Serbian detainees.
 In early 1992, persons of one nationality (e.g., Serbs) were seized to exchange
 them for captives of the other nationality (i.e., Croats) held by the other side. A-
 though Serbian elements were far more often the perpetrators of such prisoner sei-
 zures, Croats, too, occasionally engaged in this practice.
 In the Serb-controlled areas, virtually no safeguards existed against arbitrary de-
 tention, which was used regularly to intimidate and frighten the non-Serbian popu-
 lation.
 The deliberate expulsion of persons from their homes based on their nationality
 wna a sprinus nrnhlem in 1992. Most of the excesses of this nature committed by
 
 
 743
 Croatian extremists occurred in 1991, with some residual revenge-taking occurring
 in 1992 along the cease-fire lines. In Serb-controlled areas, it is the practice of Ser-
 bian "authorities" to drive out or eliminate non-Serbian persons. Such atrocities
 against non-Serbs, especially in Sectors East and South, numbered in the thou-
 sands.
 e. Denial c# Fair Public Trial.-The Croatian legal system consists of municipal
 and district courts the Supreme Court, and the Constitutional Court specified in
 the Constitution. Tie High Judicial Council appoints judges and public prosecutors.
 The Council has a president and 14 members, drawn largely from among judges
 public prosecutors, Iawyers, and university law professors. -Members of the Council
 are proposed by the House of Districts and elected by the House of Representatives
 for a term of 8 years.
 There is also a military legal system of six courts. Military courts handle offenses
 by those in the armed forces, as well as charges against civilians for offenses involv-
 ing national security. Defendants in military courts have the same legal rights and
 privileges as defendants in civil courts. Military courts in 7 Croatian cities brught
 charges against 8,000 persons, most of them in absentia. These indictments involved
 mostly Serbs who were reportedly assisting the JNA in the 1991 attacks or who
 were active in Serbian paramilitary groups.
 Under the Constitution, a defendant has the right to a fair trial by a competent
 court, to attend the trial, and to have an attorney. In addition, the defendant must
 be informed of the charges and any evidence substantiating those charges and may
 not be forced to admit guilt. There is a presumption of innocence. Evidence illegally
 obtained is not to be adted in court proceeding. An attorney is provided to mdi-
 gent defendants.
 In practice, the prosecuting attorney has a good deal of leeway in deciding wheth-
 er to bring a case against an individual. In a "political" case, both the filing of
 charges and the conduct of trial proceedings may be subject to political influence.
 Critics have argued with the way in which Serbs are charged and convicted under
 section 236(0 of the Croatian Criminal Code, which prohibits "rebellion against the
 State." Critics have argued also that many of the accused were convicted on insuffi-
 cient evidence.
 International legal experts who queried Serbian "authorities" in areas the Serbs
 control found the answers regarding their so-called legal system to be evasive. An-
 other reliable source said no legal system exists in the Serbian-controlled areas.
 So-called "judges" carry out extremist policies directed against non-Serbian mi-
 norities.
 Virtually all detainees in Croatia and the UNPA's are charged and classified as
 criminals. In reality many are held for political reasons, but it difficult to establish
 the number.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution declares that homes are inviolable. Only a court may issue a search
 warrant, and the reasons for the search of a home or other premises must be stated.
 Police may enter without either a warrant or the owner's consent only if necessary
 to enforce an arrest warrant, apprehend a suspect, or to prevent serious danger to
 life or major property. In practice, Croatian authorities do not always adhere to
 these constitutional requirements.
 Serbian "officials" in areas the Serbs control enforce almost no restraint against
 arbitrary interference with the privacy, family, and home of non-Serbs. Serbian "au-
 thorities" and paramilitary forces in Sector East repularly invaded non-Serbs'
 homes, sometimes on the pretense of taking a "census of people and belongings.
 Non-Serbs, including Hungarians and Slovaks, were then pressured by physical in-
 timidation to sign over their property and leave. In isolated homesteads, gunmen
 walked through the targeted farmyards shooting at windows and people in the
 houses. International observers have documented reports of forcible entry into
 homes and the murder or assault of the occupants, mostly old women and men.
 The Constitution guarantepis the safety and secrecy of personal data.
 g. Use of Excessive Force and Violations of Humanitarian Law in Internal Con-
 flicts.-Although the cease-fire changed the dimension of the internal conflict,
 human rights abuses against civilian populations continued throughout the year,
 with Serbs Croats, Hungarians, and Musims all targeted.
 In the UNPA's, violations were the direct result of the practices and policies of
 Serbian "authorities," typically carried out by former JNA troops and Serbian para-
 military units that were transferred to the so-called regular and frontier police to
 circumvent the Vance Plan's demilitarization requirements in the UNPA's.
 "Ethnic cleansing" is commonly and aggressivel employed with Serbian official
 blessing against Croats, Hungarians, Slovaks, Czechs, and other non-Serbs. Numer-
 ous incidents of "ethnic cleansing" occurred. Typically, armed units blockaded a vii-
 
 
 744
 lage and ordered the population to remain at home or to seek permission to move.
 few incidents of this nature reportedly occurred in Croatian-controlled parts of
 Sector West. In the Serbian-controlled areas, "ethnic cleansing' occurred on a mas-
 sive scale including the establishment of strict curfews, prohibition of the move-
 ment of clergy and strict limits on or prohibition of travel between towns and near
 military front fines.
 Forced resettlement also occurred, for example, in the form of bombings and burn-
 ings of homes and businesses of a particular ethnic group designed to compel its
 permanent departure. Vigilante attacks took place against the homes of ethnic
 Sers in Croata. Through October 1992 some 2,753 bombs and 873 suspicious fires
 had exploded or been set throughout 6roatia. These attacks often targeted auto-
 mobiles and businesses but also hit cultural monuments and railroad crossings. In
 the first 9 months of 1992, some 85 Serbian homes were damaged or destroyed
 around Daruvar (Sector West). The Government prosecuted a number of criminals
 for house bombings, and, in one case, eight Creats were recently indicted for such
 activity. The homes of some wealthy Gypsy and Serbian families on the island of
 Krk were damaged by terrorist bombings n 1992.
 Serbian officials in Sector East were especially aggressive in implementing "ethnic
 cleansing" and forcing exile. It was common in Sector East for non-Serbs to be ar-
 rested, beaten, and otherwise aggressively harassed until they ultimately fled. Be-
 fore their departure, the  were orcd "voluntarily'to si   over their property and
 homes to Serbian control. Serbian "officials' in Bosanski Novi, Vukovar, and Dali
 were directly involved in these violations of human rights. Serbian officials' and
 paramilitary groups in Knin, Sector South, continued to expel Crats from Serbian-
 controlled areas into Croatian-controlled territory. These tactics have been a regular
 and continuin practice of Serbian "authorities' in Serb-controlled areas.
 In eastern'roatia, the JNA and Serbian paramilitary units razed Croatian sec-
 tions of towns and entire villages such as Lipik, Nustar, and Vinkovci, delberately
 _destoying house after house to force Crat to flee. Before the oecupation, Baraja
 had a population of 54,000 inhabitants, half of whom were Crosts, but the Serbian
 "authorities" forced out over 20000 Creat and several thousand Hungarians and
 moved in Serb from West Slavonia, Bosnia, and Serbia.
 In the Serbian-controlled area around Vukovar, forced resettlement took on a sub-
 tler twist. According to numerous reliable reports, Serbian "fficials" demanded that
 Croatian  Hunrian, and Slovak families accept Serbian "refugees" into their
 homes. Tihese grefugees" then harassed and tormented their hosts until the latter
 felt compelled to move out, thus "abandoning" their property. Such "abandoned" or
 "donated' property was then used to house Serbian immigrants.
 In another incident, Crests and Hungarians in Ausat and September were fired
 from the brick factory in Ilok, allegedly lbease of falling demand[ for building mate-
 rials. As a result, they lost company-supplied housing and were forced into exile.
 Serbian workers were immediately hired at the factory and moved into the vacated
 houses. The formerly largely Croatian villages of Erdut and lok in Sector East have
 been stripped of their non-Serbian populations, with Slovaks, Croats, and Hungar-
 ians forced to emigrate in fear of their lives.
 Infamous Serbian terrorist warlords operated in Sector East with the ctive sup-
 prt of local Serbian "authorities.' One such paramilitary leader operated two
 "traning centers," openly defying the Vance plan. Warlords from Serbia maintained
 strong connections with the Government there and were suspected of be   intoks be-
 tween the Milosevic Government in Serbia and the Serb-controlled ilPA'e. They
 regularly and with impunity crossed back and forth into Serbia for supplies and ad-
 ditional recruits.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Libertis, Including
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution guarantees freedom of thought
 and expression, which specifically includes freedom of the press and other me -,
 speech, and public expression, but the Government significantly restricted these
 rights. In the Serbian-controlled areas, these rights virtually do not exist.
 The Constitution states that "any call for or incitement to war, or resort to vio-
 lene, national, racial or religious hatred, or an formof intlerance shall be prohib-
 ited and punisrable."aThe right of judicial redress is provided to anyone whose con-
 stitutionally determincd rights have been violated by public communication."
 Croatian authorities responded to certain forms of press criticism with a number
 of what appeared to be politically motivated dismissals of journalists and editors,
 as well as with prosecutions of journalists for alleged libel and dissemination of false
 information. Although these cases were eventually dropped, the indictments had an
 intimidating effect. Moreover during the armed conflict of 1991-92, the Government
 nforcrod tiahtr controls on te ress.
 
 
 745
 In general, journalists were circumspect, when writing on certain political and re-
 ligious to pics, to avoid official ensure. At the same time, however, some newspapers
 occasionally criticized political figres. In December an Osijek local government offi-
 cial revoked the acreditation o-a Slobodna Dalmacija correspondent because of an
 article the journalist had written 2 days earlier criticizing the official.
 One area of continuing controversy was the effect on freedom of the press of ac-
 tions by the Governments Agency for Restructuring and Development, whose man-
 date is to supervise the privatization of "socially owned" property. Critics allege that
 heavy-handed   or  politically  motivated  actions  resulted  in  the  editorial
 straitJacketing or "financial" failure of several high guality independent periodicals,
 including the widely respected Danas and its short-lived successor, Novi Danas. Re-
 cent controversy focusedon the Agency's efforts to compel the reprivatization of the
 respected daily Slobodna Dalmacija in Split by instituting new management. Critics
 argued that governmentimposed management undermined the independence of the
 press and raised doubts about the Government's commitment to press freedom.
 During the presidential and parliamentary election campaign, all newspapers de-
 voted substantial space to each candidate and party platform. Political parties com-
 plained, however, that, due to the great disparity in availability of funding, they
 were not able to compete effectively in buying time for radio and television spots.
 State-owned television gained a reputation of being a messenger for the ruling
 party, reacting sympathetically to the Government's interpretation of events and
 limiting the exposure of opposition spokesmen. One exception was the popular, late
 night public affirs television program "Frame by Frame," which occasionally fea-
 tured interviews with prominent opposition intellectuals and ran footage from inter-
 national and Serbian networks.
 State-owned radio offers a variety of music, news, and interview programming
 but radio frequencies are strictly controlled. To date, the Government has awarded
 a license to only one private sports station, deferring some 40 other applications for
 later review.
 Academic freedom is generally respected in Croatia, but Serbs were being har-
 assed and denied job opportunities because of their nationality.
 In the Serbian-controlled areas, the concept of open debate free of ethnic bias is
 not accepted. For example, in October local police in the Serbian-controlled area of
 Knin began enforcing a ban on outside newspapers and reportedly seized private ra-
 dios and batteries used in transistor radios to prevent Serbs in these Serbian-con-
 trolled areas from learning details of the Croatian amnesty law.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides that
 all citizens shall be guaranteed the right to peaceful assembly and public protest.
 It also guarantees the right to free association for the protection of citizens' interests
 or promotion of social, economic, political, national, cultural, and other convictions
 and objectives. Citizens may freely form, join, and leave political parties, trade
 unions, and other associations.
 Spractie, the rights of peaceful assembly and association are respected in Cro-
 atia. Thia right is enjoyed by other nationalities in Croatia, including Croatians of
 Serbian nationality and Croatian Muslims. In Serbian-ontrolled areas in Croatia,
 these rights are not respected or ejoyed. Many political parties articipating in the
 nationa elections held rallies and demonstrations elsewhere in  roatia without inci-
 dent. Permits are required for rallies, but they are ranted routinely.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-There is no state religon. The Constitution guarantees
 freedom of conscience and religion and free public expression of religious and other
 convictions, It also states that all religious communities are equal before the law
 and shall be separate from the State. Religious communities are free to conduct pub-
 lic religious services and to open and operate schools and social and charitable insti-
 tutions.
 Roman Catholicism, Eastern Orthodox Christianity, and Islam are the main faiths
 in Croatia. The majority of practicing Croats are Roman Catholic, and the Govern-
 ment provides an option of Catholic religious education in the schools. There is an
 active Jewish community, aA well as several Protestant and eastern mystical sects
 or groups. The Jewish community center in Zagreb, damaged by an explosion in
 1991, was rebuilt with te he lp of a loan from the Croatian Government. It re-
 opened in a formal ceremony in September attended by senior government officials
 and world Jewish leaders and serves as a house of worship for believers. Foreign
 cler may live and work in Croatia. No formal restrictions exists on religious pub-
 lishing or education.
 Although there were no formal restrictions on any religious group, religion was
 so closely identified with ethnicity in the former Yugoslavia that religious institu-
 tions were often targeted. The Government listed some 325 Catholic churches and
 chapelsas aseriously damaged or destroyed, many of them specifically targeted by
 
 
 746
 Serbian forces. In addition, 44 monasteries, 17 Orthodox churches, 4 synagogues,
 and 7 Protestant churches, as well as many cemeteries, were attacked, damaged,
 and looted. There are two mosques in Croatia, and some half dozen or so Islamic
 community centers which serve as locations for prayer and worship. The Islamic
 community center in Dubrovnik was destroyed by Serbian shelling, and another in
 Osjek was damaged, also by Serbian artillery. The destruction of Orthodox church-
 es in Croatia and the bombings of Catholic churches in the Serbian-controlled areas
 continued in 1992. For example, in Sector East around Vukovar, five Catholic
 churches were leveled by explosions in August and September. An Orthodox church
 in Varazdin was bombed and slightly damaged by a disgruntled Croatian refugee
 who was arrested and charged with the crime.
 There is a Serbian Orthodox cathedral in downtown Zagreb which has remained
 undamaged throughout the war. One of Croatia's two major mosques is also located
 in Zagreb. It not only serves a religious function but also has been the temporary
 residence for hundreds of Bosnian refugees.
 Serbian community leaders expressed concern over what they described as pres-
 sures to convert from Orthodoxy to Catholicism. Some reportedly believed that the
 option of religious education in schools placed ethnic Serbian children at a social
 disadvantage when their parents declined that option. There is virtually no freedom
 of religion for non-Orthodox believers in Serbian-controlled areas.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Constitution states that anyone who is lawfully in the territory of
 Croatia shall have the right freely to move and choose a residence. Any citizen has
 the right at any time to leave, permanently or temporarily settle abroad, and return
 home. The right of movement within Croatia and the right to enter or leave it may
 be restricted by law if necessary to protect the legal order or the health, rights, and
 freedoms of others.
 The war in Croatia and the Serbian practice of "ethnic cleansing" both in Croatia
 and Bosnia and Herzegovina left Croatia host to some 700,000 refugees and dis-
 laced persons, of whom 264,000 are from other regions of Croatia and 430,000 from
 Bosnia and Herzegovina. The ethnic mix of this total is impossible to quantify;prob-
 ably most of the Bosnian refugees are Muslims. The great majority of the Croat-
 origin refugees and displaced persons are housed with local families. The Muslims
 occupy camps and public facilities.
 Following the large influx of refugees, the Croatian Government altered its de-
 clared policy to prohibit the entry of new refugees unless they were guaranteed pas-
 sage to third countries. In practice, many refugees have entered Croatia, but the re-
 lease of prison camp detainees held in Bosnia to go to the transit camp at Karlovac
 in Croatia has been timed to ensure a flow of detainees to other countnes. The Gov-
 ernment imposes no significant restrictions on the movement of these refugees and
 displaced persons. The bureaucracy was criticized for slowness in meeting the mo-
 mentous task of issuing new passports and residence permits. Many non-Croats sug-
 gested that the delay in processing their cases was the result of discrimination.
 There is reason to believe that the applications of persons not born in Croatia, or
 who held significant positions in such federal institutions as the JNA, were not proc-
 essed expeditiously.
 Despite the establishment of UNPA's, the goals of the Vance plan were not met.
 At the end of the year, over one-fourth o'l Croatia was still controlled by hostile Ser-
 bian elements sustained by links with the Serbian Government in Belgrade. No
 Croats or Muslims were able to return to their homes in Serbian-controlled areas.
 In fact, Serbian authorities actively promoted the resettlement of their own ethnic
 groups in the areas under their control, thereby making it much harder to reverse
 the results of "ethnic cleansing." In this context, there was freedom of movement
 only for the dominant ethnic group and only in the area that ethnic group con-
 trolled. Nevertheless, a number of Serbian families did return to the Croatian-con-
 trolled part of Sector West and to the area around Osijek (close to UNPA Sector
 East).
 Travel in the UNPA's differs from travel elsewhere in Croatia, where foreigners
 and members of international organizations have no problem. In the Croatian-con-
 trolled portion of Sector West, everyone traveling needs proper identification. In Ser-
 bian-controlled areas, it is unwise for non-Serbian Croats to travel.
 The Constitution states that foreign citizens and stateless persons may obtain
 asylum unless they are sought for nonpolitical crimes and activities contrary to the
 basic principles of international law. No alien who legally finds himself in Croatia
 may be banished or extradited unless a decision made in accordance with a treaty
 or law is to be enforced. At the request of the Government of Bosnia and
 Herzegovina and in accord with a bilateral cooperation agreement, however, Cro-
 atian authorities in several instances refused to acceot for entry into Croatia some
 
 
 747
 Bosnian males liable for military service. There were also instances in which Cro-
 atian authorities returned draft-age males to Bosnia and Herzegovina after they
 had entered Croatia.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Croats have had the right to change their government since April-May 1990
 when, in multiparty parliamentary elections, the opposition Croatian Democratic
 Union (CDU) won 43 percent of the popular vote, as compared to 27 percent for the
 ruling party, the League of Communists of Croatia-Party of Democratic Change. The
 National Assembly (Parliament) elected the CDU candidate, Dr. Franjo Tudjman, as
 President. After passage of legislation reorganizing the Parliament, multicandidate
 presidential and parliamentary elections were again held on August 2, 1992. Dr.
 Tudjman was reelected as President to a 5-year term with 57 percent of the popular
 vote. Under the Croatian system, the President exercises considerable power, au-
 thority, and influence but is limited to two terms of office. His party, the CDU, won
 85 seats out of 138 in the main chamber of Parliament. Elections to the second
 chamber, the House of Districts, are planned for 1993.
 The elections were generally considered to be fair and valid, but some Western
 observers pointed out serious flaws centering around displaced persons' participa-
 tion in the voting, composition of voter registries, civic education, and application
 of citizenship laws. While there was some concern that the Government did not do
 enough to instill public confidence in the integrity of the electoral system, opposition
 parties who participated in the contest generally accepted the results. The Govern-
 ment implemented procedures that allowed refugees of Croatian nationality from
 Serb-contrlled areas to vote not just for President but also for local parliamentary
 representatives. Allegations of intimidation of voters were not substantiated. An ob-
 server delegation from the European Council judged the elections overall as almost
 unqualifiedly free and fair.
 There is no restriction in law or practice on women or minorities participating in
 politics or government. Four women hold seats in Parliament, one of whom serves
 as a Vice President and another leads one of the larger opposition parties.
 Federal election law provides for representation of all minorities in Parliament,
 with proportional representation guaranteed for any minority that makes up more
 than 8 percent of the population. Serbs, who at 11 percent of the population are the
 only minority who met this qualification, would receive 13 seats according to the for-
 mula. Because most Serbian Croats lived in the Serb-controlled areas and were
 therefore unable to vote, the Federal Election Commission will choose 13 Serbs to
 "represent" the Serbian minority in the designated parliamentary seats. The 13
 Serbs were designated and now sit in Parliament. Croatia has its own election laws
 and is presently completing laws about electing the House of Parishes.
 Although the Serbian Democratic Party, based largely in the Serb-dominated
 areas of Croatia, won several seats in the 1990 elections and one of its deputies be-
 came Vice President of the National Assembly, Serbian "authorities" did not make
 it possible for those under their control to participate in the 1992 elections. The elec-
 tions held by the Serbian "authorities" for the Serb-controlled and other Serbian
 "paaliaments" were not considered to have been open and fair and were not recog-
 nized as legitimate.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigations of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Domestic human rights monitors are active in government-controlled territory and
 reportedly did not meet government interference. The Government at the highest
 level met with representatives of human rights groups and provided information
 about human rights issues. Serbian "authorities" in the areas under Serbian control
 deny violations of human rights there.
 Section 5. Discrimination Bdsed on Race, Sex, Religion, Language, or Social Status
 The Constitution specifies that all citizens shall enjoy all rights and freedoms, re-
 gardless of race, color, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or
 social origin, property, birth, education, social status, or other attributes. It also
 states that members of all nationalities and minorities shall have equal rights in
 Croatia. One article provides for wartime measures but says that restrictions shall
 be appropriate to the nature of the danger and may not result in the inequality of
 citizens on the basis of race, color, sex, language, religion, or national or social ori-
 gin.
 Constitutionally, ethnic Serbs in Croatia enjoy the same protection as other mi-
 nnrities in the country. In oractice. however, there continue to be many cases of se-

 rious discrimination against individuals based on their Serbian nationality, as noted
 inthe preceding sections of this report.
 Women appear to suffer more than men from the impact of unemployment associ-
 ated with the severe war-related economic downturn. Although, in general, there is
 equal pay for equal work, women who held lower scale jobs were dismissed sooner
 than men. Reliable information on the extent of spouse abuse and other violence
 against women was not available. There is no legal barrier or discrimination in in-
 heritance, marriage, and family laws and property rights of women.
 Sex-based support groups are relatively new in Croatia. Zagreb and several other
 large cities have started family crisis associations. There is no impediment in law
 or practice to the establishment of such groups. For example, an association of the
 "Women of Vukovar," who have relatives missing from the war in the east, is active
 in Zagreb and operates without hindrance. In Zagreb, the Croatian women's group
 Tresnjevka is working to open a support center for wartime rape victims from
 Bosnia.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-All workers, except military and police personnel,
 may form or join unions of their own choosing without prior authorization. There
 is an active labor movement in Croatia with three national labor federations and
 independent associations of both blue-collar and white-collar members. In general,
 unions are independent of the Government and political parties.
 The right to strike is guaranteed in the Constitution but is limited in the armed
 forces, police, government administration, and public services. Certain clerical staff
 have a right to strike, but "essential services" personnel must remain on duty. Re-
 tention of plice personnel on duty is a particularly sensitive topic. In 1991 virtually
 all of the Serbs in the Serbian-dominated police forces went over to the JNA in the
 war, contributing directly to the breakdown of law and order, which continues to
 be a problem. Several short work stoppages occurred during 1992 over wages and
 working conditions. Most of the strikers agreed to accept an improvement in wages
 and modest changes in working conditions.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Collective bargaining is pro-
 tected by law and practiced freely. Because of inflation, the major public service
 unions sought relief through renegotiation of minimum wage agreements with the
 Government. In October they expressed their dissatisfaction with the Government,
 which did not meet its obligation to ensure a minimum wage level agreed to earlier
 in the month. The Government finally agreed to stand by its original minimum
 wage offer.
 There are no export processing zones in Croatia.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced or compulsory work is for-
 bidden and is not known to exist.
 d. Minimum Ae for Employment of Children.-The minimum age for youth em-
 ployment is 16. Under the Constitution, children may not be employed before reach-
 ingthe legally determined age, nor may they be forced or allowed to do work which
 is harmful to their health or morality. Young people are entitled to special protec-
 tion at work.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-There are national minimum wage standards.
 In early October, public service unions, pacesetters for the rest of the work force,
 won agreement on a new monthly minimum wage. But in late October the Govern-
 ment announced that severe economic conditions prohibited it from meeting that
 pay objective. Moreover, severe economic conditions related to the disruption caused
 by the war ensured that many companies were not able or willing to meet those
 standards. The minimum wage is not suffcient to provide a worker and family a
 decent living standard.
 The basic national regulations include provisions for a 42-hour workweek, over-
 time pay, a half-hour daily break, and a minimum of 18 days of paid vacation annu-
 ally. Health and safety standards are set by the Government and enforced by the
 Ministry of Health. In practice, industries generally are not diligent in meeting
 these protection standards.
