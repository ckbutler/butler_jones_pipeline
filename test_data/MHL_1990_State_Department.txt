 MARSHALL ISLANDS
 The Republic of the Marshall Islands is a nation of 31
 low-lying coral atolls scattered over 750,000 square miles of
 the Central Pacific, comprising a total land area of about 70
 square miles. The population, of Micronesian origin, is
 estimated at 43,000. Some two-thirds of the population is
 concentrated on Majuro and Kwajalein atolls. The Marshall
 Islands constituted part of the Trust Territory of the Pacific
 Islands, administered by the United States from 1947 to 1986
 pursuant to an-agreement with the United Nations. In October
 1986, the Republic of the Marshall Islands became a sovereign,
 self-governing nation under the Compact of Free Association
 with the United States.
 Political legitimacy in the Marshall Islands rests on the
 popular will expressed by majority vote in accordance with a
 Constitution uniquely blending British and American precepts,
 including a strong, American-style bill of rights. The
 legislature consists of the Parliament, known as the Nitijela,
 with 33 members and a Council of Chiefs (Iroij), the latter
 serving largely a consultative function on matters dealing
 with custom and traditional practice. The executive branch of
 the Government consists of the President and his appointed
 Cabinet, all of whom are elected members of the Nitijela. The
 President is elected by majority vote from among the
 membership of the Nitijela. The Constitution established an
 independent judiciary.
 Under the Compact of Free Association the United States is
 responsible for defense and national security. Consequently,
 the Marshall Islands has no security forces of its own aside
 from national and local police forces, which are firmly under
 the control of the civil authorities.
 The economy depends mainly on transfer payments from the
 United States. Coconut oil and copra exports, a small amount
 of tourism, and the fishing industry also generate limited
 revenues.
 No human rights abuses were reported in 1990.

 MARSHALL ISLANDS
 In 1988 a law was passed prohibiting political activity by
 aliens. An offending alien is subject to deportation at the
 discretion of the Cabinet. Although the law has never been
 invoked, its invocation could result in deportation without
 due process.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation{ of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 There have been no reported allegations of human rights
 violations by the Government or any known requests for
 investigations. There are no local nongovernmental
 organizations that concern themselves with human rights. The
 Republic is not a member of the United Nations, and the
 Government has not taken an active interest in international
 human rights matters.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 The Constitution prohibits discrimination on the basis of
 gender, race, color, language, religion, political or other
 opinion, national or social origin, place of birth, family
 status, or descent. No instances of such discrimination were
 reported.
 Allegations of violence against women are rare and relate
 mainly to domestic conflict. Assault is a criminal offense,
 but in some cases women are reluctant to prosecute their
 spouses. Women's groups have held infrequent meetings to
 publicize women's issues and to create a greater awareness of
 the rights of women.
 Inheritance of property and traditional rank is matrilineal,
 with women occupying positions of importance within the
 traditional system. No instances of unequal pay for equal
 work or sex-related job discrimination were reported.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 The Constitution provides for the right of free association in
 general. This freedom of association is interpreted by the
 Attorney General of the Marshall Islands as allowing the
 existence of labor unions, although none has been formed yet.
 The Constitution is silent on the right to strike, and thus
 far the Government has not addressed this issue.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 There is no legislation concerning collective bargaining or
 trade union organization. However, there are no bars to the
 organization of trade unions or to collective bargaining.
 There are no special economic areas, and labor standards and
 practices are the same throughout the islands.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 The Constitution specifically prohibits involuntary servitude,
 and there is no evidence of its practice.
