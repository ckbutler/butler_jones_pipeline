 MAURITIUS
 Mauritius is a parliamentary democrac governed by a Prime Minister, a Council
 of Ministers, and a National Assembly. The Head of State is the President, who is
 nominated by the Prime Minister and confirmed by the Assembly, and whose pow-
 ers are largely ceremonial. Fair and orderly national and local elections, supervised
 by an independent commission, take place at regular intervals, most recently in
 1995. The judiciary is independent, there are numerous political parties, both large
 and small, and partisan politics are open and robust.
 A paramilitary Special Mobile Force and Special Supporting Units under civilian
 control are responsible for internal security. These forces, under the command of the
 Commissioner of Police, are backed by a general duty police force. They are largely
 apolitical and generally well-trained, but the police committed some human rights
 abuses.
 The economy is based on labor-intensive, export-oriented manufacturing (mainly
 textiles), as well as sugar and tourism. About 85 percent of arable land is planted
 with sugar cane. There is a generally high standard of living;, annual per capita in-
 come is a pproximately $3,195. The country weathered well the global economic slow-
 down of the early 1990's and is now attempting to diversify its economy by promot-
 ing investment in new sectors, such as electronics, and developing the country as
 a regional financial center.
 The Government's human rights record improved, but problem areas remained.
 There continued to be occasional reports that police abused suspects and detainees.
 The Government continued to use the National Intelligence Unit to monitor opposi-
 tion party activities. On at least two occasions the police denied demonstration per-
 mits, which are normally routinely granted. Violence against women and child labor
 appeared to be on the rise, despite government efforts to address these problems.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political killings.
 The investigation into the 1994 case of a suspect in police custody who burned
 to death in his cell is complete but the district magistrate has not communicated
 his findings to the Director of Public Prosecutions.
 In December a suspect held in a police holding cell for 3 nights died of multiple
 blows. The Commissioner of Police called for an investigation, but observers com-
 plained that the police should not be responsible for investigating themselves in
 such matters.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The law prohibits torture and inhuman punishment, but there were several unoffi-
 cial reports of police brutality, involving mistreatment of individuals on the street
 as welas of suspects in custody. One prisoner died in custody as result of multiple
 blows. (See Section L.a.).
 Because of the Police Commissioner's crackdown on crime, prisons have become
 overcrowded and prison sanitation inadequate.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution prohibits arbitrary ar-
 rest, detention, or exile and the Government generally observes these prohibitions.
 A 1994 constitutional amendment allows the police to hold a person arrested or de-
 
 
 184
 tained for a drug offense without bail until a final determination has been made
 in the case. Parliament has not enacted implementing legislation or otherwise speci-
 fied which drug offenses will be covered by this amendment (see Section 1.e.).
 The Government does not use exile as a means of political control.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution provides for an independent judi-
 ciary, and the Government generally respects this provision in practice. Some critics
 believed that the executive interfered with the judiciary. Legal experts noted con-
 cern about overt manipulation of the judiciary as well as political influence over the
 Commissioner of Police, the Director of Public Prosecutions, and the Anticorruption
 Tribunal.
 The judicial system consists of the Supreme Court, which has appellate powers,
 and a series of lower courts. Final appeal may be made to the Judicial Committee
 in the United Kingdom (the Privy Council). There are no political or military courts.
 The judiciary provides citizens with a fair judicial process.
 Defendants have the right to private or court-appointed counsel. The 1995 draft
 dangerous drugs act, which would permit law enforcement authorities to hold sus-
 pected drug traffickers for up to 36 hours without access to bail or legal counsel,
 is being examined by a select committee before it is considered by the National As-
 sembly. The constitutionality of the law may be questioned.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f, Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 sanctity of the home is provided for in law and generally respected in practice.
 Search of personal property or premises is allowed only under clearly specified con-
 ditions by court order or by police action to stop a crime in progress. The Govern-
 ment's intelligence apparatus continued to carry out illegal surveillance of local op-
 position leaders and other major figures.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech
 and of the press, and the Government generally respects these rights in practice.
 Debate in the National Assembly is lively and open. There were occasional com-
 plaints of government influence in editorial policies, but more than a dozen privately
 owned daily, weekly, and monthly newspapers presented varying political view-
 points, and they expressed partisan views freely. The Government has the ability
 to counter press criticism by using strict libel laws; however, the Government did
 not use these laws to inhibit the press in 1996. Libel suits between private parties
 are common.
 The Government monopoly in broadcasting continued, after the Ramgoolam Gov-
 ernment took office in December 1995 and postponed introduction of legislation to
 liberalize the radio and television industries, saying that it needed to review the
 1995 report that the previous Government had commissioned. Television and radio
 news reporting maintained a progovernment slant which drew sharp criticism from
 newspaper editors. Under a new management team, Mauritius Broadcasting Cor-
 poration began to allow opposition figures slightly more air time. "Sky News from
 the Unitedlingdom and "Canal Plus" from France are available to the public on
 a subscription basis.
 The Government generally respects academic freedom but has occasionally
 censored books, usually citing national security reasons.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 these rights, and the Government generally respects them in practice. Police permis-
 sion is required for demonstrations and mass meetings; such permission is rarely
 refused and groups have the right to challenge denials. The Commissioner of Police
 denied at least two permits for demonstrations. One denial was based on a par-
 liamentary act disallowing public gatherings on days during which the Parliament
 is sitting, although exceptions to the act had been made in the past. The permit de-
 nial was not delivered at least 48 hours prior to the planned demonstration, as is
 customary, and police arrested 11 labor leaders who attended. Their cases were
 pending.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the
 Government respects this right in practice.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Constitution provides for these rights, and the Government re-
 spects them in practice.
 There are no refugees, and the Government deals with asylum requests on a case
 by case basis. The issue of the provision of first asylum has never arisen. There
 were no reports of forced return of persons to a country where they feared persecu-
 tion.
 
 
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The Constitution provides citizens with the right peacefully to change their gov-
 ernment, and citizens exercise this right in practice. Free and fair elections based
 on universal suffrage were held in December 1995. The opposition coalition won all
 elected seats in the National Assembly, and Labor Party leader Navinchandra
 Ramgoolam was sworn in as Prime Minister, replacing Anerood Jugnauth, who had
 led the Government since 1982.
 The remote and isolated islands of Agalega and St. Brandon are an exception to
 universal suffrage. Their nearly 500 citizens are not registered as voters and have
 no representation in Parliament.
 In the National Assembly, up to eight members are appointed through a "best
 loser" system to ensure that all ethnic groups are represented. Political parties often
 match the ethnicity of their candidates to the ethnic composition of particular elec-
 toral districts.
 Six of the 66 members of the Assembly are women.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 A variety of human rights groups operate without government restriction, inves-
 tigating and publishing their findings on human rights cases. Government officials
 are cooperative and responsive to their views.
 In October Mauritius hosted the 20th Ordinary Session of the African Commission
 on Human and Peoples' Rights. Mauritian NGO's actively participated in the NGO
 workshop that preceded the event. Issues such as the Dangerous Drug Act and
 stringent immigration policies were debated openly.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution specifically prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, caste,
 place of origin, political opinion, color, creed, or sex. The Government generally re-
 spects these provisions.
 Women.-Violence against women, particularly spousal abuse, is widespread and
 increasing, according to the Ministry of Women's Rights and Family Welfare, attor-
 neys, and NGO's. In 1995 the number of reported cases of domestic violence against
 women rose to 966 compared with 425 in 1994. In the first half of 1996, 1,062 cases
 were reported to Children and Women Protection unit. The Government is working
 to increase awareness of the problem and to provide relief for victims by providing
 counseling and temporary shelter. It is also promulgating a law that would specifi-
 cally address domestic violence. There are no special legal provisions concerning
 family violence. Police are generally reluctant to become involved in cases of spousal
 abuse.
 Women have traditionally occupied a subordinate role in society, and societal dis-
 crimination continues. Nearly half of Mauritian women work outside the home.
 Children.-The Government placed strong emphasis on the health and welfare of
 children, and displayed a commitment to expand educational opportunities for chil-
 dren. Reported incidents of child abuse are infrequent and isolated, although private
 voluntary organizations claim that the problem is more widespread than publicly ac-
 knowledged. At present, most government programs are administered by the state-
 funded National Children's Council, which provides counseling and investigates re-
 ports of child abuse as well as remedial action to protect affected children.
 People With Disabilities.-There is no discrimination against disabled persons in
 employment, education, or in the provision of other state services. The law requires
 organizations which employ more than 10 people to set aside at least 3 percent of
 their positions for people with disabilities. The law does not, however, reuire that
 work sites be accessible to the disabled, making it difficult for people wit disabil-
 ities to fill many jobs. There is no law mandating access to public buildings or facili-
 ties.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-Tensions between the Hindu majority and
 Creole and Muslim minorities persist. A 1995 law that would have favored Hindu
 children in educational opportunities brought racial tension to the forefront during
 the December 1995 electoral campaign. The law was struck down by the Supreme
 Court and the tension eased, but bitterness remains, and the Creole and Muslim
 minorities attempted to keep public attention focused on alleged societal injustices
 against them. In March a soccer match erupted into a riot when spectators realized
 that Mauritian Muslims were cheering for an Egyptian team instead of the
 Mauritian team. Creole political groups claimed that cases of brutality by the pre-
 dominantly Hindu police force are perpetrated almost exclusively against Creoles.
 
 
 There were numerous credible reports of the predominantly Hindu police force mis-
 treating the predominantly Creole population of Rodrigues.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution explicitly protects the right of
 workers to associate in trade unions, and there is an active trade union movement.
 More than 300 unions represent over 100,000 workers, more than 20 percent of the
 total work force. With the exception of members of the "disciplined force' (i.e., the
 police and the Special Mobile Force) and persons in state services who are not public
 officers (e.g., contractors), workers are free to form and join unions and to organize
 in all sectors including in the export processing zone (EPZ). In the EPZ, however,
 only 10 percent of the work force is unionized, and employers continued to intimi-
 date prospective union members. Labor unions are independent from the Govern-
 ment. U  onspresswagedemands, establish ties to domesticpolitical parties, and
 address political issues.lUnions are free to establish federations.
 Under the Industrial Relations Act (IRA), unions have the legal right to strike.
 In practice, however, the IRA requires a p restrike 21-day cooling-off period, followed
 by binding arbitration, which has the effact of making most strikes illegal. Mor-
 over, the IRA states that worker participation in an unlawful strike is sufficient
 grounds for dismissal, but workers may seek remedy in the industrial court if they
 believe that their dismissal is unjustified. According to Ministry of Labor statistics,
 there were five work stoppages.
 Statutory minimum wagelevels in the export processing zone (EPZ) are somewhat
 lower than elsewhere, but due to the country's labor shortage, actual wage levels
 are nearly double the minimum wage. Under the law, unions may and do establish
 ties with international labor bodies.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The law protects the right of
 employees to bargain collectively with their employers. However, the collective bar-
 gaining process is weakened by excessive government intervention in the form of
 wage-settingin the state sector, which is generaliy used as the basis for private-
 sector pay. Wages are set by the National Remuneration Board, whose chairman is
 appointed by the Minister of Labor. About 12 percent of the labor force works for
 national or local government. The IRA prohibits antiunion discrimination. There is
 an arbitration tribunal which handles any such complaints.
 The EPZ employs about 90,000 people. While there are some EPZ-specflc labor
 laws, such as prvisions allowing EPZ employers to require up to 10 hours per week
 of paid overtime from their employees, workers in this sector enjoy the same basic
 protections as non-EPZ workers.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced or compulsory labor is pro-
 hibited by law, and not practiced in fact.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The legal minimum age for em-
 ployment of children is 15 years. The Ministry of Labor is responsible for enforce-
 ment and conducts frequent inspections. A threefold increase in the number of un-
 derage workers found by government inspectors in latter half of 1995 over the same
 period in 1994 led to increased government inspections. Inspectors issued warnings
 to the culpable employers. The Government estimated that children make up 0.7
 percent of the work force. Child labor in homes, on farms, and in shops is common
 in Rodrigues, which remained difficult to monitor.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-WThe Government administratively establishes
 minimum wages, which vary according to the sector of employment, and it man-
 dates minimum wage increases each year based on inflation. The minimum wage
 for an unskilled worker in the EPZ is about $11.55 (231.28 rupees) per week effec-
 tive July 1, while the lowest weekly wage for a non-EPZ worker is about $12.50
 (250.05 rupees). While this is significantly below the level needed to provide an ac-
 ceptable standard of living, the actual market wag for most workers is much higher
 due to the present labor shortage.
 The standard legal workweek in the industrial sector is 45 hours. In the EPZ an
 employee may be rqireed to work an additional 10 hours per week, although at
 a higher hourly wage.
 The Government responded to a 1995 complaint to the International Labor Orga-
 nization regarding the wages and livin conditions of foreign workers by increasing
 the number of inspections carried out by the Foreign Labor Inspection Squad. O-"
 servers complain that the inspectors are easily bribed and are the only people al-
 lowed access to foreign workers who are not being otherwise protected by the labor
 laws.
 The Government sets health and safety standards, and Ministry of Labor officials
 inspct working conditions and ensure compliance with the 1988 Occupational Safe-
 ty, Health, and Welfare Act. The small number of inspectors limits the Govern-
 
 
 ment's enforcement ability, but the number of occupational accidents has been cut
 nearly in half since the act's passage. Workers have the right to remove themselves
 from dangerous situations without jeopardy to continued employment.
