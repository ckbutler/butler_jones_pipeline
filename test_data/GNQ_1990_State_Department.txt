 EQUATORIAL GUINEA
 Equatorial Guinea is a one-party state headed by President
 Obiang Nguema Mbasogo who, in 1979, overthrew the ruthless
 dictatorship of Francisco Macias. In 1982 a constitution was
 promulgated, national and local assemblies were selected, and
 Obiang officially declared the Government to be civilian. In
 1986 Obiang established Equatorial Guinea's sole legal
 political party, the Democratic party of Equatorial Guinea
 (DPEG). This party, made up mostly of members of Obiang's
 Fang tribe from Rio Muni, the country's mainland region,
 controls the Government without viable opposition. Only party
 members may hold elective offices. In August 1989, Obiang
 staged the first presidential election since 1968; as the only
 candidate, he was elected to a 7-year term.
 Police and internal security forces are responsible for public
 order. They are augmented by a 350 to 500 man presidential
 guard unit provided by Morocco. The civilian police and
 internal security forces historically have committed the
 majority of human rights abuses.
 The population of Equatorial Guinea, estimated at 350,000,
 lives mainly by subsistence agriculture, fishing, and
 hunting. Per capita annual income is approximately $457. The
 small wage economy, based on cocoa, lumber, and coffee, has
 not recovered from the devastation caused by the death or
 exodus of thousands of trained and educated citizens during
 the tyrannical Macias era. Nevertheless, a very small middle
 class has emerged in recent years, and membership in the West
 Africa franc currency zone since 1985 has improved economic
 performance and helped to create greater fiscal integrity.
 Equatorial Guinea still remains heavily dependent on foreign
 aid; Spain, the former colonial power, and France are the key
 donors.
 Political rights of all kinds, including freedom of speech and
 assembly, continued to be tightly restricted in Equatorial
 Guinea in 1990, and police brutality remained a significant
 problem. -There was no indication that the Government intended
 to open up the system or to allow any sort of legal
 opposition. However, in September the President established a
 commission of the national legislature to monitor human rights
 conditions, apparently in response to reports from Amnesty
 International (AI) of serious human rights abuses. Given the
 subservience of the legislature to the executive, there seemed
 little likelihood that the commission would be an effective
 restraint on human rights abuses.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 No such killings were reported in 1990.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no known disappearances.

 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment.
 There have been repeated credible reports that police and
 other security forces frequently resort to torture and other
 cruel forms of mistreatment of detainees. These reports
 indicate that the authorities employ a wide variety of
 techniques, including severe beatings, electric shock
 treatments, and hanging victims by their feet. AI in its 1990
 report stated that Jose Primo Esono Mica had been tortured in
 1989 by having his legs and arms tied behind him, causing his
 back to arch painfully, and then being suspended by a rope.
 The Government denied he had been tortured but released him in
 March and deported him to Spain (see Section 2.d.).
 AI continued to report alleged instances of torture during
 1990, including the cases of Jose Eneme, until January 1990
 Equatorial Guinea's consul in Douala, Cameroon, and Juan Eyeme
 Nguema, former head of the National Institute of Social
 Security. The Government denied that either man had been
 tortured. In the case of Jose Eneme, it claimed that he had
 been tried for embezzling government funds. In fact, Eneme's
 arrest appeared tied to accusations that he was responsible
 for the death by witchcraft of his vice consul, a relative of
 President Obiang, who died following an automobile accident.
 The Government released Nguema in July, but Eneme remained in
 jail at the end of 1990.
 In October 1989, two police officials were convicted of
 physically abusing a British subject on contract with the
 World Bank and sentenced to several months in prison. One of
 the officials, the son of a cabinet minister, was not
 imprisoned but spent his sentence under house arrest at his
 home in Malabo. He was subsequently dismissed from the police.
 Prison conditions continued to be extremely harsh. Basic
 amenities were unavailable, and prisoners' essential needs
 were largely supplied by their families or friends. At least
 some prisoners were set free 1 day a week to forage for food.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Despite constitutional provisions, there was little
 enforcement of the rights of persons in detention to be
 charged or released within a reasonable period of time,-to
 have access to a lawyer, or to be released on bail. Arbitrary
 arrests by security forces or police are commonplace, often on
 spurious charges, in order to extort money. Many detainees
 are held incommunicado. The number of political detainees
 held at the end of 1990 was not known.
 The Government continues to encourage exiles to return to
 Equatorial Guinea, assuring them that they will not be
 persecuted. At the same time, however, the Government makes
 it clear that political activity outside the party will not be
 tolerated. Although Severo Moto, leader of the outlawed
 Progress Party, visited Equatorial Guinea without incident in
 1988, other political exiles have not been so fortunate. Jose
 Luis Jones Dougan, an associate of Moto, and Jose Primo Esono
 Mica returned to Equatorial Guinea in 1988. Both were
 arrested and convicted of complicity in an alleged coup plot
 and sentenced to long prison terms. After AI and others took
 an interest in their cases, Jones Dougan was released in
 December 1988 and Esono Mica in March 1990. Both returned to
 
 
 EQUATORIAL GUINEA
 Spain. Others convicted at the same time, including Francisco
 Bonifacio Mba Nguema, remain in jail.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 There is a formal court structure, with the Supreme Court at
 the apex, and also military and customary (tribal) court
 systems. Tribal laws and customs are honored in the formal
 court system when not in conflict with national law. The
 tribunal provided for in the Constitution to decide
 constitutional issues has never been established. Under the
 Constitution, military tribunals hear all capital cases.
 There is no separation between the executive and the
 judiciary, and Supreme Court justices serve at the pleasure of
 the President. The executive branch acts with little respect
 or understanding for judicial independence. Laws are
 frequently enacted by decree without any public announcement,
 except for an occasional brief mention on the government radio.
 The nation's mixture of traditional (tribal) law, military
 law, and Spanish rules and procedures combines to produce an
 inconsistent system of justice. Judges and court officials
 are poorly trained. There is little concept of due process,
 and appellate proceedings are nonexistent. Defendants unable
 to afford legal counsel stand little chance of acquittal. The
 fact that the few lawyers (approximately 20) in the country
 depend on their connections to the Government for a livelihood
 raises questions about the impartiality of the defense their
 clients might receive. Unless represented by counsel, those
 arrested in Equatorial Guinea usually have no way of knowing
 if the-offense they have been charged with is bona fide.
 The Government has begun to address the need for judicial
 reform and development. Spain and the United Nations Human
 Rights Commission (UNHRC) jointly financed a visit to
 Equatorial Guinea by two senior Spanish judges to review the
 court system and civil registry and to make recommendations
 for improving them. The judges will present a report to the
 UNHRC in Geneva and to the Governments of Spain and Equatorial
 Guinea. The report, due in January 1991, will recommend
 measures to improve Equatorial Guinea's judicial system and
 respect for human rights. Spain also agreed to train judges
 who would then serve on the Supreme Court.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Government sometimes places under surveillance persons it
 deems suspicious. While many believe telephone conversations
 are routinely monitored, there seems to be no deliberate
 interference with correspondence. Although required by the
 Constitution, search warrants are not normally used.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Public criticism of the Government is not tolerated. There is
 a small weekly newspaper owned by the Government, which never
 criticizes the Government. The Government owns and, with
 assistance from the Spanish Government, operates the only
 television and radio stations. Local news is government
 produced and contains no criticism of the Government.

 EQUATORIAL GUINEA
 International news items are generally supplied by the Spanish
 agency EFE, United States Information Agency, and other
 sources. Although there were no known cases of confiscation
 of foreign publications brought into the country by travelers
 in 1990, distribution of foreign publications critical of the
 Government is forbidden.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Despite constitutional provisions guaranteeing these freedoms,
 the Government's firm position is that opposition political
 organizations and assemblies will not be tolerated. Private
 nonpolitical groups, such as professional organizations,
 churches,. and sports groups, require government approval to
 hold meetings.
 c. Freedom of religion
 With one exception, freedom of religion is generally
 respected. Jehovah's Witnesses, originally banned from the
 country in 1985 and harassed in 1986 and 1987, are still
 prohibited. Foreign clergy and missionaries continue to have
 an active role in educational development. All denominations
 are allowed to participate in charitable as well as religious
 activities. Christianity, mainly Roman Catholicism, is the
 predominant religion. In general, active proselytizing by
 Protestant denominations is discouraged, but conversions are
 permitted. Government permission must be obtained to open new
 churches.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 There are no explicit restrictions on travel within the
 country. There are restrictions on travel abroad, including
 lengthy delays in obtaining passports. Both citizens and
 residents of Equatorial Guinea must obtain exit permits,
 issued by the security police, to leave the country. Many
 Equatorial Guineans leave the country without formal
 documentation for both economic and political reasons and
 reside abroad, mostly in Spain, France, Cameroon, and Gabon.
 The Government encourages Equatorial Guineans abroad to
 return, but in 1990 few did so. In the case of Jose Primo
 Esono Mica, the Government ruled that, by adopting Spanish
 citizenship, he had lost Equatorial Guinean citizenship (see
 Section l.d.).
 There are a number of workers from other African countries in
 Equatorial Guinea. These African workers sometimes must
 resort to bribery to obtain legal registration but generally
 are free to work and travel within the country.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 The people of Equatorial Guinea do not have the right to
 change their government by democratic means. President Obiang
 was reelected in 1989 as the sole legal candidate. His
 Democratic Party of Equatorial Guinea (DPEG) is the only
 political party allowed to function. Only party members may
 be candidates in elections, and the legislature is subordinate
 to the executive with no independent authority.

 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 In 1990 the Government showed a degree of political
 sensitivity to allegations of human rights violations lodged
 by AI and others. In September President Obiang specifically
 addressed an AI report on torture in Equatorial Guinea when he
 announced formation of a commission to monitor human rights.
 The commission had not been organized by the end of 1990. The
 President invited the Secretary General or another high AI
 official to visit Equatorial Guinea.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Although the law calls for equal treatment for all, tribal
 groups are not always granted the same rights and privileges.
 The Fang tribe comprises 80 percent of the population,. the
 Bubi 15 percent, and other groups 5 percent. The Fang-clans,
 of which President Obiang is a member, dominate all aspects of
 government, the military, and social life. Discrimination
 against the Bubi, Fernandino, and Playero ethnic groups is
 consistent, whether in the granting of political office or the
 approval of academic scholarships. There are, however,
 members of minority groups in positions of prominence, e.g., a
 Bubi has held the office of Prime Minister since 1982, and a
 member of another minority is Secretary General of the ruling
 party.
 Women are confined by custom to traditional roles, especially
 in agriculture. Polygamy, which is widespread, contributes to
 the secondary status in society given to women. According to
 the Government, boys and girls are equally likely to complete
 secondary school. The Constitution and laws guarantee equal
 rights for women. There is no legal discrimination in
 employment, though women are largely excluded from some
 fields, such as the military, by tradition. The Ministry for
 the Promotion of Women focuses on agriculture, handicrafts,
 and professional training. It is interested in developing
 women's agricultural cooperatives and enrolling more women in
 the School of Professional Training in Malabo.
 According to medical doctors employed in hospitals, neither
 violence against women nor abuse of children is common. The
 Government has not addressed violence as an issue and looks to
 the Ministry for the Promotion of Women to advance the
 interests of women in Equatorial Guinean society. According
 to the medical community, female circumcision is not practiced
 in Equatorial Guinea.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Workers do not have the right of free association. In the
 small wage economy, no labor organizations exist, although
 there are a few cooperatives with limited power. Strikes are
 prohibited by law. Equatorial Guinea has been a member of the
 International Labor Organization (ILO) since 1981 but has
 ratified neither ILO convention 87 on freedom of association
 nor convention 98 on the right to organize and collective
 bargaining.

 EQUATORIAL GUINEA
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 There is no legislation regarding these rights, and no
 evidence of collective bargaining by any group. Wages are set
 by the Government and the employer with little or no input by
 the worker. The employer must meet the minimum wage set by
 the Government, and most companies pay above the government
 established minimum. There are no export processing or free
 trade zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Forced labor and slavery are prohibited by law, and netither
 is practiced.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 The legal minimum age for employment is 16, but there is no
 enforcement of this law. Children younger than 16 commonly
 assist families with agricultural production and sales.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 There is only a small industrial sector in the country. Most
 salaried employment is provided by the Government, construction
 companies, businesses providing retail goods and services, and
 the plantation agricultural sector. In 1990 the Government
 increased the statutory minimum wage rates to approximately
 $56 per month for agricultural workers and $104 per month for
 workers in nonagricultural sectors. The minimum wage law is
 not widely enforced, and government employees are exempted
 from its provisions. No reliable figures exist for average
 monthly salary of those employed in the small wage economy.
 Most of those with regular salaried employment have to
 supplement their earnings with income from other sources or by
 farming to provide a decent standard of living for their
 families. The law limits the regular.workweek to 48 hours and
 guarantees employees 1 rest day per week plus regularly
 scheduled national holidays. Occupational health and safety
 standards do not exist. There is no effective monitoring of
 work hours or labor conditions.
