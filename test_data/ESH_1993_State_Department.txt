 WESTERN SAHARA
 The sovereignty of the Western Sahara remains the subject of diplomatic dispute.
 Morocco assumed administration of the northern three provinces of the Western Sa-
 hara after the withdrawal of Spanish forces in 1975 and of the southernmost prov-
 ince of Oued ed Dahab in 1979 when Mauritania renounced its claim to the area.
 Since unifying the territory, Morocco has undertaken a massive infrastructural and
 economic development program that has resulted in substantial growth in the re-
 gion's cities.
 Since 1973 the Polisario Front, an organization which Algeria has supported and
 which seeks independence for the Western Sahara, has challenged successively the
 claims of Spain and Morocco to the territory. Moroccan and Polisario forces have
 fought intermittently since 1975, although there have been no significant clashes
 since 1991.
 At the request of the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA), the Inter-
 national Court of Justice issued an advisory opinion in 1975 regarding the status
 of the Western Sahara. The Court held that Morocco was not entitled to exercise
 sovereignty over the territory. Rather, according to the Court, the people of the
 Western Sahara were entitled to self-determination. Morocco agreed in principle in
 1981 to hold a referendum to determine the wishes of the population of the Western
 Sahara. Efforts by the Organization of African Unity (OAU) to resolve the sov-
 ereignty question collapsed in 1984 when the Saharan Arab Democratic Republic
 (SADR), the civilian arm of the Polisario, was recognized at an OAU summit,
 prompting Morocco to withdraw from the OAU in protest.
 In 1986 Morocco asked the United Nations to administer a referendum, and it has
 attempted to do so since that time. In 1987 a U.N. technical team visited the terri-
 tory in order to determine the practical arrangements necessary for a referendum.
 On August 30, 1988, Morocco and the SADR accepted in principle the Secretary
 General's proposal for a referendum under U.N. and OAU auspices, and the Sec-
 retary General named a special representative to work out the details.
 In 1991 the Secretary Gneral presented a plan for a referendum in the Western
 Sahara in which the Sahrawis (Western Sahara natives) would decide between inte-
 gration with Morocco and independence. The plan called for a cease-fire supervised
 ya U.N. Monitoring Force (MINURSO) to be followed within 20 weeks by a ref-
 erendum. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) was to as-
 sist Sahrawi refugees living in A geria to voluntarily repatriate to the Western Sa-
 hara. The 1974 Spanish census of the region was to serve as the basis for the voting
 list. Morocco challenged the accuracy and completeness of the list and presented to
 the United Nations a supplemental list containing more than 120,000 additional
 names.
 On September 6, 1991, the cease-fire went into effect and initial MINURSO forces
 were deployed. Simultaneously, the UNHCR sent an international team to assist
 with the repatriation of Sahrawi refugees. The referendum, originally scheduled to
 take place in January 1992, was postponed pending attempts to resolve the conten-
 tious voter identification issue. The outgoing Secretary General thereupon proposed
 five voter eligibility criteria to the U.N. Security Council. The Security Council
 passed a resolution welcoming the proposal without endorsing it, and subsequent
 U.N. efforts have focused upon obtaining agreement by the parties to the criteria
 and their application.

 In June 1993 the U.N. Secretary General proposed a compromise which would
 make more riorous the documentation needed for a person to establish the resi.
 dence or heredity required to qualify for voter eligibility under the earlier proposal.
 Neither the Moroccans nor the Polisario rejected the proposed compromise out of
 hand. Direct talks took place between the two sides in the city of Laayounne during
 July but no agreement was reached. The Moroccan Government favors broad-based
 criteria for the referendum which would include many whom they claim left the
 Western Sahara prior to being counted in the 1974 Spanish census or were born
 after 1974 to those qualified under the census. Claiming the risk of fraud, the
 Polisario favors more narrow criteria focused on those enumerated as in the terri-
 tory during the 1974 census. In his report to the United Nations Security Council
 of November 24, 1993, the Secretary General stated that "while expressing reserva-
 tions about the provisions relating to tribal links with the territory, Morocco acqui-
 esced in the compromise." The Polisario is described by the Secretary General in
 that same report as having'. . . maintained its substantial reservations and pro-
 posals for amendments. . . of the compromise.
 Since 1977 the northern provinces o Laayoune, Smara, and Boujdour have par-
 ticipated in Moroccan elections. The southernmost province of Oued ed Dahab has
 also participated in the elections since 1983. Sahrawis fill all 10 of the seats allotted
 to the Western Sahara in the new Parliament. Three of the four governors of the
 regon, who are appointed by the King of Morocco, are Sahrawis.
 The civilian population in the approximately 85 percent of the Western Sahara
 under Moroccan control is subject to Moroccan law. U.N. observers and foreign
 human rights groups have reported that Sahrawis supportive of the Polisario Front
 often have more difficulty obtaining passports, that their political views are more
 closely monitored than those of residents of Morocco proper, and that they are more
 likely to be treated harshly by police and paramilitary authorities.
 A number of Sahrawis who have returned to Morocco from Polisario camps near
 Tindouf, Algeria have complained that they and other Sahrawi's were tortured and
 mistreated in the camps. Other non-Sahrawi observers who have visited the camps
 say, however that they have found no evidence of torture. Ibrahim Hakim, a former
 Polisario earlier who has defected to Morocco, alleges first-hand knowledge of such
 mistreatment. The Government of Morocco's Consultative Council on Human Rights
 established a working group to investigate onging allegations of Polisario mis-
 conduct in the Tinduf camps. For its part, the olisario claims that the Moroccans
 have tortured suspected Polsario supporters.
 After years of denying that Sahrawis were imprisoned in Morocco for Polisario-
 related military or political activity, the Government of Morocco released 300 such
 prisoners in 1991. Among those released were entire families and Sahrawis who had
 'disappeared" in the mid-1970's. The Moroccan Government has failed to conduct
 a public inquiry or to explain how and why these persons were held for up to 16
 years in incommunicado detention without charge or trial. The Polisario claims that
 Morocco continues to hold more than 800 Sahrawis as political prisoners. The Gov-
 ernment of Morocco formally denies that any Sahrawi noncombatants remain in Mo-
 roccan detention. Amnesty International expressed concern, however, that hundreds
 of Sahrawis arrested by Moroccan security forces between 1975 and 1988 remain
 "disappeared." Credible sources estimate that 68 Sahrawis remain in detention in
 Morocco and that between 2 500 and 3,000 Moroccan prisoners are being held by
 the Polisario near Tindouf. The Polisario has said it is prepared to release 200 Mo-
 rccan Dprisoners unconditionally, but Morocco, believing that the offer is predicated
 upon its according Polisario greater legitimacy, has declined to take up the matter
 directly with the Polisaio Front.
 The 1UNHCR, using figures provided by the Government of Algeria, estimates that
 approximately 165,000 refugees reside in camps near Tindouf, Algeria. Sahrawis re-
 cently returned to Morocco from the camps estimate, however, that no more than
 80,000 refugees inhabit the camps. They believe that 40,000 to 50,000 of those are
 Sahrawis, the remainder coming from other countries in the region. The Govern-
 ment of Morocco alleges that the Sahrawis are held in the Tindouf camps against
 their will. The Polisano denies this allegation.
 Freedom of movement within the Western Sahara is limited in militarily sensitive
 areas. While travel is nominally unrestricted elsewhere, travelers inside and outside
 the cities are reportedly subjected to arbitrary questioning, detainment, and, at
 times, abuse by the security forces.
 The same labor laws that apply in Morocco apply in the Moroccan-controlled areas
 of the Western Sahara, and enforement is equivalent to that in Morocco proper.
 Within the Western Sahara there is little organized labor activity. Since salaries in
 both the private and public sectors are significantly higher than those in Morocco,
 wage demands are not an issue. Unemployment has also not been a problem be-

 cause of the Government's investment in the region and a program of bringing
 young people voluntarily out of the region to work in Morocco. Outside the territory
 controledby Morocco the Polisario established a labor wing called the Sario Fed-
 eration of Labor (UGFSARIO), which in the past reportedly enjoyed close relations
 with a few Arab and African national labor centers. The UGTSARIO does not en-
 gage in customary trade union activities in the Polisario-controlled areas.
