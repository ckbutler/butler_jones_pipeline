 AUSTRALIA
 Australia has a long history as a multiparty, parliamentary
 democracy operating within a federal system of government.
 Federal elections, last held in July 1987, must be held again
 no later than November 21, 1990.
 Federal, state, and local police in Australia carry out their
 functions in accordance with civil law, which respects and
 safeguards individual human rights. The law is observed in
 practice.
 Australia's developed economy, with important mining and
 agricultural sectors and growing manufacturing and service
 sectors, provides most Australians with a high per capita
 income. Furthermore, the Government provides assistance for
 the minority of relatively disadvantaged citizens.
 Individuals are free to hold private property, pursue their
 economic and personal interests, associate with others, and
 organize trade unions.
 Fundamental human rights are assured by law and respected in
 practice in Australia. The Government's commitment to the
 promotion of, and respect for, human rights is firm,
 domestically and internationally. During 1989 protection of
 the rights of Australia's 200,000 Aboriginals, the most
 economically and socially disadvantaged minority in the
 country, continued to receive significant government and
 public attention. Also in 1989, a Royal Commission continued
 investigation of deaths of Aboriginals in police custody, a
 precedent-setting federal-state agreement resolved a
 long-running land rights dispute, and a national council
 system to give Aboriginal communities a more direct voice in
 federal government neared enactment. Women's rights continued
 to receive attention under the Federal Government's national
 agenda for women, which includes a nationwide campaign to
 reduce domestic violence.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 Killing for political motives by the Government or by
 political organizations does not occur.
 b. Disappearance
 There have been no instances of political disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Australian law prohibits all these practices, and this
 prohibition is generally respected. However, concerns over
 deaths in custody of Aboriginals continue to be addressed by
 the Government.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Australian law prohibits arbitrary arrest and imprisonment.
 This prohibition is respected in practice.
 With regard to forced or compulsory labor, see Section 6.c.

 AUSTRALIA
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Australian law provides for the right to a fair public trial
 before an independent judiciary. -Defendants have full due
 process rights including a presumption of innocence, an
 unimpeded right of counsel (at public expense for indigents),
 a right to confront witnesses, and a-right to appeal. These
 rights are respected in practice.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Under Australian law and in practice, no search may be
 conducted without a judicial warrant. The Government does not
 interfere with the privacy of family, home, or correspondence.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The democratic political system, an effective judiciary, and
 diverse and independent news media combine to ensure freedom
 of speech and press and full academic freedom.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Although Australia does not have a bill of rights, it is a
 party to the Intdrnational Covenant on Civil and Political
 Rights, which provides for freedom of assembly and
 expression. These freedoms are respected in practice.
 For a discussion of freedom of association as it applies to
 labor unions, see Section 6.a.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Australians have complete freedom of religion. A provision in
 the Constitution precludes the adopti6n of an official state
 religion.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Australia imposes'no restrictions on movement within or
 outside of the country. The rights of emigration and
 repatriation are also protected.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Australians elect representatives to a two-chamber Federal
 Parliament as well as to numerous state and local bodies
 through free and open elections. Candidates are drawn from
 three major parties and a number of minor parties. Voting, by
 secret ballot, is compulsory in general elections for
 Australians 18 years of age and older; eligible voters who do
 not vote may be fined. Elections are held at varying
 intervals as prescribed by federal, state, and local laws.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding Internation~l and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 As a matter of policy, the Government responds to any
 communication from the United Nations alleging violations of
 
 
 771
 AUSTRALIA
 human rights in Australia. The Government also permits
 unimpeded access to all international and nongovernmental
 groups investigating alleged human rights violations.
 On the international level, Australia actively promotes human
 rights as a member of the U.N. Working Group on Indigenous
 Populations and in other forums.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 By law, Australians have equal access to government services
 without reference to race, sex, teligion, language, or social
 status. Basic food, shelter, health care, education, and
 social security benefits are guaranteed for all. The Racial
 Discrimination Act of 1975 prohibits discrimination on grounds
 of race, color, descent, or national or ethnic origin.
 A national multicultural agenda, announced by the Federal
 Government in July 1989, launched a 3-year education campaign
 to improve intercultural understanding and committed the
 Government to additional federal legislation if existing state
 laws were found to address inadequately the concerns of ethnic
 and racial groups. The following month, the Federal Human
 Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission began a special review
 of the causes of racial unrest and incidents of alleged
 "racist violence". However, Aboriginal groups and others
 claim that Aboriginals, who comprise about 1.25 percent of the
 nation's population, suffer widespread discrimination. The
 Government acknowledges that the Aboriginal population is the
 most disadvantaged group in terms of education, housing,
 health, and 4mployment. In addition to the broad range of
 programs available to all Australians, the Government provides
 services specifically aimed at improving Aboriginal
 socioeconomic conditions.
 A Royal Commission created in 1987 to investigate Aboriginal
 deaths in police custody continued to review cases and take
 testimony in 1989. The Commission's mandate was extended
 until December 1990, but its findings will be based primarily
 on an examination of the over 100 deaths in custody which
 occurred between January 1, 1980 and May 31, 1989. Interim
 social, legal, and law enforcement reforms recommended by the
 Commission were endorsed by national police officials and
 Aboriginal leaders in February 1989. Although many of these
 reforms were implemented by state and local governments,
 deaths in custody continued.
 An agreement reached by the Federal and the Northern Territory
 Governments in September 1989 recognized a limited number of
 Aboriginal groups' land claims in exchange for their
 acceptance of a land rights appeals process through the
 Northern Territory court system. The agreement gave the 3,000
 to 5,000 Aboriginal squatters in the disputed areas legal
 status and allowed them to qualify for federally funded
 community services.
 The Federal Senate took up consideration of a controversial
 plan to replace the Federal Department of Aboriginal Affairs
 with the Aboriginal and Torres Straits Islander Commission
 (ATSIC), comprised of commissioners elected from the
 Aboriginal councils around the country. Supporters of the
 ATSIC maintain that it would give Aboriginals a greater voice
 in issues affecting them. The Federal Government is publicly
 
 
 772
 AUSTRALIA
 committed to a more formal delineation of Aboriginal rights
 than currently exists.
 Government at all levels and the Australian public place
 considerable emphasis on women's issues, including violence
 against women.  There is growing concern about domestic
 violence, the victims of which are mostly female. It is
 difficult to measure the extent of domestic violence due to
 the lack of reliable statistics and the reluctance of victims
 to report incidents. However, a widely quoted April 1989
 study by the Australian Institute of Criminology estimated
 that betwen 1 in 3 and 1 in 10 families, from all
 socioeconomic backgrounds, may be affected.
 In response to public concerns, the Government began a 3-year
 national domestic violence education campaign in 1987 which
 included a hationwide awareness month in 1989. In
 coordination with women's rights groups, law enforcement
 authorities, and state and local governments, the campaign has
 led to victim protection legislation, improved police training
 and tactics, and increased sensitivity to domestic violence on
 the part of community service agencies., Women's and legal
 rights groups generally agree that these efforts have raised
 community awareness, but that additional governmental,
 resources are needed to reduce the incidence of domestic
 violence.
 The Sex Discrimination Act of 1984 prohibits discrimination on
 the basis of sex, marital status, or pregnancy. In 1986 the
 Government passed affirmative action legislation obliging
 employers to provide equal employment and promotion
 opportunities for women employees. Women's rights and welfare
 are promoted by a number o  women's rights groups and the
 Federal Government's Office of the Status of Women.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Australian law and practice provide workers with full freedom
 to establish and join trade unions, choose their union
 representatives, and formulate union programs. These rights
 of association include the right of Australian unions to
 associate directly with their counterparts in other nations
 and to participate in international labor organizations.
 Unions represent about 40 percent of the work force and are
 extremely active and influential. Australian workers enjoy
 the right to strike, which is well established in practice.
 However, a 1989 ruling of the Victoria Supreme Court declaring
 the airline pilots union liable for damages arising from the
 pilots, dispute with the airlines underscored that the right
 to strike is not protected under domestic law.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 Australian Workers are granted the right, by law and in
 practice, to organize and bargain collectively and to be
 represented in negotiating the prevention and settlement of
 disputes, with employers. A pattern of centralized wage
 negotiations with quasi-judicial arbitration and settlement,
 as oposed to company-by-company collective bargaining, has
 generally prevailed since the establishment of the
 Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Commission in 1904.
 The Industrial Relations Act of 1988 made important technical
 changes in the basic system, creating a new Industrial
 
 
 773
 AUSTRALIA
 Relations Commission with expanded scope for performing
 essentially the same tasks as its predecessor.
 Industrial disputes are arbitrated by a system of federal and
 state industrial courts in which trade unions receive a full
 and fair hearing. The rights of trade union officials are
 fully protected in both law and practice.
 Federal labor law ard practice are uniform throughout the
 country. There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Austxalia has ratified and fully respects International Labor
 Organization (ILO) Convention 105 concerning forced labor.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 Australia has ratified and fully respects the following ILO
 conventions concerning minimum age for employment: Convention
 7 (minimum age); Convention 10 (minimum age for agricultural
 workers); Convention 15 (minimum age for trimmers and
 stokers); Convention 112 (minimum age for fishermen); and
 Convention 123 (minimum age for underground workers). In
 addition, federal and state ministries of labor monitor and
 enforce a network of legislation (which often varies from
 state to state) governing such interactive factors as minimum
 school-leaving age, minimum age to claim unemployment
 benefits, and minimum age to engage in specified occupations.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 Australia has long had a tradition that workers should be
 guaranteed a decent standard of living. Although Australia
 has a formal federal minimum wage of $156 per week, the
 federal minimum wage is rarely, if ever, used. Instead,
 different minimum wage rates for individual trades and
 professions are embodied in a comprehensive system of "awards"
 sanctioned by various state and federal commissions. The
 lowest current award of $217 per week is for clothing
 workers. Combined with other regularly provided benefits and
 government entitlements for low-income families, this wage
 provides a decent standard of living.
 In addition, a body of regulations and commission decisions
 prescribes the 40-hour (often 38-hour) week, paid vacations
 and sick leave, and health and safety standards in the
 workplace, as well as other benefits for the overwhelming
 majority of Australian workers. Compliance with these and
 other regulations, such as minimum age of employment, is
 actively monitored and enforced by federal and state
 ministries of labor.
