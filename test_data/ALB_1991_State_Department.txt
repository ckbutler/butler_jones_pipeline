 ALBANIA*
 Albania experienced profound political change in 1991, moving
 from a one-party Marxist-Leninist dictatorship under Ramiz Alia
 toward a multiparty parliamentary form of government with
 constitutional protection of human rights. In March, in
 multiparty legislative elections flawed by harassment and
 intimidation of opposition candidates, newly formed opposition
 parties won approximately one-third of the seats in the 250-
 member People's Assembly; leading officials of the ruling
 Albanian Party of Labor (APL) were defeated in several
 contests. An APL government formed in February under Prime
 Minister Fatos Nano continued in office for a short time
 following the elections, and the People's Assembly elected
 Alia, the incumbent President and head of the APL, to a new
 presidential term on April 30. However, a general strike
 called by the Federation of Independent Trade Unions to protest
 worsening economic conditions and the postelection killings of
 opposition demonstrators in Shkoder led to the resignation of
 the Nano government in early June. On June 12, the People's
 Assembly approved a Government of National Stability led by
 Prime Minister Ylli Bufi of the Socialist Party of Albania
 (formerly the APL), but 12 of 24 Cabinet seats went to members
 of the opposition parties. However, in early December the two
 leading opposition parties withdrew from the Bufi Government,
 asserting that the Socialist Party was blocking further reform.
 Bufi then resigned, and on December 10 Alia appointed Vilson
 Ahmeti to form an interim nonparty government to administer the
 country until new elections are held. On December 21, Alia
 proposed March 1, 1992, as the date for these elections.
 The Bufi Government took some initial measures to reform the
 secret police (Sigurimi), the organization charged with
 enforcing the repressive controls that guaranteed the APL a
 monopoly on power and severely limited the rights and freedoms
 of Albanian citizens. Prior to and immediately following the
 March elections, the security forces, including the army and
 the police, used deadly force against unarmed opposition
 demonstrators on several occasions. Deadly force was also used
 to control crowds of would-be emigrants in March though not in
 August; in later incidents the army was able to maintain order
 without the use of firearms. However, according to the report
 of the Rapporteur Mission of the Conference on Security and
 Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) which visited Albania in September,
 the staff of the new National Intelligence Service is composed
 entirely of former Sigurimi members. A July law subjected the
 National Intelligence Service to democratic civilian control,
 but in October the Government conceded that the process of
 dismissing personnel guilty of abuses under the Marxist-
 Leninist dictatorship had not been completed.
 In 1991 Albania began to implement a reform program intended to
 establish a market-oriented economy. Most prices were freed,
 and the national currency was devalued to more realistic levels.
 Significant progress was made in the privatization of
 agricultural land and the establishment of small-scale private
 enterprises. The legal foundation was laid for the
 * U.S. diplomatic relations were reestablished with Albania on
 March 15, 1991, after a 35-year break, and the U.S. Embassy
 opened in Tirana on October 1, 1991.

 privatization of some large state enterprises as well. However,
 living standards, already the lowest in Europe, declined due to
 disruptions in food production and distribution, and shortages
 were common in the cities.
 Albania's human rights performance improved notably in 1991.
 The Law on Major Constitutional Provisions, passed on April 30,
 provides for internationally recognized human rights, including
 the rights of ethnic minorities. Significant progress occurred,
 both in law and in practice, in the areas of freedom of speech,
 press, religion, and travel. All political prisoners were
 released by June. An Albanian human rights organization, the
 Human Rights Forum, was established and assumed an active
 monitoring and advocacy role. Workers obtained the right to
 associate freely, to organize, and to strike, and formed strong
 independent unions. However, the legal system has not yet been
 overhauled, and the legislature has not yet adopted a new
 constitution.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 There were no reports of targeted political killings in 1991,
 but there were a number of instances of the use of excessive
 force by police and military personnel. On February 23, APL
 sympathizers demonstrated for restoration of APL founder Enver
 Hoxha's statue, which had been toppled, and at least three
 unarmed counterdemonstrators were killed by fire from army
 personnel. On April 2, 4 members of the opposition Albanian
 Democratic Party were killed by gunfire as they were trying to
 calm an estimated 30,000 demonstrators who had gathered in front
 of local APL headquarters in the northern town of Shkoder to
 protest alleged fraud during the March elections. Nearly 60
 were wounded by the gunfire, which came from the APL building.
 A commission of the People's Assembly, formed to investigate the
 Shkoder incident, held the security forces responsible. The
 chief of the Shkoder police and three assistants were arrested.
 However, the trial was suspended in mid-November, and the case
 was returned to the investigative authorities for further
 review. A date for the resumption of the trial has yet to be
 set.
 According to credible Western observers, the authorities used
 deadly force on several occasions in March in efforts to control
 groups of would-be emigrants. On March 9, 4 persons were
 reported killed and 10 wounded when security forces seized a
 ship in Durres which had been commandeered by would-be emigrants
 seeking to flee the country. On March 23, border guards
 reportedly fired into a group fleeing into Yugoslavia, killing
 one and wounding several. On March 25, 1 person was reported
 killed and some 29 wounded by security forces attempting to
 control a crowd which had stormed the harbor area of Durres in
 search of ships to transport them out of Albania. However, the
 authorities refrained from using deadly force to control would-be
 emigrants in later incidents, including the massive August exodus
 to Italy and Malta. In early December, the Army was called out
 to assist the police in controlling groups seeking to seize food
 supplies from stores and warehouses. According to Western
 observers and press reports, several looters and one soldier
 died in various incidents throughout the country.
 
 
 1044
 ALBANIA
 b. Disappearance
 There-were no reported disappearances in 1991.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 The criminal code prohibits the use of physical or psychological
 force during investigations and provides penalties for those
 found guilty of such abuse. The prohibition on the use of force
 appears to have been respected since the March elections.
 Many political prisoners freed in 1991 recounted that they had
 suffered beatings during interrogation and extremely harsh prison
 conditions afterward, including a severe hard-labor regime,
 inadequate food and clothing, long-term solitary confinement,
 and cramped and unheated cells. Although these accounts dealt
 with events that took place before 1991, none of those guilty of
 abusing prisoners has yet been charged or tried.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Arbitrary arrest and detention are no longer common practices,
 and procedural safeguards are being erected to prevent their
 recurrence. The Law on Major Constitutional Provisions makes
 the strict and equal application of juridical norms compulsory.
 Although these norms are not clearly defined and may not be
 until a new constitution is adopted, the draft constitution
 proposed by the APL on April 10 would prohibit arbitrary arrests
 and imprisonment without a court verdict and provides for a
 3-day time limit on detention without charge, the right of
 immediate appeal to the courts in cases of detention, the right
 to be defended by an attorney, and the presumption of innocence.
 In the period prior to the March elections, opposition party
 leaders reported that at least 200 opposition activists had been
 arrested and briefly detained and that some of them were beaten.
 During the general strike which brought down the Nano government,
 union leaders were briefly detained on several occasions. Since
 the formation of the National Stability Government, however,
 there have been no reports of arbitrary arrests or detentions.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The judicial system, which includes the Supreme Court and
 regional and district courts, is being depoliticized and is
 moving toward independence. In 1990 the Ministry of Justice was
 reestablished and given a mandate to supervise the process of
 reform. The People's Assembly elected a new Supreme Court and a
 new Attorney General in May 1991; and the Minister of Justice in
 the Bufi Government was chosen by the opposition Social
 Democratic Party. The Law on Major Constitutional Provisions
 declares Albania to be a state "based on the rule of law,"
 provides for the separation of powers and an independent
 judiciary guided "solely by law," and mandates depoliticization
 of the courts and the entire legal system. Candidates for the
 lower courts are proposed by the Minister of Justice and approved
 by the President. According to law, they may not be transferred
 or dimissed for political reasons.
 In May 1990, the People's Assembly amended the penal code to
 provide for the right to be defended by an attorney, the right
 to a speedy trial, and the right to appeal a case. The process
 of restructuring the legal system is not complete. The private
 practice of law, prohibited since 1967, was authorized in
 
 
 1045
 
 ALBANIA
 November 1990. As of March 1991, Albanian lawyers had identified
 several serious problems with the legal system as it currently
 operates. 'For example, a defense attorney may not see a
 defendant without the investigating judge being present-
 (however, neither may a judge see a defendant without ehe
 presence of a defense attorney). Convicted prisoners do not
 receive a copy of their judgment of conviction and sentencing;
 although a lawyer may see the judgment, he or she is barred from
 showing it to the client without permission of the court.
 All political prisoners were freed by the summer of 1991, and
 their families released from the internal exile to which they
 had frequently been subjected. In May the Association of Former
 Political Prisoners and Internees was formed to seek compensation
 for the injustices political prisoners had suffered in the past.
 On September 20, approximately 100 members of the Association
 went on a hunger strike and succeeded in forcing the Government
 to concede to their demands. The Government pledged to pay a
 monthly allowance to all former political prisoners who were
 unemployed and to provide them with employment and housing on a
 priority basis; and on September 29 the People's Assembly passed
 a law which declared those previously convicted of political
 crimes to be innocent and to be considered as never having been
 convicted.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Law on Major Constitutional Provisions is silent on the
 issue of arbitrary interference with privacy, family, home,- or
 correspondence, although it states that Albania "guarantees the
 human rights and fundamental freedoms of the individual... (as)
 accepted by international documents." Warrants issued by the
 Attorney General or the district attorneys are required for
 searches, and in practice cases of arbitrary interference with
 privacy, family, home, and correspondence became the exception
 rather than the rule in 1991. Nevertheless, there were credible
 allegations that the National Intelligence Service continued to
 conduct politically motivated surveillance operations against
 some political figures even after the-formation of the Government
 of National Stability in June; and there were widespread
 suspicions of surreptitious wiretapping and interception of
 correspondence.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Law on Major Constitutional Provisions does not specifically
 address freedom of speech.. In practice, freedom of speech,
 including criticism of the Government and government officials,
 is respected. Albanians now openly discuss the issues of the
 day among themselves'and with Western visitors. However, the
 continuing activities of the security services are a limiting
 factor in that some individuals still fear reprisals for
 expressing critical opinions.
 Opposition parties, the independent trade unions, and various
 citizens' groups have been allowed to publish their own
 newspapers since January. These publications often contain
 harsh attacks on government policies and officials and do not
 appear to practice self-censorship of any kind.
 Nevertheless, the editors and staff of opposition papers allege
 that the state-controlled publishing and distribution.system
 
 
 1046
 ALBANIA
 discriminates against their publications, and several claim that
 they have received death threats both in writing and by
 telephone. The brother of one editor, who is also a Member of
 Parliament, reportedly was severely beaten and told specifically
 that it was because of the editor's opposition activity. Dr.
 Elez Biberaj, head of Voice of America's Albanian Service, was
 injured while on a visit to Albania in September when the car in
 which he was traveling with several Albanian journalists was
 struck several times by another vehicle. Following a
 preliminary investigation, the Government concluded that the
 incident was a simple traffic accident and placed the alleged
 perpetrator under arrest. However, the opposition Democratic
 Party has publicly stated its view that members of the Sigurimi
 were responsible for the incident.
 Radio.and television remain state monopolies. Following
 credible charges that broadcasts prior to the March elections
 unduly favored the APL, the newly elected People's Assembly
 placed Albanian radio and television directly under its own
 jurisdiction. On November 24, Albanian radio and television
 were placed by law under the control of a nonpartisan managing
 council charged with ensuring that the media do not serve the
 interest of any party and that broadcasts are impartial and
 objective.
 Albania's major university, the University of Tirana, was closed
 in March by the Minister of Education following a series of anti-
 APL student demonstrations in February pressing for further
 reforms. It reopened on October 1 in a new atmosphere of greater
 academic freedom, and the curriculum is being revised.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Law on Major Constitutional Provisions guarantees political
 pluralism and provides that political parties be fully separated
 from state institutions, including the military and security
 services. The draft constitution proposed by the APL would
 guarantee citizens "freedom to assemble.. .according to the
 conditions defined by law" but does not specify these conditions.
 In practice, the authorities have demonstrated growing respect
 for freedom of assembly, particularly in the period after the
 formation of the Government of National Stability. Prior to
 June, opposition party rallies and demonstrations were frequently
 disrupted, often violently, by state security forces. On March
 1, all demonstrations not related to the elections were banned.
 On May 29, police used water cannon to break up a peaceful
 demonstration in Tirana in support of the general strike called
 by the Federation of Independent Trade Unions. After June,
 police permission for public gatherings, a legal requirement,
 was generally granted, and opposition assemblies were held
 without disruption. A September 14 rally called by several
 opposition parties, the unions, and the Association of Former
 Political Prisoners attracted 50,000 participants and took place
 without incident. On October 6, the Democratic Party held a
 rally without police permission. The authorities allowed the
 rally to take place but warned that in the future organizers of
 illegal rallies would be prosecuted.
 Freedom of association is largely respected. New political
 parties must be approved by the Ministry of Justice according to
 the law on the formation of political parties passed by the
 People's Assembly, but numerous parties representing widely
 divergent views have received such-approval. However, that law
 appears to prohibit the formation of parties based on ethnic-
 
 
 1047
 ALBANIA
 considerations, a cause of concern to the Omonia Party, which
 represents Albania's Greek minority. Independent nonpolitical
 organizations of various kinds, including trade unions, human
 rights groups, and cultural and civic organizations, were
 established in 1991 and'functioned freely.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Freedom of religion has been established in both theory and
 practice. The Government legalized the private practice of
 religion in May 1990 and public practice in December 1990. The
 Law on Major Constitutional Provisions declares Albania to be "a
 secular state" which "respects the freedom of religious faith
 and creates conditions to exercise it."
 There were no reports in 1991 of governmental obstruction of tbe"
 practice of religion. Numerous mosques and churches reopened
 throughout the country. Delegations and missions from the
 Vatican, the Orthodox Ecumenical Patriarchate, and the Muslim
 World League visited Albania in 1991; and diplomatic relations
 with the Vatican were resumed after a break of 46 years.
 However, due to the years of repression prior to 1990, there are
 few clergy of any denomination left in the country, and
 questions concerning property confiscated from religious
 organizations remain unresolved.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 There are no longer any restrictions on freedom of movement
 within the country, and regulations on foreign travel and
 emigration have been revised. The Passport Law of May 1990 made
 passports available to all citizens, and the practice of
 limiting passports to specific countries of destination was
 abandoned in 1991. Under legislation that went into effect on
 July 27, exit visas are no longer required for travel abroad,
 except in the case of minors under the age of 16..
 During 1991'thousands of Albanian would-be emigrants sought to
 leave the country by seizing vessels in Albanian ports and
 forcing-them to sail to Italy or Malta. Mass-departures took
 place in March and August. Most Western observers, including
 officials of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR),
 believe that the vast majority-of these would-be emigrants were
 motivated by economic considerations. A joint UNHCR-
 International Organization of Migration mission which visited
 Albania in August concluded that the only way to prevent the
 recurrence of mass departures was the inauguration of emergency
 relief measures by foreign donors, followed by long-term
 development'assistance to revitalize the economy.
 Almost all would-be emigrants who actually arrived in Italy and
 Malta in August were repatriated to Albania following interviews
 with UNHCR officals to determine their eligibility for asylum.
 The Government of Albania provided assurances that none of these
 returnees would be prosecuted or suffer reprisals of any kind;
 and according to Western observers, including UNHCR and U.S.
 government officials, there have in fact been no prosecutions or
 reprisals.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 The Law on Major Constitutional Provisions changed the country's
 title from Socialist People's Republic of Albania to Republic of
 
 
 1048
 ALBANIA
 Albania and provides citizens with the right to change their
 government "by free, general, equal, direct, and secret ballot."
 Under this law, voters directly elect members of the legislature,
 the People's Assembly, which elects the President. In 1991 the
 People's Assembly also elected the members of the Supreme Court.
 The people's effort to exercise the right to change their
 government in the March 31 legislative elections, the first
 multiparty elections in Albania since 1945, was hindered by
 government interference. While observers concluded that the
 casting and counting of votes was generally fair, the campaign
 leading up to the elections was marred by acts of intimidation
 against opposition candidates and serious inequities in the
 Government's treatment of opposition parties. The ruling APL
 enjoyed an overwhelming advantage in access to government-
 controlled broadcast media, although the opposition parties were
 allotted some time for televised political broadcasts. The APL
 also enjoyed advantages in access to newsprint, transportation,
 and office facilities. There were credible reports of widespread
 intimidation of opposition party candidates and activists and
 the creation of an atmosphere of fear in many districts. In
 several cases, opposition speakers and activists were reportedly
 beaten or stoned.
 The APL won 169 of the 250 People's Assembly seats, and 1 went
 to the Committee of Veterans, an organization tied to the APL.
 The opposition Democratic Party won 75 seats, while 5 went to
 Omonia, a group representing the interests of the Greek minority.
 Voter turnout was over 98 percent. On April 30, the new Assembly
 elected Ramiz Alia, the incumbent President, to a new 4-year
 term.
 On May 3, Alia directed Fatos Nano, the incumbent Prime Minister,
 to form a new government. The Democratic Party rejected Nano's
 proposed coalition government, and an all-APL government was
 formed. As the result of a general strike called-by the
 Federation of Independent Trade Unions to protest worsening
 economic conditions and the Shkoder killings, the Nano government
 resigned in early June. On June 5, President Alia appointed
 Ylli Bufi Prime Minister of the coalition Government of National
 Stability. Bufi was a member of the Socialist Party (formerly
 the APL); one of two Deputy Prime Ministers was a member of the
 Democratic Party; and cabinet positions were split evenly between
 Socialist party and opposition representatives.
 In early December, the Democratic Party and the smaller
 Republican Party withdrew from the Government of National
 Stability, asserting that the Socialist Party was blocking
 further reform and calling for new elections within the next
 several months. Bufi then resigned and on December 10 Alia
 appointed Vilson Ahmeti, formerly Minister of Food in the
 National Stability Government, to form an interim government
 composed of "intellectuals" not formally affiliated with any
 party. According to a statement issued by the President's
 office announcing the appointment, the mandate of the Ahmeti
 Government is to ensure the food supply and maintain public
 order while preparing for new elections. On December 21, Alia
 proposed March 1, 1992, as the date for these elections.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 In 1991 the Government recognized Albania's first domestic human
 rights organization, the Forum for the Defense of Human Rights
 
 
 1049
 ALBANIA
 and Fundamental Freedoms. The"Forum, which has established
 branhes 'in several Albanian towns, has taken an active and
 public role in defending human rights, particularly those of
 former political-prisoners.
 The 'Government in 1991 reversed previous policy and permitted
 visits by several international and nongovernmental human rights
 organizations. These included a delegation from the
 International Helsinki Federation for Human Rights in March,
 which met with government officials and members of opposition
 parties, toured several prison and labor camps, conducted
 interviews with persons convicted of political and common
 crimes, and investigated several killings attributed to the
 security forces. .0n June 19, Albania was admitted to the CSCE;
 on September 16, President Alia signed the Helsinki Final Act;
 and on that'date Albania received a CSCE factfinding mission.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language,.or Social Status
 Greeks form the largest ethnic minority in Albania, but there
 are also small-numbers of Serbs, Macedonians, Vlachs, and
 Gypsies. Estimates of the:size of the Greek minority vary from
 59,000 (from'anofficial Albanian census) to as high as 400,000
 (from groups promoting the. interests of ethnic Greeks in
 Albania).
 The Law on Major Constitutional Provisions provides for "the
 human rights and fundamental freedoms.. .of national minorities,
 (as) accepted by international documents." The draft
 constitution proposed by the APL would gurarantee national
 minorities the right "to freely express, preserve, and develop
 their ethnic, cultural, or religious identity, to use their
 mother tongue'and to teach it in school and to develop their
 culture in all its aspects." In practice, there are limitations
 on the extent to which minorities may exercise these rights.
 Members of the Greek minority may receive schooling in their
 mother tongue during the first 4 years of primary'school only in
 those areas of the southern part of Albania where the Greek
 minority is-concentrated. Tirana radio broadcasts Greek-
 language programs periodicaljy and a Greek-language newspaper,
 Liko Vima, is published in the southern town of Gjirokaster.
 In 1991 a political party, the Democratic Union of, the Greek
 Minority (Omonia), was formed to represent the interests of the
 Greek community, and the Government accorded it legal status.
 During the legislative election campaign, Omonia contested six
 races and won five seats in the People's Assembly. However, a
 law passed following the establishment of the Government of
 National Stability in June-appears to bar the formation of
 parties based on ethnicity. It is not clear what effect this
 law will-have on the ability of Omonia to contest the next
 elections or whether Omonia intends to challenge the law before
 the Supreme Court.
 The Gypsy population in Albania is small. Popular attitudes
 toward Gypsies are negative, but they do not suffer from any
 overt forms of discrimination.
 The Law on, Major Constitutional Provisions is silent on the
 subject of women's rights. The draft constitution proposed by
 the APL prohibits discrimination based on gender and guarantees
 women equal rights "in regard to work, compensation, holidays,
 social security, education, in all sociopolitical activity, as
 well as in the family." However, Albanian law has long provided
 
 
 1050
 ALBANIA
 for equal pay for equal work and the right of women to equal
 access to education, employment, and elective office. According
 to reliable observers, approximately 50 percent of students at
 the University of Tirana are women, and women hold key economic
 positions in urban areas. No information is available on the
 extent of violence against women or government efforts to reduce
 it.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 In 1991 workers obtained the right to associate freely and
 proceeded to form trade unions of their own choosing. On
 January 17, the Government issued a decree on the right to
 strike and 2 days later authorized the formation of trade unions
 independent of the APL-linked United Trade Unions of Albania.
 On March 11, the Ministry of Justice approved the formation of
 the Federation of Independent Trade Unions (BSPSh), Such
 approval--a legal requirement for the establishment of unions
 and union federations--is routinely granted if a union's program
 is in accord with the Law on Major Constitutional Provisions.
 The trade unions affiliated with the BSPSh have a total
 membership of approximately 250,000, according to recent
 estimates. They and the BSPSh are totally independent of both
 the Government and of Albania's political parties. Those unions
 which were arms of the APL in the former one-party state have
 retained links to the Socialist Party.
 Workers frequently exercised their right to strike in 1991. In
 mid-May, for example, BSPSh called a general strike against the
 Government to obtain its demands for a 50-percent increase in
 wages and pensions, a 6-hour day, a ban on night-shift work for
 women, and the immediate arrest and trial of those responsible
 for the Shkoder killings. Within a week, almost 350,000
 workers, or approximately 75 percent of the industrial work
 force, had joined the strike. Some union members were briefly
 detained during the course of the strike, and some reportedly
 received death threats. However, the strike forced the
 resignation of the all-APL Nano Government on June 3; and on
 June 7 the strike ended following a meeting between union
 leaders and Prime Minister-designate Bufi at which he agreed to
 address their demands following the formation of his government.
 On June 17, the Government of National Stability announced a
 general 50-percent increase in wages in the state-owned sector
 of the economy (virtually the entire economy at that time),
 while miners, who had received a raise of 60 percent in January,
 were to receive a 15-percent increase. A similar increase in
 pensions was announced at the same time. The increases took
 place in two stages, half in July and half in October.
 Despite dramatic progress in the area of worker rights, much of
 the legal and administrative machinery necessary to protect and
 promote the exercise of these rights is still not in place.
 Many independent union leaders assert that the administrative
 functions of the Government are still largely in the hands of
 personnel held over from the Marxist dictatorship.
 Albania resumed membership in the International Labor
 Organization on May 29, after a hiatus of almost 25 years, and
 Albanian trade unions are now free to affiliate with
 international trade union organizations, such as the
 International Confederation of Free Trade Unions.
 
 
 1051
 ALBANIA
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 The Law on Major Constitutional Provisions provides for the trade
 unions the status of "juridical persons" who "may sign collective
 working contracts" with both state and private employers. The
 BSPSh leadership had the opportunity to review the Law on
 Collective Contracts with state enterprises passed by the
 People's Assembly in the fall, and the Law on Collective
 Contracts with private enterprises was approved on December 3.
 It is too early to assess the effectiveness of these laws, but
 Western observers report that unions are in practice conducting
 collective bargaining with state and private enterprises. There
 are no special economic zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 The Law on Major Constitutional Provisions is silent on the
 subject of forced or compulsory labor. The draft constitution
 proposed by the APL would guarantee citizens "the right to
 choose and exercise their professions according to their
 capabilities and personal preference." Persons convicted of
 common crimes are not remunerated for the work they perform in
 prison.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 According to the Labor Code of 1980, amended in 1981, the
 minimum age of employment for children is 15. Those under 16
 years of age may not work more than 6 hours per day.
 Information on enforcement of this law is unavailable.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 There is no information available on the current minimum wage;
 the proposed law on collective contracts is expected to set a
 minimum wage. According to the Labor Code, the workweek is 48
 hours. Women, youths under the age of 18, and those with a
 doctor's certificate are prohibited from working underground.
 The Labor Code contains regulations pertaining to occupational
 health and safety, but enforcement is minimal. Unsafe working
 conditions are among the major complaints of Albanian unions.
 There are approximately 50 accidental deaths a year in the
 mining sector alone, according to independent union leaders.
