 BURKINA FASO
 Burkina Faso is ruled by a military regime headed by Captain
 Blaise Compaore who took power on October 15, 1987, from
 Thomas Sankara in the country's fourth military coup since
 1980. The new military regime continued the ban on political
 parties and activities and gave no indication that the country
 will return to constitutional rule. Instead, President
 Compaore has moved to firm up a narrow political base by
 forming a "Popular Front" of various leftwing groups, military
 officers, and miscellaneous civilians to assist in running the
 Government. He also uses a network of revolutionary
 committees (CR's), loosely organized at national, regional,
 and local levels to mobilize the population and promote
 undefined revolutionary goals.
 The Burkina Faso armed forces number about 7,500 members,
 including 5,200 in the army, 100 in the air force, and 2,200
 in the paramilitary gendarmerie and the police. All police
 and internal security forces are controlled by the Ministry of
 Defense.
 Burkina Faso, one of the world's poorer countries, is
 overwhelmingly tied to subsistence agriculture, with 90
 percent of the population living in rural areas. Agriculture
 is, however, highly vulnerable to fluctuations in rainfall.
 Frequent drought, lack of communications and other
 infrastructure, a low literacy rate, and a stagnant economy
 are all longstanding problems. The country has a per capita
 income of $140 per year.
 Human rights continued to be tightly circumscribed in 1988.
 The holding of elections for local CR's and other
 government-sponsored mass organizations resulted in a slight
 easing of restrictions on political debate conducted in
 private. Public speech and the press remained tightly
 controlled. Although the Government released from detention
 or reinstated to their jobs a number of opponents of the
 Sankara regime, it detained scores of people who had been
 associated with the former regime. Many of these detainees
 were severely mistreated and later released without charge,
 but an unknown number, including several exministers, were
 still being held at the end of 1988.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There were no known political killings in 1988. However, in
 November a senior military officer and his wife were
 assassinated in their home in Bobo Dioulasso. Subsequently,
 the Government arrested at least 10 soldiers in connection
 with the murders. The soldiers allegedly had some connection
 with an exiled opposition leader. Radio Burkina announced on
 December 29 that a revolutionary military tribunal had
 sentenced seven soldiers to death and of.e to 20-years in
 prison and had acquitted two others. While details were
 lacking, the authorities reportedly carried out the death
 sentences before the end of the year.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reports of politically motivated disappearance.

 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Mistreatment of detainees is common. After the coup of
 October 15, 1987, the Government arrested more than 40 members
 of the previous government. There were several reports of
 torture of these detainees, e.g., former ministers Valere Some
 and Firmin Diallo. In at least one case there is evidence
 that police or the gendarmerie had severely beaten-a former
 government official for several days before allowing him
 medical care. In May 1988, the gendarmerie detained
 approximately 20-50 students who had participated in an
 antigovernment demonstration and beat several of them,
 allegedly to "teach them a lesson" before releasing them.
 Prison conditions are poor.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 There were continuing reports of arbitrary arrest, followed at
 times by incommunicado detention for days or months without
 charge, in 1988. The law permits preventive detention without
 charge for a maximum of 72 hours, renewable for a single
 72-hour period in criminal cases. In practice, there are
 frequent violations of this restriction in cases involving
 both Burkinabe and foreign nationals, especially in political
 cases. In addition, in cases of emergency or national
 security, the military code, which provides for indefinite
 detention beyond 72 hours, overrides the civil code. Access
 to lawyers is not normally permitted in security cases,
 although it is provided for by law.
 The Government detained as many as 100 persons for political
 reasons during 1988, including as many as 50 students arrested
 in May for planning or participating in a pro-Sankara
 demonstration. Most of the students were released within days
 of their arrest, but two or three were held for 5 months.
 Fifteen or more draftees of the National Popular Service who
 decided to name their subunit after the late President Sankara
 were held without charge for about 2 months before being
 released.
 During 1988 the Government released some of the Sankara
 loyalists who had been detained without charge following the
 1987 coup, as well as a number of persons who had been
 detained in connection with some explosions in Bobo Dioulasso
 in 1985. At the end of 1988, an unknown number of persons
 remained in detention, and there was no indication whether
 they would be brought to trial. A partial list of detainees
 includes three former ministers in the Sankara government
 under house arrest and several military personnel, including
 the military aide-de-camp to Sankara, in prison. In addition,
 about 20 former government employees, who appeared before a
 people's court in 1988 on corruption charges, remained in
 detention (see Section l.e.).
 Some intellectuals, military officers, and former government
 officials have stayed in self-imposed exile, partly due to
 fear for their safety should they return. The new Government
 has encouraged opponents of the previous regime to return
 home. Several political opponents convicted in absentia of
 common crimes while they were in exile were pardoned on August
 4, but none has yet returned. With regard to forced or
 compulsory labor, see Section 6.c.

 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The regular judiciary, patterned after the French system, has
 continued to function for most criminal and civil cases.
 Defendants traditionally receive a fair trial and are
 represented by counsel. In 1987 the Government began the
 practice of appointing civil service attorneys to represent
 those who do not wish to retain, or are unable to afford, a
 private attorney. while this practice should theoretically
 make legal aid widely available, some observers believe this
 is the first step in the gradual elimination of independent
 lawyers.
 During 1988 the people's revolutionary courts begun under
 Sankara continued to hear cases primarily involving public
 corruption.' The president of each people's court is a
 magistrate appointed by the Government to head a tribunal
 composed of magistrates, military personnel, and members of
 the CR's. The court president asks questions directly of the
 defendant. There is no role for a public prosecutor, and the
 accused may consult but not be represented by counsel during
 the session. Witnesses can be called by the court, or they
 can present themselves to give testimony. The defendant is
 presumed to be guilty unless he proves himself innocent.
 The military Government convened a people's court in June to
 try the cases of approximately 20 businessmen and former
 government employees accused of corruption. Subsequently, the
 Government overturned the court's verdicts, following angry
 public reaction to the light sentences given politically
 influential former government employees. A new trial has not
 been set, and the accused remained in jail at the end of
 1988. The Government pardoned and released a number of
 prisoners in 1988, including Paul Rouamba, who had been
 implicated in plotting to overthrow the Government in 1984.
 The trial of the soldiers mentioned in Section l.a. was
 conducted in a military tribunal closed to the public, and at
 year's end there was no information available about the
 proceedings.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Government authorities generally do not interfere in the daily
 lives of ordinary citizens, and there is no general monitoring
 of private correspondence or telephones. In theory, homes may
 be searched only under authority of a warrant issued by the
 attorney general. However, in national security cases, a
 special law permits surveillance, searches, and monitoring of
 telephones and correspondence without a warrant. This law is
 used against persons suspected of opposition to the Government.
 The Compaore Government encourages participation in the CR's
 and also in social class-based organizations being formed to
 support the Popular Front . However, it is not clear if lack
 of participation will result in firings from civil service
 positions, as was the case in previous regimes. Generally,
 pressure to participate in government-sponsored groups appears
 to have eased.

 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 While there is no formal government censorship, the Government
 employs intimidating methods to limit freedom of speech and
 press. For example, repeated references by the regime to
 enemies of the State at home and abroad inhibit both
 government-employed journalists and ordinary citizens from
 expressing critical views. Similarly, it uses occasional
 dismissals from government service and arbitrary arrest to
 quash debate on political topics.
 Under the control of the Minister of Information, the media,
 which consists of a daily newspaper, a weekly magazine, and
 radio and television stations, are all government owned, and
 all journalists are civil servants. The media does not engage
 in serious criticism of the Government and reflects government
 positions on both international and national issues.
 Journalists who try to report stories without political bias
 may be replaced for failing to support sufficiently the
 political views of the Government. The Government quickly
 silenced a satirical government-owned newspaper, which
 criticized selected officials and programs, and stopped
 transmission of a small private all-music radio station
 authorized to broadcast in the last days of the Sankara
 administration.
 Foreign newspapers and magazines entered the country freely
 during 1988. For the most part, foreign journalists traveled
 and filed stories without censorship and enjoyed access to
 government officials. However, in April two foreign
 journalists were detained for several hours and questioned,
 and one was deported after reporting allegations of
 mistreatment of detainees. After publication of antiregime
 stories in 1988 by the magazine Jeune Afrique, the government
 radio station attacked the magazine's reporting. The
 Government did not ban future importation of the publication,
 but later the local distributor for Jeune Afrique (a French
 national) was arrested, charged with espionage and possession
 of a weapon (a pistol), and deported to France.
 Films are subject to censorship by a review board which
 includes religious authorities as well as government
 officials. During 1988 a wide variety of American, French,
 and other foreign films were shown, and there were no known
 instances of political censorship of movies. There is no
 interference with international radio broadcasts.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Under both the Sankara and Compaore Governments, political
 parties have been banned, and administrative permission is
 generally required for assemblies of any kind. Nonpolitical
 associations for business, religious, cultural, sporting, and
 other purposes are allowed and experience no difficulty in
 obtaining permission to meet, nor in associating with
 international bodies in their fields.
 For a discussion of freedom of association as it applies to
 labor unions, see Section 6.a.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Burkina Faso is a secular state, and there is no official
 
 
 30
 BURKINA FASO
 discrimination on religious grounds. Islam and Christianity
 exist side by side, with almost 50 percent of the population
 Muslim and about 20 percent Christian. The remainder of the
 population practices traditional African religions. Muslim
 and Christian holidays are recognized as national holidays.
 Social mobility and access to modern sector jobs are neither
 linked to, nor restricted by, religious affiliations.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Travelers within Burkina Faso are routinely stopped at police
 and military checkpoints. There appears to be little
 restriction on foreign travel for business and tourism. Exit
 permits, once used to limit movements of workers to
 neighboring countries, particularly to the Cote d'Ivoire where
 at least 1 million or more Burkinabe continue to reside and
 work, are no longer required. For several months, the new
 regime did not allow Sankara's widow and her children to leave
 the country, but following appeals by African heads of state
 and the Association of African Jurists, the family departed in
 July.
 Refugees are accepted freely in Burkina Faso, and attempts are
 made to provide for their care in cooperation with the United
 Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. There were
 approximately 270 refugees and displaced persons in Burkina
 Faso at the end of 1988, mainly from Chad.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Neither under President Sankara, nor under President Blaise
 Compaore, have citizens had the right to change their
 government through democratic procedures. Despite four
 changes in leadership since 1980, the military continue to
 dominate the political process. President Compaore has
 expressed a desire to create a more democratic system, but he
 has not publicly mentioned permitting national elections or
 political parties in the future. He relies on an amorphous
 grouping of people, including military officers, to help run
 the Government and has a loose network of revolutionary
 committees (CR's) throughout the country to mobilize support.
 Elections were held in 1988 for lower-level positions in the
 government-sponsored mass organizations, but the upper
 leadership is appointed by Compaore, and the mass
 organizations have no official role in government decisions.
 Some opposition groups began to form clandestinely in 1988,
 notably a pro-Sankara opposition called the Democratic and
 Popular Union-Thomas Sankara. Four women are members of the
 28-member Cabinet.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The new Government has made no attempt to hinder the
 activities of international human rights organizations. It
 replied to at least one of Amnesty International's (AI) 1987
 inquiries, i.e., regarding the detention of Sankara
 officials. (AI questioned the accuracy of the reply.) A
 government-supported organization lobbies against apartheid in
 South Africa and other racial oppression, but it makes no
 effort to examine domestic human rights issues.

 BURKINA FASO
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Minority ethnic groups are as likely to be represented in the
 inner circles of the Government as are the dominant Mossi, who
 comprise 50 percent of the population. Government decisions
 do not favor one ethnic group over another. One ostensible
 reason for the 1983 increase in administrative regions from 11
 to 30 was to improve access of minority groups to local
 administrative authorities.
 The role of women in Burkina Faso is still limited by the
 cultural orientation of a rural African society. Women are
 important in family farming and in the market economy. The
 Government has continued the previous government's commitment
 to expanding opportunities for women, including in cabinet and
 civil service positions.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 There are four labor federations--of which the largest is
 affiliated with the International Confederation of Free Trade
 Unions. There are also a number of autonomous unions. The
 federations take turns representing organized labor at the
 International Labor Organization (ILO) meetings and
 participate in African regional labor meetings as well.
 Organized labor continues to be an important force in
 Burkina. All unions jealously guard their limited
 independence from the Government. However, despite legal
 rights, the unions have been prevented from engaging in
 activities the Government opposes. Many labor leaders were
 arrested and held for long periods under the previous regime.
 Some were reportedly tortured. The new Government's labor
 policy is not clear, but after the coup it immediately
 released the trade unionists then in detention.
 Organized labor has the legal right to strike, but the Sankara
 Government eliminated this right in practice. The Compaore
 Government has not faced major labor unrest, but some minor
 strikes occurred in 1988.
 The ILO Freedom of Association Committee in March dismissed a
 case brought in April 1987 by the Trade Union Confederation of
 Burkina Faso (CSB) which alleged that new government
 regulations infringed on the freedom of association of public
 officials and that several CSB leaders had been detained.
 This followed a communication from the Government indicating
 that all trade unionists had been released and that
 regulations in question would be revised.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 Unions have the right to bargain for increased wages and other
 benefits within a specific bargaining unit such as a company
 or factory but cannot bargain industry wide. They represent
 the interests of their members in the private and public
 sectors, as well as before the labor inspection service of the
 Government and before the courts.
 There are no export processing zones in Burkina Faso. Labor
 legislation is applied uniformly throughout the country.

 BURKINA FASO
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Forced labor is not employed in Burkina Faso.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 The labor code sets the minimum age for employment at 14, the
 average age-for completion of basic secondary school.
 However, the Government lacks the means to enforce this
 provision adequately, even in the small wage sector. Most
 children actually begin work at an earlier age owing to the
 large number of small, family subsistence farms and the
 traditional apprenticeship system.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 A minimum monthly wage of about $75 and a maximum workweek of
 48 hours are stipulated by the labor code, as are safety and
 health provisions. A system of government inspections and
 labor courts ensures that these provisions are applied in the
 small industrial and commercial sectors, but they have been
 impossible to enforce in the dominant subsistence agriculture
 sector which involves 90 percent of the population. As one of
 the poorest countries in the world, wages are not high, but
 the wrenching disequilibrium seen in many urban cities between
 wages and expenditures is not common in Burkina.
