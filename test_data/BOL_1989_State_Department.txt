 Bolivia is a multiparty democracy with an elected president
 and bicameral legislature. With no presidential candidate
 receiving an absolute majority of the popular vote in the
 elections of May 7, 1989, the Bolivian Congress selected Jaime
 Paz Zamora to be President, in accordance with procedures
 mandated by the Constitution. Paz Zamora succeeded Victor Paz
 Estenssoro as President on August 6, 1989.
 Police security forces and the military are generally
 controlled by and responsive to the civilian Government.
 Bolivia is the second poorest country in the Western
 Hemisphere, and its economy only began to show consistent
 growth in 1988-89 after years of severe contraction. Although
 rich in mineral resources, in recent years Bolivia has
 experienced high domestic production costs and low
 international minerals prices. A major restructuring of the
 minerals industry has contributed to already high
 unemployment, currently about 20 percent.
 The outgoing Paz Estenssoro administration's stringent
 economic reforms ended the financial mismanagement and
 hyperinflation of 1982-85 but were strongly opposed by
 organized labor. Small coca-growing farmers resisted the
 outgoing administration's antinarcotics campaign.
 Human rights are provided for by the Constitution and are
 widely respected. In response to increasingly violent street
 demonstrations and a prolonged hunger strike in support of
 teachers' union demands, the Government imposed a state of
 siege on November 15 and detained more than 850 labor
 activists; most were released within hours, nearly all within
 10 days. People of European or mixed-race origin continue to
 dominate the political and economic system to the detriment of
 ethnic Indians. There are occasional reports of abuse of
 prisoners and detainees by police, as well as concerns about
 an overburdened and sometimes corrupt judicial system.
 Bolivian women do not yet enjoy a status in society equal to
 that of men but are gradually assuming a greater role in
 business and the professions.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 There were no political or other extrajudicial killings by the
 Government in 1989. A terrorist group calling itself "Zarate
 Willca" claimed responsibility for the politically motivated
 machine-gun murder of two American citizen Mormon missionaries
 in La Paz in May 1989. A government investigation resulted in
 the arrest of four persons on charges of terrorist activities
 and other crimes. No findings were announced in the
 Government's investigation into the reported death of a
 peasant at Achacachi last year at the hands of the military.
 Late in 1989 Bolivian authorities arrested Luis Arce Gomez,
 the notorious Interior Minister of the regime of General
 Garcia Meza in 1980-1981. Widely despised for his role in the
 tortures, kidnapings, and extrajudicial killing which
 characterized that regime, Arce Gomez was also active in
 narcotics trafficking. He faced charges and prosecution in
 
 
 BOLIVIA
 both Bolivia and the United States.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances
 in Bolivia in 1989. Judicial proceedings are continuing in
 cases involving disappearances during the early 1980's (before
 the restoration of democracy), and the courts collected
 further testimony as evidence during 1989.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 The Constitution prohibits torture, and the Government neither
 condones nor practices such activity. However, there have
 been occasional charges of cruelty toward or degrading
 treatment of detainees by individual police officers. Police,
 prison, and security personnel are rarely tried and punished
 for such acts. Corruption, malnutrition, unsanitary
 conditions, and drug-related problems are endemic in Bolivia's
 overcrowded prison system.
 Clear evidence surfaced in 1989 of serious human rights abuses
 over a period of years at the Espejos Rehabilitation Farm in
 Santa Cruz department. According to testimony and forensic
 evidence made public in late 1989, a number of prisoners were
 severely mistreated and some, perhaps 40 or more, died and
 were secretly buried in a clandestine cemetery. The officer
 in charge of Los Espejos has been remanded for criminal
 prosecution, and other officials face sanctions of various
 kinds.
 The Government which took office on August 6 is publicly
 committed to ameliorating conditions in the country's prisons.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The Constitution requires a court order for an arrest, and
 detainees must be charged or released within 24 hours. The
 Constitution also provides for a judicial determination of the
 legality of a detention, and prisoners are usually released if
 a judge rules that they have been detained illegally. After
 the initial detention, prisoners may consult a lawyer of their
 choice. Provisions for bail exist in Bolivia except in
 certain narcotics cases, and bail is generally granted.
 Under the provisions of the state of siege declared by the
 President on November 15, constitutional protections were
 suspended and over 850 labor union activists were detained in
 overnight police roundups. About 150 were transported to
 small communities for internal exile, but all were released
 within 10 days.
 With regard to forced or compulsory labor, see Section 6.c.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The constitutional right of fair public trial is adhered to in
 most respects, but long delays in the judicial system are
 common. Investigations, trials, and appeals procedures are so
 lengthy that some prisoners eventually serve more time than
 the maximum sentence for the crime with which they are being
 charged. Defendants have the right to an attorney, to
 confront witnesses, to present evidence, and to appeal a
 judicial decision. These rights generally are upheld in
 
 
 479
 BOLIVLIA
 practice. Although the law provides for a court-appointed
 defense attorney at public expense, if necessary, one may not
 always be provided because of a shortage of funds and
 qualified personnel. The Constitution authorizes the Supreme
 Court, Bolivia's highest civilian judicial body, to review
 legislative measures to determine if they are in accordance
 with a citizen's "specific rights or the Constitution."
 The military regime of 1976 revised the military penal code
 and established the military court system. The law defined
 and established military jurisdiction over actions against the
 security of the State and against military personnel and
 property.
 Corruption of the judicial system remains a serious problem.
 Narcotics traffickers often bribe judicial and other officials
 in exchange for releasing suspected traffickers and their
 aircraft, returning captured drugs, and purging incriminating
 files. The Government has taken some steps to discipline
 Bolivia's judicial system. Under provisions of the
 antinarcotics legislation signed into law in July 1988, the
 Government has begun creating three-judge special narcotics
 control courts. They are to function as first-insfance
 tribunals in narcotics-related cases.
 Terrorist threats against judges and other officials involved
 in the cases of four detainees allegedly linked to "Zarate
 Willca" (see Section l.a.) delayed the timely consideration of
 the charges against the four defendants.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The sanctity of the home and the privacy of citizens' lives
 are protected by the Constitution and are normally respected
 in practice.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 By law, citizens enjoy freedom of speech and exercise it
 widely without government interference. Both state-owned and
 private radio and television stations operate in Bolivia. All
 newspapers are privately owned. Since the restoration of
 democracy in 1982, Bolivians have enjoyed a generally
 unrestricted press representing the full spectrum of political
 views.
 The privately owned La Paz television channel 4 and Radio
 Metropolitana, which were closed by the Government in June
 1988 after they broadcast an interview with then-fugitive
 narcotics trafficker Roberto Suarez, were allowed to reopen in
 1989. The owner of the two closed media outlets organized a
 political party in September 1988 and campaigned freely for
 president, even while his stations remained off the air. His
 party won a plurality in the balloting in La Paz Department.
 The Government has consistently respected academic freedom.
 Public universities enjoy autonomous status by law, and that
 status is respected.
 
 
 480
 BQLIVIA
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The rights of peaceful assembly and association are provided
 for by law and generally respected-in practice.
 On November 14, however, the Government imposed a state of
 siege in response to civil disturbances growing out of a
 strike by the nation's teachers, and police arrested over 850
 people (see Section l.d.). Apart from the arrests, curfew
 restrictions and other curbs on assembly were relatively minor.
 For a discussion of freedom of association as it applies to
 labor unions, see Section 6.a.
 c.' Freedom of Religion
 Roman Catholicism predominates in Bolivia, and the
 Constitution recognizes it as the country's official religion;
 Catholic bishops receive a nominal stipend from the State.
 Other religious groups, however, operate openly. The Mormons,
 Baha'is, Seventh-Day Adventists, Methodists, and others freely
 proselytize and operate churches, training centers, and social
 welfare projects throughout the country. The small Jewish
 community has not reported any discrimination. Citizens are
 free to practice the religion of their choice and to maintain
 links with coreligionists abroad.
 The Government has issued rules designating the Roman Catholic
 Church to coordinate all public ceremonies in which
 governmental authorities and institutions participate. Based
 on a decree issued in July 1985, the Government of President
 Paz Estenssoro (1985-1989) declared all existing religious
 registrations void, and required religious groups to
 reregister. In 1989 the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and
 Worship reiterated that numerous religious groups were
 operating in Bolivia illegally (that is, without legal
 registration) and threatened to begin legal proceedings
 against them. The Government of President Paz Zamora has
 indicated that it may move soon to write the administrative
 regulations for registration into law, a step which would
 require further congressional action. Some evangelical
 Protestant groups complain that they are subject to more
 stringent registration procedures than the Catholic Church.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 There are no restrictions on travel within Bolivia or abroad.
 The Government does not impede emigration and guarantees
 departing citizens the right to return. Citizenship is not
 revoked for political reasons.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Bolivia is -a multiparty democracy with an elected president
 and a functioning, independent, bicameral legislature.
 Opposition groups function freely both in and out of the
 Congress. On May 7, Bolivia held free and fair elections
 which resulted in a peaceful, constitutional change of
 administration on August 6.
 Suffrage has been universal since the 1952 revolution.
 Nevertheless, people of European or mixed-race origin are
 predominant in the political system.
 
 
 BO~ULIA
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government is sensitive to the opinions of both
 international and domestic organizations and is willing to
 discuss human rights concerns with them. The Congress has
 committees responsible for monitoring observance of human
 rights. The Catholic Church, the Permanent Assembly on Human
 Rights in Bolivia (APDHB), labor organizations, and the press
 have been aggressive monitors of human rights. These
 organizations comment frequently on issues and developments
 related to human rights.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Although protected in theory and sometimes in practice by
 social legislation, Bolivian women do not enjoy a social
 status equal to that of men. Cultural traditions, social
 conditions, and limited political influence remain major
 obstacles to advancement for women. In rural families, women
 contribute significantly to economic activities and often
 control the family finances, but nonetheless they are
 considered socially and politically subordinate. In urban
 settings, women are slowly achieving a greater role in
 business and professional life, as their participation in
 cooperatives, community affairs, and education increases.
 There are no reliable and complete statistics indicating the
 extent of violence against women in Bolivia. A study prepared
 by a women's rights group in November 1989 cataloged 98
 articles in 5 major newspapers between March and October 1989
 concerning violence involving women (including such categories
 as suicide, attempted suicide, and death in childbirth).
 Violence against women is a criminal offense in Bolivia, and
 legal sanctions are regularly applied when cases come to the
 attention of the authorities. However, many women are
 reluctant to bring charges in cases of domestic violence, and
 the incidence of such abuse as wife beating is very likely
 underreported. Legal counseling is available for women on a
 limited basis through private organizations.
 Although prohibited by the Constitution, discrimination
 against people of indigenous background continues. The
 Aymara- and Quechua-speaking Indian majority of the population
 remains at the lower end of the country's socioeconomic scale
 and is disadvantaged in terms of health, life expectancy,
 education, income, and employment. All political leaders
 acknowledge it-is a problem. The Government's programs to
 ease Bolivia's economic crisis, including activities sponsered
 by the Social Emergency Fund, are of direct benefit to some of
 the disadvantaged, within the constraints of severely limited
 resources.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Bolivian workers have the right to establish and join
 organizations of their own choosing, and they are free to
 elect their own leaders. They possess and exercise the right
 to strike. Labor law prohibits any labor contract which
 denies workers' constitutional rights and freedoms. The
 Bolivian Workers Central (COB), an umbrella labor organization
 
 
 482
 BO~ULIA
 which represents the majority of unionized workers, is
 independent of the Government. In past years it has
 frequently paralyzedthe economy with crippling strikes. In
 1989, despite declines in membership and political influence,
 the COB mobilized demonstrations on various social and
 economic issues throughout the country.
 Some COB affiliates, such as the teachers' union, went out on
 strike for extended periods during 1989. Antigovernment labor
 demonstrations, most of which were associated with these
 strikes, were generally more peaceful than in the past, but
 some occasionally resulted in violence between demonstrators
 and police or military personnel. On November 15, the
 Government declared a state of siege and detained over 850
 labor abtivists including officials of the teachers, union as
 well as senior officers of the Communist-led COB. About 159
 of those detained were sent to internal exile in small towns
 but all were released within 10 days.
 The Government places no restrictions on a union's right to
 join international labor organizations. The COB, which had
 been independent since its founding in 1952, became an
 affiliate of the Communist-controlled World Federation of
 Trade Unions in 1988. As in previous years, the COB in 1989
 was represented at the International Labor Organization (ILO)
 convention in Geneva.
 In its 1989 report, the ILO Committee of Experts (COE) cited
 several provisions of Bolivian labor law which do not conform
 with Convention 87 on Freedom of Association, including:
 denial of the right of public workers to organize unions; the
 requirement for prior authorization before forming a union;
 the limit of one union in an enterprise; the possibility of
 dissolving a union by administrative action; and, the power of
 the executive to prohibit strikes by imposing compulsory
 arbitration. The Committee encouraged the Government to adopt
 legislation developed in cooperation with the ILO which would
 rectify these shortcomings.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 Bolivian workers have the right to organize and bargain
 collectively. The law does not extend this right to
 government workers, but the distinction is largely ignored in
 practice, as virtually all government workers are unionized.
 Negotiations between government representatives and freely
 elected labor leaders are common.
 The Labor Ministry has an established procedure for resolving
 union complaints of discrimination or unfair practices by
 employers and does not hesitate to involve itself in mediation
 of labor disputes. In the wake of a Supreme Court ruling, a
 legal dispute over the procedure by which unions select their
 leaders is pending and may have to be settled by legislation.
 There are no export processing zones or other areas in which
 organizing or collective bargaining are impeded.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Bolivian law prohibits forced or compulsory labor, and none
 has been reported.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 
 
 483
 BOLIVIA
 Bolivian law prohibits the employment of minors under 18 years
 of age in dangerous, unhealthy, or immoral work. Revisions in
 Bolivia's 50-year-old Labor Code, which Bolivian officials
 discussed during the year with experts from the ILO, may
 clarify ambiguities in the law concerning the employment of
 children under 14 years of age. In practice, the legal
 provisions concerning employment of children are not
 rigorously enforced.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 Bolivia's labor laws contain conditions for child protection,
 paid vacations, and protection of workers' health and safety.
 In practice these laws are not rigorously observed, and the
 Government has not provided funds for adequate enforcement.
 The mines, often old and operated with antiquated equipment,
 are particularly dangerous and unhealthy. In urban areas,
 about half the labor force observe an 8-hour day and a
 workweek of 5 or 5 1/2 days.
 Bolivia has a minimum wage law as well as an elaborate system
 of bonuses and compensations for the private sector. In 1989
 the Government fixed the minimum wage at the equivalent of
 approximately $23 per month. A minimum wage earner cannot
 easily support a family at an acceptable standard of living.
 Moreover, labor leaders and the APDHB, while conceding the
 Government's achievements in bringing financial stability out
 of the chaos of 1985, continue to express concern that high
 rates of unemployment are contributing to difficult living
 conditions, despite the modest economic gains of 1987-89.
