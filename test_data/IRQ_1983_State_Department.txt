 IRAQ
 Iraq is ruled by the Arab Ba'ath Socialist Party of Iraq through a
 Revolutionary Command Council. The Council has both executive and
 legislative authority and, in effect, rules by decree under the
 provisional Constitution of 1968. Saddam Hussein holds near
 absolute power as President of the Republic and Chairman of the
 Revolutionary Command Council.
 Cabinet ministers, with administrative and some legislative
 responsibilities, and governors of each of the 18 provinces, who
 have extensive administrative powers, are appointed by the
 Council. A National Assembly, elected in 1980, has limited
 authority and is guided by Ba'ath Party views.
 Iraq was carved out of the former Ottoman Empire at the end of the
 first World War. Its somewhat arbitrarily drawn borders contain
 many disparate groupings, most notably Shi'a and Sunni Arab
 Muslims, Kurds, and Turcomans in the North, and various Christian
 sects, predominantly Assyrians and Chaldeans. Periods of political
 instability and violence often involved rivalries among these
 groups. Since Iraq gained its independence from Britain in 1932
 successive regimes have been toppled, until the Ba'ath Party came
 to power in 1968.
 Political rights in Iraq are sharply limited. Effective rule is in
 the hands of a small elite within the Ba'ath Party, and little
 dissent from government policies is tolerated. Media censorship is
 endemic. There are few dependable sources about many government
 practices. The Government does not acknowledge human rights
 violations but has permitted the International Committee of the Red
 Cross (ICRC) to operate in Iraq and also has permitted a visit by
 representatives of Amnesty International. Activities which the
 state considers threats to its security can lead to detention
 without charge, severe prison sentences, mistreatment, torture, or
 summary execution. Most of these actions are carried out by a
 large and feared internal security police force and the
 intelligence services. Summary executions may be carried out
 because of suspected opposition to the Ba'ath, for factional
 reasons, or as punishment for poor performance in military
 operations.
 There was little change in the human rights picture in 1983,
 although the replacement of the head of the General Intelligence
 Directorate in October 1983 raised hopes that repressive practices
 would be curtailed. Also, in October, President Saddam Hussein
 stated that Iraq had cut all support to the Black June terrorist
 group, adding to earlier indications of a change in Iraq's past
 support for this and other terrorist groups. In November, all
 members of the Black June group were reliably reported to have been
 expelled from Iraq.
 Throughout 1983 Iraq remained locked in a seemingly stalemated,
 total war with Iran. The war threatens the survival both of Iraq's
 political system and its national identity. The regime has used
 the war to rally the populace against the foreign enemy, thus
 gaining a measure of popular support. While most fighting has been
 confined to strategic military or economic targets along the
 border, civilian areas have been bombed and shelled on both sides.
 Several Iranian offensives launched during the year have led to
 fierce fighting and considerable casualties. Iran has charged that
 Iraq has used prohibited chemical weapons. While denying these
 charges, Iraq has implied its willingness to use such weapons
 
 (1268)
 
 
 1269
 if Iran continues its attacks. Since the war began, over 100,000
 Iraqi soldiers have been killed or captured, with additional
 thousands wounded. Beginning in 1980, tens of thousands of
 Iranians and Iraqis alleged to be of Iranian origin were deported,
 without judicial proceedings, to Iran from Iraq. The practice
 apparently has ceased, but the Government maintains a close watch
 on persons of Iranian descent and has incarcerated many persons
 suspected of pro-Iranian activity or sympathy.
 Iranian prisoners of war in Iraq are estimated at approximately
 8,000. Most are believed to be registered with the ICRC, which
 visits the camps. Prisoners of war in Iraq were believed to have
 faced instances of physical mistreatment and inadequate diet.
 Treatment of prisoners in Iraq is authoritatively reported to have
 improved since the ICRC released a report in May 1983 critical of
 both sides.
 Conflict between Government forces and Kurds intensified in 1983.
 Kurdish rebels, with their Communist Party of Iraq allies, stepped
 up attacks on government, military, party, and security facilities,
 mostly at night. With the deteriorating situation, curfews have
 been imposed on a number of major highways and secondary roads in
 the north of Iraq where Kurdish rebels have been active. Travel
 restrictions, which prevent most Iraqis from departing the country,
 remained in effect thoughout 1983.
 Iraq has a nominally socialist form of economy, but in recent years
 has permitted the expansion of a private capitalist sector. The
 wealth generated by Iraq's oil production has been used to promote
 light industrial and agricultural development, as well as
 improvements in health, education, and transportation services,
 improving economic and social conditions for much of the
 population. There have been recent spending cutbacks and many
 projects have been delayed or slowed by the adverse effect on the
 economy of the continuing war with Iran and the inability of Iraq
 to market its oil at pre-war levels. The regime has sought to
 maintain development projects and social expenditures despite a
 severe wartime austerity program.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1   Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Unlawful or Arbitrary Deprivation of Life
 Executions have been an established method for dealing with
 perceived political and military opponents of the Government,
 particularly members of the outlawed Da'wa Party (Shi'a Muslims),
 the Communist Party, and Kurds. In October 1983, Amnesty
 International stated that it has the names of 520 political
 prisoners reported to have been executed since 1978. Members of
 the political elite have also been executed as a result of
 factional conflict, with known cases as recent as late 1982.
 Because of the secrecy surrounding executions, confirmation is
 almost impossible to obtain.
 Amnesty International in the past investigated allegations of
 poisonings of political suspects, and independent physicians have
 reported that this was practiced in Iraq at least through 1979.
 There has been no confirmation whether this practice has ceased or
 continued in more recent years.
 
 
 1270
 From October to December, 1983, Iran repeated charges it had made
 in October 1982 that Iraq has used prohibited chemical weapons.
 Iraq has repeatedly denied the charges, but has emphasized that it
 is engaged in total war as long as Iran rejects all ceasefire
 initiatives. In April 1983 Iraq stated its willingness to use "new
 weapons . . . that will destroy any moving creature . . . not used
 in previous attacks because of humanitarian and ethical reasons"
 if Iran continues to attack Iraq. Iraq is a signatory to the 1925
 Geneva protocol banning use of lethal and incapacitating chemical
 weapons.
 Several prominent members of the Al-Hakim family, noted for Shi'a
 religious and political activism, were taken from their homes in
 Najaf and executed during the summer of 1983, although individually
 they were not held responsible for any crime. The killings, which
 senior government officials acknowledged to Western journalists,
 were in reprisal for activities of family members who lead
 movements against the Iraqi Government in Iran and Western Europe.
 Government repression of Kurdish dissidence likewise has been
 severe. In addition to forced resettlement of entire villages,
 reliable reports indicate that the military has conducted aerial
 attacks on Kurdish villages suspected of supporting Iranian
 military incursions into northeastern Iraq or harboring
 anti-government guerillas. The extent of civilian casualties
 resulting from such action is unknown.
 While summary executions of ineffective officers have been reported
 in past years, in most cases in 1983 officers who have proven
 unsuccessful on the battlefield have been demoted or retired rather
 than shot.
 In 1983, terrorists who resided in or transited Iraq with the
 permission of the Government carried out assassinations and
 assassination attempts abroad. Two such groups were the Black June
 Organization led by Sabri Al-Banna or "Abu Nidal," and the May 15
 Organization. A Reuters press service story alleged that during
 1982 some Iraqi intelligence officers also held ranks in the Black
 June Organization. The article also alleged that Naouff Rosan,
 later convicted of attempting to assassinate the Israeli Ambassador
 in London in June, 1982, was an Iraqi officer. There is no
 independent evidence to support either.allegation. A Black June
 representative in Syria claimed the assassination of Palestinian
 Liberation Organization (PLO) leader Yassir Arafat's political
 representative in Lisbon in April, 1983. In 1983 Black June also
 attempted or successfully carried out assassinations of Jordanian
 diplomats in Rome, New Delhi, and Madrid, apparently with the
 approval or support of Syria, which is the common bitter adversary
 of Iraq and Jordan. Iraq supports Arafat's leadership of the PLO
 and is closely allied with Jordan. There has been no evidence to
 link specific Black June or other terrorist operations to the Iraqi
 Government since September 1982.
 In an October 1983 interview with French journalists, President
 Hussein said that his Government had discontinued all financial and
 other assistance to Abu Nidal, among others. In 1983 Abu Nidal's
 terrorist organization built up its ties with the Syrian and other
 governments hostile to Iraq. In November, Black June's
 infrastructure and personnel, including Abu Nidal himself, were
 reliably reported to have been expelled from Iraq. Other
 Palestinian groups such as the May 15 Organization, who may still
 be present or represented in Baghdad, are not known to have carried
 out terrorist attacks from Iraq since September of 1982.
 
 
 1271
 terrorism also has been directed against the Government of Iraq and
 its people by groups supported by Syria and Iran. The simultaneous
 car bombings of Air Force headquarters and a broadcasting station
 in Baghdad in April 1983 have been attributed to terrorists
 supported by Iran.
 b. Disappearance
 Iraqi emigrants have reported that disappearance follows the
 abduction by security police of some suspects, particularly those
 wanted for broadly-defined subversion. Family members rarely know
 where, why, or even if relatives are being held. It is difficult
 to ascertain whether an execution has occurred or whether a person
 may have died under torture or is still incarcerated. Amnesty
 International has submitted to the Iraqi authorities the names of
 114 people whose whereabouts remain unknown since they were
 reported arrested between 1979 and 1982. In recent years, leftist
 Kurds in northern Iraq have kidnapped some Western businessmen at
 random. In 1982, Kurds kidnapped one American and released him
 after four months. Ransom demands have included money, a halt to
 Western economic cooperation with Iraq, and Western support for the
 release of prisoners in Iraq. The number of such kidnappings
 declined in 1983 to fewer than 10. Those kidnapped generally have
 been released following negotiations involving overseas Kurdish
 representatives on one hand, and victims' employers and Iraqi
 security organizations on the other.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 According to former prisoners, persons arrested for political or
 security related matters and detained by the security police are
 frequently tortured and otherwise mistreated. Treatment is
 reported to be worst immediately following arrest and during the
 period of interrogation and investigation, which can last for
 months. Treatment often improves upon completion of investigation
 or sentencing. However, torture and brutal treatment are not
 always limited to political cases. The definition of
 security-related offenses is sufficiently broad so as to include
 criminal matters such as currency violations.
 The Government consistently rejects charges that it practices
 torture. Although the Constitution prohibits torture and
 prescribes stiff punishment for any who practice it, reliable
 reports make it clear that both physical and psychological torture
 are extensively used by Iraqi authorities, especially the security
 police. Given the rigid chain of command within the Iraqi
 Government and security services, it is extremely unlikely that
 torture could be practiced without the acquiescence, if not the
 authorization, of senior officials.
 Torture practices include beating with rubber hoses or planks,
 suspension from a ceiling fan, and electric shock treatment.
 Psychological measures are said to include threatening detainees
 with loaded weapons, playing tape recordings of torture sessions,
 and threatening arrest, torture, or abuse of the detainee's family.
 In a special human rights report on Iraq released in October 1983,
 Amnesty International said it had asked the Iraqi authorities to
 examine 23 cases of people reported to have died under torture
 since 1976. Among the cases cited by Amnesty International
 stretching from 1976 to 1981, are those of a young Kurd, whose
 grotesquely mutilated corpse was returned to'his family; a member
 of the Iraqi Communist Party, who is said to have been beaten with
 a wire whip while suspended from a rotating ceiling fan and then
 electrocuted; and a'man reported to have died in a Baghdad
 
 30-231 0 - 84 - 81
 
 
 1272
 hospital, understood to have suffered kidney failure after he was
 hung upside down, beaten, and had a wire inserted into his body.
 The Amnesty Report follows a 1981 medical investigation of released
 prisoners which was submitted to the U.N. Subcommittee on Human
 Rights in Geneva, which showed a uniform pattern of torture.
 Torture and mistreatment are not confined to Iraqis. Diplomats in
 Iraq reliably report instances where nationals of their countries
 have suffered extreme physical and mental abuse while in prison or
 under detention in Iraq. An American recently released after three
 and one half months in a security detention center in Baghdad was
 beaten and subjected to electric shocks, and lost several toenails
 when an interrogator smashed his toes with heavy boots. His
 interrogators also threatened him with mutilation and told him that
 his wife and children had been arrested and would be mistreated.
 He was held in solitary confinement for over one month, fed an
 inadequate diet including spoiled and heavily salted food to induce
 thirst, denied medical care which he requested after torture, and
 forbidden to clean his cell for long periods. Nevertheless, he
 described his treatment during detention and interrogation as
 "nothing" compared to that of Iraqi citizens and other Arabs whom
 he encountered.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Iraq's Constitution and legal code provide guarantees for the
 rights of citizens and checks on police powers in such areas as
 arrest, detention, imprisonment, and search. These are generally
 respected in criminal cases. However, when political or "national
 security" matters are concerned, these guarantees have little
 weight. Iraqis are subject to arbitrary arrest on both political
 and security grounds. The Government has also been known to arrest
 family members, including women and children, of persons it seeks.
 On the international level, such "hostage-taking" has been used in
 attempts to secure the release of Iraqis held on criminal charges
 in other countries. In one recent case, the Government is reported
 to have clearly informed the representatives of a foreign
 government that it would detain a national of that country until a
 detained Iraqi was freed.
 Security police frequently secretly detain suspects. Authorities
 often refuse to acknowledge such arrests, denying any knowledge of
 these "missing" individuals. In some cases their fate has become
 known only after execution. Charges have included espionage,
 treason, conspiracy against the party and revolution, and plotting
 against Iraq, often in collaboration with named or unnamed external
 foes. Reliable information regarding the number of political
 prisoners in Iraq is unavailable. However, the Abu Ghurayb penal
 facility in Baghdad, where political prisoners are detained along
 with serious criminal offenders and draft evaders, has been
 extensively occupied in 1983 and new temporary buildings have been
 erected to contain the overflow. Political prisoners, estimated at
 over one third of the total of as many as 40,000 prisoners at Abu
 Ghurayb, are segregated into groups which are permitted periodic
 visits and those denied all access. The latter group includes many
 of those who "disappeared" and are secretly detained. Unknown
 numbers of political prisoners are also held elsewhere in Iraq.
 Suspected Shi'a dissidents, particularly members of the outlawed
 Da'wa Party, have been incarcerated. Following a July 1982
 assassination attempt on the President by a predominantly Shi'a
 group, foreign journalists reported that security forces arrested
 more than 300 persons, including family members of those killed in
 the attempt. According to Amnesty International, in May 1983 more
 
 
 1273
 than 130 members of the Al-Hakim family, ranging in age from 9 to
 76. were arrested. The arrests probably were meant to intimidate
 the prominent members of this family now in exile in Iran and
 elsewhere who founded the Da'wa party and lead anti-government
 activities with foreign backing. The Government confirmed these
 arrests and also stated that some of the family members were
 released following interrogation.
 Over 30,000 Iranians and Iraqis of known or alleged Iranian descent
 were summarily expelled to Iran in April 1980 and tens of thousands
 more were reportedly expelled subsequently. While such
 deportations have ceased for the most part, those remaining live
 under the threat of deportation or with the fear of incarceration
 within Iraq. Many "Iranian" families have been in Iraq for
 generations. Some claim their forebears were not from Iran but
 claimed Iranian nationality to evade Ottoman military
 conscription. Citizens considered to be of Iranian origin bear
 specially marked identification, often precluding desirable
 employment. Those already employed face impediments to advancement.
 In recent years Amnesty International has issued reports alleging
 the imprisonment or detention of large numbers of Kurds. Reliable
 figures on detainees are not available. Recently there have been
 reports that hundreds of relatives of Kurdish fighters who joined
 Iranian invasion forces during the Haj Umran offensive in the
 summer of 1983 were arrested and detained in unknown locations
 outside of Kurdistan. It has also been reported that the
 Government has rounded up young men in villages suspected of
 harboring sympathy for Kurdish dissidents and detained them in
 concentration-type camps.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The Iraqi judicial system is based on a combination of Islamic and
 Napoleonic Law. Cases are decided in Criminal, Civil, Islamic,
 Revolutionary, and, in some cases, "Special" Courts. In general,
 punishment can be severe.
 In criminal cases, the first stage after an arrest is an
 investigation performed by the police, who present their findings
 to a judge, normally within a day. The judge determines if the
 accused is to be held for further investigation or released on
 bail. This detention period normally lasts up to one month, but
 the law provides no limit. The suspect is allowed to consult a
 lawyer, and any statements made to investigators may be denied
 later. The results of the investigation are forwarded to an
 inquiry judge who then decides whether to drop the case or refer it
 to the criminal court. The judge can ask for further information
 before making his decision. Any statements made to an inquiry
 judge are taken under oath and cannot be denied later. The inquiry
 judge decides whether the suspect should be released on bail or
 held in detention awaiting trial. All decisions made by the
 inquiry judge are appealable to the court of cassation. Trials in
 the criminal courts of first instance are heard by one judge. Iraq
 has no jury system. Defendants are entitled to a lawyer. The
 court will appoint one if so requested. Because the personal
 relationship between a judge and lawyer is perceived as important,
 many people involved in criminal cases prefer to select their own
 lawyer and often do so only after the name of the judge has been
 announced.
 The trial judge generally bases his decision on the information
 collected by investigators and the inquiry judge. He can hear
 witnesses if he chooses or rely on written depositions alone. For
 
 
 1274
 minor cases, appeals are made only to the courts of cassation,
 where cases are heard by a panel of three judges. For major
 crimes, the appeal may be continued to the High Court of Appeals,
 before a panel of five judges.
 Civil matters are dealt with separately by the civil courts.
 Family matters such as marriage, divorce, inheritance, and child
 custody are handled by religious courts administering Islamic law.
 While sentences can be severe, judges do have discretion to impose
 less than the maximum prescribed sentence. Judges are generally
 free from governmental interference, but they operate according to
 laws which easily can be changed by decree.
 Trials in criminal, civil, and religious courts are open. Closed
 trials are the rule in the revolutionary courts, which hear crimes
 affecting "national security". Cases heard by this court generally
 result in a quick decision and punishments include the death
 penalty. The right of defense in the revolutionary courts is
 severely restricted, according to Amnesty International.
 Furthermore, it reports that there is no such right at all in other
 "Special Courts". These have been constituted by the Revolutionary
 Command Council for specific incidents, such as the reported
 conspiracy against the regime in 1979. These special tribunals are
 apparently exempt from constitutional safeguards of defendants'
 rights. In its 1983 report, Amnesty International called for the
 abandonment of special courts set up to try political cases. It
 charged that they do not guarantee fair trials.
 f. Arbitary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence.
 The Government of Iraq is controlled by the Ba'ath Party. Party
 membership is viewed as a key to advancement, both inside and
 outside the Government. Emigrants occasionally report harassment
 by Ba'ath student organizations to join while in school. Some
 claim to have been beaten for refusal. As a result, some profess
 to have joined the party to avoid such treatment or to enhance
 career prospects.
 There is no legal protection against the monitoring of telephones,
 which many Iraqis believe to be a common practice. Likewise, all
 mail is subject to review by censors. Government security services
 and the Ba'ath Party are generally assumed to maintain pervasive
 networks of informers.
 Certain ethnic and religious groups within Iraq traditionally
 reside in particular areas of the country. Kurds, for example,
 have strong roots in the north. There have been some efforts by
 the Government to force changes in these settlement patterns,
 especially in the case of the Kurds. A mass relocation of Kurds
 took place after the Kurdish rebellion in the mid-1970's. Large
 numbers of Kurds were resettled in the south of Iraq. The
 Government attempted tu create a security zone along northern
 borders with Iran and Turkey. It moved Kurds and others from the
 zone to distant areas. Most of those forcibly relocated have been
 allowed to return subsequently, although not to their original
 villages. Host have been resettled in government-built'centers.
 More recently, families and villages of the tribe of the late
 Kurdish opposition leader Mulla Mustapha Barzani have been
 forcibily resettled by the Government following the participation
 by some tribe members in Iran's invasions of northern Iraq in
 summer 1983. In addition to dispersing Kurds throughout Iraq,
 there have been various attempts to dilute their geographic
 majority in the north by moving in ethnic Arabs.
 
 
 1275
 Strong cultural values tend to reinforce constitutional protections
 of the inviolability of the home. Police must obtain a search
 warrant before entering the home of a criminal suspect. However,
 warrants are not required for the arrest of security suspects,
 which has become a broadly defined category. While most arrests
 occur outside the home, there have been reports of forced entry and
 arrest by the security police. Targets have included suspected
 members of the outlawed Da'wa Party.
 Section 2     Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Government views any form of political dissent as a threat to
 the security of the country and strictly limits the exercise of the
 rights of speech, press, and assembly. The Constitution prohibits
 .any act aimed at undermining the national unity of the people,
 provoking racial, sectarian, and regional bigotry, or violating
 gains and achievements of the country." Nonetheless, Kurdish is
 recognized as an official language and is used, with Arabic, in
 schools and media in Kurdish areas of northern Iraq. Use of other
 minority languages, while not legally restricted, is generally
 confined to home and church. Minority language programs regularly
 appear on radio and television.
 The Government owns and operates the press, radio, and television.
 Because the media do not criticize the Government, the news is
 strongly biased, and opposition viewpoints are not heard. Very few
 foreign periodicals reach Iraq and Western newspapers are not sold
 on newsstands. Foreign visitors' newspapers, magazines, and
 cassettes often are confiscated at the airport. To control the
 dissemination of political leaflets, typewriters and photocopying
 'machines must be registered with the Government.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Public meetings in Iraq are organized only under the auspices of
 the Government. Non-religious free association and demonstrations
 without Government approval have met with severe repression.
 Professional organizations are subject to control by the Ba'ath
 Party Central Vocational Bureau.
 The unionized workforce is estimated at about 100,000. The Ba'ath
 Party Central Labor Bureau oversees all activities of the labor
 unions. Unions may operate only under guidelines approved by the
 Government. Elections are held within the unions for executive
 councils, which in turn select officers from among themselves.
 Nominees are mainly party members. Workers legally have the right
 to strike after providing notice to the Ministry of Labor, but no
 strikes have been known to occur since 1968. The unions inititate
 grievances to management, but a primary union function is to
 indoctrinate members with Ba'athist doctrine. Union membership is
 a prerequisite for employment in many sectors.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Iraq is an ethnically and religiously diverse society. The present
 Government, whose most sensitive positions generally are
 dominatedby the Sunni Muslim Arab minority (approximately 30
 percent of total population), generally pursues a secular policy
 aimed at culturally assimilating Iraq's various ethnic and
 religious groups, including the Jewish, Yezidi, and Christian
 minorities and the Shi'a majority. In some past instances, this
 has taken the form of trying to wean groups away from their
 
 
 1276
 cultural traditions, languages, ethnic identities, and ways of
 life. However, the Government has relaxed implementation of this
 policy in most cases, and has more actively sought the support of
 ethnic and religious minorities as recognized sub-groups of the
 citizenry.
 Some 50,000 Christians constitute about four percent of the
 population. They legally enjoy freedom of worship in churches of
 established denominations, which receive some support from the
 State, but not the freedom to proselytize or hold meetings outside
 church premises. Convents and monasteries exist and some new
 churches are constructed. In early 1980, the Government instituted
 obligatory Koranic studies for all students including non-Muslims.
 The measure was withdrawn after the Christian community and
 visiting Arab-American groups vigorously opposed it.
 The largely urbanized Chaldeans are the wealthiest and the best
 educated of the Christian groups. Deputy Prime Minister and
 Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz is a Chaldean. Other Chaldeans occupy
 mid-level Government positions. Syriac Christians are often found
 in the lower ranks of the civil service. Armenians are
 concentrated in private business. Because Assyrian Christians tend
 to be less educated and to have arrived more recently from rural
 areas, on the whole they are poorer than the other Christian groups.
 A 1981 law gave the Ministry of Endowment and Religious Affairs the
 authority to promulgate laws and regulations governing places of
 worship, appointment of clergy, religious literature, and
 participation in religious councils and meetings. Because of the
 potential authority this would give the Government over religious
 matters, the law caused concern among some religious leaders in
 Iraq and in the United States. Some Iraqi Christians have stated
 their belief that the law was designed to provide a legal mechanism
 for the Government to control the Shi'a. To date this law has not
 been invoked against the Christian sects, and a Government source
 indicated that the law would soon be amended in the areas found
 most objectionable by the religious leaders.
 The dominance of Islam in Iraq in itself places certain practical
 limitations on the freedoms of Christians and members of other
 religious minorities. For example, traditionally a Christian may
 convert to Islam, but he may not seek converts among Muslims, who
 are forbidden by their religion to apostatize. As a result,
 although there is no legal sanction of religious precepts, mixed
 marriages occur only infrequently. Such marriages virtually always
 involve a change in faith by the non-Muslim partner, who is almost
 always the woman. While the present regime generally has pursued a
 tolerant and secular policy in dealing with religious groups, past
 governments have been less tolerant, with the effect that many
 non-Muslims, especially Jews and Christians, left Iraq. Given the
 instability of Iraq's modern history, religious minorities fear a
 change in leadership which could well result in a return to the
 intolerance of the past.
 The Shi'a, who make up roughly 55 percent of the population, have
 traditionally been economically, politically, and socially
 disadvantaged. However, the Government has a declared policy to
 raise living standards and equalize opportunities for economic and
 professional advancement. In recent years, the Government and
 party have sought to promote Shi'a into positions of prominence.
 Evidence exists that the economic and social status of the Shi'a
 has improved markedly. Many of the well-to-do merchants in Iraq
 today are Shi'a. Nevertheless, the Government maintains a close
 watch on certain segments of the Shi'ite population against Iranian
 
 
 1277
 attempts to exploit any dissatisfaction and incite them to
 overthrow the Government. Certain circles of Shi'a clergy and
 laity were major targets of a campaign of arrests, executions, and
 expulsions following the Iranian inspired terrorist attacks on
 senior Government and Ba'ath Party officials in 1980. Shi'a clergy
 operate under close Government supervision and must submit Friday
 prayer sermons to the authorities for approval. The Government
 administers the principal Shi'a shrines. In an apparent attempt to
 win support from the devout, the Government has increased
 allotments to refurbish and maintain Shi'a shrines and Sunni
 mosques. Shi'a and Sunni religious officials receive government
 salaries.
 The Jewish community in Iraq is believed to number less than 400,
 down from 150,000 following World War II. The community was
 severely persecuted in the past, but there is no evidence of
 persecution in recent years. The extent of the community's
 religious activity is unknown. However, a Western journalist
 recently visited the last known synagogue in Baghdad and noted only
 a handful of people, mostly older men, attending services led by
 two rabbis.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel,
 Emigration, and Repatriation
 Iraqis are generally free to travel within the country and to
 change their residences or work places. However, they are likely
 to be constrained by social, cultural, and religious traditions
 which define the areas occupied by the various ethnic and religious
 groups within the country. Sensitive border and other security
 areas are off limits. Civilian travel in the war zone is
 restricted. Curfews are in effect on roads in the north where
 Kurdish insurgents have been active. There are police checkpoints
 on highways and outside major towns, but most Iraqis and foreigners
 travel freely in nonrestricted areas. Foreign diplomats must
 obtain permits from the foreign ministry for travel to areas
 outside of Baghdad, but these are usually granted when requested
 sufficiently in advance.
 All Iraqis and most foreigners who have remained in the country for
 more than two weeks must obtain exit permission to depart. Iraqi
 passports must be validated specifically for travel to the United
 States, following permission from the security authorities.
 Because of the war and the related drain on the economy, permission
 to travel abroad is restricted to a few categories of Iraqis,
 including officials, government-approved students, and persons
 needing medical treatment. Iraqis who have residences abroad may
 depart the country provided they originally had left before the war
 began. In general, a married woman must have the permission of her
 husband to travel abroad. The Government can require a prospective
 traveller to post a substantial bond to assure return. According
 to officials of the Ministry of Higher Education, while Iraqi
 students abroad should get permission before accepting foreign
 scholarships or grants, they would not be punished upon return to
 Iraq for failure to have done so. If students on Government
 scholarship abroad do not return, their families must repay the
 costs of the education.
 Even before travel restrictions went into effect, many Iraqis who
 wished to emigrate left the country surreptitiously. There is no
 specific ban on emigration nor special restrictions for members of
 minority groups; however, the practice is discouraged. Persons
 known to be seeking emigration have had travel permission delayed
 and have been harassed. Many emigrants leave behind substantial
 
 
 1278
 property because of the difficulty of transferring assets out of
 the country. Penalties for violating exchange laws can be severe.
 As a result of travel restrictions and other devices which
 discourage emigration, in 1983 only 41 Iraqis applied within Iraq
 for immigrant visas to the United States.
 In February 1980, the Revolutionary Command Council passed a
 resolution requiring alien spouses of Iraqi citizens who have
 resided in Iraq for at least five years to naturalize or to leave
 Iraq. The Government confiscates such aliens' residence permits
 until they naturalize. Many people, including several American
 women, have thus been forced to accept Iraqi citizenship. As Iraqi
 citizens subject to the present travel restrictions, these women
 are now unable to leave Iraq, even to visit family abroad, unless
 they happen to fall into one of the privileged categories.
 In recent years the Government has instituted special programs to
 encourage qualified professionals to return to Iraq. Aliens of
 Iraqi origin can apply for a document which will permit them to
 enter and exit Iraq without procuring a visa. Furthermore, former
 Iraqis can more easily obtain temporary visitors' visas than other
 aliens who generally must have an official sponsor in Iraq.
 Other groups, while not encouraged, are permitted to return to
 Iraq, including many individuals who left Iraq and were
 subsequently admitted to third countries as refugees. Large
 numbers of these, especially Assyrian Christians, have returned to
 Iraq on temporary visits. They are free to come and go, within the
 limits of the present travel restrictions, since they are not
 considered to have violated any Iraqi laws. Several of this group,
 however, have been unable to depart Iraq since they emigrated only
 after the beginning of the Iran-Iraq War. Among these are a number
 holding permanent residence in the U.S.
 Section 3   Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to
 Change Their Government
 Iraq is ruled by a small group of officials headed by Saddam
 Hussein. Most of the members of this group are linked by family
 roots in the town of Tikrit. This group rules by dominating the
 Ba'ath Party. The party has a large membership, but only some
 10,000 "active members" participate meaningfully in party
 activities. Political power is concentrated first in the Tikriti
 group, and then more widely among the Sunni Arabs. Shi'a and Kurds
 hold important positions, but not the most politically powerful
 ones.
 There are two other legal political parties, both Kurdish. They
 and the Ba'ath Party constitute the Patriotic and Progressive
 National Front, essentially a vehicle of support for the
 Government. The two non-Ba'ath parties carry on only limited
 activity. Members of the Iraqi military or security services may
 engage in political activities only within the Ba'ath Party.
 Membership in the party is not required for appointment to senior
 government positions, but normally is necessary to attain political
 influence. Opposition groups, including various Kurdish groups and
 splinter parties, are severely repressed. The Communist Party was
 removed from the Front and declared illegal in 1979. In 1982 the
 Government amnestied Iraqi Communists both in Iraq and abroad,
 although it is not known how many were released.
 The Iranian-supported, Shi'a religious-oriented al-Da'wa (Islamic
 Call) Party is outlawed and has been a major target of
 persecution. Membership in al-Dalwa bears the death penalty. The
 group has engaged in terrorist acts against the Government both
 
 
 1279
 internally and abroad. Al-Da'wa reportedly was implicated in the
 December, 1983 truck bombings of the U.S. Embassy and other
 American, French, and Kuwaiti targets in Kuwait.
 The first general elections since the overthrow of the monarchy in
 1958 were held in June 1980 to elect a National Assembly. Voters
 could choose from among many candidates, but the Government
 carefully screened all candidates before the campaign. Voter
 turnout among both sexes was heavy and 16 women were among the
 candidates elected. Members of the Assembly are not required to
 join the Ba'ath Party, but they must pledge allegiance to the
 principles of the Ba'ath Revolution. Mayors and provincial
 governors are appointed by the central Government.
 Section 4   Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-Government Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Iraq consistently has denied charges of human rights violations.
 Freedom House rates Iraq "not free." In addition, in its 1983
 report, Amnesty International criticized Iraq for torturing
 prisoners, deaths in detention, holding political prisoners,
 "disappearances," the lack of basic legal safeguards in the
 Revolutionary Court and Special Military Court, and a large number
 of executions.
 There is no office or individual within the Iraqi governmental
 structure charged with investigating human rights violations or
 with coordinating with other governments and international
 organizations on the general issue of human rights. However, "The
 Human Rights Society," a semi-official body of jurists and
 government officials, has an advisory role on such matters. The
 Society represents Iraq at international events concerned with
 human rights and played host to a visiting Amnesty International
 delegation.
 The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) delegate based
 in Iraq makes regular visits to Iranian prisoners of war and
 assisted in the repatriation of some 25 Iranian and Iraqi prisoners
 of war. On several occasions Iraq has received the ICRC President
 and other delegates to discuss the treatment of prisoners of war
 and the protection of civilians in the Iran-Iraq War. After his
 November 29 meeting with ICRC President Alexandre Hay, Foreign
 Minister Tariq Aziz stressed that Iraq is committed to observing
 the Geneva Convention in its treatment of Iranian prisoners of
 war. The Iraqi media announced that Mr. Hay was pleased with
 Iraq's cooperation with the ICRC on the prisoners of war.
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 Iraq's war with Iran, now into its fourth year, has had a serious
 impact on the Iraqi economy. Initially, the Government attempted
 to minimize the effects of the war, drawing down the country's
 substantial financial reserves and utilizing considerable sums of
 aid from Arab Gulf states. However, the war finally forced Iraq to
 slash expenditures and impose a policy of austerity on its people.
 The result has been a sharp reduction of imports, a virtual
 cessation of contracts for new projects, and growing shortages in
 the marketplace.
 Iraq's principal source of income is petroleum. Because of the
 war, Iraq's Persian Gulf oil outlets and its pipeline through Syria
 have been closed, leaving only the 750,000 barrels per day pipeline
 via Turkey. With oil exports down to one-fifth of their pre-war
 
 
 1280
 level, Iraq's trade balance changed from a $13 billion surplus in
 1980 to an approximate $8 billion deficit in 1981 and $9 billion
 deficit in 1982. This deficit may have narrowed significantly in
 1983 due to reductions in imports.
 Iraq has a centrally-controlled, nominally socialist economy.
 Major industries, including petroleum, are state-owned. Per capita
 gross national product (GNP) almost quintupled during the 1970's,
 rising from $630 to $3,021. Much of this increase, however,
 represented a pro rata share of accumulated foreign reserves
 resulting from higher oil prices. When oil earnings were cut
 sharply after the outbreak of the war, per capita GNP fell sharply
 ($1,742 in 1981). National income was said to have increased 34
 percent in 1982, but this can be attributed largely to inflation.
 Health care in Iraq is free or provided at a token fee. Although
 serious shortages of qualified personnel persist, medical
 professionals and workers increased from 9,000 in 1968 to over
 40,000 in 1980. The number of medical and nursing training
 institutions increased in the same period from three to 65. There
 was one doctor per 2,000 persons in 1980.
 Iraq's estimated population was 14,509,000 in 1983. Life
 expectancy at birth has increased from 51.7 years in 1969-71 to
 56.2 years in 1980. The infant mortality rate decreased to 81.0
 per 1,000 live births in 1983. These gains are due to improved
 health care and greatly increased urban and rural access to safe
 drinking water.
 Education is free through the university level. The Government
 offers scholarships for advanced study abroad, although numbers
 have decreased with the economic problems brought on by the war.
 In the last 10 years, enrollment in the number of primary and
 secondary schools has more than doubled. Female enrollment,
 especially at the primary level, largely accounted for the dramatic
 rise. The number of students in vocational schools and
 universities has increased markedly. The Government claims that
 implementation of the anti-illiteracy law of 1977 has raised Iraq's
 literacy rate to 70 percent.
 The land reform program ended the feudal system of the past but has
 not yet replaced it with a viable system. President Saddam Hussein
 abandoned a program to impose collective farms on the East European
 model in April 1981, and land has been returned to private
 ownership. Substantial funds for agricultural loans to individual
 families have been authorized.
 Heavy migration to the cities has resulted in substandard living
 conditions there. Numerous public housing projects are under
 construction. A system of subsidies and controls keeps the prices
 for most food staples, utilities, and transportation reasonably
 low, although prices in general are increasing sharply.
 The policies of the Ba'athist Government, as well as the impact of
 the war, have elevated the position of women in Iraqi society.
 Women's rights were recognized in 1979 when the Government changed
 laws to increase women's rights in divorce matters beyond those
 provided by Islamic tradition. Men must now go to court to obtain
 a divorce, and women now have the right to seek divorce from their
 husbands. The Government encourages Iraqi women to work in
 factories, banks, and government offices. Some have graduated from
 the Air Force Academy as fighter pilots.
