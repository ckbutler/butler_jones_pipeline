 BANGLADESH
 The Bangladesh Constitution provides for a presidential form
 of government and a unicameral Parliament of 300 members. The
 President appoints the ministers, 20 percent of whom do not
 have to be members of Parliament. The Prime Minister, also
 appointed by the President, serves more as the leader of the
 majority in Parliament than as leader of the Government. H.M.
 Ershad, then the Army Chief of Staff, took power in 1982 in a
 bloodless coup and was elected President in 1986 in an
 election boycotted by the major opposition parties.
 The present Parliament was elected in March under the state of
 emergency declared in November 1987 in the face of a
 succession of general strikes and opposition demonstrations
 calling for Ershad's ouster. Because prohibitions on
 political activity were not strictly enforced, the state of
 emergency apparently had little effect on the voting. The
 election, however, was boycotted by the major opposition
 parties which called for a strike during polling hours and was
 marred by low voter turnout, some violence, and voting
 irregularities. President Ershad's Jatiyo Party won 252 of
 300 seats, with the remaining 48 seats going to several small
 parties.
 President Ershad lifted the 138-day state of emergency on
 April 12, formally restoring fundamental constitutional
 rights. In practice, the Government had not strictly enforced
 prohibitions against public meetings and rallies under the
 state of emergency; opposition-sponsored demonstrations,
 rallies, and hartals (general strikes) generally proceeded
 without police action.
 A January rally in Chittagong was an exception; approximately
 20 persons were killed in a clash between police and
 opposition supporters. In addition, many opposition figures
 who had been arrested in late 1987 and then released were
 rearrested in early 1988 under the Special Powers Act (SPA) of
 1974, which permits detention without charge. Most detainees
 were released by mid-April.
 Internal security is maintained primarily by the police and
 the paramilitary forces, which are all under the control of
 the Home Affairs Ministry. The paramilitary forces include
 the Bangladesh Rifles, primarily responsible for border
 security, and the Bangladesh Ansars, a home guard which
 assists the police in maintaining law and order. The army has
 also undertaken operations in the Chittagong Hill Tracts
 against tribal insurgents. In 1988 the Shanti Bahini (peace
 force) insurgents killed at least 56 Bengali settlers in
 various raids. Unlike previous years, there were no reports
 of retaliation by security forces in the area.
 Bangladesh is one of the worla's poorest and most densely
 populated countries. The Government's key programs aim at
 economic development through reduced population growth,
 increased crop yields, decentralization of administration, and
 development of the private sector. Strikes by the political
 opposition in the first quarter of the year damaged the
 economy to some extent. Devastating flooding from June
 through September and a cyclone in November brought further
 economic hardship.
 The 1988 human rights situation improved over that of 1987.
 The state of emergency imposed in 1987 was lifted in 1988;
 
 
 1294
 BANGLADESH
 thousands of political detainees were released by year's end;
 developments in the Chittagong Hill Tracts showed a positive
 turn. Significant restrictions on civil liberties remained,
 however, including on freedom of the press, the right of
 citizens to change their government, and on a variety of
 women's rights.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 The longstanding insurgent movement remained active in the
 Chittagong Hill Tracts (CHT), where some 600,000 tribal people
 live, as clashes continued between Bengali settlers and small
 groups of armed tribal insurgents known as the Shanti Bahini
 (peace force). The insurgent movement, which began in the
 mid-1970s, has been sustained by the tribal people's fears
 that their traditional way of life and their special status in
 the hill areas are being undermined by settlers from the
 overpopulated plains. Government policy has succeeded in
 discouraging new settlers from moving into the hill tracts
 during the last 3 years. In fact, the number of nontribal
 settlers in the CHT has fallen substantially from 300,000 in
 1981 to approximately 160,000 remaining today.
 Shanti Bahini attacks on Bengali settlements and military
 personnel, many of which resulted in death and destruction of
 property, continued in 1988. Despite efforts by the
 Government's National Committee on the Tribal Area (NCTA) to
 reach an accommodation with the Shanti Bahini and to
 facilitate the return of tribal refugees from camps in India,
 the Shanti Bahini began raiding Bengali settlers again in
 April. Reportedly, at least 34 people died in those raids,
 and 22 more were killed in July. Unlike in the past,
 government security forces have apparently refrained from
 retaliating against the tribal population for these raids.
 Approximately 1,500 tribal refugees are reported to have
 returned from refugee camps in India during 1988.
 In late January, the Government allowed a three-member Amnesty
 International (AI) mission to visit Bangladesh to discuss AI's
 concerns over alleged human rights abuses with Government
 officials. During its 6-day visit, which included 2 days in
 the Chittagong Hill Tracts, the AI delegation met with high
 Government officials, security forces commanders, and members
 of the National Committee on the Tribal Area (NCTA). In its
 March 1988 report, "Bangladesh: Report of a Mission
 Concerning Human Rights Violatibtns in the Chittagong Hill
 Tracts, 24-30 January 1988," Al reported receiving firm
 assurances from the Government that security forces are under
 strict instructions to avoid reprisals against the tribal
 people and to prevent others from such retaliation. There is
 no evidence that this policy is being violated. Complaints of
 human rights violations in the Hill Tracts appeared to be far
 fewer than those received as recently as 1986 and early 1987.
 AI observed that the instructions, and the importance attached
 to them by government officials, may have done much to enhance
 the protection of the basic rights of the tribal people and
 helped promote some confidence in the Government's commitment
 to their full security.
 
 
 1295
 BANGLADESH
 Several deaths occurred during the political unrest of early
 1988. On January 24 in the port city of Chittagong, clashes
 between police and opposition (Awami League and Eight-Party
 Alliance) supporters who had gathered for a rally resulted in
 a number of civilian casualties. No reliable casualty figures
 exist, but most sources put the toll between 17 and 22 dead.
 The official tally was 8 deaths, but the opposition estimated
 that 35 to 70 people died. The Government announced an
 official inquiry, but the results have not been released.
 Fighting between rival candidates and their supporters in
 several districts also resulted in deaths in a local election
 held on February 10 when 150 people were killed and 8,000
 injured. During the March 3 parliamentary elections the level
 of violence was considerably lower than that in February.
 Between 5 and 13 people were reportedly killed and between 100
 and 300 injured during election day clashes. Sporadic
 violence, including occasional deaths, continued on university
 campuses in 1988, particularly between student wings of
 various political parties.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no confirmed reports of disappearance resulting
 from official actions in 1988. As in the past, however, armed
 tribal insurgents in the.Chittagong Hill Tracts reportedly
 kidnaped persons in raids on Bengali villages.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 The Constitution forbids torture and cruel, inhuman, or
 degrading punishment and treatment. Early in 1988, there were
 two reported incidents of alleged torture of tribal villagers
 by security forces in the Chittagong Hill Tracts. A
 government inquiry produced no evidence to substantiate these
 allegations. AI and local human rights groups continue to
 monitor the Hill Tracts area and have strongly encouraged the
 Government to safeguard the rights of tribal people.
 Police treatment of accused criminals is often rough and can
 include abusive interrogations and beatings. Reports of
 fatalities from such mistreatment are rare. Mistreatment of
 ordinary citizens frequently goes unpunished, but punishment
 of police and jail officials involved in mistreating prisoners
 may sometimes take place in cases where the victim or his
 friends and family can attract publicity. In September, a
 police inspector and four subinspectors were sentenced to 10
 years' rigorous imprisonment and fined for beating an accused
 criminal to death in October 1986.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Under the SPA of 1974, the Fome Affairs Ministry can detain an
 individual without charge for an initial period of 1 month to
 prevent him from committing "any prejudicial act." By the end
 of this period, the Government is obligated to charge a
 detainee formally. If it fails to file a charge, the detention
 is considered "illegal" and the detainee is released.
 However, if the Government brings a charge, the individual can
 be held until completion of an investigation. In practice,
 though not in the law, the detainee has 15 days to respond to
 the specific charge in writing to the Home Affairs Ministry.
 The Ministry can then grant early release. The detention
 order is not reviewed by a judge. After 6 months, a review
 
 
 1296
 BANGLADESH
 committee of three jurists examines the case to ascertain if
 there is sufficient reason to continue the detention. The
 detained person has the theoretical right to see a lawyer at
 the time he is detained. In practice, however, a lawyer is
 generally not allowed~to see the detainee until a specific
 charge has been filed.
 Detentions under the SPA of 1974, which was invoked widely in
 1987, continued into the first quarter of 1988. Al noted in
 its February 1988 report, "Large-Scale Detention Without Trial
 of Opposition Members: July 1987-February 1988," that the
 frequency of arrests for nonviolent political activity had
 decreased after late November 1987. In February, however, the
 number of SPA detentions briefly rose in the wake of violence
 during local elections. Several hundred persons, including
 some senior and well-known leaders of the opposition, were
 jailed under the SPA in February. Most detainees were
 subsequently released in phases beginning in late February.
 With the release of 272 prisoners in April, the Home Affairs
 Ministry claimed that all SPA detainees from late 1987 and
 early 1988 had either been released or charged with specific
 offenses, as required by the law. In June the Ministry
 announced that 1,320 persons detained under the SPA had been
 charged with such criminal offenses as the use of arms and
 manufacture of explosives.
 The right of a detainee to a judicial determination of the
 legality of his detention exists in local law. Bangladeshi
 legal and human rights organizations, however, continued to
 report cases of suspects who were arrested on minor charges
 but who remained in jail for long periods without trial.
 There were no reports of persons being exiled in 1988.
 With regard to forced or compulsory labor, see Section 6.c.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Civil and criminal cases are heard by civilian courts in
 public trials, and the right of counsel is respected. Civil
 courts, though overburdened and effectively available only to
 those who can afford representation, are generally considered
 fair. However, the time-consuming and expensive process of
 pursuing cases discourages many from seeking redress through
 the courts. There are few legal aid programs to assist
 litigants and no public defenders. As of late 1988, over
 500,000 criminal and civil cases were pending adjudication.
 Despite a time limit of 240 days for disposal of criminal
 cases at the district level and 120 days at the magistrate's
 level, longer delays were common.
 In June the Constitution was amended to establish permanent
 benches of the High Court division in six regional cities,
 thus affording better service to the majority of the
 population, which resides outside Dhaka. Opponents of the
 measure, including the Supreme Court Bar Association and many
 Dhaka lawyers, criticized the amendment, claiming that it was
 unconstitutional and that decentralization of the High Court
 would diminish its prestige. A 1-day-a-week boycott of the
 Supreme Court by critics of this measure, combined with an
 acute shortage of judges and inadequate training of new
 judges, tampered the timely dispensation of justice even
 further. With funding from the Asia Foundation and the U.S.
 Government, a Bangladeshi nonprofit human rights group has
 established a training program for new lawyers. The Ministry
 of Law and Justice, the Supreme Court, and the Asia Foundation
 
 
 1297
 BANGLADESH
 plan a similar program to train new judges. The judiciary is
 generally considered independent, although pressure is
 sometimes brought to bear in political or security cases. In
 1988 the Supreme Court ruled against the Government in two
 cases of illegal detention.
 Bangladeshi human rights groups do not maintain statistics on
 the number of political prisoners in the country, and estimates
 vary widely. Persons detained under the Special Powers Act of
 1974 (SPA) often are subsequently charged under criminal
 statutes.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Bangladesh law requires a judicial warrant before authorities
 enter a home, and courts require evidence supporting a
 reasonable suspicion before issuing a warrant. However, the
 SPA does permit authorities to search premises without a
 warrant under certain circumstances. Authorities have in the
 past entered the homes of opposition leaders, detained
 individuals, and searched their premises without warrants.
 The Government's civilian, and military intelligence services
 are thought by the opposition to monitor it by such means as
 selective wiretaps and interception of mail.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press..
 The Bangladesh Constitution provides for freedom of speech and
 expression and freedom of the press, subject to "reasonable
 restrictions" in the interest of national security,
 international relations, and public order, decency, and
 morality. In practice, the Government has a variety of means
 to attempt to control the press, including formal and informal
 censorship, temporary closures of newspapers, and arrest or
 intimidation of journalists.. The SPA allows the Government to
 ban domestic publications, to hold any newspaper employee
 responsible for the paper's content, and to compel journalists
 to reveal news sources. Most publications are financially
 dependent upon advertisements from the Government or
 government-owned corporations. These advertisements
 reportedly account for as much as 75 percent of advertising
 revenues. All newspapers are eligible to receive public
 sector advertising if they meet minimum circulation
 requirements. Publishers complain that placing or withholding
 advertising is often used as a means of influencing the press.
 Under the state of emergency which was in effect from November
 27, 1987, until April 12, 1988, press restrictions were
 instituted whfch forbade printers, publishers, and editors of
 all newspapers from criticizing directly or indirectly any
 government decision or order. These restrictions were relaxed
 after approximately 2 weeks, and government newspapers began
 to carry statements by opposition leaders on December 11,
 1987. Although the opposition's views and activities
 continued to receive daily coverage in most newspapers, news
 management in the form of guidance from the Information
 Ministry on how to report a story, government control of most
 advertising revenue, and occasional bans on publications
 reminded the opposition and the press that criticism of the
 Covernment has to remain within parameters set by the
 Government. In 1988 four Bengali-language weeklies--which
 tend to be censored more heavily than dailies--were banned for
 
 
 1298
 BANGLADESH
 "objectionable" statements or commentary: Desh Bandhu and
 Prohar were banned in January, Bichinta in February, and
 Robbar in June for the second time in 8 months. Other
 publications banned in 1988 included two issues of Ekota and
 two editions of the London-based Natun Din. The right-of-
 center opposition daily Inqilab was banned under the SPA in
 September but was permitted to resume publication in October.
 A number of other publications banned in previous years
 remained closed in 1988. However, two pro-Awami League
 newspapers Khobar and Banglar Bani, which had been banned in
 1987, were allowed to resume publication in April and October,
 respectively. The British Broadcasting Corporation's Dhaka
 office, which had been temporarily closed, was permitted to
 reopen in May.
 The Government owns and operates all radio and television
 facilities. In the print media, it owns three Dhaka
 newspapers, including one English-language daily, one
 Bengali-language daily, and one Bengali-language weekly. The
 Government also owns BSS, the national news service. An
 independent wire service, ENA, is privately owned. All
 newspapers must be approved and licensed by the Government to
 be eligible to purchase newsprint and obtain government
 advertising.
 Dhaka has 70 dailies and 277 weeklies. Three of the Dhaka
 English-language dailies and most Bengali-language periodicals
 and newspapers are privately owned and reflect the views of
 various political parties. All major newspapers report on
 both government and opposition activities, although coverage
 of the opposition is somewhat less extensive in the government
 -owned publications. In 1988 most newspapers covered news of
 hartals (general strikes) and the activities of opposition
 political leaders. Articles and editorials critical of the
 Government do appear, but criticism of the person of President
 Ershad, his family, or the armed forces is not tolerated. One
 publication, the weekly Robbar, was banned on June 16 after
 printing commentary critical of the President.
 Several journalists were detained in 1988. The editor of the
 weekly Bichinta, which was banned in February, was detained
 because of a front-page cartoon critical of President Ershad.
 The Dhaka correspondent for a Chittagong weekly was arrested
 later the same month, but his detention was thought to be for
 political rather than journalistic activities. Both persons
 were later released. The publisher of Robbar and three of its
 journalists were arrested in June after publication of an
 article critical of the President's personal life. They were
 later released on bail by a High Court order. A suit
 challenging the Government's ban on Robbar is pending.
 Opposition political parties also exert pressure on hostile
 newspapers and magazines in efforts to intimidate them.
 Tactics employed include anonymous threatening telephone calls
 and even arson.
 Several foreign newspapers and magazines are available. The
 Customs Act of 1969 permits the Government to prevent the
 importation of foreign publications, and -the Government has
 occasionally used this provision to block the sale of
 publications critical of President Ershad. In 1988 the Act
 was invoked to block two issues of the London-based
 Bengali-language weekly Natun Din. Several foreign
 journalists who sought to cover the March 3 parliamentary
 election experienced difficulties in obtaining visas.
 
 
 1299
 BANGLADESH
 The Government retains the authority to require drama groups
 to obtain certificates of approval to perform. No drama group
 in Dhaka applies for such authorization in practice, but the
 law is enforced outside the capital. Drama groups are required
 to submit scripts to the district commissioner, and actors who
 perform in unauthorized plays are theoretically subject to
 arrest.
 Censorship laws regarding films are generally enforced in
 Dhaka. Theater owners submit films to the Censor Board, which
 also screens films shown by foreign cultural institutions.
 The Board makes no attempt to censor videotapes. The import
 of foreign films for private screening is permitted; however,
 laws designed to protect the local film industry limit the
 import of such films by commercial theaters. No South African
 or Israeli film may be shown.
 Students are generally free to expLess a wide range of
 political opinion through campus organizations and
 publications. Opposition parties sometimes take advantage of
 th& relatively greater freedom enjoyed on campus by using
 student fronts to organize antigovernment demonstrations.
 These events occasionally turn violent.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Constitution assures every citizen the right to form
 associations, subject to "reasonable restrictions" in the,
 interest of morality or public order. In practice,
 individuals are free tor join'private organizations and
 associations, and permits are generally not required for
 public meetings. Freedom of assembly was legally
 circumscribed by the state of emergency which existed until
 April, but prohibitions on processions, rallies, and
 demonstrations were not strictly enforced even when they were
 in effect. There are no restrictions on affiliation with
 international organizations.
 For a discussion of freedom of association as it applies to
 labor unions, see Section 6.a.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 With the passage of the Eighth Amendment to the Bangladesh
 Constitution in June, Islam was recognized as the state
 religion in Bangladesh, 87 percent of whose people are
 Muslims. The amendment states that all other religions may be
 freely practiced, a policy which has been substantially
 respected. Government policy continues to permit various
 religions to establish places of worship and to train clergy.
 Conversion is possible, although there is strong social
 resistance to efforts to convert people from Islam.
 Proselytizing by Bangladeshi citizens, which is permitted
 under the Constitution, is mostly directed toward such
 minority groups as Hindus and tribal people. Missionaries,
 including foreign clergy serving expatriate congregations, are
 permitted in Bangladesh. Religious travel and links with
 coreliqionists abroad are also permitted.
 Despite the official policy assuring freedom of religion and
 equality of treatment, the establishment of Islam as the state
 religion contributed to increased concern among the Hindu,
 Christian, and Buddhist minorities. Though the Government
 denies any attempt to reduce the number of Christian
 missionaries, for years some have experienced delays in having
 
 
 1300
 BANGLADESH
 their Bangladesh visas renewed. Other groups occasionally
 face attempts to reduce their visa allocation. Appeals to the
 Home Affairs Ministry sometimes have been successful in such
 cases. There have been isolated incidents of harassment and
 acts of vandalism against minority religious groups, but there
 is no evidence that such actions have been instigated or
 encouraged by the Government. A Hindu temple was ransacked
 and two churches were burned by a mob in Narayanganj. A
 Christian group in another district reported difficulty
 securing a building permit for a new church. In Faridpur in
 March, vandals smashed a stained glass window in the Baptist
 church. There were reports in Magura of an attack against the
 pastor's wife and other Bangladeshi Christians. The
 Government launched investigations, but no results had been
 announced by year's end.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Bangladeshi citizens are free to move about within the
 country, except in designated areas of the Chittagong Hill
 Tracts. There are also border areas from which foreigners are
 banned. Bangladeshis are generally free to visit and emigrate
 abroad, subject to foreign exchange controls. In March,
 however, during the state of emergency, a prominent opposition
 activist was temporarily barred from leaving the country.
 Civil servants wishing to travel abroad must obtain
 "no-objection" certificates from the Ministry responsible for
 manpower export. During the September flood emergency, all
 foreign travel was banned for government employees, including
 for the staff of such autonomous institutions as the
 universities. Exemptions required approval from the
 President's Secretariat. In some instances, persons
 considered to be security risks are barred from traveling
 abroad. The Government does not hinder citizens who wish to
 return home from abroad. The right of repatriation is
 observed.
 Approximately 250,000 non-Bengali Muslims, known as the
 Biharis or "stranded Pakistanis," remain in Bangladesh pending
 resettlement in Pakistan. After independence in 1971, these
 persons opted for Pakistani citizenship. Pakistan eventually
 agreed to accept them, provided financing for resettlement
 costs was made available from outside sources. A Saudi
 Arabia-based Islamic social organization has been trying for
 several years to raise money for resettlement costs, but has
 not yet been able to raise the full amount required. Camp
 dwellers may seek employment and conduct other activities, but
 face disadvantages as noncitizens. Some Biharis have lost
 property as a result of laws confiscating Pakistani holdings,
 but those who choose to become Bangladeshi citizens are
 granted full rights of citizenship. Biharis may apply for
 Bangladeshi citizenship at any time.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 The governing party's dominance of the electoral process and
 the fraud and violence which have characterized recent
 elections raise serious doubts about the ability of Bangladeshi
 citizens to change their government peacefully and
 democratically. In addition, the political polarization
 between the Government and the opposition continued to prevent
 their agreement on the holding of free elections.

 BANGLADESH
 Bangladesh's current leader, H.M. Ershad, became President in
 an election in 1986 in which the major opposition groupings,
 including the Awami League/Eight-Party Alliance, the
 Bangladesh Nationalist Party, and the Islamic fundamentalist
 Jamaat-E-Islami, did not participate. Although he continued
 his efforts in 1988 to broaden his popular support as a
 constitutional, civilian president, the military remains his
 main power base.
 Amid political unrest and civil disorder in late 1987,
 President Ershad dissolved the Parliament. As required by the
 Constitution, new elections were held within 90 days.
 Nationwide polling took place on March 3 despite & state of
 emergency, which had been declared on November 27, 1987, as a
 result of-unprecedented opposition efforts to oust President
 Ershad. The state of emergency itself apparently had little
 effect on the polling.
 In March parliamentary elections, President Ershad's Jatiyo
 Party won 252 of 300 seats. The remaining 48 seats went to
 small parties, of which the Combined Opposition Party (COP),
 with 18 seats, was the largest. Th major opposition parties,
 including the Awami League and the Bangladesh Nationalist
 Party, boycotted the election and staged a 36-hour general
 strike in an attempt to disrupt the balloting. Claiming that
 less than 1 percent of eligible voters had participated,
 opposition leaders demanded new elections under a neutral,
 caretaker government. The flawed parliamentary elections in
 March and violent local elections in February, in which
 approximately 150 people died in clashes between supporters of
 rival candidates, were widely perceived as a setback to hopes
 for genuine democracy.
 The newly elected Parliament opened its first session on April
 25, shortly after the state of emergency was lifted on April
 12. The Parliament sat for 78 days and passed an unprecedented
 38 bills, including a controversial constitutional amendment
 to make Islam the state religion. In late April, President
 Ershad responded to criticism of the election by appointing a
 respected justice to function as a one-member Commission on
 Electoral Reform. The justice, charged with examining the
 electoral process and proposing alternatives, was dismissed on
 June 3 after he briefed the press on his critical findings
 before submitting them to the Government. His findings,
 originally due on June 30, were never published.
 Rumors of a new electoral reform commission and possible new
 elections continued to be heard in the latter half of 1988,
 but attention to political issues was deflected by the
 record-breaking summer floods and their aftermath. Under the
 Constitution, new parliamentary elections are not required
 before 1993. Female participation in political life is
 incipient. Four women are members of Parliament; the two
 major opposition parties are headed by women.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 In January 1988, a three-member delegation from Amnesty
 International (AI) visited Bangladesh to discuss AI's concerns
 about human rights violations in the Chittagong Hill Tracts.
 During a 6-day visit, the delegation met with President Ershad
 and other high government officials, traveled to the Chittagong
 Hill Tracts, and discussed human rights issues with local
 
 
 1302
 BANGLADESH
 military commanders and the National Committee on the Tribal
 Area. In its March 1988 report on the mission, AI expressed
 appreciation for the Government's extensive cooperation but
 called on it to conduct impartial and thorough investigations
 into allegations of past abuse.
 The International Labor Organization (ILO) Committee on
 Application of Conventions and Recommendations in 1987 devoted
 a special paragraph to Bangladesh with regard to Convention
 107 (Treatment of Indigenous and Tribal Peoples). In April a
 delegation from the ILO visited Bangladesh to discuss actions
 taken by the Government with regard to treatment of tribal
 peoples in the Chittagong Hill Tracts. The ILO also received
 cooperation from the Government.
 International organizations represented in Bangladesh include
 the International League for Human Rights, the Law Association
 for Asia and the Western Pacific, and the International
 Commission of Jurists. There are also a number of local human
 rights organizations which monitor developments and investigate
 allegations of abuse. Bangladesh is a member of the U.N.
 Commission on Human Rights.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Underlying attitudes and social barriers circumscribing the
 participation of women in activities beyond the home are
 strongly entrenched and show few signs of weakening. For the
 approximately 86 percent of Bangladeshi women who live in
 rural areas, early marriage, high child-bearing rates, and
 long hours of household labor leave little opportunity for
 nonfamily interests or outside employment. Even in urban
 areas and among the affluent, the traditional social system
 makes women economically dependent upon their husbands
 and other male relatives. By custom and Islamic tradition,
 women occupy a subordinate place in society. The ability of a
 family to seclude its women is a symbol of middle or high
 social status. Women are virtually absent from the cash-
 earning work force, except in the export-oriented garment
 industry. A woman's income is considered "supplemental" to
 her husband's, and women are normally employed in different
 occupations from those in which men are employed. Even for
 similar work, women are frequently paid lower wages.
 The daily press testifies to a pattern of domestic violence
 against women: murder; rape and other physical abuse; breach
 of matrimonial contract; denial of inheritance rights; and
 desertion. The suicide rate among women is reportedly almost
 three times higher than among men. The Government promulgated
 a stringent ordinance in 1983 to deter such cruelties as
 trafficking in women, murder, kidnaping, and abduction. A law
 passed in 1988 adds trafficking in women to the list of
 offenses punishable by death. The death penalty is also
 imposed against those directly responsible for "dowry-killing"
 or for killing a woman in the course of rape. Dowry killings
 share a common theme: the bride's family has not made full
 payment of a supposedly promised dowry, so the husband or his
 family attacks and sometimes murders the bride. There is
 little recourse for abused women, especially for crimes within
 the family or home.
 Members of minority religious groups are disadvantaged in
 practice, though not in the law, in their access to government
 jobs and political office. In the years immediately following
 
 
 1303
 BANGLADESH
 Bangladesh's independence, members of some minorities,
 principally Hindus, lost or had serious difficulty retaining
 their properties as a result of the prejudicial administration
 of vested property laws. These laws permit the Government to
 use and even sell property belonging to persons who left what
 is now Bangladesh between 1965 and 1971.
 Reports also persist that the property rights of tribal
 peoples are being violated. Until 1985, tribal land, for
 which there is frequently no deed, was parceled out by
 Bangladesh authorities to Bengali Muslim settlers. Over the
 past decade, successive governments encouraged the settlement
 of approximately 300,000 ethnic Bengalis in the Chittagong
 Hill Tracts. There have been no new settlements for the past
 3 years, and reports indicate that the number of settlers has
 dropped to 160,000. Tribal people also face loss of land
 through false deeds, physical attacks, or failure to meet
 mortgage payments. The army can take land without compensation
 in areas where the tribal insurgency is active, but there was
 no report of such confiscation in 1988. The National Committee
 on the Tribal Area (NCTA) has also proposed plans to assist
 the tribal people in their area's development, including
 housing, hospitals, and schools. The NCTA is also considering
 a program to reserve a certain number of jobs in the Chittagong
 Hill Tracts administration for tribal people.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 The right of association is found in the Constitution, subject
 to restrictions imposed by law. Workers in trade associations
 or unions may draw up their own constitution and rules, elect
 officers, develop programs, and conduct business without
 government interference. There are no restrictions on joining
 confederations or affiliating with international organizations.
 Union members need governmental clearance to travel to
 international labor meetings, but such clearances are usually
 granted.
 The right to strike is not recognized in the law but is an
 accepted form of protest in Bangladesh. Strikes occurred in
 1988. The Essential Services Ordinance of 1958 permits the
 Government to bar strikes for 3 months in any sector deemed
 *essential." Labor unions represent only 3 percent of the
 work force, a reflection of the low level of industrialization.
 Nevertheless, unions are powerful and important in such
 sectors as jute, tea, and transportation. Most labor unions
 and federations are associated with a political party. Union
 activities are more often in response to the demands of
 political patrons than in response to the needs of the
 members. Unions are often involved in politics but generally
 have little real influence. The Workers-Employees United
 Council (SKOP), the largest trade union federation, is
 sympathetic to the opposition. Bangladesh is a member of the
 ILO.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 The Constitution provides for the right to form labor unions,
 but the Government has the legal right to suspend them. No
 unions were suspended in 1988. By law, workers have a limited
 right to collective bargaining. Public sector employees
 cannot form unions or bargain collectively. Except in the
 Chittagong Export Processing Zone, where union activity has
 
 
 1304
 BANGLADESH
 been suspended since 1985, unions in the private sector can
 generally bargain collectively without government interference.
 There is no formal process of mediation.
 In theory, workers have participatory rights in union business,
 but these rights are often violated in practice by both union
 leaders and employers. Laws against antiunion discrimination
 are also frequently violated, and the difficulties of
 prosecuting a court case against an employer discourage unions'
 attempts to have them enforced. Workers are frequently fired
 from their jobs for union activities, and union leaders are
 sometimes harassed. Antiunion discrimination is especially
 prevalent in the garment industry, where the majority of the
 work force is female.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 There is no forced or compulsory labor in Bangladesh. Such
 labor is barred by the Constitution.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 The Employment of Children Act prohibits the offering of
 employment to any person under 14 years of age, but the Act is
 not enforced. Sanctioned by tradition and encouraged by dire
 economic necessity, child labor is a serious problem. Minimum
 ages for various types of employment are set by law, but these
 minimums are seldom enforced. The poverty of the country is
 such that children are regularly engaged in all available
 jobs. The Bureau of Labor Statistics estimated the number of
 child laborers at approximately 3 million in 1986. These
 children pedaled rickshaws, served as domestic servants,
 worked as helpers in transport services, carried loads at
 railway stations and river terminals, labored at construction
 sites, and were employed in great numbers in agriculture.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 Regulations regarding minimum wages, hours of work, and
 occupational safety and health are not strictly enforced.
 Income levels average $1 to $2 per day and, in 1985, the
 minimum wage was $.07 per hour. These levels are insufficient
 to afford a family a decent standard of living. The Factories
 Act of 1965 and the Shops and Establishments Act of 1965 limit
 normal working hours to a maximum of 8 hours per day and 48
 hours per week. With overtime, the workweek may not exceed 60
 hours. Although the law stipulates that overtime work is to
 be compensated by double the hourly rate, overtime pay
 practices do not conform to legal requirements. Safety
 equipment and precautions are largely unknown. Bangladesh has
 a small number of safety inspectors, but they are frequently
 untrained and underpaid.
