 GUINEA
 The human rights situation has improved in the Republic of
 Guinea since a change in government on April 3, 1984, and
 after the death in March of long-time President Ahmed Sekou
 Toure, who had controlled the previous one-party "socialist'
 state since 1958. The country is now ruled by a 20-man
 Military Committee for National Redressment (CMRN). Upon
 seizing power April 3, 1984, the CMRN abolished Toure's
 Democratic Party of Guinea and the Constitution, and named a
 President (Lansana Conte), a Prime Minister, and a cabinet of
 33 military and 8 civilians. (In a reorganization December
 18, 1984, the Office of the Prime Minister was abolished and
 the Cabinet and CMRN reduced in numbers.) Members of the
 various armed forces were named to principal offices at the
 regional and sub-regional levels. Citizens have subsequently
 been invited to organize representative councils at the local
 level. Although the CMRN has indicated that a new
 constitution will be provided, there are no immediate plans to
 allow the formation of political parties or return to civilian
 rule.
 The previous regime had imprisoned without trial and executed
 many Guineans over a period of years, including up to the time
 of the coup. Torture of prisoners was commonplace and
 thousands simply disappeared. Toward the end, Toure had begun
 to relax controls on several aspects of Guinea's political and
 social life beginning in the late 1970's. A generat amnesty
 of all Guinean exiles had been declared in July 1977, and
 thousands of emigrants returned to Guinea. However,
 immediately after the coup, the military government released
 250 political prisoners, mainly from Camp Boiro, the principal
 political detention center, and permitted reporters to describe
 the heinous conditions and practices, including standard tiny
 concrete cells and the 'black diet' (total deprivation of food
 and water). The new military Government invited Amnesty
 International to interview former political detainees in the
 early fall (report not yet available), and signed an
 'instrument of adherence by the Republic of Guinea to the
 Geneva Conventions of August 12, 1949, (plus additional
 protocols) on Civil and Political Rights. It also announced
 its intent to adhere to the Universal Declaration of Human
 Rights.
 Guinea is a resource-rich but economically underdeveloped
 country. Its agricultural sector, which produces mostly at
 subsistence levels, provides livelihood for over 80 percent of
 the population and contributes 40 percent of the gross domestic
 product. The modern sector consists of a few mining enclaves,
 which generate nearly all of Guinea's foreign exchange, and a
 variety of uneconomic state-owned industrial, agro-industrial,
 and commercial enterprises. The previous regime had undertaken
 cautious steps toward reform of an economy that consisted of
 these uneconomic state-owned institutions and declining
 agricultural production resulting from state-owned collective
 farms, but inflation and balance of payments difficulties
 persisted.
 The new Government has abolished the agricultural collective
 farms and is investigating the possibility of returning some
 of the state-owned enterprises to the private sector. It has
 invited the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and
 other international and bilateral donors to provide technical
 and material assistance for restructuring the economy,
 
 
 142
 GUINEA
 strengthening the currency, rescheduling foreign debt,
 developing an investment code, and reversing the unfavorable
 balance of payments.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 Since the bloodless coup in April 1984, there were no reported
 instances of politically motivated killings in Guinea.
 However, prior to the coup, the Toure regime continued up to
 the end the practice of jailing political prisoners without
 trial, and political killings may have taken place in the
 first months of 1984. A New York Times correspondent visited
 Camp Boiro after the coup and described a variety of harsh
 prison conditions and practices, including use of the 'black
 diet" to kill prisoners. The Times article estimated that
 several thousand had died at Camp Boiro during Toure's regime.
 b. Disappearance
 Amnesty International in its 1984 report (covering 1983)
 stressed the Toure Government's continued failure to account
 for a large number of political detainees, estimated at 2,900,
 who had simply 'disappeared" from custody in previous years.
 These detainees included some of the leading professionals,
 senior government and military officials, lawyers, teachers,
 and medical personnel. With the advent of the new Government
 in April, there were no reported instances of disappearance in
 Guinea during the remainder of 1984. At the invitation of the
 postcoup Government, Amnesty International visited Guinea
 during October 1984 to search for more information on the
 earlier disappearances.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Upon coming to power in April 1984, the CMRN condemned the
 previous regime for cruel and inhuman treatment of prisoners,
 allowed the international press to visit Camp Boiro and
 interview former prisoners, and pledged henceforth to abolish
 such practices and adhere to the international charter of
 human rights. Subsequent reports in the national and
 international press documented in detail the cruel and inhuman
 treatment accorded prisoners and detainees, when the new
 government opened Camp Boiro to public inspection. Amnesty
 International also noted that torture and other forms of
 ill-treatment took place on a regular basis, and many died as
 a result of she 'black diet' or of malnutrition and disease.
 The only form of abuse reported since the coup is occasional
 beating of suspects in police stations after arrest. In one
 such case, when the suspect died, the policemen involved were
 arrested, tried, and sentenced to prison.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Amnesty International estimated in its 1984 report that, under
 the Toure Government, the number of political detainees at any
 one time at Camp Boiro, the main detention center, averaged
 about 200 persons. Most stayed for several months and then
 
 
 143
 GUINEA
 were released or moved to another prison. Many people had
 been detained merely for expressing some form of dissent from
 party policy.
 An ordinance signed August 15, 1984, contained provisions for
 reorganizing the Guinean judicial system following
 recommendations of a national conference on justice. Precise
 details concerning arbitrary arrest and detention are not yet
 known. In the several cases of robbery, murder, and drug
 smuggling that have been publicized, the time elapsing between
 arrests, holding of trials, and passing of judgments has
 appeared reasonable.
 The only known cases of detention without a judicial
 determination of the legality of detention are those of former
 government leaders, some family members, and members of the
 military who reportedly attempted a countercoup shortly after
 the April 3 coup. The precise number is unknown. President
 Lansana Conte has announced publicly that these prisoners will
 be put on trial but has not given a timetable. He has stated
 the CMRN is proceeding slowly in its investigations *to avoid
 inflicting any unmerited punishments on anyone.*
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Amnesty International pointed out that those detained by the
 previous regime for political reasons were afforded no
 protection by the judicial structure. None detained in 1983
 was believed to have been charged or tried by the court. The
 New York Times article reported that 153 prisoners were
 sentenced to Camp Boiro in 1983 and 95 more in the first three
 months of 1984.
 The newly reorganized judicial system is independent with
 courts of first instance at the subprefecture and prefecture
 levels, courts of appeal at the provincial level and a supreme
 court at the national level. There also are to be juvenile
 courts, a labor court, and a military tribunal. Judges are to
 be appointed on the basis of their qualifications instead of
 political credentials as was the previous practice. Private
 legal practice has been restored and legal assistance is to be
 provided the poor to ensure that everyone will have the
 benefit of fair trials. The Government is also in the process
 of revising various legal codes. Until the reorganization is
 completed, and the new legal system is in full operation, it
 is not possible to judge its effectiveness.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 correspondence
 The labor, women's, and youth organizations of the previous
 party-state, in which all government employees felt obliged to
 participate, were abolished by the CMRN. These organizations,
 together with the entire education system, had been concerned
 with organizing classes in ideology and providing civic
 education. The education system is now being reorganized to
 eliminate ideology. Postgraduate seminars in party ideology
 previously required of all university graduates and a 6-9 week
 militia *boot camp' have been replaced by one-year compulsory
 military training for all graduates, men and women alike.
 Judicial codes and practices are in the process of being
 revised, and provisions relating to entry and search of homes
 have not yet been issued. Censorship of international mail,
 
 
 144
 GUINEA
 which existed under the previous government, appears to have
 ceased.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Government owns and operates all Guinean media. A statute
 permitting nongovernment publications is pending. Until April
 1984, criticism of the Government was rarely allowed and
 journalists generally confined their reporting to accounts of
 government activities and development issues. Foreign books,
 newspapers and journals were rarely available in Guinea and
 censorship or printed material existed.
 Since April 1984, the new Government has been vigorously
 engaged in promoting freedom of speech and press. However,
 given the nature of the Government and the lack of tradition
 in Guinea for freely ventilating opposition viewpoints,
 inhibitions still appear to exist in this area. In regard to
 criticism of the Government, CMRN members have asked for
 "constructive" criticism by Guinean citizens. Films, as well
 as publications distributed by diplomatic missions in Guinea,
 continue to be censored.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Public meetings previously were organized under the auspices
 of the party-state. Although the CMRN has not specifically
 stated so, individuals apparently now have the right to meet
 to promote nonviolent causes. The most notable occasion since
 April 1984 was a recent ethnic celebration that would not have
 been permitted before the coup.
 Under the previous government, labor unions were controlled by
 the party-state, union leaders were elected from a single
 slate drawn up by the party, and union membership of employees
 in government, public enterprises, and private joint ventures
 was mandatory. The new Government abolished the party but
 kept the unions. On October 11, 1984, the Ministry of Labor
 announced the restructuring of Guinea's labor movement,
 removal of present labor leaders, and forthcoming elections
 for new leaders. The previous regime's 35 regional labor
 organizations, which were linked to the party-state's regional
 administrative apparatus, will be replaced by a number of
 local unions organized along industrial lines. There will be
 14 industrial trade federations and one national confederation,
 the national confederation of Guinean workers. Union
 membership will be voluntary and democratic elections for
 leaders were being held in January 1985. The national
 confederation plans to maintain relations with the ILO and
 keep its membership in the Organization of African Trade Union
 Unity. The African- American labor center of AFL-CIO is
 preparing a technical assistance program for the confederation.
 In the past, the ILO's Committee on the Application of
 Conventions and Recommendations has raised questions about
 discrimination in employment based on political party
 affiliation and about forced labor in Guinea. During the June
 1984 ILO conference, however, the Committee expressed the hope
 that Guinea in the future would be in a positioA to fulfill
 its obligations in regard to international labor conventions.
 The Guinean representative, referring to the change of
 government and the restructuring process underw*y, said the
 
 
 145
 GUINEA
 Government would be able to answer all questions next year.
 There are no trade or professional associations in Guinea.
 The Government legalized private professions only in May 1984,
 and few professionals have yet established themselves. The
 Government has asked international and national trade and
 professional associations in other countries for help in
 organizing and developing Guinean associations.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 As before the April coup, all religions have the right to
 establish places of worship and maintain contacts with
 coreligionists in other countries. The former cabinet
 included a ministry of Islamic affairs, even though Islam is
 not the official religion of the state. The present
 Government has restructured that ministry, naming it the
 Ministry of Religious Affairs and creating a Christian affairs
 department. The minister is a Muslim leader. It has also
 invited Christian organizations in Guinea to reestablish the
 private schools which had been forced to close by the previous
 regime.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Freedom of movement within the country exists in Guinea, but
 all citizens are required to carry identity cards. Documents
 are often required for internal travel by foreigners but are
 readily obtainable and do not present unreasonable
 difficulties. Families and ethnic groups frequently are
 located across national borders, and substantial movement back
 and forth has been permitted in recent years. Legal entry
 into and exit from the country are subject to the usual
 passport and visa controls.
 Immediately upon taking over the government, the CMRN invited
 refugees and those who had left for economic reasons to return
 to Guinea. Out of an estimated 1.5 million Guineans living in
 other countries, some 200,000 have returned since Sekou
 Toure's death, posing a heavy burden on the economy. The
 Government estimates at least 250,000 in all will eventually
 return and, to meet the emergency situation, was granted $1
 million in supplies and medicines by the United Nations High
 Commissioner for Refugees for the remainder of 1984.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Until April 1984, a constitution provided for a single
 political party to rule the then People's Revolutionary
 Republic of Guinea. Former President Ahmed Sekou Toure
 controlled both the state and the single political party as
 president of the former and secretary-general of the latter.
 On taking control, the military abolished the Constitution,
 the government organs established under it, and the party.
 The nation's name was changed to the Republic of Guinea and a
 25-man Military Committee for National Redressment (CMRN),
 with a 10-man executive bureau, was established to rule the
 country. A president, prime minister, and 39 cabinet members
 were named by the CMRN, as well as officials in charge of
 local, subprefectural, prefectural, provincial, and regional
 levels of government. (In a reorganization December 18, 1984,
 the Office of the Prime Minister was abolished and the Cabinet
 
 
 146
 GUINEA
 and CMRN reduced in numbers.) In all of these appointments an
 attempt was made to balance representation of the various
 ethnic groups in Guinea. The CMRN has spoken generally about
 a new constitution but has not yet announced any plans to
 allow political parties, democratic elections, or a return to
 civilian rule.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Before April 1984, Guinea did not play a human rights role in
 international bodies, and there were no human rights
 organizations in Guinea. Moreover, Guinea was criticized by
 Amnesty International in its 1984 and earlier reports, as
 indicated in Section 1.
 Immediately after taking control of the government, the CMRN
 released all political prisoners and opened the infamous Camp
 Boiro to visitors and the international press. On April 28
 the official newspaper, "Horoya,* reproduced UNESCO's poster
 of the U.N.'s Universal Declaration of Human Rights in a
 two-page centerfold, and the posters were distributed for
 display in government offices and public buildings. On May
 17, 1984, the Government signed the instrument of adhesion to
 the Convention of Geneva of 12 August 1949 and to additional
 protocols of the Convention. The spokesman for a three-person
 Amnesty International delegation that was in Guinea September
 30-October 8 said publicly that governments rarely receive
 Amnesty as warmly and cooperatively as had Guinea. Delegation
 members were allowed to interview 1,000 former political
 detainees and their families, tour Camp Boiro, and visit the
 former governmental officials presently being detained in
 Kindia. Amnesty's International's report of its visit has not
 yet been released.
 The Government has indicated its interest in receiving
 assistance from Senegalese expert, Birame N'Diaye, who was
 designated by the U.N.'s Human Rights Committee, to meet its
 reporting and other responsibilities relating to the
 International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. It has
 also invited representatives of the International League for
 Human Rights, which had been critical of the previous regime's
 human rights policies in its *Guinea's Human Rights Record"
 published in July 1983, to visit Guinea.
 The former regime had published a decree dated January 26,
 1984 establishing a Guinean Red Crescent Society as a branch
 of the International Committee of the Red Cross. The present
 Minister of Public Health reaffirmed the establishment of the
 organization in a proclamation dated June 20, 1984. An
 international official arrived in Guinea in September 1984 and
 is in the process of setting up Red Crescent offices
 throughout the country.
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 Guinea's population is 5.6 million and its per capita gross
 national product reached $305 in 1982. This figure does not
 reflect the fact that only about 150,000 Guineans,
 approximately one-third of the 440,000 employed in the
 industry and services sector, are registered wage earners.
 The remainder are private sector artisans and traders, who
 either sell their goods for sylis (local currency) at the
 
 
 147
 GUINEA
 unofficial rate of exchange, or trade them for foodstuffs and
 consumer goods on the parallel market. Registered wage
 earners (employees of state enterprises, semiprivate joint
 ventures, and government ministries) are allowed to purchase
 essential foodstuffs (rice, cooking oil, flour, sugar, meat,
 and fish) at heavily subsidized prices. The rural sector,
 which comprises most of Guinea's population, is essentially
 outside the national money economy and is largely
 self-sufficient in foodstuffs.
 The liberalization of commerce begun in the late 1970's
 brought more foodstuffs and consumer goods in the parallel
 market, which the previous government tolerated. The influx
 of these goods has increased under the new Government, which
 allows private traders to import and sell goods at whatever
 price the open market will bear, as long as they use their own
 sources of foreign exchange outside the central banking system.
 Agricultural development is one of Guinea's major goals. The
 previous government devoted the largest share (26 percent) of
 its last five-year plan budget to the agro-pastoral sector by
 investing heavily in collectivized state farms. Agricultural
 development and food production, however, continued to lag.
 The new Government abolished the state farms and has announced
 its intention to support the small private farmer. To meet
 this objective, the Government has called on all friendly
 countries for assistance and is preparing a new development
 plan to address the major impediments to agricultural
 productivity, which include the lack of price incentives,
 appropriate technology, infrastructure, and credit to small
 farmers.
 The economy's ability to meet human needs has changed only
 slightly in recent years, according to limited available
 statistics. In 1977 the calorie supply available for
 consumption relative to nutritional requirements was 84
 percent. Life expectancy at birth was estimated to be 44
 years in 1982 and 41 in 1984. The infant mortality rate
 declined slightly from 165 per 1,000 in 1980 to 156 in 1984,
 but is still relatively high compared with that of earlier
 years (141 per 1,000 in 1968). Low nutritional standards and
 sanitary conditions prevailing throughout most of the country
 are largely responsible for infant mortality.
 The overall population growth rate has held at about 2.7
 percent in recent years. About 44 percent of the urban
 population has access to a safe water supply, but this drops
 to 2.5 percent for the rural population. With the assistance
 of foreign donors, the Government has an ambitious nationwide
 program for improving the rural population's access to safe
 water and construction of wells, springs, and canals in the
 fouta djallon and kankan regions.
 With assistance from France and neighboring countries, the
 CMRN is reorganizing the entire education system to eliminate
 ideology based on the writings and declarations of former
 President Sekou Toure and to upgrade the quality of the system.
 The reorganization involves a complete overhaul of
 administration, infrastructure, curricula, textbooks, and
 teaching personnel, public education is to be free and
 universal, and private schools will again be allowed. French
 is being restored as the language of instruction in primary
 schools. One of the CMRN's goals is to increase enrollment in
 primary schools, which was estimated in 1980 to be 40 percent
 
 
 148
 GUINEA
 of boys and 19 percent of girls for a total of 29 percent of
 school age children.
 Women in Guinea have enjoyed a special status as a result of
 the important political role they played prior to independence.
 Guinean women are represented in all professions from civil
 engineering to the national police and armed forces. An
 office of women's affairs has been established in the Ministry
 of Social Affairs. The majority of students enrolled in the
 national medical college have been women. The Government's
 health-care policies have stressed prevention and child and
 mother care, but the quality of care has been low owing to
 inadequate facilities and medical supplies.  Improvement of
 the national health sector is also one of the CMRN's
 priorities.
