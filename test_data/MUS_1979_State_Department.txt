 MAURITIUS
 The rule of law prevails in Mauritius under a British-
 oriented legal system with an independent judiciary. Educa-
 tion is free and available to all as are social and health
 services. Political parties compete openly for votes
 without significant hindrance from the government. The
 country's political and social system enables a free and
 highly partisan press to flourish.
 In December 1976, 22 political parties participated in free
 elections in which opposition parties won more seats than
 the governing Labor Party, which remains in power as part of
 a coalition. Despite serious damage to the economy during
 the past year arising from politically-motivated strikes by
 unions controlled by the opposition party, the government
 has resisted the temptation to move against strike leaders
 (or their opposition masters). Indeed, the government has
 made serious efforts to encourage the rehiring of ring-
 leaders of the illegal August 1979 general strike.
 The government also promotes social and economic programs to
 improve the public welfare. Religious activities, medical
 care and the provision of basic foodstuffs are subsidized by
 the state. Primary and secondary schools and education at
 the University of Mauritius are free. The government
 frequently mandates cost-of-living wage increases for low
 and middle income workers.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 Any use of torture or inhuman punishment is prohibited. The
 Department of State knows of no allegations of their use.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 These have not occurred in Mauritius since the country
 became independent in 1968.
 c. Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 There are no political prisoners in Mauritius. Arbitrary
 arrests occurred in the early 1970's when the government
 jailed opposition political and trade union leaders whom
 it accused of creating chaos and anarchy. During 1979
 members of the opposition party (MMM) were occasionally
 arrested and held for brief periods (no more than 48
 hours) for alleged commission of specific criminal acts
 such as criminal trespass, intimidation or assualt. In most
 cases subsequent trials conducted in conformity with inter-
 nationally-accepted standards of justice have found those
 arrested guilty and punished them usually with fines.
 d. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Mauritius' judicial system is modeled on that of Great
 Britain. Since the early 1970's its record of assuring
 
 
 130
 fair public trials to all offenders has been excellent.
 e. Invasion of the Home
 The sanctity of the home is guaranteed by law, and respected
 in practice.
 2. Governmental Policies Relating to the Fulfillment
 of Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care
 and Education:
 The country's mixed economy is based on sugar production.
 Until well into the twentieth century economic power was
 largely in the hands of the small Franco-Mauritian sugar
 aristocracy. Although much economic power is retained by the
 sugar aristocracy, the rise of labor unions and of a Labor
 Party government have assured a much more equitable distribu-
 tion of resources. Per capita GNP in Mauritius is quite high
 for the developing world. Most workers, except civil servants
 and high-salaried executives, either are exempt from taxes or
 benefit from generous deductions. Taxes are highly progressive.
 The government has actively sought to provide adequate
 health care, education, food and shelter to the people.
 Government expenditures for community and social services,
 including education, health, social security, housing and
 food subsidies, have increased during the past four years by
 60 percent and now make up 52 percent of the annual budget.
 Health care at government hospitals and clinics is free for
 all who cannot pay. As a result of effective family planning
 and government support for population limitation, the birth-
 rate on this densely-populated island declined in 16 years
 from 3.8 percent in 1960 to 2.6 percent in 1976. A concom-
 mitant reduction in population growth has occurred during
 the same period from (2.7 to 1.7 percent), despite the fact
 that life expectancy has almost doubled during the past
 30 years.
 At the beginning of 1977 free secondary education was
 made available to all Mauritians along with training at the
 University of Mauritius. Previously primary education and
 some secondary education were free. Virtually all Mauritian
 children attend school.
 The government subsidizes the sale of rice and flour.
 Because food imports are a serious drain on the economy,
 the government has tried to diversify agricultural production.
 The results have not been encouraging thus far. The govern-
 ment, prodded by opposition criticism, is also attempting to
 address the serious housing shortage but is limited by a lack
 of resources.
 3.    Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Includ-
 ing:
 a.   Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and
 Assembly
 Freedom of speech, press, religion and assembly is pro-
 tected. The public order act requires police permission
 for demonstrations and mass meetings. In August 1979
 the police prohibited entry to a Port Louis public park
 
 
 131
 where union and opposition party members were undertaking
 a hunger strike in support of a general strike. The
 police closed the park to prevent opposition politicians
 from visiting the strikers and exhorting followers to
 violence. Several arrests were made; opposition politicians
 are now standing trial.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel and Emigration
 There are no restrictions on movement within the country,
 foreign travel and emigration.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Political participation is open to every adult citizen.
 Women in Mauritius are free to participate in all types
 of political, business and social activities, and a few
 hold high positions.
 Labor unions are free to organize, bargain collectively
 and strike. Indeed, the economy is frequently in turmoil
 because of seemingly never-ending strikes and go-slows. The
 dock workers and the sugar workers have been particularly
 successful in obtaining pay increases and improved working
 conditions.
 4.   Government Attitudes and Record Regarding Inter-
 national and Non-governmental Investigations of
 Alleged Violations of Human Rights:
 The Department of State does not know of any requests by
 outside organizations to investigate the human rights
 situation in Mauritius.
