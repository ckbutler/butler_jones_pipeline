 BRAZIL
 The Government of Brazil, composed of civilians and military
 officers, is headed by Joao Figueiredo, the fifth retired
 general to occupy that post since the imposition of
 military-dominated governments in 1964. However, with the
 support of the military, President Figueiredo in 1984
 continued a policy aimed at restoring full civilian political
 control. An electoral college will choose a new president on
 January 15, 1985. Neither of the two candidates, both
 civilians, was chosen because of military preference.
 There was a groundswell of popular support in 1984 for direct
 presidential elections, but the Government opposed them for
 1984 or 1985, and several constitutional amendments designed
 to institute them were defeated in Congress. However, each of
 the presidential candidates has promised to restore the direct
 vote for the election of his successor.
 The center of political power is the presidency. It has
 various constitutional and legal devices which constitute
 decisive authority within the Brazilian legal framework. The
 Brazilian Congress continues to play an active and vocal role
 in national policy-making. The combined opposition gained a
 majority of seats in the lower house as a result of the
 November 1982 elections, in which candidates were chosen by
 direct vote. The judiciary is a widely respected and
 independent institution.
 Brazil has an internal security apparatus composed of a
 national intelligence service, a federal police system, a
 militia-type state police, local police, and military
 intelligence units. Many knowledgeable Brazilians believe
 that the government apparatus continues to be used to monitor
 opposition elements which pose no apparent security threat to
 the nation. They believe, however, that there is considerably
 less of this activity than in previous years. There have also
 been charges in the press and by human rights organizations
 that the local and military police have used excessive
 violence in apprehending and processing alleged criminals.
 Critics claim that this practice is widespread, though
 possibly on the decline.
 Economic recession, though serious, has not impeded President
 Figueiredo from pursuing his policy of political
 liberalization. Brazil is the eighth largest economy in the
 non-communist world, yet it must cope with a foreign debt of
 approximately 100 billion dollars, high inflation and four
 consecutive years of low or negative per capita growth. A
 bright spot in the Brazilian economy has been its ability to
 adjust its external sector to current international financial
 conditions, in large part because of the surprisingly large
 growth in its trade surplus.
 The state of human rights generally continued to improve in
 1984, reinforcing the long term trend. Brazilians are largely
 free to participate in the political and economic life of the
 country. The President may, however, invoke constitutionally
 sanctioned emergency powers, and has authority to issue decree
 laws. The Government issued a decree of Emergency Measures on
 April 18, ostensibly to preserve order during a controversial
 vote in the national congress. The decree, affecting
 principally the Brasilia area, imposed briefly censorship of
 radio and television broadcasts and a suspension of freedom of
 
 
 441
 BRAZIL
 assembly and association. Brazil has a National Security Law
 which provides for a military trial of civilians charged under
 it. However, in late 1983 Congress passed a law to narrow its
 scope very substantially. This amendment resulted in the
 release of all persons incarcerated under the National
 Security Law.
 Under the current civil code, Brazilian Indians are considered
 'semi competent* wards of the state and live under certain
 restrictions which are not applicable to other citizens.
 Indians are under pressure from mineral and agricultural
 developers, as well as squatters and legitimate settlers, to
 open more of their lands to others.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1   Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There have been no reports of political killings in 1984.
 However, there have been charges by human rights organizations
 that the civil and military police in Rio have on occasion
 killed individuals suspected of common crimes. The National
 Conference of Brazilian Bishops (CNBB) notes, however, that
 the situation in Rio has improved compared to recent years.
 Several policemen were convicted in 1984 for offenses relating
 to treatment of suspects. The CNBB believes these convictions
 have served as a deterrent to police abuse. Church officials
 estimate that in Sao Paulo several hundred suspects were
 killed by the police in the past twelve months with the state
 police (Policia Militar) being the worst offenders. The
 church perceives no improvement in Sao Paulo in this area for
 the past several years and believes insufficient resources
 have been devoted by the local or state government to combat
 the problem.
 b. Disappearance
 There have been no reports of politically motivated abductions.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Torture is prohibited by the penal code. There have been no
 reports of politically motivated torture in 1984. However,
 various human rights and professional organizations report
 that police beatings and torture of individuals suspected of
 common crimes are widespread. The primary purpose of these
 abuses, according to these organizations, is to extract
 confessions. Such practices primarily affect the
 underprivileged. Church authorities note that in Rio there
 has been a steady decline in such offenses in the last two
 years due to government efforts to curb mistreatment of
 suspects. In Sao Paulo, the practice reportedly remains
 widespread with little change over the past several years.
 Prison facilities continue to be overcrowded and poorly
 maintained and managed. In Sao Paulo, reportedly, there has
 not been any money appropriated for prison improvement in the
 past four years. There has, however, been a recent effort to
 organize prisoner groups within Sao Paulo prisons, with the
 
 
 442
 BRAZIL
 aim of allowing the prisoners to articulate their own
 grievances and to pass these to appropriate government
 officials.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The independent judiciary is largely successful in
 guaranteeing due process of law for citizens. Under Brazilian
 law, an individual may not be arbitrarily detained. Habeas
 corpus is guaranteed by the Brazilian constitution and is
 respected.
 Provisional detention is permissible under Brazilian criminal
 law. It is ordered by judges (in cases of common crimes) or
 by certain high-level administrative authorities (in cases of
 crimes against the public administration, or of extradition),
 not by police. A judge may order provisional detention, for
 example, to preserve public order when there is evidence of
 probable cause, when the accused is dangerous or does not have
 a fixed job or address, or when the individual is caught in
 the act of an unbailable crime. It may also be ordered to
 prevent interference by the accused in criminal proceedings,
 e.g., when the individual might influence or harm witnesses.
 Provisional detention can be extended until the case comes to
 trial or until a judge rules that reasons for the detention no
 longer exist. Provisional detention in Brazil is not
 practiced arbitrarily and does not normally lead to long
 periods of incarceration.
 Individuals charged with violating the National Security Law
 may be held in custody for 30 days. This 30-day period may be
 renewed only by a judicial authority. The accused may be held
 incommunicado for 5 days. A judicial authority must be
 notified immediately (in practice, within 24 hours) in the
 event of an arrest. The judge is required to make a
 determination of the legality of the arrest and the police
 must inform the accused of the charges. An attorney may file
 a habeas corpus request on behalf of the prisoner if the judge
 decides that the prisoner was arrested illegally. In
 practice, all deadlines for notifications and determinations
 are strictly adhered to.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The right to a fair public trial is guaranteed by Brazilian
 law with regard to both penal code and National Security Law
 violations, and is respected in practice. Defendants are
 entitled to counsel and must be made fully aware of the
 charges against them. In cases where a defendant cannot
 afford an attorney, one must be provided free of charge.
 Defendants and their attorneys have the legal right to be
 informed of the evidence on which the charges are based.
 Cases may be tried before a single judge or by jury, except in
 the case of willful crimes against life, in which case a jury
 trial is mandated.
 The Brazilian judicial system is an independent branch of
 government. The Federal Supreme Court is the highest court in
 the land. The federal court system of Brazil is composed of
 courts of the first instance and appeals courts. The states
 are free to organize their own judicial systems as long as
 they do not violate basic principles of the federal
 Constitution. Brazil also has a system of specialized courts
 such as labor courts, electoral courts and juvenile courts.
 
 
 443
 BRAZIL
 Brazil has a military court system charged with the
 responsibility of hearing cases involving military personnel,
 and cases involving civilians charged under the National
 Security Law or with offenses against military installations.
 Legal guarantees also apply in military courts. Civilians
 have the right to appeal to the Federal Supreme Court when
 convicted of crimes against the National Security Law.
 Military personnel also may appeal to the Federal Supreme
 Court in national security cases, but only in extraordinary
 circumstances. In current practice, there is a trend towards
 dismissing National Security Law cases or charging individuals
 under other laws and referring cases to the civilian legal
 system. At present, there are no individuals imprisoned in
 Brazil under the National Security Law. The last person in
 jail under this law was a journalist released in April 1984.
 There is one member of Congress currently charged under the
 *crimes against honor* provision of the National Security Law
 for making a speech considered insulting to the President of
 the Republic.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home or
 Correspondence
 There continue to be allegations that the Government
 selectively employs warrantless wiretaps of opposition group
 members. However, illegal wiretapping apparently has been
 less frequent in recent years. Forced entry into homes
 without a warrant probably occurs in searches for criminals,
 but this practice has declined in recent years, according to
 human rights organizations. There are no reports of such
 illegal entries of homes in political cases. Freedom from
 search is a constitutionally guaranteed right. This right was
 suspended for a period of roughly two weeks in Brasilia by
 decree law in April 1984. The Government explained the
 issuance of the decree as a necessary measure to maintain
 order during a controversial vote in the national Congress.
 Section 2   Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The right to free speech and to a free press are guaranteed in
 the Brazilian Constitution. Opposition viewpoints are
 generally aired freely in various media. The Government has
 exhibited tolerance of criticism, which at times has become
 quite strong.
 Newspapers are privately owned and are vigorous in reporting
 on and discussing government policies and performance. In
 April 1984, an editor who had been convicted under the
 National Security Law for publishing *subversive propaganda"
 was released by unanimous vote of the Supreme Court. There
 have been attempts by the Government to mute criticism of its
 policies by selected newspapers by withdrawing advertising of
 government-controlled corporations. In early 1984, this
 occurred for a two-month period, resulting in economic
 hardship for the newspapers but no perceptible change in their
 editorial policies. However, in October local police in the
 small northern city of Belem raided a printing plant which had
 often been used by leftist groups.
 
 
 BRAZIL
 Self-censorship is rare, being restricted to a very few
 subjects such as sharp and specific criticisms of the armed
 forces, the President, etc. The Inter-American Press
 Association listed Brazil as having a 'free press'.
 Radio and television stations are also privately owned, but
 the Government can withdraw their licenses fairly easily.
 Electronic media broadcasts have covered a vast array of
 topics, including controversial social topics and political
 issues during this past year. However, in April, the
 Government, by virtue of the April 18 emergency decree,
 imposed media censorship of radio and television coverage of
 debate on a controversial bill before Congress. During this
 period of roughly two weeks, news programs were affected and
 one popular television public affairs program was canceled
 entirely. Also during April, the Government blacked out two
 radio stations outside of Brasilia for several hours because
 the stations decided to cover the controversial vote in the
 national Congress. According to Amnesty International,
 television and radio exercise more self-censorship than the
 print media in topics dealing with government personalities
 and policies.
 Foreign publications, except for those from the Soviet Union
 and Eastern bloc countries, are widely distributed in Brazil.
 In 1984, a Brazilian journalist who had written a book
 praising Cuba was detained by Brazilian authorities for
 several hours and copies of his book were seized when he tried
 to bring them into Brazil from Cuba. All foreign and domestic
 films are reviewed for political content, but films are rarely
 barred from commercial distribution. In 1984, the Government
 released about 10 films that it had held up for years, some
 dating from the 1960's.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Brazilian Constitution guarantees the right to peaceably
 assemble, and the right is generally observed. The right of
 association is restricted only in the case of proscribed
 political parties. These parties are held to be illegal on
 grounds that they do not uphold democratic principles--a
 requirement placed on all parties. Although permits must be
 obtained for outdoor public meetings of a political or
 labor-union nature, they are normally freely given--with the
 exception of permits for illegal communist groups. For
 example, in January and February 1984, millions of people
 rallied in major cities to protest the Government's electoral
 policies. There was no attempt to harass or stop these huge
 demonstrations. The rallies were generally peaceful, with
 little interference by the Government. However, in mid-1984,
 the Government acted vigorously to suppress substantial, open
 participation of the outlawed communist parties in the
 presidential campaign rallies.
 Labor has the right to organize and to meet freely. In fact,
 labor unions are legally mandated under the code of labor laws
 to represent workers. Although the labor code makes no
 provision for a "central" or umbrella labor organization, two
 rival *centrals' have emerged. The Government has not
 recognized them, but it has allowed these organizations to
 function. To maintain the official labor structure workers
 are taxed one day's pay per year, a sum which is paid to the
 Government and then divided among confederations, federations
 
 
 445
 BRAZIL
 and local unions. Perhaps 10 to 15 percent of workers
 voluntarily pay union dues in addition to the mandatory tax.
 Most of these voluntary members join more for family health
 benefits than for representation regarding wages or working
 conditions.    Unions are legally prohibited from
 participating in partisan politics, but a number do. To date,
 however, their impact has been small.
 Strikes are severely restricted by obligatory arbitration
 procedures. Notwithstanding restrictions on the right to
 strike after binding arbitration, stronger unions have won a
 number of strikes for higher wages during the past year.
 Employers have a legally mandated structure which parallels
 that of Labor. In addition there are voluntary employer
 organizations not mandated by law. Both the mandatory and
 voluntary associations represent their members to the
 government and act as lobbyists. An even more important
 function is negotiation of collective bargaining agreements
 with the labor unions.
 Unions of workers and employers can maintain ties with
 international organizations such as the ICFTU, but this
 affiliation has to be approved by the President of Brazil and
 the transfer of funds to pay membership charges has to pass
 through the Central Bank. The President has pending a number
 of applications from labor organizations requesting
 association with international organizations; there are even
 more applications pending with the Central Bank for funds to
 pay international dues.
 The International Labor Organization (ILO) received several
 complaints concerning Brazilian unions and union leaders
 during 1983 and 1984. One dealt with the trial of the
 Agricultural Workers Confederation president, Jose Francisco
 da Silva, and Workers Party president, Lula da Silva, under
 the National Security Law. The two men, as well as others,
 were indicted for incitement to riot and subsequently
 acquitted. Another case presented to the ILO concerned a
 rural workers' union president who was assassinated in Paraiba
 state. The murderers have been tried and found guilty.
 Violence continues to occur in the rural northeast between
 labor and management. The resulting insecurity hinders
 development of labor union activity.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 There is no favored or state religion. An overwhelming
 majority of Brazilians belong to the Roman Catholic church.
 All faiths are free to proselytize, establish places of
 worship and train clergy. According to the National Council
 of Brazilian Bishops (CNBB), missionaries and other foreign
 religious visitors have had increasing difficulty entering
 Brazil during the past several years due to the passage of an
 immigration law in 1980. The CNBB does not believe that
 missionaries and religious visitors are being singled out but
 rather that all foreigners are equally affected. Membership
 in a particular religion does not confer any advantage or
 disadvantage.
 Somewhat strained relations continue between the Catholic
 Church and the Government, arising from the Church's political
 
 
 446
 BRAZIL
 and social activism. Relations remained stable during 1984
 with no reported eftorts by the Government to intervene in
 Church programs.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 There are no restrictions on movement within Brazil nor are
 there any unusual restrictions on emigration. Brazil admits
 few immigrants, basing its decision on its ability to absorb
 newcomers, cultural affinity and proximity of the applicant's
 homeland. Brazil is selective in granting asylum, although
 precise criteria do not exist. There is no forcible
 repatriation of Brazilians.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 The focal point of political power resides in the presidency,
 which has been guaranteed by the armed forces. The
 President's constitutional powers include the right to issue
 decree-laws in a number of key areas and, in the event of an
 outbreak of war or threat of serious disturbances, to decree a
 state of siege which permits suspension of many civil rights.
 The direct election of congressmen and senators in November
 1982 produced a popularly representative Congress whose
 influence continues to grow in the decision-making process.
 Congress has been able to modify a number of
 government-sponsored legislative proposals and has, in some
 cases, forced the Government to withdraw proposals.
 All Brazilian citizens may join a political party. The five
 currently legal parties are composed of individuals from
 across the entire political spectrum. The communist party is
 prohibited, but it is actively campaigning for legalization.
 Direct voting is used to choose representatives at the
 federal, state and local levels, except that mayors are
 appointed in State capitals and in certain cities decreed to
 be national security areas. Voting is secret and mandatory
 for all literate adults, who currently make up about 75
 percent of the adult population. Illiterates are not eligible
 to vote. The President and Vice President are chosen by an
 electoral college composed of the federal Congress and six
 representatives from each state legislature. Both candidates
 for the January 15, 1985 elections are civilians.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 There were no outside requests in 1984 from international
 human rights organizations to investigate conditions in Brazil.
 There are a number of Brazilian non-governmental organizations
 active in investigating alleged human rights violations and in
 initiating legal proceedings when appropriate, such as the
 National Bar Association and the Brazilian Press Association.
 Amnesty International has offices in Rio and Sao Paulo.
 Collectively these groups are involved in almost all aspects
 of political and civil rights. There have been no claims by
 any of these organizations that the Government has tried to
 
 
 447
 BRAZIL
 impede their investigations. Relations between these
 organizations and the Government tend to be closer at the
 state and local levels rather than the federal level. There
 is a consensus among human rights observers in Brazil that the
 human rights situation has improved dramatically over the past
 several years. They believe that the main problems now
 concern police behavior toward suspects, prison conditions,
 and certain economic rights. The latest Freedom House report
 lists Brazil as "partly free'.
 Brazil is party to a number of United Nations human rights
 conventions on genocide, racial discrimination, refugees, and
 the political rights of married women.
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 In 1983, Brazil's gross domestic product fell by approximately
 3.2 percent, the third consecutive year of economic
 stagnation. In 1982, the World Bank estimated GNP per capita
 at $2240. By 1983 it had fallen to some $1700. Inflation
 that year surpassed 200 percent. Unemployment rose,
 industrial production fell. The country was in arrears on
 payments of its $95 billion foreign debt. The major bright
 spot in the economy was a trade surplus approaching $6.5
 billion in 1983.
 Continued rapid expansion of exports produced the beginning of
 recovery in 1984. Economic growth for the year is tentatively
 estimated at two to four percent. However, persistent high
 inflation, rapid demographic growth, and the pressures of
 Brazil's high debt service will continue to limit improvements
 in living standards.
 Although evidence suggests that all social strata benefited
 from the country's economic growth during the 1970's, uneven
 income distribution remains a serious social concern.
 According to government statistics, between 1970-80 the
 wealthiest 20 percent of the population increased their share
 of national income from 61 percent to 63 percent while the
 share received by the poorest 60 percent fell from 21.1
 percent to 19.7 percent. Regional income differences are also
 marked. The south-southeast receives 82 percent of national
 income yet has only slightly more than 50.9 percent of the
 population.
 Brazil continues to have a large rural-to-urban migration.
 Seventy percent of Brazil's approximately 134 million
 inhabitants live within 100 kilometers of the coast, and
 nearly 30 percent are concentrated in nine urban areas. The
 Government encourages settlement in the western frontier areas.
 The Government estimates the annual population growth rate at
 about 2.47 percent (the World Bank estimate is 2% for the
 years 1980-2000). Life expectancy at birth is estimated at 65
 years and infant mortality at 66 per 1000 live births.
 However, officials in several northeastern states estimate
 tneir infant mortality rates at well over 200, primarily due
 to the area's chronic poverty and sub-standard health
 facilities.
 Health personnel and health facilities are concentrated in
 urban areas and the industrial southeast, which accounts for
 80 percent of the physicians, 73 percent of the nursing
 personnel, and 79 percent of the hospital beds.
 
 
 448
 BRAZIL
 Significant portions of the society lack adequate nutrition,
 potable water, basic education, and medical care. An
 estimated 23 percent of the population lacks access to safe
 water. Illustrative of these problems are the findings of a
 1980 Brazilian congressional inquiry which indicated that
 Brazil has two million abandoned children and 18 to 25 million
 children without the basic necessities of life. In 1981, 93
 percent of those eligible were enrolled in primary school.
 The World Bank has calculated a primary school enrollment
 ratio of 118. The Ministry of Education estimates that some
 seven million school-age children are not being reached by the
 educational system.
 Discrimination on the basis of sex and race is illegal.
 Nevertheless, the number of women and members of most minority
 groups in the governing structure is much smaller than their
 proportional share of the population. Their relative under-
 representation reflects prevailing cultural attitudes and
 economic disparities.
 The country's estimated 200,000 Indians, living mostly in the
 interior, have suffered in recent decades from gradual
 encroachment of Brazil's coastal population and from the
 Government's effort to promote economic development in
 frontier areas where most Indians live. The increasing
 contact between Indians and newcomers has caused occasional
 conflict. The Figueiredo administration renewed the
 Government's commitment under the 1973 Indian statute to
 protect the Indian population. In addition, the federal
 Indian Affairs Agency has been demarcating tribal lands.
 These should provide a greater measure of security for the
 Indians. Nevertheless, the Indian population continues to
 suffer from governmental neglect, discriminatory governmental
 controls and unequal legal status in issues such as
 citizenship, voting and the right to hold office.
