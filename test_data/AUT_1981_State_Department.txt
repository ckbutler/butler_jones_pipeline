 AUSTRIA
 The Austrian human rights record reflects fundamental
 constitutional and policy orientations which have
 defined the country's domestic and foreign affairs
 since the restoration of Austrian sovereignty in
 1955. The Austrian State Treaty and the federal
 constitution mandate the freedom of the individual
 and guarantee basic civil and political liberties.
 leading exponent of humane values in the
 international community, Austria has pursued an
 active program of assistance to refugees, granting
 permanent settlement and providing first asylum to
 many persons. The Austrian role in facilitating the
 transit of Jewish emigrants from the Soviet Union has
 been accorded widespread praise. A Western-oriented
 society with a highly developed economy, Austria has
 established a system of democracy characterized by
 equality before the law with state support for social
 and economic security.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 Freedom from torture is guaranteed by imperial decree
 of January 2, 1776, and article 3 of the Convention
 for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental
 Freedoms of November 4, 1950, which was incorporated
 into Austrian law on September 3, 1958. These legal
 provisions are respected in practice.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Freedom from cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or
 punishment is guaranteed by law and respected in
 practice. Capital punishment was abolished in 1950.
 c. Disappearances
 Since the restoration of sovereignty, there have been
 no known instances of extralegal or secret abduction
 or arrest of any person in Austria.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 Freedom from arbitrary arrest and imprisonment is
 guaranteed by law and respected in practice. Austria
 has administrative arrest procedures for petty
 offenses, e.g., disturbance of the peace and traffic
 violations, as well as detention procedures pending
 deportation. The period of such arrest is regulated
 and limited by law. Detention pending deportation
 may not exceed three months. The law provides for
 control of these proceedings by either the
 administrative or the constitutional court. Arrested
 persons may be placed in pre-trial, investigative
 detention after a finding by an investigative judge
 that substantial grounds exist for an investigation.
 The period of detention pending completion of an
 investigation is limited to six months and may be
 extended for up to one year (in rare cases involving
 a major crime for up to two years) by a higher
 court. Formal, clearly stated charges are brought at
 the completion of the investigation, and trial
 follows speedily thereafter.

 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Fair public trial is guaranteed by law and respected
 in practice. The judiciary is fully independent of
 the military and the executive. The right to appeal
 to a higher court is guaranteed by pertinent
 provisions of the Austrian code of criminal procedure
 and is fully respected in practice.
 f. Invasion of the Home
 A search warrant, issued by a judge, is required for
 entry of a private residence without consent. In the
 event of rational grounds for the presumption of a
 public hazard or in pursuit of a fugitive from
 justice, the police may enter private premises
 without a warrant. Freedom from invasion of the home
 is guaranteed by the following lawst  (1) law no. 88
 of October 27, 1892, which is incorporated in the
 Austrian constitution; (2) several provisions of the
 Austrian code of criminal procedure and (3) article
 8 of the 1950 Human Rights Convention. The
 authorities carefully observe these legal safeguards.
 2. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties,
 Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and
 Assembly
 Freedom of speech, press, religion and assembly is
 guaranteed by law and respected in practice. Labor
 unions enjoy full rights and privileges in both law
 and practice.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country,
 Foreign Travel, Emigration and Repatriation
 Freedom of movement within the country, foreign
 travel and emigration are guaranteed by law and
 respected in practice. Austria's record in refugee
 affairs is excellent. Austria has acted as a land of
 first asylum (its primary role), and has also granted
 permanent refuge to substantial numbers of ethnic
 Germans, Hungarians (1956), Czechs and Slovaks
 (1968/9), and other Eastern Europeans. More
 recently, large numbers of Polish citizens have
 sought permanent or temporary refuge in Austria.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political
 Process
 Freedom to participate in the political process is
 guaranteed by law and respected in practice. Women
 participate widely in the-political process; they
 hold a number of important positions in party
 structures as well as in government.
 3. Government Attitude and Record Regarding
 International and Non-governmental Investigation
 of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 There have been no :investigations of Austria's human
 rights record nor have there been any requests for
 such investigation by major, non-governmental human
 rights organizations.
 
 
 721
 Austria has deposited a declaration with the
 secretary general of the Council of Europe
 recognizing the competence of the Human Rights
 Commission in Strasbourg under article 25 of the
 European Convention to receive petitions from any
 person or persona claiming to be a victim of a
 violation of the rights set forth in the convention,
 and undertaking not to hinder the effective exercise
 of these rights. Thus persons believing that their
 rights have been infringed by the Austrian
 authorities may bring the matter before the
 commission.
 4. Economic and Social Circumstances
 The benefits of Austria's economic, social and
 educational system are available to all Austrian
 citizens and permanent residents irrespective of
 race, religion, sex, ethnic background or political
 opinion.
 As in most industrialized countries, women are
 assuming more important positions in Austrian
 society. Women enjoy by law full equality with men
 in Austria, but there are differences in treatment
 resulting from tradition and local custom. For
 example, equal pay is guaranteed for equal work, but
 women sometimes have difficulties in being assigned
 to well-paying jobs. Women's prospects for
 promotions are often hampered by such factors as
 maternity leave and their inability to work overtime
 because of responsibility at home. It is still
 difficult for women to get into leading positions,
 especially in rural areas where women are more
 strongly bound by tradition.
 The Austrian State Treaty states that the Slovene and
 Croatian minorities shall enjoy the same rights on
 equal terms as all other Austrian nationals, and it
 protects their ethnic rights. The Austrian
 parliament in 1976 passed legislation regulating the
 legal status of these ethnic groups, reserving to the
 national government the power to decree where a
 minority language shall be accepted as an official
 language, in addition to German, and other aspects of
 the Austrian state relationship to these minorities.
 There are disagreements regarding the compliance of
 the Austrian government with the terms of the State
 Treaty on minority rights. The Austrian government
 claims that its efforts on behalf of the ethnic
 minorities have been adequate and that further steps
 in some'areas, such as bilingualism in judicial and
 administrative bodies, and in the civil service in
 areas where there are substantial minority groups,
 are not feasible given the high economic cost end the
 small size of minority groups. This position is
 challenged by some minority group representatives.
 It is unlikely that these differences will be
 completely resolved, but the Austrian government
 continues to hold regular meetings with minority
 representatives in an effort to respond to their
 concerns, to reduce the emotional strains caused by
 these disagreements, and to demonstrate its concern
 for the interests of the minority groups.
 The following are relevant economic and social
 indicators: per capita GNP in 1980 was $10,1701 life
 expectancy at birth is 72, with a fertility rate of
 1.7 percent, an infant mortality rate of 15 per 1,000
 live births (1978) and an average annual population
 growth rate of 0.1 percent in the 1970's; the
 adjusted primary school enrollment in 1978 was 100
 (100 for males, 99 for females), and adult literacy
 is at 99 percent.
