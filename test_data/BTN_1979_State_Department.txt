 BHUTAN
 
 The Himalayan Kingdom of Bhutan with an area of 18,000
 square miles and a population of 1.2 million, is a sovereign,
 independent state. However, in accordance with a treaty
 with India signed in 1949, Bhutan agreed that it would be
 "guided" by India in the conduct of its foreign affairs.
 During the enlightened rule (1952-72) of the late King Jigme
 Dorji Wangchuck, Bhutan emerged from centuries of seclusion
 and made considerable headway toward modernizing its politi-
 cal system. Although the King continued to retain full
 executive powers, he created several important institutions
 such as the National Assembly (1953), the Royal Advisory
 Council (1965) and the Council of Ministers (1968) to pro-
 vide for broader participation in government. Serfdom was
 abolished, land reforms introduced, laws codified and the
 judiciary separated from the executive. The present King,
 Jigme Singye Wangchuck, has continued the process of turning
 Bhutan into a modern state. In 1971 Bhutan joined the United
 Nations. In addition to India, it has diplomatic relations
 with Bangladesh.
 1.   Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a.   Torture;
 b.   Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punish-
 ment;
 c.   Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment;
 d.   Denial of Fair Public Trial; and
 e.   Invasion of the Home
 Information about items (a) through (e) is not readily avail-
 able. The US has no diplomatic relations with Bhutan and
 American officials rarely travel there. However there is no
 evidence that there is any resort to cruel, inhuman or degrad-
 ing punishment or treatment. Bhutanese society, largely
 agrarian and traditional, is considered peaceful with a very
 low crime rate. Punishment for most criminal offenses is
 light, ranging from fines to imprisonment. The death
 penalty has been abolished. However Bhutan has no written
 constitution and it is not clear exactly what kind of legal
 protection Bhutanese citizens enjoy vis-a-vis the state.
 Representatives of the Dalai Lama in India have claimed that
 some members of the Tibetan refugee community in Bhutan have
 been subjected to arbitrary arrest and torture but this is
 difficult to verify. Bhutan is pressuring some 4,000 of the
 refugees to accept Bhutanese citizenship or face possible
 expulsion from the country.
 2.   Governmental Policies Relating to the Fulfillment of
 Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care and
 Education
 Twenty-five years ago economic development in Bhutan was
 largely stagnant and illiteracy'nearly universal. Under a
 (730)
 
 
 731
 succession of five year development plans that began in
 1961, Bhutan has made steady progress in improving its
 agriculture, transport, communications, education and health.
 Although pockets of poverty probably exist in remote regions
 of the country, the kind of abject destitution sometimes
 found in other parts of the Indian subcontinent is largely
 absent in Bhutan. The number of schools and school-going
 children has risen sharply in recent years. Primary educa-
 tion is free and students at higher levels often receive
 free board and lodging. University training requires travel
 abroad, but a rudimentary college system is reportedly under
 development. Bhutan has eradicated smallpox and has launched
 programs to control malaria, tuberculosis, leprosy and goiter.
 Although agriculture is the mainstay of the economy, plans
 to establish some light industries are reportedly underway.
 Bhutan receives some financial and technical assistance
 through the UNDP and the Colombo Plan. A small number of
 countries, including India, provide a limited amount of
 bilateral aid to Bhutan.
 3.   Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a.   Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 The only "newspaper" in Bhutan is a weekly government bulle-
 tin. Radio is controlled by the state. Although Buddhism is
 a state religion, members of other faiths, mainly Hindus of
 Nepali origin, enjoy freedom of worship. Criticism of the
 King, a hereditary monarch, is permitted in the National
 Assembly. Civil and political liberties have no constitu-
 tional foundation in Bhutan, but the role of government by
 and large appears to be a benign one. Some supporters of
 the Dalai Lama believe that a small number of Tibetans held
 in connection with a 1974 assassination plot against the King
 of Bhutan should be considered political prisoners.
 b.   Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel and Emigration
 There is full freedom of movement within Bhutan for Bhutan-
 ese citizens and no bar on emigration or foreign travel.
 Tibetan refugees, however, must seek government permission
 to travel within the country. Bhutan issues its own visas,
 but passage by foreigners across "restricted" and/or "pro-
 tected" Indian territory adjacent to Bhutan requires a per-
 mit issued by the Government of India. There is no air link
 between Bhutan and the outside world.
 c.   Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 There are no political parties in Bhutan and their formation
 appears to be discouraged. The 150-member National Assembly
 is made up of 98 indirectly elected peoples representatives,
 40 representatives nominated by the King, 10 nominated by
 the Buddhist monasteries, and two members from the business
 community. The Assembly performs the triple functions of
 enacting laws, approving senior appointments and advising
 the government on matters of national importance. It also
 provides a forum for ventilating grievances and rectifying
 cases of maladministrition. The King has no right to veto
 legislation passed by the National Assembly, although he can
 refer bills back to it for further consideration. Local
 administration is carried out by centrally appointed govern-
 ment officials. Villages have traditionally had the right
 to elect their own headmen who form the lowest rung of the
 administrative hierarchy.
 4.   Government Attitude and Record Regarding International
 and Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Viola-
 tions of Human Rights
 As far as is known, no international agency or group has
 sought entry into Bhutan to investigate alleged violations
 of human rights. No non-governmental human rights' groups
 are known to exist in Bhutan.
