 GUINEA
 
 Guinea is a one-party socialist state. Sekou Toure has
 been its only President since Guinea's decision to break
 away from the French community and declare its indepen-
 dence in 1958. The sudden break with France seriously
 injured the economy of the new nation, which subsequent-
 ly had a long struggle for survival, punctuated every
 year or two by reports of a coup plot or imminent
 foreign attack. A sea-borne invasion by Portuguese
 mercenaries and Guinean emigres in November 1970 height-
 ened Guinea's external security concerns. It led to a
 zealous investigation of all suspected traitors and to
 the arrest and imprisonment of many. A general amnesty
 of all Guinean "exiles" was issued in July 1977, but the
 regime's continuing fears for its survival were laid to
 rest only in March 1978 with normalization of Guinea's
 relations with neighboring Senegal and Ivory Coast.
 Sekou Toure's socialist philosophy and policies have
 emphasized ideological commitment rather than material
 rewards as an incentive for production, but the opening-
 up of the private market economy in 1977-78 has tempered
 ideological appeals with a new pragmatism. The Govern-
 ment of Guinea views domination of blacks by whites in
 southern Africa as Africa's primary human rights problem.
 Within Guinea, official pronouncements emphasize
 the rights of the community over individual human
 rights, although the Government in January 1978 ratified
 the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights
 and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and
 Cultural Rights. Past threats to Guinea's security
 reinforce this preoccupation with survival and the
 rights of the community, and are considered by the
 Government to justify its broad police powers and
 maintenance of a pervasive security apparatus. While
 exact information is not available, the number of
 political prisoners is probably well under one thou-
 sand. Several hundred have been released over the past
 eighteen months. The Government reportedly plans to
 release most of the remainder. Although no allegations
 
 
 73
 of such misconduct have been received recently, reports
 of political arrests and torture were common in the
 past.
 1.   Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a.   Torture
 The book "African Prison" by the late Jean Paul Alata
 and a June 1977 report by the International League for
 Human Rights have described cases of torture during the
 early 1970s. Torture was said to have been officially
 sanctioned at a high level when certain confessions were
 sought. In its June 1977 bulletin, Amnesty Internation-
 al stated that it was continuing to receive reports of
 the systematic use of torture in detention camps,
 especially Camp Boiro.  (See l.b. below) However, it is
 not clear whether Amnesty International was referring
 to allegations of such mistreatment occurring in 1978 or
 in previous years. No additional allegations have been
 received of torture occurring in 1978. Torture appears
 to have been largely confined to the initial interroga-
 tion period after the arrests.
 b.   Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Amnesty International has reported that prison con-
 ditions in Guinea are "extremely bad" and that prisoners
 have in some cases been deprived of food and water, some
 reportedly dying under these conditions. Public beat-
 ings for thievery or other offenses have occasionally
 occurred, primarily to deter crime by harsh example.
 Those forced to confess to political crimes have been
 publicly denounced in a degrading manner.
 c.   Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 The Government occasionally purges those suspected of
 plotting against it. Public officials who fall into
 disfavor have been subject to detention. No reports of
 any recent political arrests have been received.
 Amnesty International reported that the total number of
 political prisoners in Guinea in 1977 could conserva-
 
 
 tively be estimated at 1,000. This figure included some
 former senior government officials. The June 1977
 estimate by the International League of Human Rights was
 more than 3,000. By current estimates the probable
 number of "political" prisoners in detention is substan-
 tially under 1,000. Given the lack of solid data
 available, this figure cannot be verified. Many prisoners
 have been released over the past few years. The Guinean
 official gazette announced the release of 128 prisoners
 in September 1976 and 150 more in January 1977. These
 apparently included political prisoners. Additional
 prisoners, some reportedly political, were released
 during the May 14, 1977 celebration of the thirtieth
 anniversary of the Guinean Democratic Party. Following
 the August 1977 market women's riots, several hundred
 were briefly detained but all were released. About
 sixty political prisoners were released in December
 1977. In 1978, approximately 95 political prisoners
 were released on the occasion of the Guinean Democratic
 Party's anniversary and another sixty detainees, includ-
 ing several former government officials, were freed in
 November.
 The fate of former OAU Secretary General Telli Diallo
 is still unknown, although recent press reports quote
 President Toure as stating that: "Telli has been
 sentenced, and therefore he is no longer under my
 authority." The President reportedly added that "all
 those who have been sentenced to death are dead." The
 Guinean Government has informed the United States
 Government that releases of political prisoners will
 continue. It has claimed also that some former pris-
 oners considered to have been rehabilitated have again
 taken up official positions of trust, although no
 indication was given as to the number of such individ-
 uals. Many relatives of political prisoners have been
 able to lead normal lives, although others have fled
 abroad. Relaxed political controls inside Guinea,
 improved economic prospects and President Toure's July
 1977 amnesty of all exiles have combined to encourage
 about 20,000 Guinean emigres to return to their home-
 land as of late 1978, evidently without subsequent
 harassment.

 d.   Denial of Fair Public Trial
 In civil and criminal cases, constitutional and statuto-
 ry procedures exist but are not regularly applied.
 Guinean law does not permit professional lawyers in
 private practice. Generally defendants appear without
 benefit of legal counsel, although Guinean law provides
 for selection of well-educated private citizens to act
 as ad hoc defense counsel in civil proceedings.
 In political cases such as the trials following the 1970
 Portuguese/mercenary attack on Conakry and the 1976
 "Foulah plot," the political dictates of the Government
 leadership ruled out application of constitutional
 provisions regarding judicial procedures. Some politi-
 cal cases have involved public show trials in which the
 verdict was apparently determined on the basis of a
 prior "confession." The presiding officials have used
 such occasions for mass political education. Other
 political trials have been held in camera. No political
 trials are known to have taken place inGuinea since
 1976.
 e.   Invasion of the Home
 Police apparently enter homes in pursuit of suspects
 and to obtain evidence, with constitutional safe-
 guards subordinated to professed security concerns.
 2.   Governmental Policies Relating to the Fulfillment
 of Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care
 and Education
 Government policy is directed towards improving the
 economic well-being of the people. The Government has
 accorded priority allocation of budgetary resources to
 improving food production and marketing, the availabi-
 lity of consumer goods, health services and education.
 However, limited progress has been achieved in improving
 the overall standard of living. Agricultural production
 has not yet reached the levels attained at independence,
 and Guinea ranks, with a per capita income of approxi-
 mately $140, among the poorest nations in the world.
 Nevertheless, action begun by the Government in late
 
 
 76
 1977 to end repression by the economic police, to
 remove roadblocks on internal highways, to tolerate
 the resumption of private market activity and to relax
 import controls (and thereby greatly increase avail-
 ability of food and consumer goods), have improved
 the commercial and the general psychological atmosphere.
 Ideology remains a dominant factor, however, and while
 the central goal of socio-economic policy has been the
 development of adequate housing, education and medical
 facilities, the Government's ideological approach has
 frequently impeded orderly, rational economic develop-
 ment. Corruption does not appear to hamper government
 implementation of economic development policies.
 The Government has devoted substantial resources to
 education, with the number of college students increas-
 ing from virtually none at independence to about 4,000
 in 1978. Merit plays a large part in selecting candi-
 dates for technical training or advanced education
 abroad, but the Guinean Government has full control over
 the application procedure. Since independence, the
 literacy rate has increased from less than one percent
 to ten percent. Income disparities in Guinea are not
 large, and income tax rates are progressive.
 3.   Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Includ-
 ing:
 a.   Freedom of Thought, Speech, Press, Religion
 and Assembly
 The Government discourages independent intellectual
 inquiry and dissent from its political and ideological
 tenets. Islam is officially supported, and Christianity
 is tolerated. Assembly is subject to police controls.
 The press is government-controlled and few publications
 are are available, but limited journalistic criticism of
 shortcomings on the part of government agencies has
 recently been permitted.
 b.   Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel and Emigration
 While internal movement had been subject to an ex-
 
 
 tensive police and paperwork control system, it appears
 to have become substantially free in 1978. Legal entry
 into and exit from the country are still subject to
 controls, but their administration has become notably
 more relaxed, and Guineans appear to be able to move
 without difficulty across borders with neighboring
 states. While more than one million Guineans are believ-
 ed to have departed since 1958 because of political or
 economic conditions, the exodus appears to have
 abated substantially. As noted above, many Guineans
 have returned to Guinea as political and economic
 constraints have been eased. There is little freedom to
 dissent or to avoid taking part in regime-directed
 political activity which guides many aspects of Guinean
 life.
 c.   Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 The Guinean people are regularly exhorted to adhere to a
 continuing "revolution" which the single-party state
 conducts in their name. However, President Toure
 regularly sees many petitioners and supplicants, and the
 Government contends that the party-state structure and
 popular referenda provide adequate reflection of the
 people's wishes. Labor unions are firmly controlled by
 the Government.
 Since independence, the Guinean Government has made a
 conscious effort to improve the position of women in
 society. There is no legal discrimination against women.
 The Ministry of Social Affairs is largely staffed by
 women, and the Minister is a woman who previously served
 as Guinean Ambassador to the United Nations. Women are
 integrally involved in the professional fields of edu-
 cation, medicine and social affairs, and are influential
 in the small non-government market sector of the economy.
 4.   Government Attitude and Record Regarding Inter-
 national and Non-Governmental Investigation of
 Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The United Nations investigated the 1970 mercenary
 attack on Guinea, and the Guinean Government as recently
 as 1978 expressed willingness for outsiders to observe
 
 
 78
 its humanitarian practices. In 1977 Amnesty Interna-
 tional sought contact with Guinean authorities with a
 view to intervening on behalf of political prisoners and
 sending a mission to Guinea. The Government did not
 respond. A representative of the International Commit-
 tee of the Red Cross was received in Guinea in March
 1978, but the Government has not yet announced if it
 will permit a follow-up investigative visit. The
 Guinean Government rejects charges leveled at it by the
 International League for Human Rights and Amnesty
 International, maintaining that its political prisoners
 are convicted traitors whose activities represented a
 threat to the survival of the regime.
