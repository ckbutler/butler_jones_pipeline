 KAZAKSTAN
 The Constitution of Kazakstan concentrates power in the Presidency. President
 Nursultan Nazarbayev is the dominant political figure. The Constitution, adopted
 in 1995 in a referendum marred by irregularities, permits the President to legislate
 by decree and dominate the legislature and judiciary; it cannot be changed or
 amended without the President's consent. Presidential elections originally scheduled
 for 1996 did not take place, as President Nazarbayev's term in office was extended
 to 2000 in a separate 1995 referendum, also marred by irregularities. Under the
 new Constitution, Parliament's powers are more limited than before. However,
 members of Parliament have the right to introduce legislation and several bills were
 drafted for submission to the full Parliament. The judiciary remained under the con-
 trol of the President and the executive branch. The lack of an independent judiciary
 made it difficult to root out corruption, which was pervasive throughout the Govern-
 ment.
 The Ministry of Internal Affairs supervises the criminal police, who are poorly
 paid and widely believed to be corrupt. A new institution established in October
 1995, the State Committee for Investigations (0SK), is a federal investigative and
 law enforcement agenc. The Committee for National Security (KN, successor to
 the KGB) continued efforts to legitimize its role by focusing on activities to combat
 terrorism, organized crime, and official corruption.
 Kazakstan is rich in natural resources, chiefly petroleum and minerals, but its
 state-dominated economy continued to decline. Although the Government has been
 successful in stabilizing the local currency (tenge) and slowing inflation, structural
 reforms continue to lag. The agricultural sector, traditionally accounting for over
 one-third of national employment and production, has been slow to privatize. The
 Government successfully privatized most small- and medium-sized firms, and is
 working to privatize large-scale industrial complexes, particularly in the oil and gas
 sector.
 The Government generally respected the human rights of its citizens. Citizens
 enjoy basic rights of-freedom of religion, speech, and assembly. Nonetheless, demo-
 cratic institutions are weak. The Government infringed on citizens' right to change
 their government. The legal structure, including the Constitution adopted in 1995,
 does not fully safeguard human rights. Members of the security forces often beat
 or otherwise abused detainees, and already harsh prison conditions continued to de-
 teriorate. There were allegations of arbitrary arrest, and prolonged detention is a
 problem. The judiciary remains under the control of the President and the executive
 branch, and corruption is deeply rooted. The Government infringed on citizens' right
 to privacy. The Government generally tolerates independent media, although the
 media practiced self-censorshnip, and the Government maintained control of mast
 printing facilities and supplies. Freedom of assembly was sometimes restricted, and
 freedom of association, while generally respected, was sometimes hindered by com-
 plicated registration requirements for organizations and political parties. The Gov-
 
 
 990-
 ernment regulates the activities of foreign religious associations. The Government
 discriminated in favor of ethnic Kazaks. Domestic violence against women remained
 a problem. There was discrimination against women, the disabled, and ethnic mi-
 norities. The Government tried to limit the influence of independent trade unions,
 both directly and through its support for state-sponsored unions, and members of
 independent unions were harassed.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrqjudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political
 killings. There were credible reports that a few detainees died due to mistreatment
 during interrogation by the security forces (see Section l.c.). Human rights organiza-
 tions reported that there were several cases of detainees being killed while in cus-
 tody d  ,  interrogations. In December the Chief of Criminal Investigations in the
 Moinkum Department of the State Committee for Investigations in Zhambyl was ar-
 rested on the charge that a detainee died due to mistreatment during interrogation
 while under his authority in December 1995. According to the press the victim's
 death was due to serious bodily injuries and a lack of oxygen caused by the use of
 a gas mask to obtain a confession. The Prosecutor General's office confirmed that
 the investigation is continuing.
 The Government reported that as of June, over 500 inmates imprisoned under
 harsh conditions with inadequate medical treatment had died of disease. Human
 rights monitors agreed, but estimated that 2500 prisoners had died by year's end.
 There were no reports of poitically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punshment.-
 The Constitution states that "no one must be subject to torture, violence or other
 treatment and punishment that is cruel or humiliating to human dignity." However,
 there were credible reports that police beat or treateddetainees abusively to obtain
 confessions. Human rights observers report that detainees are sometimes choked,
 handcuffed to radiators, or have plasticbags placed over their heads to force them
 to divulge information. Training standards for police are very low and individual
 law enforcement officials are often poorly supervised.
 There are credible reports that a few detainees died as a result of mistreatment
 during interrogation. There is evidence that one detainee was killed during interro-
 gation in December 1995 in Zhambyl province (see Section l.a.).
 In August security forces arrested and beat Nina Sidorova, the leader of an ethnic
 Russian political movement. The Prosecutor General's office admitted that Sidorova
 had been mistreated and ordered an internal investigation.
 Army personnel subjected conscripts to brutal hazing, including beatings and
 verbal abuse.
 Prison conditions were harsh and continued to deteriorate, due to diminishing re-
 sources. In June, while testifying before the Senate, the Minister of Interior noted
 that about $64.3 million (4.5 billion tenge) was needed to support the prison popu-
 lation, however, the Government allocated only about $37.1 million (1.9 billion
 tenge). In December the Ministry of Interior reported that, as of November 1, there
 were 72,305 prisoners in facilities designed for 60,000. Local human rights activists
 allege that there are 97,000 prisoners (including 20,000 in pretrial detention) in
 these facilities.
 Overcrowding, combined with an inadequate prison diet and a lack of medical
 supplies and personnel, contributed to tuberculosis, hepatitis, and other diseases. In
 December the Government reported that more than 16,000 inmates suffered from
 tuberculosis with over 12,000 having the active form of the disease. The Kazakstan-
 American Human Rights Bureau estimated that 2,500 inmates had died of tuber-
 culosis and other diseases as of June.
 According to the Government, 2,531 inmates died. Tuberculosis was the cause of
 death in 56.7 percent of all cases; malnutrition accounted for 10.2 percent of deaths.
 The incidence of malnutrition doubled from 2,000 cases in 1995 to 4,000. According
 to the Government, budget cuts (penitentiaries received less than 50 percent of re-
 quested funds last year) have reduced the quality of food and the stocks of medicine.
 In virtually all prisons, medications are available for emergency care only; only 1
 in 10 tuberculosis patients in prison receives medication.
 Prison guards, who are poorly paid, steal food and medicines intended for pris-
 oners. Violent crime among prisoners is routine.
 To reduce prison overcrowding, President Nazarbayev announced in July an am-
 nesty for 20,000 prisoners convicted of minor offenses. This number was later
 changed to 8,500 after concerns were expressed that the amnesty would lead to a
 resurgence in the crime rate, which had been falling. However, in December the
 
 
 Ministry of Interior noted that more than 10,000 prisoners were able to take advan-
 tage of the amnesty offer. The first beneficiaries of the amnesty program were teen-
 age offenders, war veterans, and the widows of war veterans. In August a similar
 amnesty law for the military came into force stipulating that all deserters who re-
 turned voluntarily to their army units before October 15 would not be tried by a
 military tribunal. Servicemen penalized for other offenses were also eligible for the
 amnesty. The press reported that about 3,000 soldiers were affected. No additional
 information about the amnesty was available from the Government.
 Prisoners are allowed only one visit every 6 months, but additional visits may be
 granted in emergency situations. Juveniles are kept in separate facilities.
 The Government worked with local human rights groups to improve prison condi-
 tions, but unlike the previous year did not permit monitoring of prison conditions
 by local media and human rights groups in 1996. However, in December, a visiting
 United Nations delegation was permitted to visit several penal institutions in
 Almaty.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Government continued the process
 of reforming the legal system throughout 1996. Much of the old Soviet legal system
 remained in force w'ile new laws were being prepared to bring the legal sstem into
 accord with the Constitution. Local human rights organizations alleged that the
 Government used minor infractions of the law or manufactured charges to arrest
 and detain Government opponents arbitrarily, including leaders of ethnic Russian
 and Cossack organizations like Nina Sidorova, and opposition politicians like the
 leaders of the Azamat political movement who were arrested and fined for organiz-
 ing an illegal demonstration in November in Almaty. In addition after a govern-
 ment-sanctioned opposition rally in December called for the resignation of the Presi-
 dent and Prime Minister, one of the rally's organizers, Petr Svoik, was summoned
 by the State Committee for Investigations to discuss possible charges in connection
 with alleged wrongdoing during his tenure as the head of the State Antimonopoly
 Committee. In August, according to press reports, the Government responded to al-
 legations that the arrests of two Cossacks in Kokshetau were politically motivated
 by asserting that the two were involved in a "terrorist plot*.
 The law sanctions pretrial detention. According to the Constitution, police may
 hold a detainee for 72 hours before bringing charges. After 72 hours, police may con-
 tinue to hold the detainee for 10 days with the approval of a prosecutor. In practice,
 police routinely hold detainees, with the sanction of a prosecutor, for weeks or even
 months without bringing charges.
 Defendants accused of serious crimes remain incarcerated until trial. Those ac-
 cused of less serious crimes can be eligible for a "podpiska--a system similar to
 bail. With the agreement of the Prosecutor General, the accused can be released
 from jail until trial if two persons make sworn written statements that the accused
 will not leave the locality. The law stipulates that the length of pretrial detention
 is 2 months, although the length of pretrial detention can be extended up to 1 year,
 with the approval of the Prosecutor General. The Prosecutor General stated that be-
 tween 70 and 80 percent of those accused of a crime are considered to be eligible
 for bail; however, the Kazakstan-American Human Rights Bureau believes that the
 percentage of accused persons who actually obtain bail is small.
 According to the Constitution, every person detained, arrested, or accused of com-
 mitting a crime has the right to the assistance of a defense lawyer from the moment
 of detention, arrest, or accusation-a right generally respected in practice. However,
 human rights activists allege that members of the security forces have pressured
 prisoners to refuse the assistance of an attorney, sometimes resulting in a delay be-
 Ore te accused sees a lawyer. Detainees may also appeal the legality of detention
 or arrest to the prosecutor before trial; previously, detainees could apeal the legal-
 ity of detention or arrest to the court. If the defendant cannot afford an attorney,
 the Constitution provides that the State must provide one free of charge. Human
 rights organizations allege that many prisoners are unaware of this provision of the
 law. Although some lawyers are reluctant to defend clients unpopular with the Gov-
 ernment, there were no reports of government reprisals against attorneys. However,
 there were reports that several lawyers defending opposition figures were attacked
 and beaten by "unknown assailants."
 The Government does not use forced exile.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-Government interference and pressure com-
 promised the court system's independence throughout 1996-a situation codified in
 the Constitution's establishment of a judiciary fully under the control of the Presi-
 dent and the executive branch. At year's end, the Government was still in the proc-
 ess of restructuring the judicial system to bring it into line with provisions of the
 Constitution.
 
 
 992
 There are three levels in the court system: local; oblast (provincial); and the Su-
 preme Court. According to the Constitution, the President proposes to the upper
 house of Parliament (the Senate) nominees for the Supreme Court (recommended
 by the "Highest Judicial Council", a body chaired by the President, which includes
 the chairperson of the Constitutional Council, the chairperson of the Supreme
 Court, the Procurator General, the Minister of Justice, senators, judges, and other
 persons appointed by the President). The President appoints oblast judges (nomi-
 nated by the Highest Judicial Council) and local level judges from a list presented
 by the Ministry of Justice, based on recommendations from the "Qualification Colle-
 gium of Justice, an autonomous institution made up of deputies from the lower
 house of Parliament (the Majilis), judges, public prosecutors and others appointed
 by the President.
 Judges are appointed for 10-year terms, although a new draft law on Judges will
 reportedly give the President the power to appoint judges for life. The Constitution
 abolished the earlier Constitutional Court and established a Constitutional Coun-
 cil-three of its seven members, including the chairman, are directly appointed by
 the President. The Council rules on election and referendum challenges, interprets
 the Constitution, and determines the constitutionality of laws adopted by Par-
 liament. Under the Constitution, citizens no longer have the right to appeal directly
 to a court that a government action is unconstitutional; this action is now the sole
 prerogative of the courts themselves.
 Local courts try less serious crimes, such as petty theft and vandalism. Oblast
 courts handle more serious crimes, such as murder, grand theft, and organized
 criminal activities. The oblast courts may also handle cases in rural areas where
 no local courts are organized. Judgments of the local courts may be appealed to the
 oblast-level courts, while those of the oblast courts may be appealed to the Supreme
 Court. There is also a military court. Specialized and extraordinary courts can also
 be created-for example, economic, taxation, family, juvenile, and admini strtive
 courts-which have the status of oblast and local courts. The Constitution and exist-
 ing law establish the necessary procedures for a fair trial. Trials are public, with
 the exception of instances in which an open hearing could result in secrets being
 divulged, or when the private life or personal family secrets of a citizen have to be
 protected.
 According to the Constitution, defendants have the right to be present, the right
 to counsel (at public expense if needed), and the right to be heard in court and call
 witnesses for the defense. Defendants enjoy a presumption of innocence, are pro-
 tected from self-incrimination, and have the right to appeal a aecision to a higher
 court. Legal proceedings are to be conducted in the state language, Kazak, although
 Russian may also be used officially in the courts. Proceedings may also be held in
 the language of the majority of the population in a particular area.
 The problem of corruption is evident at every stage and level of the judicial proc-
 ess. Judges are poorly paid; the Government has not made a vigorous effort to root
 out corruption in the judiciary. According to ress reports, judicial positions can be
 purchasedi A seat on the bench in a municipal district court, for example, reportedly
 costs $6,000. Anecdotal evidence stemming from individual cases suggests that
 judges solicit bribes from participants in trials and rule accordingly. In June the
 Chief Justice and another member of the Supreme Court were dismissed for taking
 bribes.
 There were no reports of political prisoners. A few people were tried and convicted
 of violating laws on conducting rallies or demonstrations, or for slandering officials.
 None was incarcerated at year's end. According to local human rights monitors,
 journalist Boris Suprynuk, who was tried, sentenced, and imprisoned for "insulting"
 a public prosecutor in May 1995, was released from prison in the spring. He now
 lives and works in the Russian Federation.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution provides that everyone has the right to "confidentiality of personal de-
 posits and savings, correspondence, telephone conversations, postal, telegraph and
 other messages." Litation of this right is allowed "only in the cases ana according
 to the procedure directly established by law." However, the KNB and Ministry of
 Internal Affairs, with the concurrence of the General Prosecutor's office, can and do
 arbitrarily interfere with privacy, family, home, and correspondence. The law re-
 quires criminal police, who remain part of the internal security structure, to obtain
 a search warrant from a prosecutor before conducting a search, but they sometimes
 search without a warrant. The KNB has the right to monitor telephone calls and
 mail, but under the law it must inform the General Prosecutor's office within 24
 hours of such activity.
 
 
 993
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution and the 1991 Press Law pro-
 vide for freedom of the press, and the Government generally tolerates independent
 media; however, the media practices self-censorship. The Government continued to
 own and control most printing and distribution facilities and to subsidize periodi-
 cals, including many which were supposedly independent. The potential for Govern-
 ment control, as well as reports of pecific instances of Government officials making
 suggestions about what a journalist should and should not cover, resulted in wide-
 spread media self-censorship. The key subject considered to be "off limits" by jour-
 nalists was personal criticism of the President and government officials.
 In April the Russian newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda printed an article in
 which Russian writer Aleksandi Solzhenitsyn called for the reintegration of north-
 ern Kazakstan with Russia. The Prosecutor General's Office charged the newspaper
 with stirring up ethnic discord (a violation of Article 39 of the Constitution) and
 calling for the violation of Kazakstan's territorial integrity. The Prosecutor General
 demanded that the newspaper be suspended from publishing in Kazaktan for 6
 months and its circulation throughout the country banned. Independent journalists
 quickly called on the Medeo district court of Almaty to reject the suit as contradic-
 tory to democratic ideals. The suit was dropped in July afer the newspaper pub-
 lished a statement disassociating itself from Slahenitsyn's remarks. Circulation of
 the newspaper was not affected.
 In July a journalist for the Kaak-language service of Radio Liberty was detained
 for several hours after he admitted to police that he was on his way to cover an
 illegal demonstration" against Chinese nuclear testing. The journalist was not
 charged. He then sued the government for about $85,000 (6 million tenge) in "moral
 damages." In September the court awarded him about $140 (10,000 tenge).
 In the summer, a Russian citizen correspondent of the newspaper Izvestia, Vladi-
 mir Ardayev, was warned "unofficially" by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that for-
 eign correspondents should not interfere in internal Kazakstani affairs after he ap-
 peared on a local talk show. In September President Nazarbayev was angered by
 Ardayev's publication of a "confidential" letter from Uzbekistani President Karimov
 regarding integration within the Commonwealth of Independent States. Nazarbayev
 told the press that "Ardayev was already once driven out of Kazakstan, and if we
 drive him out again, he will never return." However, no official action was taken
 against Ardayev and he continued to live and work in Kazakstan.
 Despite these examples of official heavy-handedness, the press was generally per-
 mieto criticize government decisions. Official corruption remained an acceptable
 topic for critical coverage. Many journalists have criticized the new bicameral Par-
 liament as a "tame parliament in the President's pocket."
 Most poitical opposition rups freely issued their own publications. However, ac-
 cording to press reports in December 1995, the editor of the Republican Party news-
 paper in Kokshetau oblast (province) was arrested and sent to a mental hospital
 after he criticized the skim (governor). In addition human rights activists reported
 that Yuri-Buravlyov editor of the newspaper Era of Mercy, was detained by local
 authorities after publishing an article critical of the head of the north Kazakstan
 province administration. There are several independent newspapers that act as
 voices for the opposition, particularly Delovaya Nedelya (Business Week) and
 Novoye Pokoleniye (New Generation).
 There are many radio and television companies, both public and private, but the
 Government controls all broadcasting facilities. An association of independent broad-
 casters of Central Asia exists. However, Government officials and representatives of
 the state television corporation continued to call for a state-sponsored union of inde-
 pendent television stations.
 In October and November, several independent television and radio stations in
 Almaty had their broadcasting frequencies temporarily turned off, were told to pre-
 pare to vacate their technical offices in the state television tower, and were told that
 the frequencies they utilized would be sold to the highest bidder. The stations have
 independent news and political commentary as well as standardprogramming. With
 one exception, all of the independent electronic media continuedto broadcast after
 brief interruptions. A government tender for the frequencies was announced in De-
 cember. Bids will he accepted until January 14, 1997 and results will be announced
 on January 24, 1997. Ridders were required to pay $500 to bid. No minimum bid
 prie was established. The "" broadcasting company's television transmission from
 the television tower continued to be suspenied because of allegations that its signal
 was interferg with another independent station; Radio M  ontinued to broadcast
 on a radio cable network. Human r-ights activists and several media outlets claimed
 that these actions were part of a concerted government effort to harass and even
 
 
 994
 
 eliminate independent media. The Government denied any intent to limit free
 speech and asserted that it was acting in its own fiscal interest.
 In December the Government decided to suspend the broadcasting of the All-Rus-
 sian Television and Radio Company (RTR) into Kazakstan. Although an independ-
 ent station alleged that the decision was related to frequencies problems, the Gov-
 ernment reported that RTR's broadcasting was suspended because of a $480 million
 debt to Kazakstan.
 The law against insulting the President and other officials remained on the books
 and the Constitution provides for the protection of the dignity of the President. In
 August Nina Sidorova, the leader of an ethnic Russian political movement, was ar-
 rested and charged with insulting a prosecutor. In December Sidorova was sen-
 tenced to 2 years in prison after being found guilty of insulting officials of the court,
 .sulting, government officials, and assault and battery of court representatives.
 Sidrova's sentence was immediately suspended under a general amnesty declared
 earlier this year in conjunction with the fifth anniversary of independence.
 Several laws control advertising in the mass media. One law restricts alcohol and
 tobacco advertising on television, as well as "pornography' and "violence" during
 prime viewing hours. Another law restricts the amount of advertising in newspapers
 to 20 percent of the total material in each issue. The Minister of Justice and the
 Minister of Press and Mass Media have interpreted this law as restricting paid arti-
 cles but not commercial advertisements.
 The Government respects academic freedom.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 peaceful assembly and association, but there are significant restrictions. According
 to the law, organizations must apply to the local authorities for a permit to hold
 a demonstration or public meeting at least 10 days in advance, or the activity will
 be considered illegal. In some cases, local officials routinely issued necessary per-
 mits. However, human rights activists complained that complicated procedures and
 the 10-day notification period made it difficult to for all groups to organize public
 meetings and demonstrations. They argue that local authorities, especially those
 outside of the capital, turned down the majority of applications submitted. The press
 reported that there were numerous unsanctioned rallies of workers and pensioners
 protesting against difficult economic conditions and the nonpayment of wages and
 pensions. For the most part, no action was taken against these individuals. How-
 ever, in November the leader of Azamat, a political opposition movement, and the
 leader of an independent trade union were arrested and fined for organizing an
 unsanctioned rally intended to protest the nonpayment of wages to workers. No gov-
 ernment action was taken against the participants in the rally.
 The Kazakstani Communist Party came under government scrutiny in March
 after it sponsored unsanctioned rallies and demonstrations in support of the Rus-
 sian Duma's vote to nullify the 1991 accords that disbanded the former Soviet Union
 and founded the Commonwealth of Independent States. A number of local Com-
 munist Party chapters were fined and the national organization had difficulty re-
 newing its registration. The General Prosecutor's office called for the suspension of
 the activities of the Communist Party until the Party brought its charter (which
 calls for the reconstitution of the Soviet Union) into compliance with existing law
 by recgnizing the soverignty of Kazaktan. The Communist Party was not banned;
 however  the ethnic Russian organization   LAD" of Ust-Kamenogorsk was sus-
 pended for its part in organizingthe rallies. In November the Party agreed to revise
 its charter to acknowledge Kazakstani sovereignty. Its application for reregistration
 was submitted to the Ministry of Justice in December.
 Organizations, movements and political parties that conduct public activities, hold
 public meetings, participate in conferences, or have bank accounts must register
 with the Government. Activity by nonregistered organizations is illegal. Registration
 on the local level requires a minimum of 10 members and on the national level, a
 minimum of 10 members in at least 11 of the 19 provinces (oblasts). In addition,
 a registration fee is required, which many groups consider to be a deterrent to reg-
 istration.
 OThe Constitution prohibits political parties established on a religious basis. The
 Gvernment has refused to register ethnic-based political parties on the grounds
 that their activities could spark ethnic violence. The Constitution bans "public asso-
 ciations"--including political parties--whose "goals or actions are directed at a vio-
 lent change of the constitutional system, violation of the integrity of the Republic,
 underminng of the security of the State (and), fanning of social, racial, national,
 religious, class and tribal enmity.' Unregistered parties and movements, nonethe-
 less, hold meetings and publish newspapers. All of the major religious and ethnic
 groups have independently functioning cultural centers.
 
 
 995
 To participate in elections, a political party must register with the Government.
 Under current law, a party must submit a list of at least 3,000 members from a
 minimum of 11 oblasts. The list must provide personal information about members,
 including date and place of birth, address, anfplae of employment. For many citi-
 zens, submitting such personal data to the Government is reminiscent of the former
 Soviet KGB's tactics and inhibits them from joining parties. The nationalist Alash
 Party and the Social Democratic Party have refused to register on the principle that
 they should not have to submit personal information about their members to the
 Government. Under the law, memabers of unregistered parties may run for elected
 office as individuals, but not as party members.
 There are no pubfic statistics available regarding the number of registered public
 parties; however, all parties asking to be registered have been successful. For the
 most part political parties are very weak and, with the exception of the Communist
 Party and some of the ethnic-based political movements, have very little influence
 outside the capital. The majority of parliamenta       es are independents; par-
 ties represented in the Parliament include sever  prpresidential       the com-
 munist Party, and the Socialist Party. Most opposition party members decided not
 to participate in the December 1995 elections and are, therefore, not represented in
 the Parliament.
 The Constitution prohibits foreign political parties and foreign trade unions from
 operating in Kazakstan. In addition, the Constitution prohibits the financing of po-
 litical parties and trade unions by foreign legal entities and citizens, foreign states
 and international organizations. Some trade union associations have circumvented
 this prohibition by registering with the Government as "public organizations," in
 other words, nongovernmental organizations.
 c. Freedor of Religion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the
 various denominations worship without government interference. However, the Con-
 stitution also requires that the appointment by foreign religious centers of the heads
 of religious associations must be carried out "in coordination with the Government,"
 as must the activities of foreign religious associations. In practice the Government
 does not interfere with the appointment of religious leaders. Foreign missionaries,
 unwelcome to some Orthodox and Muslim Kazakstanis, have complained of occa-
 sional harassment by low-level government officials. In June the government-con-
 trolled television station complained that more than 2,000 Kazakstanis had been
 converted to other religions and proposed stopping foreign missionaries who were
 preaching "Christianity and Krishna ideas on our own soil." However, no action has
 ben taen against foreign missionaries working in the country.
 The Islamic mufti and the Russian Orthodox archbishop have appeared together
 to promote religious and ethnic harmony.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the County, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Constitution prvides for the right to emigrate and the right of re-
 patriation; both are respected in practice. Kazakstanis have the right to change
 their citizenship, but are not prmitted to hold dual citizenship.
 According to the Constitution, everyone who is legally present on the territory of
 the Republic has the right to move freely on its territoiy and freely choose a place
 of residence except in cases stipulated by law. This provision formally abolishes the
 "propiska" system of residence permits, a holdover from the Soviet era. However,
 in the absence of a law for most of the year to bring legal practice into line with
 the Constitution, citizens were still required to have a propiska in order to prove
 legal residence and obtain city services. Obtaining a propiska for most of the coun-
 try was generally routine. However, according to human rights activists, a bribery
 market in propisas to live in Almaty continued to exist, because of Almaty's great-
 er affluence. In August a new law replaced the propiska system with a system of
 registration for all citizens.
 There were numerous reports of government efforts to restrict the movement of
 foreigners around the country. Internal visas were commonly required for foreigners
 traveling outside the capital.
 An exit visa is required for both citizens and foreigners who wish to travel abroad,
 although refusals are rare. There have been reports of some officials demanding
 bribes for exit visas. The Government accords special treatment to ethnic Kazaks
 and their families who fled during Stalin's time and wish to return. Kazaks in this
 category are entitled to citizenship and many other privileges. Anyone else, includ-
 ing ethnic Kazaks who are not considered refugees from the Stalin era of political
 repression, such as the descendants of Kazaks who moved to Mongolia during the
 previous century, must apply for permission to return.
 The Government cooperates with the United Nations High Commissioner for Ref-
 ugees (UNHCR) and other humanitarian organizations in assisting refugees, espe-
 cially with the resettlement of ethnic Kazaks from Afghanistan now living as refu-
 
 
 996
 gees Iran. In August President Nazarbayev estimated that about 200,000 ethnic
 K       living abroad had returned over the past few years. In August representa-
 tives of the Association of Afghan Women Refu    appealed to the Government for
 fmancial assistance and protection, alleging that Alfghan refugees had been as-
 saulted. There were no reports of forced expulsion of refugees; however, there were
 complaints that the country had not yet adoptd laws regularizing the status of ref-
 ugees. The issue of the provision of first asylum has never arisen.
 At the end of 1994, Kazakstan and Russia initialed agreements that established
 broad legal rights for the citizens of one country living on the territory of the other
 and provided for expeditious naturalization for citizens of one country who moved
 to the other. These agreements were ratified by Parliament in January 1995 and
 by the Russian Duma in July.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Right&- The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Although the Constitution provides for a democratic government, in practice the
 Government infringed on the right of citizens to change their government. The Con-
 stitution concentrates power in the presidency, granting the President considerable
 control over the legislature judiciary, and local government. The Constitution can-
 not be modified or amended without the consent of the President. In 1995 President
 Nazarbayev extended his term of office to the year 2000 by referendum without a
 contested presidential election (which, according to the Constitution then in force,
 should have been held in 1996). A new, bicameral legislature took office in January
 (members were elected in December 1995). The lower house (the Majilis) consisting
 of 67 members, was elected directly. The upper house (the Senate), with 47 mem-
 bers, was elected indirectly, by members of oblast and city parliaments, 7 of its
 members are appointed by the President. The election law requires candidates for
 beth houses to meet minimum age and education requirements, and to pay a non-
 refundable registration fee of 50 times the minimum monthly wage (in December
 1995 this fee was about $500 (30,000 tenge). The law does not require Majilis can-
 didates to collect signatures in order to be placed on the ballot. Senate candidates
 are required to obtain signatures from 10 percent of the members of the local assem-
 blies in their oblasts in order to be placed on the ballot. Some consider the election
 requirements, especially the registration fee, to be a barrier to participation.
 The legislature cannot control the budget, initiate changes in the Constitution, or
 exercise oversight over the executive branch. Should Parliament fail to pass within
 30 days an "urgent" bill brought by the President, the President may issue the bill
 by decree. Whie the President has broad powers to dissolve Parliament, Parliament
 can remove the President only for disability or high treason, and only with the con-
 sent of the Constitutional Council, which is largely controlled by the President.
 Although the President maintained the right to legislate by decree, he respected
 the parliamentary procedures laid out in the Constitution. During its first session,
 Parliament passed a large number of bills and ratified several international agree-
 ments. However, the Parliament fell short in several areas. No parliamentarian ex-
 ercised the right of legislative initiative (all legislation considered by the Parliament
 was introduced by the executive), parliamentary procedures were weak and con-
 stituent relations were nonexistent. Most parliamentary activities continued to be
 conducted behind closed doors. Sessions were neither open to the public nor tele-
 vised. Duing the Pariament's seond session beginng in September, individual
 deputies drafe d and introduced several bills for consideration.
 In June the Parliament twice rejected the Government's pension reform legisla-
 tion, arguing that its constituents opposed the bill. The Government called for a vote
 of confidence. According to the Constitution, if the Government receives a vote of
 no confidence, the President can dissolve either the Government or the Parliament.
 In this case, the parliamentarians realized that, if forced to make a choice, the
 President would have chosen to dissolve the Parliament, not the Government. The
 Parliament gave the Government its vote of confidence and passed the bill.
 The Constitution significantly constrains the independence of the judiciary. The
 Constitutional Court was abolished and replaced by a Constitutional Council. Three
 of its seven members, including its chairman, are directly appointed by the Presi-
 dent. A two-thirds majority of the Counc is required to overrule a Presidential veto
 of its decisions. All judges are appointed by the President.
 According to the Constitution, the governors of oblasts (the "akims") are selected
 by the Prime Minister but serve at the discretion of the President, who may also
 annul their decisions.
 Two national political opposition movements were established in 1996, both call-
 ing for the election of provincial governors and changes in the Government's eco-
 nomic reform policies. Azamat is a movement of intellectuals dedicated to conatruc-
 
 
 997
 tive opposition. Republic is a popular front led by the Kazakstani Communist Party
 representing 20 political parties, public associations, and movements. The Govern-
 ment did not interfere with the development of either movement. However, the lead-
 ers of Azamat alleged that they were harassed by local officials while traveling
 through the countryside in the summer.
 All adult citizens have the right to vote. Membership in political parties or trade
 unions is forbidden to members of the military, employees of national security and
 law enforcement organizations, and judges.
 There are no legal restrictions on the participation of women and minorities in
 politics, but the persistence of traditional attitudes means that few women hold high
 office or play active parts in political life. There are no female federal ministers or
 provincial governors. Of 45 Senate members (2 seats were vacant in 1996), 3 are
 women; of 67 Majilis members, 9 are women.
 Although minority ethnic groups are represented in the Government, Kazaks hold
 the majority of leadership positions. Of the 21 Government ministries, 8 are headed
 by non-Kazaks. Non-Kazaks are well-represented in the Majilis and the Senate.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Helsinki Watch, the Kazakstan-American Human Rights Association, and Legal
 Development of Kazakstan are the most active of a small number of local human
 rights organizations. They cooperate on human rights and legal reform issues. Al-
 though these groups operated largely without government interference, they were
 subject to restrictions on assembly, and limted rimancial means hampered their
 ability to monitor and report human rights violations. Some human rights observers
 complained that the Government momitored their movements and telephone calls.
 There is a presidential commission on human rights in the Government. In Feb-
 ruary the Prosecutor General's Office established a "Department for Supervising the
 Protection of Human and Civil Rights." In September the Prosecutor General's Of-
 ice acknowledged that the jailed leader of an ethnic Russian political movement
 had been beaten and ordered an official investigation. However, the Government
 tended to deny or ignore charges of specific human rights abuses.
 The Government permitted international and foreign nongovernmental organiza-
 tions (NGO's) dealing with human rights issues to visit Kazakstan and meet with
 local human rights groups as well as government officials. The International Labor
 Organization, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies,
 and the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees have permanent offices in Kazakstan.
 However, the Constitution forbids 'the financing of political parties and trade
 unions by foreign legal entities and citizens, foreign states and international organi-
 zations." Further, although the Civil Code allows the registration of NGO's, require-
 ments for registration were burdensome and changed frequently. As a result, few
 NGO's were registered, leaving many without legal standing. Although some govern.
 ment officials made an effort to work with domestic and foreign NGO's, others con-
 tinued to assert that foreign NGO's promote instability.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution states "everyone is equal before law and court. No one may be
 subjected to any discrimination for reasons of origin, social position, occupation,
 property status, sex, race, nationality, language, attitude to religion, convictions,
 place of residence or any other circumstances." However, the Government does not
 effectively enforce this on a consistent basis. The Government has favored ethnic
 Kazaks in government employment and, according to many citizens, in the process
 of privatizing state enterprises.
 Women.-According to human rights groups, there is considerable domestic vio-
 lence against women. Police are often reluctant to intervene in cases of spousal
 abuse, considering it to be the family's business, unless they believe that the abuse
 is life threatening. The maximum sentence for wife beating is 3 years, but few cases
 are prosecuted. The Government has not specifically addressed the problem. Law
 enforcement authorities reported 1,905 cases of rape and adjusted 1995 figures to
 report 1,641 cases. The punishment for rape can range from 4 to 15 years. There
 is very little coverage of rape in the press, and it is generally believed that rapes
 often go unreported.
 There is no legal discrimination against women, but women are severely under-
 represented in higher positions in government and state enterprises and overrepre-
 sented in low-paying and some menial jobs. Women have unrestricted access to
 higher education.
 
 
 998
 Children.-The Government is committed in principle to children's rights, but as
 in many other areas, budget stringencies and other priorities severely limit its efrec-
 tiveness in dealing with children's issues. There is no established pattern of govern-
 mental or societal abuse against children. Rural children normally work during har-
 vests (see Section 6.d.).
 People With Disabilities.-Citizens with disabilities are entitled by law to assist-
 ance fmrom the State. There is no legal discrimination against people with disabil-
 ities, but in practice, employers do not give them equal consideration. There are
 laws mandating the provision of accessibility to public buildings and commercial es-
 tablishments for the disabled, but the Government does not enforce these laws. Dis-
 abled persons are a low priority for the Government.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minoritles.-The population of about 17 million consists
 of approximately 44 percent Kazaks and 36 percent Russians, with many other eth-
 nicgrup represented.
 The Government continued to discriminate in favor of ethnic Kazaks in govern-
 ment employment, where ethnic Kazaks predominate, as well as in education, hous-
 ing, and other areas. However, the Government has continued to back away from
 its "Kazakification- campai    of the first year of independence. President
 Nazarbayev has publicly emphasized that all nationalities are welcome, but many
 non-Kazaks are anxious about what they perceive as expanding preferences for eth-
 nic Kazaks. Many ethnic Kazaks, however, believe that such affirmative action is
 needed to reverse 200 years of discrimination.
 Most of the population speaks Russian; only about half of ethnic Kazaks speak
 Kazak fluently. According to the Constitution, the Kazak language is the state lan-
 guage. The Constitution states that the Russian language is officially used on a
 basis equal with that of the Kazak language in organizations and bodies of local
 self-administration. This slight increase in the status of the Russian language (from
 its previous status as the Republic's "language of interethnic communication*) did
 not satisfy some ethnic Russian Kazakstanis who had hoped that Russian would be
 designated as a second state language. The Government is encouraging more edu-
 cation of children in the Kazak language, but has done little to provide Kazak-lan-
 guage education for adults.
 A new language law passed by the lower house of Parliament in November and
 forwarded to the Senate for consideration actively sought to further the use of the
 Kazak language. However, the draft bill does not appropriate any funding to im-
 prove Kazak language training. Its most controversial provision authorizes the Gov-
 ernment to establish a list of government positions that could be held only by indi-
 viduals fluent in Kazak. Ethnic Kazaks would have until 2001 to attain the nec-
 essary Kazak fluency; non-Kazaks would have until 2006.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution and the current Labor Code (since
 1995 the Ministry of Labor has been in the process of drafting a new labor code,
 with input from labor representatives) provide for basic worker rights, including the
 right to organize and the right to strike. Kazakatan joined the International Labor
 n(ILO) in 1993.
 ost workers remained members of stat-sponsored trade unions established dur-
 ing the Seviet period, when membership was obligatory. At most enterprises, the
 state-spnsored unions continued to deduct 1 percent of each worker's wage as dues.
 In addition the Government withholds 30 percent of each worker's wage-85 percent
 of which is for the pension fund, 5 percent for social insurance, and 10 percent for
 health care. An additional 2 percent of each worker's wage is withheld for the unem-
 ployment fund. The state unions under the Communist system were, and for the
 most part still are, organs of the Government, and work with management to en-
 force labor discipline and to discourage workers from forming or joining independent
 unions.
 The law gives workers the right to join or form unions of their own choosing and
 to stop the automatic dues deductions for the state unions. However, enterprises
 often continue to withhold dues for the state-sponsored union in spite of requests
 from individual workers to stop the deduction. The Independent Trade Union Center
 of Kazakstan claims membership of about 500,000 out of a total work force of about
 5,600,000; however, the actual number of independent trade union members is esti-
 mated to be closer to 70,000. To obtain lega status, an independent union must
 apply for registration with the local judicia authority at the olast level and with
 the Ministry of Justice. Registration is generally lengthy, difficult, and expensive.
 The decision to register a union appears to be arbitrary, with no published criteria.
 Judicial authorities and the Ministry of Justice have the authority to cancel a
 
 
 999
 union's registration, however, there is no evidence that the Ministry of Justice has
 ever exercised this authority.
 The law does not provide mechanisms to protect workers who join independent
 unions from threats or harassment by enterprise management or state-run unions.
 Members of independent unions have been dismissed, transferred to lower paying
 or lower status jobs, threatened, and intimidated. According to union leaders, state
 unions work closely with management to ensure that independent trade union mem-
 bers are the first fired in times of economic downturn.
 A 1995 tripartite agreement between labor, management, and the Government,
 designed to help resolve labor issues and disputes, was moribund. However, in De-
 cember a new tripartite agreement was signed by the Prime Minister, business rep-
 resentatives, the eaders of the state-sponsored trade unions, and the independent
 trade union center. According to press reports, the agreement is to support the Gov-
 ernment's economic reform program. It is unclear whether this new agreement will
 e mre successful that its predecessor.
 Unions and individual workers exercised their right to strie in 1996, primarily
 in an effort to recover back wages owed to workers. Nonpaent of wages continued
 to be the priority issue for workers. Miners' strikes in the coal mining region of
 Karaganda continued throughout the year. According to legislation passed bY the
 Parliament in June, workers may exercise the right to strike only if a labor dispute
 has not been resolved by means of existing conciliation procedures. In addition, the
 law requires that employers be notified that a strike will take place no less than
 15 days before its commencement.
 As a result of their inability to pay salaries, many enterprises continued to pay
 wages in script rather than in cash,, a practice at odds with ILO Convention 95 on
 the protection of wages other than in the legal currency without the express consent
 of the workers. Enterprise  diretors claimed that the enterprises were not be'iag
 pald in cash by their traditional trading partners in other par  of the former Soviet
 Union, which were also experiencing cah flow difficulties as a result of the general
 economic crisis. The script was often not accepted at stores or was accpted only
 at devalued levels.
 By law, unions may freely join federations or confederations and affliate with
 international bodies. Most independent trade unions belong to the Independent
 Trade Union Center (ITUC) headquartered in Almaty. The Indendent      bners'
 Federation of Kazakstan, along with the State Miners' Union of  araganda, are
 members of the Miners' International Federation. The unions belonging to the ITUC
 are not members of international federations but d maintain contacts with Euro-
 pean and U.S. trade union federations. Independent unions were particularly con-
 cernd about a prvision in the Constitution that forbids the financing of trade
 unions by foreigne legal entities and citizens, foreign states, and international organi-
 zations. Since independence, independent trade unions have received financial as-
 sistance from a foreign trade union institute. However, most of this assistance ter-
 minated at the end of September when funding was reduced. Independent trade
 unions are now searching for new means of support. Some associations of trade
 unions were able to receive financing from foreign sources by registering as "public
 organizations" rather than labor unions.
 b.The Right to Organize and Bargain Conectively.-Ther   e significant limits
 on the right to organize and bargain collectively. Most large-scale enterprises re-
 mained state owned and were subject to the State's production orders. Although col-
 lective bargaining rights are not spelled out in the current law, in some instances
 unions successfully negotiated agreements with management. If a union's demands
 are not acceptable to management, it may present those demands to an arbitration
 commission composed of management, union officials, and independent technical ex-
 perts. There is no legal protection against antiunion discrimination.
 There are no export processing zones. Several free economic zones enoy all the
 privileges of export processing zones, as well as other tax privileges and abatements,
 but labor conditions there appear to be no different than elsewhere in Kazakltan.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Constitution prohibits forced
 labor xept t at the sentence of the court or in the conditions of a state of emergency
 or martial law." However, in northern Kazakstan some persons were required to
 provide labor or the  of privately owned equipment with no, or very low, com-
 pensation to help gather the annual grain harvest.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The minimum are for employment
 is 16 years. A child under age 16 may work only with the permission of the local
 administration and the trade union in the enterprise in which the child would work.
 Such permission is rarely granted Abuse of child labor is generally not a problem,
 although child labor is routinely used in agricultural areas, especially durng har-
 vest season.
 
 
 1000
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-This year the Government stopped publishing
 an official minimum wage. However, the Government used a base minimum month-
 ly wage of $7.35 (550 tenge) in the 1997 budget that was presented to the Par-
 liament in November. The Government multiplies this base minimum wage by set
 coefficients to determine monthly payments for pensions, student stipends, and
 wages. Minimum wages vary by in ustrial sector and slowly increased throughout
 1996. However, the minimum wage was far from sufficient to provide a decent living
 for a worker and family.
 In June the Parliament ratified two ILO conventions: Number 14b regarding the
 protection of workers from professional risks caused by the pollution of the air, noise
 and vibrations in the workplace; and Number 155 regarding safety and hygiene of
 the labor and industrial environment.
 The legal maximum workweek is 48 hours, although most enterprises maintained
 a 40-hour workweek, with at least a 24-hour rest period. The Constitution provides
 that labor agreements must stipulate the length of working time, vacation days,
 holidays, and paid annual leave for each worker.
 Although the Constitution provides for the right to "safe and hygienic working
 conditions," working and safet conditions in the industrial sector are substandarcL
 Safety consciousness is low. Workers in factories usually do not wear protective
 clothing, such as gggles and hard hats, and work in conditions of poor visibility
 and ventilation. Management largely ignores regulations concerning occupational
 health and safety, enforceable by the Ministry of Labor and the state-sponsored
 unions. Workers, including miners, have no legal right to remove themselves from
 dangerous work situations without jeopardy to continued employment.
