 BELGIUM
 Belgium has shared in the philosophical, political
 and social trends of Western European history over the
 last several centuries and has developed into a stable
 democratic society committed to human rights and politi-
 cal freedoms.
 It is a parliamentary democracy under a constitu-
 tional monarch, with the King as Chief of State and the
 technical source of all executive authority and the
 Council of Ministers (Cabinet) actually responsible for
 governmental decisions. The Council, led by the Prime
 Minister, holds office as long as it retains the confi-
 dence of the Parliament. Direct popular elections for
 parliamentary seats (excluding 76 of the 182 Senate
 seats apportioned by other means) are held at least
 every four years with universal suffrage, obligatory
 voting and a form of proportional representation. Bel-
 gium is a party to the 1950 European Convention for the
 Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms.
 Political freedoms and guarantees of individual
 rights are embodied in the constitution and laws and
 observed in practice. Educational levels are high as
 is public involvement in the governmental process.
 The government is committed to continue a policy of
 social benefits and of equitable distribution of econo-
 mic gains in this materially prosperous country.
 Belgium is scrupulous in observing internationally
 recognized human rights and has a long tradition of
 respect and concern for those rights.
 1.   Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a.   Torture
 Freedom from torture is guaranteed by law and respected
 in practice.
 b.   Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Freedom from cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment is
 guaranteed by law and respected in practice. Prison
 conditions are humane, with adequate physical accom-
 modations, diet and health care, provisions for family
 visits and access to attorneys.
 c.   Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 
 (OW)
 
 
 561
 Freedom from arbitrary arrest or imprisonment is
 guaranteed by law and respected in practice.
 Arrested persons must be brought before a judge within
 24 hours. Belgian law provides for pre-trial confine-
 ment only under special circumstances: when there is
 a risk that the suspect will prove a danger to the
 community or that he will flee the jurisdiction.
 Justification for such confinement is subject to
 periodic review by a panel of judges.
 d.   Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Fair public trial, including the right to counsel, is
 guaranteed in law and honored in practice.
 e.   Invasion of the Home
 Freedom from invasion of the home is guaranteed by law
 and respected in practice.
 2.   Governmental Policies Relating to the Fulfillment
 of Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care
 and Education:
 Belgium continues to enjoy one of the highest per
 capita GNP's in the world (US $10,413) and is one of
 the most affluent countries in Europe. The Government
 is committed to policies ensuring that these benefits
 are distributed equitably throughout the economy. As
 a result, the government pursues a generous wage and
 social benefits policy.
 A common public educational system serves all eco-
 nomic levels. Belgium's tax system redounds to the
 advantage of the relatively poorer classes. Women in
 Belgium hold many positions of distinction, power and
 importance in areas such as politics, business, diplo-
 macy, science, medicine, and the arts. To confront
 the longstanding problem of linguistic division between
 the Dutch-speaking North and the French-speaking South,
 detailed provisions have been made in law and govern-
 ment structure to assure equitable participation in the
 national life for both major linguistic groups. A
 long-term solution to linguistic community problems
 remains the priority goal of the government.
 3.   Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Includ-
 ing.:
 a.   Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and
 Assembly
 These freedoms are guaranteed by law and respected in
 practice.
 
 
 562
 b.   Freedom of Movement Within the Country,
 Foreign Travel and Emigration
 These freedoms are guaranteed by law and respected in
 practice.
 c.   Freedom to Participate in the Political
 Process
 Participation in the political system is open to all
 citizens. Suffrage is universal for all adults (21 or
 over), secret and compulsory. Unweighted voting (one
 person/one vote) has been in effect since 1919 and
 women's suffrage since 1948. Women are legally equal
 to men and participate freely in political, as well as
 in social and economic life, and the number active in
 these areas is growing. In the current Parliament 15
 out of 212 House seats and 22 out of 182 Senate seats
 are held by women, as are 1 of 25 national ministerial
 positions and 2 of 8 Secretary of State (subminis-
 terial) portfolios.
 Labor organization is well developed, with rights
 to organize, to bargain collectively and to strike.
 Labor unions have a significant influence in the formu-
 lation of national economic and social policy.
 4.   Government Attitude and Record Regarding Inter-
 national and Non-governmental Investigation of
 Alleged Violations of Human Rights:
 The Belgian Government's willingness and past record
 regarding independent, outside investigation of
 alleged human rights violations is exemplary. Specifi-
 cally, the Belgian Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Janu-
 ary 1977 circulated in the United Nations a proposal
 that countries should waive voluntarily the right, con-
 ferred on them by article 6(B) of resolution 1503, not
 to consent to the carrying out of an investigation con-
 cerning human rights. No requests have been made for
 outside investigation of the human rights situation in
 Belgium.
