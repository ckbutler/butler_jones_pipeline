 MALTA
 Malta is a constitutional republic with a parliamentary
 government elected on the basis of universal suffrage.
 Executive power is vested in a President who appoints as Prime
 Minister the leader of the party which gains the most seats in
 the quinquennial election for the unicameral legislature. The
 outcome of the December 1981 election, in which the
 Nationalist Party won 51 percent of the popular vote while the
 Labor Party, in part because of the redrawing of electoral
 districts, took a majority of parliamentary seats, has caused
 prolonged and persistent domestic political contention.
 The Maltese economy is dependent on export manufacturing,
 tourism, and other service industries. In 1985 Malta had a
 per capita gross national product of $3,056.
 During 1986 there were at least two allegations of police
 beatings or ill-treatment of prisoners. Several criminal
 cases, which had begun in earlier years, were dismissed by the
 courts because of police mistreatment of the accused. In
 December 1986, a police officer was found guilty of inhuman
 and degrading treatment of a detainee.
 During the campaign for the general elections, which are to
 take place by May 1987, there were a number of instances of
 political violence, including the death of one Nationalist
 Party activist.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 On December 5, 1986, Ray Caruana, a Nationalist Party
 activist, was shot and killed by an unidentified assailant at
 a Nationalist Party club in the village of Gudja. The
 Nationalist Party has charged that this shooting was
 politically motivated. Police investigations are continuing.
 b. Disappearance
 No cases of disappearance are known to have occurred.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 The Constitution prohibits inhuman or degrading punishment.
 In December 1986, the Maltese court for the first time found a
 police officer guilty of inhuman and degrading treatment of a
 person illegally arrested for a brief period in 1983.
 In another case, still before the court, two brothers have
 charged that, during a period of police interrogation in 1986,
 they were beaten and otherwise ill-treated by the police.
 There were also allegations that an Italian citizen
 incarcerated in the Maltese prison was beaten. Although
 prison guards deny the charge, other prisoners support the
 allegation. All agree that the prisoner was left naked in his
 cell during the winter. According to the Government, this was
 to prevent him from committing suicide; according to others,
 it was to humiliate him.

 MALTA
 In response to allegations that certain persons in Malta's
 prison had been beaten or otherwise treated in an inhumane
 manner, the Prime Minister appointed a distinguished retired
 judge to investigate prison conditions. This investigation
 has not been completed.
 In at least one case, begun in a previous year, the court for
 the first time ruled as inadmissible a confession signed by an
 accused on the ground that it had been obtained involuntarily
 by the use of force during police interrogation. Nevertheless,
 the accused was convicted on the basis of other evidence. No
 disciplinary action is known to have been taken against the
 police. In another case, the court, because of conditions of
 police interrogation, dismissed all charges against an accused
 who had signed a confession. In several cases, begun in
 previous years, and still before the courts, accused persons
 have charged that they were beaten and otherwise abused during
 police interrogation.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Freedom from arbitrary arrest or detention is provided for in
 the Constitution and generally respected in practice. There
 are no known political prisoners or persons in political
 exile. Any police officer above the rank of inspector may
 issue an arrest warrant without need of a court order. The
 police may, on suspicion, arrest a person for questioning.
 Within 48 hours, persons so arrested must be brought before
 the courts and charged or released. Persons being so detained
 are not entitled to legal counsel. The practice of holding
 such persons for the maximum possible period, releasing them,
 and then detaining him for further interrogation after a short
 interval, continued in 1986. A number of members of
 Parliament, from both parties, have called for a stop to this
 practice, which appears to contradict the spirit, if not the
 letter, of the law.
 The Constitution prohibits the use of any form of forced or
 compulsory labor, and this prohibition is respected in
 practice.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The Constitution guarantees a fair public trial before an
 impartial court. The judicial system is constitutionally
 independent and, in general, appears to be free from political
 pressure. However, a number of political and constitutional
 cases originating in earlier years remain unresolved. Threats
 against the independence of the judiciary, referred to in
 previous years, did not recur. However, the courts'
 jurisdiction is limited in certain areas. Lay tribunals (e.g.
 the Industrial Tribunal, the Commissioners for Justice, and
 the Inheritance Partition Tribunal) have exclusive authority
 over certain judicial functions, although their independence
 is not legally guaranteed. Defendants in cases before the
 Industrial Tribunal or the Public Service Commission may not
 be represented by lawyers. Lawyers who are members of
 Parliament may not act as counsel in cases against the
 Government, although they may act as counsel for the
 Government. Maltese citizens do not have the right of
 individual petition to the European Court of Human Rights.

 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Protection of the privacy of the home is guaranteed in the
 Constitution and respected in practice. The opposition
 continues to charge that the Government carries out telephone
 tapping, although the Government has denied these allegations.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 These freedoms are guaranteed by the Constitution and
 generally respected in practice.
 An important development in 1986 was the appointment--
 following a gap of about 4 years--of the constitutionally
 mandated broadcasting authority, a body whose primary function
 is to ensure impartiality in broadcasting. As television and
 radio are state owned, this function is of great
 significance. Two private organizations applied in 1986 for
 licences to operate radio stations; both applications were
 denied. During 1986 the Nationalist Party began a court
 action seeking a reversal of the earlier rejection by the
 Government of the Nationalist Party's application for a
 license to operate a television and radio station.
 The Foreign Interference Act, a portion of which the court
 declared during the year to be unconstitutional, makes it
 illegal for Maltese citizens or residents to participate in
 any broadcast from abroad to Malta and limits the freedom of
 speech of foreigners in Malta. Pending the outcome of the
 Government's appeal on this decision, the law remains in
 force. The act was invoked on September 22, 1986 against
 Andreas de Guttry, President of the European Young Christian
 Democrats, who had the previous day violated the law by
 addressing a Nationalist party mass meeting after his
 application to do so (required under the Foreign Interference
 Act) was denied. De Guttry was issued a summons for violating
 the law, and his departure from Malta was delayed by the
 police, acting without court sanction. His trial, in which
 the constitutionality of the Foreign Interference Act will
 again be challenged, is scheduled for December 1986. The Act
 was again invoked in November to prevent a Soviet dissident,
 who had been invited to Malta to participate in a students'
 seminar on human rights, from entering the country.
 In a case originating in 1983, in which an architect employed
 by the Public Works Department had been suspended because an
 article he had written was published in the opposition press,
 the court ruled that the suspension was politically
 discriminatory and thus unconstitutional. The Minister of
 Public Works and senior civil servants connected with the case
 were found guilty of political discrimination and were ordered
 to reinstate the architect.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The right to peaceful assembly is guaranteed in the
 Constitution. In general, police permits are given for
 political meetings and other public activities of political
 parties or groups of citizens. However, in November 1986, the
 police withdrew a permit it had earlier issued for a planned
 Nationalist Party mass meeting. The Nationalist Party sought,
 and received, a court order to allow the mass meeting to be
 
 
 980
 MALTA
 held. In fact, the mass meeting did not take place because
 the roads to the village were blocked by persons who opposed
 the meeting, and when Nationalist supporters turned up in
 large numbers, a violent confrontation occurred in which a
 number of people were injured, some by gunshot wounds, and a
 large amount of property was damaged.
 Groups which gather for the purpose of protesting government
 policies or actions have occasionally been attacked by persons
 who were apparently government supporters. The police,
 although usually present, have sometimes failed to avert
 violence. In July 1986, a group of citizens held a peaceful
 demonstration, after having obtained the required police
 permit, to protest water shortages. The police failed to stop
 opponents of the demonstration from attacking and beating a
 number of demonstrators. The Deputy Commissioner of Police,
 who was at the scene, was also attacked by one of the
 opponents of the demonstration. At least one policeman was
 later arraigned for beating some of the demonstrators. On a
 number of occasions, the police failed to restrain those
 persons who attacked and heckled speakers at public political
 gatherings of the Democratic Party.
 Trade unionists and various interest groups freely exercise
 the right to set up associations. The right to strike or take
 other industrial action, however, is not specifically
 guaranteed and has, effectively, been greatly limited for
 employees in the public sector, who constitute a large
 proportion of the work force. The General Workers Union, the
 largest labor organization, has been statutorily fused with
 the ruling Malta Labor Party since 1978. There are also
 several independent unions which since 1983 have been excluded
 from the official Maltese delegation to the International
 Labor Organization (ILO). Nevertheless, these independent
 unions have attended ILO meetings on their own. In March
 1986, the ILO Committee on Freedom of Association published a
 report charging that the Government of Malta, in violation of
 the ILO's Convention, has infringed upon the right of workers
 to organize and bargain collectively. The Committee
 recommended that the Government of Malta establish joint
 negotiating machinery for public service employees and called
 upon the Government "to give effect to the principles of
 freedom of association concerning the avoidance of a climate
 of violence involving attacks of trade unionists and trade
 union property."
 c. Freedom of Religion
 The right to practice the religion of one's choice is
 constitutionally guaranteed and respected, The overwhelmingly
 dominant religion is Roman Catholicism, although there are
 small numbers of people who belong to other religions. In
 1986 the strained relationship between the Government and the
 Roman Catholic Church improved considerably. The Holy See
 appointed a Nuncio, whose arrival in February 1986 ended an
 8-year period of strained and lower-level diplomatic
 relations. An interim agreement was reached and signed in
 July on the financing and operation of church-sponsored
 private schools. Under the terms of agreement, the Government
 is providing significant financial assistance to these schools
 while negotiations aimed at reaching a definitive agreement
 continue.
 
 
 981
 MALTA
 Two longstanding cases involving church property and schools
 were still not resolved definitively.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 There are no restrictions on movement within the country,
 foreign travel, or emigration. Maltese emigrants who return
 to Malta are not automatically entitled to regain their
 Maltese citizenship but must apply to the office of the Prime
 Minister. In most cases such applications are acted upon
 favorably. Malta does not take in or repatriate refugees.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Political activity and partisan feelings run high in Malta.
 In the last parliamentary elections (1981), more than 95
 percent of registered voters actually voted. In that
 two-party contest the Nationalist Party, although it received
 a majority of the popular votes, failed to win a majority of
 parliamentary seats. While this anomalous outcome is
 constitutionally possible, the Nationalist Party has charged
 that the most fundamental right, that of citizens to change
 their Government, is threatened. The next elections must be
 held not later than May 1987, and campaigning by both the
 Labor and Nationalist Parties, as well as the newly-formed
 Democratic Party, is under way. Meetings of the Parliamentary
 Select Committee, established in 1985 for the purpose of
 reaching an agreement on the voting system, broadcasting, and
 a number of other related issues, were suspended in 1986
 without having achieved any concrete results. However,
 prospects for a settlement of these issues were under review
 in Parliament. TV Malta is transmitting a series of political
 broadcasts, sponsored by the broadcasting authority. The
 Electoral Commission (members of which were appointed during
 1986 following a period during which the commission had
 languished), is in the process of updating electoral district
 boundaries and carrying out other responsibilities in
 connection with the upcoming elections.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged violations
 of Human Rights
 The indigenous human rights group, HIELSA, continues to be
 active in pointing out alleged human rights violations. There
 is also a Maltese branch of the International Society for
 Human Rights. Although those segments of the press which are
 sympathetic to the Government frequently criticize HIELSA, the
 Government has not prevented this organization from
 functioning, and its charges are frequently reported in
 several prominent newspapers. Several international human
 rights organizations voiced criticisms to which the Government
 is not known to have responded.
 The International Center for the Independence of Judges and
 Lawyers, commenting in November 1986 on the church schools
 case (noted above), has censured the Government of Malta "for
 seriously undermining the independence of the judiciary and
 damaging public confidence in the courts."

 MALTA
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 According to the Constitution, a fundamental aim of the
 Government is to make available the highest levels of
 education and social welfare to all citizens. Both the
 Government and opposition support citizens' basic rights to
 own property, to work with just conditions and remuneration,
 to maintain a standard of living adequate for health and
 well-being, and to receive universal education. Public
 economic and social services are extended on a
 nondiscriminatory basis. However, charges persist of partisan
 favoritism in the allocation of public housing, telephone
 services, and import and export licenses.
 Women may participate freely in social and political life,
 although they are underrepresented in politics, the
 professions, and management. Modifications in certain laws,
 debated in Parliament during 1986 but not yet enacted, as well
 as a dramatic increase in the number of women attending the
 University of Malta, the country's only institution of higher
 education, are expected to increase the proportion of women in
 positions of leadership in both the public and private sectors.
 CONDITIONS OF LABOR
 The minimum age for the employment of children is 16.
 Although Maltese law guarantees acceptable conditions of work,
 including minimum wages, maximum hours of work, and provision
 for occupational safety and health, disputes about workers'
 conditions are dealt with by an industrial tribunal and not
 the law courts. Proceedings of the Industrial Tribunal, in
 which complainants may not be represented by legal counsel,
 have been described in the International Helsinki Federation
 of Human Rights report as "unjust" because of a number of
 decisions by the Tribunal in which workers' rights were not
 considered to have been adequately protected.
 Maltese law specifies that there can be no wage disparity
 between men and women. While there is thus no wage
 discrimination, women, upon marrying, lose any previously
 accrued pension benefits.
