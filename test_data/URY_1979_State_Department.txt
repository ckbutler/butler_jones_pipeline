 URUGUAY
 Uruguay has traditionally been a democracy with advanced
 social policies. However, in the mid-60s, a period of
 national malaise that reflected two decades of economic
 stagnation culminated in urban terrorism by the Tupamaros,
 a Marxist oriented group. Civil institutions had great
 difficulty in coping with this challenge. In reaction
 to these developments, in early 1972 a National Security
 Law was passed. This law and subsequent legislation suspended
 or curbed individual liberties, expanded police and military
 powers and shifted national security cases to military
 courts, although the Constitution still provided a civil
 rights watchdog role for the Congress.
 Increasing disagreement between the Legislative Branch
 and the Armed Forces over the conduct of the anti-terrorist
 campaign (which included disappearances, torture and arbitrary
 arrests) and consequent pressure from the military led
 to closure of the elected Congress in June, 1973. The
 trend after June 1973 was toward de facto military rule.
 The Constitutionally-elected President governed by decree
 in cooperation with the Armed Forces until displaced by
 the military in June, 1976. Since then the Armed Forces
 have exercised control over a "civil-military government".
 With democratic institutions largely in suspense, the anti-
 terrorist campaign was conducted with little regard for
 individual rights. The period since 1975-76 has been marked
 by suppression of political activities, de facto suspension
 of political parties, "proscription" of hundreds of political
 leaders, severe restriction of freedom of expression, loss
 of independence of the judiciary, and intimidation of the
 legal profession. There have been large numbers of detentions
 on political grounds, and until recently, torture and other
 forms of mistreatment of political detainees during interrogation.
 The 1972-1973 campaign against-the Tupamaros resulted
 in their virtual elimination and was followed by a lull
 in counter-terrorist activity. However, a more intense
 wave of security arrests began in 1975 and crested in mid-
 1977. It concentrated on Communists and far-left activists,
 of whom many appear to have been arrested for participating
 in political activities which were constitutionally protected
 when carried out. Others arrested, including lawyers,
 journalists, labor leaders and educators, had little or
 no apparent connection with politics.
 Although the authoritarian system remained in place,
 during 1979 there was a notable decline in substantiated
 reports of new political arrests and instances of prisoner
 mistreatment. Continuing prisoner releases, the majority
 before completion of sentence, coupled with a reduction
 in new arrests, resulted in a decrease in the overall number
 of political prisoners from about 1,900 to 1,500. These
 figures include at least 300 convicted of violent crimes.
 Nonetheless, Uruguay still has a high per capita ratio
 of political detainees to general population.

 The Government has continued to pursue an economic
 program of austerity and reform designed to provide a stronger
 and more efficient economy. Despite the array of available
 social services, lower-income groups, with their discretionary
 income eroded by inflation and reduced by deflationary
 policies, are probably more affected, although there is
 otherwise no economic discrimination against any political,
 religious or social group.
 Although there have been few reforms in the area of
 civil and political rights, government figures, spokesmen
 for the major traditional parties, and the media have begun
 to address these problems with increasing openness. Civil
 and military authorities have pledged, since August 1977
 that- constitutional order and civil rule will be restored
 in 1981. An important institutionalized role for the armed
 forces is anticipated. The Government is preparing a new
 Constitution to be submitted to a plebiscite in November,
 1980. This will be followed by Presidential and legislative
 elections in 1981. It is not yet clear whether more than
 a single presidential candidate will be permitted. Partici-
 pation by some leaders of the traditional parties'may also
 be restricted.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Includinq_
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 .Uruguayan military authorities have recently completed
 apparently effective internal measures to stop the use
 of torture. It was used extensively during interrogation
 from 1972-1977 in the cases of suspected Tupamaro terrorists
 and, later, against Communist Party members, leftists,
 and other political opponents. Methods-used included electric
 shock, immersion of the head in water and severe beatings.
 Fewer reports of torture were received in 1978 and still
 fewer in 1979.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 Intimidation of detainees through psychological abuse
 during interrogation continued in 1979, although there
 was increasing evidence that the military had curbed such
 abuses. In the past, prisoners reportedly had often been
 isolated, hooded, threatened or kept standing for extended
 periods, and confined in areas under constant illumination.
 The police halted such practices in 1978.
 New prisoners are kept incommunicado during the interro-
 gation phase. Although this once may have lasted up to
 
 
 414
 several months, the trend since 1978 has been toward much
 shorter periods. Notice of arrest, whereabouts and state
 of health is not normally provided to family members at
 this stage. Most reports of political disappearances stem
 from this period of incommunicado detention but, in the
 vast majority of cases, the prisoner has reappeared within
 a few days or weeks. The prisoner is then transferred
 to a regular detention facility where treatment improves
 markedly. During 1979 this process accelerated, allowing
 for earlier notification of families and access to defense
 counsel.
 Conditions of detention appear to be somewhat better
 for political detainees than for common criminals. Supervision
 is strict, but prisoners are not normally mistreated.
 Although a few reports of harassment were received during
 1979, Amnesty International has concluded that "... no
 direct physical torture (occurs) in the prisons themselves".
 However, it goes on to add that "... harrassment and abuse
 of authority do occur". In a few cases this had anti-Semitic
 overtones and the guards involved were reportedly disciplined.
 Health care and diet appear to be adequate. Prisoners
 are permitted 45 minutes with visitors (family, attorney)
 every 15 days, to send and receive one letter a week, to
 receive one small parcel every 15 days, and to receive
 funds for canteen purchases. The International Committee
 of the Red Cross did not have access to prisoners in 1979.
 c. Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 Habeas corpus and other Constitutional guarantees
 against -arbi-trary detention have been effectively suspended
 in security cases.   Uruguayan authorities insist that
 there are no "political prisoners", and that all "national
 security prisoners" were arrested for common crimes or
 subversive activities.   However, the definition of subversive
 activity has been expanded to include offenses such as
 "undermining the morale of military forces" and "disrespect
 to military authorities".
 Uruguayan Government statistics released during 1979
 indicate that slightly fewer than 6;000 persons had been
 turned over to the military justice system since April
 1972. Almost 1,300 were subsequently released without
 trial, and over 3,000 others freed by judicial order for
 various reasons (many conditionally). This left about
 1,600 still under jurisdiction of the military justice
 system in mid-1979, either awaiting completion of trials,
 or serving sentences. Releases have since continued at
 a rate which permitted a decline in the number of prisoners
 to about 1,500 by the end of 1979. A small number of persons,
 fewer than 50 at any given time, are also detained without
 formal charges under Emergency Security Measures. Although
 somewhat lower than estimates by human rights organizations
 
 
 415
 such as Amnesty International (which estimated that 2,500-
 2,800 were being held in early 1979), there is significant
 independent evidence to support the Uruguayan Government's
 figures. Of the 1,600 prisoners remaining in mid-1979,
 and about 1,500 at year end, a certain number, once estimated
 by military authorities at about 300 have been accused
 or convicted of violent crimes, and many others of lesser
 but related offenses. However, in the absence of adequate
 guarantees by the military trial system, one cannot be
 certain that these convictions were appropriate in any
 given case.
 In December 1978, Uruguayan security forces helped
 abduct in Brazil, and forcibly repatriate to Uruguay, two
 Uruguayan United Nations-sponsored refugees and the two
 children of one of them.  (The children were subsequently
 returned to their grandparents.) No such incidents are
 known to have occurred in 1979.
 d. Denial of Pair Public Trial
 The Uruguayan court system under both the Ordinary
 Penal Code (OPC) and the Military Penal Code (MPC) relies
 on written proceedings in pretrial investigation, arraignment,
 trial, and sentencing. Terrorism, subversion, non-violent
 political offenseS, and other "crimes against the nation"
 are subject to adjudication under the MPC. Confessional
 evidence, frequently obtained under severe physical and
 psychological pressure, has usually been the basis for
 convictions. The judge, civil or military, decides on
 the basis of written briefs, and often confronts the accused
 only on arraignment and when sentencing. The evidence,
 arguments and records are normally closed to the public
 and the press. The MPC appeals process provides for a
 public hearing and, during 1979, military legal authorities
 have frequently permitted and even encouraged media coverage,
 especially in the more celebrated cases.
 The Military Justice System remains secretive and
 arbitrary, seriously limiting the rights and ability of
 the accused to mount an effective defense. More rapid
 processing has allowed earlier access by prisoners to
 counsel, accelerated judidial processing and improved commun-
 ication with families.. Amnesty International concluded
 in 1979 that "...the lack of separation of (government)
 powers has eliminated all safeguards against unlawful detention
 ... and effectively prevents any remedies for such infringements
 of basic human fights ...."
 Standards governing admissibility of evidence, especially
 confessional evidence, are less rigorous under the MPC
 than the OPC and attorneys have less opportunity for an
 effective defense. The Emergency Security Measures require
 that detainees be turned over to a military judge within
 ten days (the OPC requires a formal charge within 24 hours
 and the initiation of proceedings within 48). In practice,
 however, there have been lengthy delays.
 
 
 416
 During 1979, Uruguayan authorities have continued
 efforts to speed the work of the military court system,
 reducing the number of new cases involving significant
 pre-arraignment delay. Cases awaiting preliminary sentence
 have declined by half, to about 400. Accelerated review
 of cases has reduced the total of prisoners awaiting indict-
 ment to about 100, and has permitted many to be granted
 early release. Nonetheless, the system is still characterized
 by extensive backlogs and administrative inefficiencies
 which unduly delay processing.
 Attorneys do not have access to their clients during
 pre-trial investigations under either the MPC or OPC.
 Once the accused is turned over to a military judge for
 possible arraignment, under the MPC lawyers may see their
 clients in the presence of the authorities. They may see
 them in private under the OPC. Counsel do not have full
 access to evidence under the MPC.
 Detainees are free to choose their own counsel, but
 find few civilian lawyers are willing to plead cases before
 military courts. Thus they generally opt to be represented
 by a court-appointed public defender, who may be a civilian
 attorney or a military officer familiar with courts martial
 procedure. In any event, defense counsel are limited by
 the system largely to sentence-bargaining and pleading
 for early release. There are no known cases where an accused
 subversive, once indicted, has been acquitted under the
 MPC.
 Approximately 500 detainees were released in 1977,
 600 more-in 1978, and another 600 during 1979. Most were
 freed under a variety of pardon, parole and other early
 release programs. A trend has been noted toward augmentation
 of sentences by the Supreme Military Tribunal acting as
 a mandatoryreview court. Many such prisoners then were
 paroled some months after the Tribunal's ruling. A prisoner
 on parole may be denied the right to travel, may experience
 difficulty in finding work, and may be rearrested for parole
 violation. Persons detained under the military justice
 system sometimes continue to be held under Emergency Security
 Measures, or are rearrested on new charges after completing
 their sentences.
 There have been no verified instances of summary execution.
 From 20 to 30 deaths of prisoners occurred under questionable
 circumstances between 1972 and 1977. There have been no
 substantiated allegations of such deaths during 1978 and
 1979.
 e. Invasion of the Home
 Guarantees of inviolability of the home of persons
 suspected of terrorism, subversion, or other crimes against
 the nation are suspended under the current Emergency Security
 Measures but they still are respected in non-security cases.
 
 
 Invasions of homes by security forces were infrequent in
 1978 and 1979.
 2. Governmental Policies Relating to the Fulfillment of
 Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care and
 Education
 Per capita income for this generally middle-class
 country is over $1,600. The right of private property
 is well established and adequately protected. Low mortality
 rates and other favorable health indices continue. Despite
 inflation, occasional shortages and continuing decline
 in real wages, most of the population is well fed. There
 are various government-sponsored social assistance programs
 for the poor, housing is generally adequate, and the government
 has allocated substantial resources to subsidized housing
 for the middle and lower income groups. Health care is
 accessible to the entire population; it is free to the
 poor and available at nominal cost to others. Public educational
 opportunities through the university level are accessible
 to all.
 Development efforts in recent years have focused on
 agriculture and industry, whose past stagnation made it
 difficult to sustain income levels and social programs.
 Uruguay's recent husterity program, involving far-reaching
 budgetary and tax measures, has been accomplished at a
 social cost which lower income groups are least able to
 bear. Government corruption is not widespread, although
 there are occasional unconfirmed allegations of corrupt
 practices by individual officials, some of them prominent.
 3. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and
 Asse ml
 The press continues to be greatly restricted. In
 1979 there was growing tolerance for controversial news
 and more liberal editorial comment on hitherto forbidden
 topics, such as constitutional, judicial-and political
 party reform. Critical discussion of Uruguayan Government
 actions, limited primarily to the economic.sphere, is still
 cautious and restrained. No unfavorable comment on the
 Armed Forces is tolerated. The printed and electronic
 media operate under a system of self-censorship with general
 guidelines established by the authorities. Under the Emergency
 Security Measures, no discussion of the Government's anti-
 subversive activities is permitted beyond official releases.
 No major official actions against the press were recorded
 in 1979, although temporary closings and expulsions of
 journalists from Uruguay occurred in previous years. There
 
 
 418
 have been few recent instances of threatened sanctions.
 The threat of adverse government action remains a major
 determinant of the nature of media coverage.
 One particularly controversial incident was the arrest
 in November of a Blanco Party activist who, in a letter
 to a newspaper, had protested slanted coverage of a meeting
 of center-Democratic parties in Spain attended by representatives
 of his own party. His challenge resulted in immediate
 arrest on charges of defaming the Armed Forces. He was
 released on December 24, after thirty days of imprisonment.
 The Government respects constitutional guarantees
 of religious freedom, although there have been conflicts
 over political issues with liberal church-affiliated groups
 and, continuing through 1979, forced dismissals of teachers
 in church-run and other private schools. Religious publications
 are also subjected to self-censorship guidelines.
 The right of assembly, although still controlled,
 is somewhat less severely restricted than previously.
 Overtly political meetings are prohibited and a Blanco
 gathering in November which allegedly transcended those
 bounds resulted in the interrogation of participants and
 the detention of four retired military officers. Three
 or these officers were released after 30 days confinement;
 the release of the fourth was expected when he completed
 the same "period of detention." The traditional, non-Marxist
 parties have sponsored a few memorial events without incurring
 reprisals. .Meetings and the elections of officers of all
 clubs and organizations require advance approval, but obviously
 non-political activities are generally conducted without
 interference.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel and Emigration
 There are no general restrictions on movement within
 Uruguay, foreign travel or emigration. The Government
 however, has normally denied political detainees their
 constitutional right to leave the country rather than serve
 sentences. Foreign travel, emigration, and the renewal
 of passports for citizens living overseas have also been
 denied to persons suspected of past or present "undesirable
 association".
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process.
 Freedom to participate in an open political process
 does not now exist. Institutional Act No. 4 of 1976 deprived
 thousands of persons, including several hundred acknowledged
 leaders of the traditional political parties, of their
 political rights for up to 15 years. While political party
 headquarters remain open, and they retain elected officers,
 they cannot engage in political activity. In March 1979,
 
 
 419
 the Government designated an eight-man commission to administer
 the assets of the National (Blanco) Party, removing control
 from the existing elected leadership.
 Women in Uruguay enjoy considerable independence and
 are accorded equality before the law. They regularly attend
 the university and pursue professional careers. Nonetheless,
 traditional social patterns tend to restrict employment
 opportunities in many cases, and equality of pay is often.
 not granted.
 All Marxist-controlled labor unions were dissolved
 in 1973, and the activities of remaining unions severely
 curtailed. Official approval was required for all meetings,
 agendas and the election of officers, organizing activity
 and collective bargaining were severely restricted, and
 the right to strike effectively suspended. The Government
 has now prepared legislation liberalizing union activity.
 A draft was presented to the International Labor Organization
 (ILO) in 1979, and submitted for comment to local workers
 and employer groups. It was submitted to the Council of
 State in December. In the interim, authorities continued
 to permit significantly increased training, organizing
 activities and collective bargaining.
 Institutional Act No. 7, adopted in July 1977, gives
 the Government sweeping authority to discharge public employees,
 previously guaranteed virtually-permanent job security.
 The Act has been used largely to dismiss employees suspected
 of subversive political beliefs, often on the basis of
 flimsy evidence. Well over a thousand persons have been
 fired since July, 1977, many from the educational system.
 Those retained are expected to execute a form of loyalty
 oath, certifying their "faith in democracy".
 4. Government Attitude and Record Regarding International
 and Non-Gouprnmental Investiqation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Attitudes toward investigation of alleged human rights
 violations have varied considerably over time. In 1974,
 Amnesty International and the International Commission
 of Jurists were permitted to make a joint on-site investigation.
 Until 1976, the International Committee of the Red Cross
 was able to visit prisoners. However, the Government then
 came to view the activities of all international human
 rights groups as inimical to its interests and adopted
 a hostile attitude. Two on-site investigations by the
 International Labor Organization (ILO), the most recent
 in 1977, were exceptions. Hostility was particularly intense
 toward Amnesty International and the Organization of American
 States' Inter-American Human Rights Commission (IAHRC).
 The competence and responsibility of the latter were attacked
 despite the Commission's established role in the Inter-
 American system.
 
 
 420
 Beginning in 1978, and continuing through 1979, the
 Uruguayan Government has adopted a more moderate attitude.
 It continues to cooperate with the ILO. The UN Human Rights
 Commission, of which Uruguay is a member, is considering
 the situation of human rights in Uruguay under its confidential
 1503 procedures. However, the Government still opposes
 the scheduling of a visit requested by the IAHRC. The
 United Nations Human Rights Committee, which monitors the
 implementation of the International Covenant on Civil and
 Political Rights, concluded in August that Uruguay had
 violated several provisions of the Coverant in connection
 with the detention of Jose Luis Massera and three members
 of his family. The OAS General Assembly in October passed
 a resolution noting that "the number of denunciations about
 human rights in Uruguay has diminished in quantitative
 terms, but very many of the problems described by the (Inter-
 American Human Rights) Commission still serious," and "reiterated
 its appeal to the Government of Uruguay for comprehensive
 implementations of the recommendations made by the commission
 in its 1978 report".
 Contact was resumed in 1979 with the International
 Committee of the Red Cross concerning possible resumption
 of its activities on behalf of prisoners. In September
 a working-level Commission was named to negotiate final
 details with ICRC representatives. These were apparently
 completed during December, and Red Cross prisoner visits
 were expected to resume in early 1980.
 In August 1979, Chiefs of Diplomatic Missions accredited
 to Uruguay were invited to visit the two prisons where
 almost all political detainees are confined. They inspected
 all facilities and had private conversations with about
 50 inmates. Subsequently, greater access to prisoners,
 including dual nationals, has been permitted to interested
 embassies. Other organizations, such as UNESCO and Committees
 of the National Academy of Sciences, the New York Academy
 of Sciences and B'nai B'rith, maintained dialogues with
 the Uruguayan Government. Sensitivity to the concerns
 expressed in April 1978 by an American Bar Association
 mission continues to be shown by the Government in administering
 the military justice system.
