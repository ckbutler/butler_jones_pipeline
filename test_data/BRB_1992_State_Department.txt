 BARBADOS
 Barbados, a member of the Commonwealth of Nations, is a constitutional democ-
 racy with a multiparty, parliamentary form of Government. Barbadians recognize
 the Queen of England as Head of State; she is represented locally by an appointed
 Governor General. The Prime Minister is the Head of Government and governs with
 an appointed Cabinet. Barbados has a bicameral Parliament, consisting of an upper
 house (Senate) and a lower House of Assembly. National elections, which were last
 held in January 1991, were contested by two major political parties, an offshoot of
 the government party, and several independent candidates. Prime Minister
 Sandiford, leader of the Democratic Labour Party (DLP), was reelected at that time
 for a maximum 5-year term.
 The Royal Barbados Police Force is charged with maintaining public order, on the
 whole, it respects constitutional and legal guarantees of human rights. However, the
 police force has faced difficult challenges in recent years due to rising unemploy-
 ment and accompanying crime, violence and increased activity by youth gangs. Po-
 lice morale and public respect for the security forces have suffered. In mid-1992, in
 response to widespread charges of police brutality, the Commissioner of Police initi-
 ated new rules to govern the behavior of all policemen toward the public. The small
 volunteer Barbados Defense Force is responsible for national security, but is used
 to maintain public order in times of crisis, emergency, or other specific need. Accord-
 ing to the U.S. Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, total military expenditures
 for 1989 were $10 million. There are no plans to reduce these expenditures in the
 near future.
 The country's economy, based on agriculture, tourism, light manufacturing, and
 services, is highly susceptible to external economic developments. The full impact
 of measures instituted to meet an International Monetary Fund (IMF) stabilization
 roam hit in late 1991. The measures increased tensions and social unrest and
 ed to widespread acts of petty as well as serious, violent crimes which continued
 throughout 1992.
 Barbados has a long record of generally respecting human rights; the apparent
 growing use of force by police in questioning criminal suspects is a significant excep-
 tion.

 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of such
 kill*ngs
 b._iappearanc.-There were no reports of disappearance.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution specifically prohibits torture and cruel, inhuman, or degrading
 treatment or punishment. However, the local press has reported that a very high
 percentage of convictions is based on confessions in Barbados. There have been cred-
 ible reports that harsh treatment by law enforcement officials during incarceration
 may be used to extract confessions. One case reported in the media in April con-
 cerned a 17-year-old horse groom who died of injuries allegedly sustained while in
 police custody. Some reports say he was a drug dealer who was badly beaten after
 his arrest, then died in the hospital.
 After several publicized reports of police extracting forced confessions and beating
 suspects, the Commissioner of Police condemned 'the use of unauthorized force" by
 police officers and admitted that "serious allegations of the persistent use of unau-
 thorized force and other excesses are being made against the police force." The Com-
 missioner directed that suspects and other persons held by the police can only be
 questioned at a police station, except when expressly permitted by a senior divi-
 sional officer. An officer must visit a detainee at least once every 3 hours to inquire
 about the detainee's condition. After 24 hours, a written report of the detainee must
 be submitted to the Deputy Commissioner. All movements of a detainee between
 stations must be approved and recorded.
 The punishment by flogging with a cat-o'-nine-tails was reintroduced for heinous
 crimes in a controversial 1990 court decision. It drew immediate protests from
 human rights advocates. In September 1992, the Barbados Court of Appeals found
 the use of the "cat" unconstitutional and banned it. Although several criminals were
 sentenced to be flogged between the 1990 and 1992 decisions, these sentences were
 not carried out.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution prohibits arbitrary ar-
 rest and imprisonment, and requires detainees to be brought before a court of law
 within 72 hours of arrest. These provisions are generally respected in practice, and
 guidelines set forth in mid-1992 by the Police Commissioner specify methods of de-
 tention, set down procedures for reporting such arrests, and require disclosure of the
 condition of the detainee to senior police officers. Criminal defendants have the right
 to counsel, and attorneys have ready access to their clients.
 Exile is not used as a punishment or means of political control.
 e. Denial of Fair Public TriaL-The Constitution provides that persons charged
 with criminal offenses be given a fair public hearing within a reasonable time by
 an independent and impartial court. 'The judicial system provides for rights to due
 process at each level. Defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty. The
 Government provides free legal aid to the indigent. The judiciary acts independently
 and is free of intervention from other branches of Government. It is not an offense
 to criticize the Government, nor are there any political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Government does not routinely interfere in the private lives of its citizens. The Con-
 stitution prohibits arbitrary entry, search, or seizure, and the law requires warrants
 to be issued before privately owned property may be entered and searched. There
 are credible reports, however, that in response to increased drug-related crime, the
 police have resorted to searches of homes in certain neighborhoods in Barbados,
 sometimes without a warrant.
 In January police searched the home and office of the president of a newly formed
 trade union, apparently with a search warrant based on information alleging the "il-
 legal handling of firearms," although none was found. The search gave rise to
 charges of political harassment andled to calls for an investigation of government
 involvement. No investigation took place, and the union president took the case to
 court, where it awaited a hearing set at year's end.
 The Government neither censors mail nor restricts the receipt of foreign cor-
 respondence or publications.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech
 and press, and these rights are respected in practice. There are five radio stations,
 two of which are owned by the Government. The Caribbean Broadcasting Corpora-
 tion (CBC) television service (the only television source, excluding direct satellite re-
 ception) is government-owned. Though CBC is a state enterprise, views opposing
 
 
 333
 government policies are regularly reported, although opposition political figures oc-
 casionally claim their positions are given little attention. There are two independent
 daily newspapers, both of which present opposition political views. The Government
 regularly comes under attack in the newspapers and on daily call-in radio programs.
 SBarbados is the site of the Cave Hll campus of the University of the West Indies;
 academicians across the poltica] spectrum express their views freely.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Assocation.-The Government observes the
 constitutional guarantees of peaceful assembly and private association. Permits re-
 quired for public demonstrations continue to be routinely granted. Political parties,
 trade unions, and private organizations function and hold meetings and rallies with-
 out government hindrance.
 c.Treedom of Religion.-There is full freedom of religion. While the Anglican and
 Methodist faiths have traditionally predominated, there are numerous other active
 religious denominations and organizations throughout the country, including
 Rastafarians. Foreign missionaries of various faiths proselytize freely.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.--Citizens and legal residents move freely within Barbados and leave and
 enter the country without restriction.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens have this right in law and exercise it in practice. Political parties freely
 compete in fair elections by secret ballot at least every 5 years. There are no impedi-
 ments to participation in the political process, and all Barbadians over age 18 may
 vote. The present Democratic Labor Party (DLP) Government, in power since 1986,
 won the January 1991 election with a reduced majority of 18 out of the 28 seats
 in the House of Assembly. The main opposition party, the Barbados Labor Party
 (BLP), won 10 seats. A Cabinet of ministers appointed by the Prime Minister exer-
 cises executive power, balanced by the bicameral Parliament and judiciary system.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Local groups involved with human rights matters operate freely, without govern-
 ment hindrance. No international or local human rights groups have requested any
 human rights investigations. The Caribbean-wide human rights organization, Carib-
 bean Rights, has its eadquarters and a small staff in Barbados, and investigates
 and reports on allegations of human rights violations throughout the region when
 warranted.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Language, or Social Status
 The Constitution provides for equal treatment under the law, regardless of race,
 religion, or sex. These provisions are generally respected in practice. Women ac-
 tively participate in all aspects of national life and are well represented at all except
 the uppermost levels of both the public and private sectors. Women form a large
 percentage of heads of household and are not discriminated against in public hous-
 ing or other social welfare programs. There is some evidence, however, that women
 are not paid equally with men for work of equal value (see Section 6.e.). Compulsory
 education through the secondary level is enforced uniformly. Women's rights groups
 exist; they are devoted primarily to promoting women's participation in the profes-
 sions and, to a lesser extent, to safequarding legal rights of Megitimate children.
 Women a rights groups, supported in principle by appropriate government min-
 istries, singled out violence against women and children as a significant social prob-
 lem in Barbados during 1992. According to press reports and women's and childrens'
 rights groups, domestic violence, incest, and rape among family members is increas-
 ing. In November a father was convicted of manslaughter in the beating death of
 his 2-year-old daughter. The courts sentenced some men from 3 years to life for
 crimes such as incest and agpavated rape with sodomy, while acquitting others.
 Human rights monitors criticized this inconsistency in sentencing, which is often
 left to the discretion of the judge. The courts tended to sentence criminals to longer
 prison terms for petty theft than for rape, assault, or incest charges.
 There are public and private counseling services available for domestic violence,
 rape, suicide, and child abuse. A domestic violence and sexual assault bill became
 law on January 28. The bill, which specifies the appropriate police response to do-
 mestic violence, aims to protect all members of the family, including men and chil-
 dren, and applies to common law relationships as well as marriage.
 Criminal penalties for violent crimes are the same regardless of sex of offender
 or victim. In cases of domestic violence, courts typically issue restraining orders if
 requested by the victim, the breach of which is punishable by a jail sentence. In
 1992 local courts heard a number of cases of domestic violence against women in-
 
 
 volving assault or injury, although women's rights groups point out that there is
 still some reluctance on the part of victims to report such incidents.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Workers in Barbados have the right to form and be.
 lons to trade unions and to strike and freely exercise these rights. There are two
 major unions and several smaller ones, representing various sectors of labor. The
 largest union, the Barbados Workers' Union (BWU), has historically been closely as-
 sociated with the governing DLP, with BWU officers holding elected parliamentary
 seats and an appointed Senate seat. However, in 1991 and 1992 the union distanced
 itself from the party and the Government due to austerity measures which reduced
 BWU membership and increased unemployment and hardship among workers. The
 civil service union, the National Union of Public Workers (NUPW), is independent
 of any political party or the Government.
 Trade unionists' personal and property rights are given full protection under law.
 Strikes are prohibited only in the water and electric utilities and among the security
 forces; all other private and public sector employees are permitted to strike. There
 was more industrial action in 1991 and 1992 than in most other postindependence
 years, largely due to the severe cutbacks in personnel in the private sector, the
 planned privatization of state-run enterprises, and wage cuts and layoffs within the
 public sector. During this period of economic crisis, an informal coalition of trade
 unions and staff associations was formed to bargain collectively with the Govern-
 ment on issues affecting them all. This coalition is expected to be formally des-
 ignated as the BarbadosLabor Federation.
 Barbadian trade unions are free to form federations and are in fact affiliated with
 a variety of regional and international labor organizations. The main regional labor
 organization, the Caribbean Congress of Labor, has its headquarters in Bridgetown
 and conducts many of its seminars in Barbados.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The rights to organize and
 to bargain collectively are provided by law and respected in practice. Over 25 per-
 cent of the working population is organized, and wages and working conditions are
 negotiated through the collective bargaining process. Employers have no legal obli-
 gation to recognize unions under the Trade Union Act of 1964, but most do when
 a majority of their employees signify a desire to be represented by a registered
 union. While there is no specific law prohibiting antiunion discrimination, the regu-
 lar courts provide a method of redress for employees alleging unfair dismissal. The
 courts commonly award monetary compensation but rarely order reemployment.
 There are no manufacturing or other special areas where collective bargaining
 rights are legally or administratively impaired. Barbados has no specially des-
 ignated export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced or compulsory labor is pro-
 hibited by the Constitution and does not exist.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The legal minimum working age
 of 16 in Barbados is generally observed. Minimum age limitations are reinforced by
 compulsory primary and secondary education policies, which require attendance
 until age 16. Occasionally, especially among migrant worker families, children assist
 in agricultural production during the peak season. The Labor Department has a
 small cadre of labor inspectors who conduct spot investigations of enterprises and
 check records to verify compliance with the law. These inspectors are authorized to
 take legal action against an employer who is found to have underage workers.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-Minimum wages for certain specified cat-
 egories of workers are administratively established and enforced by law. The mini-
 mum wage for entry-level commercial workers is marginally sufficient to meet mini-
 mum living standards; most employees earn more. The International Labor Organi-
 zation's (ILO) Committee of Experts (COE) cited Barbados in its 1992 report for not
 adhering to ILO Convention 100 on Equal Remuneration in its wage differentials
 in the sugar industry. The Barbadian Government did not respond, and the COE
 admonished it to ensure the application of the principle of equal remuneration for
 work of equal value to male and female workers in the sugar industry, or to provide
 further information on job descriptions which might justify such wage distinctions.
 The standard legal workweek is 40 hours in 5 days, and the law requires overtime
 payment for hours worked in excess of 40. Workers are guaranteed a minimum of
 3 weeks of annual leave. All workers are covered by unemployment benefits legisla-
 tion and by national insurance (Social Security). A comprehensive government-spon-
 sored health program offers subsidized treatment and medication.
 Under the Factries Act of 1983, which sets out the officially recognized occupa-
 tional safety and health standards, there is effective enforcement of health and safe-
 
 
 335
 ty standards by the Department of Labor, including followup to ensure that prob-
 lems cited are corrected by management.
