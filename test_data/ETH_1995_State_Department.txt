 ETHIOPIA
 Ethiopia's political landscape changed significantly in 1995. In May and June, fol-
 lowing the December 1994 adoption of a new democratic Constitution, Ethiopia held
 national and regional elections. The Transitional Government (TGE), which was es-
 tablished following a long and brutal civil war, handed over power to the elected
 government of the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia (FDRE) in August. Most
 opposition groups chose to boycott the elections, refusing to test the TGE's stated
 willingness to aow opposition participation. Without such participation, candidates
 affiliated with the dominant party within the transitional government, the Ethio-
 pian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF) won a landslide victory in
 national and regional contests. The EPRDF is in turn dominated by the TigrayPeo-
 ple's Liberation Front (TPLF). The ascendance of the EPRDF and a policy of pro-
 moting ethnic federalism, has engendered animosity among some elites who pre-
 viously held centralized power in Ethiopia.
 The Government continued its efforts to devolve authority to regional govern-
 ments but is constrained by underdeveloped local administrative, police, and judicial
 systems. The Government has not yet devised procedures to ensure effective imple-
 mentation of constitutionally guaranteed rights, especially at the regional level. This
 p rocess is complicated by Ethiopia's history, great poverty, and unfamiliarity with
 democratic culture.
 Maintenance of internal security continued to shift from the EPRDF military wing
 to the police. The Ministry of Internal Affairs was abolished in August and the Se-
 curity, Immigration, and Refugees Authority was created. The national police orga-
 nization was subordinated to the Ministry of Justice. Members of the security forces
 committed human rights abuses. Throughout the year the military continued low-
 level operations to counter armed attacks by the Oromo Liberation Front (OLF) and
 the Islamic Front for the Liberation of Oromiya (IFLO) in Region Four. Incidents
 of banditry, some of which may have been politically driven, increased in parts of
 the Southern People's Region and the Oromo and Amhara regions. Bandits were be-
 lieved to be responsible for deaths of civilians and in some cases police in rural
 
 
 87
 areas. The private press and international human rights organizations reported that
 the army, opposition separatists, and Islamic militias all committed human rights
 violations, including extrajudicial killings, in the eastern part of the country. These
 reports diminished sharply following a government-sponsored peace conference at
 Kebre Dehar in January.
 The economy is based on smallholder agriculture, with more than 85 percent of
 the population living in rural areas in very poor conditions. Per capita gross na-
 tional product is estimated at only $110 per year. Coffee accounts for about 60 per-
 cent of export revenue. The Government continued to implement an internationally
 supported economic reform program designed to liberalize the country's economy
 and bring state expenditures into balance.
 The Government continued its stated commitment to human rights but serious
 problems remain. There were credible reports that members of the security forces
 physically abused some criminal suspects and detainees, although these practices do
 not appear widespread. The Government at times harrassed, arrested, and arbitrar-
 ily detained journalists and political activists. The judicial system remains weak,
 understaffed, and at times subject to political influence.
 Culturally based discrimination and violence against women and abuse of children
 continued to be serious problems. Discrimination against the disabled persists. The
 trial of the first group of defendents accused of war crimes under the brutal Marxist
 regime of Colonel Mengistu Haile Mariam (1974-1991), which began in December
 1994, was in recess, at the request of both the defense and the prosecution, for much
 of 1995. At year's end, approximately 1,700 of those accused of war crimes remained
 in detention without charge after more than 3 years. The trials, which are expected
 to last several years, may ultimately involve as many as 3,000 defendants. During
 the year the Government arrested and detained additional individuals for crimes al-
 legedly committed during the "Red Terror" in the late 1970's.
 However, the Government took a number of steps to improve its human rights
 practices. The Government made progress toward its goal of enhancing the quality
 and performance of independent national and regional police forces. The Govern-
 ment also continued to demobilize TPLF soldiers and to move toward the creation
 of a national, apolitical army; as part of this process, members of the military have
 been barred from affiliation with political parties. For the first time7 government
 media published reports of police and other officials who were jailed or dismissed
 for abuse of authority and violations of human rights. Several hundred prisoners
 were released from overcrowded jails in the Southern region following a review of
 their cases by regional prosecutors. Prior to the May elections, the Government im-
 proved access to the official media for opposition political groups. Nevertheless, seri-
 ous limitations on the media remain, particularly criminal penalties based on the
 1992 Press Law.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-The Government continues to face
 low-level armed insurgency and banditry in various parts of the country, and both
 the military and the insurgents committed serious abuses, including extrajudicial
 killings.
 There  were   numerous unconfirmed    reports that both   government and
 antigovermment forces committed summary executions during clashes in parts of
 Oromiya and the eastern Somali region, which includes the Ogaden. Groups alleg-
 edly involved in these incidents include the army, the Ogaden National Liberation
 Front (ONLF), the Islamic fundamentalist group Al-Ittihad Al-Islami, the OLF, and
 the IFLO. The level of violence in the Somali region diminished sharply following
 a government sponsored peace conference there in January.
 Banditry remained a serious problem, especially in parts of the Southern People's
 Region, Oromiya, and Amhara. Bandits killed numerous civilians, police, and
 EPRDF soldiers during robbery attempts. While government critics frequently as-
 cribe political motives to bandit activity, most evidence suggests that these activities
 were economically motivated. In combating banditry, credible reports indicate that
 government troops sometimes used excessive force. Local security campaigns against
 suspected criminals sometimes resulted in suspicious deaths. However, bandits are
 often armed with automatic weapons and hand grenades. In January bandits or op-
 ponents of the Government killed a United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees
 (UNHCR) relief worker in Moyale.
 In one attack that may have been politically motivated, in April an opposition
 candidate from Bale was killed. The Government took no action to investigate the
 
 
 88
 1994 assassination of the Deputy Mayor of Code or the July 1994 death of
 Alebatchew Goji who died while in police custody.
 Land mines laid by suspected Islamic separatists were responsible for the deaths
 and injuries of several relief workers in the Somali Region early in the year.
 b. Disappearance.-There continued to be numerous unconfirmed reports of al-
 leged disappearances. Human rights groups continued to charge that the where-
 abouts of dozens of people arrested when the Government took power in 1991 re-
 mained unknown. In response, the Government claimed that some of the alleged
 missing were among the estimated 1,700 persons in detention awaiting trial for
 crimes committed against the civilian population during the Mengistu regime.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The new Constitution prohibits the use of torture and mistreatment of prisoners.
 Nevertheless, there were credible reports that security officials sometimes beat or
 mistreat detainees. Government media published numerous reports of police and
 other officials who were jailed or dismissed for abuse of authority and violations of
 human rights. In March several South Omo Zone officials were dismissed for taking
 bribes and beating people. In August 40 policemen were dismissed in Arsi Zone for,
 amongother things, "infringing upon human rights." In September 10 policemen
 were ismissed in the central zone of Tigray for "bribery and beating innocent civil-
 ians." During the fall, hundreds of other administrative and police officials were
 sanctioned or dismissed for unspecified abuses of authority, some of which may have
 involved human rights abuses. There were no substantiated reports of instances of
 torture against prisoners.
 There were credible reports that EPRDF officials sometimes use unmarked houses
 and military camps for the temporary detention and interrogation of OLF support-
 ers and other suspected political opponents.
 Prison conditions are acceptable and are not generally life threatening. However,
 despite actions by prosecutors in some regions to release some detainees, overcrowd-
 ing remains a serious problem Health officials note that overcrowding has resulted
 in increased incidence of tuberculosis, malaria, typhoid fever and other serious dis-
 eases within the prison population. Prisoners are often allocated less than 2 square
 meters of sleeping space in a room which may contain from 8 to 200 people. Prison
 food is adequate. Prisoners are typically permitted daily access to prisonyards. Visi-
 tors are aliowed and many prisoners receive regular deliveries of food and other
 supplies from family members. Female prisoners are kept separately from men, and
 rape does not appear to be a problem.
 The Government permits independent monitoring of prison conditions, military
 camps and police stations by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC)
 and often by diplomatic missions. However, the ICRC does not have immediate ac-
 cess to government facilities and must either request permission or notify each time
 it wants to visit. Permission to visit detention facilities is routinely granted, al-
 though the ICRC must obtain additional clearances from officials in each of Ethio-
 pia's 10 regions. Diplomats who visited with imprisoned All Amhara People's Orga-
 nization (AAPO) Chairman Asrat Woldeyes in September found him to be in good
 health, with no complaints of physical mistreatment. He is allowed visitors and re-
 ceives food daily from family members (see Section I.e.). In September all regional
 police chiefs and senior prisons officials attended a seminar at which the subject of
 prisoners' rights were a main topic. National police officials stressed the responsibil-
 ity of local authorities to guarantee the basic human rights of prisoners. Federal
 prosecutors are being assigned to the regions to oversee compliance.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution, and both the Criminal
 and Civil Codes prohibit arbitrary arrest and detention, but the Government did not
 always respect these rights in practice.
 Under the Criminal Procedure Code, any person detained must be charged and
 informed of the charges within 48 hours and, in most cases, be offered release on
 bail. Those persons believed to have committed capital offenses, such as murder and
 treason, may be detained for 4 weeks while police conduct an investigation, and for
 additional 15-day periods while the investigation is being conducted. Some serious
 offenses are not bailable. In practice, people are often detained without a warrant,
 frequently not charged within 48 hours, and if released on bail, never recalled to
 court. Lack of judicial capacity contributes to many of these irregularities.
 Throughout 1995 the Government continued to arrest and detain persons without
 charge. In typical cases, security forces arrested and held these persons incommuni-
 cado for several days or weeks before eventually releasing them. Several hundred
 Oromo youth, suspected of participation in the OLF armed campaign against the
 Government, were detained in this manner. In the town of Nekempt, Olana Beti,
 an OLF member, claims to have been detained 6 times without charge over the past
 3 years.
 
 
 89
 Although most often government security officers detained people for short periods
 only, thousands of criminal suspects remained in detention without charge or trial
 at year's end. Many of these cases result from a severe shortage of judges, prosecu-
 tors, attorneys, clerks, and courthouses. The Southern Regional Supreme Court, for
 example, has only 4 judges out of an authorized complement of 15. Similar problems
 exist, to varying degrees, in other regions. At year's end, courts in the Southern Re-
 gion had a back log of several thousand cases, some dating back several years. The
 Government began to address these problems by creating special judicial teams to
 reduce backlogs in key areas. These efforts resulted in the release of hundreds of
 detainees in the Oromo Region. Prosecutors also released hundreds of detainees in
 the Southern People's Region often for lack of evidence. Among these were leaders
 of the Sidamo Liberation Movement (SLM). The SLM has been known to advocate
 and engage in violence against the Government in the past. Two judges who had
 been illegally detained in 1994 in Jiuka for issuing an unpopular decision were re-
 leased in March following a visit by Western ambassadors (see Section i.e.).
 In late June and early July, over 300 people, including journalists and business-
 men, were arrested in connection with the investigation of the assassination at-
 tempt against President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt. Four of the journalists were held
 for over a month in connection with stories which criticized the Government's role
 in the incident and its aftermath. The journalists were all eventually released on
 bail. For more than 3 months, Bekele Eshete and more than 60 of his associates
 in the tourist industry were jailed without charge before finally being released in
 mid-September. Several individuals accused of helping the terrorists obtain forged
 Ethiopian documents remain detained. Following the closure of several large deten-
 tion facilities in 1994, 280 detainees were formally charged, their trials began in
 early 1995. In December 168 defendants were released, and trials of the remaining
 93 were continuing. Two Ethiopian National Democratic Party (ENDP) members
 who remained in detention at the end of 1994 were released in 1995. The Govern-
 ment continued to hold 30 Muslim activists believed to be members of an extremist
 movement (see Section 2.c.).
 Coalition of Ethiopian Democratic Forces (COEDF) member Abera Yemane-Ab,
 arrested in 1993 when he returned to Ethiopia for an opposition sponsored "peace
 and reconciliation conference," remains jailed by order of the Special Prosecutor's
 Office (SPO) without charge. he is suspected of crimes against humanity committed
 during the "Red Terror." A diplomatic visit in September revealed him to be in good
 health with access to medical care and visitors. Southern Coalition Executive Com-
 mittee member Mekonnen Dori was arrested by order of the SPO in August. Al-
 though not yet charged, SPO officials indicate that new evidence implicates
 Mekonnen in crimes a legedly committed while he was a provincial official in the
 Guraghe Region in the 1970's.
 Exile is illegal and not used as a means of political control. In 1994, at the behest
 of the Eritrean Government, Ethiopia arrested 26 members of the Eritrean Libera-
 tion Front-Revolutionary Command (ELF-RC) for alleged acts of opposition to the
 Eritrean Government. The Government has allowed them to seek asylum in other
 countries or remain in exile in Ethiopia rather than be deported to Eritrea where
 they would likely face harsh measures. Two countries agreed to accept the 26 as
 refugees or immigrants, and they departed Ethiopia at the end of theyear.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution provides for an independentAjudi-
 ciary, and the central courts continued to show signs of judicial independence. How-
 ever, local judges have complained about harassment and intimidation by local offi-
 cials: Some judges complain that they are subject to political pressure and believe
 they must treat EPRD F defendants leniently. Anecdotal evidence suggest that the
 reverse is true for cases involving members of the opposition.
 The FDRE continues to restructure the judiciary toward a decentralized federal
 system, comprised of courts at the district (woreda) and regional levels. The Central
 (federal) igh Court and Central Supreme Court adjudicate cases involving federal
 law, transregional issues, and national security and hear both original and appeal
 cases.
 The Government's goal is a decentralized system that brings justice closer to the
 people, but the reality is that the severe shortage of adequately trained personnel
 in many regions and serious financial constraints, combine to keep the judiciary
 weak and oveiburdened, and to deny most citizens the full protections provided for
 in the Constitution. The Government has established regional offices of the Ministry
 of Justice to monitor local judicial developments in an effort to help ensure effective
 implementation of constitutional rights at the local level.
 Until regional legislatures are fully established and begin to pass laws particular
 to their region, the Criminal Code will remain the same at both the regional and
 federal levels. Trials are public, and defendants have the right to a defense attorney.
 
 
 The Government established a public defender's office to provide legal counsel to in-
 digent defendants although its scope remains severely limited. Court appointed at-
 torneys represent many of the initial group of defendants in the war crimes trials,
 following claims that they ould not afford adequate defense. The law does not allow
 the defense access to prosecutorial evidence before the trial.
 Shari'a (Islamic) courts hear religious and family cases involving Muslims. The
 new Constitution authorizes the existing Shari'a courts and gives the legislature of
 any jurisdiction the authority to empower future Shari'a courts. Under the Constitu-
 tion, both parties must agree to be bound to Shari'a law for it to be applied. In addi-
 tion, some traditional courts still function and, though not sanctioned by law, re-
 solve legal disputes for the majority of Ethiopians who live in rural areas and gen-
 erally have little access to modern judicial facilities.
 The impact of the regional Judicial Administrative Commissions, (JAC's) estab-
 lished by the Government in 1993 to help select and discipline judges remained lim-
 ited. In some instances, zonal officials have dismissed or transferred local judges for
 falling to follow their instructions. Two judges who had been detained illegally in
 1994 in Jinka for issuing an unpopular decision were released and reinstated in
 March following 7 months in detention. Prior release orders issued by the Southern
 Region JAC had been ignored by local Jinka officials.
 The trials of the first group of 73 defendants charged with committing crimes
 against humanity during the "Red Terror" and the campaign of forced resettlement
 and villagization during the Mengistu regime from 1974 to 1991 began in December
 1994. After a 3-months continuance, the trials resumed briefly in March. They were
 then adjourned a second time until after national elections in May and the annual
 judicial recess, which lasts during the rainy season from June until September. The
 trials resumed for 1 day on November 28, 1995, and were adjourned until February
 13, 1996. The continuance was requested by both the prosecution and the defense
 in order to have time to prepare their cases. Of this first group of 73, the Govern-
 ment is trying 21 in absentia, including Colonel Mengistu Haile Mariam, the former
 president, who is now in self-exile in Zimbabwe. In September Chief Special Pros-
 ecutor and Head of the Special Prosecutor's Office (SPO) Girma Wakjira, stated that
 investigations involving the remaining 1,500 detainees, as well as some persons pre-
 viously released on bail, would be completed by the end of December, at which time
 they would all be charged or have their cases dismissed. This deadline, like previous
 "deadlines" in 1994 and July 1995, was not met. The SPO was established in 1992
 to create an historical record of the abuses during the Mengistu government and
 to bring to justice those criminally responsible for human rights violations. The Gov-
 ernment may eventually charge and try more than 3,000 defendants. Local court ob-
 servers believe that the trials themselves may last 3 to 5 years.
 Professor Asrat Woldeyes, chairman of the AAPO and four other AAPO leaders
 were convicted in 1994 for involvement in a 1993 meeting in which plans for armed
 activities against the Transitional Government were allegedly made. Asrat was also
 convicted of "incitement to war" in connection with a speech he made in 1992. He
 was sentenced to a total of 5 years inprisn. He currently faces charges stemming
 from a May 1994 jailbreak in Debre Berhan in which several guards were killed.
 His trial on those charges was set to begin in late 1995. Several hundred AAPO sup-
 porters who were detained and subjected to mistreatment in September 1994 in con-
 nection with an unlicensel demonstration at the High Court in Addis Ababa, were
 never charged; they were released and never recalled to court.
 Opposition groups allege that some of the 1,700 persons detained by the SPO, as
 well as some other detainees, are political prisoners (see Section 1.d.). The Govern-
 ment denies that it holds political prisoners; most of the detainees have never been
 brought to trial.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The law
 requires judicial search warrants, but in practice they are seldom obtained outside
 of Addis Ababa. The Government continued a nationwide campaign to uncover and
 confiscate  unregistered  firearms.  Government  security  officials  conducted
 warrantless seaes of private and commercial vehicles as well as private homes.
 Some leaders and supporters of opposition groups allege that they are under surveil-
 lance for expressing antigoverment views. For example, AAPO supporters in the
 Debre Berhan area complain of being watched and occasionally brought into neigh-
 borhood government offices for questioning about their activities.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-While the Constitution and the 1992 Press Law
 provide for the right to free speech and press, the Government often restricted both
 of these freedoms in practice.
 
 
 The Press Law is vague and many journalists complain that it can be interpreted
 broadly to target journalists that the Government dislikes. Many journalists fall vic-
 tim to provisions of the Press Law concerning publishing false information or incite-
 ment of ethnic hatred. For example, government security forces arrested 10 journal-
 ists in June and a dozen editors and publishers in November. Many of the detained
 journalists were arrested for publishing stories about the Government's investiga-
 tion of the attempted assassination of Egyptian President Mubarak or about the as-
 sassination attempt on former DERG lea-der, Mengistu Hale Mariam.
 Bail for journalists is sometimes set at unreasonably high levels, often much more
 than their annual salary. At the end of 1995, 4 journalists were serving sentences
 of from 1 to 2  years, and 11 journalists remained in detention without charge. At
 the end of the year, four journalists were out on bail. Despite the threat of legal
 action, however, the press continued to publish antigoverninent articles without any
 immediate sanction.
 The Government continued to denyprivate journalists access to government press
 conferences, calling into question the Goveent's affirmations of support for a free
 press. Moreover, virtually all government officials refuse to speak to the private
 press even to confirm or deny an allegation. However, much of the private press con-
 tinues to lack professionalism in its reporting. To address this issue the Government
 is developing a training center for journalists. Toward the end of the year, the Gov-
 ernment also took several important steps to open a constructive dialog with ele-
 ments of the private press.
 Ethiopians are generally free to discuss publicly any topic they choose, but those
 expressing controversial views were vulnerable, if not always subjected to, govern-
 ment harassment. For example, in March police arrested and detained briefly a
 Muslim youth for a speech on Isam as a legal system. These problems appar more
 common in rural areas where most Ethiopians live. Opposition parties and human
 rights organizations were able to hold press conferences and public meetings with-
 out apparent retribution.
 It is estimated that only about 1 percent of citizens have regular access to any
 newspaper and magazine, and citizens outside Addis Ababa have extremely limited
 access to the print media. As a result of oor management, market forces, and gov-
 ernment harassment, less than 20 biweekly and weekly papers have published more
 than a year.
 Foreign journalists continued to operate freely often writing articles critical of
 government policies. They or their local stringers often were granted greater access
 to government officials than were local journalists.
 The Government controls radio, the most influential medium in reaching rural
 populations, and the sole television station. Government policies and views domi-
 nate their programming. The Government made efforts to open the official media
 to opposition political views prior to the May elections, and some opposition can-
 didates and parties took advantage of these opportunities. The Government does not
 currently allow private satellite receiving dishes.
 In August, following the Ministry of Information's merger with the Ministry of
 Culture, the Government announced that the official press would be "autonomous
 from the new Ministry. The Government established a task force to work on a na-
 tional information policy. Government media reporters practice self-censorship; but
 covered both government and opposition candidates during the election. The official
 media attempted to make space and broadcast time available and even proposed
 working with the candidates through the National Election Board (NEB), to improve
 their broadcast presentations.
 The Government restricts academic freedom. Students at Addis Ababa University
 are not allowed to engage in political activity or associations on campus, and faculty
 members remain cautious about political involvement in the wake of the 1993 dis-
 missal of 41 faculty members. In 1995 the teachers won a lawsuit against the uni-
 versity for procedural irregularities associated with their summary dismissal. The
 court granted 9-months' back pay but found that it did not have jurisdiction to con-
 sider their request for reinstatement. As a result of a nonviolent student demonstra-
 tion in December, the Government encouraged students to set up a representative
 committee to articulate their grievances on living conditions and academic quality.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 the right of peaceful assembly, freedom of association, and the right to engage in
 unrestricted peaceful political activity. However, the Government has used legal in-
 strnments to restrict these rights. rganizers of political meetings or demonstra-
 tions must notify the Government in advance and obtain a permit.
 In mid-Augnst the Relief and Rehabilitation Commission (RRC) announced the
 revocation of registration certificates for some 47 indigenous and international non-
 governmental organizations (NGO's) for failure to adhere to terms of their registra-
 
 
 92
 tion agreements. However, with the installation of the new Government the proce-
 dures for registration were changed, and primary responsibility for registration of
 NGO's was shifted to the Ministry of Justice (MOJ). As of late 1995, the MOJ had
 yet to finalize procedures for NGO registration. The Ethiopian Human Rights Coun-
 cil (EHRCO), which the Government and many observers believe to be primarily a
 political organization, has been denied registration as an NGO for the past 3 years.
 The Government requires political parties to register with the NEB. Parties that
 do not participate in two consecutive national elections are subject to deregistration.
 As of mid-1995, there were 60 organized political parties, 44 of which had received
 registration certificates from the NEB. Of these, 53 are regional parties, and 7 are
 national. Several opposition groups complained of NEB procedural irregularities
 which served to limit party registration with the NEB prior to the May elections.
 In at least one case, however, the Government ignored vocal objections by one of
 its affiliated parties and permitted a key opposition group to contest the elections
 even though that group was not formally registered with the NEB.
 Credible reports from some regions indicated that local officials sometimes har-
 assed and restricted the activities of opposition political activists. For example, 12
 members of the Omo People's Democratic Union were detained for 10 months in
 Jinka on questionable evidence in a move widely believed to preclude their partici-
 pation in regional elections. Similarly, credible reports indicate that ethnic Nuer
 candidates of the Gambela People's Democratic Unity Party (GPDUP) were denied
 registration in Gambela.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of religion, includ-
 ingthe right of conversion, and freedom of worship exists in practice.
 On February 21, a violent riot broke out at the Grand Anwar Mosque in Addis
 Ababa leaving 9 people dead and dozens injured. The incident was apparently
 caused by a rift in the Supreme Islamic Council over the leadership of the Council
 and the planning for the upcoming Id Al Fetir holiday marking the end of Ramadan.
 Police response to the riot was remarkably measured, largely relying on the use of
 crowd control techniques instead of gunfire. The Government responded by briefly
 closing all the mosques in the city and arresting more than 2,000 people, among
 them 30 Muslim religious leaders. The mosques were reopened after 2 days in time
 for Id Al Fetir, and over 90 percent of those initially arrested were released by that
 time. At the end of the year, the Government continued to hold, but has not
 charged, about 30 Muslim activists believed to be members of an extremist "jihad"
 movement.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-Freedom of movement, including the right of domestic and foreign trav-
 el, emigration, and repatriation, is provided under the Constitution. Citizens may
 freely change their residence or workplace. Citizens and residents of Ethiopia are
 required to obtain an exit visa before departing the country; exit visas are issued
 routinely, except for persons with pending court cases or debts.
 All Ethiopian Jews (Falashas, Beta Israel) who wanted to leave Ethiopia for Israel
 are believed to have departed. The status of the estimated several thousand Feles
 Mora (Ethiopians who claim forced conversation to Christianity from Judaism in the
 past hundred years but have not been accepted as Jews by the Israeli Rabbinate)
 remains unresolved. Israel is handling Feles Mora applications on a case by case
 basis, and the two Governments have agreed to grant aout 100 visas a month for
 family reunification.
 According to the UNHCR and to foreign diplomats, the Government treats asylum
 seekers fairly and is cooperative on issues concerning the repatriation of Ethiopian
 refugees.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 This right was exercised for the first time in Ethiopian history in May. However,
 most opposition groups chose to boycott the elections, despite a widespread finding
 that opposition participation was possible. Boycotting parties claimed that the Gov-
 ernment impeded their ability to participate in the political process. Concerted ef-
 forts by Western governments to promote dialog and political reconciliation between
 the Government and several key opposition groups through the spring were not suc-
 cessful. Nevertheless, observers organized by Western donor governments, the Orga-
 nization of African Unity (OAU), and a coalition of indigenous NGO's judged the
 elections to be generally free and fair, though numerous irregularities were cited.
 As a result of the boycott by some opposition parties, the election was largely non-
 competitive, ensuring an overwhelming victory by candidates of the better funded
 andbetter organized EPRDF over candidates of the relatively weak and poorly orga-
 nized opposition parties and independent candidates. The Government of the Fed-
 
 
 93
 eral Democratic Republic of Ethiopia officially took power in late August. Prime
 Minister Meles Zenawi leads the new Government, as he did as President of the
 TGE.
 The opposition Ethiopian National Democratic Party (ENDP) fielded 85 can-
 didates nationwide, one of whom, Yusef Ahmed Siraj, was elected from Dessie.
 Leading up to the election, there were credible reports of EPRDF harassment of
 some opposition party members and independent candidates, especially outside
 Addis Ababa. ENDP candidates who were campaigning in the Awassa and Dilla
 areas were reportedly stoned and assaulted by people believed to represent local au-
 thorities. The Government and the NEB made credible attempts to investigate
 abuses when informed of their occurrence. Serious attempts were also made to pro-
 vide registered candidates access to official media.
 Political participation remains closed to a number of organizations which have not
 renounced violence and do not accept the FDRE as a legitimate authority. These
 groups include Medhin, the Coalition of Ethiopian Democratic Forces, the Ethiopian
 People's Revolutionary Party, the Oromo Liberation Front, and several smaller So-
 mah groups.
 Neither law nor practice restrict the participation of women or minorities in poli-
 tics. Although by historical standards women s status and political participation is
 greater than ever before, women are underrepresented in the FDRE Council of Min-
 isters and among the leadership of all political organizations. Only 1 of the 15 mem-
 bers of the FDRE Council of Ministers is a woman; 1 other woman holds ministerial
 rank, and a number of others hold positions among the senior ranks of government.
 Only I of 30 judges on the Central High Court is a woman.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The Ethiopian Human Rights Council, Ethiopia's only self-proclaimed human
 rights monitoring organization, continues to operate without legal status as an NGO
 because the Government and other observers consider it a political organization.
 Other human rights organizations include the EthiopianHuman Rights and Peace
 Center, affiliated with the law faculty at Addis Ababa University, the Ethiopian
 Congress for Democracy, Action Professionals Association for the People, the Ethio-
 pian Women Lawyers Association, and the Inter-Africa Group. These groups are pri-
 marily engaged in civic and human rights education, legal assistance, and trial mon-
 itoring.
 The FDRE allows visits by the ICRC and international human rights groups and
 permits them to operate and travel freely, although prior approval is required for
 prison visits. International human rights groups and foreign diplomats have been
 encouraged to observe the war crimes trials which began in December 1994. A rep-
 resentative from Human Rights Watch/Africa Watch spent 20 days in Ethiopia in
 May and June to examine the issues surrounding the SPO trials. The Government
 has been slow to investigate and address specific human rights concerns, although
 security authority officials have generally been responsive to requests for informa-
 tion. However, the Government and some prominent international human rights
 monitoring organizations, such as Amnesty International, have failed completely to
 achieve a constructive dialog, which has undermined the ability of such groups to
 verify allegations and compile an accurate picture of Ethiopia's current human
 rights environment.
 In June two representatives of the International Commission of Jurists (ICJ) were
 turned back upon arrival at Bole International Airport. Immigration officers noted
 that neither had an entry visa, both were carrying multiple passports, and at least
 one had a name which appeared on the Government's watch list as a suspected nar-
 cotics trafficker. The ICJ officials claimed that they were invited guests of the OAU
 and that airport visas had been arranged by the OAU. The OAU's Office of Protocol
 stated that in fact no airport visas had been arranged and that participants to the
 OAU summit had been advised to obtain Ethiopian visas prior to travel.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution states that all persons are equal before the law. The law pro-
 vides that all persons should have equal and effective protection without discrimina-
 tion on grounds of race, color, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, na-
 tional or social origin, wealth, birth, or other status. The new Government, however,
 has not yet put fully into place mechanisms for effective enforcement of these pro-
 tections.
 Women.-The Constitution provides for the equality of women under the law, but
 practical application of these provisions has not taken place. Domestic violence, in-
 
 
 cluding wife beating and rape, is a pervasive social problem. While women theoreti-
 cally have recourse to the police and the courts, societal norms inhibit many women
 from seeking legal redress, especially women living in remote areas. There is spo-
 radic media coverage of domestic abuse cases, although the press rarely covers in-
 stances of rape because of the stigma attached to the crime. There were disturbing
 reports that some husbands force their wives into prostitution to supplement family
 income.
 Although women played a prominent role (including service in combat) during the
 civil war and hold some senior government positions, in practice women do not enjoy
 equal status with men. The law holds men and women to be equal, but tradition
 and cultural factors place the man as head of the household, and, in practice, men
 typically hold land tenure and property rights for the whole family. Discrimination
 is most acute in the rural areas, where 85 percent of the population lives, and where
 women work over 13 hours a day fulfilling household and farming responsibilities.
 In urban areas, women have fewer employment opportunities than men, and the
 jobs available do not provide equal pay for equal work. In 1993 the TGE launched
 an initiative to promote the equality of women by changing statutes, by including
 women's concerns in the Government's development planning, and by establishing
 women's affairs desks in each of the ministries.
 Children.-The Government has not given children's issues a high priority, but
 has encouraged the efforts of domestic and international NGO's, such as Save the
 Children, which focus on children's social and health issues.
 Societal abuse against young girls continues to be a serious problem. Almost all
 girls undergo some form of female genital mutilation (FGM), which is widely con-
 demned by international health experts as damaging to both physical and psycho-
 logical health. Clitorectomies are typically performed 7 days after birth, and the ex-
 cision of the labia and infibulation, the most extreme and dangerous form of FGM,
 can occur any time between the age of 8 and the onset of puberty. FGM is not illegal
 in Ethiopia, although it is officially discouraged, and the Government has been very
 supportive of the National Committee on Traditional Prctices in Ethiopia which is
 dedicated to eradicating FGM. Early childhood marriage is prevalent in rural areas
 with girls as young as age 9 being party to arranged marriages. Ethiopia has an
 extremely high maternal mortality rate, partially due to food taboos for pregnant
 women, early marriage, and birth complications related to FGM, especially from
 infibulation.
 There is an ever increasing number of street children in Addis Ababa. Either or-
 phaned or homeless, these children beg, sometimes as part of a "gang," in order to
 survive. Government run orphanages are unable to handle the number of street
 children and younger children are often abused by older children. There are credible
 reports of children being malmed or blinded by their "handlers" in order to raise
 their earnings from begging. Abandoned infants are often overlooked or neglected
 at hospitals and orphanages, and those children found to be H1V positive are taken
 to an Adds Ababa orphanage where very limited medical care is available.
 People With Disabilities.-There is no legally sanctioned discrimination against
 people with disabilities in Ethiopia. The Constitution stipulates that the State shall
 allocate resources to provide rehabilitation and assistance to the physically and
 mentally disabled. Cultural attitudes toward the disabled are often negative, and
 even people with minor disabilities complain of rampant job discrimination. The
 Government does not mandate access to buildings or government services for per-
 sons with disabilities. In 1994 the Council of Representatives passed a law mandat-
 ing equal rights for the disabled, but the Government has not yet put into place
 mechanisms to enforce this law. An official at the Rehabilitation Agency estimated
 that, partly as a result of the long civil war, there are more than 5 million disabled
 people in Ethiopia out of a population of roughly 55 million.
 National /RaciallEthnic Minorities.-Ethiopia has more than 80 different ethnic
 groups. Although all of these groups have had some influence on the political and
 cultural life of the country, Amharas and Tigrayans from the northern highlands
 have traditionally dominated. Some ethnic groups, such as Oromos, the largest sin-
 gle group, clm to have been dominated for a least a century by the Amoharas and
 igayans. In an attempt to rectify this problem, the Government has supported the
 establishment of a federal system and in 1992 changed regional boundaries to en-
 compass entire (major) ethnic populations more completely. In some areas, ethnic
 languages, such as Oromiffa, are now being taught in local primary schools instead
 of Amharic. There is some evidence of discrimination in employment based on lin-
 guistic ability.
 
 
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Only a small percentage of the population is in-
 volved in wage labor employment, which is largely concentrated in the capital and
 other cities and towns. Approximately 85 percent of the work force lives in the coun-
 tryside, engaged in subsistence farming.
 The Constitution and the 1993 Labor Law provide most workers with the right
 to form and join unions and engage in collective bargaining, but only about 250,000
 workers are unionized. Employees of the Civil and Security Services (where most
 wage earners are found), judges, and prosecutors are not allowed to form unions.
 Workers who provide an "essential service" are not allowed to strike. Essential serv-
 ices include a large number of categories such as air transport, railways, bus serv-
 ices, police and fire services, post and telecommunications, lbanks, and pharmacies.
 Unions are not affiliated with the Government or political parties. There is no
 legal requirement for unions to belong to the Confederation of Ethiopian Trade
 Unions (CETUJ), which was established in 1993. CETU includes nine federations or-
 ganized by industrial and service sector rather than by region. In December 1994,
 the Government decertilied CETU following a 30-day probationary period *iven to
 permit CETU to resolve internal disputes. In 1995 CEU offices remained closed
 despite a court ruling that the CETU closing was improper. The law stipulates that
 a trade organization may not act in an overtly political manner.
 The 1993 Labor Law explicitly gives workers the right to strike to protect their
 interests, but it also sets forth many restrive procedures which apply before a legal
 strike may take place. These apply equally to an employer's right to lock out work-
 ers. Strikes must be supported by a majority of the workers affected by the decision.
 The Labor Law prohibits retribution against strikers. Both sides must make efforts
 at conciliation, provide at least 10-days' notice to the Government and include the
 reasons for the action, and, in cases alrad beore a court or labor board, the party
 must provide at least a 30-day warning.
 If an agreement between unions and management cannot be reached, the Minister
 of Labor may refer the case to arbitration by a Labor Relations Board (LRB). The
 FDRE has established LRB's at the national level and in some regions. The Minister
 of Labor and Social Affairs appoints each LUB chalrman, and the four board mem-
 bers are composed of two each from trade unions and employer associations. It is
 unlawful to strike against an order from an LRB.
 There were no strikes organized by unions during the year.
 Independent unions and those belonging to CETU are free to affiliate with and
 participate in international labor bodies.
 b.The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Collective bargaining is pro-
 tected under the Labor Law and under the Constitution, and it is practiced freely
 throughout the country. Collective bargaining agreements concluded between 1975
 and the promulgation of the January 1993 Labor Law are covered under the 1975
 Labor Code and remain in force. Labor experts estimate that more than 90 percent
 of unionized workers are covered by collective bargaining agreements. Wages are ne-
 gotiated at the plant level. The law prohibits antinion discrimination by employers
 against union members and organizers. Grievanceprocedures are in place to hear
 allegations of discrimination brought by individuals or unions. Employers found
 guilty of antinion discrimination are required to reinstate workers fired for union
 activities.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Constitution proscribes slav-
 ery, which was officially abolished in 1942, and involuntary servitude. The Criminal
 Code specifically prohibits forced labor unless by court order as a punitive measure.
 Forced or compulsory labor is virtually nonexistent.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-Under the 1993 Labor Law, the
 minimum age for wage or salary employment is 14 years. Children between the ages
 of 14 to 18 are covered by special provisions in the Labor Law. Children may not
 work more than 7 hours per day, work between the hours of 10 p.m. and 6 n.m.,
 work on pubc holi hdays or rest days, or perform overtime. While some efforts to en-
 force these regulations are made within the formal industrial sector, large numbers
 of children of all ages work outside of most government regulatory control on farms
 in the countryside and as street peddlers in the cities.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-There is no minimum wage in the private sec-
 tr. However, since 1985 a minimum wage has been set and paid to public sector
 employees who are by far the largest group of wage earners. This public sector mini-
 mum wage is $16.80 (105 et birr) per month, which is insufficient to provide a de-
 cent standard of livin for a worker and family. According to the Office of the Study
 of Wages and Other Rtemunerations, a famly of five requires a monthly income of
 
 
 $62.40 (390 et birr), thus even with two minimum wage earners a family receives
 only about half the income needed for healthful subsistence.
 The legal workweek, as stipulated in the 1993 Labor Law, is 48 hours, 6 days of
 8 hours each, with a 24-hour rest period. However, in practice, most employees work
 a 40-hour workweek, 5 days of 8 hours each.
 The FDRE, private industry, and unions negotiate to set occupational health and
 safety standards. However, the Inspection Department of the Ministry of Labor and
 Social Affairs enforces these standards ineffectively, due to a lack of human and fi-
 nancial resources. Workers have the right to remove themselves from dangerous sit-
 uations without jeopardy to continued employment.
