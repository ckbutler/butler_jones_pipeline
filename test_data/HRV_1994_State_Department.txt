 CROATIA
 Three years after the Republic of Croatia declared independence, one-quarter of
 its land continued to be occupied by rebel Serbs. No progress was made in 1994 in
 implementing the Vance Peace Plan, and the United Nations Protective Force
 (UNPROFOR) continued its peacekeeping activities in four U.N. protected areas
 (UNPA's). A March cease-fire created a 2-kilometer-wide zone of separation and led
 to a dramatic decrease in violence. In December the Government and the rebel
 Serbs agreed upon a package of economic and confidence-building measures, the im-
 plementation of which began with the opening of the Zagreb-Belgrade highway to
 civilian traffic on December 21.
 Croatia is a constitutional parliamentary democracy with a powerful presidency.
 President Franjo Tudiman, elected in 1992, serves as Head of State and commander
 in chief of the armed forces, chairs the influential National Defense and Security
 Council, and appoints the Prime Minister, who leads the Government. President
 Tudjman's party, the Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ), holds the majority of seats
 in both houses of Parliament. Government influence weakens the nominally inde-
 pendent judiciary. The enormous constitutional powers of the presidency, the mili-
 tary occupation of large sections of the country, and the overwhelming dominance
 of one political party tend to stifle the expression of diverse views.
 
 
 The Ministry of Defense oversees the military, while the Ministry of the Interior
 oversees the police. Both police and military personnel were responsible for abuses,
 including physical abuse of prisoners and detainees.
 In the Serb-controlled UNPA's, the well-armed police and military forces of the
 self-proclaimed "Republic of Serbian Krajina ("RSK") continued their pattern of
 egregious human rights abuses against both Serbs and non-Serbs, including phys-
 ical violence and "ethnic cleansing.3 Of the 44,000 Croats who before the conflict
 lived in what is now UNPA Sector South, only 800 to 900 remain. In Sector North,
 only 1,000 Croats of an original population of 112,000 remain.
 Croatia has a mixed economy in which industry is largely state owned, and agri-
 culture is mostly in private hands. The Government's stabilization program, intro-
 duced in 1993, continued to keep inflation low, but little progress was made on ei-
 ther privatization or free market reforms. The continuing division of the country,
 the massive refugee problem, and the threat of renewed war all limited economic
 recovery.
 While the use of violence by security forces against Serbs in government-con-
 trolled areas declined, cases of disappearance and harassment continued near the
 frontline areas. Ethnic Serbs continued to suffer from ever-present, subtle, and
 sometimes open discrimination in such areas as the administration of justice, em-
 ployment, housing, and the free exercise of their cultural rights. In fewer numbers
 than in previous years, Serb were also victims of anonymous threats, vandalism,
 and-more rarely-physical attacks. Many Serbs left Croatia during the year as a
 result of the combined economic discrimination and physical threats, although the
 total number was impossible to determine. The Government made only token efforts
 to arrest and prosecute the perpetrators of the more egregious abuses committed in
 1992 and 1993 and continued to discriminate against non-Croats in the granting of
 citizenship. Early in the year, the Government also discriminated against Muslim
 refugees from Bosnia, using arbitrary detention and forced repatriation.
 In the Serb-controlled portions of the UNPA's, there was no improvement in the
 human rights situation. The police and military forces of the "RSK' continued to use
 violence, intimidation, harassment, and displacement against nonethnic Serbs to
 achieve the goal of ethnic cleansing. All residents were subjected to a totally con-
 trolled legal system operating in an atmosphere without any of the basic human
 rights of freedom of expression, assembly, press, religion, movement, or the right to
 change their government.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no substantiated reports
 of politically motivated or other extrajudicial killings in government-controlled parts
 of Croatia. However, opposition and human rights groups criticized the failure of
 Croatian authorities to bring to justice the parties responsible for several cases from
 previous years, particularly those of Serbs killed in 1991 and 1992. Those allegedly
 implicated in the killings include personnel in the Defense and Interior Ministries,
 but the Government insisted the charges were baseless.
 Reports of political killings in the Serb-occupied UNPA's also decreased, although
 a disproportionate number of homicide victims in the "RSIK" were non-Serbs. More
 than one-third of the reported 68 homicide victims in the Serb-controlled UNPA's
 were non-Serbs, according to local (Serbian) police. Out of an estimated remaining
 Croatian population in Serb-controlled territory of perhaps 4,000, 16 ethnic Croats
 (or one out of every 250) were murdered during the year. Serbian forces allegedly
 committed several murders along the confrontation line, including the mass murder
 of five men in May in Sector West, and the killing of a fisherman near the Dalma-
 tian coast in August. Police apprehended no suspects. A Dutch citizen fighting in
 the Croatian armed forces died while in custody of Serbian forces several days after
 his capture near the front lines in April.
 Serbian obstructionism continued to block the excavation of the mass grave sites
 in the UNPA's. In the case of the mass grave of presumed murdered Serbs exhumed
 in Sector West in October 1993, the Croatian Government has still not brought any
 charges.
 b. Disappearance.-There were few new cases of disappearances reported. At
 yeais end, the Government reported more than 2,500 cases of missing persons still
 unresolved from the 1991-1992 war. This figure was down from over 7,000 cases
 at the beginning of the year. Progress was made in removing names from the list
 of the missing as a result of prisoner and body exchanges.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution prohibits torture or cruel or degrading punishment, but govern-
 
 
 779
 ment forces continued to commit such abuses. There were credible reports that secu-
 rity forces frequently beat and mistreated prisoners during detention and interroga-
 tion, particularly early in the year. The best documented cases typically involved
 Serbian or Muslim prisoners. Helsinki Watch indicated in February that the au-
 thorities at Lora prison in Split had engaged in the torture and beating of prisoners
 who were former Yugoslav National Army (JNA) reservists. Six Serbs captured in
 early July, however, who the Croats claim had infiltrated across the front lines, re-
 ported no beatings or mistreatment to the European Community Monitoring Mission
 which visited them.
 Detention facilities generally meet accepted standards of cleanliness, nutrition,
 and amenities. Jails are crowded, but not to excess, and family visits and access to
 counsel are available.
 Prison conditions in the Serb-controlled UNPA's, however, are reliably reported to
 be abysmal. Harsh treatment of non-Serbs is commonplace, and the Serbian "au-
 thorities" do not punish abusers. Two journalists who were detained in December
 by local police and paramilitary forces were beaten, as well as subjected to psycho-
 logical torture, such as death threats.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution contains provisions to
 protect the legal rights of all accused, but the Government does not respect these
 rights in practice. The Government frequently abuses pretrial and investigative de-
 tention. Most cases of arbitrary arrest or detention involved Muslim residents and
 refugees in Croatia early in the year, while Croatian and Bosnian government
 troops were fighting in neighboring Bosnia and Herzegovina. There were no large-
 scale police sweeps nor attempted forced repatriations such as took place in late
 1993, but refugee organizations continued to report instances in which police arbi-
 trarily detained Muslim refugees from Bosnia and Herzegovina and threatened
 them with forcible expulsion.
 Police normally seek arrest warrants by presenting evidence of probable cause to
 an interrogating magistrate. Police may arrest a suspect without a warrant if they
 believe he might flee, destroy evidence, or commit other crimes. If police arrest a
 suspect without a warrant, they have 24 hours in which to justify their decision be-
 fore the local interrogating magistrate.
 After arrest, persons must be given access to an attorney of their choice within
 24 hours; if they have no attorney, the interrogating magistrate will appoint one
 from a list of public defenders. The interrogating judge must, within 3 days of the
 arrest, decide whether sufficient cause exists to hold the arrestee in custody, pend-
 ing further investigation. The judge must justify the decision in writing, including
 the length of detention ordered. These decisions may be appealed, either imme-
 diately or later during the detention period. The usual period of investigative deten-
 tion varies from a few days to a few weeks but by law may be as long as 2 years.
 Accused persons have the right to have their attorney present during the entire in-
 vestigation as well as during any appeal of investigative detention. While this is
 typically the case, there were instances in which detainees did not have adequate
 access to legal counsel.
 In practice, arrestees are almost always bound over for investigation unless it is
 clear no case against them exists. Once the investigation is complete, persons are
 usually released on their own recognizance pending trial, unless the crime is a
 major offense or the accused is considered a public danger. There are no provisions
 for posting bail, although police will sometimes retain the accused's passport to pre-
 vent him from leaving the country.
 In the Serb-controlled areas of the UNPA's, virtually no safeguards exist against
 arbitrary detention, and Serbian forces continued to use detention to intimidate
 non-Serbs. Many cases involved residents of the Bihac pocket in western Bosnia and
 Herzegovina, who had to transit Serb-held territory to reach the outside world. In
 August Serbian forces arrested a Catholic'priest as he fled the fighting in the Bihae
 pocket and held him for several weeks without charge before his release could be
 negotiated. Serbian forces also commonly arrested Croatian civilians in the separa-
 tion zone created by the March cease-fire agreement, charging that they were ille-
 galy attempting to enter the "RSK.'
 The Constitution prohibits exile, and it is not practiced.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The legal system consists of municipal and district
 courts, a Supreme Court, and a Constitutional Court. The High Judicial Council
 (with a president and 14 members from all parts of the legal community) appoints
 judges and public prosecutors. Judicial tenure is permanent. The House of Counties
 nominates persons for membership on the High Judicial Council, and the House of
 Representatives elects members to 8-year terms. The 11 judges of the Constitutional
 Court are elected to 8-year terms in the same manner.
 
 
 780
 The judicial process is not free of ethnic bias or political influence. The Govern-
 ment has not yet established the Provisional Court of Human Rights, mandated by
 a 1992 constitutional law on minorities. The eme rency measures established in
 1991 are still being applied, despite a number of appeals by the U.N. Special
 Rapporteur that these be abolished. The orders provide or the suspension of certain
 remedies in legal proceedings and give the six-court military legal system jurisdic-
 tion over a large number of cases involving civilians.
 Although the Constitution provides for the right to a fair trial and a variety of
 due process rights in both civilian and military courts, in practice, the prosecuting
 attorney has leeway in deciding whether to bring a case against an individual, and,
 in cases considered "political, both the indictment and the conduct of trials are
 sometimes subject to outside influence. In the case of nine members of the Dalma-
 tian Action Party arrested on suspicion of having plotted the bombing of their own
 political party offices in September 1993, the local military court took jurisdiction.
 Two trial sessions were held, the latest in April. Observers believe that as the case
 looked increasingly weak, the prosecution decided to suspend action. the prosecu-
 tion did not dismiss the charges however, which observers decried as an attempt
 to keep the defendants in legal limbo in order to hamper their political activities.
 The legal system in the Serlb-controlled UNPA's remained a sham, with its proce-
 dures and practices increasingly open to outside interference by those in power.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution declares the home inviolable. Only a court may issue a search warrant,
 stating the justification for the search of a home or other premises. Police may enter
 a home without a warrant or the owner's consent only if necessary to enforce an
 arrest warrant, apprehend a suspect, or prevent serious danger to life or important
 property. In practice, the authorities often failed to adhere to these constitutional
 requirements.
 Military or civil police carried out evictions by force, involving several hundred
 families, ethnic Serbs and Croats as well as Muslims. In Split, 230 families were
 reported to be seeking through the courts to remove soldiers who had seized their
 apartments. Almost all of these cases involved apartments previously owned by the
 JNA, over which the Ministry of Defense asserted ownersip. Referring to property
 laws which remove tenancy rights as a result of any 6-month absence or if the ten-
 ant is ruled to have acted against the interests of Croatia, the Ministry of Defense
 granted soldiers tenancy of occupied flats. The soldiers then frequently took resi-
 dences by force of arms, either evicting the current tenants or forcing them to co-
 habitate.
 During the year, human rights organizations became increasingly effective at call-
 ing public attention to forced evictions, and their members turned up in large num-
 bers at the announced time of the eviction. But in at least two cases, police beat
 and injured human rights monitors seeking to obstruct an eviction. In May the De-
 fense Ministry issued public orders to remove any soldiers who had illegally forced
 their way into an apartment, using force if necessary. But military police never car-
 ried out these orders, reporting privately to observers that their commanders had
 told them to refrain from arresting the soldiers. The tenants of these apartments
 were typically Serbian families or the spouses and children of Serbs in the JNA who
 had left Croatia. At a July 12 press conference, President Tudjman justified the
 forced evictions by linking them to the Serbian aggression against Croatia and evic-
 tion of one-quarter million Croats.
 The Constitution guarantees the secrecy and safety of personal data, but it was
 unclear if such guarantees were adhered to in practice.
 Serbian authorities in the UNPA's showed no compunction about interfering with
 the privacy rights of the inhabitants of those areas, particularly non-Serbs.
 UNPROFOR continued to provide 24-hour patrols of several minority villages to
 protect the inhabitants from armed bands. The practice of forcibly moving Serbian
 refugees or soldiers into the homes of non-Serb residents continued as well, which
 was clearly designed to pressure the non-Serbs to leave. One couple in Sector West
 was forced to live in their pantry after Serbian soldiers took over the remainder of
 the house and Serbian refugees moved into their outbuildings. Inhabitants were
 even denied the right to talk on the telephone, with the authorities putting severe
 restrictions on international observers who provided mobile telephones to villagers
 during visits to permit them to call relatives on the other side of the line.
 g. Use of Excessive Force and Violations of Humanitarian Law in Internal Con-
 flicts.-On March 29, the Government and the leadership of the "RSK" signed a
 comprehensive cease-fire agreement in Zagreb, the capital, which successfully re-
 duced the amount of shelling to almost zero and the number of shooting incidents
 by about 99 percent. There were only a handful of fatalities during the year from
 shooting incidents involving cease-fire violations. However, occasional shelling did
 
 
 781
 occur from Bosnian Serb positions bordering Croatia, most commonly onto the
 Slavonian city of Zupanja and onto the area around the Dubrovnik airport. These
 attacks caused substantial property damage but no reported fatalities.
 In October and November, the "RSK" military began a concentrated campaign of
 bombardment and ground attacks against the territory held by the Government of
 Bosnia and Herzegovina in a re konnown as the Bihac pocket. The Krajina Serbs
 coordinated these attacks with Bosnian Serb and rebel Muslim forces. The bombings
 included both artillery and air attacks and were frequently directed against civilian
 population centers such as Bihac town, Cazin, and Velika ladusa. Targets included
 the civilian hospital in Bihac. Numerous civilian casualties resulted from the at-
 tacks. In addition, the "RSK" used restriction of humanitarian aid as a weapon
 against the population of the Bihac pocket completely shutting off access to govern-
 ment-controlled portions of the pocket for U.N. aid convoys from May until late De-
 cember.
 With small steps toward normalization along the confrontation line under the
 March 25 cease-fire, the extent of previous mine-laying during the conflict was in-
 creasingly evident. UNPROFOR troops, as well as soldiers and civilians from both
 sides, were victims of unmarked and uncleared minefields. A particularly dangerous
 situation arose in August when the forces of Bosnian Muslim rebel leader Fikret
 Abdic were defeated by the Bosnian army and tens of thousands of people left the
 Bihac pocket, forcing their way into the separation zone to demand entry into gov-
 ernment-controlled Croatia. The Government refused to grant entry, and the refu-
 gees refused to turn back and leave the heavily mined area. Despite efforts by
 UTNPROFOR to clear the immediate area of mines, several refugees were injured by
 mine explosions.
 Croatian citizens, originally from Bosnia and Herzegovina, reported that the Gov-
 ernment forcibly mobilized them to fight in the Bosnian Croat paramilitary forces
 during the first few months of the year.
 For 5 weeks in the summer, Croats displaced from the Serb-occupied areas of Cro-
 atia blocked all checkpoints into the UNPA's, protesting the ineffectiveness of
 UNPROFOR in reintegrating the occupied territories into Croatia and in assisting
 the return of the displaced to their homes. They also accused UNPROFOR of sup-
 plying the Serbs with nonhumanitarian supplies, including fuel. UNPROFOR ac-
 cused the Government of being behind the b ockades and violating its international
 legal obligations. While it was not clear that the Government actually organized the
 blockades, the protesters clearly enjoyed government sympathy and support. After
 the Government negotiated an inspection procedure to verify that UROFOR per-
 sonnel were not transporting any contraband into the UNPA's, the blockade was lift-
 ed.
 In the Serb-occupied UNPA's, expulsions, in the form of ethnic cleansing, contin-
 ued to be used aggressively and with the blessing of local "officials" against Croats,
 Hungarians, Slovaks, Czechs, and      other non-Serbs. Throughout the year
 UNPROFOR and other international agencies organized the transit of a slow but
 steady stream of non-Serbs out of the UNPA's.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of
 thought and expression, specifically including freedom of the press and other media
 of communication, speech, and public expression, and free establishment of institu-
 tions of public communication. In practice, government influence on the media
 through state ownership of most print and broadcast outlets limits these freedoms.
 In addition, government intimidation induces self-censorship. Politicians, political
 activists, and journalists are often reluctant to criticize the Government in public
 forums for fear of harassment, job loss, intimidation, or being labeled a traitor to
 war-torn Croatia.
 The Government controls all national television broadcasting and all but one na-
 tional radio station, and retains a controlling interest in two of four news dailies
 and some weeklies. The sale of a majority of shares in the leading newspaper,
 Vjesnik, to a local bank appeared to increase rather than reduce government influ-
 ence at the paper. The chairman of the bank's board of directors is an HDZ Member
 of Parliament, and the editor in chief of the paper was replaced in December by a
 less experienced journalist, who despite claiming no party affiliation, had close links
 with the HDZ. Although these state-controlled or heavily state-influenced media,
 particularly the press, frequently carry reportage critical of the Government, govern-
 ment control nonetheless ensures an overall editorial slant generally favorable to
 the Government and the HDZ. Each of the opposition parties is allocated 4 minutes
 of television time per week. Access to the print media is minimal, with occasional
 coverage of press conferences and interviews. Two nationally publicized instances of
 
 
 782
 physical threats against journalists by local politicians generated media debate but
 no action by the Government.
 A few newspapers continue to guard their independence including the daily Novi
 List in Rijeka, the weekly Globus, the intellectual bimontily journal Erasmus, the
 satirical weekly Feral Tribune, and the weekly Arkzin, published by "the Antiwar
 Campaign." A new weekly, Pecat, with an independent editorial line began publish-
 ing  in  September. Even    some   extremist publications   with  a  virulently
 antigovernment slant, could be purchased at newsstands, athough they had very
 small circulation. The highly popular Feral Tribune, whose material continued to
 push the boundaries of good taste, was reclassified for tax purposes as a porno-
 graphic magazine and, therefore, subject to a 50-percent turnover tax. The Minister
 of Culture admitted that this reclassification was a result of Feral's continuing at-
 tacks on the Government. International papers and journals remained available
 throughout government-controlled areas, including Serbian periodicals which sub-
 scribers continued to receive by mail.
 Croatia has four major television channels, as well as regional stations in Zadar,
 Split, Vinkovci, and Osijek. Zagreb-based Channels One, Two, and Four are part of
 the official Croatian Radio and Television enterprise (HTV), headed by a well-nown
 HDZ member. Zagreb Channel Three, OTV-youth television, with a signal that
 reaches only the capital district, has an uncertain legal status and operates at the
 sufferance of the Government.
 Parliament in July passed a broadcasting law providing for the allocation of radio
 and television frequencies to new, private outlets, but the Government has not yet
 implemented it. Private local radio stations operate under provisional licenses in
 Croatia, but their legal status is open to question until the media law is imple-
 mented. The broadcasting law mandates that one parliamentary member of the
 Council for Croatian Television be a minority representative, but this person has not
 yet been appointed. A seven-member council of government and nongovernmental
 representatives, established by Parliament in 1993 to protect the freedom of the
 press, has yet to meet because Parliament failed to appoint a chairman until late
 in the year.
 In the Serb-controlled portions of the UNPA's, freedom of speech and press vir-
 tually does not exist. With martial law still in effect, there are no guarantees of
 press and other freedoms, and the authorities control the tone and content of the
 media. Serbian papers, usually published in Belgrade, are generally available, al-
 though the supply is sometimes sporadic. There is one small paper published weekly
 or biweekly in Serbian in Sector North.
 A few low-powered local radio "stations" broadcast from Serb-held territory in
 some of the UNPA's, and Croatian radio and television signals are received in these
 areas as well. The Serbian Television Krajina, whose studios are in Petrova Gora
 and Knin, broadcasts daily. Two other Serbian mobile studios operate out of Bell
 Manastir and Plitvice.
 Academic freedom is generally respected in Croatia. However, there is apprehen-
 sion within the academic community concerning the centralizing effects on faculty
 and programs of the university reform law. When it became apparent that the new
 government Council for Higher Education could not review all the revised academic
 programs prior to the start of the 1994-95 school year, the Government delayed in-
 troduction of the new curriculums.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides that
 all citizens have the right to peaceful assembly and association for the protection
 of citizens' interests or the promotion of social, economic, political, national, cultural,
 and other convictions and objectives. Citizens may freely form, join, and leave politi-
 cal parties, trade unions, and other associations. In practice, the rights of peaceful
 assembly and association are respected in Croatia. The Government requires per-
 mits for rallies but grants them routinely. Political parties, refugee associations,
 women's groups, and others held peaceful rallies and demonstrations without hin-
 drance or incident. These gatherings included events which both supported and
 criticized government policies. All citizens enjoyed these rights, including members
 of the Serbian and Muslim communities.
 In Serb-controlled areas, however, these rights were not respected. In the fall,
 local media reported that several men were arrested in the Serb-held town of
 Benkovac when they protested a recent military mobilization by local Serbian au-
 thorities.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-There is no state religion. The Constitution provides for
 freedom of conscience and religion and free public profession of religious and other
 convictions. All religious communities are free to conduct public services and to open
 and run social and charitable institutions. Roman Catholicism, Eastern Orthodox
 Christianity, and Islam are the major faiths in Croatia, and there is also an active
 
 
 Jewish community. The majority of practicing Croats are Roman Catholic, and the
 Government provides an option of Catholic religious education in schools.
 There are no formal restrictions on religious groups. The main mosque in Croatia
 is in Zagreb, where it serves not only as a religious center but also as a social aid
 office for the large Bosnian Muslim refugee population. Croatian Protestants from
 a number of denominations, as well as foreign clergy, actively practice and pros-
 elytize. Some foreign religious organizations seeking tproide social services re-
 ported bureaucratic obstacles to their establishment in Croatia but it was unclear
 if this had any connection to their religious character. A Baptist church seeking to
 purchase property for a new church site also reported problems receiving the nec-
 essary approvals.
 The close identification of religion with ethnicity had earlier caused religious insti-
 tutions to be targets of violence. The investigation into the bombing of the Serbian
 Orthodox eparchy in Karlovac on December 24, 1993, led to no arrests. During the
 night of December 20, a bomb exploded inside the Orthodox church of the eastern
 Slavonian city of Osijek, causing some damage. Police have not arrested any sus-
 pects. The Serbian Orthodox Cathedral in downtown Zagreb remained open, and
 several other Orthodox churches and monasteries operated freely in government-
 controlled Croatia. Although the majority of Orthodox clergy left at the start of the
 war in 1991, a few priests and nuns, most of them retired, remained to carry out
 religious duties. International human rights monitors said these clergy reported
 generally good relations with their Catholic neighbors.
 Most Catholic churches in the Serb-occupied UNPA's have been destroyed. In Sec-
 tor East, only one active Catholic priest (a Slovak) remained.
 While most requests for conscientious objector exemption from military service
 were granted, a human rights organization voiced concern over the denial of con-
 scientious objector status earlier in the year to some who refused mobilization to
 fight in the Bosnian Croat paramilitary forces against the Bosnan government
 army. Serbian human rights groups also claimed that the authorities withheld con-
 scientious objector status from ethnic Serbs who were called up for service, includ-
 ing several who were awaiting final rulings on their citizenship status and were
 therefore not obligated for military service. There is no provision for conscientious
 objector status in the Serb-occupied areas.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-Although the Constitution states that anyone who is lawfully in Croatia
 has the right freely to move and choose a residence, the Government places certain
 restrictions on this right. All persons must register their residence with the local
 authorities. There are no reports that anyone has been refused the right to register
 a change of residence, except in cases where the lodging arrangements are irregular
 (i.e., an unauthorized sublet). One purpose of the law, which is a holdover from the
 previous system, is to ensure that landlords are properly declaring rent, and to en-
 sure that individuals with "residence rights" to "socially owned" apartments are not
 earning illegal rental income.
 Citizens have the right to travel abroad, to emigrate, and to return home. Under
 exceptional circumstances, the Government may legally restrict the right to enter
 or leave the country if necessary to protect the "legal order, health, rights, or free-
 doms of others." There is no evidence of government abuse of this authority. There
 are no reports of authorities refusing entry or exit to any Croatian citizens, except
 in infrequent cases of military personnel denied leave when requested.
 There are restrictions on freedom of movement for all journalists and all male citi-
 zens from age 18 through 55 in the cities and areas close to the confrontation lines.
 Journalists, as well as others, must request permission to enter the conflict zones.
 The Government imposed no significant legal restrictions on the movement of ref-
 ugees, displaced persons, or national minorities resident in Croatia. Many refugees,
 however, were housed in remote locations with little or no means of public trans-
 port. There were several confirmed cases of forcible return of refugees to Bosnia and
 Herzegovina. The Government tried to enforce strictly a policy of admitting no new
 refugees unless transit to a third country was assured. In practice, large numbers
 of refugees, primarily Muslims forced from Serb-held northern Bosnia by ethnic
 cleansing campaigns, entered Croatia and stayed, although the number was much
 lower than in 1992 or 1993.
 The Government also continued into early in the year to relocate refugees from
 coastal tourist facilities to inland areas. Often this policy met with resistance from
 refugee groups who did not want to be uprooted and separated from the people with
 whom they had spent the last 2 years. In one highly publicized case, police and mili-
 tary recruits forcibly loaded the largely Muslim refugee population of the Savudrija
 camp in Istria onto buses and sent them to three other facilities. The authorities
 then turned over the Savudrija camp to the mainly Bosnian Croat residents who
 
 
 had been living at the Pineta tourist resort, which was being returned to its Slove-
 nian owners.
 The authorities in Serb-controlled areas continued to enforce a coercive regime,
 including curfews and strict travel limitations near the front lines. Threats against
 the non-Serbs in protected villages effectively confined them to their homes. Serbs
 who crossed over from government-controlled Croatia were eagerly welcomed for
 propaganda purposes.
 At year's end, an estimated 20,000 of these refugees remained on Serb-occupied
 territory in Croatia, although some 6,000 men from this group had been mobilized
 by Krajina Serb and rebel Muslim forces to fight in the Bihac pocket in neighboring
 Bosnia and Herzegovina. Up to 5,000 refugees were believed by the UNHCR to have
 left the camps, apparently for territory taken by the rebel Muslim forces, but infor-
 mation on their numbers or whereabouts was sketchy at best. When the Croatian
 Government refused to permit entry, the Serbian authorities provided temporary
 shelter to some, while abetting the movement of some 15,000 others into a no man s
 land in a cease-fire zone near Karlovac.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Croatia is a multiparty democracy in which all citizens 18 years of age and older
 have the right to vote by secret ballot. The President, elected for 5 years, exercises
 substantial power, authority, and influence but is constitutionally limited to two
 terms. Parliament is composed of the House of Representatives and the House of
 Zupan'je or Counties, and the Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ) holds a majority
 in both houses. Its leader, President Franjo Tudjman, was reelected in 1992. Ser-
 bian authorities in the UNPA's refused to allow residents in the areas they control
 to participate in the Croatian election.
 Although there are no legal restrictions on participation by women or minorities
 in the political process, they are represented in only small numbers in Parliament,
 the executive branch, and the courts. Nine women hold seats in Parliament, includ-
 ing one who is the president of the House of Counties and two who led opposition
 parties. Federal election law requires representation for minorities in Parliament,
 with proportional representation for any minority that makes up more than 8 per-
 cent of the population. The Federal Election Commission designated 13 Serbs to
 "represent" the Serbian community in Croatia, which comprises 11 percent of the
 population, in the 138-seat House of Representatives. The Social Democratic Party
 the reformed Communist party), which had received 5.4 percent of the popular vote,
 obtained 7 of these 13 seats, and the Serbian People's Party, constituted to rep-
 resent the Serbian community's interests, which hadreceived over 1 percent of the
 vote, obtained 3 seats.
 The "RSK" held elections in December 1993, which neither UNPROFOR nor any
 other international body recognized as legitimate. No international or other unbi-
 ased observers were present, and the "RSK" authorities clearly manipulated the
 vote. After "RSK" authorities declared that no candidate had received the necessary
 50 percent of the votes to win the "presidency" (which reportedly required the an-
 nulment of many ballots), they called for a second round of voting inJanuary. With
 Belgrade's control of local media outlets, the results of the second round reversed
 those of December and Milan Martic, the candidate supported by Serbian President
 Milosevic, "won" tle "presidency.' The "parliament" had a strong plurality of rival
 Milan Babic's party members. No minorities are represented in either the "par-
 liament" or the "government.'
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Human rights groups in Zagreb, Split, Rijeka, and Osijek worked to prevent
 human rights abuses in their respective localities and brought their concerns to the
 attention of local and national authorities as well as domestic and international
 media. Principal areas of activity were problems of forced evictions (see Section 1.f.),
 citizenship rights and employment discrimination (see Section 5), and conscientious
 objectors (see Section 2.c.).
 Government officials continued to refer to certain prominent human rights organi-
 zations and activists in highly critical terms in public statements and interviews.
 Police also failed to arrest any perpetrators in cases involving personal threats or
 attacks against them or their property. But over the course of the year, government
 authorities began to address more seriously some of the primary concerns of human
 rights organizations, such as citizenship rights and evictions, engaging in a public
 dialog particularly on the latter issue. olice were also ordered to refrain from using
 force against demonstrators at the sites of planned evictions. Despite the increased
 
 
 785
 dialog, however, human rights groups remained highly critical of the Government's
 human rights record.
 The situation in Split continued to be most hazardous for human rights monitors
 due to threats from local extremists. Local police beat one monitor as he attempted
 to prevent a forced eviction. Human rights workers in Zagreb also reported receiving
 threats against themselves and their families. The home of Slobodan Budak, a
 prominent human rights lawyer and deputy chairman of the Croatian Human
 Rights Committee, was severely damaged by a bomb on the day before he was to
 cochair a conference on human rights and the issue of forced evictions.
 Major local human rights groups include the Croatian Helsinki Commission, the
 Antiwar Campaign, theDalnatian Solidarity Committee, the Dalmatian Committee
 for Human Rights, and the Center for Peace and Human Rights. The Serbian Peo-
 ples' Party and the Social Democratic Union have human rights committees. The
 Serbian Democratic Forum, another local human rights group, focused primarily on
 the concerns of the Serbian community. All of these  ups  ave publicly criticized
 the Government's human rights policy. International human rights organizations
 were also active in Croatia.
 The Government cooperated with international investigations of war crimes car-
 ried out by the U.N. Commssion of Experts, permitting free access to refugees for
 gathering eyewitness testimony, even mn cases mn which Croats were the likely per-
 petrators of the witnessed atrocities. The Government pledged its cooperation with
 the International Tribunal for the Prosecution of War Crimes in the Former Yugo-
 slavia in The Hague.
 Serbian forces did not permit the formation or functioning of local human rights
 groups and impeded the work of international human rights groups. Many inter-
 national relief organizations refrained from undertaking operations in the Serb-ac-
 cupied territories rather than accept the Serbs' demandthat they acknowledge the
 "RSK" as an independent state. Only U.N. personnel and the European Community
 Monitoring Mission can observe human rights practices in these areas.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution specifies that all citizens shall enjoy all rights and freedoms, re-
 gardless of race, color, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or
 social oriGinproperty, birth, education, social status, or other attributes. It adds
 that memrs of all nations and minorities shall have equal rights in Croatia. With
 the exceptions noted below, these rights areobserved in practice. One article pro-
 vides for special "wartime measures but satea that restrictions shall be appro-
 priate to the nature of the danger and may not result in the inequality of citizenship
 with respect to race, color, sex, language, religion, or national or social origin. Under
 these measures, these rights have been observed in practice.
 Women.-The law does not discriminate by gender. In practice, however, women
 generally hold lower paying positions in the work force. The majority of high school
 and elementary teachers, nurses, and clerical workers are female.
 Although the Government does not collect statistic, informed observers state that
 violence against women, including spouse abuse, is common and that the number
 of incidents has increased in the last few years. Alcohol abuse is commonly cited
 as a contributing factor. Centers for the psychological and medical care of abused
 women are open in several cities, and there is a 24-hour hot line in a Zagreb medi-
 cal center. A number of local institutions and voluntary agencies offer social, medi-
 cal, and other assistance to abused women and to those traumatized by war experi-
 ences. Family crisis associations are also active.
 Although the number of female-led organizations has increased sinc te  war,
 most are devoted to antiwa  r humanitarian causes and are poorly organized and
 poorly funded. There is no national organization of women devoted to the protection
 of women's rights.
 Chidren.-The Government has made a strong commitment to the welfare of chil-
 dren. Schools provide free meals for children, day nurseries are available in most
 communities even for infants, and medical care for children is free. There is no dec-
 umented pattern of societal abuse or discrimination against children.
 National/Raial/Ethnic Minorities.--Other sections of this report address serious
 human rights abuses suffered by persons based on their nationality, including cases
 of government abuse of ethnic Serbs.
 Constitutionay, Croatian Serbs enjoy the same protection as other self-identified
 ethnic groups in the country. In practice, however, there continues to be ever-
 present, subtle, and sometimes open discrimination against Serbs in such areas as
 the administration of justice, employment, housing, and the free exercise of their
 cultural rights. Serbs continu oe  e particularly vulnerable to attack bcause of the
 
 
 786
 Government's reluctance rigorously to protect their rights. Attacks against property
 owned by Serbs, or even Croats with Serb-sounding names, continued in 1994,
 though at a lesser rate than in previous years. Serbs in Croatia also continued to
 receive anonymous threats by ma   u, phone, and facsimile (fax) but in fewer numbers
 than in previous years. Many Ser s left government-controlled Croatia during the
 year as a result of the combination of economic discrimination and physical threats.
 The makeup of the police force, which consists almost exclusively of ethnic Croats,
 some with little experience or training in police work, contributed to the problem.
 As in previous years, the vast majority of cases involving violence against Serbs
 went unpunished. In one case in Split, an eyewitness informed the police of the
 identities of the vandals--all members of the Croatian army, but the police made
 no arrests. In another case, members of the police force abducted a recently retired
 ethnic Serbian policeman, interrogated him for information about Serbian extremist
 groups, and beat him severely before releasing him.
 Particularly in the early months of the year, the Muslim community in Croatia
 also suffered from harsh ethnic discrimination. Croatian attacks against Muslims
 occurred particularly on the Dalmatian coast where there was a large population
 of Muslin refugees side by side with Croatian soldiers on leave from the front lines
 in Bosnia and Herzegovina (where they had been fighting against the mostly Mus-
 lim Bosnian army). International refugee organizations took great pains to provide
 what protection they could to the Muslim refugees and rushed through hundreds
 of cases for resettlement to third countries. With the signing of the Muslim-Croat
 truce and federation agreement in March, Croatian violence against Muslims de-
 clined drastically. Muslims report continued widespread discrimination in many
 areas, such as citizenship and employment rights.
 The Government's practice of discriminating in the issuance of citizenship papers
 toward ethnic minorities, particularly Serbs and Muslims, drew sharp criticism.
 Human rights groups have numerous documented cases in which the Interior Min-
 istry denied citizenship papers to long-term residents of Croatia (i.e., resident in
 Croatia long before the country declared its independence). They estimated that the
 Interior Ministry denied over 13,000 applications for citizenship, the large majority
 ethnic Serbs or Montenegrins or persons who had held positions of importance in
 former Yugoslav federal institutions, particularly the JNA.
 Human rights groups complain that the Interior Ministry almost always based its
 denials on Article 26 of the Law on Citizenship, which permits it to deny citizenship
 papers to persons other     qualified to be citizens of Croatia if it judges there are
 reasons of national interest to do so. In December 1993 the law was amended to
 strike langua  that the reasons for denial should not be explained. But no lan-
 guage was aaed to say that the reasons for denial must be explained, and human
 rights organizations reported that the police continued to refuse citizenship applica-
 tions without full explanation.
 The Law on Citizenship clearly distinguishes between those with a claim to Cro-
 atian ethniciy and those without. The      ian p   e" are eligible to become citi-
 zens of Croatia even if they did not have previous citizenship of the former Socialist
 Republic of Croatia, as long as they submit a written statement that they consider
 themselves Croatian citizens. Those who do not belong to the Croatian people must
 satisfy more stringent requirements through naturlization in order to obtain citi-
 zenship, even if they were previously lawful residents of Croatia as citizens of the
 former Yugoslavia. While an application for citizenship is pending, the applicant is
 considered an alien in Croatia and is consequently denied rights such as social al-
 lowances, including medical care, pensions, free education, and employment in the
 civil service.
 Serbs and other ethnic minorities also suffered from economic discrimination. The
 U.N. Special Rapportur on Human Rights noted in his report that "it appears that
 Serbs and Muslims are always the first to be dismissed.* * *" While the difacult
 economic situation in Croatia continued to cause high unemployment for all sectors
 of scinety, the Sinclil  apporteur's concern was amplified by a large number of
 credible reports tatSerbsah n ore a dispropoonate buren in layoffs by a brad vari-
 et. of employers. Throughout the year, human rights organizations continued to re-
 ceive inquiries from Serbs who had been fired from their jobs as far back as 1992.
 While in many cases it was impossible to determine the proximate cause for the fir-
 ing of an employee, there were cases in which the employee's ethnicity was the stat-
 ed reason. In one case, a doctor of mixed background was removed from a job in
 a military clinic because his ethnic background was deemed unsuitable for treating
 wounded Croatian soldiers. In another case, an ethnic Croatian teacher was fired
 after a pupil proclaimed her a "Chetnik" (Serbian extremist), referring to her hus-
 band, an ethnic Serb who fled Croatia in 1991. In some cases, despite court orders
 which confinied the employee's right to employment or reinstatement to a previous
 
 
 787
 position, the employer still refused to rehire workers who had been out of work since
 1992.
 The Roma minority continued to face societal discrimination and official inaction
 when complaints were filed. The Croatian Roma Party claimed that, although the
 officially registered number of Roma in Croatia was 120,000, the actual figure was
 closer to between 250,000 and 300,000 because many Roma do not bother to reg-
 ister. The population of Bosnian Roma refugees in Croatia was difficult to estimate
 since the Roma population was so fluid. Other minority groups--Slovaks, Czechs,
 ItaliansHungarians-did not report any significant discrimination.
 The abysa     tment of non-Serb minorities in the Serb-occupied UNPA's is dis-
 cussed in other sections of this report.
 People With Disabilities.-There is no specific legislation mandating access to
 buildings or government services for people with disabilities. However, people with
 disabilities face no discriminatory measures, and education and job opportunities
 generally are available.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution provides that all workers, except
 military and pic personnel, are entitled to form or join unions of their own choos-
 ing without prior authorization. There is an active labr movement with three na-
 tional labor federations and independent associations of both blue-collar and white-
 collar members. In general, unions are independent of the Government and political
 parties. Unions may affiliate internationally.
 The Constitution provides for the right to strike except in the armed forces, police,
 government administration, and public services. Strikes by teachers, textile workers,
 and others occurred frequently, in part over the repeated failure of government-
 owned or government-run institutions or industries to pay wages on time. Few
 strikes could be termed successful, as the Government hewed closely to the austerity
 program it implemented in October 1993 as part of its economic stabilization pro-
 gram.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Collective bargaining is pro-
 tected by law and practiced freely. Because of inflation and government austerity
 measures, the major public service unions found themselves engaged throughout the
 year in lengthy negotiations with the Government over wages and job security. Like
 fellow unionists, the federations found that the Government was regularly late in
 meeting its parll and in ensuring payment of minimum wages.
 Many "socially owned" enterprises have been "transformed7 or nationalized as a
 first step towards rivatization. In the current transition to privatization and a free
 market economy, te unions are nder pressure due to job losses, general unemploy-
 ment in a weakened economy, and their own struggle to become genuine free trade
 unions.
 There is no formal body of law or practice dealing directly with antiunion dis-
 crimination issues. Croatia's trade union federations allege that union membership
 frequently constitute grounds for employment discrimination through transfers to
 lower paid jobs, suspensions, disciplinary proceedings, dismissals, and forced retire-
 ments. They also allege that management interferes in union elections. The unions
 have taken some cases to court.
 There are no export processing zones.
 C. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Constitution prohibits forced
 or compulsory work, and there were no documented instances of it. The Ministry
 of Labor and Social Welfare enforces this prohibition.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The minimum age for youth em-
 ployment is 15 years, which the Ministry of Labor and Social Welfare enforces.
 rnder the Constitution, children may not be employed before reaching the legally
 determined age, nor may they be forced or allowed to do work that is harmful to
 their health or morality. Workers under 18 years of age are entitled to special pro-
 tection at work and are prohibited from heavy manual labor. Education is manda-
 tory up to age 14.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-There are national minimum wage standards.
 Public service unions are pacesetters for the rest of the work force, and they were
 in the forefront of continuing efforts to encourage the Government to honor its com-
 mitments. The minimum gross monthly wage was roughly $92 (536.91 kuna).
 National regulations provide for a 42-hour workweek, overtime pay, a half-hour
 daily break, and a minimum of 18 days of paid vacation annually. It is standard
 practice to provide a 24-hour rest period during the workweek.
 The Government sets health and safety standards, and the Ministry of Health is
 charged with enforcing them. In practice, industries are not diligent in meeting
 standards for worker protection, and the Ministry does not enforce them effectively.
