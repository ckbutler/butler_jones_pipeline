 BHUTAN              -        '
 Bhutan is a monarchy without a constitution or a bill of rights. The Wangchuk
 Dynasty of hereditary monarchs has ruled the country since 1907. King, Jigme
 Singhye Wangchuk, on the throne since 1972, has continued efforts towar, social
 
 
 1877
 and political modernization begun by his father. In recent years, there has been
 rapid progress in education, health, sanitation, and communications, and an in-
 crease in elected representatives and their role in decisionmaking. In June the King
 introduced term limits for his Council of Ministers and proposed measures to in-
 crease the role of the National Assembly in the formation of his Government. The
 judiciary is not independent of the King.
 Approximately two-thirds of the government-declared population of 600,000 is
 composed of Buddhists with cultural traditions akin to those of Tibet. The Buddhist
 majority comprises two principal ethnic and linguistic groups: the Ngalongs of west-
 ern Bhutan and the Sharchops of eastern Bhutan. The remaining third of the popu-
 lation, ethnic Nepalis, most of whom are Hindus, live in the country's southern dis-
 tricts. Bhutanese dissident groups claim that the actual population is between
 650,000 and 700,000 and that the Government underreports the number of ethnic
 Nepalese in the country. The rapid growth of this ethnic Nepalese segment of the
 population led some in the Buddhist majority to fear for the survival of their cul-
 ture. Government efforts to tighten citizenship requirements and to control illegal
 immigration resulted in political protests and led to ethnic conflict and repression
 of ethnic Nepalese in southern districts during the late 1980's and early 1990's.
 Tens of thousands of ethnic Nepalese left Bhutan in 1991-92, many forcibly ex-
 pelled. Approximately 91,000 ethnic Nepalese remain in refugee camps in Nepal and
 upwards of 15,000 reside outside the camps in the Indian states of Assam and West
 Bengal. The Government maintains that some of those in the camps were never citi-
 zens of Bhutan, and therefore have no right to return. In 1998 the Government
 began resettling Bhutanese from other regions on land vacated by refugees in south-
 ern Bhutan. A National Assembly resolution adopted in 1997 prohibits still-resident
 immediate family members of ethnic Nepalese refugees from holding jobs with the
 Government or the armed forces. In early 1998, the Government implemented the
 resolution, and had dismissed 429 civil servants by November, when implementa-
 tion of the resolution was discontinued.
 The Royal Bhutan Police, assisted by the Royal Bhutan Army, including those as-
 signed to the Royal Body Guard, and a national militia, maintain internal security.
 Some members of these forces committed human rights abuses against ethnic Nepa-
 lese.
 The economy is based on agriculture and forestry, which provide the main liveli-
 hood for 90 percent of the population and account for about half of the gross domes-
 tic product. Agriculture consists largely of subsistence farming and animal hus-
 bandry. Cardamon, citrus fruit, and spices are the leading agricultural exports. Ce-
 ment and electricity are the other important exports. Strong trade and monetary
 ties link the economy closely to that of India. Hydroelectric power production poten-
 tial and tourism are key resources, although the Government limits foreign tourist
 arrivals for tourist infrastructure and environmental reasons by means of pricing
 policies. Bhutan is a poor country. The gross national product (GNP) per capita is
 estimated to be $470.
 The Government significantly restricts the rights of the Kingdom's citizens. The
 King exercises strong, active, and direct power over the Government. Citizens do not
 have the right to change their government. The Government discourages political
 parties, and none operates legally. Judges serve at the King's pleasure. Criminal
 cases and a variety of civil matters are adjudicated under a legal code established
 in the 17th century and revised and modernized in 1958 and 1965. In late 1998,
 the Government formed a special committee of jurists and government officials to
 review the country's basic law and propose changes. Programs to build a body of
 written law and to train lawyers are progressing. For example, the Government has
 recently sent 15 to 20 students to India and other countries for legal training. The
 Government restricts freedom of speech, of the press, of assembly, and of associa-
 tion. It also restricts worker rights. Citizens face significant limitations to their
 rights to a fair trial, freedom of religion, and privacy. Private television reception
 has been banned since 1989. In July the Government initiated steps to renew nego-
 tiations with the Government of Nepal on procedures for the screening and repatri-
 ation of ethnic Nepalese in the refugee camps, and the two governments held a se-
 ries of meetings during the second half of the year. Amnesty International also sent
 a delegation to the country in November. The Government claims that it has pros-
 ecuted government personnel for unspecified abuses committed in the early 1990's;
 however, public indications are that it has done little to investigate and prosecute
 security force officials responsible for torture, rape, and other abuses committed
 against ethnic Nepalese residents.

 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Feedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political or
 other extrajudicial killings in 1998. Human rights groups allege that Gomchen
 Karma, a Buddhist monk arrested in October 1997 during a peaceful demonstration
 in eastern Bhutan, was shot and killed by a government official. The Government
 states that the shooting was accidentl, that the official responsible has-been sus-
 pended from duty and charged in connection with the incident, and that his case
 was being heard at year's end.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 There were no confirmed reports of torture during the year. According to the Center
 for the Treatment of Victims of Torture, numerous ethnic Nepalese refugees at-
 tempting to return to Bhutan were captured by security forces, tortured, and sent
 back across the border. Instances of torture of ethnic Nepalese who attempted to
 return to Bhutan occurred in 1996. There were no such cases in 1998.
 Refugee groups credibly claim that persons detained as suspected dissidents in
 the early 1990's were tortured by security forces, who also committed acts of rape.
 During those years, the Government's ethnic policies and the crackdown on ethnic
 Nepalese political agitation created a climate of impunity in which the Government
 tacitly condoned the physical abuse of ethnic Nepalese. The Government denies
 these abuses but also claims it has investigated and prosecuted three government
 officials for unspecified abuses of authority during that period. Details of these cases
 have not been made public, and there is little indication that the Government has
 adequately investigated or punished any security force officials involved in the wide-
 spread abuses of 1989-92. Human rights groups allege that a Buddhist monk ar-
 rested in October 1997, Thinley Oezor Kenpo, was tortured in custody in 1997.
 Prison conditions are reportedly adequate, if austere. In 1993 the International
 Committee of-the Red Cross began a program of visits to prisons in the capital,
 Thimphu. In 1994 a new prison in Chemgang was opened. Together, these events
 contributed to a substantial improvement in conditions of detention over those that
 existed until a few years ago. Bhutanese human rights groups active outside the
 country maintain that prison conditions outside of Thimphu remain oppressive.
 The Government and the ICRC signed a new Memorandum of Understanding in
 September, extending the ICRC prison visits-program for another 5 years. During
 the same month, an ICRC-team visited 54 inmates in Chemgang central jail and
 127 inmates in Thimphu district jail.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Under the Police Act of 1979, police may
 not arrest a person without a warrant and must produce an arrested person before
 a court within 24 hours of arrest, exclusive of travel time from place of arrest. Legal
 protections are incomplete, however, due to the lack of a fully elaborated criminal
 procedure code and to deficiencies in police training and practice. Arbitrary arrest
 and detention remain a problem. Incommunicado detention is known to occur. In-
 communicado detention of suspected militants was a serious problem in 1991 and
 1992, but the initiation of ICRC prison visits and the establishment of an ICRC mail
 service between detainees and family members has helped to allay this problem. Of
 those detained in connection with political dissidence and violence in southern Bhu-
 tan in 1991-92, 1,685 were ultimately amnestied, 58 are serving sentences after
 conviction by the High Court, 9 were acquitted by the High Court, and 71 were re-
 leased after serving prison sentences.
 Four persons were arrested in February 1997 in Trashi and charged with involve-
 ment in seditious activities. They were convicted by the High Court and are cur-
 rently serving prison sentences. Human rights groups allege that in July and Au-
 gust 1997, the Royal Bhutan Police (RBP), in and around Samdrup Jongkar town
 in the east arrested some 50 suspected supporters of a Bhutanese dissident group
 active outside the country. The Government states that only 16 persons were ar-
 rested during this period and that they have been charged with involvement in sedi-
 tious activities and are awaiting trial -Many were said to be supporters of one-time
 Druk National Congress (DNC) and United Front for Democracy in Bhutan (UFD)
 leader Rongthong Kunley Doiji, who was arrested in India on April 18 following the
 issuance of an extradition request by Bhutanese authorities. Doiji face& extradition
 proceedings in India and possible return to Bhutan to face charges of fraud, non-
 payment of loans, and incitement to violence. The original Bhutanese extradition re-
 quest included a third charge, "anti-national activities," but this was later dropped
 when it became-clear that Indian law would preclude his extradition to face political
 charges. Human rights groups contend that the charges brought against Doiji are
 politically motivated and constitute an attempt by the government to suppress his
 
 
 1879
 
 prodemocracy activities. In June an Indian court granted Doiji bail, but placed re-
 strictions on his movements.
 Amnesty International (AI) reported that some of those arrested are feared to be
 at risk of torture. Bhutanese human rights groups outside the country claim that
 the arrests, including those of several Buddhist monks, are aimed at imposing
 Ngalong norms on the eastern, Sharchop community, which has a distinct ethnic
 and religious identity. The Government denies that it has such a policy; many gov-
 ernment officials, including the current Head of Government, Foreign Minister
 Jigme Thinley, and the Chief Justice of the High Court, are Sharchops.
 Human rights activists allege that police arrested as many as 50 persons partici-
 pating in a peaceful demonstration in eastern Bhutan in October 1997. The Govern-
 ment acknowledged that 58 persons whom it described as "terrorists" were serving
 sentences at year's end for crimes including rape, murder, and robbery. It stated
 that a total of 134 persons were arrested in connection with the October 1997 dis-
 turbances in eastern Bhutan; of that number, more than one-half either had been
 tried and acquitted or had been released after serving short sentences.
 Although the Government does not formally use exile as a form of punishment,
 many accused political dissidents freed under Government amnesties say that they
 were released on the condition that they depart the country. Many of them subse-
 quently registered at refugee camps in Nepal. The Government denies this.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-There is no written constitution, and the judiciary
 is not independent of the King.
 The judicial system consists of district courts and a High Court in Thimphu.
 Judges are appointed by the King on the recommendation of the Chief Justice and
 may be removed by him. Village headmen adjudicate minor offenses and adminis-
 trative matters.
 Criminal cases and a variety of civil matters are adjudicated under a legal code
 established in the 17th century and revised in 1965. For offenses against the State,
 state-appointed prosecutors ifie charges and prosecute cases. In other cases, the rel-
 evant orgamizations and departments of government file charges and conduct the
 prosecution. Defendants are supposed to be presented with written charges in lan-
 guages that they understand and given time to prepare their own defense. This
 practice, however, is not always followed, according to some political dissidents. In
 cases where defendants cannot write their own defense, courts assign judicial offi-
 cers to assist defendants. A legal education program is gradually building a body
 of persons who have received formal training in the law abroad. Village headmen,
 who have the power to arbitrate disputes, make up the bottom rung of the judicial
 system. Magistrates can review their decisions, each with responsibility for a block
 of villages. Magistrates' decisions can be appealed to district judges, of which there
 is one for each of the country's 20 districts. The High Court in Thimphu is the coun-
 try's supreme court. Its decisions can be appealed to the King.
 Defendants have the right to appeal to the High Court and may make a final ap-
 peal to the King, who traditionally delegates the decision to the Royal Advisory
 Council. Trials are to be conducted in open hearings; however, there are allegations
 that this is not always the case in practice.
 Questions of family law, such as marriage, divorce, and adoption, are traditionally
 resolved according to a citizen's religion: Buddhist tradition for the majority of the
 population and Hindu tradition for the ethnic Nepalese; however, the Government
 states that there is one formal law that governs these matters.
 Some or all of the approximately 75 prisoners serving sentences for offenses relat-
 ed to political dissidence or violence, primarily by ethnic Nepalese during 1991-92,
 may be political prisoners.
 Tek Nath Rizal, an ethnic Nepalese and internationally recognized political pris-
 oner, remained in prison. Tek Nath Rizal was arrested in 1988 in Nepal-and extra-
 dited to Bhutan, where he was held in solitary confinement in Wangdiphodrang
 military prison until his 1992 conviction for "anti-national" crimes, including writing
 and distributing political pamphlets and attending political meetings. His conviction
 cited the 1993 National Security Act, although it had not yet been passed. A United
 Nations Human Rights Commission Working Group on Arbitrary Detention that vis-
 ited Bhutan in 1994 at the Government's invitation determined that Rizal had re-
 ceived a fair trial and declared his detention "not to be arbitrary."
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-There
 are no laws providing for these rights. The Government requires all citizens, includ-
 ing minorities, to wear the traditional dress of the Buddhist majority when visiting
 Buddhist religious buildings, monasteries, government offices, and in schools and
 when attending official functions and public ceremonies. According to human rights
 groups police regularly conduct house-to-house searches for suspected dissidents
 without explanation or legal justification.
 
 
 1880
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Government restricts freedom of speech
 and of the press. The country's only regular publication is Kuensel, a government-
 run weekly newspaper with a circulation of 10,000. Bhutanese human rights groups
 state that government ministries regularly review editorial material and have the
 power to, and regularly do, suppress or change content. They allege that the board
 of directors nominally responsible for editorial policy is appointed by and can be re-
 moved by the Government. Kuensel, which publishes simultaneous editions in the
 English, Dzongkha, and Nepali languages, supports the Government but does occa-
 sionally report criticism of the King and Government policies in the National As-
 sembly. Indian and other foreign newspapers are available.
 The Government bans all private television reception in the country. Since 1989
 all television antennas and satellite receiving dishes have been ordered dismantled.
 The Government radio station broadcasts each day in the four major languages
 (Dzongkha, Nepali, English, and Sharchop).
 English is the medium   of instruction in schools and the national language,
 Dzongkha, is taught as second language. The teaching of Nepali as a second lan-
 guage was discontinued in 1990.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Government restricts free-
 dom of assembly and association. Citizens may engage in peaceful assembly and as-
 sociation only for purposes approved by the Government. Although the Government
 allows civic and business organizations, there are no legal political parties. The Gov-
 ernment regards parties organized by ethnic Nepalese exiles-the Bhutan People's
 Party (BPP) and the Bhutan National Democratic Party (BNDP)-as well as the
 Druk National Congress (DNC)-as "terrorist and anti-national" organizations and
 has declared them illegal. These parties do not conduct activities inside the country.
 They seek the repatriation of refugees and democratic reform.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-Buddhism is the state religion. The Government sub-
 sidizes monasteries and shrines and provides aid to about a third of the Kingdom's
 12,000 monks. That part of the monastic establishment following the school of Bud-
 dhism practiced by. the western Ngalong ethnic group enjoys statutory representa-
 tion in the National Assembly and in the Royal Advisory Council and is an influen-
 tial voice on public policy. Citizens of other faiths, mostly Hindus, enjoy freedom of
 worship but may not proselytize. Under the law, conversions are illegal.
 The King has declared major Hindu festivals to be national holidays, and the
 royal family participates in them. Foreign missionaries are not permitted to pros-
 elytize, but international Christian relief organizations and Jesuit priests are active
 in education and humanitarian activities.
 d. Fieedom of Movement. Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-Citizens traveling in border regions are required to show their citizen-
 ship identity cards at immigration check points, which in some cases are located at
 a considerable distance from what is in effect an open border with India. By treaty,
 citizens may reside and work in India.
 Bhutan is not a signatory to the 1951 U.N. Convention Relating to the Status of
 Refugees or its 1967 Protocol. See Section 5 regarding the-ethnic Nepalese refugee
 situation.
 The Government states that it recognizes the right to asylum in accordance with
 international refugee law; however, it has no official policy regarding refugees, asy-
 lum, first asylum, or the return of refugees to countries in which they fear persecu-
 tion.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens do not have the right to change their government. Bhutan is a .monarchy
 with sovereign power-vested in the King. However, there are elected or partially
 elected assemblies at the local, district, and national levels, and.the Government
 purports to encourage decentralization and citizen participation. Since 1969, the Na-
 tional Assembly has had the- power to remove ministers, who are appointed by the
 King, but it has never done so. Political authority resides ultimately in the King
 and decisionmaking involves only a small number of officials. Major decisions are
 routinely made by officials subject to questioning by the National Assembly, but the
 National Assembly is not known to have overturned any decisions reached by the
 King and government officials. In June the King introduced term limits for his
 Council of Ministers and proposed measures to increase the role of the National As-
 sembly in the formation of his Government. The National Assembly elected a new
 Council of Ministers and Government in July to a 5-year term.
 
 
 1881
 
 Political parties do not legally exist, and their formation is discouraged by the
 Government as unnecessarily divisive. The Government prohibits parties estab-
 lished abroad by ethnic Nepalese (see Section 2.b.).
 The National Assembly, established in 1953, has 150 members. Of these, 105 are
 elected by the people, 10 are selected by a part of the Buddhist clergy, and the re-
 maining 35 are appointed by the King to represent the Government.
 The procedures for the nomination and election of National Assembly members
 are set out in an amendment to the country's Basic Law proposed by the King and
 adopted by the 73rd session of the National Assembly in 1995. It provides that in
 order to be eligible for nomination as a candidate for election to the National Assem-
 bly, a person must be a citizen of Bhutan, be at least 25 years of age, not be married
 to a foreign national, not have been terminated or compulsorily retired for mis-
 conduct from government service, not have committed any act of treason against the
 King, the people, and country, have no criminal record or any criminal case pending
 against him, have respect for the nation's laws, and be able to read and write in
 Dzongkha (the language, having different dialects in eastern and western Bhutan,
 spoken by Bhutanese Buddhists).
 Each National Assembly constituency consists of a number of villages. Each vil-
 lage is permitted to nominate one candidate but must do so by consensus. There
 is no provision for self-nomination and the law states that "no person. . . may cam-
 paign for the candidacy or canvass through other means." If more than one village
 within a constituency puts forward a candidate, an election is conducted by the dis-
 trict development committee, and the candidate obtaining a simple majority of votes
 cast is declared the winner. Individuals do not have the right to vote. Every family
 in a village is entitled to one vote in elections. The law does not make clear how
 a candidate is selected if none achieves a simple majority. It does state, however,
 that in case of a tie among the candidates in the election, drawing of lots shall be
 resorted to. The candidate whose name is drawn shall be deemed to be elected.
 Bhutanese human rights activists claim that the only time individual citizens
 have any involvement in choosing a National Assembly representative is when they
 are asked for their consensus aproval of a village candidate by the village head-
 man. The name put to villagers or consensus approval by the headman is suggested
 to him by district officials, who in turn take their direction from the central Govern-
 ment. Consensus approval takes place at a public gathering. There is no secret bal-
 lot, according to human rights activists.
 The Assembly enacts laws, approves senior Government appointments, and ad-
 vises the King on matters of national importance. Voting is by secret ballot, with
 a simple majority needed to pass a measure. The King may not formally veto legis-
 lation, but may return bills for further consideration. The Assembly occasionally re-
 jects the King's recommendations or delays implementing them, but in general, the
 King has enough influence to persuade the Assembly to approve legislation that he
 considers essential or to withw proposals he opposes. The Assembly may ques-
 tion government officials and force them to resign by a two-thirds vote of no con-
 fidence. The National Assembly has never compelled any government official to re-
 sign. The Royal Civil Service Commission is responsible for disciplining subministe-
 rial level government officials and has removed several following their convictions
 for crimes including embezzlement
 In June, the King issued a decree setting out several measures intended to in-
 crease the role of the National Assembly in the formation and dissolution of his Gov-
 ernment. The decree, later adopted by the 76th session of the National Assembly,
 provided that all cabinet ministers are to be elected by the National Assembly and
 that the roles and responsibilities of the cabinet ministries were to be spelled out.
 Each cabinet minister is to be elected by simple majority in a secret ballot in the
 National Assembly from among candidates nominated by the King. The King is to
 select nominees for Cabinet office from among senior government officials holding
 the rank of secretary or above. The King is to award the portfolios of his ministers,
 whose terms will be limited to 5 years, after which they must pass a vote of con-
 fidence in the National Assembly in order to remain in office. Finally, the decree
 provided that the National Assembly, by a two-thirds vote of no confidence, can re-
 quire the King to abdicate and to be replaced by the next in the line of succession.
 After adopting the decree, the National Assembly elected a new Cabinet of Ministers
 consistent with the decree. Human rights groups maintain that since only the King
 may nominate candidates for cabinet office, their election by the National Assembly
 is not a significant democratic reform.
 Women are underrepresented in government and politics, although they have
 made small but visible gains. Three women hold seats in the National Assembly.
 All major ethnic groups, including ethnic Nepalese, are represented in the Na-
 tional Assembly. There are 16 "southern Bhutanese" in the National Assembly.
 
 
 1882
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongbvernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 There are no legal human rights nongovernmental organizations (NGO's) in Bhu-
 tan. The Government regards human rights groups established by ethnic Nepalese
 exiles-the Human Rights Organization of Bhutan, the People's Forum for Human
 Rights in Bhutan, and the Association of Human Rights Actvists-Bhutan-as po-
 litical organizations and does not permit them to operate in Bhutan. Amnesty Inter-
 national (AI) visited Bhutan in 1992 to investigate and to report on the alleged
 abuse of ethnic Nepalese. In late November, AI again sent a delegation to the coun-
 try, by year's end; it had not published a report on the visit.
 I ICR representatives continue their periodic prison visits, and the Government
 has allowed them access to detention facilities, including those in southern districts
 inhabited by ethnic Nepalese. The chairman and members of the United Nations
 Human Rights Commission Working Group 'on Arbitrary Detention made a second
 visit to Bhutan in May 1996 as a follow-up to an October 1994 visit. In addition
 to meetings with government officials, members of the working group visited prisons
 and interviewed prisoners in Thimphu, Phuntsoling, and Saitse.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 Ongoing government efforts to cultivate a national identity rooted in the lan-
 guage, religion, and culture of the Ngalong ethnic group constrain cultural expres-
 sion by other ethnic groups. In the 1980's and early 1990's, concern over rapid popu-
 lation growth and political agitation by ethnic Nepalese resulted in policies and a u-
 sive practices that'led to the departure of tens of thousands of ethnic Nepalese,
 many of whom were forcibly expelled.
 The Government claims that ethnic and gender discrimination in employment is
 not a problem. It claims that ethnic Nepalese fill 22 percent of government jobs,
 which is slightly less than their proportion of the total population. Bhutanese
 human rights groups active outside the country claim that ethnic Nepalese actually
 make up about 35 percent of Bhutan's population and that the Government under-
 reports their number. Women are accorded respect in the traditions of most ethnic
 groups; however, persistence of traditional gender roles apparently accounts for the
 low proporion of women in government employment. Exile groups claim that ethnic
 and gender discrimination is a problem.
 Women.-There is no evidence that rape or spousal abuse are extensive problems.
 Kuensel reported that charges of rape or attempted rape were brought in at least
 one case. However, a conviction and sentence were not reported.
 There are credible reports by refugees and human rights groups that security
 forces raped large numbers of ethnic Nepalese women in southern Bhutan in 1991
 and 1992. According to Amnesty International, some women were said to have died
 as a result. In one independent survey of 1,779 refugee families, 26 percent of the
 respondents cited rape, fear of rape, or threat of rape as a prime reason for their
 departure from Bhutan. The Government has denied these reports.
 ape was made a criminal offense in 1953, but that law had weak penalties and
 was enforced poorly. In 1993 the National Assembly adopted a revised rape act with
 clear definitions of criminal sexual assault and stronger penalties. In cases of rape
 involving minors, sentences range from 5 to 17 years. In extreme cases, a rapist
 may be imprisoned for life:"   ...
 Women comprise 48 percent of the population and participate freely in the social
 and economic lif of the country. Foiy-three percent of enrollment in school is fe-
 male, and 16 percent of civil service employees are women. Inheritance law provides
 for equal' inheritance among all sons and daughters, but traditional inheritance
 practices, which vary among ethnic groups, may be observed if the heirs choose to
 forego legal challenges. Dowry is not practiced, even among ethnic Nepalese Hindus.
 Among some groups, inheritance practices favoring daughters are said to account
 for the large numbers of women among owners of shops and businesses and for an
 accompanying tendency of women to drop out of higher education to go into busi-
 ness. However, female school enrollment has been growing in response to govern-
 ment policies. Women are increasingly found among senior officials and private sec-
 tor entrepreneurs, especially in the tourism industry. Women in unskilled -jobs are
 generally paid slightly less than men:
 Polygyny is sanctioned provided the first wife gives her permission. Marriages
 may be arranged by partners themselves as well as by their parents. Divorce is com-
 mon. Recent legislation requires -that all marriages must be registered and favors
 women in -matters of alimony.
 Children.-The Government has demonstrated its-commitment to child welfare  by
 its rapid expansion of primary schools, health-care facilities, and immunization pro-
 
 
 1883
 
 grams. The mortality rates for both infants and children under 5 years have
 dropped dramatically since 1989, and primary school enrollment has increased at
 9 percent per year since 1991, with enrollment of girls increasing at a yet higher
 rate. In 1995 the participation rate for boys and girls in primary schools was esti-
 mated at 72 percent, with the rate of completion of 7 years of schooling at 60 per-
 cent for girls and at 59 percent for boys. Children enjoy a privileged position in soci-
 ety and benefit from international development programs focused on maternal and
 child welfare.
 A study by UNICEF found that boys and girls Teceive equal treatment regarding
 nutrition and health care and that there is little difference in child mortality rates
 between the sexes. Government policies aimed at increasing enrollment of girls have
 increased the proportion of girls in primary schools from 39 percent in 1990 to 43
 percent in 1995.
 There is no societal pattern of abuse against children.
 People With Disabilities.-There is no evidence of official discrimination toward
 people with disabilities but the Government has not passed legislation mandating
 accessibility for the disabled.
 National/RaciallEthnic Minorities.-Ethnic Nepalese have lived in southern
 Bhutan for centuries, and the early phases of economic development at the turn of
 the century brought a large influx of additional ethnic Nepalese. In the late 1980's,
 concern over the increase in the population and political agitation among ethnic
 -Nepalese-prompted aggressive government efforts to assert a national culture, to
 tighten control over southern regions, to control illegal immigration, to expel ethnic
 Nepalese, and to promote national integration. Early efforts at national integration
 focused on assimilation, including financial incentives for intermarriage, education
 for some students in regions other than their own, and an increase in development
 funds in the south.
 Beginning in 1989, more discriminatory measures were introduced, aimed at
 shaping a new national identity, known as Drukpa. Drkpa is based on the customs
 of the non-Nepalese Ngalong ethnic group predominant in western Bhutan. Meas-
 ures included a-requirement' that national dress be worn for official occasions and
 as a school uniform, the teaching ofDzongkha as a second language in all schools,
 and an end to instruction in Nepali as a second language (English is the language
 of instruction in all schools). Also, beginning in 1988, the Government refused to
 renew the contracts of tens of thousands of Nepaese guest workers. Many of these
 workers had resided in Bhutan for years, in some cases with their families.
 Citizenship became a highly contentious issue. Requirements for citizenship were
 first formalized in the Citizenship Law of 1958, which granted citizenship to all
 adults who owned land and had lived in Bhutan for at least 10 years. In 1985, how-
 ever, a new citizenship law significantly tightened requirements for citizenship and
 resulted in the denaturalization of many ethnic Nepalese. While previously citizen-
 ship was conferred upon children whose father was a citizen under the 1958 law,
 ,the 1985 law required that both -parents be citizens in order to confer citizenship
 on a child. The law permits residents who lost citizenship under the -1985 law to
 a pply for naturalization if they can prove-residence during the previous 15 years.
 _The Government declared all-residents wha could-not meet the new requirements
 to be illegal immigrants.
 The 1985 Citizenship Act also provides for the revocation of the citizenship of any
 naturalized citizen who "has shown by act or speech to be disloyal in any manner
 whatsoever to the King, country, and people of Bhutan." The Home Ministry, in a
 circular notification in 1990, advised that "any Bhutanese nationals leaving the
 country to assist and help the anti-nationals shall no longer be considered as Bhuta-
 nese citizens . . . such people's family members living in the same household will
 also be held fully responsible and forfeit their citizenship." Human rights groups al-
 lege that these provisions were widely used to revoke the citizenship of ethnic Nepa-
 lese who were subsequently expelled or otherwise departed from Bhutan. Beginning
 in 1988, the Government. expelled large numbers of ethnic Nepalese through en-
 forcement of the citizenship laws.
 Outraged by what they saw as a campaign of repression, ethnic Nepalese mounted
 a series of demonstrations,-sometimes violent, in September 1990. The protests were
 spearheaded by the newly formed Bhutan People's Party (BPP) which demanded full
 citizenship rights for ethnic Nepalese, the reintroduction of Nepali as a medium of
 education in the south, -and democratic reforms. Characterizing the BPP as a "ter-
 rorist" movement backed by Indian sympathizers, the authorities cracked down on
 -its activities-and ordered the closure of local Nepalese schools,- clinics, and develop-
 ment programs after several were raided or bombed by dissidents. Many Nepalese
 schools were-reportedly turned into Army barracks. There were credible reports that
 many ethnic Nepalese activists were beaten and tortured while in custody, and that
 
 
 1884
 
 security forces committed acts of rape. There were also credible reports-that mili-
 tants, including BPP members, attacked and murdered census officers and other of-
 ficials, and engaged in~bombings. Local officials took advantage of the climate of re-
 pression to coerce ethnic Nepalese to sell their land below its fair value6 and to emi-
 grate.               I-                                              ,
 Begini    in 1991, ethnic Nepalese began to leave southern Bhutan in large num-
 bers and take refuge in Nepal. Many were forcibly expelled. According to Amnesty
 International, entire villages were sometimes evicted en masse in retaliation for an
 attack on a local government official. Many ethnic Nepalese were forced to sign "vol-
 untary migration forms" wherein they agreed to leave Bhutan, after local officials
 threatened to fine or imprison them for failing to comply. By August 1991, according
 to NGO reports, 2,500 refugees were already camped illegally in Nepal, with a
 steady stream still coming from Bhutan. The UNCR began providing food and
 shelter in September of that-year, and-by year's end, there were 6,000 refugees in
 Nepal. The number of registered refugees grew to approximately 62,000 by August
 1992, and to approximately 80,000 by June 1993,  when the UNHCR began individ-
 ual screening of refugees. The flow slowed considerably thereafter; there were no
 new refugee arrivals from -Bhutan to the camps during the year. At the close of
 1997, there were approximately 91,000 refugees registered in camps in Nepal, with
 much of the increase since 1993 the result of births to residents of the camps., An
 additional 15,000 refugees, according to UNHCR estimates,-are living outside the
 camps in Nepal and India.   I  I             _
 Ethnic Nepalese political groups in exile complain that the revision of Bhutan's
 citizenship laws in 1985 denaturalized tens of thousands of former residents of Bhu-
 tan. They also complain that the new laws have been selectively applied and-make
 unfair demands for documentation on a largely illiterate group in a country that has
 only recently adopted basic administrative procedures. They claim that many ethnic
 Nepalese whose families have been in Bhutan for generations were expelled in the
 early 1990's because they were unable  to document their claims to residence. The
 Government denies this and asserts that a three-member village committee-typi-
 cally ethnic. Nepalese in southern Bhutan--certifles in writing that a resident is a
 Bhutanese citizen in cases where documents_ can'not be produced.
 The Government maintains that many of those who departed Bhutan in 1991-92
 were Nepalese or Indian citizens who came to Bhutan after the enactment of the
 1958 Citizenship law but were not detected until a census in 1988. The Government
 also claims that many persons xegistered in the camps as refugees -may never have
 resided in Bhutan. A royal decree in 1991 made forcible expulsion of a citizen a
 criminal offense. In a January 1992 edict, the King noted reports that officials had
 been forcing Bhutanese nationals to leave the country but stressed-that this was-
 a serious and punishable violation of law. Nevertheless, only three officials were
 ever punished for abusing their authority during this period. According to the
 UNHCR, the overwhelming majority of refugees who have entered the camps since
 screening, began .in. June 1993 have documentary proof of Bhutanese nationality.
 Random checks and surveys of camp residents-icluding both pre- and post-June
 1993 arrivals--bear this out.
 A Nepal-Bhutan ministerial committee met seven times between 1994-96,, and a
 secretarial-level committee met twice in 1997 in efforts to resolve the Bhutanese ref-
 ugee problem. During the year, Foreign Minister Jigme Y. Thinley took office with
 a mandate to resolve the refugee issue, and several meetings were held with rep-
 resentatives of the Nepalese Government, the UNHCR and NGO's. However, there
 were no reports of the results of these meetings by year's end. In March 1996 refu-
 gees began a series -of "peace marches" from Nepal to Bhutan to assert their right
 to return.to Bhutan. The marchers who crossed into Bhutan in August; November,
 and December 1996 were immediately detained and deported by Bhutanese police.
 In the December 1996 incident, police reportedly used force against the marchers.
 Peace marches were also held in 1993. A resolution adopted by the National Assem-
 bly in July 1997 prohibits the still-resident family members of ethnic Nepalese refu-
 gees from holding jobs with the Government or in the armed forces. Under the teso-'
 lution, those holding such jobs were to be involuntarily retired. -The Government
 made clear that for the purposes of this resolution, family member would be defimed
 as a parent, a child, a sibling, or a member of the stame household. The Government
 states that 429 civil servants, many of them    ethnic Nepalese, were retired
 compulsorily in accordance with the -July 1997 National Assembly resolution, and
 that the program was terminated in November. The Government states that those
 forced to retire were accorded retirement benefits in propoition to their years of gov-
 ernment service. The Government also began a program of resettling Buddhist Bhu-
 tanese, from other regions of the country on land in southern Bhutan vacated by the
 ethnic Nepalese now living in refugee camps in Nepal. Human rights groups main-
 
 
 1885
 
 tain that this action prejudices any eventual outcome of negotiations over the return
 of the refugees to Bhutan. The Government maintains that this is not its first reset-
 tlement program and that Bhutanese citizens who are ethnic Nepalese from the
 south are sometimes resettled on more fertile land in other parts of Bhutan.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Trade unions are not permitted, and there are no
 labor unions. Workers do not have the right to strike, and the Government is not
 a member of the International Labor Organization.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-There is no collective bargain-
 ing in industry. Industry accounts for about 25 percent of the gross domestic prod-
 uct, but employs only a minute fraction of the total work force. The Government af-
 fects wages in the manufacturing sector through its control over wages in state-
 owned industries.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Government abolished its sys-
 tem of compulsory labor taxes in December 1995. Laborers in rural development
 schemes previously paid through this system will now be paid regular wages. There
 is no evidence to suggest that domestic workers are-subjected to coerced or bonded
 labor. The law does not specifically prohibit forced and bonded labor by children,
 but such practices are not known to occur.
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment.-The law
 sets the minimum age for employment at 18 years for citizens and 20 years for non-
 citizens. A UNICEF study suggested that children as young as 11 years are some-
 times employed with road-building teams. The law does not specifically prohibit
 forced and bonded labor by children, but such practices are not known to occur (see
 Section 6.c.). The Government provides free and compulsory primary school edu-
 cation, and 72 percent of the school-aged population is enrolled. Children often do
 agricultural work and dhores on family farms. There is no law barring ethnic Nepa-
 lese children from attending school. However, most of the 75 primary schools in
 southern Bhutan that were closed in 1990 remain closed today. The closure of the
 schools acts as an effective barrier to the ability of the ethnic Nepalese in southern
 Bhutan to obtain a primary education.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-A circular effective February 1, 1994, estab-
 lished wage rates, rules and regulations for labor recruiting agencies, and regula-
 tions for payment of workmen's compensation. Wage rates are periodically revised,
 and range upward from a minimum of roughly $1.50 (50 ngultrums) per day for un-
 skilled and skilled laborers, with various allowances paid in cash or kind in addi-
 tion. This minimum wage does provide a decent standard of living for a worker and
 family in the local context. The workday is defined as 8 hours, with a 1-hour lunch
 break. Work in excess of this 'Must be paid at one and one-half times normal rates.
 Workers paid on a monthly basis are entitled to 1 day's- paid leave for 6 days of
 work and 15 days of leave annually. The largest salaried work force is the govern-
 ment service, which has an administered wage structure last revised in 1988 but
 supplemented by special allowances and increases since then, including a 25 percent
 increase in July 1997. Only about 30 industrial plants employ more than 50 work-
 ers. Smaller industrial, units include 69 plants of medium siVe, 197 small units, 692
 "mini" units, and 651 cottage industry units. The Government favors a family-owned
 farm policy;, this, along with Bhutan's rugged geography and land laws that prohibit
 a farmer from selling his last five acres result in a predominantly self-employed ag-
 ricultural work force. Workers are entitled to free medical care within the country.
 They are eligible for compensation for partial or total disability, and in the event
 of death, their families are entitled to compensation. Existing labor regulations do
 not grant workers the right to remove themselves from work situations that endan-
 ger health and safety without jeopardizing their continued employment.
