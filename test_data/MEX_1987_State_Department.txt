 MEXICO
 Mexico is a Federal Republic which has been dominated by the
 Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) since the party's
 founding in 1929. Periodic political reform has expanded the
 opposition's role and stake in the political system;
 nevertheless, the PRI has maintained its preponderant
 political control throughout the Republic by a combination of
 voting strength, organizational power, and, as some opposition
 parties and observers allege, electoral fraud.
 Mexico has a mixed economy, combining elements of domestic
 market capitalism with state ownership of major industries
 (parastatals). Through a program of divestiture of some
 uneconomic parastatals, the Government is increasing the role
 of the private sector in the economy.
 The 1917 Constitution stipulates that power be divided among a
 bicameral legislature, a judiciary, and an executive. In
 Mexico's highly centralized system, however, the President's
 powers far outweigh those of the other branches. Despite this
 centralization of authority, municipal, state, and federal
 police do exercise significant authority in their respective
 areas of jurisdiction.
 A high degree of individual freedom, regardless of race,
 creed, color, or sex, is provided for by the Constitution and
 honored in practice. Freedom of association is demonstrated
 by the existence of numerous political parties as well as
 civic associations. Freedom to pursue private interests and
 hold private property is virtually unrestricted for Mexican
 citizens.
 Mexico is currently experiencing human rights difficulties
 principally, but not exclusively, in those areas of law
 enforcement involved with drug trafficking. In addition, the
 perennial rural conflicts over title to land continue to
 result in the deaths of peasants who confront local landowners
 and their employees.  Abuse of prisoners continues; 91 U.S.
 citizens reported physical mistreatment by prison authorities.
 Human rights abuses persist in a number of areas, and, although
 the Government states that it has taken steps to improve
 respect for human rights, Amnesty International has continued
 to express concern about mistreatment and torture of prisoners.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 In Mexico's rural states, especially Oaxaca, Chiapas, Veracruz,
 Hidalgo, and Gu~rrero, disputes over land title continue to
 take place, and violence sometimes occurs. The Federal
 Government is continuing its efforts to curb such violence.
 Attorneys general from the various states meet frequently with
 national law enforcement and secretariat of government
 officials to pursue this goal, but violations continue
 nonetheless. Paramilitary bands and police controlled by
 local political bosses (caciques) and landowners are often
 accused of oppressing and even murdering peasant activists.
 Peasant organizations charge that at least 123 peasants were
 killed in confrontations in the first 7 months of 1987.
 Similar charges have come not only from independent peasant
 organizations, but also from the PRI-affiliated National
 
 
 541
 -MEXICO
 Confederation of Peasants (CNC). The independent groups
 attribute the killings, to persons'employed by local landed
 political bosses, as well as to members of the CNC and to the
 local police. For its part, the CNC blames fatalities in its
 ranks-on fndependent'unions encouraged, it says, by leftist
 political activists. Others, however, suggest that most CNC
 casualties stem from internal CNC power struggles.
 Rafael Caro Quintero, Erriesto Fonseca Carrillo, and'more than
 60 other individuals accused of involvement in the kidnaping
 and murder of U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) agent Enrique
 Camarena remain in jail as Mexican state and federal courts
 consider the cases against these suspects. Progress in these
 trials has been slowed by the submission of procedural appeals
 which -ust be adjudicated prior to the other proceedings. In
 the interim, iniestigatiVe work continues into a possible
 relationship b.tween Camarena's murder and the 1984
 disappearance,6f five U.S. citizens and a legal permanent
 resident, thought to have been mistaken by Caro Quintero
 associates. for DEA agents.
 b. Disappearance
 According toothe Committee in Defense of Prisoners, the
 Persecutbd,.Disappeared Persons snd Political Exiles of
 Mexico, a Mexican-human rights organization, their records
 show a 'totbl of 543 disappeared persons in Mexico. The
 Committee claims that during the-administration of President
 Miguel de.la Madrid,. th-ere have-been 24 disappearances of
 persons whose whereabouts' remain unknown, with 3 having
 allegedly disappeared in 1987. The three known incidents
 are: Gabriel Fernando Valles Martinez, a judicial'police
 commander who disappeared in Durango in February; Juan Ramon
 Vasquez, a. peasant leader who disappeared in rural Oaxaca in
 May; and Antbnio Alcala Alba, a union leader and professor who
 disapptdred ih Mexico City in June. Human rights activists
 accuse mili'tary .nd police authorities of. responsibility in
 two of the Three cases of disappeared persons which have
 occurred this 'yar.
 c. Torture aiid other Cruel,-Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Torture is prohibited by the 6onstitution, -and according to a'
 July 1987 executive decree, Mexico intends to adhere to the
 Inter-American Convention for the Prevention of Torture, which
 bans the use of .torture by government.officials or police.
 Nevertifeless, human xights organiiations dontinue to charge
 that law enf&rcement officials employ psychological and
 physical apuse, ni'.t often in the period immediately following
 arrest and espedialiy duridg interrogation.:
 Six former Mexican police officials have been incarcerated in
 connection with the August 1986 torturing of DEA Agent Victor
 Cortez. A court in Guadalajara is now proceeding with its
 consideration, bf their case. One other former policeman
 chargQO-l tE .case has, thus far, eluded apprehension.
 The Attorney General of Mexico has stated that the use of
 torture to extract confessions is an illegal and unacceptable
 substitute for investigative work. Furthermore, the
 Administration continues to recruit new persohnel into the
 various police forces and is emphasizing education and
 training in legitimate investigative skills. In addition, the
 Attorney General's office has contracted with human rights
 
 
 542
 MEXICO
 organizations to provide courses designed to sensitize law
 enforcement personnel to the need to respect human rights.
 The use of torture and the subjection of prisoners to inhumane
 treatment is still reported. For example, the Sinaloa
 Federation of Lawyers charged in September that the Federal
 District Attorney's Office in Mazatlan maintains illegal
 detention and torture cells. The local commander of the
 Mexican Federal Judicial Police (MFJP) denied the use of
 torture but admitted that the MFJP maintained cells for the
 detention of dangerous suspects.
 Human rights activists and media accounts allege that in May
 two inmates of the San Luis Potosi State Prison were murdered
 by an assassination squad of inmates operating under orders of
 the prison administration. The two men had reportedly led
 protests against the prison authorities for embezzlement and
 brutality. In what is seen as a partial response to the San
 Luis Potosi incident, the Chamber of Deputies is considering
 establishment of a special subcommittee on human rights that
 would inspect Mexican prisons and propose reforms.
 Since publication of the last human rights report, the U.S.
 Embassy in Mexico City lodged formal diplomatic protests with
 the Mexican Government regarding 16 American citizens who
 alleged that they had been mistreated while in the custody of
 various Mexican law enforcement agencies. The Mexican
 Government has responded to only 2 protest cases, although
 officials claim to be investigating all 16 cases. In 75 other
 cases, American citizens reported that they had been
 physically mistreated by Mexican authorities but asked that
 the Embassy not protest.
 The U.S. Embassy has noted an increase in the incidence of
 mistreatment in the State of Sonora. In the first six months
 of 1987, 12 American citizens claimed that MFJP officers in
 the state had inflicted various forms of torture on them.
 Forms of mistreatment reported include forcing of soda water
 up the nose, electric shock to various parts of the body, and
 beatings. The Embassy strongly protested such treatment but
 has never received a satisfactory response from the Mexican
 Government. Apparently the MFJP has launched an internal
 investigation and several MFJP employees have been fired.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, Exile, or Forced Labor
 Mexican citizens have the right to seek restraining orders and
 to make appeals ("amparo"), a constitutional protection
 provided against "coercive and abusive acts of authority."
 Incidents of arbitrary arrest and imprisonment occur most
 frequently in criminal cases. In a recent reform of the
 restraining order/appeal system, certain categories of persons
 are automatically granted such petitions.
 Human rights activists report there are currently 150'
 political prisoners in the country, the majority of whom were
 arrested in disputes over land titles, and that some of these
 prisoners have been held for extended periods of time. In
 many such cases, especially those involving land tenure,
 persons termed political prisoners are, according to the
 Government, actually guilty of common crimes, such as
 terrorism, criminal association, and damage to property. The
 Government has consistently denied that it holds political
 prisoners.

 MEXICO
 Despite legal prohibitions against forcd or compulsory labor,
 there are reports that, in remote areas where illegal drugs
 are cultivated,.peasants and indigenous peoples have been
 forced to lab~r-for drug traffickers.
 e. Denial 9f Fair Public Trial
 Under the Cpnstitutioi, trial and sentencing must be completed
 within 12 mdnths'of arrest for crimes that would carry at
 least a 2-year sntence. Despite efforts td adhere to the
 constitutionaf_-quirements, this standard is often not met
 because of delays" caused by cumbersome court" procedures and
 -case backlogs.
 In September tePresident proposed to the Congress 30. reforms
 to the Federal ,Penal Code intended to broaden the rights of
 the accused. Among the most important reforms would be
 speedier trials and more careful examination of charges before
 formal ind~ctments are handed down.
 The political opposition complains ,that with judges serving in
 office under renewable appointments, the Judiciary is dependent
 on the executive branch." The Government denies that personal
 political beliefs hpye any bearing on the impartial
 administration of justi6e. However, factors such.as low pay
 for jddg4ja n, law enforcement officials and high caseloads
 contribut. to; the al:leged crruption in the judicial system.
 Trial i2 5by*judg, not jury, in nearly all criminal cases.
 Defendants fiave7a right to counsel, and public defenders are
 available.
 f. Arbitrary Interfereiide with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Cbrxespondehce
 Article 16-of t1ie Constitution provides for the privacy of
 individuals. Although the Government generally does not
 intrude on this right and search warrants are required by law,
 opposition political figures believe their movements are
 monitored. IjK cQnflicts over land titles, peasants and urban
 squatterA have charged that local landowners, accompanied by
 police;have entered theik homes without appropriate judicial
 orders, dnd that these incidents are sometimes accbmpanied by
 violence.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:,
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press            "
 Freedom of speech and freedom of the press are provided for by
 the Constitution. During the course of the current
 Administration, the Government has tolerated much direct
 public criticism and boldly written press articles have
 appeared.. Mexico's press is a primary source for reporting
 allegati6ns of human rights violations..
 According to the media, during 1987 several journalists died
 violently or under suspicious circumstances. Retaliation for
 coverage of local problems may have been a motive in their
 deaths. In addition, four incidents of assault against
 journalists have been brought to the public's attention. For
 example, Oscar Santiago Crisanti, a reporter for the newspaper
 El Mundo de Tampico, was shot and severely wounded in March,
 shortly after he accused'municipal police of having hired
 known criminals.

 MEXICO
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Constitution provides for the right of peaceful assembly
 for any lawful purpose. A government permit is generally
 required for major demonstrations. Within the Federal
 District, opposition political groups as well as peasant and
 indigenous organizations are allowed frequent access both to
 main boulevards and to the city's large central square for
 their demonstrations. In rare instances, unauthorized
 marches, sit-ins, and other forms of protest are broken up
 forcibly by police and security forces, especially in areas
 outside the capital.
 Basic trade union, worker, and employee rights are protected
 under Mexican law. The rights of workers to organize trade
 unions, to bargain collectively, and to strike are provided
 for under Article 123 of the Constitution.
 Mexico has a multiplicity of trade union organizations, most
 but not all of which are affiliated with the PRI. By far the
 largest of these are the Mexican Workers Confederation (CTM)
 and the Federation of Government Workers Unions (FSTSE), which
 includes most government workers. The CTM and FSTSE, as well
 as smaller federations and independent but PRI-affiliated
 unions, all belong 'to a loose, umbrella-like labor organization
 known as the Congress of Labor. Independent unions outside
 the Congress of Labor, some with a conservative orientation
 and others of a pronounced leftist or radical orientation,
 also exist. The majority of organized peasants belong to the
 PRI-affiliated National Confederation of Peasants (CNC).
 Unions in Mexico are permitted to maintain relations with
 recognized international bodies. The CTM is affiliated with
 the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU)
 and is a leading member of the ICFTU'S Inter-American Regional
 Organization of Workers (ORIT), which is headquartered in
 Mexico City. The CTM always provides the Mexican worker
 delegate to the International Labor Organization.
 A number of Congress of Labor independent unions are also
 affiliated with various international trade secretariats. The
 Communist-controlled World Federation of Tradl Unions regional
 inter-American organization maintains its headquarters in
 Mexico City.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Under the Constitution, individuals are free to practice the
 religion of their choice. However, no religious body has
 legal standing. The Constitution prohibits the clergy from
 participating in politics, voting, owning real estate, or
 wearing religious garb in public. Some of these prohibitions
 are not strictly enforced; neither is a constitutional
 restriction against preuniversity religious schools, many of
 which exist.
 Mexico is predominantly Roman Catholic. Protestant, Mormon,
 Jewish, and other religious communities also exist and are
 free to practice their forms of worship. Protestant
 evangelists and Mormons, principally from outside Mexico, are
 active and especially successful in certain rural, largely
 indigenous communities. Some critics have stated that the
 Government is selectively enforcing the anticlerical laws to
 favor the predominant Roman Catholic-Church. Other critics
 have asserted that, in some outlying areas, the laws are not
 
 
 545
 MEXICO
 being enforced against evangelical activities in order to
 reduce the influence of the Catholic Church.
 A change in the Federal ElectoralCode in 1986 subjects clergy
 to large fines and even imprisonment if they are found guilty
 of inducing the electorate to vote for or act against a
 candidate or fomenting abstention and disorder. There are
 indications the Chamber of Deputies may review the Code during
 the current legislative session.-
 Catholic and private educators have criticized the Government
 for forcing them to use government-mandated textbooks in
 religious and private schools. Critics have complained of the
 textbooks' treatment of businessmen and free enterprise.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Freedomfof movement within and outside the country is
 unrestricted, except for some areas along the Guatemalan
 border which have been closed to the public by the military
 due to unsettled conditions. Mexico has about 40,000
 Guatemalan refugees who reside in camps in southeast Mexico.
 Some 800 Guatemalans voluntarily repatriated from Mexico in
 1987. Theie-have been no reports of forcible repatriation of
 refugees.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of
 Citizens to Change Their Government
 Since 1929, Mexico has been ruled by the PRI. To secure its
 continuance in powqi*, the PRI has.relied on extensive public
 patronage, maisive government and party organizational
 resources, and, some opposition parties charge, electoral
 fraud in those contests where developed opposition party
 strength exists. Nevertheless, a total of nine political
 parties enjoy representation in the Chamber of Deputies.
 The President and senators'are elected for 6-year terms. The
 1986 Electoral Reform Law directs that one-half of the
 nation's:-Zenators be electedevery 3 years. Deputies are
 elected for 3-year terms, during the election of the President
 and, thereafter, midway through the presidential term. State
 governois are elected for 6-year terms, with elections
 staggered in the various states throughout the course. of the
 presidential term. Members of the unicameral state
 legislatures and all mayors are elected for 3-year terms.
 These elections are also staggered and, by law, no one may be
 reelected to the same office.
 Both Mexicar*'and foreign journalists, as well as opposition
 parties, charged the PRI with electoral fraud in several 1987
 elections. Criticism of government electoral practices has
 generally come from the center-right National Action Party
 (PAN), though leftist opposition parties have recently joined
 in such demifnciations. In the 1987 State of Mexico elections,
 the PAN accused the PRI of fielding a gubernatorial candidate
 who did not meet residency requirements. It also claimed that
 the PRI engaged in such irregularities as purchasing votes
 with food'coupons, stuffing ballot boxes, and intimidating
 voters and opposition party poll watchers. In both Mexico and
 Hidalgi' tates,- such practices are alleged to have contributed
 to voter apathy and high rates of electorhl abstention.
 Hidalgo's largely rural population-and poor communications may
 also have-been factors. -The Government has on occasion
 reversed electoral devisions where fraud has been alleged, and
 
 
 546
 MEXICO
 has admitted that the electoral system is an imperfect one
 which could and should be improved.
 Opposition parties are guaranteed access to the public media,
 and seats in the state and federal legislatures are reserved
 for them. Howdver, the opposition charges that access to the
 media is highly unbalanced given the day-to-day exposure which
 the PRI receives. The July 1988 general elections will be held
 under a new federal election code passed in December 1986.
 New procedures to be followed were designed to provide for the
 presence at polling stations of representatives from all
 political parties, as well as independent poll watchers.
 Also, the number of seats reserved for minority parties in the
 Chamber of Deputies has been increased from 100 to 150, with
 the total number of seats in the Chamber increasing from 400
 to 500.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government allows both domestic and international human
 rights groups to operate in Mexico without restrictions or
 harassment and has promised full cooperation with efforts by
 Amnesty International (AI) to monitor human rights violations
 in Mexico. Various ranking Mexican officials have met with AI
 representatives, domestic human rights activists, and others
 to discuss allegations of human rights violations. The
 Government has publicly committed itself to periodic
 inspection by human rights organizations and has pledged its
 complete cooperation with any such investigations. In its
 1987 Report, AI indicated that it had received detailed
 documents from the Mexican Government in response to its
 concerns about human rights violations in Mexico.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status.
 Mexico takes pride in its Spanish and Indian origins and in
 the success the country has achieved in fostering a climate of
 racial harmony. Indigenous groups, many of which do not speak
 Spanish, are encouraged to participate in political life, and
 the Government is respectful of the desire of these groups to
 retain elements of their traditional lifestyle. That these
 groups remain largely outside the country's political and
 economic mainstream is not the result of conscious policy, but
 rather the result of historical patterns of economic and
 social development.
 Religious discrimination is generally nonexistent except for
 sanctions contained in the Constitution barring the clergy
 from participating in politics, voting, owning real estate,
 and wearing religious garb in public.
 The role of women in Mexican society is in transition, and
 women are beginning to move into areas traditionally reserved
 for men. The number of women's action groups is increasing
 and they are aggressively promoting women's issues over a
 broad front. Nevertheless, although women comprise
 approximately 29 percent of the work force, they continue to
 work predominantly in nonsupervisory jobs. By law the ideal
 of equal pay for equal work is mandated. However, in practice
 a wage disparity exists between work traditionally performed
 by women and work traditionally perf-ormed by men. The PRI
 emphasizes publicly the need to increase the role of women in
 
 
 547
 MEXICO
 the political process. One of the nation's 31 governors is a
 woman, 7 of 64 senators are women, and 43 of the 400 member
 Chamber of Deputies are women, an increase of 0 over the
 previous legislature.
 Men and women are equal in principle under Mexican law. Women
 have the right to file for separation and divorce. Women can
 own property'in their own name. There is no reftriction
 against women traveling without their husbands' permission.
 CONDITIONS OF LABOR
 Mexican law sets the minimum age for the employment of
 children at 14 years; children over 14 but under 16 years of
 age may work but .are subject to special legal protections and
 shorter working hours than adults and cannot be employed in.
 certainoiobs." Child labor laws in Mexico are observed fairly
 strictly'in medium sized'arid large manufacturing and
 commercial establishments,"but less so in small shops and in
 such dccupations as street vending, where child labor is
 difficultto control.  nfordement of labor regulations can be
 accomplished hiough either the Federal Labor'Secretariat or
 the Federal. Conciliatipii and Arbitration Commission, but is in
 fact somewhat spotty.
 The law'aiso provides for a minimum wage. Labor's real
 purchasing power reportedly has eroded by at least 50 percent
 since 1942 even though minimum wage rates are now revised
 quartef -T Te'pfinciple of equal pay for equal work prevails
 in the treatment of foreign workers, but preference is given
 to Mexicand ove fo edeigners in hiring', and foreigners are not
 allowed to fdrm z'part of union ,eadershib. The maximum legal
 workweek is 48hours with'a maximum workday of 8 hours.
 Extensive regulations pertaining to occupational health and
 safety'exist, but such safety laws  arefrequently.,only
 minimally~obs~rved'in practice,"parti'ularly in the heavy
 industra:l sector and iii fhd constructiofi, industry.
