 GUYANA
 The Co-operative Republic of Guyana, a member of the Commonwealth of Nations
 and the Caribbean Community (CARICOM), is a small, multiracial developing na-
 tion with a unicameral Parliament chosen by direct election in a multiparty political
 system. The leader of the party obtaining a plurality of seats in Parliament is sworn
 in as Executive President. He appoints a rme Minister and other ministers. Na-
 tional and regional elections were held on October 5, 1992. The People's Progressive
 Party (PPP) Fed by Cheddi Jagan defeated the People's National Congress (PNC) led
 by Hugh Desmond Hoyte, which had dominated political life in Guyana since the
 1964 elections, the last held under British colonial rule. Jagan was sworn in on Oc-
 tober 9. There was general agreement among international observers that the 1992
 elections were free and fair.
 Security forces are comprised of the Guyana Defense Force (GDF) and the Guyana
 Police Force (GPF); the latter has primary responsibility for maintaining law and
 order throughout duyana. According to the U.S. Arms Control and Disarmament
 Agency, total military expenditures for 1989 were $6 million. Economic necessity
 rather than any voluntary reduction plan has resulted in a significant decrease in
 military expenditure. The police and security forces are subordinate to the civilian
 Government. Guyanese social and political life is influenced by the presence of two
 main ethnic groups, the Afro-Gu anese and the Indo-Guyanese. Urban Afro-Guya-
 nese dominate the opposition 'NC, the civil service, the GPF, and the other security
 forces; Indo-Guyanese predominate in the agricultural and business sectors and in
 the ruling PPP.
 Guyana's economy is largely agricultural, with sugar and rice important export
 earners, along with bauxite. Despite a growth rate of over 6 percent in 1991 and
 early 1992, Guyana's per capita gross domestic product remained only about $450.
 The economy suffers from high external debt, shortages of skilled labor, and a dete-
 riorating infrastructure.
 Human rights problems in Guyana continued to include police abuse of detainees
 and prisoners, limitations on workers' rights, and societal violence against women
 and children.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-No such killings are known to have
 occurred in recent years.
 
 
 416
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances,
 clandestine detentions, or abductions.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Although the Constitution prohibits torture, the independent Guyana Human Rights
 Association (GHRA) noted continuing problems with police brutality in its human
 rights report compiled in July 1992, covering the previous 12 months.
 The report stated that several people were reportedly tortured and ill-treated in
 police custo   duri   the past year, but did not give specific examples. When
 queried, GHRA members cited the case of an individual who was arrested on Janu-
 ary 10 1992 on treason charges, beaten in a variety of ways over a 2-day period,
 and subjectea to other mistreatments.
 Another well-known case in which the GHRA was active Is that of a woman ar-
 rested in January 1988 and charged with illegal possession of a firearm. Held with-
 out trial until April 1992, she testified that she had been raped by a police officer,
 but the judge instructed the jury to ignore that testimony as immaterial to the trial.
 The jury found her guilty, and %he judge gave her a mandatory life sentence under
 the National Security Act. The sentence was reduced to 5 years after the defense
 attorney informed the judge that the National Security Act had been repealed. The
 defendant is serving her sentence while her appeal is pending.
 On occasion, confessions have been thrown out of court on the grounds of having
 been coerced. There were also reports of police officers involved in criminal activity,
 including extortion, intimidation, and assault, although the number of cases has di-
 minished since 1991. Officers charged as a result of complaints to the Police Com-
 plaints Authority are routinely suspended for a few days and sometimes fined but
 are rarely jailed for their alleged offenses. Investigations into such incidents are per-
 functory and rarely result in serious disciplinary action.
 Prisons continued to experience severe overcrowding. According to the GHRA,
 women prisoners, who are all held in one prison in Guyana, do not receive regular
 family visits, as there are no facilities for such. The GHRA has called for the sus-
 pension of the mandatory prison sentence for narcotics offenses, citing it as the pri-
 mary cause of severe prison overcrowding. On the positive side, prison authorities,
 according to the GHRA, have recently shown a greater receptivity to suggestions for
 improvement in the prisons and cooperated in projects such as providing occupa-
 tional training to some prisoners.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention or Exile.-The Constitution provides that no person
 may be deprived of personal liberty except as authorized by law and also requires
 judicial determination of the legality of detention, a mandate that was generally re-
 spected in practice in 1992.
 Arrest does not require a warrant issued by a court official, only an assessment
 of guilt by the police officer. The law requires that a person arrested and held for
 more than 24 hours be brought before a court to be charged. Until the middle of
 1992 there was no bail granted for any narcotics charge, regardless of the severity
 of the crime. Magistrates now have some discretion on granting bail before trial but
 must send all persons convicted on narcotics charges to custody, even if an appeal
 is pending.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution provides that anyone charged
 with a criminal offense has the right to a hearing by a court of law, and this right
 is respected in practice. Guyana has a functioning bail system. Defendants are
 granted fair public trials, and appeal may be made to higher courts.
 There are no political prisoners or special courts for political security cases. Sev-
 eral leaders of an alleged aborted coup attempt in 1990 are still awaiting trial on
 treason charges because all treason and murder cases must be tried by the High
 Court, and the High Court's docket is overcrowded.
 In the past, some members of the opposition expressed concern over court rulings
 in libel suits brought by government officials and over other governmental use of
 the courts to harass political opponents. According to the GHRA, however, the 'udi-
 ciary exerted greater independence recently due to the generally freer political at-
 mosphere during the term of President Desmond Hoyte (1985-1992). In 1992 there
 were no new cases of this nature.
 Delays in judicial proceedings are often caused by shortages of trained court ad-
 ministrative personnel and magistrates, inadequate resources, and low salary levels.
 The inefficiency of the judicial system is so great as to undermine due process. For
 example, appeals of some murder cases have been delayed for several years. In one
 instance, a court recorder moved to a new job and took her notes of six cases with
 her, preventing any action on those cases. Opposition lawyers complain that the ju-
 diciary is prone to grant lengty postponements in trials involving the Government
 or law enforcement officials;however, postponements are routinel-y grsnted to both
 the defense and the prosecution.

 There has been no legal aid in Guyana since the 1970's, and virtually no lawyers
 work pro bono in criminal cases, except for murder, when a defense attorney is as-
 signed. The Guyana Association of Women Lawyers provides free legal services for
 civil cases only.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Government gnerally respects the right to privacy, although some opposition politi-
 cians have alleged instances of government surveillance, particularly at political
 meetings and rallies. (Uniformed police officers routinely monitor such rallies.) The
 laws requiring judicially issued warrants for searches were generally respected in
 1992.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The constitutional provision for freedom of
 speech is generally respected, and Guyanese freely criticize their Government and
 its policies but sometimes suffer retaliation for such criticism. Guyana has three pri-
 vate and one government-owned television broadcasting stations. Government-
 owned Guyana television (GTV) produces a 10-minute daily news show which pro-
 vides relatively evenhanded reporting of local events.
 During the 1992 election campaign, a number of political discussion programs
 were held to which all candidates had access. The government-owned Guyana
 Broadcasting Corporation (GBC), the only radio station, generally took an aggres-
 sive pro overnment position prior to the October election, offering live ooverage of
 PNC political activities while ignoring most opposition events. Its editor-in-chief was
 dismissed by the new Jagan Government when it took office in October.
 In past years, the Government exercised varying degrees of control over the media
 through ownership of what had been the countrys only daily newspaper (the Guy-
 ana Chronicle), the communications agency, the radio station, and the issuance of
 import licenses for newsprint and printing preses. The Government's role in the
 media, however, has declined due to the increased availability of other newspapers
 and the rap id grwth of television. The independent Staroek News expanded publi-
 cation to six times a week in 1991. The PPP-owned Mirror imported new presses
 and expanded its now twice-a-week newspaper from 4 to 16 p ages per issue. Both
 frequently criticize the Government in editoas and cans. uring the 1992 elec-
 tion campaign, all three newspapers, including the Chronicle, published full-page
 opposition advertisements in every issue, and all the television stations, government
 as well as private, carried advertisements for all the mjor and several minor par-
 ties.
 There was no restriction on academic freedom in 1992.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Public Order Act requires
 police permits for mass political meetings, and the Police Commissioner, at his dis-
 cretion and without explanation, may refuse permission for a public meeting. Dur-
 ing 1992, particularly during the election campaign, all political parties held fre-
 quent public meetings and rallies at locations throughout the country without seri-
 ous incident.
 Some minor restrictions by the Government on the conduct of political meetings
 during the 1992 election campaign were reported by opposition  litical parties and
 verified by the GHRA. Rallies for the ruling PNC were allowe to go on all night,
 but opposition rallies were checked for permits by police and told to stop their meet-
 ings earlier in the evening. Also, the state~wnedeltricity corporation was notified
 of all PNC rallies ahead of time and warned not to allow power outages during
 those times in those locations. The company's employees were authorizedovertime
 and told to have back-up facilities for those venues. No such precautions were taken
 for opposition rallies.
 c. reedom of Religion.--Guyaneae practice a wide variety of religions, with the
 major faiths being Christianity, Hinduism, and Islam. The Constitution provides for
 freedom of religion, and memrs of all faiths are allowed to worship freely. There
 are no restricti on foreign religious groups proselytizing in Guyana.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Constitution provides for reedom of movement within Guyana.
 Travel to certain Amerindian areas requires government permission, a regulation
 dating from colonial times designed to protect the indigenous peoples from exploi-
 tation. Prior to the election in October, the GHRA, opposition politicians, and some
 cler~y contended that permits were sometimes denied to missionaries and non-PNC
 politicians, and that the regulations were used to maintain PNC influence among
 the Amerindians. In practice, however, most people travel throughout these areas
 without regard to the formality of a permit. Guyanese are free to travel abroad, to
 emigrate, and to return. Guyana neither received nor generated mfugses in 1992.
 
 
 There are no forced resettlements or displaced persons, and citizenship is not denied
 on political grounds.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Guyana has a unicameral Parliament which is chosen by direct election in a
 multiparty political system based on proportional representation. The leader of the
 party which obtains a plurality of seats in Parliament during national elections is
 sworn in as Executive President. The President appoints a Cabinet, headed by a
 Prime Minister, which together with the President exercises executive power.
 Guyanese are free to join or support political parties of their choice, but until 1992
 had not had the ability to change their Government in free and fair elections. The
 PNC had won every election since 1964, but the results of every election from 1968
 until 1992 were tainted by opposition charges of massive electoral fraud.
 However, in 1990 then-President Desmond Hoyte invited the Council of Freely
 Elected Heads of Government, headed by former President Jimmy Carter, and the
 Commonwealth of Nations to recommend major reforms in the electoral process. The
 most important of these were counting and announcement of the votes at the polling
 place, preparation of a totally new list of reistered vter based on house-to-house
 enumeration, and appointment of a new Chairman of the Elections Commission
 with greater authority.
 Elections were then scheduled for December 1991. When it became evident that
 the voters' list had been improperly compiled, President Carter urged postponement
 of the elections. President Hoyte agreed, and elections were held on October 5, 1992.
 The Commonwealth sent 23 election observers to Guyana and the Carter group sent
 66, the largest number of international observers in proportion to the population
 ever to monitor an election. Representatives of the Washington-based International
 Foundation for Electoral Systems also provided assistance for the voting process.
 The consensus of the observers was that the elections were carried out in a free and
 fair manner, and the new president, Dr. Cheddi Jagan, was sworn in on October
 9. Former President Hoyte has been officially designated as Leader of the Opposi-
 tion.
 There are no impediments to women or minorities participating in the political
 process, but historically neither women nor Amerindians were encouraged to partici-
 pate or had more than minor representation. Any Guyanese citizen 18 years or older
 can register to vote, and about 80 percent of those registered cast votes in the 1992
 election. President Jagan's Cabinet includes two women, two persons of Portuguese
 descent, one of Chinese descent, eight of East Indian descent, four Afro-Guyanese,
 and one Amerindian, who is the head of the newly created Ministry of Amerindian
 Affairs. The new 65-member Parliament includes 13 women, representing both
 major parties.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The GHRA, the most active local human rights group, functioned without govern-
 ment interference in 1992. In October 1991, however, a member of the GHRA execu-
 tive was briefly detained by an unidentified man, threatened, and questioned about
 her political activities. Threatening notes were left in her home during two subse-
 quent attempted break-ins. Results of a police investigation into the incidents were
 not released.
 The GHRA is a nongovernmental organization formed in 1979 with the participa-
 tion of trade unions, professional organizations, various ethnic groups, and church-
 es. It issues periodic press releases and publishes an annual report on human rights
 in Guyana. In 1992 the Government made no public statements on either GHRA
 or foreign human rights reports.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Language, or Social Status
 The Constitution provides fundamental rights for all persons in Guyana regard-
 less of race, sex, religion or national origin. Guyanese society and political life con-
 tinue to be influenced by ethnic differences, primarily between Guyanese of African
 and Indian descent. The GHRA maintains that there are serious problems of racial
 discrimination in the civil and armed services, including the police force, all of
 which are overwhe.Iin.ly staffed by Afro-Guyanese. The Association has criticized
 the lack of legal or institutional mechanisms for redressing what it describes as dis-
 criminatory employment practices in these services. However, recruitment efforts
 targeted at Inde-Guyanese candidates for the uniformed services generally met with
 an unenthusiastic response, with most qualified Indo-Guyanese candidates opting
 for a business career over military, police, or public service.

 Guyana has a small ethnic Amerindian population, composed of nine tribal
 groups, living in reservations and villages scattered throughout the country. Their
 standard of living is lower than that of most Guyanese. The GHRA has charged that
 the Government controls Amerindian leaders and land titles and limits access to
 their reservations by clergy and other outsiders. In fad, the Government exerts in-
 fluence over the selection of leaders, but all are free to criticize the Government and
 many actively and openly oppose government policies. The Government distributed
 land titles to Amerindian communities du   1991 and 1992, but the GHRA criti.
 cized the allocations because they were smaller than recommended and did not in-
 clude mineral rights. In November the new Government created the position of Min-
 ister of Amerindian Affairs and appointed an Amerindian to fill it.
 In principle the Constitution prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex and
 commits the overnment to ensure equal pay for equal work. However, a 1988 gov.
 ernment-sponsored constitutional amendment rendered the equal pay provision un-
 enforceable except in cases in which equal pay for equal work is provided for by spe.
 cific statute. No such statutes have been enacted.
 In 1990 the Parliament passed legislation granting equal rights to women jnd
 lefgislation that protects women's property rights under common law marriage, enti-
 tling a woman who separates or divorces to one-half of the couple's property if she
 had been working and one-third of the property if she had been a housewife. Addi-
 tionally, the legislation gave authority to the court to overturn a man's will in the
 event it did not provide for the wife.
 There are few organizations, other than those asonsred by political parties, that
 focus primarily on women's rights. One exception is the Guyana Chapter of the Car-
 ibbean Association for Feminist Research, which announced in December that it
 would open a counseling center 4 days a week for victims of violent relationships.
 Violence against women and children, including domestic violence, is considered a
 significant problem. In a November speech, the new First Lady, Mr. Janet Jagan,
 noting that violence against women was a 'very, very important issue,' called for
 the establishment of counselg cinics women's shelters, and a family advisory bu-
 reau. Victims of such abuse often are reluctant to report it to the authorities or to
 press charges, and underreporting of incidents of such violence makes it impossible
 to estimate its true extent. While victims have access to the courts for redress, cul-
 tural inhibitions limit the willingness of women to pursue their claims. The Govern-
 ment has not recommended additional legislation or other remedial action.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The right of association is provided for in the Con-
 stitution, which specifically enumerates a worker's right to 'form or belong to trade
 unions.* Employers are not required by law to recognize a union in a workplace,
 even if an overwhelming majority of workers have indicated their desire to be rep-
 resented by a union. Trade union recognition legislation proposed in 1991 ItM
 awaits mal approval in ParliamenL
 Approximately one-quarter of Guyana's total work force of about 250,000 is for-
 mally organized. Most union members work in the pblic sector and in state-owned
 enterprises. Organized labor in Guyana consists of ne major national federation.
 the Guyana Trades Union Congress (TUC), composed of 17 unions, and the riv
 Federation of Independent Trades Unions of Guyana (FITUG) whose 6 affiliates in-
 dude the militant sugar and bauxite workers' unions. The ITUG unions, which
 broke away from the UC in 1988 over the latter's longstandg alignment with the
 ruing PNC party engaged in reunification talks with the TUC but deferred any
 fineal decision pending th holding of a special congress.
 There is a tradition of close ties between Guyana's trade union movement and po-
 litical parties, particularly the PNC which had controlled the Government (and thus
 pubic sector employment) for 28 years. Many of the 24 unions in the TUC are for-
 mally affiliated witthe PNC. Common opposition to government policies helped
 bring the TUC and FITUG closer together. Historically, the political parties, both
 the PC and the opposition parties, have wielded significant influence over the
 leadership of a number of unions, and trade union officials often served in dual roles
 as party officials. Former President Hoyte is honorary president of a TUC union,
 and new President Cheddi Jagan holds the same title in one of FITUG's sugar work-
 ers' unions. The deteriorating economic situation, worker unhappiness over the poli-
 cies of the last government, and the decision of the TUC leadership to withhold its
 endorsement from any candidate, however, have served to weaken somewhat party
 influence within organized labor.
 Workers have a generally recognized right to strike, although some recent cases
 of industrial action have resulted in wide spread dismicsals. Public employees pro-
 viding essential services are normally forbidden to strike, but a procedure exists for
 
 
 420
 the review of their grievances by a tribunal sppointed by the Minister of Labor.
 During 1992, doctors at the publc hospital and electricity workers at the municipal
 power plant staged strikes or work-to-rule actions. There were also strikes by sugar
 workers, teachers, shipping company personnel, telephone company employees, and
 university employees, generally to seek higher pay and/or improved working condi-
 tions. Most of these strikes or work-to-rule actions were resolved peacefully, but the
 shipping company fired its striking employees. The public services union called a
 1-day strike in mid-1992 by all public servants, but essential services were not af-
 fected.
 Labor disputes are frequently settled through consultation and dialogue without
 resorting to strikes or other industrial action. Unions and their federations freely
 maintain relations with recognized Caribbean and international trade union and
 professional groups. All three of the major international labor federations have af-
 filiates in Guyana.
 b. The Right to Organize and .&rgain Collectively.-Public and private sector em-
 ployees possess and utilize the generally accepted right to organize and to bargain
 collectively. The Labor Ministry certifies all collective bargaining agreements and
 has never refused to do so. This right is not codified, however, and employers are
 not legally required to recognize unions or bargain with them. Increasingly, unions
 of public sector enterprises bargain directly with employers rather than through
 TUYC/government negotiations, but bargaining for publi employees remains hi~by
 centralized, and wage negotiations take place between the TUC and the Ministiy
 of Finance.
 The TUC's traditional ties (through individual unions) to the former PNC-con-
 trolled government limited the unions' ability to negotiate effectively on behalf of
 workers, with the result that salaries were often set solely by the Government.
 The Chief Labor Officer and the staff of the Ministry of Labor provide consulta-
 tion, enforcement, and conciliation services. In 1990, the latest year for which fig-
 ures are available 26 collective bargaining agreements were concluded and certified
 by the Ministry of Labor. The Ministry has a-aklog of cases, and insufficient man-
 power and transportation severely limit the Ministry's ability to carry out its func-
 tions.
 The Ministry of Labor documented no cases of antiunion discrimination during
 1992. However, union leaders make credible charges that workers attempting to
 unionize workplaces are harassed and intimidated and that the Ministry does not
 expeditiously investigate complaints that employers are dismissing workers when
 confronted with union organizing efforts. For example, two bauxite shipping compa-
 nies refused to recognize and deal with unions formed at the workplace even though
 strikes occurred since January 1992. The companies simply hired new employees to
 replace the striking workers.
 Guyana has no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.--The Constitution prohibits forced
 or compulsory labor, and there is no indication that it exists.
 . d. Minimum Age of Employment of Children.-Minimum age laws are set out in
 the Factories Act andthe Employment of Women, Young Persons, and Children Act.
 Legally, no person under 14 years of age may be employed in any industrial under-
 taking, and no person under 16 may be employed at night, except under regulated
 circumstances. The terms "industry" and "factory as used in the law have been in-
 terpreted by the Ministry of Labor to encompass nearly all workplaces except offices
 and retail shops. According to the law, children under age 14 may be employed only
 in enterprises in which members of the same family are employed. The local eco-
 nomic situation has forced more and more young children into the work force, how-
 ever, and it is common to see children under 14 selling candy, cigarettes, and other
 items along the roads throughout the country. While cognizant of the situation, the
 Ministry of Labor does not employ sufficient inspectors to enforce existing laws ef-
 fectively.
 e. Acceptable Conditions atWor.-The Government legislates a public sector min-
 imum wage. While private employers generally pay a higher rate, there is no statu-
 tory minimum wage for the private sector. The minimum wage is not currently suf-
 ficient to provide a decent standard of living for a family.
 Hours of employment are set under the Pactories Act and vary by industry and
 sector. Work in excess of an 8-hour day and a 40-hour week requires payment of
 an overtime rate.
 The Factories Act sets forth workplace safety and health standards. The Occupa-
 tional Health and Safety Division of the Ministry of Labor is charged with conduct-
 ing factory inspections and investigating charges of substandard workplaces and
 conditions. As with its other responsibilities, inadequate resources have prevented
 
 
 the Ministry from effectively carrying out this function. Occupational health and
 safety standards are also prescribed in the Factories Act.
