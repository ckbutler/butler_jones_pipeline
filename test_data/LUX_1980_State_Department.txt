 LUXEMBOURG
 Luxembourg is a parliamentary democracy under a
 constitutional monarchy. Although sometimes occupied
 militarily in the past, Luxembourgers have always
 maintained their individualism and spirit of
 independence. Thus, Luxembourg's leaders, many of whom
 still carry the psychological scars of detention during
 the Nazi occupation, are determined to ensure that human
 rights are respected in Luxembourg and to work for
 increased respect for human rights worldwide.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 Torture is prohibited by law (Penal Code, Chapter 4,
 Article 438, and November 4, 1950 International Convention
 Safeguarding the rights of men and fundamental liberties)
 and is not practiced.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 Treatment of prisoners is exemplary. Prisoners have free
 choice of attorneys and are allowed visitors. A new
 modern prison is scheduled to open soon.
 c. Disappearances
 Official abduction or secret arrest does not occur.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment:
 There are no prisoners in Luxembourg who are being
 detained in disregarC of generally accepted principles.
 Habeas corpus exists and is respected. The law permits
 detention without charge for up to 24 hours following
 arrest.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Luxembourg has an independent judiciary. Defendants have
 right to legal counsel. Charges are formally and clearly
 stated. There is the right of appeal.
 f. Invasion of the Home
 Police must have warrants, issued by the judiciary, to
 enter a private home. No forced entry has been alleged.
 The Government of Luxembourg does not practice other
 violations of the home such as bugging, demolition or
 sealing doors and windows.
 2. Governmental Policies Relating to the Fulfillment
 of Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care
 and Education
 Luxembourg has an affluent society which was sustained
 mainly by steelmaking. Reacting to a decline in the steel
 industry, the government, in cooperation with industry and
 labor, has worked to modernize and diversify the economic
 base. Luxembourg has been successful in maintaining its
 high standard of living, but the continuing world-wide
 steel crisis and an aging population, which will put
 greater demands on the country's social benefits system,
 pose serious problems for the future. Although the
 Luxembourg economy has traditionally been male dominated,
 
 
 835
 the economy's modernization has led to new employment
 opportunities for both men and women. The conservative
 nature of Luxembourg society still results in
 discrimination against women, especially those seeking
 managerial responsibility.
 The per capita GDP was $10,500 (1979) with an estimated
 inflation rate of 6.5% for 1980. The economic growth rate
 for 1980 is estimated at 1.5% with an unemployment rate of
 0.6% (Average for first half of 1980). Government
 unemployment calculations do not include workers who have
 lost their steel making jobs but have been retrained by
 the steel industry and are farmed out to work on special
 projects or on public works. This program is financially
 supported parially by the government.
 The average industrial wage is $7.50 not including fringe
 benefits. Of a total population of 363,700 (1978) there
 were and 92,900 aliens, 26% of the population. The
 literacy rate is 100 %; life expectancy is 69.6 years and
 the infant mortality rate is 13 per thousand live births.
 Luxembourg has an exemplary record in protecting the
 economic rights of the entire population. Foreign workers
 and their families have the same economic rights as
 Luxembourgers.
 Property Ownership
 There are no bars to property ownership
 Work Pay and Conditions
 Work remuneration, government social benefits and working
 conditions are good, and are determined by active
 dialogues between the government, labor unions and
 enterprises. Foreign workers are concentrated in
 construction and other manual work except steelmaking.
 The shrinking Luxembourg work force has tended to eschew
 manual work in favor of white collar employment
 Standard of Living
 The standard of living is high. Income distribution is
 relatively homogenious. Most people are in the middle
 class. There are some individual cases of poverty among
 rural Luxembourgers and newly arrived foreign workers, but
 comprehensive government programs provide for vital needs.
 Education
 There are no bars to education, and 10 years of schooling
 are compulsory. Acceptance for post compulsory education
 is by merit.
 3. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties,
 Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 The constitution guarantees freedom of speech press,
 religion and assembly (Articles 19, 20 and 24). Except
 for restrictions against pornography, there is no media
 censorship. The government does not intimidate or make
 threats against individuals or media organs criticizing it
 and does not interfere with academic inguiry . There are
 no limitations on orderly public meetings. No groups are
 denied or restricted free assembly. Unions have the right
 to organize, negotiate and strike. Luxembourg does not
 have a state religion and there is no discrimination
 against practitioners of minority religions. The
 population is 99% Roman Catholic and this faith is deeply
 intertwined with the conservative culture of the country.
 Thus a Roman Catholic consensus often surfaces on social
 issues, e.g. no government funding for abortions.

 b. Freedom of Movement within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration and Repatriation
 There are no restrictions on women or any other groups,
 regarding movement within Luxembourg, foreign travel,
 emigration and repatriation. Luxembourg has a liberal
 refugee and asylum policy in principle, but admits only
 limited numbers of refugees. Foreigners applying for
 residence tend to be judged on the value of their skills
 and their means. An exception to this was Luxembourg's
 acceptance of over 100 Vietnamese refugees in 1979/80.
 Refugees admitted to Luxembourg have been well treated.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Luxembourg is a parliamentary democracy in which all
 citizens at least 18 years old can participate.
 Luxembourg's sizable foreign resident population does not
 have the right to particiapte in the political process
 although its members enjoy the rights of free speech,
 press, assembly, movement and religion. Significant
 numbers of women participate in both politics and
 government.
 4. Government Attitude and Record Regarding
 International and Non-governmental Investigation
 of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The current and prior Luxembourg governments have
 supported international and non-governmental investigation
 of alleged violations of human rights. The Red Cross,
 Amnesty International and the UN High Commission for
 Refugees have representatives in Luxembourg who would be
 alert to any human rights violations. Luxembourg as a
 strong advocate for the respect of human rights,
 consistently supports human rights in the Council of
 Europe and the European Communities.
