 ARGENTINA
 Argentina is a federal, constitutional democracy with a
 president elected through an electoral college for a.single
 6-year term, a bicameral legislature, and an independent
 judiciary. Traditionally, the executive is the dominant
 branch. Since the end of military rule in 1983, there have
 been four national elections. In May 1989 the voters elected
 Justicialist Party candidate Carlos Menem as the nation's
 President. The inauguration of Menem on July 8, 1989, marked
 the first constitutional turnover of the presidency from one
 democratically elected president to another from an opposing
 party since 1916. Candidates in the 1989 elections
 represented the political spectrum from conservative to far
 left.
 The President is the constitutional Commander-in-Chief, while
 a civilian Defense Minister oversees the armed forces. The
 federal police report to the Interior Minister; provincial
 police are organized under provincial constitutions and report
 to locally elected provincial governors.
 Argentina, one of the wealthiest countries of South America,-
 has a mixed agricultural and industrial economy. Agricultural
 exports, particularly grain, represent the major source of
 foreign exchange earnings. Inflation was 1,344 percent in
 1990. Argentina initiated token monthly payments on its
 foreign commercial bank debt but still has significant arrears
 on an external debt of more than $60 billion. Foreign
 investment remained weak and capital flight continued to be a
 problem. The Government undertook to reduce the fiscal
 deficit by cutting government expenditures, increasing the
 collection of taxes, reducing the size of the public work
 force, and privatizing several state-owned enterprises-which
 were generally-unprofitable.
 Argentines enjoy a wide range of constitutionally protected
 freedoms and individual rights. Principal human rights
 concerns during the year were incidents of torture and
 unlawful killing by police, President Menem's 1990 pardon of
 former junta members convicted of human rights violations and
 1989 pardons of other military officers accused of human
 rights violations, intimidation of judges and other officials
 by rightwing and leftwing groups and police, and
 discrimination against women rooted in traditional social
 attitudes.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 There were no credible reports of politically motivated
 killings carried out by government forces in 1990, but there
 was widespread criticism of excessive use of force in dealing
 with criminal suspects, which on occasion resulted in deaths.
 Informed observers believe that police routinely shoot to kill
 without cause. Such abuses are illegal, and the courts have
 ordered the arrest and sentencing to prison of several police
 officials for unjustifiable killings. For example, three
 police officers were sentenced in May to prison terms of 5 to
 12 years for the 1987 killing of three youths. Four police
 officials were sentenced to 16 years in prison in September
 for the 1988 murder of two youths in Rosario.
 
 
 ARGENTINA
 Politically motivated bombings continued on the reduced scale
 noted in 1989. Most were small explosions late at night,
 causing material damage but few injuries. A notable exception
 was the serious injuring of three police officers in August
 when a bomb exploded as they were attempting to disarm it in
 front of a bank. Bomb targets during the year included
 political, military, church, press, trade union, and judicial
 officials, as well as a variety of political party offices,
 banks, small businesses, and public buildings. The obscure
 Che Guevara Brigade claimed responsibility for some of these
 incidents, and an organization that claimed to represent
 dissident military personnel took responsibility for others.
 Five army noncommissioned officers were arrested in April and
 charged with participating in a February bombing incident in
 or near army installations in Cordoba. Following an
 investigation by a federal judge, the case was dismissed, but
 the military subsequently discharged the five individuals
 involved. Human rights groups report that their reviews of
 bombing incidents indicate that most, if not all, involve
 personal or political motives often associated with internal
 disputes within political parties or groups who are opposed to
 economic reform measures.
 b. Disappearance
 During 1990, there were reports that three persons disappeared
 after having been detained for common criminal activities.
 Human rights officials speculate that in all three cases the
 detainees may have been killed, perhaps under torture, and
 then "disappeared" to avoid judicial investigations. Judicial
 proceedings continued in the complex, highly emotional efforts
 to ascertain the whereabouts and identity of children of those
 who disappeared during the period of military governments.
 Legislation introduced by the executive in August provided
 that those found guilty of depriving others illegally of their
 liberty, or of causing others to disappear, would be subject
 to a penalty of life in prison, which is the same penalty that
 is provided for premeditated murder. This new clause in the
 penal code was inserted to remove any possible legal flaw that
 might prevent the prosecution of future disappearance cases.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 The Constitution prohibits torture, and the criminal code
 provides penalties for torture which are similiar to those for
 homicide (8 to 25 years in prison). However, during 1990
 there were several cases in which police officers were
 suspended, charged, and sentenced to prison for torturing or
 otherwise mistreating persons suspected of criminal
 activities. Perhaps the most publicized case was that of
 police subcommissioner Luis Patti, who was jailed for a brief
 period in October on charges of torturing two detainess. He
 and three other police officials under his command reportedly
 used electric cattle prods, plastic bags, and clubs against
 the prisoners to force a confession. Patti and the others
 were released from detention by order of the investigating
 judge, but the investigation continued at year's end.
 Judicial investigations of possible torture by security forces
 of survivors of the January 1989 terrorist attack against an
 army installation oontinued in 1990, but human rights lawyers
 were critical of the slow and secret nature of these
 investigations   various international human rights
 
 
 ARGENTINA
 organizations raised this issue with the Government on behalf
 of local human rights groups and urged some form of U.N. or
 other international involvement. The Government maintained
 that the courts would have sole responsibility for this
 investigation.
 Prisons are overcrowded, with poor medical facilities and a
 reported inadequacy of food. In May, 33 prisoners died in a
 fire in an overcrowded jail. Human rights organizations
 condemned this tragedy as indicative of the extremely poor
 prison conditions. The Interior Ministry's Director for Human
 Rights initiated a series of prison visits to focus the
 attention of prison officials on the need to keep human rights
 concerns-in the open, and to let prison guards know that
 prisoners with complaints have access to the Interior
 Ministry's Human Rights Office to voice their concerns.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Argentina has a well-developed penal code containing explicit
 protections of individual rights and controls on police arrest
 and investigatory powers. Arrests require probable cause or a
 judicial order, and the law provides for a judicial
 determination of the legality of detention. However, the
 penal code, parts of which were under review by the
 legislature during 1990, gives the courts authority to detain
 persons without notice or charges for up to 8 days during an
 investigation. Even in cases of minor offenses, holding
 susp9cts wihout charges for several days is not uncommon.
 Human rights officials oppose this power, noting that most
 instances of torture or abuse of prisoners tend to occur
 during this early period of detention. Involuntary exile is
 not permitted or practiced.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Argentina's judicial system'is widely recognized as fair and
 independent, albeit slow and cumbersome. The Constitution and
 penal code provide for trials before judges and appellate
 review of all judicial rulings, including those of military
 courts. Federal courts interpret constitutional protection
 against "arbitrary" trial process to permit wide-ranging
 review of criminal prosecutions. As in most civil law
 countries, trial by jury does not normally exist; judges
 render verdicts. The Administration sent draft legislation to
 the legislature to change portions of the penal code to permit
 broader use of oral arguments before a three-judge panel.
 These changes, if accepted, are expected to speed the judicial
 process and help alleviate crowding in the court schedules.
 Human rights organizations support these changes.
 The police have legal authority to adjudicate misdemeanors,
 which are often settled by senior police officials. The legal
 system provides public defenders, but in 1990 the caseload
 exceeded their capacity. The right to bail is provided by law
 and observed in practice.
 The human rights community during 1990 continued to criticize
 the Supreme Court's broad interpretation of the "Due Obedience
 Law"; it had earlier criticized passage of the law itself. It
 also continued to oppose President Menem's 1989 pardon of
 military officers charged with human rights violations, as
 well as his December 1990 pardon of senior military officers
 previously convicted and sentenced for such crimes. Court
 proceedings against one military officer not covered by
 
 
 494
 ARGENTINA
 President Menem's pardons, the "Due Obedience Law" (which
 relieved all but senior officers of culpability), or the
 "Punto Final (Final Point) Law" (which ended new prosecutions
 of military personnel in 1986) continued in a federal
 appellate court.
 On December 29, 1990, President Menem pardoned former military
 junta members Jorge Videla, Eduardo Massera, Roberto Viola,
 Orlando Ramon Agosti, Armando Lambruschini, and other military
 and government officials convicted of human rights abuses
 during the era of military rule. Former Montenero leader
 Mario Firmenich was also pardoned. The decision was sharply
 criticized by human rights groups. Menem defended the pardons
 as a necessary step towards national reconciliation.
 Judicial investigations into allegations of abuse of authority
 or corruption are sometimes hindered by violence against
 judges and other judicial authorities. There were several
 instances in which judges and other governmental officials
 were the victims of threats, bombings, shootings, and other
 attempts at intimidation. In October a previously unknown
 group calling itself the Interforces Commando of Argentine
 Police made a series of threats against one of the judges
 involved in the Patti case (see Section l.c.). This group
 also made phone threats against other judges, at least one
 national deputy, and various journalists involved in this and
 other investigations involving police use of torture. In a
 separate incident in June, a judge assigned to investigate the
 firing of shots at another federal judge's parked automobile
 ordered the arrest of a police officer assigned to guard the
 federal judge's home. The federal judge whose car was hit by
 gunfire was one of those who had received threats against his
 life for investigating police torture cases. A senior
 Ministry of Interior official denied the existence of
 "parapolice" groups, but admitted that some police officials
 might be involved in instances of intimidation.
 Draft legislation was introduced to provide for financial
 indemnization of victims, or their families, of human rights
 abuses by the military governments. Also, the Attorney
 General ruled that victims of human rights violations may file
 court claims against those officials who benefited from
 presidential pardons. Human rights organizations expressed
 concerns that these provisions may not be broad enough to
 benefit most victims. The Supreme Court was enlarged from
 five to nine members during the year. The Government argued
 this was necessary to improve the Court's efficiency.
 Political observers and human rights leaders argued that this
 change endangered the independence of the Court and of the
 entire judicial system. They also opposed legislation
 submitted to Congress that would alter the internal security
 laws by permitting a military role in civil disturbances.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 There is constitutional protection against unreasonable search
 and seizure, and the State generally does not intrude
 arbitrarily into the private lives of persons. However,
 during 1990 there were credible reports of security agencies
 tapping telephones of political personalities and human rights
 organizations. Police forces conducted several massive
 neighborhood sweeps in shantytowns surrounding major urban
 areas, prompted by growing public concerns over personal and
 property safety threatened by rising crime rates. The
 
 
 495
 ARGENTINA
 overwhelming presence of heavily armed police units, some
 supported by helicopters, who entered homes without specific
 judicial orders and detained suspects without clear cause
 (although most were released within hours) was cited by human
 rights organizations as an abuse of authority.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Argentina enjoys an essentially free and vigorous press;
 exceptions are loudly publicized and protested by the national
 editors and publishers association, ADEPA. There continue to
 be charges that the Government uses its large advertising
 budget to influence or punish opposition publications.
 Since the reestablishment of democracy in 1983, both the Menem
 and Alfonsin administrations have taken positive steps to
 promote the rights of citizens to be informed and to express
 their ideas through the press. In addition, the current
 Government privatized several television and radio stations.
 The State continues to maintain its national radio and
 television network as well as TELAM, the national news agency.
 A vigorous national policy debate on press freedom was
 engendered by a Senate-originated bill to change the penal
 code to punish State employees who provide certain types of
 information to the press. The media and ADEPA protested this
 bill as a dangerous threat to press freedom because it would
 limit journalists' sources of information. By year's end, the
 bill had not cleared the Senate, President Menem expressed his
 intention to veto any such legislation, and various members of
 the lower house had announced their intention to oppose the
 measure.
 Academic freedom is respected.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 All groups and political parties are free to organize and
 assemble. The law requires political parties to support the
 Constitution and a democratic, representative, republican, and
 federal form of government in order to register for
 elections. During the year, no party was denied
 registration. All major political parties were able to hold
 mass rallies without interference. The labor movement, human
 rights organizations, ethnic communities, and other groups
 held frequent demonstrations and rallies without incident.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 The Constitution provides for the free exercise of religion.
 Missionaries for any religion are permitted to enter Argentina
 and proselytize, and the non-Catholic population is growing.
 Argentina's Jewish community (at an estimated 300,000, the
 largest in Latin America) practices its religion without
 official interference or legal restriction. In August the
 Senate approved a change in the penal code that would provide
 for a prison sentence of 1 to 4 years for persons found guilty
 of abuse of religious beliefs.
 
 
 ARGENTINA
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 International and internal travel as well as emigration are
 basically unrestricted. During 1990 human rights organizatons
 assisted in mounting a legal challenge to the use of
 administrative denial of passports to those convicted of
 crimes who have served their sentences. They charged that
 this practice was a denial of the constitutional right to
 leave and return to Argentina. Refugees are not forced to
 return to countries from which they have fled.
 Argentina, which has an estimated 1 million illegal residents,
 temporarily suspended immigration processing for certain Asian
 citizens in order to investigate charges that some of these
 immigrants were fraudulently obtaining Argentine resident
 status, in some cases for the purpose of future migration
 (legal or illegal) to the United States or Canada.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Since September 1983, Argentina has held four national
 elections to choose federal, provincial, and local officials.
 These elections were free, fair, and democratic, with
 universal suffrage. The Justicialist Party (Peronist)
 currently controls the executive and, in an alliance with
 smaller parties, the legislative branches of government.
 Political parties traversing a wide ideological spectrum are
 represented in Congress as a result of the 1987 and 1989
 elections. Additional parties hold office in individual
 provinces. Argentina's opposition parties operate without
 hindrance.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government cooperates fully with international human
 rights organizations, which enjoy unrestricted access in
 Argentina. Domestic human rights organizations operate
 openly, despite occasional and anonymous threats and
 harassment, such as alleged tapping of telephones by state
 security agencies.
 The Government has facilitated efforts by domestic human
 rights organizations to address international bodies in
 opposition to the Government's policies of amnesty for
 military officials, and has cooperated with the United Nations
 Human Rights Commission's efforts to investigate cases
 involving missing children from the 1976-83 period of military
 rule.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 The law prohibits discrimination based on sex, race, religion,
 language, and social status. However, Argentine women have to
 contend with bias rooted in the sociocultural traditions of
 the country. Women face de facto discrimination in certain
 job areas. For example, during 1990 a national deputy took up
 the case of three young women denied entry into the air force
 flight training school. They were not allowed to take any of
 the entry tests, and were reportedly told that women could not
 
 
 497
 ARGENTINA
 apply despite that fact that there is no legal impediment to
 such applications.
 Violence against women is not approved by society or-the
 Government, but such abuse, including domestic violence such
 as wife beating, exists. According to various groups
 representing women, there is an increase in the number of
 cases being brought to their attention and before the courts.
 They credit this to greater public awareness of this problem,
 and to the increased socioeconomic problems affecting many
 Argentine families. Sexual harassment is also being given
 greater attention, and informed observers state that more
 women are coming forward to denounce various types of
 aggression encountered at home and on the job.
 There were occasional incidents of anti-Semitism in
 Argentina. President Menem maintains a close relationship
 with leaders of the local Jewish community, and attended a
 Jewish religious ceremony in May to show solidarity with the
 Jewish community after incidents in Europe in which Jewish
 cemeteries were desecrated. A federal judge who submitted his
 resignation before impeachment proceedings could be concluded
 against him admitted in the press that he was anti-Semitic and
 blamed the Jewish community for his legal problems.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 The labor movement, which represents about one-third of the
 national work force, is a major independent economic and
 political force. Trade unions are independent of the
 Government. Although the vast majority of union leaders are
 allied to the ruling Justicialist Party and are active in the
 Peronist movement, they retain their freedom of decisionmaking
 outside of party control.
 The right of association was enhanced by laws passed in 1987
 and 1988 which restored some laws and rights suspended by
 previous military governments, but segments of these laws are
 criticised as restricting the ability of rival union
 organizations to organize and bargain collectively. Trade
 unions are free to associate with international organizations,
 and many Argentine unions are affiliated with, and active in,
 international trade union groups.
 The Government actively cooperated with the International
 Labor Organization (ILO) in investigating complaints by
 Argentine and international trade union groups concerning
 possible violations of worker rights in collective bargaining,
 job security, freedom of association, conciliation, and the
 right to strike. In late 1989 the Government requested the
 ILO to send a mission to investigate some of these
 complaints. The mission visited Argentina in March, and the
 Government assisted in attempting to resolve issues raised in
 the findings.
 Unions have the right to strike, subject to compulsory
 conciliation and arbitration by the Labor Ministry. Workers
 have.the right to receive their salaries while on strike until
 the Labor Ministry orders compulsory conciliation. Strikes by
 teachers, state-owned enterprise employees, and civil servants
 dominated the strike scene in 1990, prompting the Menem
 administration to issue a decree in mid-October which
 regulates the right to strike in essential services.
 
 
 ARGENTINA
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 By law, labor and management have a binding collective
 bargaining process which sets wage levels on an industrywide
 basis. The State's involvement in this process is limited to
 ratifying the agreements, which provides them with legal
 status. The Government directly sets wages in state-owned
 enterprises and for civil servants, generally following
 consultations with the unions. Antiunion discrimination is
 prohibited by law, and well-developed mechanisms are in place
 and functioning to resolve complaints. Some provinces provide
 rights and obligations additional to those in federal
 legislation.
 There is no officially designated export processing zone in
 Argentina.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Forced or compulsory labor is illegal in Argentina and is not
 practiced.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 The law prohibits the employment of children under 14 years of
 age, except in the family. Minors of ages 14 and 15 may work
 in restricted types of employment, but not more than 6 hours a
 day or 35 hours a week. The same law applies to minors 16 to
 18 years of age, although competent authority may allow
 exceptions. Violations are tried before the appropriate
 courts. Enforcement of child labor laws has declined as the
 severe economic crisis has led many families to have as many
 members employed as possible.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 Argentina offers comprehensive protection of workers' rights.
 The maximum workday is 8 hours; the workweek is 48 hours.
 Premiums must be paid for work beyond these limits. Rules
 governing vacations, minimum wages, and occupational health
 and safety are comparable to those in Western industrial
 nations, and are enforced by the Government and labor unions
 in the formal economy. Argentina has a large underground or
 informal economy which employs an undetermined number of
 people, including children. This sector is difficult to
 police, and employers often deny basic rights and benefits to
 employees because the employees fear losing their jobs if they
 report labor code violations to the authorities. The
 Administration in 1990 introduced legislation to regulate
 employment in the informal economy as part of an overall
 package of reforms in the employment system.
 The official minimum wage in Argentina for much of 1990
 remained the same as'that set in June 1989, and, due to
 extreme inflation, amounted to the equivalent of $3.45 a month
 by late September. Government employers and trade union
 officials agreed this was not sufficient to provide a decent
 standard of living, and they met in late September to change
 the monthly minimum wage to approximately $124. Wage levels
 in general suffered from the effects of inflation in 1990, and
 real wages in many sectors reportedly fell during the year as
 the economic recession worsened. Job security became the
 major goal of most unions after the official unemployment
 survey conducted in May indicated that unemployment and
 underemployment reached historic levels.
