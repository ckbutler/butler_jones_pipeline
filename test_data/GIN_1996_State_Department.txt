 GUINEA
 President Lansana Conte took office as Head of State of the Republic of Guinea
 in 1994, after multiparty elections in which the Government dominated the electoral
 process. Guinea he d its first multiparty legislative elections in 1995, delivering
 more than 60 percent of Parliament's seats to President Conte's Party of Unity and
 Progress (PUP). The PUP is one seat short of the majority required to make con-
 stitutional amendments. Opposition leaders, some international observers, and seg-
 ments of the citizenry voiced suspicion of PUP's considerable victories in both par-
 liamentary and municipal elections. Although the PUP continues to dominate all
 three branches of government, opposition parties have on occasion persuaded PUP
 members of Parliament to vote with the opposition on specific legislative matters.
 The judiciary is subject to executive influence, particularly in politically sensitive
 cases.
 Some 2,000 soldiers, protesting low salaries and meager benefits, mutinied Feb-
 uary 2-3. The mutiny evolved into an attempted coup d'etat that nearly toppled
 the Government; it killed an estimated 30 to 50 people in Conakry, mostly civilians.
 President Conte fired his Minister of Defense on February 2, naming himself Min-
 ister, and appointed a Prime Minister and a new Government in July'.
 The gendarmerie and the national police share responsibility for internal security
 and sometimes play an oppressive role in the daily lives of citizens. The Red Be-
 rets-autonomous presidential guards-are accountable to almost no one except the
 President. Members of all the security forces, whom many citizens view as corrupt,
 ineffective, and even dangerous, frequently committed human rights abuses.
 Eighty percent of Guinea's 7 million citizens engage in subsistence agriculture,
 and annual per capita gross domestic product is about $740. Major exports include
 bauxite, gold, diamonds, fruit, and coffee.

 The Government continued to circumscribe human rights. Its tight control of the
 electoral process and lack of an independent electoral oversight mechanism call into
 serious doubt the ability of citizens to change the government. Major human rights
 abuses include: Extrajudicial killings by security forces; politically motivated dis-
 appearances related to the mutiny, police abuse of prisoners and detainees; use of
 torture by military personnel; inhuman prison conditions; instances of arbitrary ar-
 rest and detention; governmental failure to guarantee access by attorneys to clients
 in prison; the executive branch's influence over the judicial system and the electoral
 process; occasional instances of vigilante justice; infringement on citizens' privacy,
 restrictions on freedom of speech and the press; societal discrimination and violence
 against women; and prostitution and genital mutilation of young girls.
 The Government dominated the electoral process. Leaders of the PUP called for
 the creation of an independent electoral commission. An independent press criticized
 the Government, but is subject to a broad range of restrictions, including arrest of
 reporters and suspension of publication. The Government owns and operates the
 electronic media, the major medium for reaching the vast majority of the public.
 The Cabinet appointed in July announced measures to combat security force
 abuses (including the creation of a discipline council); several cabinet members pub-
 licl acknowledged shortcomings of the security apparatus and the need for substan-
 tareform. The Ministry of Justice and the Naonal Assembly attempted to edu-
 cate the citizenry about the judicial process and individual rights.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Kiling.-There were no reports of targeted
 political killings, but there were several extrajudicial killings by security forces.
 Soldiers involved in the February mutiny killed between 30 and 50 persons, most-
 ly civilians who were victims of stray fire. The Government made numerous arrests
 and announced charges, but no trials have taken place. In March uniformed soldiers
 killed Colonel Sony Bangoura, Commander of the Alpha Yaya military camp in
 Conakry. The independent press reported several detentions in this case, but the
 Government did not announce any arrests or findings (see Section 1.c.).
 The independent press reported that two detainees awaiting trial for murder and
 robbery in Telimele, Dian Oury Kante and Mahamed Diallo, died in custody in
 April. There was no investigation. Authorities confirmed that air force major
 Mamady Conde, detained in connection with the February mutiny, died in custody
 in Conakry in June. A prosecuting attorney said that Conde died from a diabetic
 attack. Conde's family called for an independent autopsy. The Government took no
 further action and announced no results.
 Deaths in custody due to inhuman prison conditions and inadequate medical
 treatment are frequent (see Section 1.c.).
 Liberian rebels killed dozens of Guineans and Liberian refugees during border in-
 cursions (see Section 2.d.).
 There has been no investigation into the January 1995 deaths of 16 civilian pris-
 oners while in police custody. There has been no action on the case of the policeman
 arrested for killing a youth following a rally in Conakry in June 1995 or the action
 against two police charged for killing a civilian in June in Kissidougou. Government
 authorities also blocked separate efforts by human rights groups and nongovern-
 mental organizations to investigate political killings in the 1970's under then-presi-
 dent Sekou Toure and to protect victims' burial plots from urban encroachment.
 Vigilante action by victims or other sometimes resulted in the beating to death
 of suspected criminals (see Section L.e.).
 b. Disappearance.-In the months after the February mutiny, hundreds of soldiers
 and civilians disappeared during neighborhood sweeps conducted by unidentified
 members of security forces. After interrogations, dozens of soldiers were transferred
 to judicial authorities for legal proceedings related to the mutiny, and in August
 prosecutors released 63 detainees for lack of evidence. According to relatives, human
 rights groups, and the independent press, dozens-perhaps hundreds-of soldiers,
 civilians, and relatives of accused mutineers remained missing. The newspaper
 L'Independant reported that unidentified government authorities detained numer-
 ous relatives of alleged mutiny ringleader, Major Gbago Zoumanigui, missing since
 February and presumed to have fled the country. Most of Zoumanigui's family were
 released, but one relative, Baba San, remained missing.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Penal Code and the Constitution prohibit torture and cruel, inhuman, or de-
 grading treatment. However, both civilian and military security forces often use
 beatings to extract confessions and employ other forms of brutality, including hold-
 
 
 ing prisoners incommunicado without charges and under inhuman conditions. There
 were no reported judicial proceedings against officers suspected in these abuses.
 Unidentified uniformed personnel used beatings, unsanitary conditions, and re-
 strictions of food in secret prisons to obtain confessions from those suspected of in-
 volvement in the mutiny (see Section 1.d.).
 Prison conditions are inhuman and life threatening. Family members and friends
 are responsible for feeding prisoners. Standards of sanitation remained poor, and
 there were several dozen deaths due to malnutrition and disease. Prisoners report
 threats and harassment by guards. There are credible reports from prisoners that
 female inmates are subject to harassment and sexual assault by guards.
 The Guinean Organization for the Defense of Human and Citizen Rights (OGDH)
 determined that prisoners in at least one major prison, located in N'zerekore, suf-
 fered more from neglect and lack of resources than from mistreatment. According
 to the OGDH, the N'zerekore prison is a converted grain warehouse built in 1932
 for 70 prisoners, but currently houses 120. There is no electricity or running water.
 The newly appointed Minister of Justice made televised visits to prisons in August
 and denounced the inhuman conditions. In June the Government authorized the cre-
 ation of two nongovernmental organizations dedicated to ensuring prisoners' rights
 and prison conditions.
 The Government occasionally permits prison visits by local human rights organi-
 zations.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Penal Code provides procedural safe-
 guards for detainees. In practice, however, administrative controls over the police
 are ineffective, and security forces rarely follow the Penal Code; arbitrary arrest re-
 mained a persistent threat.
 The Penal Code requires that detainees must be charged before a magistrate
 within 72 hours. Once charged, the accused may be held until the final outcome of
 the case, including a period of appeal. Release on bail is at the discretion of the
 magistrate who has jurisdiction. The Constitution proscribes incommunicado deten-
 tion. The law provides for access by attorneys to their clients, but authorities fre-
 quently do not respect this provision.
 From February through June, unidentified security forces detained hundreds of
 soldiers and civilians suspected of involvement in the February mutiny. Judicial au-
 thorities denied any responsibility for the arrests, yet took custody of dozens of de-
 tainees transferred by security forces. Bar Association attorneys, the independent
 press, and government sources described a parallel system of justice run by uniden-
 tified uniformed personnel who conducted midnight arrests, detained suspects, and
 used torture in secret prisons to obtain confessions before transferring detainees to
 prosecutors.
 In August a government prosecutor released 63 detained soldiers for lack of evi-
 dence. The Government had charged a total of 43 soldiers with murder, looting,
 armed robbery, and abandonment of post in connection with the February mutiny
 and detained the rest without charges. The Government said that three unnamed
 soldiers remained in custody while human rights groups, the independent press, and
 government officials credibly reported that hundreds of soldiers and civilians were
 being detained illegally and without charges.
 In September 1995, police in N'zerekore detained between 200 and 300 activists
 from the Rally of the Guinean People (RPG) party, following the killing of a police
 officer during an RPG demonstration that turned violent. According to credible re-
 ports, some of those detained were suspected in the killing; hundreds of others were
 detained for being RPG members or sympathizers. Most were subsequently released
 without charge, throughout much of the year 35 remained in detention without
 charges. The 35 were detained in military barracks, but human rights groups hesi-
 tated to demand that the detainees be turned over to judicial authorities for fear
 that they would suffer greater harm under the inhuman conditions of state-run pris-
 ons. In October 1996 most of the 35 were released with no further punishment than
 time served.
 In December 1994, members of the presidential guard arrested, beat, and de-
 tained the U.S. Embassy React Team--composed of four Guinean employees-who
 were responding to a call by an American citizen for assistance. The team was de-
 tained for 12 days until the four were released without being charged with a crime.
 No action was taken against the members of the guard who were involved, and the
 Government has not returned the equipment that the guards seized.
 The Government does not practice forced exile.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution provides for the judiciary's inde-
 pendence; however, the judiciary is susceptible to executive influence, particularly
 in politically sensitive cases. Magistrates are civil servants with no guarantee of
 tenure and are susceptible to influence by the executive branch. Judicial authorities
 
 
 often defer to central authorities in politically sensitive cases. Due to corraption and
 nepotism in the   diciary, relatives of influential members of the Government are
 virtually above the law. The Cabinet appointed in July stated that it will pursue
 those who violate the law but avoid punishment due to judicial corruption, including
 autonomous Red Berets. By year's end, no action had been taken.
 The Judiciary includes courts of first instance, two Courts of Appeal, and the Su-
 preme Court, the court of final appeal. There is also a State Security court, but it
 has not met since the trial of those allegedly involved in a 1985 coup attempt. Since
 1988 civilian courts have rendered all judgments involving civilians under the Penal
 Code. A military tribunal prepares and adjudicates charges against accused military
 personnel, to whom the Penal Code does not apply. The armed services, however,
 made no use of a tribunal following the February mutiny and transferred dozens
 of detained soldiers to the judiciary (see Section 1.). The Government announced
 in September the creation of a Discipline Council for dealing with civil servants who
 abuse their positions as government employees.
 The Penal Code provides for the presumption of innocence of accused persons, the
 independence of judges, the equality of citizens before the law, the right of the ac-
 cused to counsel, and the right to ap peal a judicial decision. Although in principle
 the Government is responsible for funding legal defense costs in serious criminal
 cases, in practice it rarely disburses these funds. The attorney for the defense fre-
 quently receives no payment. The Government provided counsel for dozens of sol-
 diers charged in connection with the February mutiny and the quasi-independent
 Bar Association started a permanent legal defense fund.
 Defense lawyers for soldiers detained in connection with the February mutiny
 complained that they had difficulty obtaining permission to meet with their clients,
 that prison guards eavesdropped on their conversations, denied family visits for the
 detainees, and that the Government cut their clients' salaries up to 60 percent to
 pay for prison meals.
 In addition to corruption and nepotism, the administration of justice is plagued
 by numerous other problems, including shortages of magistrates (who generally are
 poorly trained) and lawyers, and the outdated and overly restrictive Penal Code.
 A traditional system of justice exists at the village or urban neighborhood level.
 Litigants present their civil cases before a village chief, a neighborhood leader, or
 a council of wise men. The dividing line between the formal and informal justice
 systems is vague, and a case may be referred from the formal to the traditional sys-
 tem to ensure compliance by all parties. Similarly, if a case cannot be resolved to
 the satisfaction of all parties in the traditional system, it may be referred to the
 formal system for adjudication. The traditional system discriminates against women
 in that evidence given by women carries less weight.
 Suspected criminals, notably thieves and rapists, are sometimes beaten to death
 by their victims or by others. Police authorities rarely intervene to rescue victims
 of vigilante justice.
 The Government conducted a mid-year public awareness campaign on justice,
 using the government-controlled media to inform citizens of their rights. The cam-
 paign also included theatrical performances in French and in local languages to dis-
 seminate information on constitutional rights and judicial procedures.
 The Government holds less than a dozen political prisoners. These prisoners are
 individuals incarcerated for allegedly politically motivated acts, such as protests,
 meetings and campaigns; but arrested and convicted under criminal laws such as
 those applying to creating disorder, inciting violence, and corruption. Some of these
 individuals consequently received disproportionately harsh punishment due to their
 political affiliation.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution provides for the inviolability of the home, and judicial search warrants
 are required by law. However, police frequently ignore these procedures. Police and
 paramilitary police often ignore legal procedures in the pursuit of criminals and fre-
 quently detain private citizens at nighttime roadblocks in order to extort money. It
 is widely believed that security officials monitor mail and telephone calls.
 Local businesses, especially expatriate companies, often complain of intimidation
 and harassment by publi offias and authorities. Family members of alleged mili-
 tary mutineers reported harassment, arbitrary arrest, and searches.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.--The Constitution provides for freedom of expres-
 sion, subject to certain limitations; however, despite government statements in sup-
 port of free speech and a free press, the Government employs a broad range of re-
 strictions that vitiate any real protection. The Government prohibits what it consid-
 ers seditious talk or chants in public, has established defmation and slander as
 
 
 122
 criminal offenses, and prohibits communications that personally insult the Presi-
 dent, or incite violence, discrimination, or hatred, or that disturb the public peace.
 The Government publishes the official newspaper, Horoya, and operates official
 television and radio (RTG). Reporters for the official press, who are government em-
 ployees, practice self-censorship in order to protect their jobs. Several younger
 broadcast journalists reported critically about the Government and posed critical
 questions at official press conferences.
 There is a vocal independent press which is critical of the President and the Gov-
 ernment. For example, the weely satirical newspaper Le Lynx publishes front page
 cartoons lampooning the Head of State and senior government officials. The govern-
 ment-controlled daily (Horoya) 'and two weekly    newspapers (Le Lynx     and
 L'Independant) publish regularly in Conakry and up to 10 other publications pub-
 lish sporadically, although hampered by technical and financial difficulties. One
 newspaper, L'Espoir, is affliated with the governing political p arty (PUP) and sev-
 eral other newspapers are affiliated with opposition parties. Other papers offer news
 and criticism of both the Government and he opposition.
 The Government maintains control of the electronic media, and national radio
 serves as the most important means of reaching the public. French radio (RFI) is
 accessible on FM radio in Conakry and in September the Government authorized
 the FM transmission of Africa Number One, a private Gabonese radio station. Many
 Guineans listen regularly to foreign-origin shortwave radio and some Guineans have
 access to foreign-television satellite broadcasts.
 The Government has occasionally arrested journalists. In March the Government
 arrested the editor of Le Lynx, Souleymane Dialo, for publishing what authorities
 called falsification of an official document listing armed forces salaries. On March
 28, a Conakiy court declared Diallo innocent for lack of sufficient evidence; however,
 the Government prosecutr did not release him until April 2. Authorities arrested
 and onvited Duibo in 1995 for offending the Head of State after Le Lynx published
 a cartoon mocking one of President Conte's wives.
 In May authorities arrested Le Citoyen's editor, Thierno Sadou, and in June its
 publisher, Siaka Kouyate, for publishing articles concerning the February mutiny
 and the theft of classified presidential documents. They were detained until August,
 when a ConFM judge convicted them for offending the Head of State and refusing
 to disclaim the artile. They received a suspended sentence, a $500 fine and the
 jude suspended L Cityen from publishing or 2 months. Le Cityen resumed pub-
 On uly 2, the Government deported Serge Daniel, an RFI correspondent and citi-
 zen of Benin, for disseminating negative news. Among other items Daniel had riled
 a report announcing that nearly $500,000 was missing from a Ministry of Health
 pro ect funded by the U.N. Childrens Agency (UNICEF).
 1Political tracts occasionally circulate in Conakry and other urban areas. Some
 tracts support the Government while others specifically criticize senior officials. For-
 eign publications, some of which criticize the Government, are often available.
 TIhe Ministry of National Education and Seientific Research exercises limited con-
 trol over academic freedom through its influence on faculty hiring and control over
 curriculum. In general teachers are not subject to classroom censorship.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The law restricts freedom of
 assembly and the Government exercises its power to thwart unwanted political ac-
 tivity. The Penal Code bans any meeting that has an ethnic or racial character or
 any~ gathering "whose nature threatens national unity." Public gatherings are legal
 ond if the Government receives notification 72 hours prior to the event.
 he Government bans all street marches except For funerals. Pursuant to this
 statute, local authorities may cancel a demonstration or meeting if they believe that
 it will threaten public order. They may hold event organizers criminally liable if vio-
 lenc or destruction of property ensues.
 Students at the University of Conakry went on strike in April and May demand-
 ing an increase in their scholarship payments. As a result of the strike, the stu-
 dents' demands were partially met. During this strike, police broke up a demonstra-
 tion and arrested 22 students and a journalist from La Lynx. La Lynx reported that
 its journalist was beaten in custody but later released. The Government released 13
 of the students for lack of evidence and convicted 9 for inciting violence and destruc-
 tion of property. Th~ey were sentenced to 18 months' imprisonment (which was sus-
 pended) and fined $77 each. Freedom of association is protected by law, but there
 are cumbersome requirements to obtain government recognition. Political parties
 must provide information on their founding members and produce internal statutes
 and political platforms consistent with the Constitution be ore the Government rec-
 ognizes them. There are approximately 46 legally recognized political parties; depu-
 ties of 9 different parties are represented in the National Assembly.
 
 
 123
 There were credible reports of harassment and oppression of the Rally of the
 Guinean People (RPG) party. In January the prefect of Kouroussa blocked two RPG
 National Assembly deputies from meeting in his district with party members. The
 RPG and human rights groups claimed that government authorities physically har-
 assed Kouroussa citizens who did not vote for the government party, as well as RPG
 deputies traveling in Banankoro in August. The RPG and independent press re-
 ported that security forces harassed RPG leader Alpha Conde with tear gas and
 tanks at his Conakry residence.
 c. Freedom of Reion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of religion and
 permits religious communities to govern themselves without state interference. The
 Government generally respects these rigts inpractice. Foreign missionaries and
 church-affliated relief agencies operate reely.  e Government and the quasi-gov-
 ernmental National Islamic League have spoken out against the proliferation of Shi
 'ite fundamentalist sects, which they alleged were "generating confusion and devi-
 ation" within Guinean Islam, but have not restricted these groups.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Constitution provides citizens with the right to travel freely within
 the country and to change their place of residence and work. The Government re-
 quires all citizens to carry a national identification card, which they must present
 on demand at security checkpoints. Travelers face harassment by police and at mili-
 tary roadblocks, particularly late at night. It is common to pay bribes at these road-
 blocks.
 The Government permits foreign travel, although it retains the authority to limit
 it for political reasons. The Government officially closed the borders during the De-
 cember 1995 foreign ministers' meeting of the Organization of the Islamic Con-
 ference. In August commerce authorities restricted overland trade of some products
 in an effort to improve tax collection.
 The Government cooperates fully with the United Nations High Commissioner for
 Refugees (UNHCR), the World Food Program, other humanitarian organizations,
 and donor countries to assist refugees. The Government provides first asylum in ac-
 cordance with United Nations and Organization of African Unity conventions. In
 1996 the Government provided first asylum for over 600,000 Liberian and Sierra
 Leonean refugees, including additional arrivals who fled renewed fighting in Libe-
 ria. There were no reports of forced return of persons to a country where they feared
 persecution.
 The Government has provided school buildings, access to local medical facilities,
 and land for farming to assist those designated as refugees. However, relief organi-
 zations report that government authorities have demanded portions of donated fuael
 and food from delivery convoys.
 While the Government has generally been hospitable toward refugees, there have
 been reports that local police and border patrol soldiers harassed refugees and de-
 manded bribes or sexual favors for entry into Guinea. In reaction to violent Liberian
 rebel incursions in the Macenta forest region, which resulted in the death of dozens
 of Guinean and Liberian refugees, the Government increased its armed forces along
 the Liberian border in July and fought Liberian rebels.
 There were no reports of forced repatriation.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Although the 1990 Constitution provides for a popularly elected president and a
 multiparty parliament, the ability of citizens to exercise effectively this provision is
 restricted. The Government's tight control of the electoral process and lack of an
 independent electoral oversight mechanism call into serious doubt the ability of citi-
 zens to change the Government. The scheduled 1995 legislative elections in
 Kissidougou and Kaloum-Conakry did not take place. During the April session of
 the National Assembly, a majority of deputies rejected the then Minister of Interi-
 or's efforts to appoint, rather than elect, neighborhood councils; however, no elec-
 tions were sche uled.
 President Conte took office in 1994 after multiparty elections in December 1993
 in which the Government dominated the electoral process. In 1995 the President's
 party, the Party of Unity and Progress, won 62 percent of the legislative seats (one
 seat short of the majority required to make constitutional amendments) and 56 per-
 cent of the municipal vacancies. The International Commission of Jurists reported
 seeing no seals on the legislative ballots, results envelopes left open, and various
 means of intimidation used at some polling places. The African-American Institute
 said that the National Electoral Commission-the supposed "moral guarantor of
 electoral fairnes'-had only a marginal role.
 
 
 124
 Opposition leaders deemed the entire precess an "electoral masquerade- and "a
 comedy," and oenly questioned the credibility and legitimacy of PUP's municipal
 and legislative landslide victories. Shortly after results were announced, nine oppo-
 sition parties joined forces to form an umbrella organization, CODEM, dedicated "to
 act, organize, and combat together to make Guinea a land of liberty." These parties'
 deputies took their seats in the National Assembly and played an active role in
 budgetary and general sessions. Government radio and television provided live cov-
 erage of some legislative sessions.
 Women are underrepresented in the Government. The President appointed a new
 Cabinet in July and reduced the number of women who hold positions in the 23-
 member Cabinet from 4 to 2. The women head the low profile ministries of Social
 Affairs and Youth, Sports, and Civic Education. There are only 9 female deputies
 in the 114-member National Assembly. There are few women at senior levels below
 minister and no women among senior military ranks. Women also play a minor role
 in the leadership of the major political parties.
 The Cabinet and armed forces leadership include representatives of all major eth-
 nic groups. However, a disproportionate number of senior military officers are
 Soussou, the President's ethnic group.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Local nongovernmental organizations (NGO's) primarily interested in human
 rights issues include: The Guinean Organization for the Defense of Human Rights;
 the Guinean Human Rights Association; the Children of the Victims of Camp Boiro;
 S.OS. Burial Grounds; the Association of Victims of Repression; Humanitarian As-
 sistance for Prisons; Defense of Prisoners' Rights; Women Jurists for Human Rights;
 the Committee for the Defense of Civic Rights; and the Coordinating Committee on
 Traditional Practices Affecting Women's and Children's Health. Government officials
 are generally cooperative and responsive to their views; however, various officials
 have blocked private efforts to memorialize victims of the Skou Toure regime.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution states that all persons are equal before the law regardless of
 gender, race, ethnicity, language, beliefs, political opinions, philosophy, or creed, but
 the Government does not uniformly enforce these provisions.
 Women.-Violence against women is common, although estimates differ as to the
 extent of the problem. Wife beating is a criminal offense and constitutes grounds
 for divorce under civil law; however, police rarely intervene in domestic disputes.
 Although the Government has made regular statements in the media against sex-
 ual harassment, women working in the formal sector in urban areas complain of fre-
 quent sexual harassment. Refugees from Liberia and Sierra Leone report that some
 Guinean soldiers demand sex in exchange for entry into Guinea. There are credible
 reports from prisoners that female inmates are subject to harassment and sexual
 assault by guards. The social stigma attached to rape prevents most victims from
 reporting it. The Government has not vigorously pursued criminal investigations of
 alleged sexual crimes.
 The Constitution provides for equal treatment of men and women, and the Min-
 istry of Social Affairs and Women's Protection works to ensure such equality.
 Women face discrimination, however, particularly in rural areas, where opportuni-
 ties for women are limited by custom and the demands of child-rearing and subsist-
 ence farming. Women are not denied access to land, credit, or businesses, but
 women receive less inheritance. Evidence given by women carries less weight than
 that given by men (see Section 1.c.). The Government has affirmed the principle of
 equal pay for equal work, but in practice, women receive less pay than men in most
 equally demanding jobs. According to a 1995 United Nations Development Program
 report, only 11 percent of females receive as much schooling as males and women
 constitute 38 percent of the labor force.
 Children.-The Constitution provides that the Government has a particular obli-
 gation to protect and nurture the nation's youth, and the Government allocates a
 siguificant percentage of the budget to primary education. The President appoints
 a cabinet minister to defend women's and children's rights and a Minister of Youth.
 Female genital mutilation (FGM), which is widely condemned by international
 health exports as damaging to both physical and psychological health, is practiced
 in all regions and among al religious and ethnic groups. FGM is performedon girls
 and women between the ages of   an  70. GM is illegal under Article 265 of the
 Penal Code and senior officials have spoken out against the practice. According to
 an independent expert, between 70 and 90 percent of females have undergone this
 
 
 procedure. Infibulation, the most dangerous form of FGM, is practiced in the Forest
 region. Despite efforts by proponents of women's rights to call attention to the prac-
 tice, and in spite of diseases resulting from crude and unsanitary surgical instru-
 ments and deaths resulting from the practice, the tradition continues, seriously af-
 fecting women's lives. The Government has made efforts to educate health workers
 on the dangers of this procedure and supports the efforts of the Committee on Tra-
 ditional Practices Affecting Women and Children (CPTAFE), an NGO dedicated to
 eradicating FGM. An increasing number of men and women oppose the practice.
 Prostitution exists in the informal economic sector and employs girls as young as
 10. The Government takes prohibitive action if prostitution of minors is brought to
 its attention, but does not actively monitor child or adult prostitution.
 People With Disabilities.-The Constitution provides that all persons are equal be-
 fore the law. There are no special constitutional provisions for the disabled. The
 Government has not mandated accessibility for the disabled, and few disabled peo-
 ple work. Many disabled persons develop opportunities in the informal sector.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-    e the Constitution and the Penal Code
 prohibit racial or ethnic discrimination, ethnic identification is strong. Mutual sus-
 picion affects relations across ethnic lines, in and out of government. Promotions to
 senior government levels and the highest military ranks below the President include
 representatives of all three major ethnic groups.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution provides for the right of employees
 to form independent labor unions and prohibits discrimination based on union affili-
 ation. Only an estimated 5 percent of the work force is unionized. Most union mem-
 bers are government employees, employees of the national utilities (electric, water,
 and telephone companies), or of foreign-controlled companies.
 The Labor Code states that all workers, except military and paramilitary person-
 nel, have the right to create and participate in organizations that defend and de-
 velop their individual and collective rights as workers. It requires elected worker
 representatives for any enterprise employing 25 or more salaried workers.
 The National Confederation of Guinean Workers (CNTG) was the sole trade union
 before the Labor Code was enacted. Although there are now other trade unions and
 labor confederations, the CNTG remains the largest confederation.
 The CNTG is indirectly funded by the State, although dissident members seek to
 increase the Confederation's freedom from government control. Independent unions
 and confederations have gained popularity, such as the Free Union of Teachers and
 Researchers of Guinea and the National Organization for Free Trade Unions of
 Guinea. Several disgruntled groups within the CNTG left the Confederation, citing
 corruption in its leadership. These groups joined with some independent unions to
 form the United Syndicates of Guinean Workers.
 The Labor Code grants salaried workers, including public sector civilian employ-
 ees, the right to strike 10 days after their representative union makes known its
 intention to strike. It prohibits strikes in sectors providing "essential services" (hos-
 pitals, radio and television, army, and police).
 Unions may freely affiliate with international labor groups. The Government con-
 tinues to designate CNTG to represent workers in the International Labor Organi-
 zation conference.
 Guinea's largest educators' union, SLECG, held a nonviolent strike in December
 1995 to protest low salaries and poor benefits. The strike had wide participation in
 Conakry and several cities in the interior. High school students clashed with police
 and authorities arrested the union's Secretary General, Louis M'Bemba Seumah,
 and numerous union members. In January a Conakry court convicted seven union
 members for inciting violence and gave them 1-year suspended sentences.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Under the Labor Code, rep-
 resentative workers' unions or union groups may organize in the workplace and ne-
 gotiate with employers or employer organizations. The law protects the right to bar-
 gain collectively concerning wages and salaries without government interference.
 Work rles and work hours established by the employer are developed in consulta-
 tion with union delegates. The Code also prohibits antiunion discrimination. Union
 delegates represent individual and collective claims and grievances with manage-
 ment. Individual workers threatened with dismissal or other sanctions have the
 right to a hearing before management with a union representative present and, if
 necessary, to take the complaint to the Conakry Labor Court which convenes weekly
 to hear such cases. In the interior, civil courts hear labor cases.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Labor Code specifically for-
 bids forced or compulsory labor, and there is no evidence of its practice.
 
 
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-According to the Labor Code, the
 minimum age for employment is 16 years. Apprentices, however, may start at 14
 years. Workers and apprentices under the age of 18 are not permitted to work at
 night, nor for more than 12 consecutive hours, nor on Sundays. The Labor Code also
 stipulates that the Minister of Labor and Social Affairs must maintain a list of occu-
 pations in which women and youth under the age of 18 cannot be employed. In prac-
 tice, enforcement by Ministry inspectors is limited to large firms in the modern sec-
 tor of the economy. Children of all ages work on family farms, in small trades, and
 in the informal sector, such as street vending.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The Labor Code provides for the establishment
 by decree of a guaranteed minimum hourly wage, but the Government has not yet
 done so. There are also previsions in the code for overtime and night wages, which
 are fixed percentages of the regular wage. According to the Labor Code, regular
 work is not to exceed 10-hour  a or     our weeks, and there is to be a period
 of at least 24 consecutive hours of rest each week, usually Sunday. Ever salaried
 worker has the legal right to an annual paid vacation, accumulated at the rate of
 at least 2.5 workdays per month of work. In practice, the authorities enforce these
 rules only in the relatively small modern urban sector.
 The Labor Code contains p revisions of a general nature regarding occupational
 safety and health, but the Government has not yet elaborated a set of practical
 workplace health and safety standards. Nor has it issued any of the ministerial or-
 ders laying out the specific requirements for certain occupations and for certain
 methods of work that are called for in the Labor Code. The Ministry of Labor and
 Social Affairs is responsible for enforcing labor standards, and its inspectors are em-
 powered to suspend work immediately in situations hazardous to health. However,
 enforcement remained more a goal than a reality. Labor inspectors acknowledge
 that they cannot even cover Conakry, much less the entire country, with their small
 staff and meager budget.
 Under the Labor Code, workers have the right to refuse to work under unsafe con-
 ditions without penalty.
