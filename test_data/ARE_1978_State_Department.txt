 UNITED ARAB EMIRATES
 
 The United Arab Emirates (UAE), formed in 1971 when
 the longstanding British protective relationship with
 so-called "Trucial States" ended, is a federation of
 seven small shaikhdoms along the coast of the Persian
 Gulf and the Gulf of Oman. The population of the UAE
 is approximately 800,000, only about thirty to forty
 percent of whom are citizens. The large alien
 population is regarded as a potentially serious
 security problem. The UAE's highest executive and
 legislative body is the Supreme Council of Rulers,
 whose chairma, the Ruler of Abu Dhabi, is also
 President of the UAE. The country's outlook on human
 rights reflects both the Islamic and Bedouin tradi-
 tions of the region and the concepts of the rule of
 law associated with the long British protective role.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 No instances of torture have come to the attention of
 the Department of State. The Constitution provides
 clear safeguards against such practices.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Criminal law in the UAE is still developing. Some
 emirates, notably Abu Dhabi, have been moving toward'
 restoring Islamic legal procedures and penalties in
 the place of practices introduced by the British. In
 part, this trend is a reaction to the still modest but
 rising crime rate popularly associated with the pres-
 ence in the emirates of large numbers of foreign
 workers. Crimes such as rape are now punished by
 public flogging as well as by imprisonment. Prison
 conditions are adequate. The Chief of State, Shaikh
 Zayid, has generally used his powers to commute

 capital punishment to lesser penalties. The
 November 1977 execution of the political assassin of
 a minister of state following the assassin's trial and
 convictimby an Islamic court was an exception.
 c. Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 The law does not prohibit summary arrest or imprison-
 ment, which has occurred in a very few cases involving
 the security of the state. There is no evidence of
 anyone having been imprisoned for political beliefs.
 d. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The UAE's courts provide fair and public trials. The
 judges, mainly drawn from other Arab countries, are
 experienced. Crimes and punishments are defined by
 law and an accused is presumed innocent until proven
 guilty by a court of law.
 e. Invasion of the Home
 While the Constitution guarantees freedom from
 arbitrary search, such searches occur in extraordinary
 circumstances, such as threats to the security of the
 state. For example, such searches were conducted
 after the assassination of the Minister of State for
 Foreign Affairs in 1977.
 2. Governmental Policies Relating to the Fulfillment
 of Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care
 and Education
 The UAE has made a major effort to fulfill the basic
 needs of its citizens for food, shelter, health care
 and education. Expert health care in modern
 facilities is free to all citizens and non-citizens.
 The Government subsidizes all academically eligible
 students from kindergarten through university. Modern
 schools, through the university level, exist or are
 in the final stages of construction throughout the
 
 
 UAE. The level of available women's education is
 virtually on a par with that of men, though classes
 are conducted separately. The UAE Government has
 provided land, and in some cases financial help for
 the establishment of schools for the expatriate
 community.
 While the rapid pace of economic development has led
 to some disorganization in public administration, as
 well as some malfeasance and profiteering, much of
 the Government's energies have been expended on find-
 ing new ways to channel oil revenues to the people.
 The UAE has a small population, the highest per
 capita income in the world, and a strong public
 welfare policy. Therefore, corruption has not
 significantly diverted resources from the poor.
 3. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Includ-
 ing:
 a. Freedom of Thought, Speech, Press, Religion
 and Assembly
 Citizens of the UAE are constitutionally guaranteed
 freedom of thought and religion, in law and practice.
 The UAE media are free to criticize government leaders-
 and have disseminated information embarrassing to the
 Government without suffering retribution. The Con-
 stitution guarantees religious freedom and permits
 churches of various faiths. The Government has made
 land available to Protestant and Catholic churches,
 some of which operate their own schools. The Con-
 stitution guarantees freedom of assembly "within the
 limits of the law." These "limits" are not specified
 in the Constitution. In practice, the authorities
 prohibit, by refusing to issue permits, gatherings
 they consider to be threats to public order.
 Political meetings are unknown in the UAE.
 There is no organized labor movement in the UAE.
 Virtually the entire labor force in the country is
 foreign. Labor organizations are not encouraged by
 
 
 the Government, and there is no provision for labor
 unions in the Constitution.
 The status of most women is still governed by conser-
 vative tribal and Islamic values. Young women
 increasingly are availing themselves of opportunities
 for modern education and are adopting more liberal
 customs. Family and societal pressures, however, still
 tend to confine most UAE women to the home. Liberal
 government policies with respect to women's education
 are contributing to their advancement.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel and Emigration
 There is no restraint on freedom of movement within
 the country. Foreign travel and emigration for all
 citizens are unrestricted.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 In the UAE Federal Assembly, the appointed represent-
 atives of the seven shaikhdoms speak out with impunity
 on political issues, but there is no democratic pro-
 cess for selecting representatives or executive
 leaders. Definitive government structures and prac-
 tices have not yet been shaped because the central
 authority is still in the process of attempting to
 achieve federal unity and arrive at a permanent con-
 stitution.
 In the tribal tradition of the shaikhdoms that com-
 prise the UAE, citizens are encouraged to express
 their views to leaders. Government decisions in the
 individual states are normally made on the basis of
 consultation with leading members of the society.
 Expatriates are expected to desist from political
 activity which in any way would directly affect or
 involve the UAE.

 4. Government Attitude and Record Regarding Inter-
 national and Non-governmental Investigation of
 Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The UAE press, both Government-controlled and
 privately-owned, has given" increasing attention to
 human rights matters, including the publication of the
 1977 report to the Congress on the UAE's human rights
 practices.
 To the knowledge of the Department of State no inter-
 national investigations by human rights organizations
 have been proposed for the UAE.
