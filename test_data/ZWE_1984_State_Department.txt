 ZIMBABWE
 Zimbabwe has a parliamentary system based on the Westminster
 model, as established in the 1979 negotiations at Lancaster
 House that led to independence. Its Government is controlled
 by the Zimbabwe African National Union (ZANU)--led by Prime
 Minister Robert Mugabe--which won an outright majority (57 of
 80 "African" seats) in the 1980 general election. Since
 independence, Mugabe's Cabinet has included members of the
 Zimbabwe African People's Union (ZAPU), led by Mugabe's rival
 Joshua Nkomo, and several whites, who are independent members
 of Parliament. In November 1984, however, Mugabe sacked two
 ZAPU ministers for their party's alleged support of dissidents
 who had murdered several senior ZANU officials, and replaced
 them with ZANU loyalists. Under Prime Minister Mugabe, ZANU
 has stated its intention to transform Zimbabwe into a
 one-party state, with a party broad enough to encompass a
 diversity of opinions.
 Born of a 15-year civil war, Zimbabwe came to independence in
 1980 with a heritage of white rule based on institutionalized
 racial, social, and economic discrimination against the
 majority black population. At the same time, independent
 Zimbabwe also inherited the strongest and most complete
 economic infrastructure in black Africa, mineral resources, a
 strong agricultural base, and a strong manufacturing
 sector--all with significant capacity for growth and for
 amelioration of economic imbalances. In 1983-84 the. growth of
 the economy has been hindered by the worldwide recession,
 continued drought, and internal security problems.
 The present Government has respected the Lancaster House
 Constitution in preserving multiracial democracy and the
 rights of property, but has maintained a legal State of
 Emergency, in force since 1960. These emergency powers allow
 the Government to override constitutional guarantees of
 several basic human rights, such as freedom from arbitrary
 arrest and the right to a prompt and fair trial. They have
 also been used to detain without trial several prominent
 opponents of the Government, including the Prime Minister of
 the predecessor regime, Bishop Abel Muzorewa, and to
 intimidate other political opponents. Government efforts to
 control dissident activity and banditry, concentrated
 primarily in Ndebele-speaking areas, have strained relations
 between the two major black parties and elicited international
 attention due to the substantial violations of human rights
 which resulted.
 There are three branches of the security apparatus: the
 police and its criminal investigation department, which are
 responsible for general criminal cases; the Central
 Intelligence Organization, which is responsible for
 investigating security matters; and the armed forces, which
 have sometimes been assigned responsibility for enforcing
 internal security, especially in dissident-affected areas.
 All three branches have to some degree violated human rights
 during 1984. Most of these abuses were concentrated on ZAPU,
 the ruling party's primary opposition, and its largely
 Ndebele-speaking supporters.
 In February the Government imposed a curfew on a 4,000-square-
 mile area of Matabeleland South province to curb activity by
 dissidents. Despite the curfew and a government-imposed news
 blackout, there were many credible reports that the security
 forces were using unnecessary force and violating the rights
 
 
 389
 ZIMBABWE
 of the inhabitants in their search for dissidents. In June,
 approximately 100 civilians were killed in Midlands province
 during riots by ZANU members against members of opposition
 parties.
 The judicial system continues to function independently of
 government, frequently ruling against the state on sensitive
 issues and defending human rights through the rule of law.
 The opposition political parties--ZAPU, Muzorewa's United
 African National Council (UANC), a splinter ZANU group, and
 the all-white Conservative Alliance--also continue to
 function, although their activities are monitored by the
 security services and their supporters often harassed. An
 independent group of white MP's is also active. Nevertheless,
 Nkomo organized a well-attended ZAPU National Congress in
 Harare in October, and Bishop Muzorewa, after being released
 from detention in September, has held several large public
 gatherings. All parties plan to contest national elections
 scheduled for early next year.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 The Zimbabwe Government continued to face a serious security
 problem in the southwestern part of the country during 1984.
 Targets of dissident attacks were primarily civilians,
 including ZANU party officials, rather than military
 personnel. Knowledgeable sources outside the Government
 estimate that up to 50 civilians died during the past year as
 a result of these attacks. These same sources believe that
 the higher number of deaths for which the Government blames
 the dissidents--over 100--includes murders committed by common
 criminals with no political motivation and Zimbabwean soldiers
 acting within or beyond their orders. At the same time,
 government efforts to cope with the dissident problem resulted
 in the deaths of approximately 100 to 150 civilians, according
 to credible sources. Many of these civilians were being held
 in detention centers under suspicion of aiding dissidents and
 some died as a result of injuries inflicted by the military
 and/or poor conditions at these camps.
 Approximately 100 civilians--mostly members of minority
 parties (UANC and ZAPU)--died in June during anti-opposition
 party demonstrations by ZANU members in several towns in
 Midlands Province. Senior ZANU officials who hold cabinet
 positions have been accused of inciting the demonstrators
 through incendiary speeches. There are also reliable reports
 of their helping to arrange the demonstrations, including
 transport for party youth. Although placing the bulk of the
 blame on the opposition, particularly for the assassination of
 ZANU officials, senior government officials later condemned
 all forms of political violence.
 The Government does not condone the killings of civilians by
 its security forces, but is widely believed to have instructed
 its police to stand aside during the June demonstrations.
 Since then, the Government has arrested four soldiers who are
 alleged to have murdered four civilians in Matabeleland in
 1983 and some ZANU officials alleged to have attacked minority
 party members.
 
 
 390
 ZIMBABWE
 b. Disappearance
 In 1984, sources estimate that as many as 5,000 civilians may
 have been arrested or detained by official security forces,
 mainly in Matabeleland, without public announcement. These
 sources indicate that the Government continues to hold an
 undetermined number of people but that the large majority were
 released within weeks of their arrest. Despite the large
 numbers involved, there have been no reports of unexplained
 disappearances during the past year. Two Zimbabwean rebels
 were sentenced to death in November 1984 for the kidnapping of
 six foreign tourists in 1982 (including two Americans) who are
 still missing.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Minority party members of Parliament and others have accused
 the Government of torture. Reports from a variety of sources
 indicate that Zimbabwean security forces have been responsible
 for a broad range of mistreatment of large numbers of
 civilians--almost entirely Ndebele-speaking--who were
 suspected of being dissident supporters. Types of
 mistreatment included torture with electric shock equipment,
 water, plastic, and chemicals; cruel, inhuman, or degrading
 treatment such as repeated beatings and rape; and confinement
 in small cells with little or no ventilation and detention for
 several days in open-air cages. Reliable sources indicate
 that at least 5,000 civilians experienced some sort of
 mistreatment at the hands of Zimbabwean security forces and
 that between 100 and 150 died as a result of this or other
 poor conditions while in the hands of government forces. On
 the other hand, all detainees are not routinely mistreated.
 Bishop Muzorewa, for example, appears to have been well
 treated and acknowledged this fact publicly after his release.
 In 1984, the Government continued its investigation of
 allegations of abuses during the security crackdown in 1983,
 but its report has not been made public as promised. A
 limited number of the security forces have been brought to
 trial for their alleged mistreatment of civilians, but not,
 according to available information, for mistreatment at
 detention centers.
 Prison conditions in Zimbabwe are spartan but not harsh.
 Diet, clothing, and exercise are governed by regulation;
 deprivation of necessities is not used as a disciplinary
 measure. Living conditions are sometimes crowded, with as
 many as 100 prisoners sharing a large room. Medical service
 is available. Many prisoners are required to do manual or
 farm labor at prison facilities. Much less is known of
 conditions and treatment in maximum security prisons, where
 "security risk" prisoners are confined and in which abuses are
 alleged to have occurred.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Emergency powers have been in effect since 1960. The
 Emergency Powers Act empowers the Home Affairs Minister and
 any police or Central Intelligence Organization official to
 detain any person in the interest of public order and safety.
 "Undesirable inhabitants" may be deported under orders of the
 Home Affairs Minister. A tribunal of independent jurists must
 
 
 391
 ZIMBABWE
 review all detention orders within 30 days. If the tribunal
 finds no merit to the case, the detainee is to be released,
 but the Government can override the tribunal's decision. If
 the tribunal recommends in favor of detention, it continues
 until revoked by the Minister or until the detainee is
 indicted. The tribunal must review all standing detention
 orders every 180 days. The Government has, as a rule, adhered
 to these legal formalities, although there have been some
 delays. A detained person is entitled to hear the reasons for
 his detention not later than seven days after arrest. The
 detainee is also entitled to see an attorney and is entitled
 to compensation for unlawful arrest and/or detention.
 Zimbabwean law provides that an arrested person may demand, in
 court, that evidence leading to his arrest be presented. In
 the case of detention orders, however, the writ of detention
 issued by the Home Affairs Minister has been deemed sufficient
 to meet the requirements for evidence.
 At least 5,000 people are believed to have been detained
 during the curfew in Matabeleland. At any one time the number
 of people under detention has probably averaged between 800
 and 1,200 through 1984. Most of the detainees were never
 formally charged and their detention was never widely known.
 Others, such as UANC leader Bishop Muzorewa--who was held for
 ten months until his release in September--and four leaders of
 ZAPU's former military wing, have drawn considerable
 international attention. The latter remain in detention on
 the advice of the detention review tribunal.
 Between 10 and 20 persons were redetained in 1984 after being
 acquitted in court. Most of those were Ndebele-speakers who
 had been tried in Bulawayo courts. The best known example
 concerns four ZAPU members who were alleged to have been
 involved in an attack on the Prime Minister's residence but
 who were acquitted of charges of terrorism and treason. Tried
 in Harare, they were redetained two days after being
 acquitted. They have since been released.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The constitutional guarantees of a "fair hearing within a
 reasonable time by an independent and impartial court" remain
 in effect and are, in the vast majority of cases, respected.
 Most major cases are held in open court, but an increasing
 number of those on sensitive security matters are being held
 in camera.
 Two major politically sensitive cases that were ruled on by
 the Supreme Court this year reconfirm that the judiciary
 continues to function independently of the Government. The
 Government has made an effort to appoint well-qualified judges
 with experience, even if this has meant recruiting
 expatriates. Several judges have emphasized their freedom
 from government interference in those cases over which they
 have presided.
 Approximately 200 people were tried for "political" crimes in
 1984. Most of them were charged under the Emergency Powers
 Law and Order Maintenance Act for their alleged involvement
 with dissident groups. No more than 10 percent of them were
 represented by counsel.

 392
 ZIMBABWE
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Constitution protects citizens from arbitrary search or
 entry. Under the Emergency Powers regulations, however, any
 police officer may without warrant stop and search any person
 or enter any area where he has "reasonable grounds" for
 believing evidence of a crime may exist and seize the
 evidence. There have been credible allegations of arbitrary
 intrusion into homes and interference with privacy by
 government authorities. Most relate to the conduct of the
 security forces in operations against dissident groups in
 Matabeleland. Well-placed sources have reported that security
 force personnel have employed coercive tactics to persuade
 Ndebele-speakers in Matabeleland to take up ZANU membership.
 There have been no allegations of electronic surveillance by
 Zimbabwean authorities. On several occasions, however,
 Zimbabwean citizens have claimed that authorities have opened
 or confiscated mail.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Although the Government has taken steps to restrict these
 rights from time to time, considerable freedom of speech and
 of the press exists in Zimbabwe. Opposition viewpoints
 continue to be freely ventilated in Parliament, although these
 are not always reported in the press, which generally adheres
 closely to the Government's line. Two prominent exceptions
 are a Catholic Church-sponsored monthly magazine (Moto), which
 often includes articles critical of government policies, and a
 private weekly financial newspaper (The Financial Gazette).
 Criticism of the Government is tolerated, but personal attacks
 on the President are prohibited by law. Senior officials of
 the Mass Media Trust, established by the Government to oversee
 the management of the country's major newspapers, have
 sometimes interfered in editorial policy at the newspapers.
 Two pseudonymous columnists for the major Sunday newspaper,
 who frequently wrote articles critical of the Government, no
 longer appear in print. This has served to reinforce the
 willingness of other reporters and columnists to practice
 "self-censorship" on contentious issues and to stress ZANU
 positions. Nevertheless, it appears that most senior
 editorial personnel generally share and support the
 Government's policies and programs and do not hesitate to
 criticize incompetent or corrupt officials.
 The Zimbabwe Broadcasting Corporation is wholly owned by the
 Government. Although editorial policy is supposed to be
 insulated from politics by a management board, in practice
 both radio and television cleave very strongly to the line
 laid down by the Government and by Prime Minister Mugabe's
 ZANU party, giving prominent coverage to ZANU party rallies
 and meetings, while rarely mentioning those of any other party.
 The Government has relaxed the application of the "Kadoma
 Declaration," which bans entry into the country of journalists
 based in South Africa, but has left it in force and
 occasionally applies it when a reporter requests
 accreditation. During the curfew in Matabeleland South early
 in 1984, journalists were prohibited from entering the area
 
 
 393
 ZIMBABWE
 where the security forces were operating. When they were
 finally allowed into the area, after the partial lifting of
 the curfew, it was as part of an army-escorted tour.
 The University continues to enjoy substantial academic
 freedom, but there are indications the Government is stepping
 up its role in molding university-level courses to fit its
 socialist philosophy. A government-funded "Institute of
 Development Studies" was recently inaugurated to propagate
 socialist philosophy for the country's development program.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Constitution provides the right of assembly or
 association, but there are restrictions in practice. Persons
 who intend to hold public political meetings must obtain
 permission from police authorities or the Ministry of Home
 Affairs. Officials from all major opposition parties have
 criticized the Government for hampering their plans to hold
 such political rallies. According to most observers, the
 record continues to indicate a disproportionately high number
 of disallowed meetings among these opposition groups.
 Some minority party members are increasingly finding that
 their political association carries considerable liabilities.
 There have been credible claims that they and/or their family
 members have been subjected to repeated harassment by persons
 affiliated with the ruling party. In addition, homes have
 been damaged or destroyed by groups of ZANU youths. There
 have also been instances where minority party members have
 been denied access to a variety of public services, such as
 health care or public transportation, or have found employment
 opportunities limited.
 Following the riots in several urban centers in Midlands
 province in June, provoked by the murder of a popular ZANU
 official and his family, ZANU members attacked ZAPU and UANC
 supporters, and the Government placed a ban on all political
 meetings by ZAPU. This ban was lifted in early October.
 Other associations not of a political nature appear free of
 official restrictions and meet openly when and where they
 choose. This includes religious, professional, fraternal, and
 leisure organizations of all types, which flourish in
 Zimbabwe. The Government does not sponsor any so-called
 "mass" organizations aside from its youth and women's leagues.
 The Government has sponsored the establishment of an umbrella
 labor organization, the Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions
 (ZCTU), in order to consolidate the fragmented labor movement
 and bring all unions onto its roster. However, recalcitrant
 unions have shown no eagerness to join the Congress. The
 Minister of Labor recently criticized the Congress for its
 inability to organize itself effectively and for several
 instances of corruption. Proposed legislation to make
 membership mandatory has still not been brought forth. The
 Government has shown caution in using its other powers (e.g.,
 subsidies) to force unions to affiliate with the Congress.
 Aside from the Congress, however, individual unions can be
 effective representatives of their members and have had some
 success in defending members' interests. The Congress
 maintains friendly relations with trade union organizations
 from both East and West. It is also a member of the
 continent-wide Organization of African Trade Union Unity.
 
 
 394
 ZIMBABWE
 There are several professional or trade associations which
 operate effectively on behalf of their members. Notable among
 these are the Commercial Farmers' Union and the Confederation
 of Zimbabwe Industries, both of which have easy access to
 senior levels of government and are respected for their
 expertise. There are no known restrictions on affiliation
 between these or other Zimbabwean organizations and recognized
 international bodies.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Freedom of religion is fully respected in Zimbabwe. There is
 no state religion, nor is any one sect or belief favored by
 government policies. All religious denominations are
 permitted to practice openly and to teach their beliefs.
 Religious groups maintain links with outside coreligionists
 and hierarchies.
 While the ruling party, ZANU, has proclaimed that it intends
 to establish socialism based on Marxist-Leninist principles,
 it has so far taken no steps to restrict religious freedoms.
 There have been several instances, however, when ZANU youths
 have disrupted church services and forced attendance at ZANU
 rallies.
 Methodist Bishop Abel Muzorewa was detained for 10 months
 allegedly for his political activities and suspected collusion
 with South Africa. The Government is suspicious that he uses
 his church meetings as a cover for political rallies. There
 have been instances when members of the ZANU Youth League
 harassed Methodist churchgoers for affiliation with the UANC,
 and the police have not been visibly vigorous in controlling
 such incidents.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Aside from scattered roadblocks or curfews imposed when
 dealing with specific security problems, movement within the
 country is unrestricted, and there are no limitations on where
 one may live or work. The Government has on occasion moved to
 expel squatters in both urban and rural areas when they
 illegally occupy farmland or when their presence creates a
 health hazard.
 The primary restriction on emigration and travel outside the
 country is financial, as the Government limits the amount of
 foreign exchange that Zimbabweans may spend overseas each
 year. There are severe restrictions on the amount of cash or
 valuables, beyond household effects, which may be taken when
 leaving the country permanently. Zimbabwe continues to
 welcome the return of citizens who had been living, studying,
 or working outside its borders. These returnees have been
 integrated back into its society as fast as their skills and
 the community's resources permit.
 In the past year, over 50,000 persons from Mozambique have
 migrated into the eastern part of Zimbabwe to avoid the
 combined effects of drought and political instability in their
 country. At first, many of them were rounded up by police and
 sent back across the border. Since then, however, the
 Government has decided that these persons meet the U.N. and
 OAU definitions of 'refugees,* and camps have been established
 to accommodate them. Most still have family ties in
 
 
 395
 ZIMBABWE
 Mozambique and intend to return there when they can. The
 Government has indicated its willingness to continue to permit
 the Mozambicans to stay until they can be voluntarily
 repatriated. International assistance is being provided to
 them in the interim. There are still reports of Mozambicans
 being turned back across the border, however. On the other
 hand, the Government has successfully applied pressure on
 Zambia and Botswana to return certain Zimbabweans who have
 taken refuge in those countries. In some cases, the
 Government has claimed that the persons involved were
 implicated in criminal activities, although these individuals
 have claimed to the local authorities in their countries of
 refuge that they were wanted only for their political
 affiliations or activities.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Zimbabwe is governed, under a Westminster-style parliamentary
 system, by the Zimbabwe African National Union (ZANU) led by
 Prime Minister Robert Mugabe, which won 57 of the 80 seats
 reserved for blacks in the House of Assembly in the 1980
 general election. The Zimbabwe African People's Union (ZAPU)
 of Joshua Nkomo won 20 seats, and Bishop Abel Muzorewa's
 United African National Council (UANC) won 3 seats. An
 additional 20 seats are reserved under the Lancaster House
 Constitution for representatives elected by the white voters.
 Mugabe included Nkomo and other ZAPU members in his first
 cabinet, but several were expelled in 1982 for alleged
 anti-government activity on the part of ZAPU. Their ZAPU
 replacements, except for two deputy ministers, were sacked in
 November 1984 when Mugabe accused ZAPU of complicity in the
 murder of a senior ZANU Senator by dissidents. The Government
 also includes two Ministers and one Deputy Minister drawn from
 the white community.
 Prime Minister Mugabe, as leader of the largest party, which
 draws its strength from the largest major ethnic group in the
 country, has often stated his desire and intention to
 establish a one-party state in Zimbabwe. While he has been
 careful in the past to couple that statement with an
 affirmation that any such change would be achieved by
 constitutional means, he has suggested that if his party
 should win a massive victory in the next general elections,
 scheduled for early 1985, he would take that as a mandate to
 bring about a one-party state more promptly.
 Zimbabwe has held only one general election, which took place
 immediately before independence in 1980. It was generally
 perceived by outside observers to have been free and fair.
 The next general election is expected to take place in the
 first half of 1985. There have been several by-elections for
 vacated parliamentary seats and municipal elections in 1984
 which have generally been conducted fairly. In the various
 municipal elections, ZANU candidates won in those areas where
 the party is strongest, but they were defeated in
 predominantly-ZAPU Bulawayo, Zimbabwe's second largest city.
 There have been reports of various forms of electoral
 intimidation being applied in more rural areas by ZANU cadre
 or security forces.
 Parties outside government, and some individuals not
 affiliated with any party, have not hesitated to voice their
 opinions on issues both large and small. This is especially
 
 
 396
 ZIMBABWE
 true in Parliament, where there has occasionally been dissent
 within the majority's ranks as well.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Zimbabwe Government is sensitive to criticism of its human
 rights practices. It has failed to publish a report from a
 government-appointed commission of inquiry that was created in
 1983- to investigate alleged human rights violations in
 Matabeleland earlier that year, despite assurances by Prime
 Minister Mugabe that such a report would be made public. The
 Government has also failed to respond to repeated queries on
 alleged human rights violations from non-governmental
 organizations and private citizens.
 Within Zimbabwe, the most notable organization monitoring the
 human rights environment is the Catholic Commission for
 Justice and Peace, which has been in existence for nearly 20
 years. The Commission has been careful over the years to
 speak out about all violations, whether they concern whites or
 blacks, pro- or anti-government persons. It draws its
 information primarily from the network of Catholic clergy and
 laymen throughout the country, but it also receives
 information from persons outside the church. The Commission
 works carefully within the law. The continuation of security
 problems and of human rights abuses in Matabeleland has led
 other church and non-governmental organizations to focus on
 human rights concerns and to question the Government on them.
 Senior government officials in 1983 and in 1984 repeatedly
 failed to respond to requests from the International Committee
 of the Red Cross that it be permitted to visit alleged
 detention camps and at times denied the camps' existence.
 Similarly, the Government has failed to address requests by
 private citizens and other locally based non-governmental
 organizations to investigate a variety of alleged human rights
 problems.
 Amnesty International in its 1984 Report expressed concern
 about the detentions without trial of alleged political
 opponents of the Government, and about allegations of
 torture. Freedom House terms Zimbabwe "partly free."
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 The Government of Zimbabwe has tried to correct the
 substantial imbalance between black and white standards of
 living that existed before independence by providing greater
 opportunities and services to the black population. Whites
 comprise less than 120,000 of the total population of
 8,383,000. Economic and financial constraints have slowed
 government implementation of a number of programs, notably
 land resettlement, but the expansion of health care and
 universal primary education for all Zimbabweans and the
 reduction in income disparities have proceeded steadily.
 Gross domestic product per capita was roughly $713 in 1983 (a
 drop in U.S. dollar terms but a slight rise in local currency).
 Health care available to Zimbabwe's population--growing at a
 rate of 3.3 percent a year--varies widely between urban and
 rural areas. Despite considerable emigration of skilled
 medical personnel since independence, hospitals and clinics in
 
 
 397
 ZIMBABWE
 the urban areas still provide relatively good service. The
 rural population is less likely to have easy access to basic
 medical care, primarily because Zimbabwe still lacks
 sufficient personnel and infrastructure to reach all areas of
 a country as large as Montana. The Government's program to
 expand rural clinics, while it has grown rapidly, is several
 years short of meeting health needs in all remote areas. The
 average life expectancy at birth (1984) is 56.54 years, up
 from 54.41 at independence. The infant mortality rate in 1984
 is 102.40 per 1,000 births (up from 87.3 the year before),
 which probably reflects drought and improvements in the data
 base, rather than a decline in national health standards for
 the newborn.
 Zimnabwe has traditionally been one of the few countries in
 suo-Saharan Africa able to feed itself. Indeed, until the
 major drought, which began in 1982 and has not yet broken, it
 exported and even donated maize to its less fortunate
 neighbors. The nutritional balance is skewed in favor of
 urban dwellers, but barring drought even the rural population
 has access to an adequate diet. In 1982, the Government
 instituted an extensive drought-relief program to provide
 staples to affected rural areas. When the flow of relief
 supplies to some sections of Matabeleland was interrupted
 during the curfew of February-April 1984, it was alleged that
 the Government was using hunger as a weapon to obtain the
 cooperation and political loyalty of the affected population.
 The Government has denied any such discrimination and shortly
 after international attention was drawn to the issue, food
 deliveries resumed. There were no substantiated reports of
 deaths as a result of drought relief shortages. It was
 estimated in 1977 that caloric intake as a percentage of
 requirements was 107.78 percent for the nation as a whole; no
 more recent figures are available.
 The Government currently estimates that there are more than
 2.6 million children in school in Zimbabwe, over 3 times the
 number at independence in 1980. Because of budgetary
 constraints and skills shortages, however, the Government has
 not been able to meet the demand for classrooms and teachers.
 In addition, the Government has had to abandon its original
 intention to make all schooling free of charge and some
 schools, especially at the secondary level, are reinstituting
 fees. Nonetheless, educational opportunities are greatly
 increased over preindependence levels. In 1982 it was
 estimated that 145.66 percent of the children in primary
 school age group were actually enrolled; this oversized figure
 represented children whose schooling had been interrupted by
 the guerrilla war and who had returned to the classrooms when
 the security situation stabilized. The number has probably
 dropped somewhat in the past two years. It was estimated that
 31.2 percent of the total adult population was illiterate in
 1980; since then adult literacy classes have sprung up all
 over the country and the percentage of illiterates has
 doubtless been reduced.
 Despite efforts to clarify and modernize the situation, the
 legal status of women in Zimbabwean society remains
 ambiguous. In 1980 the Government passed the Legal Age of
 Majority Act which gave all women over the age of 18 equal
 legal rights, including the right to arrange their own
 marriages and to own property apart from their husbands. On
 the other hand, the system of *lobola,l or bride price, is
 still the social norm, and the reality of equal rights remains
 
 
 398
 ZIMBABWE
 elusive. A recent ruling by the Supreme Court found that
 fathers may no longer sue for "seduction damages" from a male
 suitor who has impregnated a daughter over the age of 18; the
 woman herself may sue, however. The widespread public
 reaction against this ruling is indicative of the power of
 traditional norms in a society whose government seeks equality
 of the sexes according to contemporary standards.
