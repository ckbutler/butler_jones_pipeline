 MALDIVES
 The Republic of Maldives has a parliamentary form of government
 with a strong president. In practice, government authority in
 this small, homogeneous society rests largely in the hands of
 President Maumoon Abdul Gayoom and a number of powerful cabinet
 ministers. Political parties are not permitted. Candidates
 for the unicameral legislature, the Citizens' Majlis, run as
 individuals. The Majlis selects a single nominee for president
 who is subsequently approved or rejected by the voters. In
 1988 President Gayoom was reelected to a third term. This
 followed his unanimous nomination by the Majlis and subsequent
 approval in a public referendum by more than 95 percent of
 those voting.
 The National Security Service (NSS), which includes, inter
 alia, the army and the police, is responsible for maintaining
 internal law and order as well as defending the country. The
 police division investigates crimes, does other security
 intelligence work, makes arrests, and enforces house arrest.
 The Maldives is comprised of 1,190 islands in 26 natural atolls
 scattered across an area 500 miles long by 75 miles wide in the
 the Indian Ocean. Nearly half the work force engages in
 traditional activities such as fishing and small-scale
 agriculture. Industry accounts for only 14 percent of the
 gross national product. Tourism is the largest foreign
 exchange earner.
 The Government closely restricts human rights in several areas,
 including speech and press, religion, the right of citizens to
 change their government, and women's and worker rights. Other
 problems include instances of arbitrary arrest and
 incommunicado detention and lack of an independent judiciary.
 The dissident press has been eliminated as a result of
 government revocation of press registrations and other actions
 (see Section 2.a.). Some of these restrictions, on religion
 and women's rights for example, are linked with the observance
 of the Shari'a (Islamic law) and with other Islamic principles
 and customs.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 There were no reports of such killings.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reports of disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 There were no reports in 1991 that persons were beaten while in
 police custody. Despite government denials, however, reports
 persisted that some prisoners were being chained and some on
 Dhoonidhoo penal island were being held in solitary confinement
 in cramped chambers. Security authorities say that prisoners
 have the legal right to petition the President to protest
 maltreatment in detention, but there were no reports that this
 right was being exercised. Convicted criminals are flogged
 under judicial supervision when this punishment is prescribed

 MALDIVES
 by the Shari'a. Usually, however, punishment is confined to
 fines, compensatory payment, house arrest, imprisonment, or
 banishment to a remote and sparsely populated island. A bill
 specifying the rights of accused and convicted persons was
 proposed in the Majlis in 1990, was debated once and referred
 to a select committee, but the committee has ceased meeting.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The Constitution states that "no person shall be apprehended,
 except on a verdict specified by Shari'a or (civil) law."
 Police undertake investigations either on suspicion of criminal
 activity or in response to a formal written complaint alleging
 commission of a crime. Depending on the results of the police
 investigation, the Attorney General may refer the case to the
 appropriate court. Complainants may also directly petition a
 court for its intervention. It is customary in the Maldives
 not to disclose to the public the details of.the charges
 against a person until it has been established that the charges
 are likely to hold.
 There is no provision under Maldivian law for bail. Persons
 under investigation generally are free pending trial, provided
 they do not leave a specified island. Depending on the
 charges, however, a suspect may be detained or placed under
 house arrest for 15 days while the case is-being investigated.
 In most cases not brought to trial within 15 days, the suspect
 is freed. Detention or house arrest may be extended after the
 first 15 days by authority of the President, though usually for
 less than a month. There is no requirement in law that persons
 be formally charged before being detained- on suspicion, and in
 some cases, especially political ones, suspects have been
 imprisoned or held under house arrest for weeks or months
 without charges. Some detainees reportedly have been held
 without accesss to lawyers, friends, or family.
 In November 1990, the Government detained more than-50L persons-,
 including a number of journalists, before the opening of the
 summit of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation
 (SAARC) held in Male, the capital. Although some of these
 detainees still have not been charged, the Government says they
 were involved in a plot involving arson and the planting of
 explosives to prevent.the summit from being held. Of the
 arrestees, many have been released; some have have been tried,
 convicted and sentenced to terms of banishment; others remain
 in detention (generally house arrest) awaiting trial. There
 were no cases of foreign exile in 1990. The practice of
 banishment to remote islands is a form of internal exile.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 There is a High Court and eight lesser courts in Male. The
 High Court handles a wide range of cases, including politically
 sensitive ones, and acts as a court of appeal. Each of the
 lesser courts deals with specialized cases, such as debt,
 theft, or property claims. On other islands, there are
 all-purpose courts. There are no jury trials. Trials are open
 to "the public and conducted by judges trained in Islamic law.
 Cases on other islands are usually adjudicated by traditional
 justices of the peace, but those that present complex legal
 questions are referred to the appropriate specialized court at
 Male. The Male court may in turn refer the legal issue to four
 judges attached to the Justice Ministry.
 
 
 1504
 MALDIVES
 All judges are appointed by the President and serve at his
 pleasure; they are not subject to confirmation by the Citizens'
 Majlis. The High Court falls under the authority of the Office
 of the President. Under law, the President has the final word
 in all legal cases, and, according to some reports,
 occasionally has nullified court decisions.
 During trial, the accused may defend himself and call
 witnesses. He also may be assisted by a lawyer, but most
 defendants do not use them because there are few professionally
 trained lawyers in the Maldives. Courts do not provide lawyers
 to defendants who cannot obtain legal counsel on their own.
 Traditional Islamic judges question the concerned parties and.
 attempt to establish the facts of a case as well as to reach a
 legal judgement. Generally, the length and type of sentence
 are established by law and custom.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Constitution prohibits opening, intercepting, reading, or
 making public letters, telephone conversations, telegrams, and
 wireless messages exchanged between persons "except in
 accordance with the specific provisions of the law." There is
 no evidence that the Government monitors correspondence or
 telephone conversations or uses a regular system of informers.
 The Constitution requires that private premises and dwellings
 be respected, but there is no legal requirement. for search
 warrants, and private residences are sometimes searched by
 police officials without prior warning.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution provides for freedom of speech and expression
 "so long as the specific provisions of Shari'a and the law are
 not contravened." In practice, freedom of speech and press is
 sharply restricted. Under Maldivian law and custom, a citizen
 may criticize or complain to the Government without fear if he
 does so through recognized channels. These include letters or
 oral complaints to the President, a Majlis member, a civil
 servant, or other person in authority.
 A provision of the penal code makes illegal those actions that
 arouse the people against the Government. In November 1990,
 the 17th amendment to this law decriminalized "any true account
 of any act of commission or omission past or present by the
 government in a lawfully registered newspaper or magazine, so
 as to reveal dissatisfaction or to effect its reform." It was
 not clear whether this amendment would eventually have any
 impact on government policy toward freedom of expression.
 However, there were reports from a number of sources indicating
 that the detention, harassment, and threats against journalists
 which occurred after a short period of unprecedented press
 freedom in early 1990 eliminated the dissident press and
 created an atmosphere in which many would-be journalists are
 afraid to publish articles critical of the Government.
 Seventy-six newspapers and periodicals are registered in
 Maldives, of which 13 are published by the Government. The two
 dailies (which are reproduced from hand-written originals) are
 owned by government ministers. The two politically outspoken
 newspapers, Sangu and Hukuru, whose official registrations were
 revoked in mid-1990, remain closed. The two journalists
 
 
 1505
 MALDIVES
 affiliated with Sangu who were detained in 1990 (allegedly for
 writing an article and drawing a cartoon critical of government
 officials) are still in detention awaiting trial. One of these
 detainees, Mohammed Shafeeq, reportedly has appeared in court
 at least once after confessing to a fire bombing and other
 attempts to cause public panic and havoc. The editor of Hukuru
 and the journalists taken into custody before the SAARC summit
 in November 1990 have since been released.
 The Government owns and operates the only television and radio
 station. There is no prior censorship of newspapers, but
 officials in the Department of Information and Broadcasting
 sometimes call publishers to point out that certain articles
 are unacceptable for political or other reasons. Publications
 may be banned for containing criticisms of the Government
 "based on falsehood and unfounded speculation." The Government
 also reserves the right to take action against journalists who
 "bring discredit and dishonor to individuals or groups through
 the malicious use of mass media and create social unrest among
 the general public." Because these regulations are sometimes
 broadly construed, self-censorship is well ingrained among
 writers and editors.
 There are no legal prohibitions on the import of foreign
 publications, except those containing pornography or material
 otherwise deemed objectionable in terms of Islamic values. No
 seizure of foreign publications has been reported in 1991.
 Foreign broadcasts are not jammed.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Article 15 of the Constitution (passed in 1932) guarantees
 Maldivians the right to assemble as long as they do not violate
 the law or the Islamic code of behavior. Public political
 meetings are permitted during electoral campaigns, with Home
 Ministry permission, but so far political meetings have been
 limited to small gatherings on private premises. Clubs and
 other private associations are permitted if they do not -
 contravene Shari'a and civil law. They must be registered with
 the Government.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Freedom of religion is significantly restricted. The
 Constitution affirms Islam as the official religion and defines
 all citizens as Sunni Muslims. There are no places of worship
 for the practice of any other religion. Missionaries of
 non-Muslim faiths may enter the Maldives but are forbidden to
 proselytize. Conversion of a Muslim to another faith is a
 violation of Shari'a law and could result in loss of
 citizenship for the Maldivian convert, though law enforcement
 authorities say this provision of the law has never been
 applied. These officials say that no case of a Maldivian who,
 has converted to another faith has come officially to their
 attention. Citizens of other nations resident in Maldives are
 allowed to practice their religion if they do so privately.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Although no law explicitly prohibits migration to the capital
 island of Male or its surrounding atoll, these have become so
 overcrowded that the Government discourages migration there
 except for short periods of work,- education, or medical
 treatment. There are no arbitrary restrictions on foreign
 
 
 1506
 MALDIVES
 travel or emigration. A Maldivian who has acquired another
 nationality must maintain Maldivian nationality concurrently
 and must enter and leave the Maldives on a Maldivian passport.
 The Government is not known to have revoked the citizenship of
 any Maldivian. There are no refugees or displaced persons in
 the Maldives. As far as is known, no Maldivians have been
 exiled abroad or are refugees or displaced persons elsewhere.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Maldivians have only limited and indirect influence on the
 selection and organization of their government. The President-
 and several key members of the Cabinet wield the overwhelming
 preponderance of power. A single nominee for president, who,
 under the Constitution, must be male and a Sunni Muslim, is
 chosen by secret ballot in the Majlis from as many candidates
 as are proposed by members. His nomination is confirmed or
 rejected in a nationwide referendum, also by secret ballot.
 President Gayoom was elected for a third 5-year term by this
 process in 1988, receiving 95 percent of the vote.
 Members of the Citizens' Majlis, a unicameral legislature, are
 chosen for 5-year terms by secret ballot. All Maldivians over
 21 years of age may vote. Of 48 members, 40 are elected--2
 from each of the 19 inhabited atolls and 2 from Male--and the
 President appoints 8. Individuals or groups may freely
 approach members of the Majlis with grievances or opinions on
 proposed legislation. The most recent Majlis election was held
 in November 1989. Under the Constitution, Islamic law rather
 than the Majlis has legal preeminence. The President, in
 addition to being the head of government and state, is
 responsible for the protection of Islam in Maldives.
 While not expressly forbidden by law, political parties are not
 permitted. President Gayoom has publicly discouraged their
 formation, declaring political parties inappropriate to the
 homogeneous nature of Maldivian society, at least for the
 present. In place of political parties, factions in the Majlis
 tend to form around individuals or points of view. Any member
 may introduce legislation. If seconded, it must be considered
 by the entire legislative body. The Majlis may not convoke
 ministers for interpellation, but may send them written
 questions to answer and call for their removal. The Government
 has said that members of the Majlis are protected by law for
 statements made during Majlis debates. However, since the
 arrest of a member of the Majlis in 1990 and the harassment of
 several others for outspokenness in 1990 and 1991, the
 atmosphere in the Majlis reportedly has become more subdued
 than it was in early 1990. Parliamentarian Mohamed Lateef, who
 is widely believed to have been arrested for having spoken
 outside the chamber about a vote of no confidence against the
 President, completed in September his sentence of 6 months of
 banishment to an outer island.
 Legislation proposed in 1990 that would broaden the rights of
 detainees, enhance the legal protection of parliamentarians,
 and amend the Constitution to give the judiciary more
 independence has languished from inattention in the house or in
 special committees.
 Women are not eligible to become president but may hold all
 other government posts. For reasons of tradition and culture,
 however, few women seek or are selected for public office. In
 
 
 1507
 MALDIVES
 1991 2 women served in the 48-member Majlis. There were no
 female members of the Cabinet.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 An association calling itself the Law Society of the Maldives,
 with the professed aim of protecting the legal and
 constitutional rights of Maldivians, was registered with the
 Government in mid-1990 but has not been active.
 According to government officials, no foreign human rights
 group has requested a visit to Maldives to investigate human
 rights conditions. The Government responded to a report on
 Maldives by Amnesty International published in January 1991
 with a letter which complained about alleged inaccuracies.
 As far as is known, the only public request for human rights
 information from an outside organization in 1991 was from the
 U.N. Human Rights Center in Geneva. The Attorney General's
 office says it is working to translate the Criminal Code into
 English in response to the request of the Human Rights Center.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Women by tradition play a subordinate role in Maldivian
 society, although they now participate in public life in
 growing numbers. Because Islamic practice is the basis for
 Maldivian civil law, it is easier for husbands to divorce wives
 than vice versa. Islamic law also governs inheritance. Women,
 who work for wages--for the government, in business, or in
 garment factories--generally receive wages similar to those of
 men in the same positions. Approximately 9 percent of
 uniformed NSS personnel are now female.
 Violence against women occurs in the Maldives, but little is
 known about its extent. Security officials report that they
 receive only three or four complaints of assaults against women
 each year. The Chief of Police appeared on television in 1991
 with a popular female political personality to urge the
 population to report cases of violence against women, even in
 the home. Although this appeal is said to have stimulated the
 reporting of such cases, abuse within the family, such as wife
 beating, is seldom publicized owing to the value attached to
 personal privacy in this conservative society. There are no
 official statistics on the subject.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 There are no trade unions in the Maldives. While unions are
 not expressly prohibited, the Government recognizes neither the
 right to form them nor the right to strike, and strikes do not
 occur.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 Workers' rights to organize and bargain collectively are
 neither recognized nor protected by law. There are no export
 processing zones in the Maldives. Wages in the private sector
 are set by contract between employer and individual employees,
 but are usually based on the rates in the public sector.
 
 
 1508
 MALDIVES
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 There is no legal code in Maldives regulating the conditions of
 labor. Forced or compulsory labor is not prohibited, but there
 are no reports that it is practiced.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 There is no compulsory education law or minimum age for the
 employment of young people. With the exception of a law
 prohibiting government employment of children under the age of
 15, there are no regulations governing conditions under which
 children or young people may be employed. However, most
 employers do not hire young people for work at night or in what
 are considered hazardous conditions. The rapidly growing
 national education system covers most islands and has achieved
 a functional literacy rate of 95 percent in the nation's three
 languages: Dhivehi, Arabic, and English.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 There is no national minimum wage, although the Government has
 established wage floors for certain kinds of work. There are
 no statutory provisions for hours of work and length of annual
 leave. Given the severe shortage of labor, however, employers
 must offer competitive pay and working conditions to attract
 workers. In the public sector, a 6-hour day and a 6-day
 workweek have been established through administrative circulars
 from the President's office. Overtime pay for those who work
 more than a 6-hour day was instituted in the public sector in
 1990. Government workers receive 3 weeks' leave per year.
 There are no laws governing health and safety conditions,
 although the Labor Ministry is now working on a labor code that
 reportedly will include health and safety standards.
