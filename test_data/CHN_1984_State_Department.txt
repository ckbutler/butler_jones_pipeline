 CHINA
 China is ruled by its Communist Party, which reserves to
 itself all power to decide political and economic policy and
 sees itself as the final arbiter of social, cultural, and
 moral questions. The party places comprehensive restrictions
 on fundamental political and civil rights such as the freedom
 of speech, the press, religion, association, and travel.
 Power within the party is shared among a small group of
 leaders in several key organizations, including the Politburo
 and its six-member Standing Committee, the Military
 Commission, and the Secretariat. Despite his semi-retirement,
 Politburo Standing Committee member Deng Xiaoping remains
 China's decisive policymaker.
 When it achieved power in 1949, the Communist Party inherited
 a country with a long tradition of autocratic rule. The party
 has continued this tradition, justified it with Leninist
 principles, and strengthened it through the use of the
 instrumentalities available to the modern state. Any
 alternative to one-party, totalitarian Communist rule has been
 rigidly excluded since 1949. The experience of the Cultural
 Revolution in which the populace (including most of the
 present leadership) was victimized by repeated, violent mass
 campaigns and the country fell into a state of virtual anarchy
 has resulted in a popular desire for order and stability. The
 leadership tries to appeal to this popular feeling by equating
 any perceived threat to its control with a threat to social
 order that justifies a strong reaction.
 Since the death of Mao Zedong and the arrest of the "Gang of
 Four' (Mao's radical followers) in 1976, the Chinese system
 has been in.a period of transition and experimentation. While
 justifying their policies in terms of Marxist-Leninist
 principles and the writings of Mao Zedong and other Chinese
 Communist theoreticians, China's leadership broadly interprets
 these ideological tenets to embrace its pragmatic policies
 aimed at fostering economic development. A commentary in the
 Communist Party newspaper People's Daily in December, 1984,
 for example, noted that the writings of Marx and Lenin could
 not be expected to solve all contemporary problems. To spur
 modernization of this developing country, the leadership has
 progressively repudiated more and more aspects of the Soviet
 economic model. At its October plenum, the party's Central
 Committee approved a massive reform program for industry and
 commerce which aims at loosening planning, rationalizing
 prices, further decentralizing enterprise management, and
 'deregulating* significanb portions of the economy in favor of
 reliance on market forces. Building on successful
 agricultural reforms, the new policies envisage giving greater
 play to individual initiative, while maintaining the general
 framework of economic planning.
 Since the late 1970's, the leadership has instituted political
 measures aimed at rejuvenating institutions ravaged by the
 Cultural Revolution, restoring party prestige among the
 population, and creating stability to facilitate economic
 growth. The legal system, abandoned during the Cultural
 Revolution, has been resurrected, and the authorities have
 promulgated many laws, including the first full-scale criminal
 law and criminal procedure code in the history of the People's
 Republic. The new Constitution, adopted in 1982, provides a
 structure for dispersal of political power within the
 Government--which, of course, remains subordinate to the
 party--and formal guarantees of individual rights. While not
 
 
 732
 CHINA
 relinquishing its decision-making power, the party has made a
 gesture towards broader participation in the political process
 through reinvigoration of the National People's Congress and
 the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, as
 well as by holding multiple-candidate elections to local
 representative bodies. The party has also changed Cultural
 Revolution policies which sought the destruction of religion
 in favor of limited toleration, resulting in some growth in
 officially-sanctioned religious activities, combined with
 continuing restrictions in other-areas.
 Notwithstanding these reforms, the regime does not tolerate
 criticism of the Communist Party or the socialist system, as
 such, and usually deals swiftly and harshly with those who
 cnallenge its basic policies. In 1979-81, dissidents were
 rounded up and imprisoned for publicly questioning the
 established order, quickly ending a brief post-Cultural
 Revolution relaxation of tight controls on freedom of
 expression. Despite the incipient emphasis at that time on
 the rule of law, many of these dissidents were detained in
 isolation for over one year before trial and then convicted in
 closed hearings of 'counter-revolutionary" activities. The
 crackdown effectively silenced the small dissident movement
 and dried up sources of information on human rights
 developments. Although two of these dissidents were
 reportedly released in 1983, the rest remain imprisoned. There
 have been no reports of new arrests of such dissidents in the
 last two years.
 The Government has also moved against religious figures and
 some members of minority groups who have challenged basic
 policies. The authorities have periodically tried to pressure
 worshipers in unsanctioned congregations to join officially-
 recognized churches, and have arrested leaders of such groups
 for anti-government statements or clandestine links with
 foreign missionaries. Several Catholic priests have received
 long prison terms for maintaining ties with the Vatican.
 Despite the leadership's more liberal policies towards
 minority peoples, some Tibetans have been arrested in recent
 years for protesting Chinese control of Tibet.
 A variety of stringent measures has been promulgated by the
 Government to control the country's population growth.
 Although contrary to official Chinese policy, there have been
 numerous reports of coercive birth control practices,
 including forced abortions and sterilizations. Another
 apparent result of the Government's effort to curb population
 growth has been a revival of the traditional practice of
 female infanticide. Senior Chinese officials have publicly
 condemned this practice and insist that it is not'widespread.
 An important part of China's evolution towards a less tightly
 controlled society is the leadership's policy of opening up to
 the outside world. The Government has made the promotion of
 foreign trade and investment an integral part of its
 modernization drive. Travel and emigration controls have
 loosened significantly, as tens of thousands of Chinese go
 abroad every year to study, conduct business, or visit
 relatives, while millions of overseas Chinese and hundreds of
 thousands of other foreigners visit China annually. At the
 same time that it promotes China's opening to the outside, the
 party seeks to block unwelcome foreign influences. Chinese
 contacts with foreigners continue to be monitored by an
 extensive security apparatus.
 
 
 733
 CHINA
 The crime suppression campaign launched in the fall of 1983
 continued throughout 1984, but at a slackened pace. The
 overall rate of executions, while probably much higher than
 before the campaign started, appeared to decline compared to
 the last five months of 1983. The authorities claimed the
 campaign had significantly reduced the crime rate, and that it
 would continue through 1986. Most of those executed were
 accused of serious non-political crimes such as murder,
 robbery, and rape, but a few were given the death sentence for
 spying for Taiwan and for other 'counter-revolutionary"
 offenses. A Public Security Ministry spokesman announced in
 November, 1984, that the campaign had resulted in arrests of
 70,000 persons, while 120,000 criminals had turned themselves
 in. The spokesman said that 70 percent of the crimes involved
 larceny. In a special study of human rights violations in
 China published in September, 1984, Amnesty International
 expressed concern for the extensive use of the death penalty
 and the lack of legal safeguards during the campaign.
 In 1984, the party concluded the first year of its internal
 'rectification' campaign designed to improve the commitment of
 party cadres to the current reform policies and rid the party
 of 'deviant' and unqualified members, including those
 identified with Cultural Revolution excesses. During the
 year, party leaders stressed that the campaign should be
 conducted in an orderly manner and not become simply a device
 for settling old scores. By the end of the year, the party
 had expelled no more than a few hundred members, of whom a few
 were arrested and tried in regular courts for crimes committed
 during the Cultural Revolution. The 'Gang of Four,* including
 Jiang Qing (Mao Zedong's widow) and Zhang Chunqiao, whose
 death sentences were commuted to life imprisonment in 1983,
 remained in jail in 1984.
 In December, China and the United Kingdom signed an agreement
 on the return of Hong Kong to Chinese sovereignty in 1997.
 The agreement included Chinese guarantees for the continuation
 of Hong Kong's social and economic systems as well as specific
 individual rights and freedoms. Chinese authorities claimed
 that Hong Kong would continue to operate as a virtually
 autonomous capitalist entity under the rubric of 'one
 country-two systems," and they explicitly cited this policy as
 part of their efforts to encourage Taiwan to rejoin the rest
 of China in a "peaceful reunification.'
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section I Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 To facilitate the anti-crime campaign, the National People's
 Congress Standing Committee in September, 1983, amended
 existing statutes to increase the number of crimes punishable
 by death and transfer responsibility for reviewing death
 sentences in some categories of offenses from the Supreme
 Court to provincial higher courts. Another amendment provided
 for speedier trials for certain categories of serious
 offenders by waiving the requirement that the accused receive
 a copy of the indictment seven days before trial. Removal of
 such procedural requirements drastically reduced defendants'
 opportunities to prepare a defense or appeal a conviction.
 
 
 734
 CHINA
 At the height of the anti-crime campaign in the fall of 1983,
 for example, two individuals were executed only six days after
 their arrest. The 1984 Amnesty International special report
 on China pointed out that the new provisions applied
 immediately to all relevant trials, which resulted in the
 execution of some defendants for crimes that did not carry the
 death penalty when they had been committed. .
 The vast majority of the 5,000-10,000 individuals estimated to
 have been executed since the crackdown on crime began in
 August, 1983 were charged with serious nonpolitical crimes.
 As in 1983, however, some of those executed in 1984 were
 charged with "counter-revolutionary' crimes.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reports in 1984 of persons being abducted or
 disappearing permanently at the hands of the security services.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 China's code of criminal procedure specifically prohibits the
 use of torture. However, to indoctrinate the public and deter
 crime, the authorities sometimes subject persons convicted of
 serious crimes to public denunciation and humiliation at 'mass
 sentencing rallies.' At these rallies,, often attended by
 thousands of people (including the families and neighbors of
 the accused), the accused are denounced, and their sentences
 revealed to the crowd. Policemen force prisoners to keep
 their heads bowed as a mark of contrition. At the height of
 the anti-crime campaign in 1983, hundreds of persons convicted
 of capital offenses were paraded through cities after the
 sentencing rallies, taken to execution grounds, and shot.
 "Mass-sentencing rallies' continued in 1984, but the frequency
 decreased compared to the outset of the campaign. Despite
 legal provisions that executions not be carried out in public,
 there were press reports of large crowds witnessing some
 executions at the end of 1983.
 Chinese law provides for capital punishment for over 40 types
 of offenses, including crimes not generally punishable by
 death in other countries, such as embezzlement, theft,
 bribery, and pimping. Most of those executed thus far in the
 crime crackdown have been charged with murder, rape, or
 robbery.
 The 1984 Amnesty International special report on China
 detailed allegations of prisoners' ill-treatment, especially
 during pretrial detention. Citing the cases of two
 dissidents, the report mentioned extended periods of solitary
 confinement and the use of hand-shackles day and night for
 weeks. General conditions in prisons and labor camps probably
 vary widely. In prisons visited by foreigners with official
 sanction, inmates live in a crowded but sanitary environment.
 Prisoners are required to work in prison factories or farms
 for six to eight hours a day under strict supervision.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Chinese law details a series of procedures to be observed in
 the handling of suspects, including use of arrest warrants and
 time limits for detention during investigation and trial.
 
 
 735
 CHINA
 There is no provision for preventive detention. Other
 guarantees in the law include the right to counsel. However,
 a defense attorney normally does not enter a case until after
 the police and procurator have finished their investigation
 and the defendant has been formally charged.
 In July, 1984, the National People's Congress (NPC) Standing
 Committee approved amendments extending the period of
 detention during investigation from two to four months and the
 time limit for trials from one and one-half to two and
 one-half months. In principle, these changes applied only to
 .serious' cases and required that extensions be approved by
 provincial procuratorates or courts. Since Standing Committee
 decisions in 1980 and 1981 had granted temporary authority to
 provinces to set their own time limits, the NPC's action
 represented both a return to a national standard and a
 probable reduction in the time limits earlier specified by the
 provinces. The new regulations also authorized the use of
 bail for accused persons not considered *dangerous," but there
 have been no reports about its implementation, notwithstanding
 claims in the Chinese press that these amendments would
 "promote human rights."  It remained unclear how strictly they
 would be enforced since detainees have been held indefinitely
 in the past despite existing legal limits.
 The 1984 Amnesty International special report on China details
 the cases of dissidents arrested between 1978 and 1981, many
 of whom were detained for periods of over one year before
 being tried. They were typically charged with offenses such
 as 'counter-revolutionary propaganda and agitation';
 organizing or taking part in a "counter-revolutionary group,"
 and incitement "to resist arrest or violate the law and
 statutes of the state." Some of these persons were held
 incommunicado following their arrest and their whereabouts not
 divulged. Although family members were eventually notified of
 their arrests, the detainees were not allowed to see their
 family members for a considerable time, if at all. There were
 no reports of such political dissidents being arrested in 1983
 or 1984, but most of those incarcerated earlier remain in
 prison.
 Under 'labor education" provisions, those who commit 'minor
 theft or fraud" or who have been expelled from their work
 units may be deprived of their civil liberties and subjected
 to "education through labor" for up to four years without
 trial. This non-judicial sentencing procedure has been used
 frequently against political dissidents. Judgments are handed
 down by a public security office in consultation with
 representatives of local civil affairs units. The authorities
 made extensive use of this provision during the initial phases
 of the crime suppression campaign in 1983 to round up alleged
 hooligans, many of whom had their urban residency permits
 canceled and were exiled to remote areas. In addition, the
 authorities in 1984 continued to transfer more serious
 offenders (sentenced to "reform through labor") from prisons
 in coastal areas to labor camps in remote areas of Xinjiang
 and Qinghai. Even after they complete their sentences, most
 of these prisoners will be denied permission to return to
 their homes in the East, and will be'expected to find
 employment and establish themselves as permanent residents of
 these underpopulated border regions.
 
 
 736
 CHINA
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 China's judiciary is nominally independent, but in practice
 follows party policy. Although there are not now any standing
 special political or security courts, the party has in the
 past stage-managed trials having political significance such
 as those involving prominent Cultural Revolution political
 figures.
 Most Chinese trials are essentially sentencing hearings where
 defense representatives plead for clemency for their clients
 whose guilt, with very few exceptions, is not contested. The
 trials are preceded by extensive pretrial investigation and
 corroboration of testimony, and it is assumed that any
 individual who is brought to trial is guilty. Defendants in
 criminal cases may appeal both verdicts and sentences to the
 next higher level court. Appeals have resulted in both
 stiffer and reduced sentences for the accused.
 The criminal procedure code requires that all trials be held
 in public, except those involving state secrets, juveniles,
 and *personal secrets.' In practice, attendance at public
 trials requires an admission ticket obtained from
 organizationq selected by the authorities. According to
 Amnesty International's special report on China, most trials
 of those it classifies as prisoners of conscience were held
 without advance notification of their families.
 No reliable figures exist for the number of political
 prisoners in China, nor is there sufficient data to make an
 accurate estimate. For its part, the Chinese Government
 denies that it has any political prisoners and insists it
 imprisons only criminals and 'counter-revolutionaries.' The
 latter group includes some who had no clear political motive
 in breaking the law, but whose offenses (such as jailbreak or
 attacks on public buildings) were nonetheless classified as
 'counter-revolutionary.' Overall, the number of such
 prisoners has dropped since the late 1970's, with the
 'reversal of verdicts' (often initiated through extra-judicial
 channels) of hundreds of thousands of persons sentenced as
 "counter-revolutionaries' during the Cultural Revolution, and
 through natural attrition. However, total inmate population
 in labor camps and prisons has increased since the anti-crime
 campaign, as tens of thousands of common criminals and persons
 considered socially undesirable have been processed through
 the courts. Estimates of outside observers on the number of
 labor camp inmates range from 100,000 to 10,000,000.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Extensive regulation of individual and family life is one of
 the distinctive features of the Chinese sociopolitical
 system. For most Chinese (particularly urban residents), life
 revolves around the work unit, which provides not only
 employment, but also housing, ration coupons, permission to
 marry and have a child, and other aspects of daily life. The
 unit, along with personnel in "neighborhood committees,'
 monitors an individual's attitudes and behavior and may report
 suspicious activity to the authorities. The unit is the
 party's enforcer at the local level, but its considerable
 autonomy may also be used to ignore or obstruct directives
 from the top.
 
 
 737
 CHINA
 The authorities have instituted various controls on marriage
 and childbearing. The minimum age for marriage is 22 for men
 and 20 for women, high by world standards but lower than
 previous Chinese requirements. Each province sets guidelines
 for the desired number of children to be born during the
 year. These guidelines are often translated into rigid quotas
 at the unit level. Women must apply for permission from their
 unit to have a child. Although contrary to announced central
 government policy, many of those becoming pregnant without
 permission are reportedly coerced into having abortions, even
 in the later stages of pregnancy. Chinese authorities say
 they take prompt measures against local officials who violate
 the Government's policy, but there have been few reports of
 punishment of offenders. In public statements during 1984,
 family planning officials defended the right of women to have
 abortions but repeated the Government's opposition to any
 coercion. In July, a family planning official reiterated that
 the Chinese Government does not condone forced abortions or
 sterilizations, but admitted that coercion does occur in some
 areas. According to official Chinese statistics, about
 78,000,000 abortions were performed between 1971 and 1982.
 The'number of female sterilizations was 35,000,000 and the
 number of male sterilizations was 19,000,000 for the same time
 period. Despite government policy opposing coercion, credible
 reports suggest that many of these abortions and
 sterilizations were involuntary.
 Although contacts between Chinese and foreigners have
 increased considerably, the authorities closely scrutinize
 such association. Chinese whose work does not require or
 permit contact with foreigners may be warned or detained and
 questioned if they persist in meeting foreign acquaintances.
 In December, a Chinese citizen who had been sentenced to three
 years of *education through labor" on charges of passing
 documents to an American in China was released in Beijing, six
 months early. The authorities in principle permit marriages
 between foreigners and Chinese, but specifically prohibit
 their citizens involved in confidential and other 'important'
 work (such as diplomats and military personnel), as well as
 those serving prison sentences, from marrying foreigners. In
 practice, romantic liaisons between Chinese citizens and
 foreigners are strongly discouraged.
 The criminal procedure code requires the use of search
 warrants for gathering evidence. There is no reliable
 information on whether this proviso is carried out in
 practice. There have been some reports of the use of
 electronic eavesdropping equipment to monitor suspected
 political dissidents.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Chinese Constitution guarantees freedom of speech and the
 press, but in practice open criticism of the Communist Party
 or Chinese socialism is not permitted. The 1979-81
 suppression of unofficial journals expressing such opinions
 succeeded in virtually eliminating publication of dissident
 views. The party carefully controls the print and broadcast
 media. Degrees of control vary from absolute, in the case of
 party organs such as the People's Daily, to 'guided,' for
 specialized publications dealing with nonpolitical topics.
 
 
 738
 CHINA
 With party sanction, newspapers routinely publish *Letters to
 the Editor' and feature articles exposing incompetence or
 corruption by low- or middle-ranking officials.
 In October 1983, the authorities launched an ill-defined
 attack on *spiritual pollution,' a campaign which eventually
 centered on certain areas of cultural activity and
 intellectual debate. Party officials criticized ideological
 and literary works which manifested Western liberal views,
 questioned party leadership, or were 'pornographic.' By the
 end of 1983, Chinese leaders had reined in the drive, and
 public references to 'spiritual pollution' had ceased by the
 summer of 1984. A national writers' conference opening in
 Beijing in late December gave promise of a more liberal trend
 in official policy towards writers. A Communist Party
 official criticized excessive party interference in literary
 affairs, and said that writers must be free to choose their
 subjects and ways of expression, though he also made it clear
 that criticism of the socialist system would remain off-limits.
 Despite official suspicion of foreign influences, the
 leadership has permitted greater, albeit still limited, access
 to various aspects of foreign culture. More foreign books and
 artistic works are available now than in past years. Selected
 subscribers in universities and other institutions receive
 foreign periodicals. Tens of millions of Chinese read the
 Reference News, an officially-controlled selection of largely
 uncensored translations from the foreign press. Coverage of
 foreign news in the open media has become more extensive and
 professional. Chinese listen freely to foreign broadcasts
 such as the Voice of America (VOA), and many universities use
 VOA and other foreign radio broadcasts in their language
 courses. There is no jamming. Chinese television broadcast
 about 80 hours of the Los Angeles Olympic Games, including
 live coverage of the opening and closing ceremonies. In its
 weekly programming, Chinese television includes some programs
 from Western and other countries; it recently signed a
 contract with CBS for a package of programs and commercials.
 Audiences in some major cities enjoy Chinese-language
 renditions of classical and contemporary Western plays, such
 as Eugene O'Neill's "Anna Christie.'
 In February, the authorities expelled the Beijing
 correspondent of the West German magazine Der Spiegel for
 allegedly smuggling cultural relics. The correspondent
 vehemently denied the accusation and charged the Chinese were
 retaliating for his reporting, which was occasionally critical
 of China.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 China's Constitution guarantees the freedom of peaceful
 assembly and association; in practice, however, the
 authorities severely circumscribe these rights. China has a
 wide variety and increasing number of professional and other
 associations, such as the All-China Youth Federation, the
 All-China Women's Federation, the Chinese Writers'
 Association, and the All-China Sports Federation. These
 groups operate with official sanction and are subject to party
 control. The authorities suppress groups which attempt to
 function independently of their supervision, as they did in
 1979-81 with various dissident groups.
 
 
 739
 CHINA
 Despite claims to nominal independence, China's trade unions
 are closely controlled by the Communist Party. The All-China
 Federation of Trade Unions (ACFTU) is the umbrella
 organization with which all trade unions must affiliate. With
 over 74 million members, the ACFTU enrolls about two-thirds of
 the urban work force. The Federation's prime function is to
 serve the state's interest by promoting labor discipline,
 enhancing labor productivity, conducting political and
 ideological indoctrination, and improving workers' educational
 and technical skills. Unions also perform a variety of social
 and welfare functions such as operating clubs, eating
 facilities, nurseries, schools, and sanatoriums. Their duties
 also include the promotion of workers' safety. Although
 government officials may consult trade union leaders on wage
 policy, unions have no power to engage in collective
 bargaining.
 Chinese workers are not guaranteed the right to strike.
 Included in the 1978 State Constitution, this right was
 omitted in the 1982 revision as well as in the 1983 Trade
 Union Constitution. However, a trade union spokesman said in
 1983 that this omission did not necessarily mean that strikes
 were illegal. He then described a narrow range of
 circumstances. (e.g., workers' safety at risk) where strikes
 might be permitted for a brief time.
 In the last several years, the ACFTU has moved actively to
 expand its international ties. Claiming to have contacts with
 trade unions in over 120 countries or regions, the Federation
 has stated its desire to establish links with foreign unions
 regardless of their affiliation with the International
 Confederation of Free Trade Unions, the Soviet-dominated World
 Federation of Trade Unions, or any other organization. The
 ACFTU's busiest bilateral program is with the Japanese labor
 federations Domei and Sohyo. Since China activated its
 membership in the International Labor Organization in 1983, an
 ACFTU official has served as China's workers' delegate to that
 body. This representative was elected to an alternate seat on
 the ILO governing body in 1984.
 Since 1981, workers' congresses have been established in most
 of China's large and medium-sized enterprises. Created in
 principle to permit workers a role in enterprise management
 and selection of plant officials, the congresses have to date
 been largely ineffectual. The October 1984 party plenum's
 decision on economic reform, while calling for "centralized
 and unilateral leadership" of enterprises and "strict labor
 discipline," also says that worker participation in management
 must be ensured, but no specific steps to accomplish this have
 yet been announced.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Reversing Cultural Revolution-era attempts to eliminate all
 religious practice, China's reformist leadership opted in 1978
 for a policy of limited religious toleration. China's
 Constitution guarantees freedom of religious belief and
 specifies that no organization or individual may compel
 citizens to believe or disbelieve in religion or discriminate
 against them because of religious preference. The
 Constitution also provides that religious bodies must not be
 subject to foreign domination. Aside from these provisions,
 official policy forbids religious proselytizing outside places
 of worship or believers' homes. Unpublished regulations
 reportedly also limit-religious freedom to those over 18.
 
 
 740
 CHINA
 In some areas, religious instruction of minors is forbidden,
 and the young are discouraged from attending religious
 activities. However, this policy is widely ignored,
 particularly in minority areas, where the practice of religion
 is an integral part of daily life.
 The authorities have required all religious bodies to
 affiliate with eight national organizations representing four
 religions--Christianity, Buddhism, Islam, and Daoism. Of the
 five Christian associations, two are Protestant (the
 Protestant Three Self Movement and the China Christian
 Council), and three are Catholic (the Patriotic Catholic
 Association, the National Administrative Council of the
 Catholic Church, and the Catholic Bishops College). Together,
 these associations--with different functional responsibilities
 but overlapping leaderships--constitute the officially-
 sanctioned national Protestant and Catholic churches.
 Although all Protestant denominations were required to merge
 in the 1950's, congregations and individuals may follow
 preferences on such matters as forms of baptism. Since its
 separation from Rome thirty years ago, the Chinese Catholic
 Church has developed an independent theology and doctrines;
 for example, it rejects papal infallibility, continues to
 conduct services in Latin, and supports the state's policy on
 birth control and abortion. These five Christian associations
 and the three organizations representing the other religions
 ensure that religious bodies accept the leadership of the
 state and party.
 Within the limits of official policy, religious activities
 have expanded in the last six years. Many religious
 institutions which were closed during the Cultural Revolution
 have reopened. In 1984, officials said there were 1,600
 churches and over 20,000 mosques in service in the country.
 China's only Eastern Orthodox church reportedly opened this
 year in the northeastern city of Harbin--after being closed
 for 18 years. Many Buddhist and Daoist temples have reopened,
 often after being refurbished with government funds. In
 Tibet, 75 Lamaistic monasteries have been restored, and
 another 125 are under repair--still just a fraction of the
 2,700 monasteries open before the Chinese suppression of the
 1959 Tibetan uprising. Similarly, only a small number of
 monks have returned to monastic life, although more are being
 trained at a government-funded institute in Lhasa.
 Since 1981, the authorities have permitted the establishment
 of seminaries to train a limited number of young people in
 religious orders. The Catholic church has its national
 seminary in Beijing, along with regional schools in Chengdu,
 Shanghai, Wuhan, Beijing and Shenyang. Apart from its
 national seminary in Nanjing, the Protestant church operates
 theological institutes in Shenyang, Fuzhou and Beijing. The
 Islamic Association operates a National Theological Institute
 in Beijing, while the Buddhist Association has institutes in
 Beijing, Suzhou, and Nanjing, as well as Lhasa. The religious
 associations publish a variety of religious materials for
 believers, including scriptures, teaching material,
 theological journals, and hymnbooks. Since 1980, for example,
 the Protestant China Christian Council has printed and
 distributed over 1.3 million Bibles. Aside from appropriating
 funds for extensive renovation of temples, the Government
 provides other forms of direct and indirect financial support
 for religious bodies (e.g., tax exemptions for their rental
 income and cash subsidies to Muslims for observance of dietary
 law).
 
 
 741
 CHINA
 The number of Christians has increased since 1978, with
 estimates of their numbers ranging from the official figure of
 six million to a more likely 10-20 million. Officials say
 there are 15 million actively practicing Muslims and that
 practitioners of Buddhism and Daoism run in the millions.
 This increase in believers has resulted in a severe shortage
 of places of worship, given the continued occupation of most
 pre-Cultural Revolution churches and temples by factories, the
 military, and other units. As a result, many congregations
 are forced to meet in believers' homes. Since the older
 generation of religious leaders is slowly dying off, and the
 number of seminary graduates is still inadequate, there is
 also a pressing shortage of priests, ministers, monks, and
 imams.
 Despite the greater freedom of recent years, the authorities
 still react harshly to unsanctioned religious activity. Some
 Christians prefer to worship outside the officially-recognized
 "patriotic" church system and instead meet in unsanctioned
 'house churches.' The public security authorities have
 harassed these underground churches with measures including
 arrests in an attempt to force worshipers into an official
 church. In 1983, there were reports of arrests of 30 "house
 church' leaders in central China, 100 Christians in Henan
 Province, and two ethnic Koreans active in the Evangelical
 Church movement in Shanghai. In 1983, the National People's
 Congress Standing Committee authorized the death penalty for
 those organizing secret sects which spread 'feudal-and
 superstitious ideas.' However, this provision did not appear
 aimed at mainstream religious activities, but rather at
 traditional animist and cult practices. In July 1984, for
 example, two Hubei residents were executed for organizing the
 'Emperor's Sect", which officials accused of spreading rumors
 of an impending calamity to undermine social order.
 The Chinese Communist Party professes its adherence to
 atheism, and members are in principle expelled for religious
 affiliation. When persons with religious beliefs are barred
 from joining the Communist Party, they are excluded from many
 of the material, career, and other benefits which accrue to
 party members. However, some party members, especially
 members of minority groups, still manage to practice their
 religion.
 Because of concern over divided loyalties, the Chinese
 authorities carefully monitor and control contacts between
 Chinese and foreign religious organizations. On the one hand,
 they encourage Chinese religious leaders to meet foreign
 counterparts and take part in international meetings. In
 1984, for example, the president of the Chinese Buddhist
 Association attended the Buddhist World Fellowship Congress in
 Sri Lanka. Among the many foreign religious visitors
 traveling to China in 1984 was the Philippines' Jaime Cardinal
 Sin, who met with Chinese Catholic leaders. To gain support
 from important minority groups and create goodwill with
 Islamic nations, China in 1979 resumed giving permission to
 Muslim citizens to make the Hajj. Over 1,200 Chinese made the
 pilgrimage to Mecca in 1984, a sharp increase over previous
 years.
 On the other hand, the Chinese Government insists that the
 country's religious bodies must be independent and warns
 against foreign attempts to interfere in Chinese religious
 affairs. The Government prohibits missionaries from
 practicing among Chinese citizens but has allowed some foreign
 
 
 742
 CHINA
 clergymen to enter for brief periods to serve the resident
 foreign community. Foreigners with acknowledged ties to
 overseas religious institutions are permitted to work in
 China, with the understanding that they not engage in open
 proselytizing of their beliefs.
 The authorities' principal concern with alleged foreign
 interference lies with the Vatican. Relations continue to be
 chilly because of Rome's recognition of the Taiwan authorities
 as the "Republic of China" and because the officially
 sanctioned Chinese Church does not recognize the Vatican's
 authority. Chinese priests who maintain their loyalty to the
 Pope are subject to arrest and imprisonment. The most recent
 case occurred in late 1983 when a provincial court sentenced
 the 76-year-old Bishop of Baoding, Peter Joseph Fan Xueyan,
 and his 70-year-old Vicar-General, Monsignor Huo Binzhang, to
 ten years' imprisonment for maintaining links with the
 Vatican. The authorities arrested over ten elderly priests
 and laymen in November 1981 on similar charges; many of them
 had previously been imprisoned for maintaining relations with
 the Vatican. Several members of this group were tried in 1983
 and sentenced to prison terms of up to 15 years. One of the
 priests, Father Zhu Shude, died of natural causes in a labor
 camp in December 1983. Gong Pinmei, former bishop of Shanghai
 and another prominent Catholic clergyman loyal to Rome, has
 been incarcerated since 1955.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Travel within China is subject to various formal and informal
 restrictions. Chinese citizens must have a written letter of
 introduction from their work unit to buy airplane tickets,
 secure hotel accommodations, or acquire ration coupons for
 purchase of basic food items in areas outside their places of
 residence. Those traveling by rail who plan to stay with
 relatives need not obtain letters of introduction but are
 still required to register with local police during their
 visits. With their higher income levels (particularly in the
 countryside), Chinese are traveling ever more frequently
 within the country, sometimes ignoring these bureaucratic
 requirements without much difficulty. This increased mobility
 prompted the authorities, out of concern for social order and
 public security, to announce in April the phased adoption of
 the country's first nationwide identity card system.
 Chinese citizens cannot freely change their locality of
 residence or workplace. They are registered as residents of a
 particular jurisdiction, and the authorities normally grant
 permission to move to another locality only for a change in
 employment. In practice, rigid personnel policies, most
 notably the unwillingness of units to sanction an employee's
 transfer, make it difficult to change jobs. The authorities
 have called for and taken some initial steps towards reform of
 the personnel system, aiming at greater mobility among
 scientists, technicians, and certain other professionals. As
 part of efforts to develop commerce and industry in rural
 areas, the State Council issued a circular in October which
 authorized peasants to establish businesses in rural towns.
 However, strict policies regulating rural to urban migration
 continued.
 
 
 743
 CHINA
 With the relaxation of controls on foreign travel and
 emigration since the late 1970's, tens of thousands of Chinese
 now go overseas every year to study, conduct business, or
 visit relatives. The trend toward looser controls continued
 in 1984. In November, the Government announced that the
 state-financed students sent abroad would be increased by
 1,000 to 4,000 in 1985. In December, some of the restrictions
 applicable to students able to secure financial support for
 studies abroad from non-governmental sources were abolished.
 In 1983, around 30,000 Chinese were studying overseas, of whom
 almost half were in the United States. The U.S. Embassy and
 Consulates in China issued 24,000 non-immigrant visas in
 fiscal year 1984, compared with 16,000 the previous fiscal
 year and rejected applications from more than 5,000 other
 Chinese applicants who had secured Chinese travel documents
 but who were unable to overcome the presumption of the U.S.
 visa law that they were intending immigrants.
 During the same period, close to 13,000 U.S. immigrant visas
 were issued in China, compared with about 6,000 the previous
 year, with over 60,000 applicants currently on the waiting
 list. The Chinese Government has also permitted several
 hundred individuals with dual Chinese-American citizenship to
 leave for the U.S. using Chinese documentation. Other Western
 countries have experienced similar increases in Chinese travel
 and emigration. The trend towards looser controls on foreign
 travel notwithstanding, Chinese cannot go abroad as a matter
 of right. A significant number of Chinese who apply for
 passports are refused, but no statistics are available.
 Chinese permitted to leave the country are allowed to return.
 China does not revoke the citizenship of political
 dissidents. On the contrary, the authorities have welcomed
 the return for permanent residence of Chinese who had fled
 their homeland earlier in fear of Communist rule; such persons
 are also welcomed back for brief visits or to establish
 residence. An estimated ten million overseas Chinese,
 including some political opponents and refugees from the
 regime, visited China in 1984 for business or tourism.
 Since 1978, over 270,000 refugees from Vietnam and Laos--most
 of them ethnic Chinese--have resettled in China. The vast
 majority of these refugees arrived before 1980; the number of
 new arrivals has dropped to around 100 per month in the last
 two years. Since 1983, the authorities have also resettled
 over 2,000 ethnic Chinese permanent residents of the Mongolian
 People's Republic, who were expelled by that country's
 Government. There were no known cases of forced repatriation
 of refugees, nor have the authorities sought to obstruct
 voluntary repatriation or resettlement abroad by refugees.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) is the unchallenged source
 of political authority and decision-making in the country.
 Within the party, power is divided among a group of top
 leaders in several key organizations, including the Politburo
 and its six-member Standing Committee, the Military
 Commission, and the Secretariat. The latter body has become
 increasingly dominant in policy formulation. Under the
 doctrine of 'Democratic Centralism," these leaders at the top,
 after consultation within the party, make policy decisions
 which all party members are expected to support. Since this
 
 40-387 0 - 85 - 48
 
 
 744
 CHINA
 doctrine demands strict discipline, political debate and
 conflict can take place only through informal mechanisms or
 behind closed doors. Such mechanisms used by influential
 party members include the presentation of alternate points of
 view or criticism through thinly veiled allusions in the
 party-controlled press, selective enforcement of policies,
 exploitation of policy ambiguities, manipulation of news
 coverage, and informal and unpublicized debate at party and
 government meetings. Parties or groups which oppose the party
 or its policies are forbidden. Over the past five years,
 however, the CCP has promoted a modest rejuvenation of eight
 'democratic* parties (formed before 1949) as agents of its
 'United Front" policy. Admittedly subservient to the
 Communists, the parties function as channels through which the
 authorities seek to mobilize support aong various
 constituencies the parties claim to represent: intellectuals,
 former industrialists, returned overseas Chinese, former KMT
 (Nationalist Party, the dominant party on Taiwan) military and
 civilian officials, and Taiwanese living on the mainland. As
 part of its efforts to give more visibility to these parties,
 the CCP increased their representation in the National
 People's Congress and Chinese People's Political Consultative
 Conference in 1983, and they have been allowed to reestablish
 party newspapers and to recruit new members. Although the CCP
 periodically consults with the representatives of these minor
 parties on important issues, the parties, whose membership
 totals only 120,000, have little discernible impact.
 The National People's Congress meets once a year for about two
 weeks to debate and approve government policies and personnel
 changes determined in advance by the Communist Party. The
 Congress has never rejected a government policy, although some
 have been modified as a result of delegates' concerns
 expressed behind the scenes. More important than the Congress
 as a whole is its Standing Committee, which meets several
 times a year and has the power to approve laws. Drawing on
 six specialized committees formed in 1983 to monitor the
 Government's performance, the Standing Committee played a
 somewhat more vigorous role in 1984, for example, by
 reportedly making suggestions for amendments to laws drafted
 by the State Council.
 China conducted nationwide elections to city, district, and
 county-level People's Congresses in 1984. In these contests,
 Chinese voted directly for their representatives, who serve
 three-year terms. In compliance with the election law,
 candidates exceeded the number of delegates to be elected by a
 ratio of up to two to one. Election Committees (composed of
 CCP and "Democratic' party members, representatives of
 party-controlled mass organizations, government officials, and
 others) selected the candidates, but with close Communist
 Party supervision. In accordance with the party goal of
 increasing non-CCP representation, about 40 percent of the
 victors were not members of the Communist Party, according to
 partial statistics. In the countryside, the authorities also
 staged direct elections for Township People's Congresses using
 similar procedures.
 Women have scored few breakthroughs in the male-dominated
 political establishment. At present, only one of 24 full
 members of the Politburo is female, while just three women
 serve among the 42 ministers in the Central Government. About
 20 percent of People's Congress delegates are female.
 
 
 CHINA
 Participation by women increases somewhat at the provincial
 level and more noticeably at the local level. The 1983
 nationwide reshuffle of provincial leaders included the
 selection of China's first female Governor. Looking to the
 nation's future leaders, CCP General Secretary Hu Yaobang
 mentioned one woman (alternate Secretariat member Hao Jianxiu)
 among five officials being groomed for top leadership posts.
 Minority ethnic groups--who account for 6.7 percent of the
 population and are concentrated in border areas like Xinjiang,
 Tibet, Guangxi, Yunnan, and Inner Mongolia--are permitted a
 limited degree of autonomy. At its 1984 plenary session, the
 National People's Congress adopted a National Minorities Law--
 essentially a compilation of post-Cultural Revolution policies
 and practices with few new departures. Like the State
 Constitution, the new law provides that government heads of
 autonomous regions, prefectures, or countries should be
 members of the locally prevalent minority. Although vague on
 the extent of political autonomy for minority areas, the law
 clearly sets forth their rights to enjoy and develop their own
 cultural traditions, use their own language, and practice
 their own religion. Party policies have reportedly resulted
 in a 30 percent increase from 1978 to 1983 in the number of
 minority persons holding government and party positions.
 Nonetheless, the posts of party First Secretary in the
 autonomous regions and other key positions continue to be held
 by Han Chinese. Moreover, the more liberal minorities policy
 has not eliminated friction between the Han and minorities in
 Tibet and other areas.
 The leadership's liberalization of political, economic, and
 social policies towards Tibet was reiterated by a February
 1984 Forum convened by the Secretariat. One result has been
 the rehabilitation of many members of former Tibetan
 aristocratic families, whose property is being restored, and
 who are given figurehead positions in the Tibetan regional
 government. Three representatives of the Dalai Lama visited
 Beijing during October and November to discuss a possible
 visit by the exiled spiritual leader. At the conclusion of
 their visit, the representatives issued a statement ruling out
 a 1985 visit by the Dalai Lama to Tibet, but leaving open the
 possibility of a trip to other parts of China, including areas
 where ethnic Tibetans live. These discussions took place
 against the background of arrests and executions in 1983 of
 some Tibetans, which the Dalai Lama's representatives said
 included political dissidents. The Chinese government denied
 these allegations, saying the arrests and executions were part
 of a nationwide crackdown on common crime.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Amnesty International issued a study in September 1984,
 entitled 'China: Violations of Human Rights," its most
 extensive treatment of China since 1978. In that report,
 Amnesty International listed its main concerns in China as:
 arrest and imprisonment of prisoners of conscience, and the
 existence of legislation providing for their detention;
 prolonged detention without trial; inadequate trial
 procedures; ill-treatment of prisoners and poor conditions of
 detention; and the extensive use of the death penalty.
 Freedom House described China in 1984 as "not free" and rated
 it a "six" on a descending scale of one to seven for both
 
 
 746
 CHINA
 political and civil liberties. There are no known
 organizations within China which monitor or comment on human
 rights conditions.
 The Chinese regard their human rights record as a matter of
 their internal affairs, and see no justification for
 foreigners to express concern about alleged violations. When
 asked about the 1984 Amnesty International report, a
 government spokesman said only that China has no political
 prisoners in its jails, just criminals and "counter-
 revolutionaries." Amnesty International reported that its
 representatives and Chinese officials have met in New York and
 Geneva over the past two years. Amnesty International added,
 however, that the Chinese Government had failed to respond to
 repeated requests to comment on the organization's concerns
 contained in a 1983 memorandum to the Chinese Government.
 China is a member of the United Nations Commissions on Human
 Rights and on the Status of Women. In addition, the Chinese
 Government has acceded to several international conventions or
 protocols in the Human Rights area, including those on
 refugees, women, and apartheid. In 1984, China hosted a
 United Nations Conference on Juvenile Crime and permitted
 conference participants to tour a juvenile detention
 center--the first United Nations group to do so. China has
 not been the subject of human rights investigations by
 official international organizations.
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 China's population of 1,031,563,000 enjoys basic standards of
 health care and nutrition. State-supplied medical services
 are available at little or no cost. According to the World
 Bank, China's caloric supply exceeded nutritional requirements
 by three percent in 1979; consumption of non-staple foods such
 as meat, poultry, and vegetables has increased rapidly since
 that time. Standards, however, remain significantly better in
 urban areas than in the countryside, and better in coastal
 provinces than in those inland. The 1982 infant mortality
 rate varied from 13 per 1,000 in the cities to 22 per 1,000 in
 the countryside, according to Chinese statistics; 1984 World
 Bank data estimates China's overall infant mortality rate at
 50 per 1,000. Life expectancy is 68 years, above the world
 average. Regional variation in life expectancy ranges from 72
 years in some northern and eastern provinces or municipalities
 (Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, and Liaoning) to 59 in the
 Southwest (Sichuan, Guizhou, and Yunnan).
 With 94 percent of eligible school children enrolled in the
 first year of primary school, the Chinese Government is
 progressing toward its goal of attaining universal primary
 school education by 1990. However, the quality of rural
 education--which mainly consists of. primary education--lags
 far behind that which is available in the cities. Around 30
 percent of young people in the relevant age group complete
 high school, and around five percent of high school graduates
 attend college. The 1982 census placed adult literacy
 (defined as knowledge of 1,500 Chinese characters) at 76.5
 percent of the population.
 Housing is crowded and poorly constructed in both urban and
 rural areas; rural localities frequently lack basic amenities
 such as electricity and running water. Rents are extremely
 low, averaging about 1.4 percent of an urban dweller's
 income. Although most peasants own their own homes and thus
 
 
 747
 CHINA
 pay no rent, they spend about 8.4 percent of their income on
 housing. Construction of housing units is a priority item in
 the Government's economic plan. According to the Ministry of
 Urban and Rural Construction, the Government built 370 million
 square meters of housing from 1979 to 1982, but 50 million
 city-dwellers (one-third of the urban population) were still
 awaiting new housing in 1983.
 With about one-fourth of the world's population squeezed into
 about seven percent of its arable land, China's leaders have
 made population control one of their top priorities. To
 achieve its goal of limiting the nation's population to 1.2
 billion in the year 2000, the Government has instituted a
 strict family planning policy which sets a norm of one child
 per family and is backed by a massive educational campaign as
 well as incentives and disincentives. Benefits accruing to
 couples who agree to have only one child include free medical
 care and education for the child, priority for housing and job
 assignments, cash bonuses when declaring an intention to have
 only one child, and a monthly stipend of five to ten percent
 of base wages paid until the child is 14. Couples who violate
 the one-child limit frequently face intense social pressure or
 coercion, fines, difficulties in securing their share of
 officially-allocated housing, and denial of free medical care
 and education for the second child. More rigorously enforced
 in the cities than the countryside, these measures helped
 reduce the population growth to 11.54 per thousand in 1983.
 In July, a spokesman for the State Family Planning Commission
 said the *one-child" policy would end in 2000 provided the
 nation's population did not exceed 1.2 billion. Government
 guidelines issued in 1984 listing categories of couples
 permitted to have a second child suggested some relaxation in
 family planning policy.
 The one child policy, institution of 'responsibility systems'
 in the countryside, and traditional preference for boys have
 combined to cause a revival of the practice of female
 infanticide. Some top officials, including Premier Zhao
 Ziyang, have publicly condemned the practice. Although
 Chinese officials acknowledge that it is a problem, they claim
 it is not widespread and insist that China's ratio of newborn
 boys to girls is normal. They have'warned the public that
 infanticide is illegal, and state that courts have sentenced
 perpetrators to prison terms ranging from 3 to 13 years.
 According to Chinese authorities, local officials are now
 encouraged to give special treatment to peasant families who
 have baby girls, and the bonus for one-child families with a
 girl is 80 yuan, 30 yuan more than for families with one boy.
 The Constitution endorses the principle that all citizens are
 equal. In the socioeconomic realm as in politics, however,
 women lag behind men despite progress in recent years. Female
 participation in the labor force has increased rapidly in the
 past generation, reaching 36.5 percent of urban workers in
 1983. Yet, women are concentrated in sectors such as light
 industry, where wage rates are lower. Despite increased
 educational opportunities, the percentage of females in school
 drops from 43 in primary grades to 26.2 percent of all
 students in universities; 70 percent of illiterates are
 women. Notwithstanding stiff punishment and official
 discouragement, selling of women and other traditional
 practices, such as arranged marriages and heavy dowries,
 continue to be reported from time to time.
 
 
 748
 CHINA
 Minorities have benefited from the party's more liberal
 programs for them, which include special treatment in marriage
 and family planning, employment, and university admission.
 The Minority Nationalities-Law passed in 1984 stressed the
 Government's commitment to increased economic development in
 minority areas. Nonetheless, the standard of living of
 minorities--most of whom live in poor, remote areas--remains
 far below that of their Han compatriots. Previous
 discrimination against those with suspect backgrounds,
 including intellectuals and former capitalists, has been
 significantly curtailed in recent years.
 One of the poorer developing countries, with a 1982 per capita
 GNP of US $302, China has nonetheless experienced rapid growth
 in recent years. In 1983, national income rose by nine
 percent. The official cost-of-living index rose by two
 percent in 1983, although many foreign observers believe the
 rate may have been closer to ten percent. Urban unemployment
 and underemployment is a serious problem, particularly among
 youth. The rapid growth in the number of collectives
 (production units owned by employees) and of the self-employed
 has helped greatly to alleviate unemployment. Together, these
 two categories of workers accounted for 56 percent of the 1983
 increase in urban employment, although the state sector
 (accounting for 75 percent of the urban work force) remains
 dominant.
 The Communist Party launched a massive economic reform program
 at the Central Committee's October plenum which will move
 China further away from the Soviet economic model. Building
 on the success of earlier agricultural reforms, the new reform
 plan envisions a relaxation of state control over a
 substantial portion of the industrial and services sector,
 while retaining a core of centrally planned economic
 activity. The reforms, to be phased in over five years, call
 for looser planning, rationalized prices and wages, and
 decentralized enterprise management. Although the economy
 will remain socialist, these initiatives will accelerate the
 move of recent years towards a more decentralized economy with
 greater freedom for market forces and individual initiative.
 The Third Plenum initiatives may also result in increased
 prices and wages as well as income differentials.
 Reforms already in place in the countryside allow individuals
 to have more of a voice in what and how much they produce.
 Communes are being dismantled and replaced by township
 governments. While land remains collectively owned, over 95
 percent of rural production brigades have adopted
 *responsibility systems' which allocate the use of land to
 individuals or households for periods of up to 30 years and
 allow them to make their own production decisions after state
 quotas are met. In addition, some 15 percent of agricultural
 land is farmed as private plots. Free markets, where goods
 are sold directly by peasants, are now a common feature of
 life in both urban and rural China.
 Television sets, radios, sewing and washing machines,
 refrigerators, bicycles and other consumer goods can be owned
 by individuals and passed on to descendants. The authorities
 now consider housing to be a consumer good which may be
 privately owned. While houses in the countryside have been
 individually owned for some time, the authorities have begun
 to experiment with transferring ownership of state-built
 apartments to the occupants. In 1984, the Government extended
 this program from the initial four cities to another 80,
 including most major population centers.
