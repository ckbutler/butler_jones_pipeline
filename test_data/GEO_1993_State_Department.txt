 GEORGIA
 Two years after declaring its independence from the Union of Soviet Socialist Re-
 publics, Georgia continued in 1993 to struggle with severe political instability, inter-
 nal armed conflict, economic ruin, and runaway crime. Symptoms of anarchy ap-
 peared, and aspects of Georgia's effort to consolidate democracy were set aside.
 The national Parliament was elected in nationwide elections in 1992; Eduard
 Shevardnadze was elected Chairman of that Parliament in the same elections. A
 November 1992 law established the Chairman of Parliament as Head of State. The
 Chairman subsequently named a Prime Minister and Cabinet of Ministers. That
 Cabinet, and other executive branch officials, report to Shevardnadze.

 Mounting public criticism culminated in a change of government in August-Sep-
 tember which led to a confrontation between Shevardnadze and the Parliament over
 the latter's right to confirm ministerial appointees. Shevardnadze suddenly resigned
 on September 14 but within 24 hours agreed to return if Parliament declared a
 state of emergency and suspended its own activities for 2 months, which it agreed
 to do to avoid further crisis. T'he state of emergency banned demonstrations and lim-
 ited freedom of the press.
 The continuation of the armed conflict in Abkhaia, a breakaway region of Geor-
 gia, was a major factor in the general deterioration of the country's political and eco-
 nomic stability. The Russian Government brokered a cease-fire accord in late July
 but made little apparent effort to hold the separatists to the agreement. The uneven
 implementation of the cease-fire conditions gave the Abkhaz separatists a clear mili-
 tarry advantage, which they used in a major September offensive. This offensive, in
 which volunteer Russian Federation combatants reportedly participated in far great-
 er numbers than Abkhazians, captured the capital, Sukhumi, and the remaining
 Georgian-held cities. The separatist forces committed widespread atrocities against
 the Georgian civilian population, killing many women, children, and elderly, captur-
 ing some as hostages and torturing others (see Sections L.a. and 1.g.).
 Meanwhile, armed Zviadists, supporters of former president Zviad Gamsakhurdia,
 continued acts of banditry during the year and succeeded in late summer in seizing
 control of additional cities and blocking rail lines. The former president himself re-
 turned to Georgia in September, and the long-simmering confict boiled over into
 civil war. After initial losses, government forces recaptured most of the territory
 seized, including the key port town of Poti.
 The Government unsuccessfully tried to eliminate paramilitary forces in favor of
 establishing a single unified army. The regular army, however, totals only a few
 thousand men, poorly armed, trained, and equipped. The National Guard, once the
 largest armed force, was integrated into the Army during 1993. The most prominent
 and best equipped paranilitary group, the Mkhedrioni, led by Djaba loseliani was
 the principal armed defender of Shevardade's Government during the civif war
 with Gamsakhurdia. The members of the "Kommandatura," organizations created
 to enforce the state of emergency, were the principal enforcers and often included
 members of the Mkhedrioni. All these forces, including the police on a less frequent
 basis, committed human rights abuses during the year, including using their powers
 to repress the opposition and rob and intimidate the population. The Intelligence
 and Iformation Service, later renamed the Ministry of Security, a successor to the
 Committee for State Security or KGB, is active in internal security and antiterrrist
 affairs. It also enged in abuses, including the intimidation of opposition figures
 and repression of their viewpoints.
 Georgia's multiple conflicts helpd fuel a continuing downward spiral in the econ-
 omy. When Russia cut off a supply of cash rubles in the spring, Georgia began print-
 ing its own "coupons." Hyprinflation followed, poverty spread dramatically, and
 bread lines lengthened. Industrial production came to a near standstill, as transport
 lines ceased functioning and trade with ex-Soviet republics diminished.
 The armed conflicts with Abkhazians and Zviadists brought forth allegations of
 human rights violations on all sides, including the killing of prisoners and civilians
 and looting of villages. Law enforcement officials were credibly reported to have car-
 ried out arrests without warrants, physically abused detainees, and exceeded the
 legal time limits on pretrial detention without filing charges. Freedoms of speech
 and press, and of assembly and association, were severely curtailed, especially for
 Zviadists, and the state of emergency imposed censorship not only on military sub-
 jects but also on political discourse.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHITS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-In the war in Abkhazia, Georgian
 military or paramilitary units were credibly reported to have killed some prisoners.
 Abkhazian separatists killed members of the Georgian Government in Sukhumi
 after capturing that city. They tortured and killed the Georgian Prime Minister of
 Abkhazia after taking him prisoner in late September and killed many working-
 level officials. They also killed large numbers of Georgian civilians who remained
 behind in Abkhaz-seized territory. It is credibly reported that volunteers from the
 Russian Federation fighting with the separatists carried out many of the killings.
 Zviadists shot to death a senior officer of the Georgian air force in October in
 Mengrelia, when he traveled to the area for preagreed negotiations. Zviadist forces
 also executed a Georgian journalist captured in Mengrelia during the height of the
 civil war.
 
 
 878
 b. Disappearance.-Many Georgians caught in Abkhazia when the separatists
 launched their September offensive are unaccounted for. Over 1,000 people are still
 reported missing. Many are presumed to have been killed.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Members of the police, paramilitary groups, the intelligence service, and the armed
 forces have been credibly accused ofrroutinely beating detainees in order to extort
 information or force confessions. Some senior government officials attempted to re-
 form the practices of these organizations, but stiff resistance limited their effective-
 ness. No perpetrators of abuses within the official community are known to have
 been prosecuted or punished for their actions.
 Law enforcement officials were credibly reported to have frequently beaten detain-
 ees, arrested despie an apparent lack of evidence linking them to a specific crime,
 in order to extort payments from prisoners' families to effect their release. In one
 case, officials severely beat a man accused of robbery and demanded that he pay
 them a sum equivalent to the value of the goods stolen, although there was no evi-
 dence to substantiate their allegations of criminal activity. They are credibly re-
 ported to have tortured the victim by hanging him by his arms for extended periods.
 Physical abuse directed at political detainees continued in 1993. Several Zviadists
 arrested in connection with terrorist acts committed or allegedly planned in 1992
 claimed they were subjected to physical abuse in 1993. In some instances, the per-
 petrators of the abuse were already convicted prisoners with whom the detainees
 had been placed in violation of prison regulations. The Zviadists alleged that these
 prisoners were acting as proxies for the Government. In one case, a convicted mur-
 derer who beat an elderly Zviadist was tried and convicted for the attack. In other
 instances, detainees told a parliamentary human rights committee that officials had
 beaten them. According to the committee chairman, their claims were probably
 valid.
 After the outbreak of civil war in October in western Georgia, there were wide-
 spread arrests of Zviadists. An elderly Zviadist newspaper editor, Irakli Gotsiridze,
 subjected earlier to intimidation (see Section 2.a.), was arrested without a warrant
 and held at the Thiisi Kommandatura. (Normally a military pst, the Kommanda-
 tura was used to hold political prisoners ater the state of emergency was declared.)
 Members of the paramilitary or armed forces beat him so severely that he suffered
 damage to his ribs and lungs. Despite repeated requests, the Government delayed
 access to the editor for over 30 days afer the beating and failed to provide him with
 proper medical care.
 Paramilitary or armed forces members on October 13 detained another supporter
 of the ex-president, Tamaz Kaladze, who had earlier headed a petition campaign
 calling for Shevardnadze's resignation, and severely beat him. Eyewitnesses who
 saw him soon after his detention reported that he had severe bruising on his neck,
 blood coming from his ears, swollen face and eyes, and complained of severe pain
 in his kidneys. Kaladze was also beaten on the balls of his feet, given electrical
 shocks, and nearly suffocated when guards held a plastic bag over his head. Kaladze
 was eventually released, after a total of 38 days in jail; Gotsiridze was released after
 36 days.
 It is also credibly reported that members of the Kommandatura staged fake exe-
 cutions to terrorize the prisoners.
 Prison conditions declined, along with the general economic and political situa-
 tion. In general, prison administrators did not receive enough money to provide pris-
 oners' meals in accordance with Soviet-era regulations. Meals were often Spartan
 as a result, although in some places of detention prisoners' relatives were permitted
 to bring them food. Conditions in many places of detention other than the prisons
 can be extremely primitive, with no bathing facilities, no place to lie down, and no
 toilet.
 Medical care for prisoners also suffered from the shortage of funding and break-
 down of governmental operations and authority. At least one prisoner died in cus-
 tody in 1993 when authorities were unable to move him to a hospital for several
 days because of gasoline shortages and a lack of police escorts.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.--Soviet-era legislation and practices with
 regard to arrest and detention remain largely unreformed, and such legal protec-
 tions as exist are often ignored in practice. Under existing law, an arrest order is-
 sued by a procurator is required for arrests. If a person is caught in the act of com-
 mitting a crime, he may legally be detained without a warrant. However, the law
 requires the detaining officer to inform a procurator of the detention immediately
 and to obtain an arrest order as soon as possible. A person may be legally detained
 for 72 hours without an arrest order, but the procurator must issue either an arrest
 order or an order for the prisoner's release upon expiration of that period. If held
 
 
 879
 over for further investigation, a detainee must be formally charged with a crime
 within 10 days. There is no bail.
 The normal period of permissible pretrial detention is considered to be 2 months,
 but that period may be legally extended twice, up to a total of 6 months, by the
 Deputy Procurator General. The Procurator General may extend pretrial detention
 up to a maximum of 1 year. A detainee may ask the procurator to determine if his
 detention is legal. A detainee has the right to demand immediate access to a lawyer
 and to refuse a statement in the absence of counsel. The detaining officer must in-
 form the detainee of those rights and must notify his family of the detainee's loca-
 tion as soon as possible.
 A detainee's family may ask to see him, but the investigator handling the case
 may refuse access if he believes it would hamper the investigation. Once the inves-
 tigation is finished and the investigative results have been forwarded formally to
 a court p ending trial, family members are allowed to visit their detained relatives
 only to discuss a possible change of attorneys. The presence of an attorney is man-
 datory during interrogation of a minor or of an individual accused of a capital crime.
 The presence of a teacher or a parent is also obligatory during questioning of a
 minor.
 In practice, law enforcement personnel and paramilitary groups that often act on
 behalf of the Government often ignored these legal protections. Authorities fre-
 quently detained people arbitrarily and exceeded time limits for detention and filing
 charges. People do not always have access to a lawyer or do not hire a lawyer be-
 cause they are not informed of their rights. In a characteristic case the investigator
 handling the case of a Zviadist scientist detained and beaten in 6ctober said that
 the case was still being investigated and no formal charges had been filed, so an
 attorney was not yet needed. Families are often not notified of the whereabouts of
 their detained relatives. Instances of such abuses involve both politically motivated
 detentions and those for criminal offenses.
 The Soviet-era administrative code permits administrative detention without a
 warrant for several kinds of violations, including participating in an illegal dem-
 onstration and curfew violation. The law on the state of emergency passed by the
 current Parliament is the legal basis for administrative violations and sentencing
 during the state of emergency. Either a senior Interior Ministry official or an admin-
 istrative judge must confirm the detention. In the former case, materials must be
 sent to a judge within 3 hours, who must then decide the case within 24 hours.
 There is no formal trial in administrative cases. Although the judge should consult
 with the accused, he is not required to consult with witnesses nor make a lawyer
 available if the defendant requiests one. The maximum sentence is 15 days.
 Under legislation establishing a state of emergency in September, the Ministry of
 the Interior retained the right to confirm the validity of detentions, a right shared
 by the city "kommandants . The kommandants are, under the state of emergency,
 responsible for law and order in the city, and their authority supersedes that of all
 other law enforcement bodies. The Government abuses the administrative law sys-
 tem, using it to extend politically motivated detentions. Under the state of emer-
 gency in effect from early fall through the end of the year the kommandants and
 senior Ministry of Internal Affairs officials in Tbilisi legally assumed authority to
 confirm administrative law detentions. This has contributed to the abuse of the ad-
 ministrative violation system for politically motivated detentions. Aside from the
 fact that an independent judge does not review the case, defendants are not always
 told what they have been charged with and to what term they have been sentenced
 and are sometimes not released on time even if sentenced. Even when a state of
 emergency was not in effect, the administrative system was sometimes used as a
 mechanism for short-term politically motivated detentions. When a number of
 Zviadist sympathizers were detained in Tbilisi in October after the civil war began,
 administrative violations were often cited, incredibly, as the reason for those deten-
 tions.
 Arbitrary detentions of Zviadists occurred throughout the year. On one such occa-
 sion, all the leaders of the Zviadist "Roundtable" organization were arrested as they
 held a meeting. They were released hours later. When the civil war broke out,
 Tbilisi authorities arbitrarily detained a large number of known Zviadist sympathiz-
 ers.
 Government paramilitary groups, including the Mkhedrioni, were responsible for
 serious abuses of the legally established system of protections. The Mkhedrioni ap-
 peared to operate with impunity in intimidating and detaining Zviadists or sus-
 pected Zviadists without legal sanction, though such actions appeared to lessen
 throughout the course of the year. When the Mkhedrioni detained persons, they
 would sometimes bring them to a jail facility belonging to an official agency of the
 Government. They would sometimes simply bring individuals to their staff head-
 
 
 880
 quarters, question them, and release them. At times, those detained would be
 turned over to regular law enforcement personnel. Police officials also frequently
 brought Zviadists in for questioning in a practice that appeared to amount to direct
 intimidation of political activities. This pattern reached its height during the civil
 war with Gamsakhurdia's supporters. The Mkhedrioni also participated in the in-
 creasingly common practice of detaining persons for ransom, and they did so in
 western Georgia when they were deployed there for the civil war. For their part,
 Zviadist forces also arbitrarily detained a senior official of the Tbilisi Government
 when he passed through Mengrelia while fleeing the fall of Sukhumi. He was held
 for severa weeks before being released.
 The Government states that all detained members of the political opposition were
 terrorists or had committed specified violations. However, the detentions of many
 Zviadists after the civil war flared up in late September were often tacitly acknowl-
 edged to be preventive detentions. Zviadist forces contend, credibly, that many peo-
 ple were detained in 1993 solely for political reasons, usually for short periods, and
 some were detained several times.
 Law enforcement personnel, members of the paramilitary, and kommandatura
 workers often arbitrarily detained people for the purpose of extorting payments from
 them or their families. Detainees were usually released after such payents were
 made. The paramilitary, Kommandatura, army, National Guard members, and, at
 engaged in robbery, intimidation, and even murder for personal gain.
 e. 1enil of Fair Public Tria!.-Politica instability and weaknesses in the judicial
 system sometimes infringed on the right to a fair trial. Georgia's legal structure is
 a hybrid of laws from Georgia's brief period of pre-Soviet independence, the Soviet
 era, the Gamsakhurdia presidency, and the State Council period. The court system
 consists of district courts, a city court for Tbilisi, and the Supreme Court of the Re-
 public. The two autonomous republics within Georgia each have their own supreme
 court, theoretically subordinate to the Georgia Supreme Court.
 In theory, Georgian citizens are by law guaranteed the right to a fair public trial
 at which defendants have the right to be present. They have the right to an attorney
 immediately after arrest, at public expense if needed. They are entitled to confront
 prosecution witnesses and present witnesses and evidence on their behalf. There is
 a presumption of innocence, and defendants have the right to appeal to either the
 procuracy or the Supreme Court.
 In practice, the judiciary is vulnerable to political or other forms of influence, par-
 ticularly at the local level. Certain supervisory rights exercised by the procuracy fur-
 ther limit the independence of the judiciary. As part of the Soviet-era system still
 in effect in Georgia, the procuracy has the right to suggest that the Supreme Court
 review one of its own decisions. By contrast, the judiciary has little influence over
 the procuracy. Some members of the judiciary engage in corrupt practices, including
 taking bribes and being influenced by instructions received from individuals beth in-
 side and ouside the Government. The practice cometimes referred to as "telephone
 justice," i.e., that an official calls a judge and tells him how to resolve a case, contin-
 ued in 1993. The societywide fragmentation of authority and collapse of order in
 1993 presented judges with an increasing number of power- or weapon-wielding fig-
 ures outside government who demanded, often successfully, certain outcomes in the
 cases under their jurisdiction.
 It is difficult to estimate the number of political prisoners detained during the
 course of the year, though their numbers probably exceeded 100. By year's end it
 appeared all had been released. In 1993 the Government brought to trial over 40
 persons, all of them Zviadists, accused of terrorist acts or plotting to commit such
 acts in 1992. One case ended with the conviction of all 20 defendants in the
 "Kvareli" trial, in which those captured from an armed Zviadist gup established
 in eastern Georgia in 1992 were tried. The court threw out several charges brought
 by the Government; most defendants were convicted of banditry, and some of con-
 spiracy to commit terrorist acts and diversions. Another trial convicted three per-
 sons of banditry, terrorism, and kidnaping for the 1992 kidnaping of government of-
 ficial Sandro Kavsadze. The maximum sentence received by any defendant was 15
 years. Another trial just under way as the year closed is examining charges against
 approximately 20 persons charged in connection with 1992 car bombings targeting
 Mkhedrioni leaders and with other alleged terrorist plots. Though Zviadists claim
 that those detained in the above cases are political prisoners, the Government de-
 nies that accusation, noting it has solid evidence supporting the charges. The
 Zviadist claim at this point does not appear to be valid. The Zviadists also claim
 that some of the defendants were repeatedly pressured to sign statements or confes-
 sions. That claim is likely valid.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-A war-
 rant issuedby a prosecutor is required legally for a search, but entry into homes
 
 
 881
 without judicial sanction by both paramilitary forces and law enforcement rep-
 resentatives is common. Government intelligence agencies are widely believed to
 monitor telephone conversations, but it is difficult to determine how general the
 practice is.
 It is widely believed that the appointment of a new security minister sympathetic
 to Moscow signaled the beginning of a closer coopration between the Committee for
 State Security (KGB) and Georgian intelligence. Ty law, there is supposed to be leg-
 islative oversight of the intelligence service; however, the oversight is completely in-
 effective.
 The jamming of radio and television broadcasts is no longer practiced, and receipt
 of foreign publications is unimpeded.
 g. Use of Excessive Force and Violations of Humanitarian Law in Internal Con-
 flicts.-The armed conflict in Abkhazia wreaked havoc for most of the year. The sep-
 aratists violated a short-lived cease-fire in March, and fighting between Georgia and
 the Abkhazians continued until the Russians brokered a cease-fire in July. The Rus-
 sian Government made little apparent effort to hold the separatists to that agree-
 ment, however, and its uneven implementation gave the Abkhaz separatists a clear
 military advantage. They exploitedthat in a major September offensive to seize con-
 trol over all of Abkhazia, with the subsequent human tragedy that unfolded.
 Even before their offensive, Abkhaz forces had waged a documented campaign of
 indiscriminate warfare that included repeated heavy shelling and aerial bombard-
 ment of civilian-populated areas of Sukhumi in which hundreds of noncombatants
 were killed. Georgian forces also shelled opposing civilian areas, though on a much
 more limited scale. Russian military forces are reported also to have shelled Geor-
 gian civilian areas in response to Georgian shelling of Abkhaz positions located to-
 gether with Russian military positions.
 The separatists launched a reign of terror against the majority Georgianjpopu-
 lation, athough other nationalities also suffered. Chchens and other north Cauca-
 sians from the Russian Federation joined local Abkhaz troops in the commission of
 atrocities. The summary execution of Georgian troops and civilians in the captured
 areas triggered a massive flight of displaced persons which international relief orga-
 nizations roughly estimated at 230,000-250,000 people. The Abkhazians shot down
 four aircraft, two of them civilian flights, during the last days of their successful
 siege of Sukhumi. They also shot at, and barely missed, an aircraft carrying a team
 of Georgian officials engaged in formal negotiations with the Abkhazians. The entire
 Georgian population (47 percent versus 17 percent Abkhazians, prior to the Septem-
 ber offensive) and most of the rest of the non-Abkhazians fled from Abkhazia as the
 result of the activities of the Abkhaz separatists.
 Those fleeing Abkhazia made highly credible claims of atrocities, including the
 killing of civilians without regard to age or sex. Corpses recovered from Abkhaz-held
 territory showed signs of extensive torture. The ethnic Georgian Prime Minister of
 Abkhazia, Dzhuli Shartava (see Section L.a.), was one such victim: his body was cov-
 ered with severe bruising; his arms, legs, hands, and feet had been broken; his nose
 had been mutilated; his ears cut off; and his kneecaps shot before death-reportedly
 for "refusing to kneel." An elderly Russian woman, resident in Abkhazia for 35 years
 before fleeing her village on September 16, reported that separatist forces seized
 nine vllagers after they took control of the area and killed th~em all. She saw the
 body of her 30-year-old male neighbor, which showed evidence of massive beating;
 splinters had been inserted under his nails, and his skull had been crushed.
 The Abkhazians also accused the Georgians of human rights violations, including
 an "ethnic cleansing" campaign. There is little evidence to support allegations of
 ethnic cleansing, although it is probable that some ethnic Abkhazians were forced
 to move from Georgian-held territory in isolated instances.
 Both sides were charged with occasionally killing injured soldiers captured on the
 battlefield. One injured Abkhaz soldier disappeared from the Sukhumi hospital
 where he was being treated; it is likely Georgian forces killed him. While specific
 incidents are difficult to confirm, these charges are probably accurate.
 Conflict between Zviadists and the Tbilisi Government erupted into open civil war
 during the summer. Zviadists seized cities controlling rail and road lines to the port
 of Poti just before the Abkhazian separatists launched their successful offensive on
 Sukhumi. They captured Poti after the fall of Sukhumi, as well as a series of other
 towns, but lost most of their captured territory as a result of a government counter-
 offensive in October.
 Both sides in this struggle accused the other of abusing prisoners and engaging
 in banditry and looting from civilians wherever they were deployed. The accusations
 are credible. Members of the National Guard and Mkhedrioni engaged in many
 forms of criminal activity, sometimes stealing cars, robbing homes, and looting the
 countryside.
 
 
 The Zviadist armed forces, for their part, also stole cars, exacted "customs" fees
 from those traveling through their territory, hijacked railroad freight, and stole
 lare stores of humanitarian aid after capturing Poti.
 One government fighter captured by  viadist forces reported after his release sev-
 eral days later that they had beaten and tortured him and several of his fellow pris-
 oners while in detention. He appeared on television at the time, his face showing
 obvious signs of severe beating. Georgian officials claim many other prisoners suf-
 fered similar treatment. In October the Zviadists executed a captured Georgian jour-
 nalist covering the war in Mengrelia, along with three government troops captured
 at the same time.
 Peacekeeping forces succeeded in separating the combatants in South Ossetia,
 and the cease- ire was essentially observed. However, isolated killings of both civil-
 ians and peacekeeping troops occurred. Many Ossetian displaced persons returned
 to Tskhinvali, but Georgian displaced persons were still afraid to return, as Geor-
 gian authorities and peacekeeping forces in practice had been unable to guarantee
 their security. Ethnic Ossetians who fled to Ossetia from other regions of Georgia
 during the height of the conflict also had not been able to return to their homes.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-Freedoms of speech and press were curtailed
 in 1993, particularly for supporters of the former president and especially after the
 imposition of the state of emergency in September. The emergency legislation called
 on the various law enforcement organs to "control" media reporting on military ac-
 tivities and antigovernment information. A committee, headed by paramilitary chief
 Djaba Ioseliani indicated that formal censorship of military information would be
 complemented by extensive review of material published and broadcast and "rec-
 ommendations" to individual journalists on improving their work.
 As the civil war flared in mid-October, Shevardnadze announced that it would be
 necessary to close some newspapers and cancel some television programs, and in-
 creased restrictions on the media followed. Radio and television access was limited
 for some non-Zviadist opposition elements. Opposition parties Charter 91 and the
 National Independent Party (NIP) both claimed they were denied access to tele-
 vision air time formerly given freely. Some opposition politicians credibly claimed
 the restrictions were aimed at muting public criticism of Shevardnadze's decision to
 take Georgia into the Commonwealth of Independent States.
 Following the state of emergency, only three newspapers, all official, continued
 publishing without interruption. The single government-run printing office pre-
 vented all independent newspapers from publishing for a short period for "technical
 reasons." Restrictions targeted Zviadist publications, although other independent or-
 gans also came under attack. The Zviadist newspaper Iberia Specter, after putting
 up with various restrictions, was closed down by the Government in early fall. Au-
 thorities justified the closing by claiming the Specter published calls for the violent
 overthrow of the Shevardnadze Government. Nevertheless, the Government has not
 been able to prove its claims as yet. The paper's editor, Irakli Gotsiridze, was also
 harassed personally. Unidentified assailants twice fired shots through the windows
 of his apartment. The police have not identified the perpetrators. Getsiridze was ar-
 rested and severely beaten in October when he went to a police station to complain
 about the arrests of some colleagues (see Section 1.c.). The staff of the Zviadist
 newspaper Samreklo also claimed that its chief editor was threatened and that
 shots were fired at his apartment. He fled Tbilisi as a result.
 Editors of non-Zviadist independent papers Seven Days and Droni asserted they
 also were subject to severe repression. Seven Days reported that the Mkhedrioni de-
 tained one of its journalists for 2 days and seized her notes in August when she
 passed through Mengrelia on the way back from Abkhazia. On September 17, 10
 armed and masked men ransacked the newspaper's offices, destroying the comput-
 ers and beating up 4 men. The attack came just after the newspaper criticized the
 appointment of a National Democratic Party (NDP) leader as a Cabinet member.
 ie ven Days' staff claimed that NDP members had done the ransacking in retal-
 iation, citing a number of private and public statements by NDP leaders that lent
 credence to that claim. After the ransacking, Droni published a short story criticiz-
 ing the incident as inconsistent with democracy. Their chief editor stated that a sen-
 ior NDP official immediately threatened that bodily harm would come to her if she
 were not more careful in the future. NDP senior officials refuted the accusations
 against their party.
 Another Zviadist newspaper, Free Georgia, continued to struggle in 1993 against
 a 1992 order that closed it down. The judge who issued the order explained his ac-
 tion as a temporary measure intended to get the paper's editorial staff to come to
 his chambers to discuss the case so it could come to trial. Though members of the
 
 
 883
 editorial staff eventually met with him to discuss the case, they represented them-
 selves as "individuals" and declined to accept responsibility in the case. The procu-
 racy initiated the case by sending a notification to the Supreme Court suggesting
 it examine the banning of the paper because of published material that provoked
 the 1992 cou atempt. The procuracy, however, failed to provide supporting mate-
 rials to the 8ourt. The judge's actions appear to have been sincere, but the legal
 reasoning behind the or der closing the paper apppears questionable.
 The newspaper's editor continued to push unsuccessfully for its reinstatement.
 She was subsequently fired from her teaching job at the university. The university's
 administrators claimed her dismissal was due to her repeated failure to show up
 for classes. The Zviadists claimed that her dismissal was based on her political
 views and that she was absent only for a few months when whe was forced to flee
 to Moscow because of threats against her.
 Self-censorship continued to be widespread in the Georgian media throughout the
 year. While some political arty newspapers criticized government policies, most
 avoided open opposition, particuarly dire  criticism of Shevardnadze, often focusing
 on the crisis situation instead. Fear of retaliation by paramilitary groups also played
 a role.
 The broadcast media are affected by the same kinds of psychological and physical
 barriers to freedom of expression as the print media. The second television chan-
 nel-nominally, but not fully independent in practice-continues to operate since its
 establishment in 1992. However, efforts to control the media in October included re-
 strictions on the second channel's programming. The official television channel and
 radio station engaged in self-censorship.
 Freedom of speech and press were also limited in the autonomous Republic of
 Ajara, where voices critical of that republic's leadership found little opportunity to
 voice their opinions in public forums. An opposition newspaper was ransacked and
 banned.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The right to peaceful assembly
 was limited in 1993, and, following the state of emergency in September demonstra-
 tions were legally prohibited. The only demonstration attempted in Tbilisi was pre-
 vented by government troops.
 Legislation in effect prior to the state of emergency required that demonstration
 organizers notify city authorities of an impending demonstration 2 days in advance;
 permits were not required, but the authorities had the right to determine if the sug-
 gsted location was acceptable. Zviadists refused to comply with the law's provisions
 requiring registration in advance. In the first half of the year, the authorities often
 responded to Zviadist defiance by using extensive manpower to prevent demonstra-
 tions in Tbilisi from taking place.
 When demonstrations occurred, government forces usually dispersed them with
 force and detained some demonstrators. The dispersals often involved beatings.
 Zviadists claimed that demonstration participants were also sometimes followed as
 they left demonstrations and beaten or threatened. A demonstration dispersed on
 April 5 involved both beatings and threats. A demonstration dispersed on April 14
 also allegedly involved some beatings. A massive police and nonuniform presence
 blocked a May 26 (Independence Day) demonstration from ever getting under way.
 In Tbilisi, the authonties did permit some unregistered Zviadist demonstrations
 to take place. On April 9, a day of national mourning for the Georgians commemo-
 rating a Soviet armed attack on peaceful demonstrators, the Zviadists were allowed
 to stage a large rally and march in the center of Tbilisi. In midsummer, the
 Zviadists were also allowed to stage two rallies in a large Tbilisi park. When govern-
 ment officials were partially in control of parts of Mengrelia, they permitted dem-
 onstrations to take place there unimpeded. Demonstrations in Poti also were gen-
 erally staged without interference.
 With some exceptions, freedom of association was generally observed in 1993. Or-
 ganizations are legally required to register with the Government. Several Zviadist
 organizations did not attempt to register officially but were not forced to disband.
 The leaders of the non-Zviadist opposition political party, Citizens League, formed
 originally in 1989, claimed they were harassed and that their members were intimi-
 dated from conducting a program of activities. The Communist Party is banned.
 Some individuals claim that the Government occasionally erects bureaucratic obsta-
 cles to the registration of unfavored organizations, but there is no evidence to sug-
 gest that any serious impediments exist, although the Zviadist organizations have
 avoided testing the bounds.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-Freedom of religion and of worship was widely observed
 in 1993. The Government abandoned the emphasis given during Gamsakhurdia's
 rule on the primacy of the Georgian nationality and the Georgian Orthodox religion.
 However, representatives of the Georgian Catholic Church are still trying to recover
 
 
 884
 possession of churches which they first lost during the Soviet-era repression of reli-
 gion and which were subsequently given to the Georgian Orthodox Church during
 the Gamsakhurdia period. The Government's Commission on Inter-Ethnic Relations
 and Human Rights recommended that two churches be returned to the Catholics;
 thus far it appears that none has been offically turned over. Local officials have
 shown some resistance to community efforts to construct new mosques in predomi-
 nantly Muslim areas, although that resistance appears to be lessening and does not
 appear to have been based on directives from the authorities. The Jewish commu-
 nity experienced no government interference in practicing its religion. Although reli-
 gious groups, missionaries, and foreign clergy would be required to register in order
 to benefit from government benefits and recognition, there appeared to be no re-
 quirement for them to do so.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The old Soviet system of registering residency remains in place, al-
 though its enforcement is uneven. If a person were arrested and were discovered
 to be nonresident in an area, that persons might be forced to leave. However the
 authorities and law enforcement personnel do not routinely check people's docu-
 ments to determine who is a lega resident. People can (and do) live for extended
 periods somewhere other than where they are registered.
 Both foreign and internal travel, as well as emigration, are unrestricted, although
 there are practical problems with traveling in the areas of conflict.
 The Abkhaz separatists' seizure of control over all Abkhazia in late September,
 as well as the terror and human rights abuses that accompanied that seizure,
 caused a massive flow of displaced persons, including virtually every ethnic Geor-
 gian. There are an estimated 230,000 to 250,000 displaced persons in Georgia, and
 there has been no sign that the separatists would allow the displaced persons to
 return to their homes.
 The Government provided assistance in facilitating the emigration of Jewish
 Georgians to Israel.
 There is continuing controversy over the desire of former residents, primarily
 Muslims, of the Mskheti region--deported from Georgia in 1944 by Stalin-to return
 to that area. Over 200,000 Mskhetians now living in central Asian republics and
 parts of Russia face significant popular opposition to their return, and the Govern-
 ment has been reluctant to take a formal position. Although some very small-scale
 programs have led to the return of some Mskhetians, the Government is clearly
 esitant to permit the return of most of them, possibly fearing additional discord
 and problems resulting from attempts to resettle them. In south Ossetia, many
 Ossetian displaced persons returned to Tskhinvali, but Georgian displaced persons
 remain afraid to return. Ossetian displaced persons from other areas in Georgia for
 the most part have also not been able to return to their homes.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Georgia's Parliament and Parliament Chairman Eduard Shevardnadze, who is
 head of the executive branch, were elected in nationwide elections conducted in Oc-
 tober 1992. Those elections were judged by international observers to have been free
 and fair, although widespread technical violations were reported, and some regions
 not under Tbilisi's control chose not to participate in the polling. Deputies were
 elected according to a mixture of direct elections in individual districts and party
 lists voted on in larger regions. According to the election law promulgated before
 those elections, deputies and the chairman were elected for 3-year terms.
 Parliament's ability to function was limited in 1993. Tensions with its Chairman,
 Shevardnadze, increased during the year as the latter became increasingly disdain-
 ful of the legislature's ineffectiveness. Tensions between the legislature andthe Cab-
 inet of Ministers also grew, with each accusing the other of responsibility for the
 nation's problems. The tensions between Shevardnadze and Parliament came to a
 head just before the crises in Abkhazia and Mengrelia peaked in September.
 Shevardnadze suddenly resigned his post in early September after parliamentary
 member and Mkhedrioni chief Dzhaba loseliani criticized his plan to introduce a
 state of emergency. Shevardnadze came back into office a day later, buoyed by mas-
 sive popular demand and on the condition that Parliament approve a nationwide
 state of emergency and then suspend itself for 2 months. Parliament, enjoying little
 popular support, agreed to do so.
 The Abkhaz war prevented the functioning of the elected parliament in that re-
 public. Policies of the leadership of the autonomous Republic of Ajara prevented that
 republic's parliament from functioning effectively; it did not meet in plenary in
 1993. South Ossetian separatists scheduled elections for December, though the
 Georgian Government does not recognize an autonomous status for that region. The
 
 
 885
 elections did not take place, probably due to internal differences among South
 Ossetian leaders.
 Minorities and women are less represented in the new Parliament than they were
 in the Gamsakhurdia-era parliament or in the Soviet-era supreme soviet. The par-
 ticipation of women in politics is generally limited, partly by longstanding cultural
 traditions and partly in response to a perception that women were frequently ex-
 president Gamsakhurdia's most fervent supporters.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Among domestic human rights groups, the All-Georgian Association for Human
 Rights, founded in 1990, claims about 300 members. The Association has not met
 with overt official restrictions, but the Government has at times been uncooperative.
 For instance, the association has not been able to gain permission to visit prisoners.
 The organization has also not been able to get articles on human rights violations
 against Zviadists published in the official or non-Zviadist independent press. In Oc-
 tober two members of the association were arrested for several days. Members of
 the pro-Zviad Helsinki Union's Commission on Human Rights were sometimes de-
 tained for short periods. These detentions appeared to be for political reasons.
 A government Commission on Interethnic Relations and Human Rights was
 formed soon after Shevardnadze's return in 1992. The Commission had limited in-
 fluence on the behavior of the procuracy, National Guard, Interior Ministry, and
 paramilitary groups. Commission members do not have any statutory right to de-
 mand visits with detainees and are thus dependent on law enforcement officials'
 goodwill to obtain eyewitness information on alleged abuses. On several occasions,
 however, Commission members succeeded in gaining access to prisoners and in rec-
 tifying abuses in both the detention process and elsewhere in the Government.
 The Government welcomed the visits of international organizations. A permanent
 mission of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) to Georgia
 is still operating after its establishment in late 1992. The CSCE Chairman-in-office,
 Swedish Foreign Minister Af Ugglas, visited Georgia in October and traveled to
 south Ossetia. A permanent U.N. Mission to Georgia continues to function and ex-
 p and. A U.N. special mission to examine human rights violations in the Abkhaz con-
 flict came to Georgia, also in October. The United Nations conducted a seminar for
 Georgian human rights workers in April. Two Helsinki Watch missions visited Geor-
 gia to study human rights problems.
 The members of the permanent International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC)
 mission in Georgia were permitted by both sides to travel freely throughout the con-
 flict zone in Abkhazia. Both sides generally allowed the ICRC access to prisoners,
 although it is likely they did not get to meet with all of them.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 There are no legal or constitutional prohibitions against discrimination. Georgia's
 constitutional situation is extremely vague. A new constitution is being drafted; for
 now the country operates on a mixture of the Soviet-era constitution and the 1921
 constitution.
 Women.-Government concern about the status of and discrimination against
 women is minimal. Georgian society generally shares this low-level concern. There
 is no perceptible women's movement, nor are there academic programs in women's
 studies. There is a widely accepted stereotype that the majority of Gamsakhurdia's
 supporters are somewhat irrational women. This image has had a negative impact
 on the viability of women's involvement in Georgian politics.
 Women's access to educational resources is unimpeded, but women are found
 mostly in traditional occupations where their labor is usually low-paid and often
 part-time. The more traditional women's fields are considered to be the arts, lan-
 guages, and social sciences. Careers that involve technical skills, applied sciences,
 or supposedly "more complex" reasoning are heavily male-dominated. This dis-
 proportion is generally explained by the students as due to the financial prospects
 in a field. Men are expected to choose a field in which they can support themselves
 and their families, women a field that will enrich them personally but not take
 away too much from family life.
 Statistics on violence against women are not available. According to sociologists
 and legal specialists, however, incidents of rape and domestic violence are relatively
 rare in Georgia. However, the societywide upsurge in all forms of crime, including
 violent crime, appears to have resulted in an increase of violent crime against
 women, including rape.
 
 
 886
 Children.-The severe economic crisis that      p  d Georgia throughout 1993
 meant in essence that government expenditures frte welfare of any group within
 society were inadequate to meet its needs. Although spending on children's welfare
 within the context of total government resources reflected, in relative terms, an ade-
 quate commitment to that vulnerable group, children like adults, suffered as a re-
 sult of the Government's inability to increase spending levels to compensate for
 hyperinflation.
 There are no children's rights advocacy groups. Neither are there juvenile or fam-
 ily courts in Georgia.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-Government advocacy of the supremacy of
 the Georgian nationality, language, and religion ceased with Gamsakhurdia's depar-
 ture from power. The nationalistic feelings that it aroused in the population, how-
 ever, appear to have lingered and have been compounded by the poor economy. Non-
 Georgians experience harassment, usually because of competition for scarce re-
 sources. As one Georgian human rights activist described it, there are three castes
 of non-Georgians. Jews are in the hi hest caste, Russians and Armenians in the sec-
 ond caste, and Azeris in the third. The lower the caste, the more frequent the prob-
 lems. Local police are sometimes indifferent to requests for assistance from non-
 Georgians. Local officials sometimes also engage in discrimination against non-Geor-
 gians. However, central authorities when notified of complaints of harassment or
 other forms of discrimination, usualfy tried to rectify the situation.
 The Georgian Government provides funding for ethnic schools, and the teaching
 of non-Georgian languages is freely permitted. In Azeri-populated areas, where
 Georgian is not the primary language, the wider availability of Azeri-language
 schools and the poor quality of Georgian-language instruction have produced grad-
 uates who face limited professional opportunities in Georgia because of their poor
 command of the language.
 People with Disailitles.-Statistics on the treatment of individuals with disabil-
 ities are unavailable. There is no legislative or otherwise mandated provision of ac-
 cessibility for the disabled. The law on labor does include one section on people with
 disabilities, which includes the provision of numerous special discounts and favor-
 able social policies for those with disabilities, especially disabled veterans. Severe
 discrimination against the disabled does not exist, though individual cases of dis-
 crimination probably do occur on a limited basis.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Labor Code and other Soviet-era legislation
 allow workers and employees to freely form unions and associations operating on
 their own charters. In order to acquire legal status, unions and associations must
 register with the Ministry of Justice.
 A single Georgian Confederation of Trade Unions (GCTU) includes about 30 dif-
 ferent sectoral unions. There are no legal requirements that a union join the GCTU.
 However, no significant unions operate outside its framework. Membership in the
 GCTU is declining rapidly, due to lack of worker interest.
 Strikes are not legally permitted under the state of emergency; they are permitted
 at other times. However, at year's end, the Government was considering legislation
 that would permit them. In practice, the authorities allowed strikes to occur
 unimpeded. For example, when miners went on strike in the town of Tkibuli, the
 Government allowed the strikers to receive two-thirds of their regular pay. The
 draft bill under consideration would also prohibit any type of management retribu-
 tion against striking workers.
 In general, the extreme economic crisis gripping the country throughout the year
 kept Georgian workers away from the picket line. There were only a handful of
 strikes, and these almost always took place at individual enterprises. Tbilisi's metro
 workers went on a short "warning strike" in September, demanding higher wages.
 The resulting public outrage, largely due to the fact that metro workers were earn-
 ing considerably more than the average Georgian, deterred the employees from car-
 rying out their threat of longer strikes.
 There are no legal prohibitions against affiliation and participation in inter-
 national labor bodies. Georgia is not a member of the International Labor Organiza-
 tion (ILO).
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The Soviet-era Labor Code
 allows for collective bargaining, and it is freely practiced. The Government is becom-
 ing less involved in negotiations between management and workers, even in cases
 concerning state-owned enterprises, and has largely restricted itself to enforcing the
 minimum wage.
 The Labor Code prohibits antiunion discrimination by employers against union
 members. According to the Code, employers may be prosecuted for antiunion dis-
 
 
 crimination, and, if found guilty, would be required to reinstate the employees and
 a them back wages. The Department of Labor Inspections within the Ministry of
 abor investigates complaints, although their extremely small staff (about 11 mem-
 bers) did not allow for effective investigations in 1993.
 There are no export processing zones in Georgia.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Labor Code prohibits forced
 or compulsory labor and provides for sanctions against violators. Violations are rare,
 and the Department of Labor Inspection investigates charges.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-According to the Labor Code, the
 minimum age for employment of children is 14 years. Between 14 and 16 years,
 total hours worked during the week may not exceed 30 hours. The minimum age
 is widely respected, and officials know of no sectors where the rule is violated. Be-
 cause of the inadequate resources of the Department of Labor Inspection, enforce-
 ment of this provision is often left up to the unions themselves.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-A nationally mandated minimum wage applies
 only to the government sector. Private sector employers are free to bargain on any
 wage, and a private contract specifying a wage lower than the minimum (for govern-
 ment workers) is not prohibited. The minimum wage rate is adjusted every month
 for inflation, although in practice the hyperinflation of 1993 means the minimum
 wage met only a fraction of basic consumer needs. In mid-September, the minimum
 wage was about $0.75 (9,200 coupons) per month.
 The Labor Code contains provisions for a 41-hour workweek. Before Parliament
 adjourned in September, it was considering legislation establishing a standard 40-
 hour workweek. The Department of Labor Inspections investigates complaints of
 violations. There is a 24-hour rest period in the week.
 The Government has not addressed the issue of occupational safety and health
 standards. In general, workers may obtain higher wages for hazardous work, and,
 according to the Labor Code, may refuse to work when such work might endanger
 their lives. Nevertheless, labor experts consider these provisions inadequate safe-
 guards for worker well-being.
