 MAURITIUS
 A small, densely populated island country, Mauritius is a
 parliamentary democracy and a member of the Commonwealth of
 Nations. It is governed by an elected prime minister, a
 council of ministers, and a legislative assembly. The
 Governor General, with largely ceremonial powers, represents
 Queen Elizabeth II, the titular Head of State. Elections at
 national and local levels take place at regular intervals.
 There are four major political parties, which reflect a range
 of ideological views, and several smaller parties. Executive
 power has changed hands twice in the last 7 years through fair
 and orderly elections supervised by an independent
 conmission. Prime Minister Jugnauth's coalition had its
 mandate renewed in general elections in August 1987.
 Mauritius has no purely military forces; a paramilitary
 700-man Special Mobile Force and a 240-man Special Support
 Unit are responsible for internal security. These forces,
 under the command of the Commissioner of Police, are
 apolitical, well trained, and backed by a general duty police
 force of approximately 4,000 men.
 The economy, based on export-oriented manufacturing (mainly
 textiles), sugar, and tourism, experienced an economic boom
 during 1984-88, with an average real growth rate of 7 percent
 annually. Per capita income, in current terms, almost
 doubled, rising from $1,065 in 1984 to $1,921 in 1988.
 Unemployment fell from 21 percent in 1983 to 3.6 percent in
 1988, essentially a full-employment situation. With the
 assistance of the World Bank and the International Monetary
 Fund, Mauritius has made remarkable progress in implementing a
 program combining adjustment, growth, and modernization.
 Prospects for 1989-90, however, are less optimistic. The
 emergence of labor and skills shortages, rising inflation,
 environmental issues, and other physical constraints are
 expected to slow down economic growth to around 4 percent.
 The Government continued to demonstrate respect for human
 rights. Political and civil rights, including the freedoms of
 speech and press, are protected under the Mauritian
 Constitution and respected in practice. The August 30, 1987
 elections for Parliament were preceded by intense campaigning,
 including regular public rallies. The controversial Dangerous
 Drug Act of 1986 calls, among other things, for the death
 penalty for traffickers. Under the Act, the defendant is
 tried by a judge without a jury, which is contrary to
 established practice.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 There were no reports of government-inspired political or
 extrajudicial killings.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reports of disappearance of persons for
 political causes.

 MAURITIUS
 c. Torture and Other"Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Torture and inhuman punishment are prohibited by law, and
 there were no reports of degrading treatment or punishment.
 Vigorous enforcement 6f the Dangerous-Drug Act has led to a
 decline in drug-demand. Drug-related-arrests declined in 1988
 and 1989.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 There have been no reports of arbitrary arrests or detentions
 since the early 19701s; Detained persona have the right to a
 judicial determination of the legality of their detention. In
 practice, this determination is usually made within 24 hours.
 Bail is commonly granted. The Supreme Court ruled invalid in
 1986 a section of the Dangerous. Drug Act of 1986 which had
 provided for detention without bail.
 Exile 'is legally prohibited. With regard to forced or
 compulsory labor, see Section 6.c.
 e. 'Menial of Fair Public Trial
 Mauritius, judicial system, modeled on that of Great Britain,
 consists of the Supreme Court, which has appellate powers, and
 a series of lower courts. Final appeal may be made to the
 Queen's Privy Council in the United Kingdom and is routinely
 made in the cases of death sehtences. There are no political
 or military courts. The judiciary is independent. The
 Governor General, in -consultation with the Prime Minister,
 nominates -the Chief Justice and, in consultation with the
 Chief Justice, nominates the senior puisne (associate)
 judges. The Governor General nominates other judges on the
 advice of the Judicial and Legal Service Commissions. The
 legal system has consistently provided fair, public trials to
 those charged with crimes. Defendants have the right to
 privateï¿½br court-appointed counsel. The judiciary is also
 charged under the-Constitution with ensuring that new laws are
 consistent with democratic practice. There are no political
 prisoners in Mauritius.
 The Dangerous Drug Act, which includes a mandatory death
 sentence for- ny'person convicted of importing dangerous
 drugs, has been controversial. Some human rights
 organizations in Mauritius, as well as individual Mauritians,
 have criticized the provisions of the law that call for the
 death penalty and that provide for trial by a judge alone; all
 other serious offenses are heard by a nine-member jury. At
 the end of 1989, there were six persons in prison convicted on
 drug charges and under the death sentence.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The sanctity of the home is guaranteed by law and generally
 respected in practice. The search of personal property or
 premises is allowed only under clearly specified conditions by
 court order or by police decision if an'illegal act has been
 committed. There have been reports from reliable sources that
 the Government's intelligence apparatus occasionally opens
 mail and carries out surveillance of local opposition leaders
 and other major figures.

 MAURITIUS
 In October 1986, following the Rault Commission on Narcotics,
 the Legislative Assembly amended the Mauritian Constitution
 with regard to drug traffickers and drug trafficking in
 Mauritius. The legislation increased the powers of any
 commission of inquiry to look into personal finances,
 including bank accounts; provided for fines of persons who
 refuse to testify; provided for fining a bank and revoking its
 license if it refuses to cooperate in a financial
 investigation; and provided for the seizure of all assets of
 convicted drug traffickers who cannot prove that their assets
 were obtained legally.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Freedom of speech and press is protected by the Constitution
 and by local tradition. Sixteen privately owned daily,
 weekly, and monthly newspapers present varying political
 viewpoints and freely express partisan views. Newspapers are
 subject only to the legal constraints of libel laws. The
 Government owns the one television and two radio stations (one
 strictly educational), broadcasting in five languages. The
 television and radio are reasonably objective, in news and
 entertainment presentation, although opposition politicians
 occasionally accuse the broadcasting corporation of political
 bias in its news coverage. Television and radio broadcasts
 are also easily received from the nearby island of Reunion (a
 French Department) and are not subject to interference by the
 Government. However, any foreign satellite broadcasts, Dr
 programs from foreign sources, which are deemed controversial
 are subject to approval by the Council of Ministers before
 transmission on local television or radio.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Mauritians enjoy the right to form associations, including
 political parties, trade unions, and religious organizations.
 Mauritius has a multitude of such private organizations.
 Political, cultural, and religious assemblies are
 commonplace. Although police permission is required for
 holding demonstrations and mass meetings, such permission is
 rarely refused. The registered political parties freely held
 large public rallies during the campaign for the August 1987
 general elections, the October 1988 municipal elections, and
 the June 11, 1989, La Caverne/Phoenix by-election.
 For a discussion of freedom of association as it applies to
 labor unions, see Section 6.a.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 There is no official state religion in Mauritius, although
 Hindus are a majority. Hindus, Christians, Muslims,
 Buddhists, and others openly practice, teach, and proselytize
 their religions without prejudice. All religious institutions
 receive state subsidies in proportion to their memberships.
 There is no state-sanctioned discrimination against any ethnic
 or religious community. The Government facilitates the travel
 of Mauritians who make the hajj. Foreign missionaries are not
 allowed to enter the country without a prior request from a
 local religious organization.

 MAURITIUS
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 There are no restrictions on full freedom of movement within
 the country. Foreign travel and emigration-are also
 unrestricted. There is no blanket guarantee of repatriation,
 nor general criteria for processing applications for
 repatriation;.applications from the thousands of Mauritians
 abroad are handled on a case-by-case, and sometimes arbitrary
 basis.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right cf Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Citizens have the right to change, and do change their
 government through democratic means. Mauritius is governed by
 a freely elected, unicameral Legislative Assembly, with
 executive direction coming from a Council of Ministers,
 currently headed by Prime Minister Sir Aneerood Jugnauth whose
 Alliance coalition won elections in 1983 and 1987. The
 Governor General has the right to designate the person charged
 with forming a new government following parliamentary
 elections or in a parliamentary crisis. Parliamentary,
 municipal, and village council elections are held at regular
 intervals. Voting and running for office are rights of all
 citizens 18 years of age and over.
 In the Legislative Assembly, 8 of the 70 members are appointed
 through a complex "best loser" system designed in part to
 ensure that all ethnic groups are a4equately represented. The
 governing (3-party) Alliance coalition controls 41 of the 70
 seats. Political parties often match the ethnicity or
 religion of their'candidates to the composition of particular
 electoral constituencies. In the August 1987 parliamentary
 elections, 89 percent of the 553,364 eligible voters cast
 ballots. Only 9,512 votes separated the winning and losing
 coalitions. The opposition controls the five major
 municipalities, and government parties did not contest the
 October 25, 1988, municipal elections. The governing Alliance
 won a June 11, 1989, by-election for the Legislative Assembly
 in the constituency of La Caverne/Phoenix.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 There have been no known requests by international
 organizations to investigate human rights violations in
 Mauritius. Several local human rights groups monitor
 devlopments without governmental restriction.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Although Mauritius has a Hindu majority, the country's active
 press and strongly egalitarian traditions militate against
 discrimination in all forms. However, tensions based on
 ethnicity and caste do exist.
 Women in Mauritius participate in all types of political,
 business, and social activities, and a few hold important
 positions. Nonetheless, traditional ethnic and religious
 attitudes hamper women in achieving true parity. The
 Mauritian Government seeks to improve the status of women, and
 recent amendments to laws ranging from emigration to
 
 
 232
 MAURITIUS
 inheritance have removed sex discriminatory sections. An
 interministerial committee, headed by one of the female
 ministers, was appointed in 1985 to address remaining
 discriminatory elements in local laws and practices. In its
 report in 1988, the committee, which was subsequently
 disbanded, found that there was little legal discrimination
 against women. One notable exception, that women cannot serve
 on juries, may be amended in 1990. The Government decided in
 July to appoint "desk officers" in the major ministries to
 oversee women's activities and ensure that the promotion of
 the interests of women are taken into account.
 According to the Ministry of Women's Rights and Family
 Welfare, physicians, attorneys, and religious and charitable
 organizations, the problem of violence against women exists
 and appears to be fairly prevalent,, although no reliable
 statistics are available. There are no special provisions in
 Mauritian law concerning family violence; there are virtually
 no institutions that attempt to deal with the problem. The
 Government's concern about the issue of violence against women
 has been evident, however. This concern was officially
 manifested in June 1989 when the Ministry of Women's Rights
 and Family Welfare established a family counseling service,
 managed by the National Council of Women, whose mandate is to
 provide family counseling and legal advice. Some 300 persons
 have aviiled themselves of counseling in the intervening
 period. This counseling has run the gamut of family problems,
 of which spouse abuse is only one of the issues. However, no
 specific campaign against spouse abuse has been undertaken.
 Police authorities are generally reluctant to get involved in
 instances of wife beating; penalties are rarely imposed and
 tend to be light. Spouse abuse is not publicly discussed in
 Mauritius.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Mauritius has an active trade union movement. Almost 300
 unions represent about 100,000 workers, more than one-fourth
 of the work force. Unions are free to organize workers in all
 sectors, including the export processing zone (EPZ) which
 employs about 90,000 workers. Less than 10 percent of EPZ
 workers are believed to be unionized. Unions can press wage
 demands, establish ties to domestic political parties and
 international organizations, and address political issues.
 Three of the five trade union activists who ran in the August
 30, 1987, general elections were elected to the Legislative
 Assembly on the government slate. Wages have become a major
 issue in recent years as inflation has accelerated.
 In theory, unions have the right to strike. However, in labor
 disputes, the British-modeled Industrial Relations Act (IRA)
 of 1973 requires a prestrike, 21-day cooling-off period
 followed by binding arbitration, which has the effect of
 making most strikes illegal. Refusal to follow IRA procedures
 in a mid-1988 textile plant strike led to the imprisonment of
 three union leaders for several days. Government supported
 labor/management negotiations ultimately led to the
 reemployment of most of the striking workers. A general
 strike called by the trade unions for July 4, 1989, received
 far less support than expected.
 One leading federation actively supports the opposition party
 and is affiliated with the Communist-controlled World
 
 
 233
 MAURITIUS
 Federation of Trade Unions. The largest confederation, the
 Mauritian Labor Congress, is a member of the International
 Confederation of Free Trade Unions.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 While the right of association is guaranteed by law, there is
 no legal provision for collective bargaining, which is neither
 protected nor promoted by the Government. In fact, the
 Government has imposed restraints on the collective bargaining
 system which render it ineffective.
 The Government has established a National Remuneration Board
 (NRB) whose chairman is appointed by the Minister of Labor.
 The NRB- establishes minimum wages for 26 categories of private
 sector workers (sugar, tea, transport, etc.) which apply
 equally to export processing zone workers. Although
 originally established to set minimum wages for nonunion
 workers, the NRB has broadened its powers and now issues
 remuneration orders that establish minimum wages, bonuses,
 housing and transportation allowances, and other benefits for
 almost all private sector workers. About 85 percent of all
 private sector workers (including unionized workers) are
 covered by NRB orders. Employers and unions are free to
 negotiate wages and benefits above the minimums established by
 the NRB, but this is rare. Wages and benefits for civil
 servants are established by the Pay Research Bureau (PRB) on
 the basis of the annual Chesworth Report recommendations. NRB
 remuneration orders set minimum wages by sector but also
 establish a wage structure based on length of service and job
 classification. NRB orders thus set wages for skilled and
 experienced workers whose earnings are well above the minimum
 wage. The PRB functions in a similar way for the civil
 service.
 The Government has also established a Tripartite Committee,
 including employer and trade union representatives, which
 meets once a year and is chaired by the Minister of Finance.
 It can only recommend wage increases to the Government based
 on inflation. Its recommendations are not always unanimous,
 however, and the Government makes its decision on the basis of
 all the information it receives.
 The International Labor Organization (ILO) Committee of
 Experts (COE) has for some time noted that the Industrial
 Relations Act does not give workers' organizations sufficient
 protection against acts of interference as provided for by ILO
 Convention 98 on the right to organize and bargain
 collectively.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Forced or compulsory labor is prohibited by law and is not
 practiced. The COE, however, has noted that sections of the
 IRA, which empower the Minister to refer any industrial
 dispute to-compulsory arbitration, enforceable by penalties
 involving compulsory labor, are in conflict with ILO
 Convention 105 on the Abolition of Forced Labor.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 The minimum work age is 15. The Ministry of Labor is
 responsible for enforcing child labor laws. In practice,
 there is minimal enforcement of these laws, especially in
 EPZ-related industries where a labor shortage exists.
 
 
 234
 MAURITIUS
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 Conditions of employment, including wage and leave conditions,
 are generally sufficient to afford an acceptable standard of
 living for workers in the agricultural, service, and
 manufacturing sectors. However, the current rate paid for
 unskilled labor, $8 per week during the first year and $10 per
 week thereafter, is barely sufficient for a worker to have a
 minimum standard of living, and much depends in this respect
 on the type of additional benefits offered. The Government
 mandates minimum wage increases each year based on inflation.
 A maximum workweek of 45 hours is allowed. Excessive overtime
 continues to be a problem in the EPZ. The Government
 addressed this issue in 1987 due to complaints that EPZ
 employers imposed long hours of overtime on employees--about
 10-20 hours per week making for a 55-65 hour workweek. In
 addition, some EPZ employers still require women to work at
 night.
 The Government sets health and safety standards, and
 conditions are inspected by Ministry of Labor officials.
 Enforcement is limited due to the small number of inspectors.
