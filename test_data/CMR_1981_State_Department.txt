 CAMEROON
 
 Cameroon, though splintered ethnically and diverse regional-
 ly, culturally, and religiously, has had political stability
 and economic and social progress under the same one-party
 civilian leadership since 1960. Cameroon's complex domestic
 character, along with its unique history as the only African
 state to fuse former British and French territories, has
 made national unity one of the country's principal objec-
 tives. The former Federation of East and West Cameroon was
 made a United Republic under the 1972 constitution. The
 government has pursued the development of national institu-
 tions, such as a single National Political Party (UNC) and
 a Unified Labor Movement (UNTC). During the 1960's the
 government suppressed an ethnically based, ideologically
 motivated guerrilla challenge. In recent years, as the
 threat of internal subversion has receded, political de-
 tainees have been released and restrictions on civil liber-
 ties have been relaxed. Nevertheless, decision making in
 Cameroon is highly centralized and civil and political
 liberties are circumscribed. At the same time, the govern-
 ment has been successful in utilizing the country's resources
 together with foreign assistance to help meet the basic eco-
 nomic and social needs of the people.
 1.   Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 Torture is proscribed implicitly in the constitution and
 specifically in criminal procedure, which makes evidence
 obtained by torture inadmissible. Nevertheless there have
 been credible reports of harsh treatment during police
 interrogation and imprisonment in the past, and several
 police officers have been charged and found guilty of
 practicing torture.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 The Cameroon penal code prohibits public servants from using
 force against any person except under extraordinary circum-
 stances (e.g., a person resisting arrest). Government
 officials claim this prohibition is strictly enforced and
 cite several examples of prison sentences given policemen
 who physically abused others. Amnesty International has
 reported allegations of harsh prison conditions and ill
 treatment of detainees, and there are reports of unnec-
 essary use of force by the police, ranging in severity from
 bullying to brutality. Such incidents allegedly take place
 during checks for identification or other papers, apprehen-
 sion of suspects, or interrogation at police stations.
 The Cameroon government acknowledges that prison conditions
 are overcrowded and inadequate, and attributes this to a lack
 of resources, rather than deliberate neglect. The diet and
 health care offered at the overcrowded prisons is inadequate.
 Since the daily food budget for each prisoner is less than 20
 cents, most prisoners supplement their diet with food brought
 
 
 38
 by family or friends during visiting hours. Prisoners are
 treated equally regardless of class, race, religion or sex.
 Persons under "administrative detention" (i.e., political
 prisoners) are kept in special camps or prisons. The only
 kind of physical punishment permitted under the penal code is
 the death sentence, used for serious crimes such as homicide
 and armed robbery. Other punishment is in the form of prison
 sentences. There are no summary executions in Cameroon.
 Access to the "administrative detention" center by families
 and friends is reported to be severely restricted.
 c. Disappearances
 Those detained administratively for reasons of national
 security, as described below, are not processed accord-
 ing to normal civil procedures. Amnesty International
 claims that some such prisoners have been held for many
 years. No such detention is known to have resulted in
 "permanent disappearance" or death.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 A person arrested on suspicion of committing an offense may
 not be held for more than 48 hours without a court order.
 After an investigating magistrate has determined that the
 case should be brought to trial and has issued a warrant to
 this effect, there is no limitation on how long the person
 charged may be held in "preventive detention" pending trial.
 Accused persons awaiting trial constitute the great majority
 of prisoners in the prisons at Yaounde and Douala. Release
 on bail is infrequent. Nonetheless, the equivalent of habeas
 corpus does exist in Cameroon under the High Court Law of
 1972, and has proven effective in seeking legal remedy for
 persons detained illegally. The main difference in the
 application of habeas corpus between the Anglophone and
 Francophone provinces of Cameroon is in procedure.
 Persons may be held in "administrative detention" under
 legislation pertaining to subversion. Such detention by
 local authorities is initially for three months, renewable
 for three more, and may be extended up to an additional 12
 months by the minister of territorial administration. Recent
 unconfirmed reports indicate that approximately 40 political
 prisoners were released in 1980, leaving less than 15 known
 prisoners in administrative detention. Under a state of
 emergency, local authorities also may order detention for up
 to one week of persons judged "dangerous to public security."
 The minister of territorial administration may order detention
 of such persons for up to two months, and the order may be
 renewed without limitation. A state of emergency is in
 effect in a limited area of west-central Cameroon where the
 insurgency in the 1960's took place, apparently as a precau-
 tionary measure which would permit the government to act
 swiftly in case of perceived threats to public security
 there.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Cameroon law guarantees criminal defendants a fair public
 trial, including legal representation at state expense if
 necessary. Lawyers have unrestricted private access to
 defendants, and both lawyers and defendants are made fully
 aware of the charges and evidence. Legal representation is
 
 
 39
 automatic in cases for which the death penalty or imprison-
 ment for ten years or more may be imposed. In practice,
 legal representation may not be available in some cases
 involving lesser sentences because defendants are notaware
 of their rights or because they are unable to afford counsel.
 Courts are independent of executive and military control.
 Civilians can be tried by military courts if they are charged
 with committing a crime jointly with a soldier. Due process
 for military courts is the same as for civilian courts.
 Verdicts of both civil and military courts may be appealed to
 the appeals court at the provincial level and to the supreme
 court at the national level. With regard to judicial proceed-
 ings, the court does not distinguish between those accused of
 ordinary crimes and those accused of political offenses.
 A distinguished commission of jurists recently completed
 its proposed revisions of Cameroon's criminal procedure and
 evidence code. If adopted, this legislation promises to
 strengthen protections for the accused -- including improve-
 ments in pre-trial, post-trial, and bail procedures.
 f.   Invasion of the Home
 The Cameroonian penal code prohibits the entry into another's
 residence without permission unless such entry is made pur-
 suant to a court order or under a state of emergency. In
 practice, indiscriminate and unauthorized entry into homes
 occurs during occasional police sweeps of the poorer resi-
 dential districts in searches for criminals.
 2.   Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 The Cameroonian constitution guarantees freedom of speech,
 press, religion, and assembly. In practice there are re-
 strictions on these freedoms. Except for independent week-
 lies in Douala, Victoria, and Bamenda, the Cameroonian press
 and radio are government-owned and controlled. Criticism of
 the government is discouraged and the media are used to
 support government programs and institutions. All media
 elements are inhibited by occasional intimidation of jour-
 nalists and the possibility of censorship. As a result,
 self-censorship is widely practised, particularly with regard
 to political criticism. Opposition viewpoints are not
 ventilated in the media. A June 1981 presidential decree
 stipulated that all newspapers and periodicals must request
 authorization to publish from the ministry of territorial
 administration. This new law gives the government increased
 discretionary power over the print media. The media have,
 however, criticized inefficiency and unresponsiveness by the
 police, the university and other public institutions. A
 recent newspaper series, for example, exposed poor conditions
 in Cameroon's prisons. No newspapers have been closed but
 journalists who have not exercised restraint have in the
 past been banished to provincial assignments. Foreign
 magazines have been seized by the government when articles
 have touched on areas considered to be sensitive.
 Professors and students at the university are strongly dis-
 couraged from writing or publishing works critical of the
 
 89-SIO 0 - 82 - 4
 
 
 40
 Cameroonian Government and its policies. However, a wide
 range of research which is not blatantly oppositionist is
 encouraged. The works of certain authors critical of the
 government may not be imported or read in Cameroon.
 The government encourages the expression and development of
 ethnic traditions within the framework of overall Camer-
 oonian unity. Cameroon is a nation of Muslims, Christians
 and animists. Followers of these religious beliefs do not
 appear to enjoy any particular advantage or suffer disad-
 vantage. Freedom of religion is protected by law and
 generally respected in practice. Religious groups are
 required to register with administrative authorities. Sects
 not accepting temporal authority, such as the Jehovah's
 Witnesses, are proscribed. The practice of witchcraft and
 sorcery is considered a crime under Cameroonian law and
 persons have been convicted and jailed under this statute.
 Freedom of assembly and association is guaranteed in the
 constitution but in practice is restricted. The Cameroonian
 penal code prohibits public meetings, demonstrations or
 processions without prior government approval. Labor unions
 are incorporated into the government-controlled single
 national party. They participate in a government regulated
 negotiation process but strikes are illegal. Business groups
 are organized under the government-sponsored chamber of
 commerce. There is a national bar association. Other
 interest groups include professional organizations and
 informal associations.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration and Repatriation
 Freedom of movement within the country is not restricted
 by law. In practice, however, the police frequently stop
 travellers for checks of identity, tax receipts, and the
 like. These checks sometimes develop into incidents of petty
 harassment and bullying.
 Exit visas are required to leave the country. Often they are
 available only after long bureaucratic delays. In some
 cases, these delays may represent attempts by the government
 to discourage or even prevent departure. Women must have
 permission of their husbands to leave the country. Cameroon-
 ians leaving the country must deposit sums sufficient to
 buy a one-way return air ticket for repatriation should they
 become stranded abroad. There are no restrictions on the
 right of voluntary repatriation.
 Cameroon has offered safe-haven to many refugees from Nigeria
 and Equatorial Guinea (EG) in past years, and from Chad
 during 1980 and 1981. Most of the 30,000 refugees from
 Equatorial Guinea returned to that country by late 1979
 after the change of government there in mid-1979 and the
 declaration of General Amnesty for all exiles. Following the
 outbreak of civil war in Chad in March 1980, about 100,000
 Chadian refugees fled to Northern Cameroon, where the govern-
 ment has taken an active role in providing food and shelter
 with the help of foreign donors. These refugees have been
 well treated in what many observers have described as an
 exemplary program of international refugee assistance.
 Cameroon has cooperated with the United Nations High Commis-
 sioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in a program of voluntary
 
 
 repatriation, and has offered those Chadians not wishing to
 return to Libyan-dominated Chad the opportunity to resettle
 in Cameroon. The government has given asylum in the past to
 Equatorial Guinea political figures.
 C. Freedom To Participate In The Political Process
 Cameroon is a one-party state. Opposition parties are
 not tolerated, and all political activl-ies must take place
 under the umbrella of the Cameroon National Union (UNC).
 Citizens who accept these constraints can participate in
 political activity. This often involves competition at the
 local level among factions representing different political
 points of view. For the majority of the Cameroonians who are
 not party activists, however, the political process involves
 little element of choice. Women enjoy equal rights with men
 under the constitution and are politically active in the UNC.
 An affiliated group, the Organization of UNC Women, was cre-
 ated in 1966 to develop and implement social and educational
 programs aimed at emancipating Cameroonian women. Women are
 members of the central committee, comprise ten percent of the
 deputies in the national assembly, and hold cabinet positions
 as well as other senior positions in the government. Their
 participation and role in the government and society are
 growing.
 3. Government Attitude and Record Regarding International
 and Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Amnesty International regularly requests information from the
 Cameroonian government on the status of persons allegedly
 detained without formal charges and without public trial. At
 first, the government recognized no obligation to respond to
 queries about specific individuals. It has recently stated
 that each such case is thoroughly investigated. Amnesty
 International states that the only responses received from the
 Cameroonian government have been denials that the individuals
 in question are detained in Cameroon. In 1980, Amnesty Inter-
 national requested the government to permit the inspection of
 prisons by an independent humanitarian organization. The
 request was not acknowledged, and no action is believed to
 have been taken by the government. President Ahidjo in
 February 1980 responded indirectly to Amnesty International's
 criticism by rejecting the charge that human rights are not
 respected in Cameroon. There are no organizations within
 Cameroon which observe, report or contest human rights
 violations.
 4. Economic and Social Circumstances
 The Cameroon Government's strong commitment to meeting the
 economic needs of its population is reflected in its policies,
 developmental emphasis and planned allocation of resources.
 Development plans have been prepared every five years since
 independence. Moreover, specific government policy and
 actions such as (1) budgetary expenditure levels; (2) creation
 of parastatal organizations for specific development functions
 in various sectors of the economy; (3) the overall rural
 development strategy with its heavy emphasis on productivity
 programs supported by appropriate export producer pricing
 
 
 42
 systems and incentives; (4) legal access to a proportion of
 commercial bank loans (20 percent of all banking loans) to
 small businesses and (5) lack of excessive restrictions and
 controls on prices, all provide initiative for labor,
 encourage productivity, and enhance overall economic growth.
 The population is estimated at 8.1 million with an average
 density of 17 persons per square kilometer. The population
 growth rate is 2.3 percent. Life expectancy is presently
 about 46 years, and the national infant mortality rate
 is 157 per 1000 live births.
 The national active labor force participation rate is 48
 percent. Eighty percent of this labor force (3.0 million)
 are in the rural areas engaged in farming or small businesses
 such as tailoring, baking and minor crafts. Two hundred
 thousand are engaged in the industrial sector and the remain-
 ing 600,000 in the tertiary sector. The labor force in the
 public sector reached 100,000 by 1981, and has increased at
 an annual rate of 6.9 percent. In 1980 the government
 reported a national unemployment rate of six percent --
 12.2 percent in the urban areas, and about 4.3 percent in the
 rural areas. Considering the annual economic growth of over
 six percent during the past-three years, the expansion of em-
 ployment opportunities has not kept pace with either the
 growth in the work force or the intensified national investment
 of over 24 percent of the gross domestic product (GDP). The
 rate of inflation, as recorded monthly by the IMF, is
 currently estimated at about 10.3 percent.
 Fifteen percent of the urban population and 40 percent of
 the rural population of Cameroon are estimated to live
 below the absolute poverty level. Scanty national income
 data indicates that ten percent of the population receives
 about 60 percent of the income. This implies that 90 per-
 cent of Cameroon's population receives an income of less
 than one half of the national per capita average of $560.
 These differences in part stem from the diversities in
 geographical areas and limited access to ideas, markets
 and services.
 A national nutritional survey (1978) reported that about
 21 percent of children under five years of age suffer from
 chronic undernutrition. Acute moderate to mild malnu-
 trition is suffered by 4.8 percent of the children under
 5 years of age.
 The school enrollment rate for children between the ages of
 6-14 averages 88 percent in urban areas and 46 percent in
 rural areas. These figures, although high, mark regional
 differences in access to primary education. School attendance
 rates are one-third the national average in the Muslim north,
 where only 22 percent of the children attend school.
 Women, by law, enjoy equal rights with men under the Camer-
 oonian constitution and are politically active in the Cameroon
 National Union (UNC), the nation's sole political party. The
 women's wing of the UNC, created in 1956, oversees the
 development and implementation of social and education
 programs aimed at encouraging the economic and social produc-
 tivity of the Cameroonian women.
 Cameroonian women are represented in the modern sector,
 although not proportionately in the upper levels of admini-
 stration and in the professions. Women hold such positions
 in the government as minister of social affairs, vice-minister
 of education, membership in the party central committee,
 deputyships in the national assembly and other positions in
 various ministries.
