 ICELAND
 Iceland is a vigorous, multiparty, parliamentary democracy in
 .which freedom of the press and freedom of association are
 sacrosanct. Its literate and educated people participate in
 high percentages in regular fair and free elections which
 determine the distribution of power among political parties
 and leaders.
 The civil and criminal justice systems offer equal protection
 to all. The nation has no indigenous military forces or
 political security apparatus.
 Iceland has a mixed, open economy in which all of its citizens
 enjoy the right to hold private property.
 Icelanders have long been strong defenders of human rights
 both at home and internationally, and the country has an
 exemplary human rights record.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 Political killings do not occur.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no instances of abductions, hostage-taking, or
 disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Torture and cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or
 punishment are all prohibited by law and do not occur in
 practice.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Due process is provided by law and observed in practice. The
 Icelandic Constitution states that any person detained by the
 authorities must be brought before a judge within 24 hours and
 either charged, released on bail, or released unconditionally.
 Any unfavorable judicial ruling at that point may be appealed
 immediately to a higher court. Preventive detention is not
 practiced. There were no allegations of arbitrary arrest.
 There is no exile. With regard to forced or compulsory labor,
 see Section 6.c.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Defendants may confront witnesses and otherwise participate in
 public trials, which are fair and free from intimidation. In
 addition, defendants are guaranteed the right to competent
 legal counsel of their own choice. In cases where defendants
 are unable to pay attorney's fees, the State does so. The
 courts are free of political control, Although the Ministry
 of Justice administers the lower court system, the Supreme
 Court carefully guards its independence and fairness. Juries
 
 
 1097
 ICELAND
 are not normally used, but multijudge panels are common,
 especially in the appeals process, and due process is
 rigorously observed. There are no political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Under the Constitution and in practice, there is deep respect
 for the autonomy and rights of individuals. A warrant from a
 court is required for entry into a home except in cases of hot
 pursuit. Arbitrary intrusions by official entities, political
 organizations, or any other organized group into the private
 beliefs or personal liberties of individuals do not occur.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution expressly forbids censorship and other
 restrictions on the freedom of the press and a person's right
 to express his thoughts. Citizens and the media exercise this
 freedom extensively. Academic freedom of expression is
 vigorously exercised.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Constitution provides citizens the right to join together
 formally or informally to form associations without
 governmental authorization. A varied and wide spectrum of
 voluntary organizations plays a vital role in Icelandic
 politics and society. Icelanders are free to maintain
 international contacts. In addition, the Constitution
 provides for the right to assemble unarmed, except when it is
 feared that such gatherings may cause riots. In practice,
 plans for public meetings are virtually never forbidden, and
 the authorities only rarely modify them..
 For a discussion of freedom of association as it applies to
 labor unions, see Section 6.a.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Although the Lutheran Church is the established church of
 Iceland and the vast majority of citizens are nominally
 members, there is complete freedom for other faiths. A
 variety of both Christian and non-Christian faiths are allowed
 to proselytize freely. They may maintain ties with and
 receive support from coreligionists abroad. Religious
 affiliation is not a factor in political or economic life.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Icelanders have freedom to travel at home and abroad, to
 emigrate, and to return to Iceland at will. Refugees are
 never compelled to return to a country in which they would
 face persecution.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 The political system is an open, fully functioning,
 parliamentary democracy in which voters freely choose the
 members of the Althing (Parliament) who, in turn, make the
 
 
 1098
 ICELAND
 laws of the land and determine the composition of the
 Cabinet. Parliamentary elections are held at 4-year intervals
 unless the Althing dissolves itself before the end of its full
 term. Voting in elections and membership in the various
 political parties are open to all citizens who are 18 years of
 age or older. Primary elections are used to select most
 Althing candidates. Multimember districts and proportional
 representation increase the chances for minority viewpoints to
 be represented. In addition, there is a strong cultural
 insistence on having the views of all significant groups
 represented in the Althing.
 In the last parliamentary election in April 1987, seven
 parties won seats in the Althing, including two which had not
 previously had seats. Because no single party had a majority
 of seats, negotiations among the parties resulted in the
 orderly transfer of power to a new three-party coalition
 government in July 1987. This coalition broke up on September
 17, 1988. On September 28, the Progressive Party, Social
 Democratic Party, and People's Alliance formed a new
 left-center government with Steingrimur Hermannsson of the
 Progressive Party as Prime Minister.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 No serious human rights violations have been alleged. In
 1987, however, one Icelander complained to the European
 Commission on Human Rights that it was a violation of his
 rights to have an official of the same agency which accused
 him of violating a traffic law also pass judgment on and
 sentence him (i.e., impose a monetary fine for speeding). The
 Commiission has agreed to accept this case, and it is now
 pending. The Icelandic Minister of Justice introduced a bill
 in the 1987-88 session of the Althing which would have
 transferred all judicial authority from local officials, who
 also serve concurrently as chiefs of police, to a new system
 of eight district courts. This bill will be reintroduced in
 the 1988-89 session of the Althing and, if passed, will remedy
 the substance of complaints of this type.
 Several human rights organizations are active in Iceland,
 including Amnesty International. The Government and populace
 of Iceland support international efforts to improve human
 rights.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Iceland's ethnically homogeneous population is fiercely
 egalitarian and opposed to discrimination regardless of
 whether it is based on sex, religion, or other factors.
 Although women have long participated freely in the nation's
 social, economic, and political life, they nevertheless
 continue to be underrepresented in the professions,
 management, and politics.
 Women in all of Iceland's political parties are continuing
 efforts to expand their roles and power. In the April 1987
 parliamentary election, the Women's List succeeded in raising
 its share of the popular vote to 10.1 percent, compared with
 5.5 percent in the 1983 election, and won six seats in
 Parliament, compared with three in the previous election. As
 
 
 1099
 ICELAND
 a result, women now hold 13 out of 63 seats in the Althing. A
 woman holds 1 of the 11 Cabinet ministries, and Iceland's
 popularly elected Chief of State, the President, is a woman.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Workers and employers in Iceland make extensive use- of the
 rights to (a) establish organizations, (b) draw up their own
 constitutions and rules, (c) choose their own leaders and
 policies, and (d) publicize their views. The resulting
 organizations are not controlled by the Government or any
 single political party but instead reflect the views of their
 members. Icelandic unions participate activeIy in European
 and international trade union organizations.
 With the exception of limited categories of workers in the
 public sector whose services are essential to public health or
 safety (e.g., air traffic controllers), unions have possessed
 and used the right to strike under the law in Iceland for many
 years. However, the right to strike was abridged through
 April 10, 1989, when the Government of Iceland promulgated a
 provisional law on May 20, 1988, intended to cool down the
 overheated economy.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 Over 90 percent of all eligible workers in Iceland are in
 unions. There are no impediments to union membership in law
 or in practice. Virtually all unions utilize the right to
 bargain collectively on wages, working conditions, and related
 issues. Labor legislation and practive are uniform throughout
 Iceland. A system of labor courts adjudicates disputes over
 labor contracts and over the rights and provisions guaranteed
 under the 1938 Act on Trade Unions and Industrial Disputes.
 Under the provisional law of May 20, 1988, those unions which
 had not yet concluded labor contracts were prohibited from
 making agreements giving workers larger increases in wages and
 benefits than the contracts concluded prior to May 20. The
 provisional law also set aside through April 10, 1989, any
 provisions of labor contracts.which would have permitted
 workers to cancel or renegotiate these contracts in the event
 that the consumer price index exceeded the predicted levels
 (called red lines) on specified, quarterly dates. (Red line
 provisions are common in Icelandic labor contracts.) The
 Icelandic Federation of Labor (IFL) protested this law
 publicly and sent a complaint to the International Labor
 Organization (ILO) citing all three provisions as
 infringements of workers rights. In July the ILO formally
 requested the Government's position and views on the IFL
 complaint. To date, the Government has not responded.
 On August 26, 1988, the Government promulgated another
 provisional law affecting many labor contracts. This law
 froze wages and prices through September 30, 1988. A third
 provisional law, promulgated on September 28, extended this
 freeze through February 15, 1989, thereby depriving most
 workers of two or more wage increases scheduled under existing
 labor contracts. The IFL publicly protested these laws.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Forced or compulsory labor does not exist in Iceland.

 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Forced or compulsory labor does not exist in Iceland.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 The employment of children below the age of 16 in factories,
 on ships, and in other places which are hazardous or require
 hard labor is prohibited by law, and this prohibition is
 observed in practice.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 Icelandic workers are protected by laws which effectively
 ensure their health and safety as well as guarantee them
 unemployment insurance, paid vacations, pensions, and
 reasonable working conditions and hours. Although there is no
 minimum wage law, union membership is so pervasive and
 effective that labor contracts, in effect, guarantee even the
 lowest paid workers a sufficient income to give them and their
 families decent living conditions. Food, shelter, health
 care, and education are all guaranteed without discrimination
 to those lacking adequate income because they are too old, too
 young, sick, or otherwise disadvantaged.
