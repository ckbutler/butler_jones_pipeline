 LEBANON
 Lebanon is a parliamentary republic in which the President is by tradition a
 Maronite Christian, the Prime Minister a Sunni Muslim, and the Speaker of the
 Chamber of Deputies a Shi'a Muslim. The Parliament consists of 128 deputies,
 equally divided between Christian and Muslim representatives. In October Par-
 liament chose a new president, Emile Lahoud, in an election heavily influenced by
 Syria. He took office in November. The judiciary is independent in principle but is
 subject to political pressure.
 Non-Lebanese military forces control much of the country. These include about
 25,000 Syrian troops, a contingent of approximately 2,000 Israeli army regulars and
 1,500 Israeli-supported militia in the south, and several armed Palestinian factions
 located in camps and subject to restrictions on their movements. All undermine the
 authority of the central Government and prevent the application of law in the patch-
 work of areas not under the Government's control. In 1991 the governments of Syria
 and Lebanon concluded a security agreement that provided a framework for security
 cooperation between their armed forces. However, an undetermined number of Syr-
 ian military intelligence personnel in Lebanon continue to conduct their activities
 independently of the agreement.
 In 1989 the Arab League brokered a peace settlement at Taif, Saudi Arabia, to
 end the civil war in Lebanon. According to the Taif Accord, Syrian troops were to
 be redeployed from their positions in Lebanon's coastal population areas to the Biqa
 Valley, with full withdrawal contingent upon the fulfiliment of other aspects of the
 Taif Accord and subsequent agreement by both the Lebanese and Syrian govern-
 ments. Although the Syrian Government has refused to carry out this withdrawal
 from the coastal areas, strong Syrian influence over Lebanese politics and decision-
 makers makes Lebanese officials unwilling to press for a complete withdrawal. The
 relationship with Syria does not reflect the will of most Lebanese citizens.
 Israel exerts control in and near its self-proclaimed "security zone" in south Leb-
 anon through direct military action and support for its surrogate, the South Leb-
 anon Army (SLA). With the tacit support of the Government, the Iranian-backed
 Shi'a Muslim faction Hizballah, and, to a much lesser extent, the Lebanese Shi'a
 group Amal and some Palestinian guerrillas continue to be locked in a cycle of at-
 tack and counterattack with Israeli and SLA troops. Palestinian groups operate au-
 tonomously in refugee camps throughout the country. During the year, the Govern-
 ment continued to consolidate its authority in the parts of the country under its con-
 trol, and continued to take tentative steps to exert its authority in the Biqa' Valley
 and Beirut's southern suburbs. However, it did not attempt to reassert state control
 over the Palestinian refugee camps, nor to disarm Hizballah and the SLA.
 The security forces consist of the Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF), which may arrest
 and detain suspects on national security grounds; the Internal Security Forces
 (ISF), which enforce laws, conduct searches and arrests, and refer cases to the judi-
 ciary; and the State Security Apparatus and the Surete Generale, both of which col-
 lect information on groups that may jeopardize state security. The Surete Generale
 is also responsible for the issuance of passports and residency permits and for cen-
 soring foreign periodicals and movies that address national security issues. The se-
 curity forces committed serious human rights abuses.
 Before the 1975-90 hostilities, Lebanon was an important regional financial and
 commercial center. There is a market-based economy in which the majority of the
 work force is employed in the services sector, such as banking and commerce. There
 is a small industrial sector, based largely on clothing manufacture and food process-
 ing. The gross national product is estimated to be approximately $5,000 per capita.
 A reconstruction effort, begun in 1992, is moving forward. Lebanon receives sub-
 stantial remittances from abroad that offset its trade deficit and result in a balance
 of payments surplus.
 The Government's human rights record was poor, and serious problems remain
 in several areas, although there were some improvements in a few areas toward the
 end of the year. Members of the security forces used excessive force and tortured
 and abused some detainees. Prison conditions remained poor. Government abuses
 also included the arbitrary arrest and detention of persons who opposed government
 policies. Lengthy pretrial detention and long delays in trial are problems, and the
 courts are subject to political pressure. The Government infringed on citizens' pri-
 vacy rights. The Government also partially limited press freedom by continuing to
 
 
 1742
 restrict radio and television broadcasting in a discriminatory manner. It also barred
 the satellite broadcast of political programming, but later rescinded the restriction
 on news broadcasts. Journalists practice self censorship. The Government continued
 to restrict freedom of assembly, but lifted its ban on political demonstrations. The
 Government imposes limits on freedom of movement. The right of citizens to change
 their Government remains restricted by lack of government control over parts of the
 country, shortcomings in the electoral system, and Syrian influence. Although the
 1996 parliamentary elections represented a step forward, the electoral process was
 flawed, as the elections were not prepared or carried out impartially. However, in
 May and June the Government held the first municipal elections in 35 years, allow-
 ing citizens to change their government at the local level. In October Parliament
 elected a new president in keeping with the constitutional process, though the elec-
 tion was influenced heavily by Syria. Discrimination against women and Palestin-
 ians, and violence against women are problems.
 Although the civil war ended in 1990, life and property still are threatened by ar-
 tillery and aerial attacks by the various contending forces in parts of southern Leb-
 anon. These forces continue to commit abuses, including killings, bombings, and ab-
 ductions.
 The SLA maintains a separate and arbitrary system of justice in the Israeli-con-
 trolled zone, which is independent of Lebanese central authority. During the year,
 SLA officials arbitrarily arrested, mistreated, and detained persons, and regularly
 expelled local residents from their homes in the zone. Palestinian groups in refugee
 camps maintain a separate, often arbitrary, system of justice for other Palestinians.
 Palestinians sometimes may appeal to Lebanese authorities, often through their
 agents in the camps, for legal recourse. In comparison to previous years, there were
 no known reports that members of the various groups that control the camps tor-
 tured and detained their Palestinian rivals.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political or
 extrajudicial killings by government authorities during the year.
 There were no developments in the 1994 death of Tareq Hassaniyeh, who alleg-
 edly was beaten to death by authorities in the Bayt Al-Din prison, nor in the 1994
 death of Fawzi Al-Racy, who died while in the custody of the Ministry of Defense.
 There were reports of politically motivated killings of liquor store owners in Sidon
 by extremist groups.
 In July the military prosecutor charged 18 members of the Lebanese Forces, an
 outlawed rightwing Christian militia, with carrying out a 1996 bus bombing in
 Syria that killed 11 persons.
 On April 16, in a setback for government efforts to bring those responsible for ter-
 rorist attacks during the war years to justice, the Criminal Court of Beirut found
 Tawfiq Mohammad Farroukh not guilty of murder for his role in the 1976 assas-
 sination of U.S. Ambassador Francis Meloy, Embassy officer Robert Waring, and
 their driver Zohair Moghrabi despite overwhelming evidence of his guilt. Farroukh
 returned to Lebanon on April 15 and was set free after the court verdict was issued.
 The Public Prosecutor's office appealed the verdict, but no date has been set for a
 trial hearing.
 There were no developments in the 1996 beating death of Akram Arbeed, who al-
 legedly was attacked while accompanying a candidate in the 1996 parliamentary
 election. The case still is pending. Legal proceedings during the year against Samir
 Ja'ja (who still is serving a life sentence for other crimes) for his alleged complicity
 in the killing of Rashid Karame continued during the year.
 A number of persons were killed by gunfire, artillery fire, and bombs in clashes
 between Israeli soldiers and Hizballah guerrillas (see Section 1.g.).
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 The Government still has taken no judicial action against groups known to be re-
 sponsible for the kidnapings of thousands of persons during the unrest between
 1975 and 1990.
 In March Bashir Al-Khatib, who had disappeared in 1996, was returned to Leb-
 anon from Syria (see Section 1.d.). The whereabouts of Boutros Khawand, who alleg-
 edly was abducted by Syrian forces in 1992, remain unknown; he is presumed to
 be held in Syria (see Section 1.d.).
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Torture is not banned specifically by the Constitution, and there continued to be
 credible reports that security forces abused detainees and in some instances used
 torture. In June the Chairman of the Lebanese Association for Human Rights told
 
 
 1743
 the Parliamentary Commission for Human Rights that torture is still a common
 practice. In May two stateless Bedouin were executed for complicity in a murder.
 The court noted during the sentencing that their confessions were extracted through
 abusive interrogation techniques contrary to law, but their appeal was denied on
 procedural grounds. There were also credible reports that military intelligence offi-
 cials used harsh interrogation procedures, including torture, on former members of
 the Lebanese Forces. Violent abuse usually occurs during the preliminary investiga-
 tions that are conducted at the police station or military installations, where sus-
 pects are interrogated in the absence of an attorney.
 Abuses also occurred in areas outside the state's authority, including the Palestin-
 ian refugee camps. In comparison to previous years, there were no reports that
 members of the various groups that control the camps tortured and detained their
 Palestinian rivals.
 Prison conditions are poor and do not meet international standards. The Ministry
 of Interior operates 18 prisons with a total capacity of 2,000 inmates. However, pris-
 ons are overcrowded, with a total population of nearly 5,000. Inmates lack heat,
 adequate toilet and shower facilities, and proper medical care. The Government has
 not budgeted funds to rehabilitate the prison system.
 On April 8, inmates of the Roumieh prison-the largest in the country with al-
 most 75 percent of the total prison population-rioted over alleged brutality and
 mistreatment. The unrest abated only after the Interior Minister visited the prem-
 ises and promised to respond to the inmates' demands. The Minister reportedly said
 that 80 percent of the prisoners' demands would be met, since they were valid. The
 military prosecutor charged one 1SF officer and one noncommissioned officer for al-
 leged physical abuse of prisoners in the incident that triggered the riot. Trial still
 is pending. In May a prisoner in Zahle prison suffered a ruptured appendix and was
 refused medical care for more than 2 months. He nearly died before his case was
 brought to the attention of the media and the Parliament's Human Rights Commis-
 sion.
 In addition to regular prisons, the Surete Generale, which mans border posts, op-
 erates a detention facility. Hundreds of foreigners, mostly Egyptians and Sri
 Lankans, are detained there pending deportation. They reportedly are held in small,
 poorly ventilated cells. Credible reports indicate that in 1997 guards raped some of
 the Sri Lankan women during their detention.
 On June 6, the International Prison Watch (IPW)-a human rights organization
 based in Lyon, France-was allowed to visit prisons in Lebanon. The IPW represent-
 ative in Lebanon visited the Roumieh prison and stated that conditions have im-
 proved but noted that the prison is still overcrowded. Local journalists and human
 rights organizations had access certain prisons during the year; access to those pris-
 ons controlled by the Ministry of Defense was not given.
 Hizballah detains and reportedly mistreats SLA members and suspected agents
 at unknown locations. The SLA operates its own detention facility, AI-Khiam prison,
 and there are frequent allegations of torture and mistreatment of detainees. Both
 groups occasionally release prisoners. In June the International Commission of the
 Red Cross (ICRC) brokered an exchange of prisoners and prisoners' remains among
 Israel, Lebanon, Hizballah, and the SLA. In exchange for the remains of an Israeli
 sergeant who was killed in a military operation in Lebanon in September 1997,
 Israel and the SLA released 65 prisoners, and returned the remains of 40 Hizballah
 guerrillas. In September the SLA released Suha Bichara, a member of the Com-
 munist Party who had attempted to kill the SLA leader, General Lahd, 10 years
 previously.
 Hizballah does not permit prison visits by human rights monitors. The SLA, after
 a 9-month period of not permitting visitations, allowed the ICRC (and family mem-
 bers) to visit detainees at Al-Khiam prison following the prisoner exchange in June.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Government uses arbitrary arrest
 and detention. The law requires security forces to obtain warrants of arrest before
 making arrests. However, military prosecutors, who are responsible for cases involv-
 ing the military, as well as those involving espionage, treason, weapons possession,
 and draft evasion, make arrests without warrants. Arresting officers are required
 to refer a suspect to a prosecutor within 24 hours of arrest, but frequently do not
 do so.
 The law requires the authorities to release suspects after 48 hours of arrest if no
 formal charges are brought against them. Some prosecutors flout this requirement
 and detain suspects for long periods in pretrial confinement without a court order.
 The law authorizes judges to remand suspects to incommunicado detention for 10
 days with a possible extension for an additional 10 days. Bail is only available to
 those accused of petty crimes, not those accused of felonies. Defendants have the
 
 
 1744
 
 right to legal counsel, but there is no public defender's office. The Bar Association
 has an office to assist those who cannot afford a lawyer.
 Security forces continued the practice of arbitrary arrest. After a June 19 car
 bomb explosion in Dora, security forces detained and interrogated scores of citizens,
 predominately Christian supporters of the jailed commander of the Lebanese Forces,
 Samir Jaja. These detentions and searches of homes took place without warrants,
 and detainees claim that they were not given access to lawyers. Most detainees were
 released  after they were forced to sign documents stating that they would abstain
 from politics. Eighteen of those allegedly connected directly to the Dora bombing
 were charged with forming a sabotage network. Of the 18 charged, 11 are in custody
 and 7 are still at large.
 There were no allegations during the year of the transfer of Lebanese citizens by
 Lebanese authorities to Syria. In 1997 there reportedly was one such instance in
 which Lebanese security forces allegedly were involved. The number of Lebanese de-
 tainees remaining in Syria is uncertain; however, former President Elias Hrawi esti-
 mated that some 210 persons were in Syrian custody in 1996. Amnesty Inter-
 national (AI) reported that "hundreds of Lebanese, Palestinians, and Jordanians
 have been arbitrarily arrested, some over 2 decades ago, and remain in prolonged
 and often secret detention is Syria." According to AI, Syrian forces operating in Leb-
 anon carried out searches, arrests, and detentions of Lebanese nationals outside of
 any legal framework.
 On March 6-7, Syria transferred 121 prisoners, most of whom had been held in
 Syrian jails since the outbreak of the Lebanese civil war in 1975, to the Lebanese
 authorities. The transfer, which included a detainee named Bashir Al-Khatib who
 had disappeared in 1996, was ordered by Syrian President Hafez Al-Assad at the
 request of President Elias Hrawi. Fourteen of those released were to be referred to
 a Lebanese court. Lebanese political figure Boutros Khawand, who allegedly was ab-
 ducted by Syrian forces in 1992, remains unaccounted for and is presumed to be
 held in detention in Syria.
 The authorities often detain without charge for short periods of time political op-
 ponents of the Syrian and Lebanese Governments. Syrian forces in Lebanon also re-
 portedly detain Lebanese citizens.
 Local militias and non-Lebanese forces continued to conduct arbitrary arrests in
 areas outside central government control. The SLA detains an estimated 120 citi-
 zens and an undetermined number of Palestinians at Al-Khiam prison in the south.
 Israel holds several Lebanese citizens, including Sheikh Abed Al-Karim Obaid and
 Mustafa Dirani, figures associated with the Islamic resistance. In November the
 SLA acted on behalf of the Israeli Defense Force (IDF) and abducted Sheikh Abbas
 Mohsen Fadlallah from his home in Kafr Kila. He was detained at Al-Khiam prison
 for his alleged role in resistance activity.
 Palestinian refugees are subject to arrest, detention, and harassment by the state
 security forces, Syrian forces, various militias, and rival Palestinians.
 Exile as a form of punishment is not practiced regularly, although in 1991 the
 Government pardoned former Army Commander General Michel 'Awn and two of
 his aides on the condition that they depart the country and remain in exile for 5
 years. 'Awn was accused of usurping power. The 5-year period ended in August 1996
 ut 'Awn remains in France.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The judiciary is independent in principle, but is
 subject to political pressure. The Constitution provides for a constitutional council
 to supervise the constitutionality of laws and stipulates that judges shall be inde-
 pendent in the exercise of their duties; however, influential politicians and Syrian
 intelligence officers sometimes intervene to protect their supporters from prosecu-
 tion.
 The judicial system is composed of the regular civilian courts; the Military Court,
 which tries cases involving military personnel and military-related issues; the Judi-
 cial Council, which tries national security offenses; and the tribunals of the various
 confessions, that is, religious affiliations, which adjudicate disputes including mar-
 riage, inheritance, and personal status.
 The Judicial Council is a permanent tribunal of five senior judges that adjudicates
 threats to national security. On the recommendation of the Minister of Justice, the
 Cabinet decides whether to try a case before this tribunal.
 The Ministry of Justice appoints judges according to a formula based on the reli-
 gious affiliation of the prospective judge. A shortage of judges has impeded efforts
 to adjudicate cases backlogged during the years of internal conflicts. Trial delays
 also are caused by the Government's inability to conduct investigations in areas out-
 side its control. Defendants have the right to examine evidence against them. The
 testimony of a woman is equal to that of a man.
 
 
 1745
 Hizballah applies Islamic law in areas under its control. Palestinian groups in ref-
 ugee camps operate an autonomous and arbitrary system of justice. The SLA main-
 tains a separate and arbitrary system of justice.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-While
 the authorities generally show little interest in controlling the personal lives of citi-
 zens, they readily interfere with the privacy of persons regarded as foes of the Gov-
 ernment. Laws require that prosecutors obtain warrants before entering houses ex-
 cept when the army is in hot pursuit of an armed attacker. However, after a car
 bomb explosion in June, security forces searched homes without warrants.
 The Government and Syrian intelligence services use informer networks and mon-
 itor telephones to gather information on their adversaries. The army Intelligence
 Service monitors the movement and activities of members of opposition groups (see
 Section 2.b.). The Government concedes that tlep hone calls are wiretapped by secu-
 rity services. The Parliamentary Commission  at was formed by the speaker in
 1997 to investigate wiretelephone tapping concluded its investigation, but its find-
 ings have not been made public.
 Militias and non-Lebanese forces operating outside the area of central government
 authority frequently have violated citizens' privacy rights. Various factions also use
 informer networks and monitor telephones to obtain information on their adversar-
 ies.
 On March 31, the Israeli forces reportedly expelled a woman and her child from
 the village of Ramia, located in Israel s self-declared security zone.
 On May 19, Israeli intelligence services and the SLA reportedly expelled a Leba-
 nese couple from the village of Shab'a. Israeli forces also reportedly expelled a Leba-
 nese woman and her three children from the village of Adayse on August 1. In Sep-
 tember two Druze religious figures and their spouses were expelled from their
 homes in the Israeli-occupied zone.
 g. Use of Excessive Force and Violations of Humanitarian Law in Internal Con-
 flicts.-According to various reports, an estimated 37 Islamic resistance guerrillas,
 20 Israeli soldiers and 22 Lebanese civilians were killed in south Lebanon during
 the year, as Hizballah, Areal, and Palestinian guerrillas on the one hand, and
 Israeli forces and the SLA on the other, engaged in recurring violence. Hizballah
 attacked SLA and Israeli troops deployed on Lebanese soil. For example, Hizballah
 forces killed Israeli soldiers in bomb attacks in July, August, and October. In Au-
 gust Hizballah launched rocket attacks against northern Israel, ostensibly in retal-
 iation for SLA shelling of Lebanese villages. Israeli forces conducted repeated air
 strikes and artillery barrages on Hizballah, Amal, and Palestinian targets inside
 Lebanon. For example, in August Israeli planes fired rockets at suspected Hizballah
 positions in the south. In December an Israeli jet bombed a home in eastern Leb-
 anon, killing a woman and her six children. In retaliation, Hizballah fired dozens
 of rockets into northern Israel, wounding 12 civilians.
 In south Lebanon, there is an average of two or three attacks daily against IDF/
 SLA military positions with a similar number of IDF/SLA counter attacks.
 The Israel-Lebanon Monitoring Group continued to deal with alleged violations of
 the April 1996 understanding between Israel and Hizballah not to target civilians
 or to launch attacks from civilian-populated areas.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of the
 press, but the Government partially limits this right in practice, particularly by in-
 timidating journalists and broadcasters into practicing self-censorship. In January
 the Government banned satellite broadcasts of political programs and news originat-
 ing from Lebanon. In September the Government rescinded the total ban on sat-
 ellite news broadcasts, but continued to ban satellite broadcasts of political talk
 shows and to censor television broadcasts on a case-by-case basis.
 Lebanon has a long history of freedom of opinion, speech, and the press. Although
 there were repeated attempts to restrict these freedoms during the year, daily criti-
 cism of government policies and leaders continued. Dozens of newspapers and hun-
 dreds of periodicals are published throughout the country, financed by various local
 and foreign groups. While the press is normally independent, press content often re-
 flects the opinions of these financial backers.
 The Government has several tools at its disposal to control freedom of expression.
 The Surete Generale is authorized to approve all foreign magazines and non-periodi-
 cal works including plays, books, and films before they are distributed in the mar-
 ket. The law prohibits attacks on the dignity of the Head of State or foreign leaders.
 The Government may prosecute offending journalists and publications in the Publi-
 cations Court, a special court empowered to try such matters.
 
 
 1746
 Moreover, the 1991 security agreement between Lebanon and Syria contains a
 provision that effectively prohibits the publication of any information deemed harm-
 ful to the security of either state. In view of the risk of prosecution, Lebanese jour-
 nalists censor themselves on matters related to Syria.
 During the year, the Government -restricted press freedom by filing charges
 against several newspapers. In February the Government indicted the newspaper
 A-Diyar three times for defaming the President of the Republic, the Prime Minister,
 and the judiciary. If convicted, the newspaper would have to pay a fine of $35,000
 (52,500,000 Lebanese pounds) for each case. In January the Supreme Court, in an
 irrevocable decision, endorsed a 1997 verdict issued by the Publication Court sen-
 tencing the editor in chief of the daily A1-Kifah Al-Arabi to pay a fine of $30,000
 (45,000,000 Lebanese pounds) for publishing an article deemed insulting to the King
 of Saudi Arabia.
 In April the Government charged an editor of the daily A1-Diyar with publishing
 false information and untrue allegations likely to undermine the nationa currency.
 In May the judiciary summoned, without a subpoena, a writer for the An-Nahar
 daily newspaper for questioning about a story she wrote about conditions at the cen-
 tral prison in Roumieh.
 In June the military prosecutor charged in absentia An-Nahar journalist Pierre
 Attallah, who previously had been granted asylum in France, with defaming the ju-
 diciary and entering Israel. A court hearing is still pending.
 Between May and July, the Government blocked television transmission of two
 political talk shows. One of the shows was to have been conducted on the eve of
 the municipal election with the general coordinator of the National Gathering, an
 opposition group loyal to exiled General Michel 'Awn. The second show, an interview
 with the self-exiled leader of the National Bloc, Raymond Edde, was forced to delay
 its broadcast. In August and September, the Government pressured the owner of a
 media outlet to sell a portion of his controlling interest in the company to other
 shareholders. In November Reporters Without Borders, a Paris-based NGO, criti-
 cized the legal proceedings taken against Murr Television journalist Tony
 Shamiyah, who was sentenced to 1 year in prison for collaborating with Israelis.
 Lebanon has a strong tradition of academic freedom and a flourishing private edu-
 cational system (a result of inadequate public schools and a preference for religious
 affiliation). Students exercise the right to form campus associations, and the Gov-
 ernment usually does not interfere with student groups.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-Although the Constitution pro-
 vides for freedom of assembly, the Government restricts this right. Any group wish-
 ing to organize a rally must obtain the prior approval of the Interior Ministry, which
 does not render decisions consistently. The Government lifted its long-standing de-
 cree banning all demonstrations in December. Within days of that decision, the Gov-
 ernment granted permission for a demonstration to protest U.S. and UK air strikes
 against Iraq. During a time of Syrian-Turkish tensions, the Government permitted
 a peaceful protest rally to be staged in front of the Turkish Embassy. Environ-
 mental groups also have been given some of latitude in holding protest and aware-
 ness campaigns.
 The Constitution provides for freedom of association, and the Government gen-
 erally respects this right and does not interfere with the establishment of private
 organizations. The law requires that persons forming organizations notify the Inte-
 rior Ministry, which should then issue a "receipt" acknowledging that proper notifi-
 cation was given. In practice, the "receipt" has evolved into a permit, which can be
 withheld by the Ministry.
 The Ministry of Interior also scrutinizes requests to establish political movements
 or parties, and to some extent monitors their activities. The army Intelligence Serv-
 ice monitors the movement and activities of members of opposition groups.
 Neither Israel nor Syria allows groups openly hostile to them to operate in areas
 under their control.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the
 Government respects this right in practice.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Constitution provides for these rights, and the Government gen-
 erally respects them in practice. However, there are some limitations. Travel to
 Israel is prohibited by law, but commonly occurs via Israeli-occupied territory in
 southern Lebanon. All males between 18 and 21 years of age are subject to compul-
 sory military service and are required to register at a recruitment office and obtain
 a travel authorization document before leaving the country. Husbands may block
 foreign travel by their wives and minor children (see Section 5).
 Lebanese Armed Forces and Syrian troops maintain checkpoints in areas under
 their control. In south Lebanon, the Lebanese army, the Israeli army, and the SLA
 
 
 1747
 
 maintain tight restrictions on the movement of people and goods into and out of
 Israel's self-declared security zone. On October 1, the SLA implemented new restric-
 tions which required Jezzine residents to apply 48 hours in advance to leave the
 area.
 There are no legal restrictions on the right of all citizens to return. Many emigres,
 however, are reluctant to return for a variety of political, economic, and social rea-
 sons. The Government has encouraged the return to their homes of over 600,000
 persons displaced during the civil war. Although some persons have began to re-
 claim homes abandoned or damaged during the war, the vast majority of displaced
 persons have not attempted to reclaim and rehabilitate their property. The resettle-
 ment process is slowed by tight budgetary constraints, shattered infrastructure, the
 lack of schools and economic opportunities, and the fear that physical security is
 still incomplete in some parts of the country.
 Most non-Lebanese refugees are Palestinians. The United Nations Relief and
 Works Agency (UNRWA) reported that the number of Palestinian refugees in Leb-
 anon registered with the UNRWA was 364,551. This figure, while it includes only
 the families of refugees who arrived in 1948, also is presumed to include many thou-
 sands who reside outside the country. Most experts estimate the actual number now
 in Lebanon to be fewer than 300,000.
 The Government issues laissez-passers (travel documents) to Palestinian refugees
 to enable them to travel and work abroad. However, after the Government of Libya
 announced in September 1995 its intention to expel Palestinians working in that
 country, the Lebanese Government prohibited the return of Palestinians living
 abroad unless they obtained an entry visa. The Government maintained that the
 visa requirement is necessary to ensure the validity of a Lebanese laissez-passer,
 because a large number of those documents were forged during the years of strife.
 The effect has been to discourage foreign travel by Palestinians resident in Lebanon.
 There are no legal provisions for granting asylum or refugee status in accordance
 with the 1951 U.N. Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees and its 1967 Pro-
 tocol. The Government does not grant first asylum; however, in practice the Govern-
 ment grants admission and temporary (6 months) refuge to asylum seekers, but not
 permanent asylum. There are nearly 3,600 non-Palestinian refugees (mostly Iraqi
 Shi'a and Kurds) residing in Lebanon according to the United Nations High Com-
 missioner for Refugees (UNHCR). There have been no known requests for asylum
 since 1975. The Government cooperates with the offices of the UNHCR and the
 UNRWA. There were no reports of the forced return of persons to a country where
 they feared persecution.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The Constitution states that citizens have the right to change their government
 in periodic free and fair elections; however, lack of government control over parts
 of the country, defects in the electoral process, and strong Syrian influence over Leb-
 anese politics and decisionmakers significantly restrict this right. The 1996 par-
 liamentary elections represented a step forward, but the electoral process was
 flawed by serious shortcomings, because the elections were not prepared or carried
 out impartially. Government officials acknowledged some of the electoral short-
 comings and pledged to correct them in future elections.
 According to the Constitution, elections for the Parliament must be held every 4
 years. The Parliament, in turn, elects the President every 6 years. The President
 and Parliament nominate the Prime Minister, who, with the President, chooses the
 Cabinet. According to the unwritten "National Pact of 1943," the President is a
 Maronite Christian, the Prime Minister a Sunni Muslim, and the speaker a Shi'a
 Muslim. Until 1990 seats in Parliament were divided according to a 6 to 5 ratio of
 Christians to Muslims. Under the National Reconciliation Agreement reached in
 Taif, Saudi Arabia in 1989, Members of Parliament agreed to alter the national pact
 to create a 50-50 balance between Christian and Muslim members of Parliament.
 The Taif accord also increased the number of seats in Parliament and transferred
 some powers from the President to the Prime Minister and the Cabinet.
 In May and June, the Government held the first elections at the local level since
 1963. The elections were reasonably free and fair, and citizens were able to choose
 their own representatives at the local level. No serious discrepancies were reported.
 However, six persons were wounded in June when supporters of rival candidates
 clashed with knives and clubs. Police arrested 30 persons in the fighting, which
 broke out in Zahle and Tripoli.
 On October 15, the Parliament elected a new President after.amending the Con-
 stitution on a one-time basis to permit senior government officials, including the
 (then) commander of the army, to run for office. (The Constitution prohibits senior
 
 
 1748
 
 government officials from running for president unless they resign at least 2 years
 before the election. The amendment provided for a one-time exception to this provi-
 sion.) There was substantial criticism of the Syrian role in influencing Lebanese po-
 litical leaders in the selection of the presidential candidate; however, there was
 broad popular support for the new President. President Emile Lahoud took office in
 November.
 Women have the right to vote and there are no legal barriers to their participa-
 tion in politics, although there are significant cultural barriers. Women are under-
 represented in government and politics. No women hold cabinet positions. Three
 women were elected to the 128-seat Parliament in 1996.
 Palestinian refugees have no political rights. An estimated 17 Palestinian factions
 operate in Lebanon, generally organized around prominent individuals. Most Pal-
 estinians live in refugee camps controlled by one or more factions. The leaders of
 the refugees are not elected, but there are "popular committees" that meet regularly
 with the UNRWA and other visitors.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Several local human rights groups operate freely without overt government re-
 striction, including the Lebanese Association for Human Rights, the Foundation for
 Human and Humanitarian Rights-Lebanon, and the National Association for the
 Rights of the Disabled. Some of these groups have sought to publicize the detention
 in Syria of hundreds of Lebanese citizens, and took credit in part for the release
 of a number of Lebanese from Syrian jails during the year (see Section 1.d.). The
 bar association and other private organizations regularly hold public events that in-
 clude discussion of human rights issues. Some human rights groups have reported
 harassment and intimidation by government, Syrian, and militia forces.
 In general the Government is reluctant to discuss human rights problems with
 foreign governmental or non-governmental organizations. However, it has facilitated
 visits to the country of Amnesty International representatives to report on Israeli
 activities in south Lebanon. In June the Government also permitted International
 Prison Watch to visit prisons (see Section 1.c.).
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution calls for "social justice and equality of duties and rights among
 all citizens without prejudice or favoritism." In practice, aspects of the law and tra-
 ditional mores discriminate against women. Religious discrimination is built into
 the political system. During 1997 the Parliament approved a law giving preferences
 to the disabled for employment in government positions. Discrimination based on
 race, language, or social status is illegal and not widespread among citizens; how-
 ever, foreign household servants are often mistreated.
 Women.-Violence against women is a problem. The press reports cases of rape
 with increasing frequency, and cases reported are thought to be only a fraction of
 the actual number. In October the rape of a young girl in the village of Shehim-
 allegedly by a Syrian migrant-caused widespread reprisals agalnst Syrian laborers
 living in the region. There are no authoritative statistics on the extent of spousal
 abuse. Most experts agree that the problem affects a significant portion of the fe-
 male population. In general battered or abused women do not talk about their suf-
 fering for fear of bringing shame upon their own families or accusations of mis-
 behavior upon themselves. Doctors and social workers believe that most abused
 women do not seek medical help. The Government has no separate program to pro-
 vide medical assistance to battered women. It provides legal assistance to victims
 of crimes who cannot afford it regardless of the gender of the victim. The Lebanese
 Association for Combating Violence Against Women, founded in 1994, has been ac-
 tive in lobbying to improve the socio-economic condition of women and to reduce vio-
 lence against women.
 The legal system is discriminatory in its handling of "crimes of honor." According
 to the Penal Code, a man who kills his wife or other female relative may receive
 a reduced sentence if he demonstrates that he committed the crime in response to
 an illegitimate sexual relationship conducted.by the victim. However, beginning in
 1991, the Government began to increase sentences on violent crimes in general and
 to seek punishment for men who commit "crimes of honor."
 Women have employment opportunities in government, medicine, law, academia,
 the arts, and to a lesser degree, business. However, social pressure against women
 pursuing careers is strong in some parts of society. Men sometimes exercise consid-
 erable control over female relatives, restricting their activities outside the home or
 their contact with friends and relatives. Women may own property but often cede
 
 
 1749
 
 control of it to male relatives for cultural reasons. In 1994 the parliament removed
 a legal stipulation that a women must obtain her husband's approval to open a busi-
 ness or engage in a trade. Husbands may block foreign travel by their wives (see
 Section 2.d.).
 Only men may confer citizenship on their spouses and children. Accordingly, chil-
 dren born to Lebanese mothers and foreign fathers are not eligible for Lebanese citi-
 zenship. In late 1995, the Parliament approved a law allowing Lebanese widows to
 confer citizenship on their minor children.
 Religious groups administer their own family and personal status laws. There are
 18 recognized groups, each of which differs in its treatment of marriage, family
 property rights, and inheritance. Many of these laws discriminate against women.
 For example, Sunni inheritance law gives a son twice the share of a daughter. Al-
 though Muslim men may divorce easily, Muslim women may do so only with the
 concurrence of their husbands.
 Children.-The plight of children remains a serious concern; however, the Govern-
 ment has not allocated funds to protect them. Education is not compulsory and illit-
 eracy rates have reached 37.5 percent. Many children, particularly in rural areas,
 take jobs at a young age to help support their families. In lower income families,
 boys generally get more education, while girls usually remain at home to do house-
 work.
 An undetermined number of children are neglected, abused, exploited, and even
 sold to adoption agents. There are hundreds of abandoned children in the streets
 nationwide, some of whom survive by begging, others by working at low wages.
 Juvenile delinquency is on the rise; many delinquents wait in ordinary prisons for
 trial and remain there after sentencing. Although their number is very small, there
 is no adequate place to hold delinquent girls, and they are held in the women's pris-
 on in Ba'abda. Limited financial resources have hindered efforts to build adequate
 facilities to rehabilitate delinquents. However, during the year a prominent private
 citizen has agreed to provide land in Junieh to build a juvenile center for girls, and
 work is underway. There is also a project to build a modern juvenile detention facil-
 ity in Ba'asir. The Government provided a 15,000 square meter plot and is working
 with U.N. agencies to arrange for financial assistance and expertise to construct the
 facility.
 There are neither child welfare programs nor government institutions to oversee
 the implementation of children's programs. The Committee for Children's Rights,
 formed in 1993 by prominent politicians and private citizens, has been lobbying for
 legislation to improve the condition of children. The Ministry of Health requires the
 establishment of health records for every child up to 18 years of age.
 People With Disabilities.-Over 100,000 persons sustained disabilities during the
 civil war. Care of the disabled is generally a function performed by families. Most
 efforts to secure education, independence, health, and shelter for the disabled are
 made by some 100 private organizations for the disabled. In general, these organiza-
 tions are relatively active, although poorly funded.
 The heavily damaged -cities make few accommodations for the disabled. Building
 codes have no requirements for ease of access, although the Government in its re-
 building projects has constructed sidewalks in some parts of Beirut allowing access
 for the disabled. The private "Solidere" project for the reconstruction of downtown
 Beirut has self-imposed requirements for disabled access. This project is widely con-
 sidered a model for future construction efforts around the country.
 Religious Minorities.-Discrimination based on religion is built into the system of
 government (see Section 3). The amended Constitution of 1990 embraces the prin-
 ciple of abolishing religious affiliation as a criterion for filling government positions,
 but few practical steps have been taken to accomplish this. One notable exception
 is the Lebanese Armed Forces, which, through universal conscription and an empha-
 sis on professionalism, has significantly reduced the role of confessionalism (or reli-
 gious sectarianism) in that organization. Each religious group has its own courts for
 family law matters, such as marriage, divorce, child custody, and inheritance.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-According to the United Nations, an esti-
 mated 365,000 Palestinian refugees are registered in Lebanon (see Section 2.d.).
 Most Palestinian refugees live in overpopulated camps that have suffered repeated
 heavy damage as a result of fighting. The Government generally has prohibited the
 construction of permanent structures in the camps, on the grounds that such con-
 struction encourages the notion of permanent refugee settlement in Lebanon. Refu-
 gees fear that in the future the Government may reduce the size of the camps or
 eliminate them completely.
 The Government officially ended its practice of denying work permits to Palestin-
 ians in 1991. However, in practice, very few Palestinians receive work permits, and
 those who find work are usually funneled into unskilled occupations. They and other
 
 
 1750
 aliens may own a limited size plot of land but only after obtaining the approval of
 five different district offices. The law applies to all aliens, but for political, cultural,
 and economic reasons it is applied in a manner disadvantageous to Palestinians
 and, to a lesser extent, Kurds. The Government does not provide health services to
 Palestinian refugees, who rely on the UNRWA and UNRWA-contracted hospitals.
 In recent years, Palestinian incomes have declined as the Palestinian Liberation
 Organization closed many of its offices in Lebanon, which formerly employed as
 much as 50 percent of the Palestinian work force. Palestinian children reportedly
 have been forced to leave school at an early age because U.N. relief workers do not
 have sufficient funds for education programs. The U.N. estimates that 18 percent
 of street children are Palestinian. Drug addiction and crime reportedly are increas-
 ing in the camps, as is prostitution, although reliable statistics are not available.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-All workers, except government employees, may es-
 tablish and join unions and have a legal right to strike. Worker representatives
 must be chosen from those employed within the bargaining unit. About 900,000 per-
 sons form the active labor force, 42 percent of whom are members of 160 labor
 unions and associations. Twenty-two of the unions, with about 200,000 workers, are
 represented in the General Confederation of Labor (GLC).
 In general the Government does not control or restrict unions, although union
 leaders allege that the Government has tried, in the past, to interfere in elections
 for union officials. In July elections were held in the GLC for the chairmanship posi-
 tion following the resignation of the government-recognized chairman, Ghanem Al-
 Zoghbi.
 Palestinian refugees may organize their own unions, but, because of restrictions
 on their right to work, few Palestinians participate actively in trade unions.
 Unions are free to affiliate with international federations and confederations, and
 they maintain a variety of such affiliations.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The rights of workers to orga-
 nize and to bargain exists in law and practice. Most worker groups engage in some
 form of collective bargaining with their employers. Stronger federations obtain sig-
 nificant gains for their members, and on occasion have assisted nonunionized work-
 ers. There is no government mechanism to promote voluntary labor-management
 negotiations, and workers have no protection against antiunion discrimination. The
 Government's unevenly enforced ban on demonstrations arguably diminishes unions'
 bargaining power.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced labor is not prohibited by
 law. In the absence of a prohibition against it, children, foreign domestic servants,
 and other foreign workers sometimes are forced to remain in situations amounting
 to coerced or bonded labor.
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment.-The 1946
 Labor Code stipulates that workers between the ages of 8 and 16 may not work
 more than 7 hours a day, with 1 hour for rest provided after 4 hours. In July 1996,
 the Ministry of Labor amended this law to define workers under the age of 13 as
 child labor, in accordance with international obligations. Children also are prohib-
 ited from working between the hours of 7 p.m. and 6 a.m. The code also prohibits
 certain types of mechanical work for children between the ages of 8 and 13, and
 other types for those between the ages of 13 and 16. The Labor Ministry is tasked
 with enforcing these requirements, but the Ministry does not rigorously apply the
 law. Forced and bonded child labor is not prohibited and sometimes occurs (see Sec-
 tion 6.c.).
 Children between the ages of 10 and 14 comprise 0.6 percent of the labor force
 (5,936 children in total), according to the latest official figures. Most of these child
 laborers are Lebanese, but some are Syrian; they work predominantly in the indus-
 trial, craft, and metallurgical sectors. According to a UNICEF study, 60 percent of
 working children are below 13 years of age and 75 percent earn wages below two-
 thirds of the minimum wage. Nearly 40 percent of working children work 10 to 14
 hours per day and few receive social welfare benefits. In addition, 52,185 children
 between the ages of 15 and 19 are in the active labor force; they are not eligible
 for minimum wages until they reach the age of 21.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The Government sets a legal minimum wage,
 currently about $200 (300,000 Lebanese pounds) per month. The law is not enforced
 effectively in the private sector. In theory the courts could be called upon to enforce
 it, but in practice they are not. The minimum wage is insufficient to provide a de-
 cent standard of living for a worker and family. Trade unions actively try to ensure
 
 
 1751
 
 the payment of minimum wages in both the public sector and the large-scale private
 sector.
 The Labor Law prescribes a standard 6-day workweek of 48 hours, with a 24-hour
 rest period per week. In practice workers in the industrial sector work an average
 of 35 hours a week, and workers in other sectors work an average of 30 hours a
 week. The law includes specific occupational health and safety regulations. Labor
 regulations call on employers to take adequate precautions for employee safety. En-
 forcement, the responsibility of the Ministry of Labor, is uneven. Labor organizers
 report that workers do not have the right to remove themselves from hazardous con-
 ditions without jeopardizing their continued employment.
