 UZBEKISTAN
 Uzbekistan is an authoritarian state with limited civil rights. The Constitution
 provides for a presidential system with separation of powers between the executive,
 legislative, and judicial branches. In practice President Islam Karimov and the cen-
 tralized executive branch that serves him remain the dominant forces in political
 life. The Oliy Majlia (Parliament) is dominated by the executive branch, and only
 parties that support the President are represented. Although the Constitution pro-
 
 
 1390
 vides for an independent judicial authority, in practice the judicial branch is heavily
 influenced by the executive branch in civi and criminal cases.
 The police are controlled by the Ministry of Interior (MVD). The police and related
 MVD forces are responsible for most normal internal police functions. The National
 Security Service (NSS)-the former KGB-deals with a broad range of national se-
 curity questions, including corruption, organized crime, and narcotics. The army and
 border guards are responsible for external defense. They are not routinely used in
 internal disturbances and rarely are implicated in human rights abuses. The police
 and the NSS committed numerous, serious human rights abuses.
 The Government continued to move toward market reform, especially through im-
 prvement in the legislative framework. However, restrictions continue on currency
 convertibility and other financial steps which have led to suspension of international
 loans. The economy is based primarily on agriculture and agricultural processing;
 Uzbekistan is the world's fifth largest producer of cotton, the seventh largest pro-
 ducer of old and has substantial deposits of copper, strategic minerals, gas, and
 oil. The Gvernment has proclaimed its commitment to a gradual transition to a
 free market economy. It has achieved substantial progress in reducing inflation and
 the budget deficit. However, progss on privatization of the large state-owned en-
 terprises that account for the bulk of gross domestic product remained slow, and a
 host of formal and informal barriers continued to constrain the nascent private sec-
 tor.
 The Government's human rights record remained poor, and there were serious
 problems in several areas. Citizens cannot exercise their right to change their gov-
 ernment peacefully. Chosen president in a 1991 election that most observers consid-
 ered neither free nor fair, Karimov had his stay in office extended to 2000 by a 1995
 Soviet-style referendum. Parliament subsequently voted to make the extension part
 of Karimov's first term, thus making him eligible to run again in 2000. Police and
 NSS forces used torture, harassment, illegal searches, and wiretaps, and arbitrarily
 detained or arrested opposition activists on false charges. They committed these and
 other abuses against both dissidents and other citizens, although reported abuses
 against dissidents decreased sharply. Arbitrary arrest and detention is common;
 even foreigners are not exempt. Police often beat criminal suspects, and detention
 can be prolonged. Prison conditions are poor. Although the Government says that
 it investigates abuses, those responsible for documefited abuses rarely are punished.
 The judiciary does not always ensure due process and takes its direction from the
 executive branch. The Government severely limits freedom of speech and the press,
 and freedom of expression is constrained by an atmosphere of repression that makes
 it difficult to criticize the Government publicly. Although the Constitution expressly
 prohibits it, press censorship continues. The Government sharply restricts the im-
 portation of foreign print media. The Government limits freedom of assembly and
 association. The Government continues to ban unsanctioned public meetings and
 demonstrations. To control the political arena, the Government continues to deny
 registration to independent political parties and other groups potentially critical of
 the Government, and prevents unregistered opposition parties and movements from
 operating freely or publishing their views. The Government continued to decline to
 approve the registration application of the Human Rights Society of Uzbekistan,
 which has been seeking to register since 1992 citing technical deficiencies in its pa-
 perwork. The Government limits freedom of religion; it has harassed and arrested
 independent Islamic leaders on questionable grounds, citing the threat of Islamic ex-
 tremism. It has also arrested and allegedly threatened evangelical leaders, and de-
 nied registration to Christian sects it does not accept. Despite a constitutional prohi-
 bition, there continues to be significant traditional societal discrimination and do-
 mestic violence against women.
 The pace of reform slowed during the year. Nevertheless, several potentially posi-
 tive steps were taken. In April the Oliy Majlis passed legislation establishing an om-
 budsman's office. However, by year's end, the office had not yet demonstrated
 whether it could function in accordance with its legislative mandate and play an im-
 portant role in monitoring human rights abuses. The Oliy Majlis also enacted legis-
 lation reforming the penal system and protecting the rights of prisoners. In April
 new laws providing increased access to information and protection of journalists
 were passed, and a mass media law passed in December, although the effects on
 press freedom remained unclear at year's end.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political or
 other extrajudicial killings.
 
 
 1391
 The Government has never announced the results of its internal investigation into
 the 1995 death in police custody, almost certainly of a beating, of Bokhtiar Yakubov,
 a witness linked to an opposition activist.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 Nematjon Parpiev, an assistant to missing imam Abduvali Kori Mirzaev, was re-
 ported to have disappeared in August. Parpiev went to the local market to buy
 read and never returned. This event follows by two years Mirzaev's disappearance
 who, along with his assistant, allegedly was detained at the Tashkent airport by
 NSS officers while traveling to a conference in Moscow in 1995. No developments
 were reported in the disappearance of Mirzaev and his assistant.
 There were no reporteddevelopments in the investigation of the 1995 kidnappings
 of former vice president Shukrullo Mirsaidov and his son, or the November 1996
 kidnapping of another of Mirsaidov's sons. Similarly, there were no new develop-
 ments n the 1992 disappearance of Abdullah Utaev, leader of the IJzbekistan chap-
 ter of the outlawed Islamic Renaissance Party, who, most observers believe, also
 was detained by security forces. There is no official admission that either man was
 arrested or detained and no further information on their whereabouts. However,
 most independent observers believe that the three missing Islamic activists are ei-
 ther dead or in NSS custody.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Although the law prohibits these practices, police routinely beat and otherwise mis-
 treat detainees to obtain confessions. Both police and the NSS used beatings and
 harassment against citizens.
 Family members of the "Namangan 11," a group of young men who, evidence
 strongly suggests, were falsely accused of belonging to a Namangan city gang that
 committed a murder and several robberies, continue to protest the courts convic-
 tion, believing that even a reduced sentence is unjust because the defendants are
 innocent. In 1996 the Supreme Court commuted the death sentence of one defend-
 ant and reduced the sentences of the other defendants. Lawyers at the hearing pre-
 sented evidence that the defendants' confessions were obtained by beatings.
 The MVD has yet to announce the results of its internal investigation of the Au-
 gust 1996 detention of the representative of the international human rights non-
 governmental organization (NGO) Human Rights Watch/Helsinki (HRW/H) and
 have not identified who subjected him to verbal abuse and humiliating treatment
 (see Section 1.d.).
 Prison conditions are poor, and worse for male than for female prisoners. Due to
 limited resources, prison overcrowding is a problem. Reportedly there are severe
 shortages of food and medicines. Political prisoners are often not allowed visitors or
 any other direct form of contact with family and friends. The Government operates
 labor camps, but little is known about the conditions of incarceration.
 The Government does not routinely permit prison visits by human rights mon-
 itors, although diplomats have occasionally obtained access in specific cases.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Security forces continued to arrest and
 detain citizens arbitrarily. Uzbekistan continues to use the Soviet legal system, and
 laws on detention have not changed since independence. According to the law, police
 may hold a person suspected of committing a crime for up to 3 days. At the end
 of this period, the suspect must be either officially charged or released. A prosecu-
 tor's order is required for arrests but not for detentions. A court case must be sched-
 uled within 15 days of the arrest, and the defendant may be detained during this
 period. A defendant may not have access to counsel while in detention but only after
 formal arrest. Delays between detention and trials can be lengthy-one Islamic cler-
 ic detained in September 1994 did not go on trial until May 1995.
 In practice police arbitrarily stop and detain individuals, whether dissidents or
 not, without warrant or just cause. In the past, opposition and religious figures have
 been charged with offenses such as drug possession, illegal possession of firearms,
 or disorderly conduct in an effort to stifle their criticism of government policy. In
 June authorities resumed these tactics by convicting Islamic teacher Rahmatjon
 Otaqulov of the illegal possession of narcotics and ammunition. Police rame to
 Otaqulov's home to tell him that his car had been involved in an accident. At the
 supposed accident scene, police "discovered" narcotics on Otaqulov, in the presence
 of two people, who reportedly were detained earlier in order to witness the arrest.
 A subsequent search of Otaqulov's home supposedly uncovered ammunition. At the
 trial in June, the defense lawyer effectively questioned the credibility of the arrest-
 ing officers and witnesses, but Otaqulov ultimately was convicted and sentenced to
 31/2 years' imprisonment. Additionally, a second Islamic teacher, Olimjon Gafurov,
 received a 1 year prison term for the illegal possession of narcotics and arms. Inde-
 pendent observers believe that the incriminating contraband was planted by the ar-
 resting officers.
 
 
 1392
 On December 21, Samarkand police detained Mikhail Ardzinov, Chairman of the
 Independent Human Rights Society of Uzbekistan (IHROU) and Tajik rights activist
 Jamal Mirsaidov reportedly for organizing an illegal meeting. Police reportedly
 abused Ardzinov and held him until December 22. Mirsaidov reportedly was given
 a 15-day Jail sentence, but released on December 24.
 The MVD has yet to announce the results of its internal investigation of the Au-
 gust 1996 incident in which three police officers, possibly intoxicated, detained the
 local HRW/H representative, a British citizen, as he returned from a dinner engage-
 ment. At the district police station, two senior officials intimidated and verbally
 abused him, and accused him without basis of illegally possessing narcotics and fire-
 arms. He was jailed overnight but police never brought charges. The Government
 did not admit fault, but issued a written apology.
 The Government does not use forced exile.
 e. Denial of Fair Public iWal.-Although the Constitution provides for an inde-
 pendent judicial authority, the judicial branch takes its direction from the executive
 branch. Under the Constitution, the President appoints all judges for 10-year terms.
 They may be removed for crimes or failure to fulfill their obligations. Power to re-
 move judges for failure to fulfill their obligations rests with the President, except
 for Supreme Court judges, whose removal must also be confirmed by Parliament.
 There is a three-tier court system: the people's court on the district level, the re-
 gional courts, and the Supreme Court. District court decisions may be appealed to
 the next highest level within 10 days of the ruling. The Criminal Code reduces the
 list of crimes punishable by death to murder, espionage, and treason, eliminating
 the economic crimes punishable by death in the former Soviet code. Officially and
 in recent practice, most court cases are open to the public but may be closed in ex-
 ceptional cases, such as those involving state secrets, rape, or young defendants.
 Uzbekistan still uses the Soviet judicial system, which features trial by a panel
 of three judges: one professional judge and two "people's assessors" who are chosen
 by the workers' collectives for a period of 2  years. The judge presides and directs
 the proceedings. Defendants have the right to attend the proceedings, confront wit-
 nesses, and present evidence. The State provides a lawyer without charge, but by
 law the accused has the right to hire an attorney. In some political cases, the de-
 fendants have not had access to lawyers.
 Detainees deemed not to be violent may be released on their own recognizance
 pending trial. No money need be posted as bond, but in such cases the accused must
 usually sign apledge not to leave the city.
 In practice defense lawyers are unskilled at defending their clients. Courts often
 do not allow all defense witnesses to be heard, and written documents are given
 more weight tha     t       w         In the case of the Namangan 11 (see Sction
 1.d.), the defendants' written confessions, allegedly gained by beatings and repudi-
 ated by the defendants in court, appeared to have been given more weight than the
 testimony of eyewitnesses.
 Human Rights Watch/Helsinki and the Human Rights Society of Uzbekistan
 (HRSU) have compiled lists of 20 to 30 individuals believed to be political prisoners.
 Many were associated with the Biriik or Erkparties, or were involved in independ-
 ent Islamic activities. Many were convicted of nonpolitical offenses such as tax eva-
 sion, misappropriation of funds, or illegal possession of narcotics or firearms. How-
 ever, many observers questioned the fairness of the trials and believe that incrimi-
 nating contraband was planted by arresting officers. Nine individuals believed to be
 political prisoners were released in 1996, but there were no further releases in 1997.
 Citing the threat of Islamic extremism, the Government charged several impris-
 oned political activists and Islamic activists with minor infractions of prison regula-
 tions, keeping them imprisoned by blocking their eligibility for the Government's an-
 nual amnesty. One such prisoner, Abduraub Gafurov, remains imprisoned after
 MVD officials illegally closed his trial in December 1996. Foreign observers at-
 tempted unsuccessfully to observe the trial. At the closed hearing, authorities sen-
 tenced Gafurov to an additional 3 years in prison based on testimony from fellow
 prisoners.
 The Government denies that it holds political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-By law
 search warrants issued by a procurator are required. There is no provision for a ju-
 dicial review of warrants. No legal mechanism exists for authorizing telephone tap-
 ping or monitoring. Security agencies routinely monitor telephone calls, and employ
 surveillance and wiretaps in the cases of persons involved in opposition political ac-
 tivities.
 The Government does not allow general distribution of foreign newspapers (with
 the exception of two or three very conservative Russian papers) and other publica-
 tions. However, limited numbers of foreign periodicals began to appear in
 
 
 1393
 Tashkent's two major hotels, and authorized groups can obtain foreign periodicals
 through subscription. The publication of the local editions of Izvestia and Pravda
 and the sale of their Moscow editions remained suspended throughout 1997. The au-
 thorities black out Russian news broadcasts when they are critical of the Govern-
 ment (see Section 2.a.)
 Opposition activist and former vice president Shukrullo Mirsaidov remained evict-
 ed from his home after the Government reimplemented a long-dormant, politically
 motivated property confiscation order against him (see Section 3).
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-Although the Constitution provides for "freedom
 of thought, speech, and convictions," the Government continues to limit severely
 these rights.
 A 1991 law against "offending the honor and dignity of the President" limits the
 ability to criticize the President. Journalists and ordinary citizens remain afraid to
 express views critical of the President and the Government.
 Information remains very tightly controlled. Although the Constitution prohibits
 censorship, it is widely practiced and the Government tolerates little, if any, criti-
 cism of its actions. Newspapers may not be printed without the censor's approval.
 All newspapers are printed by the same state-owned printing houses, which will not
 print any paper whose editor does not confirm that the issue has been cleared by
 the censor a few hours before being submitted. The Government reportedly provides
 funding and office space for censors. Journalists and writers who want to ensure
 that their work is published practice self-censorship. Several speakers at the 1996
 Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe-sponsored human rights con-
 ference openly challenged the Government's assertion that there is no censorship.
 The editor of the Hurriyat newspaper, an Uzbek-language weekly that had pub.
 lished several issues mildly critical of some aspects of Uzbek television media, re-
 signed due to concern that-his paper might be censored after state television criti-
 cized his role; the journal then published under closer state scrutiny. Vatan, the
 newspaper of the progovernment Fatherland Progress Party, ceased publication
 temporarily after publishing an analytical article about the President's August 1996
 speech to Parliament on human rights, reportedly under pressure from government
 officials displeased by the article.
 In April the Parliament passed a new law providing for freedom of access to infor-
 mation. A second law provides for protection of journalists' professional activity, in-
 cluding protection for journalists' sources, and mandates that government agencies
 respond to written requests for information within 30 days. A mass media law was
 passed in December, however, several articles are worded in such a way that they
 could be used to punish government critics, for example, one provision makes jour-
 nalists responsible for the truth of the information contained in their news stories,
 potentially subjecting journalists to prosecution if a government official disagrees
 with a news report. At year's end, the Government had not yet demonstrated wheth-
 er it was committed to implement such laws in an effective manner so as to provide
 a foundation for major and positive systemic change.
 The Uzbekistan Information Agency cooperates closely with the presidential staff
 to prepare and distribute all officially sanctioned news and information. Nearly all
 newspapers are government owned and controlled; the key papers are organs of gov-
 ernment ministries. State enterprises control the printing presses.
 The last opposition newspaper to be published was that of the Erk party. In 1993
 it was banne and has not been published since.
 Magazines and weeklies have to be registered, a procedure that includes providing
 information about the sources of funding, means of distribution, founders, and spon-
 sors. A resolution by the Cabinet of Ministers bans private persons and journalist
 collectives from founding newspapers or magazines. Foreign correspondents based
 in Tashkent report that the security services have harassed and threatened their
 translators and other local employees. Limited numbers of foreign periodicals are
 available, but the Government does not allow the general distribution of foreign
 newspapers (see Section 1.f.).
 Television broadcasting is state controlled. Although there are local stations in
 various regions, nationwide programming is on two state-run channels that fully
 support the Government and its policies. The Ostankino channel from Russia broad-
 casts during the evening. Its news broadcasts are blacked out when they are critical
 of the Government. A cable television joint venture between the state broadcasting
 company and a U.S. company broadcasts the Hong Kong-based "Star" television
 channels, including the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC), Deutche Welle, and
 Cable News Network world news, to Tashkent and a few other locations.
 
 
 1394
 In September an Urgench-based independent television station resumed broad-
 casting after being closed by local authorities. Despite winning three court appeals,
 which allowed the station to reopn, local authorities used a variety of means to
 keep the station off the air, including sabotaging its signal, barring employees entry
 to  ae stion, and using police to damage epment. The station, managed by a
 former member of the opposition Erk politicalp arty, reportedly broadcasted music,
 news, and programming distributed by Saarand's television station. The Sam-
 arkand Independent Television (STy) station also considers itself independent. It
 claims not to receive any government subsidy and to exist wholly on income derived
 from advertisers. It currently has three channels and plans a fourth, devoted to en-
 tertainment in 1998. It is clearly sensitive to political concerns from the center and
 concentrates on nonpolitical news but claims not to be formally censored. The Sam-
 arkand station received an exclusive license from the Government to distribute tele-
 vision programming to stations in the western part of the country.
 Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, which opened a bureau in Tashkent in May
 1996 staffed by two local Uzbek correspondents, the Voice of America, and BBC
 radio, along with the less widely available cable television channels, are among the
 few sources of uncontrolled news.
 There are no private publishing houses, and government approval is required for
 all publications.
 Virtually all academic institutions are experiencing increased autonomy, but free-
 dom of expression is still limited. Most institutions are in the process of revising
 curriculums, and Western textbooks are in great demand.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 the right of peaceful assembly. However, it also states that the authoritis have the
 right to suspend or ban rallies, meetings, and demonstrations on security grounds.
 The Government must sanction demonstrations and does not routinely grant this
 permission.
 The Constitution provides for the right of freedom of association, but the Govern-
 ment limits the  s      of this right by refusing to register opposition political par-
 ties and movements opposed to the established order. The Constitution places broad
 limitations on the types of ups that may form and requires that all organizations
 be formally registered with the Government in accordance with procedures pre-
 scribed by law. In 1996 the Parliament passed new legislation on political parties
 that increased the number of signatures required to register a political party from
 3,000 to 5,000 and raised the numberof oblasts in which a party must be rep-
 resented to eight. A party must meet other requirements, such as providing an ofi-
 cial address. Independent observers believe that the Government intends to make
 it more difficult to form and register parties. A 1996 analysis by legal observers con-
 cluded that, while the law provides protections for minority parties and permits a
 wide range of fund raising, it also accords the Ministry of Justice brad powers to
 interfere with political parties and withhold fenancial and legal support to parties
 opposed to the Government. The process for registering NGO's and otherpublic as-
 sociations is also difficult and time consuming, with many opportunities or official
 obstruction.
 Since 1992 the Government has repeatedly frustrated the efforts of the HRSU, a
 local human rights group with close ties to exiled opposition figures, to register offi-
 cially. In 1996 the Government granted permission for the HRSU to hold a founding
 organizational meeting (kurultai), a prerequisite for receiving registration, and
 agreed to consider the HRSU's application for registration. In January, April, and
 Augnst, the Government declined to act on the IRSU's application to register, re-
 peatedly citing technical deficiencies in its paperwork. Independent observers be-
 lieve the Government's refusal to register the HRSU is politically motivated. In Au-
 Rst the newly created Independent Human Rights Organization of Uzbekistan
 IOU), headed by longtime human rights activist Mikhail Ardzinov, held its
 founding kurulta and filed registration papers with the Ministry of Justice. The
 meeting was conducted in secret after local authorities illegally refused to respond
 to the IHROU's formal request to hold its founding congress. In December the Mn-
 istry declined to act on the IHROU's application, citing technical deficiencies in the
 aprwork. In 1996 the Government granted registration to another human rights
 N, the Committee for Protection of Individual Rights, a group formed with the
 sup port of the Government.
 In earlier years, the Government repeatedly denied the attempts of the Birlik
 movement and Erk party to register as parties. Most of these organizations' leaders
 have since gone into exile, and these organizations made no attempt to register in
 1997, reportedly because their remaining adherents in the country are afraid of gov-
 ernment reprisals. The Constitution and a 1991 amendment to the law on political
 parties ban those of a religious nature. Authorities cite this principle in denying reg-
 
 
 1395
 istration to religious parties, including the Islamic Renaissance Party (IRP). Other
 opposition activists have announced the formation of the "Adolat-True Path" party
 but never pursued formal registration, claiming that their members are also afraid
 of government reprisals.
 Nonpolitical associations and social organizations usually did not encounter com-
 parable difficulties in registering, although bureaucratic delays and official suspicion
 continued to plague the registration process for such groups. Some evangelical
 churches (see Section 2.c.) and some foreign humanitarian assistance groups found
 it difficult to obtain registration or reregistration.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of religion and for
 the principle of separation of religion and state. However, despite allowing many
 groups to worship freely, for example, the Russian Orthodox and several other
 Christian denominations, the Government suppressessome, religious gups that
 defy the authority of state-appointed religious authorities, particularly Islamic dis-
 sidents. In addition despite the principle of-separation of religion and state, the ov-
 eminent-controlled Spiritual Directorate for Muslims funds some Islamic religious
 activities.
 After the enforced atheism of the Soviet period, religious communities are experi-
 encing a significant revival. Religious education is becoming more-widespread, al-
 though it is not included in state schools. While Islam is the religion of the majority,
 ethnic minorities may also practice their religion in relative freedom.
 However, tensions arise when churches attempt.to convert -across ethnic lines, es-
 pecially when they attempt to convert members of generally Muslim ethnic groups
 to Christianity. lthough distribution of religious literature is legal, missionary ac-
 tivity and proselytizing is not.
 Authorities tolerate, many non-Orthodox Christian evangelical groups, but do not
 register Christian sects that the Government does not a pprove.
 - Evangelical leader Denis Podorozhny, head of the Word of Faith -congregation,
 t -continued to try to regain- the registration his group lost in 1994, despite having
 twice been arrested- in 1996 and spending 12 days in jail. Mission of Mercy head
 Olga Avetisova has tried. for 7 years to register her Christian humanitarian associa-
 .tion despite receiving death threats from local officials in 1996. In October the Gov-
 ernment released a shipment containing 24,960 Bibles confiscated by customs in De-
 cember 1996. There-is evidence that customs officials acted on. orders issued by the
 Committee on Religious Affairs, a department, of the executive office of the presi-
 dent.
 Fearing-the destabilizing influence of-extremist Islamic -forces, the. Government
 has sought to control the Islamic hierarchy, the content of imams' sermons,, and the
 extent -and substance of published Islamic materials. However, Islamic groups- not
 affiliated with the Government form a "parallel Islam.", The Government has de-
 tained a number of Fergana. Valley Islamic clerics on various charges (see- Section
 '1.d.). Bureaucratic restrictions have also inhibited the free operation of numerous re-
 ligious-schools. Dissident Islamic figures deny, that they are extremists and claim
 that they are being persecuted for their unwillingness to praise the Government's
 actions "slavishly."
 Muslim leaders have been detained and harassed for acts of perceived insubor-
 dination'and independence. Shortly before the expiration of his 3-year term in 1996,
 -Uzbek -authorities charged imprisoned Islamic Muslim activist Abduraub Gafurov,
 as well as several- other religious activists with, violations of minor prison regula-
 tions and sentenced him to an additional 2 years. The new conviction made Gafurov
 ineligible for release under the Government's annual parole. In 1996-the govern-
 ment-appointed mufti fired imam Abidkhon Nazarov,; head of the Tukhtoboi mosque
 in Tashkent, and several other independent-minded Islamic clerics. These clerics
 were fired ostensibly for failing-a government-designed "imam test" which included
 - questions about political and economic policy outside, the traditional sphere of a reli-
 gious cleric. The Andijon Friday mosque, where missing imam Abduvali Kori
 Mirzaev (see Section L.b. formerly. preached, was closed by the Government in mid-
 1995 and-remains closed.
 There is no pattern of official discrimination against Jews. Synagogues function
 openly; Hebrew education (long banned under the Soviets), Jewish cultural events,
 and the publication of-a community newspaper take place undisturbed. However,
 the perception of bleak economic prospects; occasional'harassment by low-level offi-
 cials,- which some believe is- anti-Semitic in origin (others say that. such incidents
 occur in the context of harassment that any resident of Uzbekistan ma  ace); and
 the belief that militant Islam  might become a strong force are motivating many
 Jews to emigrate.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within theCountry, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Constitution provides for free movement within the country and
 
 
 1396
 across its borders, and the Government generally respected these rights. The Gov-
 ernment issues new passports in place of the old Soviet ones for citizens traveling
 overseas, but, in. principle, for purely internal travel, the old passports will remain
 valid until 2000. The new passports serve as both internal identity cards and, when
 properly certified, as external passports. In addition the Government has greatly
 simplified the process of obtaining exit visas, which are valid for a period of 2 years
 and no longer require invitations.
 Most barriers to emigration were lifted before the Soviet breakup. Although in
 some instances emigrants are delayed by long waits for passports and exit visas, po-
 tential emigrants who can find a host country willing to accept them are able to
 leave the country. Since independence, a significant number of non-Uzbeks, includ-
 ing Russians, Jews, Ukrainians, and others have emigrated, although no figures are
 available. These people have left because of their perception that economic condi-
 tions are better elsewhere and, in some cases, because of concern that future eco-
 nomic and social prospects for non-Uzbeks are limited. A sizable number of Russian
 emigrants, finding poor economic conditions and discrimination in Russia, have re-
 turned.
 The travel of local citizens is not controlled, unlike travel by foreigners, including
 journalists. Due to treaties between their countries and Uzbekistan, citizens of
 France, Germany, the Republic of Korea, the United Kingdom, and the United
 States receive visas valid or travel throughout the country. Other foreign visitors
 must have each city they wish to visit noted on their visas. Tourists seeking to
 check into hotels without the appropriate internal visa often find themselves having
 to pay fines or bribes to local officials. In mid-1995, a presidential edict decreed that
 the ancient cities of Tashkent, Samarkand, Bukhara, and Khiva would henceforth
 be "open cities," for which a separate visa notation is not required for nationals of
 any country and Uzbek visas now are valid for travel throughout the country with-
 out special annotation. Visitors require special permission, however, to travel to cer-
 tain areas, for example, Termez on the Afghan border.
 On occasion the Government created problems for human rights activists who
 sought to enter or leave the country. Both Abdoumannob Pulat and Mikhail
 Ardzinov experienced such difficulties (see Sections 3 and 4).
 The law on citizenship stipulates that citizens do not lose their citizenship if they
 reside overseas. However, since Uzbekistan does not provide for dual citizenship,
 those acquiring other citizenship lose Uzbek citizenship. If they return to
 'Uzbekistan as foreign citizens, they are subject to foreign visa regulations. There
 is no evidence that anyone was denied permission to return.
 There is no law concerning the rights of refugees and asylum seekers, and the
 Government does not recognize the right of first asylum. The Government considers
 asylum seekers from Tajikistan and Afghanistan to be economic migrants, and such
 individuals are subject to harassment and bribe attempts when seeking to regular-
 ize their status. They may be deported if their residency documents are not in order.
 The country hosts populations of ethnic Koreans, Meskhetian Turks, and Crimean
 Tartars deported to Central Asia by Stalin during World War II. These groups enjoy
 the same rights as other citizens. Although they are free to return to their ancestral
 homelands, absorption problems in those countries have slowed that return. The
 United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) estimates that there are
 30,000 Tajik and 9,000 Afghan asylum seekers of whom 2,000 have filed asylum re-
 quests with the UNHCR and 960 have received mandate refugee status, figures
 which have not changed significantly since 1995. There were two confirmed reports
 of forced repatriation of two Afghan refugees in October.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 While the Constitution provides for this right, in reality citizens cannot exercise
 their right to change their government through peaceful and democratic means. The
 Government severely represses opposition groups and individuals and applies strict
 limits on freedom of expression. No true opposition groups participated in govern-
 ment or were allowed to function legally.
 Uzbekistan is ruled by a highly centralized presidency, comprising the President,
 a small inner circle of advisers, and senior government officials. President Karimov,
 formerly the first secretary of the Communist party in Uzbekistan under Soviet
 rule, was elected in a limited multicandidate election in 1991. A 1995 Soviet-style
 referendum and subsequent parliamentary decision extended Karimov's term until
 the year 2000. President Karimov and the executive branch retain control through
 sweeping decree powers, primary authority for drafting legislation, and control of
 virtually all government appointments, most aspects of the economy, and the secu-
 rity forces.
 
 
 1397
 Most government officials are members of the People's Democratic Party of
 Uzbekistan (PDP),-formerly the Communist party and still the country's largest
 party. However the party as such does not appear to play a significant role in gov-
 ernment, and the President resigned his chairmanship of the party in 1996.
 . The 1995 parliamentary elections were limited to-candidates and parties (the PDP
 and one other government-sponsored party) that support the President. Since then,
 ,several other government-sponsored parties have been created and entered Par-
 liament through unchallenged by-elections and other arrangements. The Oliy Majlis
 is constitutionally-the highest government body. In practice despite assistance ef-
 forts by international donors to upgrade its ability to draft laws independently, its
 main purpose is to confirm laws and other decisions drafted by the executive branch
 rather than to initiate legislation.
 Few people were willing to challenge the Government's grip on power or even risk
 criticizing it publiclyMost opposition-and human rights activists in exile have ex-
 pressed their mistrust of' President Karimov's 1996 offer to return to Uzbekistan.
 Human rights activist Abdoumannob Pulat sought without-success to obtain a re-
 turn visa to assist with the registration of the'HRSU. In June the Government ini-
 tially refused to grant a return visa to Pulat to visit his dying mother, although it
 subsequently relented and granted the visa. Pulat, head of the HRSU (see Section
 4) and brother of exiled Birlik leader Abdurakhin Poulatov, moved freely within the
 country and was not-harassed, after he promised not -to engage in political activity
 during his visit.
 Opposition activist and former vice president Shukrullo Mirsaidov remained evict-
 ed from his home after.the Governmentreimplemented a long-dormant, politically-
 motivated property confiscation order against him based on his earlier, politically-
 motivated conviction for corruption while in office: His family was also harassed, ap-
 parently in retaliation for Mirsaidov's remarks at a 1996" OSCE-sponsored seminar
 on human rights. Police placed the-family.under, surveillance and questioned neigh-
 bors after Mirsaidov spoke at.the conference. During the trial leading to his eviction
 and relocation in a government-provided apartment, the district representative
 withdrew the action on grounds of insufficient evidence, but the prosecutor and
 judge refused to halt the trial. In 1996 Mirsaidov's son, Hasan, was abducted by sev-
 eral unidentified men: under circumstances suggesting official involvement. Hasan
 was handcuffed, beaten, and threatened with execution, only to be released after 12
 hours. No ransom demand was made on the family. The culprits have still not been
 identified.
 The Government does not officially forbid membership in any political organiza-
 tion. However, individuals whose names are linked with unregistered, opposition-
 linked organizations report that they are subject to telephonic and written harass-
 ment and discrimination in the workplace. Secular political dissidents report that
 harassment and surveillance have decreased over the past year. Small groups have
 begun to meet to discuss politics, but practice self-censorship to avoid triggering a
 government response to their activities. Harassment and surveillance of Islamic dis-
 sidents continue.
 Traditionally, women participate much less than men in government and politics.
 Only 13 of the 250 deputies in Parliament are female. In 1995 the President pro-
 moted the chairwoman of the governmental Women's Committee of Uzbekistan to
 the position of Deputy Prime Minister. Her duties specifically include monitoring
 the rights and welfare of women.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The Government generally disapproves of local nongovernmental organizations
 working on human rights, and restricts their operations. Local NGO's face many ob-
 stacles. Laws left over from the Soviet period present difficulties in registration and
 operation for NGO's and private business alike.
 The Human Rights Society of Uzbekistan (HRSU), an opposition-linked group
 formed in 1992, has been the chief independent source on human rights abuses in
 Uzbekistan. The Government has declined to register the HRSU, repeatedly finding
 deficiencies in its applications, and HRSU activists have been subject to prolonged
 harassment, including physical violence. The Government permitted the HRSU to
 take the first step in the registration process, the holding of a founding congress,
 or "kurultai," in 1996. In January, April, and August, the authorities declined to act
 on the HRSU's registration petition, asserting that there were technical difficulties
 in its paperwork. HRSU activists continued to suffer harassment, although less than
 in previous years. The HRSU publishes reports in Moscow and circulates materials
 in Uzbekistan, but has no formal right to publish materials locally.
 
 
 1398
 Government officials initially refused to grant a return visa to HRSU chairman
 Pulat, but when he asked specifically to visit his dying mother, the authorities sub-
 sequently relented (see Section 3). He remained in Uzbekistan for several weeks
 without incident.
 The Independent Human Rights Organization of Uzbekistan (IHROU), headed by
 Mikhail Ardzinov, held its founding kurultai in August. The gathering took place
 in secret and without official government sanction because local authorities illegally
 refused to respond to IHROU's official request to conduct its meeting.
 The IHROU reportedly contains 108 members, some of them leading members of
 the human rights community. In May MVD officials confiscated the passport of
 IHROU head Mikhail Ardzinov and refused to issue his exit visa. Officials later
 reed to return the passport, but after initially refusing to issue a visa did so in
 Noebr.
 In April the Parliament passed legislation establishing an "authorized person"
 (ombudsman) to conduct investigations into violations of human rights. The ombuds-
 man may make recommendations to modif or u hold decisions of state agencies,
 but the recommendations are not binding. The ombudman is prohibited from inves-
 tigating disputes within the purview of courts. The ombudsman replaces the par-
 liamentary human rights commissioner, who had insufficient trained staff to carry
 out in-depth investigations of human rights violations and did not vigorously pursue
 allegations against the police and security forces. At year's end, an individual with
 an approximately 12-person staff was functioning. Reportedly, the new ombudsman
 had reviewed hundreds of cases, but citizens frequently stated that their claims are
 not answered, and observers are aware of few cases satisfactorily resolved by the
 ombudsman.
 After years of opposition and delay, the Government registered one human rights
 NGO in 1996. The registered NGO, the Committee for Protection of Human Rights,
 was formed with the support of the Government, but has ties to opposition figures
 as well. It reportedly has had some success in investigating abuses and getting the
 Government to correct them. Some sources affiliated with other groups have ques-
 tioned its true degree of independence from the Government. Human Rights Watch/
 Helsinki, which opened a Tashkent office in 1996, now monitors human rights de-
 velopments from outside Uzbekistan following the expiration of the contract of its
 local representative. At year's end, no replacement had been named.
 In the past, the Government sharply criticized international human rights groups
 and Western and Russian reporters for what it considered biased reporting on
 human rights in the country. The Government has continued to reject criticism from
 Moscow-based sources, but in 1996 announced its willingness to hold an open dialog
 with international human rights NGO's. At year's end, the Government had not
 taken any action in this area. In October the Government and OSCE/ODIHR con-
 ducted a roundtable supposedly to develop cooperation between domestic human
 rights institutions, the media, and NGO's. The HSRU and other NGO's participated,
 but no meaningful dialog developed.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 Both the Constitution and the 1992 law on citizenship prohibit discrimination on
 the basis of sex, religion, language, or social status; however, societal discrimination
 against women persists.
 Women.-Spousal abuse is common, but local activists have no statistics. Wife
 beating is considered a personal family affair rather than a criminal act, and thus
 such cases are usually handled by family members or elders within the community
 (mahalla) and rarely come to court.
 Due to tradition, women, particularly in rural areas, usually marry before age 20,
 bear many children, and confine their activities within the family. In rural areas,
 women often find themselves limited to arduous labor in the cotton fields. However,
 women are not formally impeded from seeking a role in the workplace: the barriers
 to equality for women are cultural, not legal, and women who open businesses or
 seek careers are not legally hindered.
 Although discrimination against women is prohibited by law, traditional cultural
 and religious practices severely limit their role in everyday society. For these rea-
 sons, women are severely underrepresented in high-level positions. In 1995 Presi-
 dent Karimov issued a decree on measures to increase the role of women in society,
 particularly extending their participation in state and social administration and co-
 ordinating the activities of ministries and social organizations as they relate to
 women's issues. In this connection, a new post, deputy Prime Minister, was estab-
 lished with responsibilities for the management of matters connected with further-
 ing the role of women in society. The edict also created heads of women's affairs
 
 
 1399
 in the autonomous republic of Karakalpakstan, regions, cities, and districts. The
 Ministry of Finance was ordered to allocate the necessary funds to finance these
 new positions and working bodies. Government-controlled women's committees were
 formed in most region, but most are underfunded and play only a minor role in
 improving the condition of women.
 Several dozen NGO's address the needs of women. The Business Women's Asso-
 ciation, in addition to providing resources and information about developing small
 enterprises, operates a store which sells clothing and crafts. A center in Tashkent
 conducts seminars on sexual harassment, domestic violence, and the legal rights of
 women. Another center in Samarkand operates a crisis hotline and provides edu-
 cational services on alcoholism, sexually transmitted diseases, and family counsel-
 inj Uzebek women's NGO reports that self-burning by women and girls, or self-im-
 molation, is not uncommon. The NGO reports that there are no reliable statistics
 because women and girls refuse to discuss the issue outside of their families or
 mahallas. Victims usually suffer from depression due, in part, to their low social
 status. After marriage, many women or girls move into the husband's home, where
 they ocpy the lowest rung on the social ladder in their new families. Burning, or
 self-immolation, often occurs as the result of a conflict with the husband or mother-
 in-law, who by tradition exercises complete control over the young bride.
 A research study indicates that the number of women enrolling in higher edu-
 cation is diminishing, for example, women's enrollment in the Finance and Banking
 Institute dropped from 65 percent in 1991 to about 25 percent this year. Cutbacks
 in governmint funding to universities and the need for families to fund a higher
 percentage of educational costs leaves many families in the position of being able
 to fund the education of only one child, either a son or a daughter. The report states
 that university faculty "steer" women into occupations traditionally performed by fe-
 males and suggests that administrators may practice a deliberate policy of baring
 entrance to women in some fields.
 Children.-The Constitution provides for children's rights, stating that parents
 are obliged to support and care for their children until they are of age. In theory
 the State provides free universal primary education and health care. In practice
 shortages and budget difficulties mean that some services must be paid privately.
 The State grants monetary allowances to families based on their number of chil-
 dren. Uzbekistan has a very high birthrate; over one-half of the population is under
 the age of 15.
 There is no societal pattern of abuse of children.
 People With Disabilities.-One of the country's first laws, adopted only 2 months
 after independence in 1991,provided support for the disabled. This law was aimed
 at ensuring that the disabled have the same rights as other citizens. However, little
 effort is made to bring the disabled into the mainstream. The State cares for the
 mentally retarded in special homes. The Government has not mandated access to
 public places for the disabled.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.--Government statistics show that the popu-
 lation of approximately 23 million is about 71 percent Uzbeks, 8 percent Russians,
 5 percent Tajiks, 4 percent Tatars, and 3 percent Kazakhs, with many other ethnic
 groups represented.
 The citizenship law, passed in 1992, does not impose language requirements for
 citizenship. Nonetheless, the language issue remains very sensitive. Uzbek has been
 declared the state language, and the Constitution requires that the President speak
 Uzbek. However, the language law provides for Russian as "the language of inter-
 ethnic communication." Russian is widely spoken in the main cities, and Tajik is
 widely spoken in Samarkand and Bukhara. The language law, passed in 1989, origi-
 nally required that Uzbek would be the sole method of official communication by
 1998, but subsequently was modified and now stipulates no specific date.
 Uzbekistan also is in the process of replacing its Cyrillic alphabet with the Latin
 alphabet. However, realizing the difficulties for Uzbeks and minorities alike, the
 Government has delayed the full transition to both Uzbek and the Latin alphabet
 to 2005.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The 1992 law on unions specifically provides that
 all workers have the right voluntarily to form and join unions of their choice, and
 that trade unions themselves may voluntarily associate territorially or sectorally.
 Membership in trade unions is optional. The law also declares all unions independ-
 ent of the State's administrative and economic bodies (except where provided or by
 law), and states that trade unions should develop their own charters, structure, and
 executive bodies and organize their own work.
 
 
 1400
 
 In practice, however, the overall structure of trade unions has not changed signifi-
 cantly since the Soviet era. Independence has eliminated subordination to the Soviet
 Union or Russia but has not altered the centralized trade union hierarchy, which
 r-remains dependent on the Government. No "alternative" central union structures
 exist. A few new professional associations and interest groups have been organized,
 -such as a union of entrepreneurs, a union of renters, an association of private physi-
 . cians .and-pharmacists, -and one of lawyers. Their role, degree of independence from
 the. Government, and strength are as yet uncertain. Some of these groups hope to
 - play a significant role in licensing, and otherwise regulating the economic activity
 of their members.
 - According to the law,, the Council of the Federation. Df Trade Unions (CFTU) has
 a.consultative-voice i-the preparation of all legislation -affecting workers- and is en-
 titled to draft laws. on labor and, social issues. Trade, unions are legally described
 as- organizations that defend-the right to work and protect jobs. They have lost their
 previous role in state planning and in the management of enterprises. The emphasis
 - now is on the unions' responsibility for "social protection" and social justice-espe-
 cially -unemployment compensation, pensions, and worker retraining.
 The trade union law does not mention strikes or cite a right to strike. However,
 the law.does give the unions oversight for both-individual and collective labor dis-
 -putes; which are defined as those involving alleged violations of labor laws, worker
 -ights,-or collective.agreements.
 "rherewere few. reports of strikes. It likely reflects the absence'of truly represent-
 ative trade unions as the standard of living fell and growing unemployment raised
 socialtensions. However, both union and government officials assert that the lack
 of -strikes reflects general support for the Government's policies and common inter-
 est in social stability.
 .. The 1992 law on unians provides that -unions may choose their own international
 affiliations.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectiuely.-Trade unions. may conclude
 agreements with enterprises. Privatization is -still in its very early phase. As a re-
 'sult, there is no experience with negotiations �that could be described  a dversarial
 between unions -and private employers. .With few exceptions, the State is still the
 major employer, and the state-appointed union- leaders do not view themselves as
 having conflicts of interest with the State.
 The-. Ministry of Labor and the Ministry of Finance in consultation with the
 CFTU, set -the wages for various categories of state employees. In the small private
 sector, management establishes wages or negotiates them with those who contract
 ,for employment.
 The law forbids discrimination against union members and their officers, and no
 complaints were registered.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Constitution specifically pro-
 hibits forced labor, except  as legal punishment or as may be specified by law. The
 law does not specifically prohibit forced and bonded labor by children, but such prac-
 tices are- not known to occur. However, large-scale compulsory mobilization ofyouth
 and students (by closing schools) to help with the cotton harvest continues. Young
 people in rural areas are expected to participate "voluntarily" in harvesting activi-
 ties of all kinds, and universities still shut down temporarily to send both students
 and faculty into the fields. In many parts of the country, students are forced to take
 up to a month from their studies to pick cotton in unpleasant conditions. Student
 labor is poorly paid and students must- sometimes pay for their own food. Adults,
 including teachers andpassersby in automobiles and busses, are similarly forced
 into the harvest effort.
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment.-Govern-
 ment law does not specifically prohibit forced and bonded labor by children, but
 such practices are not known to occur (see Section 6.c.).
 The minimum working age is 16 years; 15-year-olds can work with permission but
 have a shorter workday. In rural areas, younger children and the elderly often turn
 out to help harvest cotton and other crops. The Labor Ministry has an inspection
 service responsible for enforcing compliance with these and other regulations gov-
 _erning employment conditions and enforres them effectively.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The Ministry of Labor, in consultation with the
 CFTU, sets the minimum wage. As- of September 1, it was about $10.00 (750 som)
 per month. The minimum wage is not sufficient to provide a decent living for a
 worker and family. The workweek is set at 41 hours per week and includes a 24-
 hour rest period. Some factories have apparently reduced work hours in order to
 avoid layoffs. Overtime pay exists in-theory but is not always paid.

 The Labor Ministry establishes occupational health and safety standards in con-
 sultation with the unions. There is a health and safety inspectorate in the Ministry.
 Workers do leave jobs that are hazardous without apparent jeopardy to continued
 employment; but in practice high rates of underemployment make this step difficult.
 The local press occasionally published complaints about the failure of unions and
 government authorities to do enough to promote worker safety. Although written
 regulations may provide adequate safeguards, workers in hazardous jobs often lack
 protective clothing and equipment.
