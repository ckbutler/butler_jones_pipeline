 BRUNEI
 Brunei is a small, wealthy monarchy located on the north coast
 of Borneo. Although the population of roughly 250,000 is
 predominantly Malay, there are substantial Chinese and other
 minorities. Brunei is a hereditary and traditional sultanate
 that has been ruled by the same family for over 500 years. It
 became a British Protectorate in 1888 and achieved internal
 self-government in 1959. It became independent in 1984.
 The 1959 Constitution provided for the first delegation of
 political power by the Sultan to a Legislative Council and a
 Council of Ministers, but it permitted the Sultan to override
 the decisions of legislative and executive bodies in most
 instances. In 1962 tensions over policy differences with the
 Sultan led to an armed uprising that was put down by British
 troops. After suspending some provisions oF the Constitution
 and repealing others authorizing the election of members of the
 Legislative Council, the Sultan invoked an article of the
 Constitution that allowed him to assume emergency powers for 2
 years. These have been renewed 14 times and remain in force.
 Although not all of the articles of the Constitution are
 suspended, the state of emergency places few limits on the
 Sultan's power. He also serves as Prime Minister.
 The police force, which has responsibility for internal
 security, reports to the Prime Minister's office and is firmly
 under the control of civil authorities.
 Brunei produces about 150,000 barrels of oil per day and
 slightly over 5 million tons of liquefied natural gas per
 year. This combination gives Bruneians one of the world's
 highest per capita gross national products.
 Bruneians do not engage in activities to exercise the freedoms
 of speech press and association contained in the Constitution.
 The right of citizens to change their government does not
 exist. Mandatory flogging of prisoners for a host of offenses,
 discrimination against women, and repression of religious
 freedom are additional problems. The Government increased its
 efforts in 1991 to strengthen observance of traditional
 Bruneian and Muslim values by emphasizing a sociopolitical
 ordering of society known as "Malay Muslim Monarchy." The
 resulting increased Islamization of Bruneian society placed
 significant constraints on the religious freedom of non-Muslims
 provided for in the 1959 Constitution.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from;
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 There were no reports of politically motivated killings.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reports of disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 In 1988 whipping became mandatory punishment for 42 criminal,
 and-drug-related. crimes and vandalism. Since then, sentences
 of whipping occasionally have been handed down and carried out
 
 
 781
 BRUNEI
 in the presence of a doctor who monitors the condition of the
 prisoner and has the authority to interrupt and postpone the
 punishment for medical reasons. Hong Kong provides judges for
 Brunei's High Court and Court of Appeal under a Treaty of
 Friendship between Brunei and the United Kingdom. A small
 group of Hong Kong judges requested that they not be considered
 for duty on the Brunei High Court and Court of -Appeal because
 the mandatory nature of whipping as punishment for some
 offenses denied them discretion in cases in which they might
 believe extenuating circumstances existed.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The Constitution has no provision for habeas corpus. While
 legislative provisions granting the right of habeas corpus
 .exist, those provisions, like the Constitution itself, can be
 superseded, either partially or wholly, through invocation of
 the emergency powers, which remain in effect. Under normal
 circumstances, a magistrate must "endorse" a warrant for
 arrest. On rare occasions, warrants are issued without this
 ,endorsement.
 The Internal Security Act (ISA) permits the Government to
 detain suspects without trial for renewable 2-year periods.
 Since the abortive rebellion in 1962, the Government has
 occasionally used the ISA to detain persons suspected of
 antigovernment activity.
 While political detentions were not uncommon in previous years,
 the last detainees were released in 1990. At the end of the
 year, there were no known political detainees remaining. None
 of the detainees was ever charged with any crime.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The Bruneian judicial system consists of five levels of courts:
 magistrate, intermediate, high, and appellate, with final
 recourse available through the Privy Council in London.
 Although there is no trial by jury, procedural safeguards,
 including the right to defense counsel, the right to an
 interpreter, the right to a speedy trial, and the right to
 confront accusers, are available. Because Brunei has no senior
 judiciary of its own, the Chief Justice of the Brunei High
 Court is a judge seconded from Hong Kong. There were no known
 instances of interference with the judiciary by the Government
 in 1991 and no trials of political opponents.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Although the Government is empowered by law to intrude into the
 privacy of individual persons, families, or homes, it has not
 been known to do so, except in drug cases.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Freedom of speech and freedom of the press are not restricted
 by law, but there is no organized political opposition in
 Brunei. The independently owned newspaper avoids controversial
 issues; and the only television station is governmentowned (the
 broadcasts of two Malaysian television stations can also be
 received). Because of the almost total absence of criticism or
 opposing views, the Government's tolerance of political
 
 
 782
 BRUNEI
 criticism has not been effectively tested recently. In the
 past it has not hesitated to arrest those who attempted to
 espouse unwelcome political views.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Freedom to assemble for political purposes also has not been
 seriously tested in recent years. In 1985 the Government
 allowed establishment of the Brunei National Democratic Party
 (BNDP), the first political party to be formed since party
 activity was prohibited in 1967. Just before its first public
 meeting, the Government announced that government employees
 could not attend party meetings, become members of political
 parties, or otherwise-engage in organized political debate.
 Since the Government employs over half the labor force, these
 restrictions severely inhibit the recruiting efforts of any
 political partyy. In February 1988, the Government dissolved
 the BNDP- and detained two of its leaders, charging that the
 party's contacts with the International-Democratic Union were
 in violation of the Societies Act. While one of the two BNDP
 leaders released from detention in March 1990 died shortly
 thereafter (from natural causes), the other remains banned.
 In 1986 the Government approved the establishment of a second
 political party, the Brunei National Solidarity Party (BNSP),
 which continues to function, albeit at a very limited level
 with only a few dozen active members. The Government requires
 the registration of private economic, recreational, religious
 or other organizations.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Islam is the state religion of Brunei, and the Sultan serves as
 the country's chief religious leader. Section III of the 1959
 Constitution provides for freedom of religion for Muslims and
 non-Muslims alike.
 In 1991 the Government began to emphasize the legitimacy of the
 hereditary monarchy and the observance of traditional Bruneian
 and Muslim values by developing and promulgating a
 sociopolitical ordering of society described as "Malay Muslim
 Monarchy." The resulting Islamization of Bruneian society has
 increasingly infringed upon the constitutional rights of
 non-Muslims to worship freely.
 Both Anglican and Roman Catholic communities have experienced
 great difficulty in obtaining government permission to retain
 or replace expatriate clergy, despite repeated requedts.
 Currently, only one Roman Catholic priest is available to
 minister to three Catholic congregations totaling some 15,000
 persons. Members of the Anglican community have experienced
 similar difficulties and for a period of almost 1.year were
 without an ordained priest. In addition, despite a
 constitutional right of freedom of worship, non-Muslims are
 prohibited from proselytizing, except in their own homes and
 among non-Muslims.
 During 1991 the Government closed most Buddhist temples and
 shrines in the country on the grounds that they were not
 registered as such with the Government. Buddhist leaders
 respond that the reason for the many nonregistered temples and
 shrines is the Government's refusal to acknowledge applications
 for building permits for new temples and shrines.

 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 While the movement of certain released former political
 prisoners is restricted, there are no restrictions on freedom
 of movement in the country for most citizens, permanent
 residents, and expatriates. The Government places some
 contractual restrictions on foreign travel for certain of its
 expatriate employees. Travel to Communist nations is
 restricted, and travel to China by Brunei's ethnic Chinese
 citizens and ethnic Chinese residents is tightly controlled.
 Brunei has not been willing to accept asylum seekers, has not
 agreed to the Comprehensive Plan of Action (CPA) adopted by the
 1989 International Conference on Indochinese Refugees, and in
 1989 pushed off at least one boatload of Vietnamese after
 refueling and reprovisioning the boat. According to Brunejan
 immigration officials, there were no pushoffs in 1991;
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of .Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Bruneian citizens are unable to change their government through
 established democratic processes. Under the continuing state
 of emergency, there are no representative bodies at the
 national or local level and, since the dissolution of the BNDP
 in 1988, only the BNSP continues to function in spite of
 government-imposed impediments. Citizens .may seek to influence
 the Government by working through appointed village headmen and
 district officers, who meet regularly with their constituents.
 They may also attempt to effect change by petitioning the
 Sultan directly.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding *International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 There are no government or private organizations in Brunei that
 deal specifically with the protection of human rights. Amnesty
 International (AI) reports that on several occasions it
 appealed to the Sultan for the release of a number of political
 prisoners, who at the time were being held by the Government,
 some for many years without trial, but received no reply. In
 1988 the GoVernment appeared before the U.N. Human Rights
 Commission to answer AI allegations of human rights violations
 relating to ISA detentions. The Government acknowledged the
 detentions but defended them on the grounds of national
 security. As noted in Section l.d., the Government released
 all known detainees in 1990.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Women are denied equal status with men in a number of important
 areas such as divorce, inheritance, and custody of children.
 Men are eligible for permanent positions in government service
 whether or not they hold university degrees; women are eligible
 to hold government positions only on an impermanent,
 month-to-month basis unless they are university graduates.
 Women in month-to-month positions do not qualify for government
 pensions, receive fewer allowances, and get less annual leave
 than their male counterparts in permanent positions. While
 there are no separate pay scales for women and men, women in
 the work force traditionally have been concentrated in lower
 paying clerical and secretarial jobs and have been less likely,
 to.find positions offering rapid advancement. In recent
 
 
 784
 BRUNEI
 years, however, employment opportunities for women have greatly
 improved, largely due to a chronic labor shortage. A growing
 number of women hold senior-level professional positions, and
 the number of female university graduates is also increasing.
 Religious authorities strongly encourage Brunei Muslim women to
 wear the tudong, a traditional head covering, and a growing
 number do so. There is no pressure on non-Muslim women to wear
 the tudong, and few, if any, choose to wear it.
 The incidence of domestic violence against women is extremely
 low. Rape cases are similarly rare. Because of the close-knit
 nature of Bruneian society, such behavior would be difficult if
 not impossible to conceal and would not be tolerated. The
 criminal penalty for a minor domestic assault is 1 to 2 weeks
 in jiil and a fine. An assault resulting in serious injury,
 such as broken bones, would be punished by whipping and a
 longer jail sentence.
 Few of the substantial Chinese minority are citizens; those
 having no claims to other nationalities were "British-protected
 persons" prior to independence and are now either stateless
 permanent or temporary residents. Even permanent residents may
 not own land, but they are permitted to hold property through
 7-year leases, the maximum term for lease agreements in
 Brunei. The process of obtaining citizenship in Brunei is long
 and difficult. Many aspirants complain that the Malay language
 test, which one must pass to obtain citizenship, is
 administered so rigorously that it is virtually impossible for
 a non.native speaker to pass. In general, however, the Chinese
 community has prospered in Brunei, and much of the country's
 commercial activity is conducted by Chinese. While the Chinese
 have done well economically, many are now reevaluating their
 position in Brunei, especially theoprospects of their children
 in a society in which ethnic Malay citizens are favored in such
 areas as government employment. Some Chinese are emigrating.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Trade unions are legal in Brunei but must be registered with
 the Government. Signatures of seven members are required for
 registration. There are four registered trade unions, all of
 them in the oil sector, with a total membership amounting to
 less than 5 percent of the work force. All workers, including
 civil servants other than those serving in the military and
 police, are able to form or join trade unions. Unions are
 independent of the.Government. The Trade Unions Act of 1962
 permits the formation of trade union federations in Brunei but
 forbids affiliation of Brunei trade unions with labor
 organizations outside Brunei. An individual contract is
 required between an employer and each employee, but legal trade
 union activities cannot be deemed to violate employee
 contracts. -Local legal experts interpret this provision as
 conferring the right to strike, but there have been none.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 The Government has not prevented the legal registration of
 trade unions, nor has it dissolved any. There is no government
 interference with lawful union activity. It is illegal to
 refuse employment or discriminate against an employee on the
 basis of membership or nonmembership in a trade union. While
 unions are legal and easy to register, conditions in Brunei are
 not conducive to the development of trade unions; there is
 
 
 785
 BRUNEI
 little interest on the part of workers in forming trade unions;
 and existing unions are inactive. Brunei law is silent on
 collective bargaining, which occurs in only a few industries.
 Wage and benefit packages far exceed those of neighboring
 nations; there is a lack of those kinds of industries in which
 unions have traditionally developed; and there is a long
 cultural tradition favoring consensus over confrontation. Wage
 and benefit packages are arrived at through direct negotiations
 between employer and employee, usually based on a standard
 contract in use by the employer.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. 'Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Forced labor is prohibited and not practiced.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 Employment of children below the age of 16 is prohibited and
 below the age of 18 requires parental consent and approval by
 the Labor Commission. Women under 18 may not work at night or
 on offshore oil platforms. Laws on the employment of children
 are effectively enforced by the Labor Department, which is a
 part of the Ministry of Home Affairs.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 Labor is in short supply, and market forces enable most
 citizens of Brunei to command high wages. Brunei has a
 government-established minimum wage which is more than adequate
 to provide a worker and his family with a decent standard of
 living. Overtime is paid for work in excess of 48 hours, and
 double time is paid for work performed on legal holidays.
 Occupational health and safety standards are established by
 government regulation. Working conditions are subject to
 inspection on a routine basis and in response to complaints by
 Department of Labour (DOL) officials, working under the
 supervision of the Commissioner of Labor (who heads the DOL).
 Labor regulations are generally effectively enforced by the
 DOL, however, at the lower range of the labor sector
 enforcement is lax, especially for foreign laborers. The Labor
 Department is empowered to close any workplace where health,
 safety, or working conditions are unsatisfactory.
