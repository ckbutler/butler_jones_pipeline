 COLOMBIA
 Colombia is a democracy which has been governed by
 freely elected governments for all but five years
 of the present century. The Constitution of 1886,
 as amended, guarantees a wide range of civil and
 political liberties. A constitutionally authorized
 state of siege, which curtails civil and political
 liberties, is currently in effect and has been imposed
 off and on during the last thirty years.
 Two political parties, Liberal and Conservative,
 have dominated politics since 1850. From 1958 to
 1974, under the "National Front" arrangement, the two
 parties alternated political power. The present chief
 executive, Julio Cesar Turbay, is a Liberal, as was
 his predecessor. Third parties have played only
 a minor role in recent years, except in the election
 of 1970, when the candidate of the National Popular
 Alliance nearly won the presidency. Colombia's
 military forces are among the least active politically
 in Latin America.
 There is a serious internal security problem. Some
 2,000 guerrillas are in the countryside, and street
 crime, burglary, kidnapping and urban terrorism have
 reached epidemic proportions.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 There are occasional, credible reports of torture or
 maltreatment of prisoners by the military and police.
 However, the Government does not condone such practices.
 Incidents involving the police are investigated by the
 Office of the Attorney General (Procurador General),
 who is elected by the Congress and is independent of
 both the Executive and Legislative Branches. Depending
 upon the findings of the investigation, the accused may
 be dismissed and/or tried on common criminal charges
 In some cases internal police investigations have
 (225)
 
 
 226
 resulted in the summary dismissal of accused officers.
 Charges against military personnel are normally handled
 through military-judicial, investigative systems.
 Statistics are not available to the Department of State
 on the number of such charges or the results of the
 investigations.
 During late October 1978 some 34 university students
 were detained and accused of association with a
 leftist terrorist group. They denounced the military's
 intelligence service for ill-treating and torturing
 them during their interrogation. President Turbay
 requested the Attorney-General's office to investi-
 gate the charges. The Attorney General named an
 investigating commission. On November 6, the Commission
 reported that medical examinations of the 34 students
 showed signs that they had, indeed, been subjected to
 torture and mistreatment. On November 7, the Attorney
 General sent the results of the Commission's investi-
 gation to the military with instructions to identify
 and prosecute those guilty of torture and to correct
 administrative deficiencies that had permitted the mis-
 treatment.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 There have been few reports of cruel, inhuman or
 degrading treatment or punishment. These charges are
 investigated (see a. above) and appropriate judicial
 action is taken.
 c. Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 Colombian citizens are generally free from arbitrary
 arrest or imprisonment. Under a state of siege the
 government has broad powers to arrest and detain persons
 to preserve public order. The state of siege which is
 currently in effect has been used on and off during the
 last thirty years.
 A security decree, promulgated on September 6, 1978,
 permits local officials, e.g., governors and mayors, to
 impose curfews, ban demonstrations, and regulate the sale
 and consumption of alcoholic beverages. They can also
 forbid parades and demonstrations. It is too early
 
 
 to determine the effect of this new decree, declared
 constitutional by the Supreme Court on October 30,
 1978. Between two and three hundred members of
 Marxist-oriented terrorist groups have been detained
 in operations relying in part on provisions of the
 decree. About half have been released after question-
 ing by the authorities. Criminal charges have been or
 are expected to be placed against most of the remainder.
 d. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The right to fair public trial is observed in most
 cases. However, under the state of siege, those
 accused of certain crimes may be held in jail for up
 to ninety days without trial. Owing to the inefficient
 operation of the overburdened judicial system, many
 never come before a tribunal; they are simply released
 after extended periods. The Government is attempting
 to alleviate the backlog of cases with extra judges
 and is engaged in a program of judicial reforms. In
 addition, the judiciary is actively seeking ways to
 revamp the weak, legalistic, bureaucratic, and fairly
 unresponsive court system. There is currently a Judicial
 Reform Law under consideration by the Colombian Congress.
 Offenses involving security, kidnapping and crimes
 against the military are tried in closed military
 courts where the defendants have the right to counsel.
 e. Invasion of the Home
 Freedom from arbitrary intrusion into the home is
 generally respected. The Constitution requires a legal
 order before the authorities can enter a private home,
 except in case of hot pursuit of a person seen in
 the act of committing a crime who attempts to seek
 refuge in his own home.
 2. Governmental Policies Relating to the Fulfillment
 of Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care
 and Education
 The Government's economic policies stress the need to
 strengthen the country's economic infrastructure, to
 prepare it for rapid industrial and agricultural growth.
 At the same time, the Government tries to implement
 social projects aimed at improving the living standards
 
 
 228
 of the poorest fifty percent of the population. 1975
 data reveals that the poorest forty percent of the house-
 holds acquired only 9.9 percent of the national income.
 The Government is providing increased access to edu-
 cation, health, and social services, through projects
 in both rural and urban areas. In education, the goals
 are to provide universal primary education by 1979
 and to strengthen vocational training. The Government
 is establishing a health delivery system designed to
 provide adequate medical services for the needy.
 The Government is also expanding sanitation facilities
 in rural and urban areas. It is instituting nutritional
 education and a program of subsidized, enriched foods
 for the poorest thirty percent of the population.
 Official efforts are hampered by an inefficient bureau-
 cracy, lack of funds, and political corruption. Indeed,
 there is considerable concern in Colombia over the
 destructive effect that large sums of money, derived
 from illicit trafficking of cocaine and marijuana, have
 on Colombian institutions and society. The complete
 reversal of the urban/rural population ratio, now
 67 percent urban and 33 percent rural respectively,
 within the past fifteen years has further strained
 government institutions. Some are near collapse.
 3. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Includ-
 ing:
 a. Freedom of Thought, Speech, Press, Religion
 and Assembly
 Freedom of speech, peaceful assembly, religious belief
 and the press are guaranteed by the Constitution and
 are observed in practice. However, the Constitution
 authorizes the President, with the approval of all
 his Ministers, to declare a state of siege in case
 of war or internal disturbances. The Constitution
 also provides that under these circumstances the
 Government may suspend existing laws. Congress continues
 to function during a state of siege. Although a state
 of siege has been in force off and on during the last
 thirty years, the pattern of respect for basic rights
 guaranteed by the Constitution has remained essentially
 unchanged.
 
 
 229
 On September 6, 1978, the Government promulgated a
 security statute under which, inter alia, it would
 be able to control radio and TV broadcasts or
 communications or commentaries relating to questions
 of public order, and fines have been levied against
 several stations. Labor unions are legal in Colombia
 and are quite active and vigorous. Strikes on such
 issues as wages and working conditions are permitted.
 In general, "political strikes", i.e., those judged
 to be motivated by politics and not by bread-and-butter,
 trade union issues, are illegal--but they do occur.
 b. Freedom of Movement within the Country, Foreign
 Travel and Emigration
 Travel controls within Colombia are limited to airport
 and highway document checks and inspection for illegal
 arms. Foreign residents seeking to leave the country
 must have an exit permit. Colombian resident visas
 are, in effect, work permits which must be renewed
 annually or when changing employment. There are no other
 restrictions on freedom of domestic or foreign travel
 or emigration.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 The Constitution confers on all Colombian citizens of both
 sexes, 21 years or older, the right to vote and to hold
 public office. This right is respected by the authorities.
 Political parties and leftist-oriented organizations
 operate legally and without official harrassment. Marxist-
 oriented guerrilla organizations that carry out acts of
 violence, murder and kidnapping are proscribed by law.
 National elections are held every four years and local
 elections every two years. The last national election
 was held in June 1978. The exercise of the franchise
 is respected by the authorities and elections are generally
 honest, but voter abstention is high. In 1978, approxi-
 mately 34 percent of the electorate participated in the
 presidential election. Those convicted of certain crimes
 can be disenfranchised. Public employees are not permitted
 to participate in politics.
 While women have equal civil and property rights, their
 role in Colombian society is limited. With growing urbani-
 zation and greater educational opportunities, a number of
 mostly upper-class women are becoming active participants
 and leaders on all levels of society.

 4. Government Attitude and Record Regarding Inter-
 national and Non-Governmental Investigation of
 Alleged Violation of Human Rights
 Under the administrations of President Turbay and his
 predecessor, high-ranking officials of the Government
 have gone on record favoring investigations of
 alleged violations of human rights by international
 organizations. At the same time, they have cautioned
 against interference in the internal affairs of other
 countries. Latin American solidarity and economic con-
 siderations weigh heavily in the Government of Colombia's
 public judgement of reported violations in neighboring
 countries.
 Dr. Diego Uribe Vargas, the author of two books on human
 rights, was named Colombia's Foreign Minister in
 September 1978.
 Colombia has ratified the American Convention on Human
 Rights.
