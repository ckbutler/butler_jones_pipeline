 MONGOLIAN PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC
 The Mongolian People's Republic is a communist country
 almost totally dominated by the Soviet Union. There is a
 paucity of information on Mongolia, and much of what is
 available comes directly from the Mongolian regime. The
 few resident diplomats and occasional visitors are mainly
 limited to the capital city of Ulaanbaatar and get only
 brief and opaque glimpses of Mongolian life in other parts
 of the country. The United States does not recognize, nor
 does it have diplomatic relations with, the Mongolian
 People's Republic.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 There is no information available concerning the use of
 torture by Mongolian authorities.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 There is no information available concerning cruel, inhuman
 or degrading treatment or punishment by Mongolian
 authorities.
 c. Disappearances
 There is no information available concerning disappearances.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 There is no information'available concerning arbitrary
 arrest or imprisonment by Mongolian authorities.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 From the 1920s to 1949, Mongolian history included a series
 of Soviet-type purges apd trials based on secret police
 methods and trumped-up evidence. The civil and criminal
 codes written in 1949 stipulate the right of the accused to
 judicial process, a legal defense, and an open trial
 "except as stipulated by law." Since the criminal code
 places heavy emphasis on crimes against the state and
 permits star chamber proceedings in such cases, and since
 the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party (MPRP) controls
 all legal systems, those accused of serious crimes are
 unlikely to receive due process.
 f. Invasion of the Home
 There is no information available concerning the invasion
 of the home by Mongolian authorities.
 2. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 The Mongolian constitution provides for freedom of speech,
 demonstration and assembly, and the supreme court is
 responsible for guaranteeing the constitutional rights of
 individuals. The constitution specifically states, however,
 that these "freedoms" are provided "in order to strengthen
 the socialist state system of the Mongolian People's
 Republic"; exercise of these freedoms in ways not viewed as
 (649)

 contributing to this goal would likely result in arrest and
 detention. Control is exercised through various mass
 organizations extending down to the block committee level.
 The current Mongolian regime strictly controls religion.
 As a consequence, the Buddhist church, which was a central
 force in Mongolian life sixty years ago, has been reduced
 to a few showcase monasteries and a handful of monks, who
 serve primarily as propagandists for Soviet attempts to
 manipulate the international Buddhist movement.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country,
 Foreign Travel, Emigration and Repatriation
 Few Mongolians travel abroad, even to the Soviet Union, and
 none who'have done so are known to have requested
 repatriation to Mongolia. All Mongolians over 16 years of
 age must have internal passports and must obtain permission
 from the militia in order to travel from one area of the
 country to another.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 The Mongolian Communist Party does not tolerate political
 groups outside its control. Communist Party organization
 is hierarchical, and it is assumed that lower-ranking mem-
 bers have no real ability to influence or criticize the
 decisions of superiors.
 The cnstitution provides that all citizens over 18 (except
 the mentally ill) have the right to vote and to be elected.
 The constitution also provides for equal rights irre-
 spective of nationality or religion. There is no evidence,
 however, of religious persons or of those other than the
 dominant Khalka Mongols occupying elite party or
 "government" positions. In elections, only one candidate
 is listed for each office, so the choice is to vote for him
 or to cross out his name. Many elections result in a
 reported 99.9% turnout, with the winning candidate
 receiving 99.9% of the vote. The method for participating
 fully in the political process is through joining the
 Mongolian People' a Revolutionary Party and moving up
 carefully through the party ranks.
 3. Government Attitude and Record Regarding
 International and Non-governmental Investigation of
 Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Mongolian accession to the United Nations Covenant on Civil
 and Political Rights came into force on the same day as
 that of the Soviet Union, March 23, 1976. Although the
 Mongolians have acceded to this covenant, the current
 Mongolian regime has consistently echoed the Soviet human
 rights policy and practice, whether or not it is consistent
 with the covenant. There have been no known opportunities
 for outside investigators to examine human rights
 violations by the Mongolian People's Republic. It is
 highly unlikely that Mongolian officials wou.Ld permit such
 investigation by any outside authority or organization.
 4. Economic and Social Circumstances
 While it is impossible to verify the economic claims of the
 current regime, it seems likely that the daily lot of most
 Mongolians has improved when compared to conditions before
 the revolution. For example, Mongolian figures indicate
 that there were 20.9 physicians per 10,000 population in
 1978 as opposed to .03 physicians per 10,000 in 1925.
 Other data indicate similar improvements in education,
 employment, and food production.

 World Bank figures on the economy and society (although
 limited) tend to confirm Mongolian claims of a higher
 standard of living. For example, life expectancy at birth
 rose from 52 years in 1960 to 63 years in 1979.
 Adjusted primary school enrollment increased from 79
 percent in 1960 to 108 percent (indicating a large
 proportion of the students are above or below the official
 primary school ages) in 1978. There appears to be little
 sex discrimination in primary education since the adjusted
 enrollment percentage for males was only six points higher
 than for females. The percentage of calories available
 for consumption relative to nutritional needs reached 104
 per cent in 1977. GNP per capita in 1979 was 780 U.S.
 dollars. The population growth rate remained constant at
 2.9 percent throughout the 1960's and 1970's. The extent
 of disparity between urban dwellers and the rural popula-
 tion is unknown, but it is reasonable to assume that the
 availability of goods and basic services such as education
 and medicine is greater in the cities than in the
 countryside.
 Despite this substantial rise in the Mongolian standard of
 living over the last fifty years, the country remains
 extremely backward. An inefficient and over-centralized
 bureaucracy, a centrally-run economy integrally
 incorporated with the Committee for Mutual Economic
 Assistance and designed to serve Soviet rather than
 Mongolian interests, a lack of resources, extreme
 geographic isolation, and a severe climate conspire to keep
 the quality of Mongolian life poor by any objective
 international standard.
