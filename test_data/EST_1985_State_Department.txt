 ESTONIA'
 An independent Baltic state between the two World Wars,
 Estonia was annexed by the Soviet Union in 1940 as a
 constituent republic of the U.S.SR. The United States does
 not recognize the forcible incorporation of Estonia into the
 U.S.S.R.
 Like the other Baltic states, Estonia is subjected to the same
 centralized rule, the same Constitution and system of justice,
 the same restrictions on civil and political liberties, and
 the same police controls as the republics of the Soviet
 State. In addition, Soviet policy toward the Estonian nation
 arouses fear of Russification and of the destruction of
 Estonian values. Because of a low birthrate and the influx of
 Slavic settlers in recent years, Estonians now make up only 63
 percent of the total population as compared to 92 percent in
 1939.
 The standard of living in Estonia is higher than the Soviet
 average. In recent years, however, a decline in food supplies
 and in some consumer goods has caused popular discontent. The
 manner of Soviet exploitation of Estonian natural resources
 has also been criticized.
 Serious human rights violations continued in Estonia in 1985.
 Any manifestation of national rights is harshly repressed by
 Soviet authorities. Attempts to keep religious faith alive
 are countered by Soviet harassment of religious leaders.
 Estonians involved in human rights issues have also been
 severely punished with prison sentences.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 Although Estonian activists have on occasion died in Soviet
 custody, it is difficult to establish official responsibility
 for the deaths of persons involved in political dissent.
 Soviet persecution of those attempting to defend Estonian
 national rights, however, may lead to their deaths. Activist
 Johannes Hint died in Soviet custody in 1985.
 b. Disappearance
 There are no known instances of permanent or prolonged
 disappearance.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 In Estonia, as throughout the Soviet system, cruel and inhuman
 treatment of political prisoners occurs during both
 interrogation and confinement in labor camp, prison, or
 psychiatric hospital. Physical and psychological abuse of
 * Given Soviet control over all aspects of life in Estonia,
 the systemic human rights abuses described in the report on
 the U.S.S.R. apply also to Estonia. This report discusses
 only instances of repression specific to Estonia.

 prisoners is common, as is detention under extremely unhealthy
 or otherwise onerous conditions.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Soviet laws are written and interpreted in so broad a manner
 that persons may be arrested and sentenced for exercising
 basic human rights.
 On July 19 Estonian human rights activist Robert Vaitmaa was
 sentenced to 3 years in labor camp on a charge of "resisting
 the authorities." Vaitmaa had been arrested on May 7 after
 being forcibly removed from a plane while on his way to visit
 exiled Estonian activist Tiit Madison.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Despite guarantees of judicial objectivity in both the
 Estonian and Soviet Constitutions, the State completely
 controls the judicial process and, in political cases,
 arbitrarily decides the outcome of all trials to suit its
 requirements. No rights of a defendant override the
 self-determined compelling needs of the State.
 Lutheran pastor Harri Motsnik was arrested on April 13
 following a search of his home and charged with "anti-Soviet
 agitation and propaganda." Although reportedly convicted, the
 exact results of his trial, scheduled for August, had not
 reached the West by year's end.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Government interference in personal life is pervasive through
 its use of informers, mail censorship, electronic monitoring
 of telephones, and other devices. Contacts between Estonians
 and visitors from foreign countries are strongly discouraged,
 and those who indulge in such contacts are subject to
 harassment by the authorities.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution provides for most internationally accepted
 political liberties provided that their exercise accords with
 the strengthening and security of the Socialist system. In
 practice, the authorities do not tolerate dissident behavior.
 All legal means of publication are under the complete control
 of the party and the State. Because of their proximity to
 Finland, however, Estonians have access to Finnish television
 and radio broadcasts.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Constitution provides for the right to associate in public
 organizations, but the authorities subject all associations
 and organizations to their strict control.
 Beginning in April 1985, a number of prominent Estonian
 intellectuals were called in for questioning by the security
 police (KGB). They included Vardo Rumessen, a pianist and
 musicologist; Arvo Vallikivi, a writer; Rein Einasto, a
 scientist at the Estonian Academy of Sciences Institute of
 
 
 966
 ESTONIA
 Geology; Rein Ruutsoo, a philosopher; Haljand Udam, a Persian
 scholar; and several others. Questioning centered on contacts
 with former Estonian prisoner of conscience Mati Kiirend,
 musicologist Helju Tauk, and others.
 Soviet labor law and practice is enforced in Estonia.
 Although the Constitution guarantees all Soviet citizens the
 right to form trade unions, any efforts by workers to exercise
 this right independently of state-sponsored and controlled
 unions have been brutally repressed. Given Soviet concern
 that the ideas of the Polish Solidarity trade union movement
 might spread, this has been especially true in the Baltic
 states. In Estonia, the party leadership has denounced local
 efforts to call strikes at state enterprises.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 In spite of constitutional guarantees of the right to profess
 or not to profess any religion, religious believers are
 subject to many restrictions. As part of a Soviet program to
 reduce the authority and activities of the Lutheran Church,
 many Lutheran pastors have been called in for questioning in
 recent years, and the professional licenses of several have
 been revoked.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Freedom of movement is neither guaranteed by law nor respected
 in practice. The right to leave one's country and return is
 also not recognized. Worker Enn Veerpalu was reportedly
 convicted in 1985 for "illegally attempting to leave the
 Soviet Union."
 Soviet authorities in Estonia do not respect the right of
 emigration. Two Estonian families remain on the U.S.
 Government Representation List of Divided Families who have
 been refused permission to join relatives in the United
 States. Many Estonian Jews have also been repeatedly denied
 permission to emigrate. One well-known case of Soviet denial
 of this basic human right concerns two-year-old Kaisa
 Randpere, daughter of former Estonian Justice Ministry
 official Valdo Randpere. Randpere and his wife, singer Leila
 Miller, defected to Sweden in 1984. Soviet authorities have
 refused to allow Kaisa to join her parents, reportedly
 informing them "you will never see her again."
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Soviet authorities attempt strictly to forbid political
 activity outside the framework of the Communist Party. In
 Estonia, ethnic Estonlans comprise only 52 percent of the
 membership as compared to their 63 percent share of the total
 population.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Soviet Government rejects any foreign criticism of its
 human rights record, maintaining that all internationally
 recognized human rights are fully protected. Its attitude

 ESTONIA
 toward investigation of the human rights situation in Estonia
 is uncompromisingly negative.
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 By Soviet standards, Estonia's 1.5 million population enjoys a
 high standard of living and an advanced industry. In recent
 years, however, a decline in food supplies and a reduction in
 some consumer goods have caused discontent. Soviet statistics
 reveal a poor economic performance by Estonia during the first
 6 months of 1985. According to these statistics, Estonia
 posted industrial growth of only 1.9 percent, well below the
 1984 growth rate of 4.5 percent, and an increase in labor
 productivity of only 2.4 percent, again below the 1984 rate of
 4.2 percent. Economic performance in 1985 was subpar even
 relative to the other Baltic republics and the Soviet Union as
 a whole.
 The exploitation of Estonia's oil shale under central Soviet
 control has provoked sharp criticism in Estonia. Used for
 thermal energy production and for the chemical industry, the
 deposits have been exploited at an accelerating rate, although
 only about a third of the electrical energy produced from this
 source can be used in Estonia. In addition to the rapid
 depletion of a national resource, the enormous amount of
 pollution and environmental damage caused by shale
 exploitation has aroused concern.
 Estonian-Russian tensions are always close to the surface in
 Estonia; they appear to be increasing as the proportion of the
 Russian-speaking population grows. One manifestation of this
 is the reluctance of Estonians to learn or use the Russian
 language. In 1979, only 24 percent of Estonians said they
 spoke Russian well, a decline of 5 percent from 1970.
 Estonians are under strong pressure to pursue Russian-language
 programs. At the university level, particularly in the
 sciences, courses are often taught in Russian, even when
 Estonians make up the majority of a class. The nationalist
 demonstrations by thousands of Estonian high school students
 in October 1980, ruthlessly suppressed by the security forces,
 have not been forgotten.
