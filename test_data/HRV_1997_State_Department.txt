 CROATIA
 The Republic of Croatia is a constitutional parliamentary democracy with apow-
 erful presidency. The ruling Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ) has maintained
 power since independence in 1991, using its entrenched majority position to deny
 opposition parties the ability to compete on fair and equal terms in elections. Presi-
 dent Franjo Tudjman, the HDZ leader, was reelected in June for a second 5-year
 term in an election that observers considered "fundamentally flawed." The President
 serves as head of state and commander of the armed forces, chairs the influential
 National Defense and Security Council, appoints the prime minister who leads the
 government, and approves senior appointments in local government. Government in-
 fluence circumscribes and weakens the judiciary. This, combined with the extensive
 constitutional powers of the presidency, the overwhelming dominance of the HDZ,
 its absolute control of television, and the continuing concentration of power within
 the one-party central government, makes Croatia's nominally democratic system in
 reality authoritarian.
 The Ministry of Interior oversees the police, and the Ministry of Defense oversees
 the military. Civilian police have no authority over the military police or over uni-
 formed military personnel. The national police have primary responsibility for inter-
 nal security but, in times of disorder, the Government may call on the army to pro-
 vide security. Both the police and the army are responsible for external security. Al-
 though the civilian authorities generally maintain effective control of the profes-
 sional security forces, some members of the police and armed forces committed
 human rights abuses.
 The economy is slowly changing to a market-based free enterprise system, and ag-
 riculture is mostly in private hands. Family-owned small enterprises are multiply-
 ing, but industry is still largely state controlled. The Government's privatization
 program came under increasing criticism for allotting shares in prime enterprises
 to those loyal to the ruling party. While the economy recovered somewhat from the
 devastation inflicted by the war in 1991, the standard of living remained below pre-
 war levels. Unemployment is high, and accusations of government cronyism were
 common.
 The Government's human rights record remained poor, although significant im-
 provement was seen in certain areas. It continued to allow serious abuses, particu-
 larly regarding the treatment of ethnic Serbs. The Government has still not estab-
 lished adequate civil authority in the former occupied areas (the Krajina and West-
 ern Slavonia), and the police were unwilling or unable to take effective action
 against criminal activity against ethnic Serbs. Looting and threats were common.
 Beatings and murders still occur, although less frequently than in the past. The re-
 sponse by police was often apathetic, and the Government made little or no effort
 to seek out, investigate, and punish those responsible for such abuses. Cases of
 abuse from 1995, the victims of which were almost exclusively ethnic Serbs, re-
 mained mostly unresolved.
 According to credible reports, the police occasionally beat persons. The Govern-
 ment does not always respect due process provisions for arrest and detention. The
 judicial system is subject to executive influence, and the Government carried out a
 purge of judges and state attorneys that further called into question the independ-
 ence of the judiciary. The courts are burdened by a huge case backlog and some-
 times deny citizens fair trials.
 While in general the Constitution and laws provide for a broad range of human
 rights, in practice the Government continued to implement the law in a discrimina-
 tory fashion. The Government infringed on press freedom and used the courts and
 administrative bodies selectively to shut down or restrain newspapers and radio sta-
 tions that criticized the Government. Government intimidation induced self-censor-
 ship by journalists. The Government exercised provisions of the Criminal Code that
 allowed it to prosecute those who insult high officials in the press or who make
 statements which might cause public instability (at times subjectively defined to
 allow judicial action against opinions contrary to the ruling party). The right of as-
 sociation was circumscribed by a new law in June. In two sets of elections, the Gov-
 ernment seriously infringed upon the right of citizens to change their government
 
 
 1030
 freely by its almost total control of the electronic media. It also used manipulation
 of laws, harassment, and economic pressure to control the political process.
 Although significant progress was made in the provision of citizenship documents
 to ethnic Serbs in Eastern Slavonia, the last remaining Serb-held enclave, the Gov-
 ernment refused to allow ethnic Serbs who had fled Croatia during the military con-
 flict in 1995 to return or vote, effectively exiling and disenfranchising at least
 180,000 people. Military and police forces, contrary to officially stated government
 policy, continued to carry out forced evictions, although fewer than in previous
 years. Local officials also allowed ethnic Croat refugees from   Bosnia and
 Herzegovina and Serbia-Montenegro to dispossess ethnic Serb property owners. The
 record of cooperation by government authorities with international human rights
 and monitorng organizations was mixed. Violence and discrimination against
 women remained problems. Discrimination in the administration of justice, housing,
 and jobs against ethnic Serbs and against those who were not members of the ruling
 party was common. Isolated incidents of ethnically motivated killings and mob vio-
 lence occurred. Roma also faced discrimination.
 The United Nations Transitional Administration for Eastern Slavonia (UNTAES)
 maintained executive authority for the region through January 15, 1998, when the
 United Nations Security Council concluded that sufficient progress toward re-
 integration had been made and ended UNTAES mandate. By August the Govern-
 ment had provided citizenship documents to over 145,000 ethnic Serbs in the region,
 a significant number of whom were Croatian Serbs, now refugees in the Federal Re-
 public of Yugoslavia ("FRY") and Bosnia and Hezegovina, who came across the po-
 rous border with Yugoslavia to apply. The Government issued employment contracts
 for Serbs working in enterprises and public offices that were reintegrated into the
 Croatian system, thereby boosting local Serbs' confidence in their future in the re-
 gion. Elections for local governments and the upper house of Parliament were held
 in April and presidential elections were held in June, simultaneously in the region
 and in the rest of Croatia. A significant number of ethnic Serb representatives were
 elected to local government bodies. While police remained under the control of
 UNTAES, they were increasingly brought into alignment with the Ministry of Inte-
 rior. Following the April elections, an ethnic Serb assistant minister of interior was
 appointed. Most significantly, by September some 8,000 Croatian Serbs had left
 UNTAES region for their homes in other parts of Croatia, and a proximately 1,500
 Croats had returned to their homes in Eastern Slavonia. Overal freedom of move-
 ment into and out of UNTAES region increased significantly.
 While senior government leaders were cooperative, some government officials and
 local offices often refused to carry out central government directives. Increased ac-
 cess to the Danubian region led to a growing number of incidents of harassment of
 the ethnic Serbs living in the region by ethnic Croats, although these incidents are
 small in number compared to the large numbers of people moving back and forth.
 A significant number of these incidents of harassment were carried out by Croatian
 members of the Transitional Police Force or local Croatian officials. Ethnic Croat
 police officers at times were biased in their treatment of ethnic Serbs in the region.
 Human rights advances included the ratification in September of the European
 convention on human rights, a notable acceleration in the return of internally dis-
 placed Serbs to their former homes in government-controlled territory, and the pas-
 sage of a law allowing for primary education in minority languages. In addition, the
 courts late in the year revised some of the more discriminatory parts of a law that
 effectively expropriated the property of many minority Serbs who fled Croatia in
 1995, but there is still no effective mechanism by which Serb owners can recover
 their property.
 In a major step, Croatia facilitated the handover in October of 10 Bosnian Croats
 indicted by the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY)
 in the Hague, including Dario Kordic, one of the most wanted suspects indicted by
 the tribunal. Also in October, the Government committed to a plan by which it
 would inform ICTY- of new cases of potential interest to the tribunal. However, de-
 spite these very positive developments, Croatia's overall cooperation with the tribu-
 nal remained uneven. Other handovers occurred oniy under international pressure,
 the proposed plan remained unimplemented, and by September no progress had
 been made in the handover of documents that would assist in the prosecution of eth-
 nic Croats in custody in the Hague.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political or
 other extrajudicial killings by government officials. There continue to be some re-
 
 
 1031
 ports of ethnically motivated killings by unknown persons in the parts of Croatia
 reclaimed by the Government's "Operation Storm" in 1995. While the numbers are
 small the majority of those killed were ethnic Serbs. The murders continue a pat-
 tern begun in the fall of 1995 of ethnically motivated killings carried out both to
 intimidate Serbs who stayed behind after Croatia reclaimed these areas and in-
 creasingly to discourage those Serbs who fled from returning. The authorities made
 only a few arrests in these cases, often denying that any of the attacks were eth-
 nically motivated. The authorities' attempts to seek out, investigate, and punish
 those responsible for such murders were inadequate.
 Mines and explosive booby traps were used as devices to terrify returnees and
 those who remained in the formerly occupied areas. For example, in January and
 February the home of an ethnic Serb was attacked four times with hand grenades
 in Biskpija. In April a Serb returnee was killed by an explosion caused by a booby
 trap placed in a haystack in his field in Josani. Also in April, two elderly Serbs were
 shot and killed in Western Slavonia, and in yet another incident, a Serb who stayed
 was killed and buried in his yard by ethnic Croats from Kosovo. The Organization
 for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) reported the case of a woman in
 Medak who was seriously injured when a grenade was placed under her pillow. This
 series of individual attacks and murders culminated in the area around Hrvatska
 Kostajnica in May, when several hundred Bosnian Croats went on a rampage over
 2 days, burning and vandalizin Serb homes, beating and terrorizing Serb returnees
 and residents. One individual ied shortly after from injuries sustained during the
 riots. There were reports that police participated in the riots and destruction (see
 Section 5). This incident drew extensive international censure of Croatia's seeming
 lack of concern over the physical security of its ethnic Serb citizens (see Section 5).
 In most cases, authorities denied that there was any ethnic motivation to the
 crimes, a statement viewed with widespread disbelief in the international commu-
 nity. Authorities also justified these incidents as "spontaneous" reactions to return-
 ing Serb "provocations" and, other than Hrvatska Kostajnica, there was little or no
 official recognition or condemnation of the attacks.
 The case of an elderly couple of mixed ethnicity killed in September in Bukovica
 was resolved, and two people were arrested. The United Nations Special Rapporteur
 for Human Rights noted that, while there has been some progress in more recent
 incidents, major crimes that occurred at or near the time of Croatia's military oper-
 ations in the summer of 1995 (e.g. the Grubori murders) remain for the most part
 unresolved.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 By yeas end, government figures showed 2,156 citizens still missing in cases un-
 resolved from the 1991-92 war and the 1995 military actions. The Government esti-
 mates that approximately 1,380 of these are from the Danubian region, while the
 remainder are thought by the Government to be buried in the formerly Serb-held
 area of Croatia known as the Krajina. Steady progress was made throughout the
 year in removing names from the list of the missing as a result of the identification
 of corpses exhumed in the Krajina region and Eastern and Western Slavonia.
 Identification of the 200 corpses exhumed from the mass grave at Ovcara contin-
 ued throughout 1997, with a total of 83 positively identified by September. Exhuma-
 tion of another mass grave in Lovas revealed the bodies of 68 persons in June, of
 whom 67 were positively identified. Exhumations also took place in Topusko, Glina
 Petrinja, Gvozil, Dvor, Kostajnica, Dubica, Saborsko, Slunj, Cetingrad, and
 Skabrnja.
 Significant progress was made in the exchange of information between the coun-
 tries of the former Yugoslavia under the auspices of the International Commission
 on Missing Persons. Croatia participated in meetings with counterparts from the
 "Federal Republic of Yugoslavia' and Bosnia and Herzegovina. However, inter-
 national observers concluded that the political will to make unilateral disclosures
 of information relating to missing persons was lacking, as evidenced by the Govern-
 ment's release of 18 prisoners of war held in defiance of international conventions
 only after a commensurate release or exchange of information by the Bosnian Serb
 entity (see Section 2.d.).
 The body of the pilot Rudolf Perisin, long sought by the Government, was finally
 handed over by Bosnian Serb forces in August, along with the remains of a total
 of 18 others on the list of missing persons.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution prohibits torture or cruel or degrading punishment, and no evi-
 dence emerged of systematic abuse by police and government forces. There were,
 however, occasional credible reports that police beat persons, for example, in the
 case of ethnic Serb and mixed-marriage returnees detained after the incidents in
 Hrvatska Kostajnica.
 
 
 1032
 Police reportedly participated in the riots and destruction in Hrvatska Kostajnica
 in May and also harassed Orthodox worshipers, incited anti-Orthodox mob action,
 and did not safeguard citizens from abuse (see Sections L.a., 2a.c. and 5).
 Prison conditions meet minimum international standards. Jails are crowded, but
 not excessively so, and family visits and access to counsel are generally available.
 Rebel Serb detainees reported good treatment, although some asserted that they
 were treated less favorably than common criminals.
 The Government permits visits by human rights monitors. Prisons and detainees
 in Eastern Slavonia were monitored under the auspices of UNTAES.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution contains provisions to
 protect the legal rights of all accused persons, but the Government does not always
 respect these rights in practice. Over the course of the year, the Government issued
 numerous confusing and contradictory statements on the implementation of general
 amnesty legislation for rebel Serbs adopted in September 1996. The issuance of
 lists, both genuine and false, of wanted suspects and then their subsequent dis-
 avowal by the Government largely undermined the positive effect of the amnesty
 and was widely viewed by international observers as a ploy to instill insecurity and
 fear in the minority Serb population. In several well-documented instances, persons
 were arrested and tried who were not mentioned on any of the government lists,
 and in other cases, Serbs leaving the region were picked up for "questioning" relat-
 ing to their activity during the war. The Government claims that over 12,000 per-
 sons have been amnestied, although there has been no supporting documentation
 to confirm this claim. An additional 301 persons (primarily ethnic Croats) received
 amnesty at midyear, on the national day. Of 27 people rearrested after having ini-
 tially received amnesty in 1996, 24 still remain in custody while the Government
 retries them under provisions of the legal code covering war crimes. The charges
 were merely reworded versions of the indictments under which these individuals
 had already received amnesty.
 Police normally seek arrest warrants by presenting evidence of probable cause to
 an investigative magistrate. Police may carry out arrests without a warrant if they
 believe suspects might flee, destroy evidence, or commit other crimes. Such cases
 are not uncommon. The police then have 24 hours in which to justify their decision
 before the local investigative magistrate.
 After arrest, the law states that persons must be given access to an attorney of
 their choice within 24 hours; if they have no attorney and are charged with a crime
 for which the sentence is over 10 years' imprisonment, the investigative magistrate
 appoints counsel from a list of public defenders. If the potential sentence is under
 10 years, detainees can request court-appointed counsel if they choose. The court ap-
 points counsel after charges are levied for the trial. The investigative magistrate
 must, within 48 hours of the arrest, decide whether sufficient cause exists to hold
 a person in custody pending further investigation. The judge must justify the deci-
 sion in writing, including the length of detention ordered, which may not be longer
 than 1 month without review. The review by the county court may extend the period
 another 2 months if necessary. The usual period of investigative detention varies
 from a few days to a -few weeks, but the Supreme Court may grant the state an
 additional 3 months (for a total of not more than 6 months of pretrial detention)
 in exceptional cases. These decisions may be appealed, either immediately or later
 in the detention period. Once the investigation is complete, detainees are usually
 released on their own recognizance pending trial, unless the crime is a major of-
 fense, the accused are considered a public danger, or the court believes that they
 maiy flee.
 However, those persons held under investigative detention are often denied the
 right to have an attorney present during parts of the investigative stage or an ap-
 peal of investigative detention. In practice detainees are almost always bound over
 or investigation unless it is clear that no case exists against them. There are provi-
 sions for posting bail after charges are brought, but the practice is not common. Po-
 lice sometimes retain the passports of those released to prevent them from leaving
 the country. The International Committee of the Red Cross estimated that approxi-
 mately 79 ethnic Serbs were still in detention for acts related to the conflicts in
 1995.
 UNTARS maintained oversight over the judiciary and the police in Eastern
 Slavonia, and in August the process of reintegrating the judiciary into the Croatian
 system was begun under UNTAES supervision. However, despite UNTAES over-
 sight, several instances of lengthy pretrial detention, one as long as 2 years, were
 reported in the region.
 In a positive development, by August the Government had released all but 1 of
 the remaining 18 Bosnian prisoners of war. Des ite the provisions of the Dayton
 Peace Accords, these men were in captivity for atmost 2 years. The one remaining
 
 
 1033
 risoner, although nominally freed by the Government, refused repatriation to
 osnia and Herzegovina and thus remained in detention in a refugee collective cen-
 ter on Obonjan Island.
 The Constitution prohibits the exile of citizens. However, Croatian Serbs who fled
 the conflict during the last 5 ybars remained effectively exiled from Croatia. Al-
 though the Government reversed its stated opposition to Serb return in July, it re-
 fuses to implement procedures by which Croatian Serb refugees can obtain docu-
 ments to enable them to return. The Government's inability to create secure condi-
 tions in the formerly occupied areas, the complete absence of a true atmosphere of
 reconciliation, and the slow pace in issuing identity papers to Serbs abroad have
 combined to leave as many as 180,000 ethnic Serb former citizens of Croatia effec-
 tively without citizenship. While progress was made in the issuance of documents
 for Serbs in Eastern Slavonia, ethnic Muslims and Serbs currently -living in Croatia
 often had difficulty in obtaining citizenship, were denied citizenship or residency
 permits regardless of their previous residence, and were subject to exclusion and
 even deportation (see Section 5).
 The situation for Serbs in the area under UNTAES control improved markedly,
 as 145,000 Serbs received their identity documents by September at centers set up
 by the Croatian Office of Displaced Persons and Refugees and UNTABS. This very
 positive step also assisted many Croatian Serbs who crossed into the region from
 the Federal-Republic of Yugoslavia to bypass the bureaucratic obstacles that con-
 fronted Serbs at Croatian embassies abroad who sought to rectify their citizenship
 status. Although estimates vary widely, at least 30,000 to 40,000 Serb applications
 to return from Serbia-Montenegro remained stymied, while- many -in -Bosnia and
 Herzegovina found themselves unable to apply to return at all. As of December, the
 U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees estimated that approximately 10,000 ethnic
 Serbs had returned to Croatia proper (see Section 2.d.).
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-Government influence weakens the nominally
 independent judiciary.
 The independence of the judiciary was seriously called into question by govern.
 ment actions to purge .the judiciary of judges and attorneys who were either non-
 Croats or who were deemed to hold" pohitical 'views unsympathetic towards the cur-
 rent regime. Under legislation adopted in 1991, the State Judicial Council continued
 its review of judicial appointments and voted to relieve six sitting judges of their
 positions in late 1996, an action that the judges maintain was due to their "inde-
 pendent views." Despite the well-known shortage of experienced-judicial officers, in
 March six state attorneys in the ZaAeb municipal attorney's office were dismissed,
 allegedly due to their Serb or non-Croat origis. A similar case in April involved
 nine dismissals in Split, also allegedly based on ethnicity. The Chief Justice of the
 Supreme Court, Krunislav Olujic, was dismissed early in the year y the State Judi-
 cial Council for "behavior injurious to the reputation of the court.1He was alleged
 by the Council to have consorted with known criminals and to have had sex with
 underage persons. The procedures of his trial were questionable, since three mem-
 bers of the Council who were deciding his fate were also witnesses who testified
 against him. The subsequent challenges to the grounds of the dismissal were accom-
 panied by a lengthy public smear campaign carried out by national state-owned tele-
 vision and progovernment newspapers. The OSGE reported that Olujic's dismissal
 and the manner of it "put in question the separation of powers provided for by the
 Constitution." The U.N. Special Rap       or Human Rights noted that "key .as-
 pects of the proceedings against Dr. Olujic give me strong reason to believe that his
 dismissal may have been connected to his determination to work independently of
 the ruling HDZ political party."
 The judicial system consists of municipal and district courts, a Constitutional
 Court, a Supreme Court, an administrative court, and-a State Judicial Council. A
 parallel commercial court system handles all commercial and contractual disputes.
 The State Judicial Council (with a president and 14 members from all parts of the
 legal community) appoints judges and public prosecutors. The upper house of Par-
 liament nominates persons for membership on the State Judicial Council, and the
 lower house elects the members for 8-year terms. The 11 judges of the Constitu-
 tional Court are elected for 8-year terms in the same manner, while all other judges
 are apepointed for life.
 Although the Constitution provides for the right to a fair trial and a variety of
 due process rights in the courts, in practice the system is marred by both bureau-
 cratic inefficiency and outside, often political, influence. Numerous court cases drag
 on for years, due to the overburdene  an  understaffed courts and the inexperience
 of many newly appointed personnel. The backlog of cases in many courts is huge
 (for example, a reported 6,000 cases in the commercial court in Osijek alone). It is
 also not uncommon for the authorities to refuse to implement a court decision. For
 
 
 1034
 example, in numerous cases of illegal eviction (see Section 1.f.), court rulings in
 favor of those evicted, almost exclusively ethnic minorities (Serbs or Muslims) or
 former members of the Yugoslav army (JNA), remain unimplemented due to the re-
 fusal of police and local administrative authorities to carry out the court orders. The
 only recourse for the defendant is to return to court and seek yet another decision
 to demand implementation of the first, a time-consuming and lengthy process that
 still may not result in implementation. In other cases, nongovernmental organiza-
 tions (NGO's) documented numerous instances where the head of a family was de-
 nied citizenship on unclear or spurious grounds, while the rest of the family was
 granted it, thereby effectively excluding the entire family.
 The OSCE, the U.N. Center for Human Rights, and local NGO's all report that
 decisions handed down, in particular by the administrative courts (which rule on
 citizenship issues) are often improperly documented, arbitrary, and based on ques-
 tionable standards of evidence.For example, one NGO documented more than 900
 cases in Eastern Slavonia where Serbs, forced to request citizenship through natu-
 ralization (due to the loss or destruction of record books during the war), had their
 applications denied and received little or no explanation of the factual basis for the
 denial. Article 8 of the Citizenship Law provides two conditions for naturalization:
 that "a person has a place of residence for a period of not less than 5 years con-
 stantly on the territory of the republic of Croatia" and that "a conclusion can be de-
 rived from his or her conduct that he or she is attached to the legal system and
 customs in the Republic of Croatia. .. ." The lack of a written opinion substantiat-
 ing the basis for the denials made it virtually impossible to appeal these decisions.
 In addition, lawyers and international monitors claimed that the state's prosecution
 of war crimes cases is often based upon little factual evidence. For example, Milos
 Horvat, a Croatian Serb was extradited from Germany in order to face charges of
 war crimes in Croatia. In June the court found him guilty of genocide and sentenced
 him to 5 years in prison. The U.N. Center for Human Rights noted that "it was the
 widely held opinion of trial monitors that the evidence submitted by the prosecution
 was insufficient for a verdict of guilt, even less of genocide."
 The process of reintegrating the judiciary of Eastern Slavonia began in earnest
 in September, with the appointment of judges in the region. An ethnic Serb assist-
 ant minister of justice who was appointed following the April elections worked with
 the Government on this process. An agreement was reached in September between
 the Government and UNTAES, under which ethnic Serb attorneys from the region
 could defer payment of the necessary fee to register with the bar association (re-
 d of allpracticing attorneys in Croatia). This provided a measure of security
 ethnic Serb defendants that had hitherto been lacking and was a significant con-
 fidence-building measure.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution declares the home inviolable. Only a court may issue a search warrant,
 stating the justification for the search of a home or other premises. Police may enter
 a home without a warrant or the owner's consent only if necessary to enforce an
 arrest warrant, apprehend a suspect, or prevent serious danger to life or important
 property. While the authorities generally complied with these norms, there were no-
 table exceptions where the Government and, in particular the military, did not re-
 spect the inviolability of private property.
 Displaced ethnic Serb citizens were not allowed to move back in to their homes
 in numerous cases, even when those homes were empty. Soon after the military con-
 quests in 1995, the Government enacted legislation that effectively gave it the right
 to take over administratively all property that had been abandoned by fleeing rebel
 Serbs. Under the Law on the Temporary Takeover of Specified Property, the govern-
 ment-appointed housing commissions were authorized to allocate any property
 where the owner is absent in order to house refugees or other priority categories,
 such as widows, orphans, and war veterans. For example, the entire village of
 Kistanje was taken over for the use of Catholic refugees from the Kosovo area of
 the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, despite the fact that the Serb owners had ex-
 pressed their wish to return and occupy their former homes. By September more
 than 40 Serb families had returned to Kistanje, only to find their houses locked and
 guarded against their entry by the local police. In another example, the members
 of one family in Donji Lapac had been moved to three separate temporary accom-
 modations upon their return to Croatia, despite the fact that their own home was
 vacant. They were told that it had already been allocated for a Bosnian Croat refu-
 gee family. The law contains no provision for the return of property to its rightful
 owner after the hostilities ended and, in effect, permanently dispossesses them of
 their property. The Constitutional Court in late September declared certain ele-
 
 
 1035
 ments of this law unconstitutional, but it remained largely in force since no effective
 mechanism has yet been developed for restoringproperty to the original owners.
 Forced evictions of ethnic Serbs, Croats, and others from former Yugoslav Na-
 tional Army-(JNA) apartments continued in major cities throughout the year. The
 Ministry of Defense arbitrarily, revoked the tenancy rights of individuals who had
 lived in apartments for decades, and military police frequently took residences by
 force of arms, either evicting current tenants or forcing them to share quarters. The
 authorities justified their actions on the basis of property laws that remove tenancy
 rights as a result of any 6-month absence or if the tenant was ruled to have "acted
 a ainst the interests of the republic of Croatia." The courts' frequently used this leg-
 islation to deny tenancy rights to former JNA members and in other cases refused
 to recognize the rights of surviving family members to maintain the tenancy rights
 of their deceased or divorced spouses, although that is provided for specifically
 under the law. Membership in the JNA at any time by the primary tenancy rights
 holder was deemed sufficient to brand them as "enemies of the state." However, eth-
 nic Croats were not immune from forced evictions, nor did all cases involve former
 JNA members. Many cases were reported in which desirable apartments were sim-
 ply confiscated by individuals connected with either the military or the police. In
 one case in Zagreb, the owner of the home was allowed to stay- but was forced to
 share quarters with five interlopers, all of whom were-members of the police.
 Although such-evictions were often declared illegal in court, the occupier was sel-
 dom removed from the premises. In one example, a family illegally evicted from its
 apartment in Split by a uniformed member of the Croatian military police in 1994
 failed to regain possession of the property despite repeated favorable court rulings
 in bth the civilian and military courts. Each of the numerous- attempts to evict the
 intruder according to the court order has failed, -due to the nonattendance of nec-
 essary government officials. In the case of occupation by a refugee, the authorities
 forbid the police to remove the intruder on the basis of a- law requiring that a new
 home be found for a displaced or refugee family before it can be removed from any
 form of housing, whether legally occupied or hot.
 Incidents of looting continued almost unabated in the formerly occupied areas,
 particularly in the Krajina. International organizations such as the European Com-
 munity Monitoring Mission (ECMM) reported at least several cases weely, and one
 local NGO documented 150 cases of looting, threats, and beatings in the Krajina be-
 tween May and June alone. Police in the formerly Serb-held areas were often inef-
 fective in either responding to incidents or in resolving cases in which the victim
 was an ethnic Serb; in May the government human rights Ombudsman reported
 that there was a need to increase the number of police working in the area around
 Knin (former sector south). Accusations persisted that Serbs departing UNTAES re-
 gion were taking with them large amounts of Croatian homeowners' movable prop-
 erty. Des iteIJNTAES' efforts to determine the ownership of such articles, local offi-
 cials in Eastern Slavonia routinely issued documentation for goods that UNTAES
 was largely powerless to verify. However, incidents of property seizure in Eastern
 Slavonia were followed up with a vigor that was lacking in other areas of the coun-
 try.
 The Constitution provides for the secrecy and safety of personal data, and there
 were no reports that this provision was not respected. However, there was credible
 evidence that requests made by ethnic Serbs to return to their original homes in
 the formerly occupied areas of Croatia were sometimes used by government authori-
 ties as a basis upon which to quickl issue permission for Bosnian Croat refugees
 to occupy these Serb homes under the law on the temporary takeover of specified
 property.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom      of
 thought and expression, specifically including freedom of the press and other media
 of communication, speech and public expression, and free establishment of institu-
 tions of public communication. In practice, government influence on the media
 through state ownership of most print and broadcast outlets limits these freedoms.
 Government intimidation through the courts and other bodies, including administra-
 tive and regulatory bodies, also induced self-censorship. Journalists were reluctant
 to criticize the Government in public forums for fear of harassment, job loss, intimi-
 dation, criminal prosecution, or being branded as disloyal. The Government main-
 tained an unofficial campaign of harassment of the independent media throughout
 the year.
 Individuals may criticize the Government, although not always without reprisal.
 In August the Government brought charges against a leading human rights activist
 and a prominent politician for press statements, allegedly in violation of the Crimi-
 
 
 1036
 
 nal Code for "dissemination of false information." The Government alleged that
 these statements had been made with the express purpose of inciting political insta-
 bility in the country, notwithstanding the fact that the same and similar statements
 had been made by these individuals--with no ensuing public disorder-several
 years previously and that similar sentiments were expressed by others.
 In addition to the possible use of criminal prosecution against its critics, the Gov-
 ernment enjoys a virtual monopoly on print media distribution. Fees of 20 percent
 of gross sales (payable in advance), plus slow payment of proceeds from the distribu-
 tor to the publication, caused acute cash flow problems that forced one publication,
 the independent journal Arkzin, to change from weekly to monthly issuance. Jour-
 nals an newspapers also complained that they had little control over where their
 publications were sent, with large quantities at times being sent to remote villages,
 eaving the bigger, urban markets under-supplied.
 Despite continued domestic and international protests, the Government took no
 steps to revise articles of the Penal Code that authorize the criminal prosecution
 of journalists who insult the honor or dignity of the president, prime minister, the
 speaker of parliament, or the chief justices of either the Supreme Court or the Con-
 stitutional Court, as well as those who publish "state secrets." The three largest
 weekly newspapers-Globus, Nacional, and the Feral Tribune-face multiple libel
 suits under these provisions, many of which were brought by members of the Gov-
 ernment or of the President's family. Although the municipal court found the Feral
 Tribune innocent of one of the numerous libel charges in 1996, the prosecutor ap-
 pealed the case. The criminal trial of Globus journalist Davor Butkovic began in De-
 cember for libel against the Prime Minister. Butkovic is charged with criminal li-
 ability for citing a report by a foreign company in an article that alleged corruption
 in the Cabinet. Administrative proceedings continued against the independent radio
 station Radio 101 which was threatened again with closure when the commercial
 court demanded that it increase its operating capital to the equivalent of several
 hundred thousand dollars in order to renew its license. The ownership structure of
 the station complicated the situation: 75 percent is owned by employees and 25 per-
 cent by the city of Zagreb. Radio 101 was also informed that it must pay both its
 licensing fees and deposit the increased operating capital in advance of receiving its
 permanent license. Legal proceedings continued throughout the year, and the prob-
 lem of financial capital at the station remained severe. In a positive development,
 after another lengthy battle with administrative authorities, Radio 101 was award-
 ed a second transmitter, allowing the station to expand its coverage significantly in
 the Zagreb area.
 Both public and private radio and television broadcasting coexist, although the
 Government controls all national broadcasting. Opposition figures and human rights
 activists uniformly charge that state-run out lets have a strong progovernment bias.
 International observers also noted the continued role of the state-run media in stir-
 ring up public opinion on sensitive issues, such as the return of ethnic Serb dis-
 placed  persons. For    example, in   July  and   August, several   widely-read
 progoverment papers ran ugly and misleading articles, clearly designed to stir up
 public fear and anger against the return of ethnic Serbs and against those inter-
 national organizations that assist them.
 Regulations governing access to the state-owned broadcast media and editorial
 policies of the boards controlling the outlets restrict the ability of opposition parties
 to criticize government policies and, in the most visible example, prevented any
 semblance of free media access duringthe April and June electoral campaigns (see
 Section 3). Croatian State Radio and Television (HRT) broadcasts on three national
 television channels and three national radio channels. Technically under the super-
 vision of the Parliament, the HRT is, in practice, run by the ruling HDZ party, and
 its head is a leading member of the HDZ. Many members of the Telecommuni-
 cations Board (which regulates licensing) are also senior HDZ officials. The HRT
 unfailingly devotes its main news coverage to uncritical reports on the activities of
 the President and the Government and is virtually an organ of the executive
 branch. Reportingand commentary faithfully reflect the views of the Government,
 and little, if any,broadcast time is given for dissenting views. While local radio and
 television outlets exist throughout the country, they largely lack their own news and
 pubic affairs programs. A notable exception is the new y launched TV Mreza which
 has begun fairly objective, if somewhat limited, news production. Most radio sta-
 tions, however, repeat the HRT news, while some rebroadcast Voice of America and
 the British Broadcasting Corporation news programs.
 On October 23 broadcast media journalists established an Association of Elec-
 tronic Media Journalists in the Croatian Journalists Association and issued a mani-
 festo with 21 points in which they called for professional and open electronic media.
 The "Forum 21" members, 13 of whom work for state radio and television, came
 
 
 1037
 under immediate pressure and threats from the HDZ and the state-run media to
 curtail these outside activities.
 The lack of media freedom, in particular in the electronic media, was a major
 component in the OSCE's judgment that the process leading up to the presidential
 election in June was "fundamentally flawed" and did not meet minimum standards
 for a meaningful and democratic election in line with OSCE norms. A similar con-
 clusion was made about the parliamentary upper house and local elections in April.
 Throughout the year's election campaigns, the ruling party and its candidates en-
 joyed an immense advantage in media exposure and news coverage from the state-
 owned electronic media, the HRT. For example, during the final days of the presi-
 dential campaign, the main daily news program provided approximately 8 to 12
 times more coverage of the ruling candidate than of the 2 other candidates com-
 bined. Independent analysts also concluded that state-owned media downplayed cov-
 erage of events of significance to opposition candidates, including the violent attack
 on one presidential candidate in June. The coverage devoted to President Tudjman
 on the evening news program during one key election campaign period (from May
 28 to June 7) was 300 times greater than that given to the eventual second place
 candidate. Finally, the OSCE report itself was completely underplayed by the
 media, with the main government news program devoting a mere three-line state-
 ment to its release, while the independent news program had no coverage of the re-
 lease at all. The next day, the state-run media disingenuously reported that the
 OSCE report characterized the Croatian elections as "free" but left out the remain-
 der of the sentence, which continued "but not fair."
 Foreign newspapers and journals, including some Serbian periodicals, were avail-.
 able throughout the country.
 While academic freedom is generally respected, academicians were reluctant to
 speak out on political issues, and there was an increasing tendency by the ruling
 HDZ party to use-its influence in academia. For example, in a public exchange of
 letters, President Tudiman accused the then President of the Academy of Arts and
 Science, Ivan Supek, of plotting Tudjman's assassination after Supek made public
 statements critical of presidential policies.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 the right of peaceful assembly, and the Government generally respects this right in
 practice.
 Numerous rallies and demonstrations took place throughout the country during
 the year, the majority connected in some way with the two elections held in the
 spring and summer (see Section 3). Permits to hold rallies and assemblies were not
 always equitably issued. For instance, during the Presidential campaign in June,
 the police denied one major opposition party a permit to assemble in the main
 square in the capital on spurious grounds, after approving the earlier ap lications
 of the ruling and several other parties. Labor unions held various assemlies and
 demonstrations, as did associations of war veterans, pensioners, and the families of
 persons missing from the war. In Eastern Slavonia, local Serbs also held demonstra-
 tions, usually connected with the peaceful integration of the region, including one
 rally at which press reports indicated a crowd of 15,000 persons gathered in
 Vukovar in February.
 The Constitution provides for the right of association. However, this right was re-
 stricted by legislation passed in June, when the Parliament adopted a new Law on
 Associations. With this legislation, the Government gave itself broad supervisory
 powers to prevent the founding of an association and to monitor all aspects of an
 association once founded. For example, the law allows temporary suspension of the
 activities of an association based only upon a "well-founded" suspicion that the
 group's activities contravene the Constitution or law. Until such time as the associa-
 tion proves itself innocent in a court of law, the government can keep it closed in-
 definitely and appoint someone to manage and dispose of the association's property.
 The law also grants the Government the power to dissolve an association and dis-
 pose of its property or to impose significant fines for any proven violation if it deter-
 mines that the association has actually violated the Constitution or the law. Exer-
 cising the right of association before the Government approves the act of founding
 constitutes a violation.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of conscience and
 religion and free public profession of religious convictions, and the Government re-
 spects these rights in practice. There is no official state religion. All religious com-
 munities are free to conduct public services and to open and run social and chari-
 table institutions. Roman Catholicism, Eastern Orthodox Christianity, and Islam
 are the major faiths, and there is a small though active Jewish community. The
 great majority of Croats are Roman Catholic, and the Government provides optional
 Catholic religious training in schools.
 
 
 1038
 No formal restrictions are imposed on religious groups. The main mosque is in
 Zagreb, where it serves not only as a religious center but also as a social aid office
 for the large Bosnian Muslim refugee population. Croatian Protestants from a num-
 ber of denominations, as well as foreign clergy, actively practice and proselytize, as
 do representatives of Eastern-based religions. The Government tightened its resi-
 dence permit and visa issuance policy at midyear, but this was a general policy shift
 and not directed at religious workers (although they were among those affected). Al-
 though religious education is not in itself compulsory, all schools are required to
 offer classes in religion. Schools with large minority populations are allowed to offer
 classes in minority religions (i.e., Orthodox catechism in Serb majority schools).
 There were numerous reports that despite thefactthatreligioustraininginschools
 was not compulsory, students were subtly pressured to attend.
 Incidents occurred in which the police harassed those attending religious cere-
 monies, incited anti-Orthodox mob action, and refused to restrain those who sought
 to disrupt Orthodox rituals (see Section 5).
 The Government discriminates against Muslins in the issuance of citizenship doc-
 uments. The Interior Ministry frequently uses Article 26 of the Law on Citizenship
 to deny citizenship papers to persons otherwise qualified to be citizens (see Section
 5).
 d. Freedom of Movement With     te Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Constitution generally provides for these rights, with certain re-
 strictions. All persons legally in the country must register their residence with the
 local authorities. Under exceptional circumstances, the Government may legally re-
 strict the right to enter or leave the country if necessary to protect the "legal order,
 health, rights, or freedoms of others."
 The Government onrates with the Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for
 Refugees (UNHCR) and other humanitarian organizations assisting refugees. Cro-
 atia acceded to all treaties regarding the treatment and status of refge  and these
 have been observed in practice. The Government Office for Displaced Persons and
 Refugees reports that the Government is currently giving first asylum to 68,863 peo-
 ple from various parts of the former Yugoslavia as of December and that it was fi-
 nancially supporting another 101,616 internally displaced persons (not counting dis-
 placed ethic Serbs living in the area under UNTAES control). The Government
 also reports that another 20,599 people fall into the category of "refugee settlers"
 and are almost exclusively ethnic Croats. For much of the year, the Government re-
 fused to recognize ethnic Serbs displaced in Eastern Slavonia as displaced persons,
 terming them instead "internal migrants," and hence not warranting any special
 protected status. There were no reports of forced return of persons to a country
 ihere they feared persecution.
 In April the Government together with the UNHR and UNTAES developed a tri-
 lateral mechanism designed to initiate and facilitate the return of persons from
 Eastern Slavonia to the rest of Croatia. The Joint Working Group (JWG), as it was
 commonly known, created conditions and criteria by which persons could: register
 their intention to return; obtain a "confirmation for return" that verified the per-
 sons status; enjoy facilitated return; and register for reconstruction assistance. For
 those who did not wish to return to their former place of residence, an Agency for
 Property Negotiation was created that would assist in the buying and selling of
 homes.
 This otherwise positive development was tempered somewhat by the slow and un-
 even implementation of the agreement. Since the agreement was signed on April 23,
 the Office for Displaced Persons and Refugees, which had been delegated the task
 of rcessing the applications of those who sought to return, had approved only sev-
 eral thousand applications each way by mid-September and, of those approved, ap-
 proximately 2,500 people in total actually returned to their homes under this mech-
 anism. The Ministry of Reconstruction and Development, tasked by the Government
 through the JWG to provide reconstruction assistance and facilitate difficult returns
 (i.e., to occupied, damaged, or destroyed homes), produced approvals and reconstruc-
 tion assistance for only 9 families out of thousands of requests by mid-September,
 which effectively blocked numerous returns despite government promises.
 Confirmations were issued only slowly and then only for those persons whose
 homes were either vacant or easily reparable. Almost no pro ss was made on
 "hard cases"-those homes either severely damged or occupied by others. Given the
 long wait for government confirmation, many Serbs and Croats returned to their
 homes on their own. Outside the government mechanism and therefore not qualified
 for government benefits, these people did not receive social welfare payments or
 even assurance that their homes would not be taken from them under the law on
 the temporary takeover of specified property afterther return (see also Section 1.f.).
 However, in September the Government recognized ex post facto many of these
 
 
 1039
 
 "spontaneous returns" and granted returnee status to both Serbs and Croats who
 had thus far returned to their original place of residence outside of the trilateral
 mechanism.
 Freedom of movement was severely hampered by the occupation of homes belong-
 ing to ethnic Serb Croatian citizens by refugees from neighboring Bosnia and
 Herzegovina, as well as "priority category" ethnc Croat citizens, i.e., active duty or
 former members of the military, widows, and orphans. Legislation that allowed the
 government-appointed housing commissions to settle people in these homes provided
 no mechanism for their removal once the original owner returned to take up his
 property, evea after portions of the law were struck down by the Constitutional
 Court in September. The international community noted a concerted pattern of a-
 tivity by the Government to resettle areas that ormerly had Serb majorities with
 ethnic Croats, either from other parts of the former Yugoslavia, other parts of Cro-
 atia, or by encouraging the return of ethnic Croat migrs from abroad. Many ethnic
 Serbs returned to homes that the Government's Office for Displaced Persons and
 Refugees termed habitable but found them devastated and lootec.
 Whle UNTAES still controlled the border between Eastern Slavonia and Croatia
  roper, freedom of movement into and out of UNTAES-cntrolled region increased
 drmatically during the year, going from virtually no freedom to significant, albeit
 controlled, two-way movement, UNAE    inaugurated a system of sponsored visits
 whereby ethnic Croat former residents of the region could spend up to several days
 in the region and persons whose official business took them frequently into the re-
 gion were issued passes. Properly documented ethnic Serbs traveled out of the re-
 gion, visiting their homes in other parts of Croatia. In September UNTAES handed
 over control of the border checkpoints to the Transitional Police Force.
 The Government cntinued to move refugees and displaced persons from te-
 porary accommodations in coastal tourist facilitis. In many cases these people were
 resettled in third countries or elsewhere in Croatia.
 A significant number of persons, almost exclusively ethnic Croats, were assimi-
 lated into local Croatian communities, albeit not always willingy, and by year's end
 some 40,000 to 50,000 ethnic Croat refugees had their refugee status repaced with
 that of Croatian citizenship. For example, more than 11,000 ethnic Croat refugees
 in and around Slavonski Bre d had their status changed from refugee to that of tem-
 porary resident, thus removing their entitlement to special social allowances and
 benefits. Representatives of this group complained that their primary goal was to
 return to Bosnia and Herzegovina, rather than to assimilate into Croatia.
 ection 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The Government seriously infringed upon the right of citizens to change their gov-
 ernment peacefully. All citizens over 18 years of age and older have the right to vote
 .by secret ballot. The President, elected for 5 years, exercises substantial power, au-
 thority, and influence but is constitutionally limited to two terms. Parliament com-
 prises the House of Representatives and the House of Counties (Zupanije). The Cro-
 atian Democratic Union (HDZ) holds a majority in beth houses, and President
 Franjo Tudman was reelected in June in an election judged to be "fundamentally
 flawed" and "free but not faii" by the OSCE. Elections for all local governing bodies
 as well as the House of Counties were held in April, but were also marked by irreg-
 ularities including a lack of opposition access to the media and elections legislation
 weighted in favor of the ruling party.
 The presidential power of approving the Mayor of Zagreb (who is elected by the
 city assembly) was reaffirmed in legislation adopted in February. The April local
 elections, in which the HDZ won a plurality of seats and appointed a mayor,
 brought to an end the opposition boycott of the Zagreb city assembly (begun in late
 1996. The boycott was the result of President Tudjman's 1 0-year long refusal to
 confirm opposition mayoral candidates legally elected to the office. The "Zagreb city
 council crisis," as it came to be known, was a visible example of the ruling party's
 manipulation of politics that was only resolved through new elections. In addition
 to the liberal interpretation and implementation of laws to suit the Government's
 agenda, the ruling party used intimidation and harassment, as well as control of
 the media and government, to control the political process. Economic pressure was
 one of the most effective tools, and government agencies selectively issued or denied
 permits for businesses based on political affiliation.
 The HDZ used its control of Parliament to push through electoral changes that
 favored it. July 1996 amendments to the law for local elections, which included
 changing the proprtionamjoritarian ratio from 2/3:1/3 to 3/4:1/4, heavily favored
 the     nZ.u(Theda la  ocal elections were held with a 50:50 ratio; 1995 changes put
 the ratio at 2/3:1/3.) In addition, the HDZ fully exploited the July 1996 amendments
 
 
 1040
 allowing a party to put someone's name on its list as its "bearer," even if that per-
 son was not on the list, by placing President Tudjman's name at the head of every
 local list. In 1996 the Par iament passed gerrymandering legislation on redistricting
 that further helped the HDZ electorally. Changes to the electoral law were often
 done in "emergency parliamentary sessions" and pushed through hastily, with little
 debate.
 Rules for access to state-owned electronic media not only restricted the ability of
 opp.sition parties to criticize government policies and activities but limited their
 ability to fully engage the Government in an open political dialog (see Section 2.a.).
 These rules also severely hindered the opposition parties from mounting effective
 campaigns in the April local and parliamentary upper house and June presidential
 elections. In addition to strict control of the media, opposition candidates were at
 times the victims of violent attacks. During the presidential campaign in June, the
 Liberal Party (-SIS) candidate was attacked by an army captain while addressing
 a rally in Pula and suffered a concussion. His assailant received a suspended sen-
 tence. In April the leader of the Social Democratic Union (SDU) was attacked in
 Osijek while preparing for a campaign rally. The Social Democrat (SDP) presidential
 candidate's car was attacked in May. Although the authorities apprehended the per-
 petrators, the incidents received no more than cursory coverage in the press. The
 Government did not allow the participation of domestic election monitors in either
 the April or June elections. A coalition of nongovernmental organizations, GONG
 (Citizens Organized to Oversee Voting), was formed in March but was denied per-
 mission to monitor either of the elections on the grounds that their activity was not
 expressly permitted by the election law.
 By the time of the April elections in sector east, which were called for under the
 basic agreement between the Government and the Eastern Slavonian Serbs and
 held concurrently with local and upper house elections throughout Croatia, the Gov-
 ernment had increased the pace of citizenship document (Domovnica) issuance for
 Serbs, thereby enabling them to participate in the political process. Initial intran-
 sigence on document issuance and the refusal to extend voting rights in Eastern
 Slavona for Serb citizens from other parts of Croatia (dropped in late 1996) forced
 the ballot to be delayed from the agreed-upon date of March 16 until April. The
 OSCE and UNTAES also judged that the Government's inability to effectively ora-
 nize the ballot (voters lists were incorrect and ballot papers were delayed or undeliv-
 ered entirely) on election day necessitated an extension of the balloting by over 24
 hours.
 The Governments discriminatory use of the citizenship law denied qualified Cro-
 atian Serbs residing outside of Croatia as refugees the ability to apply for and re-
 ceive citizenship, as well as the right to vote, effectively disenfranchising several
 hundred thousand ethnic Serbs (see Section 5).
 Although there are no legal restrictions on participation by women or minorities
 in the political process, they are represented in only small numbers in Parliament,
 the executive branch, and the courts. In the 206-member Parliament, 13 women
 hold seats. Election law requires representation for minorities in Parliament, with
 proportional representation for any minority that makes up more than 8 percent of
 the population. Currently, no minority meets that criteria. Representation for Cro-
 atia's Serb minority is based, however, on government estimates of the number of
 Serbs who fled Croatia between 1991-95 and the assumption that they will not re-
 turn. Under an agreement reached with UNTAES and the Serb leadership in Janu-
 ary, the Government committed itself to the appointment of two Serb representa-
 tives regardless of their percentage in the population once a census is eventually
 taken, There were no Muislim representatives in Parliament, despite the fact that
 the Muslim minority is the next largest after the Serbs.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Human rights groups throughout the country worked to prevent human rights
 abuses and brought their concerns to the attention of local and national authorities,
 as well as to that of domestic and international media. Most of these groups focused
 on legal advocacy programs and social services support for the remaining and re-
 turning population in the former Serb-held areas. Throughout the year, domestic
 human rights groups were highly critical of the Government's human rights record.
 A law on associations, or the "NGO law" as it came to be known, gave the Govern-
 ment broad authority to regulate domestic nongovernmental organizations. For ex-
 ample, if the Government only suspects that an organization is in violation of either
 the Constitution or the law, it may suspend the organization's activity until such
 time as the organization proves its innocence in the courts (see Section 2.b.). In a
 trial for tax evasion that was widely perceived to be politically motivated, two em-
 
 
 1041
 ployees of the local affiliate of the Soros Foundation, the Open Society Institute,
 were found guilty of "falsifying documents," and were sentenced to a year in prison
 by a Zagreb court in November. The sentence was immediately commuted to 3
 years' probation.
 International organizations including the European Community Monitoring Mis-
 sion (ECMM), the UNHCR, the OSCE, and the United Nations Special Rapporteur
 for Human Rights, moved freely throughout the country, reporting on human rights
 problems. These organizations usually, but not always, reported an adequate level
 of cooperation with government authorities in Zagreb. In the field, however, the
 Government's record of cooperation was mixed, with promises made in the capital
 often being poorly or incompletely implemented in the field. For example, despite
 repeated promises by the President and senior members of the Government that all
 Croatian Srbs who fled the military actions to retake the occupied areas could re-
 turn, the Government did little at its missions abroad to facilitate the return of
 these refugees, leaving approximately 180,000 Serbs effectively exiled from Croatia
 in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia alone (see Section 2.d.).
 UNTAES mandate, originally set to expire on January 15, was extended for 6
 months until July 15 and then again until January 15, 1998. One of the contribut-
 ing factors for the extension was the insufficient progress towards the peaceful re-
 integration of the last Serb-occupied enclave in Eastern Slavonia. UNTAES and the
 UNHCR together with the Government established a Joint Working Group on Re-
 turns, which developed a framework for the return of refugees and displaced per-
 sons to their homes in Croatia proper (see Section 2.d.).
 Domestic human rights groups reported that their activity was largely ignored by
 the Government. Unless a case received international attention through te media
 or an international organization, the Government took little or no action to address
 the problem cited. Although access to the Government improved slightly with the
 increased activity of the government-appointed human rights Ombudsman, the Om-
 budsman's lack of legal authority to rectify problems that came to his attention seri-
 ously limited his effectiveness to serve as anything other than a forum. Nonetheless,
 the Ombudsman's office became a welcome access point to the Government for both
 international organizations and NGO'S. In May the Ombudsman issued a harsh re-
 port criticizing security conditions in parts of the formerly-occupied areas (the first
 of its kind in Croatia), which was presented to the Parliament in the spring.
 In a major positive step, Croatia facilitated the handover in October of 10 Bosnian
 Croats indicted by the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia
 in the Hague, including Dario Kordic, one of the most wanted suspects indicted by
 tribunal. ]Zn April the Goenent handed over to the Tribunal indicted war crimi-
 nal Zlatko Aleksovski, who was in Croatian custody for 8 months. This brought the
 number of ethnic Croats indicted who were in custody in the Hague to 13, a major-
 ity of those indicted. Also in October, the Government committed to a plan by which
 it would inform ICTY of new cases of potential interest to the tribunal. However,
 despite these very positive developments, the Government's overall cooperation with
 the tribunal remained uneven, By year's end, no progress had been made in the
 handover of documents that would assist in the prosecution of ethnic Croats held
 in custody in the Hague, and the Government continued its strong rhetoric asserting
 that Croatia's sovereignty must be maintained at all costs, seriously bringing into
 question the Government's commitment to present the tribunal with new cases for
 review.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution specifies that all citizens shall enjoy all rights and freedoms, re-
 gardless of race, color, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or
 social origin, property, birth, education, social status, or other attributes. It adds
 that memibers of all national groups and minorities shall have equal rights. While
 the majority of these rights are observed in practice, serious deficiencies continued
 with regard to equality among various nationallraciallethnic groups. The Constitu-
 tion provides for special "warti~me measures" in case of need, but states that restric-
 tions shall be appropriate to the nature of the danger and may not result in the
 inequality of citizenship with respect to race, color, sex, language, religion, or na-
 tional or social origin.
 Women.-Although the Government does not collect statistics on the issue, in-
 formed observers believe that violence against women, including spousal abuse, is
 common. Alcohol abuse is commonly cited as a contributing factor. Centers for the
 psychological and medical care of abused women are open in several cities and a
 number of local institutions and voluntary agencies offer social, medical, and other
 
 
 1042
 assistance to abused women and to those traumatized by war experiences. Family
 crisis associations are also active.
 The law does not discriminate by gender. In practice, however, women generally
 hold lower paying positions in the work force. The Government has no recent data
 concerning the socio-economic standing of women. However, considerable anecdotal
 evidence suggests that women hold by far the preponderance of low-level clerical
 and shop-keeping positions, as well as primary and secondary school teaching jobs.
 Women are often among the first to be fired or laid off. While there is no national
 organization devoted solely to the protection of women's rights, many small, inde-
 pendent groups were active in the capital and larger cities. One of the most active,
 in particular tefore and during the elections in Apr and June, was B.a.B.e. ("Be
 Active, Be Emancipated "). This group held public discussions with political party
 representatives, debating controvesial topics of interest to women.
 Children.-The Government is strongly committed to the welfare of children.
 Schools provide free meals for children, day care facilities are available in most com-
 munities even for infants, medical care for children is free, and the Labor Code au-
 thorizes a full year of maternity leave and 3 years' leave for twins or for women
 with three or more children.
 Education is mandatory up to the age of 14; the majority of students continue to
 the age of 18, and no significant sectors or groups are excluded. Primary school edu-
 cation is compulsory, free, and universal.
 There is no societal pattern of abuse against children.
 People With Disabilities.-No legislaion mandates access to buildings or govern-
 ment services for people with disabilities; access to such facilities is often difficult.
 While people with disabilities face no open discriminatory measures, job opportuni-
 ties generally are limited. Special education is also limited and poorly funded.
 R   s   inorities.-Religion as a reflection of ethnicity was frequently used to
 identify non-Croats and as another way of singling them out for discriminatory prac-
 tices. The Muslim community suffered from discrimination, and Croatian Mus
 and Bosnian refugees continue to report widespread discriniination in many areas
 such as citizenship (see Section 2.c.) and employment rights.
 According to reliable information, religious leaders were responsible several times
 during the year for actions that retardedathe process of reconciliation. For example,
 in the area of Okucani (Western Slavonia), a Catholic priest (himself a Bosnian
 Croat refugee) was widely believed to be the instigator of much of that area's eth-
 nically motivated violence, including the burning of the Orthodox rectory building
 in the spring. Witnesses claim that the priest regularly incited the local population
 (a large nunber of whom are Bosnian Croat refugees) to commit acts of violence and
 preached a policy of revenge rather than reconciliation, at times to the discomfort
 of the indigenous Croatian population. Despite repeated efforts bythe international
 community to bring this activity to the attention of religious authorities in Zagreb,
 no action was taken to curb the priest's excesses.  m
 The close identification of reitgion with ethnicity caused religious institutions to
 be targets of violence. An orthodox priest who attempted to reconsecrate the Serbian
 Orthodox Church in Knin was threatened by a mob of ethnic Croats in January.
 A prominent Serb parliamentarian attested to harassment by the local police during
 the incident who did nothingto defuse the situation and instead further incited the
 mob. In August an Orthodox priest was attacked by an ethnic Croat mob in the
 town of Drms as he attempted to celebrate mass in the Orthodox church there, de-
 spite the presence of several uniformed police officers provided by the municipal
 government (who did nothing to restrain the crowd). The Serbian Orthodox church
 in downtown Zagreb, nevertheless, remains open, and several other Orthodox
 churches and monasteries operate freely.
 There were reported incidents of desecration in graveyards, including the deface-
 ment of a Jewish cemetery in May in Karlovac with Fascist insignia. A leading
 human rights organization also documented numerous incidents throughout the
 country of the damage and defacement of Serbian Orthodox tombstones and grave-
 yards. While one peron was arrested for the Karlovac vandalism, there were no
 publicized arrests for the other incidents.
 National /RaciallEthnic Minorities.-Constitutionally, Croatian Serbs and other
 minority groups enjoy the same protection as other self-identified ethnic and reli-
 gious groups. In practice, however, Serbs suffer severe discrimination in a wide
 number of areas. Schools with a significant number of minority students often have
 their own special curriculum in addition to standard ones, designed to teach history,
 geography, art and music to students in their native language. in practice, however,
 a pattern of ever-present and often open discrimination continues against ethnic
 Serbs and at times other minorities in such areas as the administration of justice,
 employment, housing, and freedom   of movement. The Government consistently
 
 
 1043
 maintained a double standard of treatment based on ethnicity that hindered the im-
 plementation of much of the significant progress made at high levels during the
 year in the process of the peaceful reintegration of Eastern Slavonia.
 In Septe3ber the Government adopted, despite opposition by both minority lead-
 ers and opposition parliamentarians, legislation regulating minority language edu-
 cation. The law, which Ministry of Education officials claimed incorporated all rec-
 ommendations made by the Council of Europe-except in cases when the "endan-
 gered the integrity of the republic of Croatia and the right of Croat children to be
 educated in their national language"-was deemed unduly restrictive by opponents.
 With the assistance of UNTAES, the education system in Eastern Slavonia was re-
 integrated with the rest of Croatia and a curriculum was agreed upon for Serb ma-
 jority schools in time for the 1997-98 school year. The agreement incorporated Ser-
 bian history, geography, art, nature, and society into the main Croatian curriculum
 and established that t e Serbian language would be taught during extracurricular
 hours.
 Serbs continue to be particularly vulnerable to attack because of government re-
 luctanc to protect their rights vigorously (see Sections l.a. and 1.f.). Attacks
 against property owned by Serbs continued, and the use of explosive devices and
 booby traps increased dramatically in parts of the Krajina and Western Slavonia
 particularly Okucani where there was a rash of such incidents in the spring and
 in Benkovac where there was a series of at least four bombings in late July. The
 Government maintained that, as crimes against property, these explosions were
 less serious" crimes, despite the fact that they formed part of a concerted campaign
 to discourage ethnic Serbs from returning to their homes. -Police also often denied
 that crimes were ethnically motivated, in the face of incontrovertible evidence to the
 contrary. Overall police responsiveness to complaints filed by Serb residents of the
 Krajina and Western Slavonia was often poor. For example, witnesses report that
 police participated in the riots and destruction in the area in-and around Hrvatska
 Kostajnica in May and that police were apathetic towards mob violence against a
 Serbian Orthodox priest in Drnis in August (see Section 5). The Ombudsman for
 Human Rights pointed out that police in the area around Knin and Donji Lapac
 were understaffed, with a commensurate low level of responsiveness, the first offi-
 cial acknowledgment of the problem.
 While significant progress was made on the return of people to their original
 homes throughout the country, the Government refused to adopt a welcoming atti-
 tude toward those returning ethnic Serbs who had fled Croatia in 1995 (see Section
 2.d.). Adding to the problem, displaced persons received different treatment accord-
 ing to their ethnicity. For example, the Government refused to recognize ethnic
 Serbs living in Eastern Slavonia as displaced persons, terming them instead "inter-
 nal migrants" who "left their homes of their own free will," and thus denying them
 the protected status under the- law and economic and social welfare benefits that
 the Government offered to displaced ethnic Croats. Under significant international
 pressure, the Government relented in, late spring and began to bestow limited rec-
 ognition on those Serbs who wished to return to their original homes in Croatia
 -proper. Under a mechanism developed in conjunction with the _UNHCR and
 UNTAES (the JWG), Serbs in Eastern Slavonia were encouraged, to register their
 intentions with the Government Office for Displaced Persons and Refugees (see Sec-
 tion 2.d.).
 In another positive development, the Government in the fall established a Na-
 tional Commission for Reconciliation and the Reestablishment of Trust. The Com-
 mission, chaired by a senior government official, was to oversee the creation of local
 level commissions-and develop programs aimed at bringing together estranged eth-
 nic groups. However, the.law on the temporary takeover of specified property was
 repeatedly used by local housing -commissions to deny ethnic Serbs who wished to
 return to their property. While officials claimed that the law did not technically ex-
 propriate Serb property, the effect was the same: Serbs were unable to reenter their
 homes and also found themselves unable to pursue effectively litigation in the courts
 because the law stated that the only two parties to the occupation were the current
 occupant and the Government; a Serb had no legal standing upon which to become
 a party to the case. Despite the annulment of portions of the law in September by
 the Constitutional Court, the main points remained unchanged through the year.
 Serbs and other minorities also suffered from economic discrimination. Unemploy-
 ment among ethnic Serbs was markedly higher than the 16.5 percent reported by
 the Government as the national average, and a disproportionate number of layoffs
 and firings involve ethnic Serbs. Unemployment in the formerly occupied areas is
 much higher, where international organizations estimated that as much as 80 to 90
 percent of the population is unemployed. Under UNTAES supervision, work con-
 tracts were signed between Serbs living in the region and the Government. Under
 
 
 1044
 these contracts, the Government was obligated to integrate these Serb employees
 into state institutions and enterprises in the course of reintegration.
 The Law on Citizenship distinguishes between those who have a claim to Croatian
 ethnicity and those who do not. The "Croatian people" are eligible to become citizens
 of Croatia, even if they were not citizens of the former Socialist Republic of Croatia,
 as long as they submit a written statement that they consider themselves Croatian
 citizens. Others must satisfy more stringent requirements through naturalization in
 order to obtain citizenship, even if they were previously lawful residents of Croatia
 as citizens of the former Yugoslavia. While an application is pending, the applicant
 is denied rights such as social allowances, including medical care, pensions, free
 education, and employment in the civil service.
 Human rights groups complained that the Interior Ministry frequently based de-
 nials on Article 26 of the citizenship law (which permits it to deny citizenship to
 persons otherwise qualified for reasons of national interest) and on Article 8 (which
 includes a requirement that persons' actions demonstrate that they are "attached
 to the legal system and customs of Croatia"). Both of these articles were often sub-
 jectively applied, with little or no documentation to back up the denials (see Section
 .e.). The citizenship status of many Muslims in the area around Slunj has not yet
 been remedied, and in some cases entire villages remain stateless.
 This double standard for citizenship was c early demonstrated during the presi-
 dential elections when ethnic Croats in Bosnia and Herzegovina (all of whom qualify
 for Croatian citizenship under the law) were allowed to vote; however, Croatian
 Serbs who fled Croatia in 1995, but who otherwise lived their entire lives in Croatia,
 were denied the ability both to apply for and receive their citizenship as well as the
 right to vote, effectively disenfranchising several hundred thousand ethnic Serbs.
 The situation for other minority groups-Slovaks, Czechs, Italians and Hungar-
 ians-did not reflect significant discrimination to the same extent as the Serb com-
 munity. Roma continued to face societal discrimination and official inaction when
 complaints were filed. However, public awareness of the difficulties that Roma face
 in society was raised by several public forums, including round table and panel dis-
 cussions with government and civic leaders.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-All workers are entitled to form or join unions of
 their own choosing without prior authorization. There is an active labor movement
 with three major and three minor national labor federations and independent asso-
 ciations of both blue- and white-collar members. More than 80 percent of workers
 are members of unions of one type or another. In general unions are independent
 of the Government and political parties. However, during the year unions claimed
 that in several instances workers were pressured by their employers to join particu-
 lar unions or subsidiaries, deemed by the employer to be more friendly to the ruling
 HDZ party.
 The law prohibits retaliation against strikers participating in legal strikes. Work-
 ers may only strike at the end of a contract or in specific circumstances mentioned
 in the contract. Most importantly, the Supreme Court has ruled that workers may
 not strike for nonpayment of wages, which continues to be a serious problem. The
 only recourse in the event of nonpayment is to go to court, a process that may take
 several years. If a strike is found to be illegal, any participant can be dismissed and
 the union held liable for damages.
 In 1996 the Ministry of Labor and Social Welfare refused to register the Pension-
 ers' Trade Union as an association under Article 159 of the Labor Code, which
 states that only employed workers may be members of a trade union. This narrow
 interpretation of the labor law may also affect the temporarily unemployed and stu-
 dents in vocational training as well. While the case was appealed to the administra-
 tive court in 1996, there has as yet been no resolution. Union leaders speculated
 that by not registering the pensioners trade union, the Government hoped to dis-
 courage a repetitions of the large demonstrations organized by pensioners in 1996,
 protesting the low level and late payment of pensions.
 When negotiating a new contract, workers are required to go through mediation
 before they can strike. Labor and management chose the mediator together. If they
 cannot agree, the labor law calls for a tripartite commission of labor, business, and
 government representatives to appoint one. However, the establishment of the tri-
 partite commission was delayed for almost 18 months and was only successfully in-
 augurated in June. This delay had adverse~effects on the ability of unions to resolve
 disputes with management and the distribution of commonly held union property,
 as called for by the Government. Arbitration is never mandatory, but can be used
 if both sides agree. Only after submitting to mediation and formally filing a state-
 ment that negotiations are at an impasse is a strike legal.
 
 
 1045
 The right to strike is provided for in the Constitution with these limitations and
 with additional limits on members of the armed forces, police, government adminis-
 tration, and public-services. Even though salaries are very low relative to the cost
 of living, there is little strike activity. Despite the removal on January 1 of a govern-
 ment-imposed public sector wage. freeze (which affected 55 percent of the work
 force), overall wage increases have been minimal. The stringent requirements for
 calling a strike, the high rate of unemployment, and the Government's insistence
 on adhering to its austerity program of 1993 all discourage strikes. There was one
 significant strike during the year, in which several thousand railway workers, who
 went on, strike late in 1996, again walked off the job in January (see Section 6.b.).
 In April 2,000 textile workers organized a mass demonstration in Zagreb to demand
 collective negotiations with the Government and the development of a long-term
 strategy for the industry.
 Unions may freely afiliate internationally.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Collective bargaining is pro-
 tected by law and practiced freely. -The Labor Code governs collective bargaining
 contracts, protection for striking workers, and legal limitations on the ability of em-
 ployers to conduct "lockouts" during labor disputes. The process of "transforming"
 previously "socially owned" enterprises continues, albeit slowly, as the first step to-
 wards their eventual privatization. The privatization process, however, was widely
 criticized as neither transparent nor fair, with a large umber of the best enterprises
 thus far on the market being sold to those with close connections to the regime. The
 transition to privat enterprise and a free market economy has kept labor unions
 under pressure at the same time that they are making progress towards establish-
 ing themselves as genuine trade unions, representative of their members rather
 than the Government. General unemployment is the most significdnt hurdle. Unem-
 ployment rose during the year, with government sources claiming that the unem-
 ployment rate was 16.6 percent in June. Unions and international organizations
 pointed out however, that this figure .does not include the substantial "gray- econ-
 omy and workers who do not register as unemployed. International observers and
 unions estimate that the actual figure could be as high as 25 to 30 percent, with
 reliable international organizations estimating that that figure jumps to 80 to 90
 percent in the former occupied areas of the country, where the economy is virtually
 at a standstill. As of June, approximately 12 percent of workers did not receive their
 salaries on time. When salary payments are not made, payments into the social wel-
 fare system also lag, thereby denying workers health coverage.
 The Labor Code deals directly with antiunion discrimination issues. It expressly
 allows unions to challenge firings in court, and unions report that the number of
 such legal cases has been increasing. There are continuing reports that ethnicity is
 used as a grounds for dismissal. For example, in the spring, two ethnic Serb women
 were dismissed from their jobs, allegedly for expressing undue sympathy by com-
 memorating the fall of the Croatian city of Vukovar during the war (the two women
 had flowers on their desks, something they did regularly, not oniy on significant
 days). The court system, however, is a ready seriously overburdened, and cases can
 languish for many months or years before they are resolved (see Section 1.d.). The
 Government frequently employs coercion against employees, including government
 employees, involved in labor disputes and strikes to force the employees back to
 work. This occurred during the railroad strike that occurred from December 1996
 to January 1997. During this action, workers and strike organizers were threatened
 with dismissal and, in a few cases, with bodily harm unless they signed a paper
 that stated that they did not support the strike. During the same strike, there was
 at least one attempt at bribery to coerce workers back on the job and 22 organizers
 of the strike were found responsible in court for damages to be paid to the railroad
 company when the first of the multipart strike was declared illegal.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced or compulsory labor is con-
 stitutionally forbidden, and there were no documented instances of it. While legisla-
 tion does not explicitly cover children, the constitutional ban provides blanket cov-
 erage in this area, and the Government enforces this prohibition effectively. The
 Ministry of Labor and Social Welfare is the agency charged with enforcing the ban
 on coerced or forced labor.
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment.-The mini-
 mum age for the employment of children is 15 years of age, and it is enforced by
 the Ministry of Labor and Social Welfare. Under the Constitution, whose provisions
 the Government enforces, children may not be employed before reaching the legally
 determined age, may not perform forced or bonded labor, and are not allowed to per-
 form work that is harmful to their health or morality (see Section 6.c.). There is no
 known pattern of abuse of child labor. Workers under the age of 18 are entitled to
 
 
 1046
 special protection at work and are prohibited from heavy manual labor and night
 shifts. Education is mandatory up to the age of 14.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-While there is no standard minimum wage, the
 government fund for retirement and disability insurance establishes a minimum sal-
 ary, as of December ap roximately $165 (1,024 kuna), upon which employers must
 pay taxes for each of tiheir workers. There is however, no requirement that the
 worker actually receives the minimum base salary. The government bureau of sta-
 tistics estimated that the average net monthly wage was approximately $460 (2,437
 kuna) as of October, which labor unions estimated was only half of the amount nec-
 essary to provide for a family of four. There are national minimum wage standards
 that are enforced by the Ministry of Labor and Social Welfare. The minimum gross
 monthly wage was approximately $150 (900 Kuna) as of September, which does not
 provide a decent standard of living for a worker and family. Government policy to-
 ward its employees is a major factor in setting wage standards. There is a large
 public sector and the Government manages through the privatization fund, employ-
 ees of companies waiting to be privatized. In January the Government removedthe
 1996 wage freeze imposed on public sector workers, in order to rectify the large dis-
 parity between public and private sector wages. However, despite removing the re-
 moval of the wage freeze, public sector workers have received only nominal wage
 increases.
 National regulations provide for a 42-hour workweek with a  2-hour daily break,
 a 24-hour rest period during the week, and a minimum of 18 days of paid vacation
 annually. Workers receive time-and-a-half pay for any hours worked over 42.
 Health and safety standards are set by the Government and are enforced by the
 Ministry of Health. In practice industries are not diligent in meeting standards for
 worker protection: It is common to find workers without hard hats at construction
 sites and equipment with safety devices removed. Workers can, in theory, remove
 themselves from hazardous conditions at work. A worker would have recourse to the
 courts in a situation where he felt that he had been wrongfully dismissed for doing
 SO.
