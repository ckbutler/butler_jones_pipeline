 COLOMBIA
 Colombia is a constitutional, multiparty democracy, in which the Liberal and Con-
 servative parties have long dominated politics. In May and June elections, citizens
 chose Conservative Party candidate Andres Pastrana as President, and he took of-
 fice on August 7. The Liberal Party maintained control of the national bicameral
 legislature following elections on March 8. Despite attempts at intimidation and
 fraud by paramilitary groups, guenillas, and narcotics traffickers, all three elections
 were generally free, fair, and transparent, with high voter turnout. The civil judici-
 ary is largely independent of government influence, although the suborning or in-
 timidation of judges, witnesses, and prosecutors by those indicted is common.
 The Government continued to face a serious challenge to its control over the na-
 tional territory, as longstanding and widespread internal armed conflict and ramp-
 ant violence--both criminal and political-persisted. The principal participants were
 government security forces, paramilitary groups, guerrillas, and narcotics traffick-
 ers. In some areas government forces were engaged in combat with guerrillas or
 narcotics traffickers, while in others paramilitary groups fought guerrillas, and in
 still others guerrillas baffled demobilized members of rival guerrilla factions. Para-
 military groups and-to a lesser extent--guerrillas attacked unarmed civillans sus-
 pected of loyalty to an opposing party in the conflict. The two major guerrilla
 groups, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) and the National Lib-
 eration Army (ELN), consist of an estimated 11,000 to 17,000 full-time combatants
 organized into more than 100 semiautonomous groups. The FARC and the ELN,
 along with other smaller groups, exercised a significant degree of influence and ini-
 tiated armed action in nearly 700 of the country's 1,073 municipalities during the
 year, roughly comparable to their level of activity in 1997. The major guerrilla orga-
 nizations received a significant part of their revenues (in the hundreds of millions
 of dollars) from fees levied on narcotics production and trafficking. Guerrlas sup-
 planted absent state institutions in many sparsely populated areas of the national
 territory. On July 9, President-elect Pastrana undertook peace efforts in a meeting
 with FARC leader "Manuel Marulanda Velez, which followed a meeting between
 civil society groups and the ELN in Mainz, Germany, on June 28. A second round
 of ELN-civil society talks held in Colombia on October 12 yielded plans for a na-
 tional convention in 1999 to discuss political solutions to the conflict. In a
 prenegotiation concession to the FARC, the Government committed to withdraw its
 military forces from five southern municipalities on November 7 for a 90-day period.

 At year's end, the Government and the FARC had agreed to begin holding peace
 talks in January 1999.
 The civilian-led Ministry of Defense is responsible for internal security and over-
 sees both the armed forces and the National Police, although civilian management
 of the armed forces is limited. The Administrative Department of Security (DAS),
 with broad intelligence gathering, law enforcement, and investigative authority, re-
 ports directly to the President, but is directed by a law enforcement professional.
 The police are charged formally with maintaining internal order and security, but
 in practice law enforcement responsibilities often were shared with the army, espe-
 cially in rural areas. In some locations on a few occasions the army attacked and
 captured members of illegal paramilitary groups; in others members of the security
 forces collaborated with such groups, and several general officers were under inves-
 tigation during the year for arming and sharing intelligence with such groups. Al-
 though their record showed some improvement, the armed forces and the police
 committed numerous, serious violations of human rights throughout the year.
 Despite years of drug- and politically-related violence, the economy is diverse and
 developed. Trade and financial activity have been liberalized, and many public-sec-
 tor entities privatized, since 1991. Crude oil, coffee, coal, and cut flowers are the
 principal legal exports. Narcotics traffickers continued to control large tracts of land
 and other assets and exerted influence throughout society and political life. Gross
 domestic product (GDP) growth has slowed in recent years, and the 1998 growth
 rate of 2 percent was one of the lowest ever. To defend the peso, the Central Bank
 raised interest rates drastically early in the year. The result was a recessionary cli-
 mate and record unemployment rates (nearly 16 percent) in the last half of the year.
 Inflation ended the year below 17 percent, a 15-year low. The balance of payments
 and fiscal deficits both rose to critical levels. Income distribution is highly skewed;
 much of the population lives in poverty. Per capita GDP was about $2,500. Some
 academic observers estimated that the various armed conflicts cost the country as
 much as 3 percent in GDP growth annually.
 The Government's human rights record remained poor; there was some improve-
 ment in several areas, but serious problems remain. Government forces continued
 to commit numerous, serious abuses, including extrajudicial killings, but at a level
 below that of previous years. The authorities rarely brought officers of the security
 forces and the police charged with human rights offenses to justice. In May the
 army formally disbanded the 20th Brigade (military intelligence), which had an
 egreV'ous human rights record, including targeted killings of civilians, and prohib-
 ited its successor organization from directly undertaking armed operations. Security
 forces were responsible for one known instance of forced disappearance and several
 instances of torture; police and soldiers continued to beat detainees. At times the
 security forces collaborated with paramilitary groups that committed abuses. Condi-
 tions in the overcrowded prisons are generally harsh; however, some inmates use
 bribes or intimidation to obtain more favorable treatment. Arbitrary arrest and de-
 tention, as well as prolonged pretrial detention, are fundamental problems. The ci-
 vilian judiciary is inefficient, severely overburdened by a large case backlog, and un-
 dermined by intimidation and the prevailing climate of impunity. This situation re-
 mains at the core of the country's human rights problems. Less than 3 percent of
 all crimes committed nationwide are prsecuted successfully. The use of "faceless"
 prosecutors, judges, and witnesses, under cover of anonymity for security reasons,
 continued in cases involving kidnaping, extortion, narcotics trafficking, terrorism,
 and in several hundred high-profile cases involving human rights violations. Human
 rights groups accuse these courts of violating fdamental rights of due process, in-
 cluding the right to a public trial. The authorities sometimes infringed on citizens'
 rivayrihts. Journalists practiced self-censorshi. Elements of the security forces
 arassed and threatened human rights groups. Violence agst women and chil-
 dren is a serious problem, as is child prostitution. Extensive societal discrimination
 against women, minorities, and the indigenous continued. Child labor is a wide-
 spread problem. Vigilante and paramilitary groups that engaged in "social cleans-
 ing-the killing of street children, prostitutes, homosexuals, and others deemed so-
 cially undesirable-continued to be a serious problem.
 Throughout the country, paramilitary groups murdered, tortured, and threatened
 civilians suspected of sympathizing with guerrillas in an orchestrated campaign to
 terrorize them into fleeing their homes, thereby depriving guerrillas of civilian sup-
 port. A paramilitary umbrella organization, whose membership totaled approxi-
 mately 5,000 to 7,000 armed combatants, exercised increasing influence during the
 year, extending its presence into areas previously under guerrilla control. Although
 some paramilitary groups reflect rural residents' desire to organize solely for self-
 defense, others are vigilante organizations, and still others are actually the paid pri-
 vate armies of narcotics traffickers or large landowners. The army's record in deal-
 
 
 547
 ing with paramilitary groups remained mixed. In some locations the army attacked
 and captured members of such groups; in others it tolerated or even collaborated
 with paramilitary groups.
 The FARC and the ELN regularly attacked civilian populations, committed mas-
 sacres, and held more than 1,000 kidnaped civilians, with ransom payments serving
 as an important source of revenue. In some places, guerrillas collected "war taxes,'
 pressed the citizenry into their ranks, forced small farmers to sow illicit crops, and
 regulated travel, commerce, and other activities.
 The cycle of violence involving government forces, paramilitary groups, and guer-
 rillas resulted in the deaths of 2,000 to 3,000 persons; according to one nongovern-
 mental organization, during the first 9 months of the year in cases in which the per-
 petrator was identified credibly, government forces committed at least 21
 extrajudicial killings in the context of the internal conflict and in other actions,
 paramilitary groups committed at least 573, and guerrillas at least 160. Violence
 and instability in rural areas displaced 300,000 civilians from their homes during
 the year, more than any other similar period during the past decade. The total num-
 ber of internally displaced citizens during 1995-98 probably exceeded 750,000.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-Political and extrajudicial killings
 continued to be a serious problem. An estimated 2,000 to 3,000 citizens died in such
 acts, committed principally by nonstate agents. Members of the security forces con-
 tinued to commit extrajudicial killings, but at a substantially reduced rate. The Cen-
 ter for Investigations and Popular Research (CINEP), a nongovernmental organiza-
 tion (NGO), reported that the security forces were responsible for 21 extrajudicial
 killings in which the perpetrators could be identified during the first 9 months of
 the year. This represented a decrease from 1997, when the military and police were
 deemed responsible for killing 86 persons, and from 1996, when the total was 126.
 The police reportedly committed some social cleansing killings, and CINEP reported
 two killings resulting from police abuse of authority. ,
 The human rights delegate of the Attorney General's office processed 467 cases
 during 1998. It concluded investigations for alleged infractions committed in pre-
 vious years by 173 members of the security forces, a majority of whom were officers.
 The office exonerated the accused person in 72 cases, and imposed administrative
 sanctions, (e.g., fines, temporary suspensions, dismissals) in the other 99 cases. (The
 remaining two subjects died during the course of the investigations.) Of the 173 se-
 curity force members investigated i criminal activity, 77 were members of the army
 and 71 were members of the national police. Cases were found to be either without
 merit or "archived" for lack of sufficient evidence in 294 instances. The most com-
 monly cited offense was torture, followed by massacres, homicides, forced disappear-
 ances, and arbitrary detentions. It remains unclear how many of the 99 persons who
 received administrative sanctions were subsequently referred to the Prosecutor Gen-
 eral for criminal prosecution, or how many of these administrative sanctions were
 the result of previous criminal investigations.
 During the year, the human rights unit of the Prosecutor General's office pursued
 65 criminal processes against members of the security forces and civilian officials,
 77 processes against paramilitaries, 25 processes against guerrillas, and 33 proc-
 esses against private civilians. In total, it issued 276 arrest warrants during the
 year, on the basis of which the authorities arrested 60 persons. Among the 74 mili-
 tary personnel against whom it took action for alleged serious human rights abuses
 were 1 brigadier general, 7 colonels, 8 majors, 5 captains, and 2 lieutenants.
 The National Institute for Forensic Medicine stated in a preliminary report that
 at least 19,665 murders occurred during the year. In 1997 the Institute reported a
 final homicide rate of 60 deaths per 100,000 inhabitants. The police and the Pros-
 ecutor General's office have insufficient resources to investigate most killings ade-
 quately. In 1996 the Superior Council of the Judiciary reported that 74 percent of
 all crimes go unreported, and between 97 and 98 percent of all crimes go
 unpunished. The 1996 Government Commission on Public Spending placed the im-
 punity rate for all crimes at 99.5 percent.
 According to CINEP, on July 24, soldiers of the Boca battalion of the army's Third
 Brigade executed 5 civilians whom they suspected of being members of the FARC's
 58th front at a road block at San Pablo municipality, Narino department. The bod-
 ies of Mario Burgos Arcos, Carlos Betancur Garcia, Martin Estacio Ceballo, Carlos
 Obando Cabrera, and Jose Calderon Riascos reportedly showed signs of torture. Ac-
 cording to the Ministry of Defense, the military judiciary was investigating the inci-
 dent at year's end.
 
 
 I In May the army formally disbanded the 20th Brigade (military intelligence),
 which had an egregious human rights record including the targeted killing of civil-
 ians. In an effort to ensure that the brigade's successor organization, the Army Mili-
 tary Intelligence Center (CIME), would not commit human rights abuses, the army
 prohibited it from directly undertaking armed operations. On October 16, the Pros-
 ecutor General's office ordered the arrest of retired Colonel Bernardo Ruiz Silva, the
 commander of the 20th Brigade in 1995, in connection with the November 1995 Bo-
 gota assassination of conservative opposition leader Alvaro Gomez Hurtado and his
 assistant. However, at year's end, Col. Ruiz remained a fugitive.
 In August a civilian court sentenced seven of the Departmental Investigative Po-
 lice at Palmira, Valle del Cauca to a collective total of 250 years' imprisonment for
 the February 1996 torture and murders of soldiers Edison Echeverri Vergar and
 Jorge Eliecer Lopez, and mechanic Gustavo Diaz, whom they had suspected of being
 guerrillas. (One policeman was exonerated and another was freed conditionally.)
 Four policemen in custody received 27 years' imprisonment; three who were fugi-
 tives from justice at year's end received 54 years' each. In 1997 a military court had
 convicted all seven of charges of deprivation of liberty (kidnaping), abandoning the
 service, and attempted robbery. The National Police had removed all seven police-
 men from duty prior to their sentencing.
 In September a military tribunal exonerated five policemen of the September 1995
 death of Italian tourist Giacomo Turra in a Cartagenapolice station. Although the
 olicemen claimed that Turra had died of a drug and alcohol overdose, an autopsy
 ythe National Institute of Forensic Medicine determined that he was beaten to
 death. The Supreme Military Tribunal was considering an appeal of the case at
 year's end.
 The military judiciary convicted 76 security force members, including 3 police offi-
 cers and 1 army officer, during the year, including some for human rights violations.
 Those courts convicted 29 of homicide, 41 of assault, 4 of deprivation of liberty, 1
 of abuse of authority, and 1 of rape. However, the Ministry of Defense reported nei-
 ther the nature of sentences in the 76 cases nor the circumstances of the crimes.
 The civilian Prosecutor General's office pursued cases against 74 security force
 members for human rights crimes during the year, including 22 army officers and
 2 marine officers. The Penal Code authorizes restriction to base as an acceptable
 substitute for imprisonment when military jails or prisons are unavailable.
 In an October 13 ruling, the Attorney General's office "severely reprimanded" four
 officers and one noncommissioned officer (marine Lieutenant Colonel Rodrigo Al-
 fonso Quinonez, marine Major Jairo Osorio Morales, army Majors Walter Hurtado
 Morales and Jose Fernando Lee Uribe, and marine Third Sergeant Carlos Lopez
 Maquillon) for their roles in establishing, promoting, fimancing, and fomenting para-
 military groups, and for assisting members of these groups in entering the city of
 Barrancabermeja for the purpose of committing murder during 1993-94. The activi-
 ties of these groups caused the deaths of at least 50 persons. Nonetheless, all five
 remained in uniform and on active duty at year's end. The Superior Military Tribu-
 nal earlier had exonerated a lieutenant colonel of similar charges involving the
 1993-94 Barrancabermeja massacres.
 In May the Attorney General's office ordered the army to separate Lieutenant
 Colonel Luis Felipe Becerra Bohorquez from service because of his role in the Octo-
 ber 1993 "Rio Frio" massacre; however, the Attorney General's office reduced the
 punishment in October to issuance of a severe reprimand, because complicity in a
 massacre had not yet been codified as a crime at the time of the massacre. (A light
 punishment, the severe reprimand is noted in the security force member's personnel
 file and can affect his chances for promotion.) On October 14, Third Brigade com-
 mander Jaime Canal concluded military tribunal proceedings against Becerra and
 two other army members, and found the three guilty of a coverup of the Rio Frio
 massacre. Becerra was tried and convicted in absentia. The tribunal sentenced
 Becerra to 12 months' im risonment, although he remained in hiding at year's end.
 The court also sentence Major Eduardo Delgado Carrillo and Second Sergeant
 Leopoldo Moreno Rincon to 9 and 7 months' imprisonment, respectively. They were
 restricted to their bases at year's end.
 In July just before leaving office, President Samper publicly and formally recog-
 nized state responsibility for the deaths of some 50 citizens in 3 massacres and 2
 extrajudicial killings that occurred during 1991-93 (and under a previous presi-
 dent). Despite the President's statement, military courts had already absolved those
 army and police personnel investigated of any responsibility for the killings; how-
 ever, civilian courts had convicted several low-ranking soldiers and a few civilians
 for these crimes. Samper's statement was part of an amicable settlement under the
 auspices of the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR); the Govern-
 ment also fired three police officers implicated in one case and initiated payment
 
 
 549
 of compensation to the families of some of the victims. In July an anonymous re-
 gional court sentenced 3 civilians to 30-year prison terms and fined an army cor-
 poral and 2 civilian informants for their roles in the April 1991 massacre by the
 army of 15 bus passengers and 2 passersby at Los Uvos. The military judicial sys-
 tem still is processing the cases of two army majors implicated in the investigation.
 The other 4 cases for which President Samper accepted state responsibility are
 the December 1991 massacre of 20 Paez Indians by the police at Caloto, Cauca; the
 November 1992 killing of 10 persons in Medellin's Villatina neighborhood by police
 officers; the April 1992 murders Faride Herrera and Oscar Ivan Andrade by mem-
 bers of the army and the police; and the June 1993 killing of a youth, Roison Mora
 Rubiano, by members of the army.
 On March 31, an anonymous civil court judge sentenced five police and army offi-
 .cers (including army Lieutenant Colonel Alejandro Londono Tomayo, then in com-
 mand of the Bombona battalion of the 14th brigade, and Lieutenant Colonel Marco
 Baez Garzon), to 18 years' imprisonment. The officers had been charged with terror-
 ism and complicity in the November 1988 paramilitary massacre of a group of 49
 people and the injury of 56 others at Segovia, Antioquia department. On December
 22, in a separate military trial, the Superior Military Tribunal exonerated the 5 offi-
 cers, a well as 3 others, of related charges also stemming from the Segovia mas-
 sacre. Despite his civilian court conviction, Londono was never detained and re-
 mained on active duty at the end of the year with the army's logistical support bri-
 gade in Bogota. While it was asserted that Londono was entitled to continue on ac-
 tive duty status because the civilian judiciary had yet to rule on his appeal, Londono
 should have been in preventive detention, stripped of his uniform and removed from
 active military service, accordingto both the Prosecutor General's office and the De-
 fense Ministry's own human rights office. After his conviction and sentencing, Baez
 Garzon also remained on active duty with the army's Third Brigade in Call How-
 ever, in September he was relieved of his responsibilities as deputy brigade com-
 mander, placed on half pay, and restricted to the Third Brigade's base. He remained
 in uniform while appealing his conviction, even while a warrant for his arrest by
 civilian authorities remained outstanding.
 In June authorities arrested marine Colonel Jose Ancizar Molano Padilla, then-
 commander of the 2nd marine Infantry Battalion, and marine Sergeants Javier Fer-
 nando Guerra, Eduardo Aristides Alvarez, and Jorge Milton Caicedo for the May
 1995 social cleansing murders of two alleged thieves, Sifredy and Freddy Arboleda.
 Prosecutor General's office investigators found the two bodies and those of other vic-
 tims in the garbage dump of that battalion at Tumaco, Narmno. Molano and the
 three sergeants were in detention and undergoing civilian judicial processing at
 year's end.
 In June the appellate court of the military judicial system confirmed the June
 1997 decision by then-commanding general of the army General Manuel Jose Bonett
 to exonerate retired General Yanine Diaz of all charges related to formation and ac-
 tivities of paramilitary groups. Yanine Diaz, the highest-ranking military officer
 ever detained on human rights charges, was first ordered to be arrested in 1996 by
 the Prosecutor General on various charges, including several related to the 1987
 massacre of 19 local merchants in the Magdalena Medio region. Long suspected of
 being a patron of paramilitary groups, Yanine Diaz was accused of implementing
 a strategy to have paramilitary groups carry out counterguerrilla activities that the
 army was prohibited from doing in the Magdalena Medio region in the 1980's. De-
 spite the GovernmenVs attempts to bring him to justice in the civilian court system,
 the military prevailed, continuing the tradition of impunity for all but the lowest-
 ranking members of the security forces. A complaint against Yanine Diaz remained
 before the IACHR at year's end.
 Credible allegations of cooperation with paramilitary groups, including instances
 of-both silent support and direct collaboration by members of the armed forces, in
 particular the army, continued. There were tacit arrangements between local mili-
 tary commanders and paramilitary groups in some regions, and paramilitary groups
 operated freely in some areas that were under military control. The authorities as-
 signed two senior officers with links to paramilitary groups to top leadership posi-
 tions: Brigadier General Rit Alejo del Rio Rojas and Brigadier General Fernando
 Milan Perez. However, the new military high command, appointed by President
 Pastrana and under the leadership of General Fernando Tapias, stated repeatedly
 that it would not tolerate collaboration between military personnel and paramilitary
 groups.
 he authorities arrested five persons, including two army sergeants, for their
 roles in the July 15-20, 1997 massacre in the town of Mapiripan, Meta department.
 During the attack, paramilitary members had singled out at least seven persons in
 the town and executed them, reportedly for supporting the guerrillas. An estimated
 
 
 2,000 persons subsequently fled from the town, claiming that the paramilitary forces
 had killed as many as two dozen others and thrown their bodies into the Guaviare
 River. In a September 1997 interview in El Tiempo newspaper, paramilitary leader
 Carlos Castano, head of the Self-Defense Forces of Cordoba and Uraba (ACCU), ad-
 mitted responsibility for the Mapiripan massacre. In June the National Police ar-
 rested suspected Meta department paramilitary leader Rene Cardenas Galeano for
 his part in org  ng the attack. On July 10, the police arrested army sergeants
 Juan Caos Gamarra and Jose Miller Uruena, of the Seventh Brigade's Joaquin
 Paris Battalion and p laced them in military detention on suspicion of having facili-
 tated the attack. In September the police arrested two private pilots for transporting
 the perpetrators of the attack to a nearby airfield. Prosecution of all five was under-
 way at year's end.
 The Attorney General's office was investigating then-commander of the army's
 Seventh Brigade, Brigadier General Jaime Humberto Uscategui, army Major
 Hernan Orozco Castro, army Captain Juan Carlos Lopez, and five local Mapiripan
 civilian officials for complicity in the Mapiripan massacre. The Attorney General's
 office was forced to close its investigation of Brigadier General Agustin Ardila Uribe,
 then commander of the Fourth Division, when Ardila retired in 1997. The office may
 investigate only active duty personnel. The army reportedly had opened its own in-
 vestigation into the Mapiripan attack, but no developments had been announced by
 year's end. No arrests were made for a similar paramilitary incursion into
 Mirafiores, Guaviare, on October 18-20, 1997, which left at least five persons dead.
 In August the Prosecutor General for human rights opened a formal investigation
 of the army's Fifth Brigade commander, Brigadier General Fernando Millan Perez,
 to look into allegations that Milan armed and equipped a paramilitary group in
 Lebrija, Santander department in 1997. The group was believed responsible for at
 least 11 murders. However, on October 1 the Superior Judicial Council determined
 that Milan's alleged actions constituted an "act of service," and turned the case over
 to the military judiciary for prosecution, effectively cutting off the prosecutor's inves-
 tigation. Millan had denied the charges. Thirteenth Brigade commander Brigadier
 General Rito Alejo del Rio Rojas voluntarily made a formal statement to the Pros-
 ecutor General's office in August to respond to allegations that he had encouraged
 the formation of, and active collaboration with, paramilitary groups in the Uraba
 region. Brigadier General del Rio denied the charges, and in December the Prosecu-
 tor General's office dropped all charges against him for lack of evidence.
 There was no progress in the case against army Captain Rodrigo Flores, who was
 arrested in Ma y 1997 for a 1996 massacre in Segovia, Antioquia department, or in
 the case against former army Captai n Ciro Alfonso Vargas Lancheros for his pos-
 sibl e mliin the April 1996 murder of three men in Ciudad Bolivar, Medellin. In
 October 1997 the Prosecuting Attorney's Human Rights Unit formally charged two
 army Sergeants, Hernando Metina Camacho and Gusto Gil Zuniga Labrdo    and
 paramilitary leader Carlos Castano with the 1994 killing of the leader of Patriotic
 Union (UP) Senator Manuel Vargas Cepeda. The two sergeants remained in preven-
 tive detention, while Castano was tried in absentia. The case was awaiting a judge's
 decision at year's end.
 In 1997 the national human rights Ombudsman received 192 complaints against
 members of paramilitary groups involving killings. It also received 82 complaints
 against paramilitary groupstof massacres. CINEP reported that paramilitary groups
 were responsible for 573 extrajudicial killings.
 On May 4, more than 200 paramilitary members entered the town of Puerto
 Alvira, Mete department, and murdered between 12 and 22 local residents whom
 they suspected of being guerrilla sympathizers or collaborators. A definitive death
 toll was not available, as-the bodies were disposed of in  a nearby river. The
 attackers also destroyed much of the town's infrastructure. At the insistence of the
 attackers, hundreds of persons subsequently fled from the town. Some of the
 attackers allegedly identified themselves to town residents as the perpetrators of the
 1997 massacre at Mapiripan. ACCU leader Carlos Castano publiciy had declared
 Puerto Alvira a military objective in September 1997. The human rights Ombuds-
 man criticized the Government for not heeding his January call for protection of the
 town. The Defense Minister subsequently responded that not enough troops had
 been available for permanent deployment to protect all threatened towns. A prelimi-
 nary investigation by the Prosecutor General's office was underway at year's end,
 but no developments were reported.
 On May 16, 40 to 50 heavily armed members of the AUSAC paramilitary organi-
 zation entered the town of Barrancabermeja, Santander department, and rounded
 up young adults whom they suspected of sympathizing with the ELN. They killed
 11 persons and dumped their bodies in the streets, and kidnaped another 25 per-
 sons. On June 3, a court convicted two detained Santander department former may-
 
 
 ors, who had been arrested in 1992, of complicity in paramilitary violence. Possibly
 in retaliation for these convictions, the paramilitary group announced on June 4
 that the 25 hostages had been "tried" as guerrilla supporters, "convicted," executed,
 and their bodies burned. The Samper Government established an ad hoc Truth
 Commission to investigate the massacre; it presented a basic report on July 31,
 which noted that both the Attorney General and the Prosecutor General's office
 were investigating the massacre. Those investigations were still under way at year's
 end. The Prosecutor General's office was investigating 10 army and police members
 for complicity in the attack at year's end, and I of the ten, army Corporal Rodrigo
 Perez Perez, had been detained on suspicion of having participated directly in the
 attack. Politically  motivated  killings  and  related  unrest  continued  in
 Barrancabermeja at a very high rate throughout the year. AUSAC paramilitary
 leader Guillermo Cristancho Acosta, who publicly admitted having ordered the
 killings, had not been detained at year's end.
 Paramilitary groups continued to target and kill judicial and criminal investiga-
 tive employees for their efforts to enforce the rule of law. On June 10, Sergio Parra
 Ossa, Medellin chief of the Prosecutor General's corps of technical investigators, was
 shot to death; members of paramilitary groups were the principal suspects. The bod-
 ies of technical investigators Edilbrando Roa Lopez and John Morales Patino were
 found at Mesopotania, Antioquia department on September 3. The two had been in-
 vestigating a massacre of nine persons at the nearby town of Sonson; the unidenti-
 fied perpetrators of the Sonson massacre likely killed Roa and Morales. The mur-
 ders of Roa and Morales brought the number of killings of Prosecutor General's of-
 fice employees during the last 2 years to 30; in the Medellin office alone 7 were
 killed between January and June.
 On February 24, police and prosecutors arrested billionaire emerald magnate Vic-
 tor Carranza in Bogota on charges of sponsoring the Eastern Plains paramilitary
 self-defense group. Despite his efforts to subvert the workings of the judiciary
 through bribery and political influence, Carranza remained in jail at year's end.
 While an estimated 400 paramilitary members were believed to be in jail at year's
 end, known paramilitary leaders largely remained beyond the reach of the law. On
 May 21, 19 paramilitary followers of Victor Carranza escaped from Bogota's maxi-
 mum security prison. The reported finance chief for the ACCU paramilitary group,
 Jacinto Alberto Soto Tor, escaped from jail several months afer his capture in
 Antioquia.
 There continued to be incidents of social cleansing-including attacks and
 killings-directed against individuals deemed socially undesirable, such as drug ad-
 dicts, prostitutes, transvestites, beggars, and street children. According to the Na-
 tional Institute for Forensic Medicine, such killings occurred with greatest frequency
 in Bogota, and the departments of Magdalena and Antioquia. Most of these inci-
 dents were attributed to police or paramilitary groups. CINEP attributed 2 social
 cleansing murders and one injury to police; other cases were not reported.
 Paramilitary groups also killed members of indigenous-groups(see Section 5) and
 labor leaders (see Section 6).
 On November 7, the authorities found the skeletons of 25 children in a common
 grave near Pereira, Risaralda department. Forensics experts concluded that the chil-
 en had been murdered. Some observers speculated that the killings may have
 been the result of a social cleansing campaign; others suspected satanic cult mem-
 bers were responsible. The Bogota press reported that the Prosecutor General's of-
 fice had developed a list of 15 people it believed may have been involved. In Decem-
 ber the Prosecutor General's office arrested Pedro Pablo Ramirez Garcia in relation
 to the crimes.
 On February 27, three unidentified assailants murdered Jesus Maria Valle, presi-
 dent of the Antioquia Permanent Committee for the Defense of Human Rights, in
 his Medellin office. Valle had been an outspoken critic of what he termed the com-
 plicity of regional politicians and elements of government security forces in para-
 military and narcotics-related killings. In July the police arrested five persons in
 conjunction with Valle's murder, all but one of the five were detained and under-
 going prosecution at year's end. In September the authorities indicted paramilitary
 leader Carlos Castano for alleged intellectual authorship of Valle's murder.
 On June 3, a court sentenced two former mayors of El Carmen de Chucuri,
 Santander department, to 11 years in prison for their involvement in paramilitary
 death squads in the early 1990'. The authorities arrested both men in 1992 when
 they turned themselves in; both are believed to remain in prison. The ex-mayors
 and their followers have been linked to a paramilitary vigante group known as
 Death to Kidnapers (MAS), believed to be responsible for several massacres and the
 1987 murder of the mayor of Sabana de Torres. The arrest and prosecution of the
 
 
 552
 two men came after an investigation in 1992 into paramilitary groups conducted by
 the human rights nongovernmental organization (NGO) Justice and eace.
 On April 18, three persons posing as journalists killed Eduardo Umana Mendoza,
 perhaps the country's best-known and most controversial human rights lawyer, in
 his office in Bogota. In November the Prosecutor General's office detained Fabio
 Mosquera Uribe, Victor Manuel Campuzano, Hernando Alberto Araque Marmol, and
 Regner Antonio Mosquera Velasco on suspicion of involvement in the killing. The
 authorities suspected Mosquera of intellectual authorship of the crime. In December
 the office also arrested Jose Bernardo Hernandez Ossa and Teresa de Jesus Leal
 Medina. The latter reportedly served as the link between the crime's intellectual au-
 thors and Umana's killers. The case was pending at year's end.
 On July 26, Betty Camacho was murdered just 6 days after relinquishing her con-
 gressional seat. The police arrested several persons in August and charged them in
 connection with the case.
 In September the Government indicted five persons (detaining three of them) for
 the May 1997 murders of two CINEP workers, Mario Calderon and Elsa Alvarado.
 The suspects allegedly were linked to paramilitary groups. Elsa's father, Carlos Al-
 varado, also was killed. The three detained suspects are Walter Jose Alvarez Rivera,
 Gabriel Jaime Alvarez Paniagua, and Pablo Vanderly Vargas Garcia. The Prosecu-
 tor General's office also ordered the arrest of ACCU leader paramilitary leaders Car-
 los and Fidel Castano in relation to these crimes, but neither had been detained at
 year's end. Carlos Castano denied the charges. On December 26, the Prosecutor
 General's office also arrested brothers Juan Carlos and Fernando Gonzalez
 Jaramillo for allegedly having participated in the murders. Medellin narcotics traf-
 ficker Gustavo Adolfo Utegui Lopez, suspected by many of having been the intellec-
 tual author of the crime, was arrested in November on unrelated murder charges.
 Narcotics traffickers also were responsible for other killings. On September 14,
 unknown persons shot and killed congressman and Liberal Party member Jorge
 Humberto Gonzalez in Medellin traffic. According to the Press, his murder may have
 been related to narcotics trafficking. He was the fourth member of Congress to be
 murdered since May 1997. No suspects were identified in the case.
 Catholic priest Alcides Jimenez Chicangana was shot 18 times as he gave a ser-
 mon in a Catholic church in Popayan, Putumayo department on September 11,
 hours after he led a public rally for peace. On September 22, investigators detained
 alleged narcotics trafficker Luis Angel Canas for .the crime; the case was pending
 at year's end.
 The guerrillas of the FARC, the ELN, and the People's Liberation Army (EPL)
 continued to commit extrajudicial killings, often targeting noncombatants in a man-
 ner similar to that of paramilitary groups. According to CINEP, guerrillas commit-
 ted 160 homicides outside of combat during the first 9 months of the year. Local
 elected officials or candidates for public office, teachers, civic leaders, business own-
 ers, and peasants opposed to their political or military activities were common tar-
 gets. The Colombian Federation of Municipalities reported that eight mayors were
 murdered between January and August, and positively identified guerrillas as re-
 sponsible for four of the killings. Guerrillas were also the principal suspects in the
 other four cases. Police and military personnel were targeted for killings (see Sec-
 tion 1.g.). Guerrilla gups also killed members of indigenous groups (see Section
 5) and labor leaders see Section 6.). Communities controlled by guerrillas also expe-
 rienced killings described as cleansing of criminal antisocial elements.
 On May 12, former Defense Minister General Fernando Landazabal Reyes was
 murdered near his Bogota home. Although guerrillas were widely suspected of hav-
 ing murdered Landazabal, police had announced no leads in the case at year's end.
 In 1997 the national human rights Ombudsman received 71 complaints against
 guerrillas of killings and 29 complaints against guerrillas of massacres.
 There was no progress regarding the leftist coalition Popular Unity (UP) party's
 1996 complaint to the IACHR that charged the Government with "action or omis-
 sion" in what the UP termed "political genocide" against the UP and the Communist
 Party. In its October 1997 submission to the IACHR, the Reinsertion Foundation
 human rights organization charged that 13 regional UP political leaders had been
 killed and 3 tortured during the first 9 months of that year. The Government and
 the UP continued without success in their efforts to reach an amicable solution
 under the auspices of the IACHR.
 There were no new developments in the investigation of Gerardo Antonio Palacio
 for his role in the August 1995 massacre in Chigorodo, Antioquia.
 b. Disappearance.-"Forced disappearance," while explicitly prohibited by the
 1991 Constitution, remained an act not explicitly outlawed under the Penal Code,
 although the law codifies kidnaping for extortion and "simple kidnaping" as crimes,
 and continued to be a problem. An estimated 3,000 cases of forced disappearance
 
 
 553
 have been formally reported to the authorities since 1977; very few have ever been
 resolved.
 CINEP reported that the army was responsible for one case of forced disappear-
 ance during the first 9 months of 1998, and that paramilitary groups were respon-
 sible for 126 cases during the same period. According to the Permanent Commission
 for the Defense of Human Rights (CPDH), 117 persons were the victims of forced
 disappearances from January to June. It reported that nearly half of those cases oc-
 curred in Antioquia department. In May members of a paramilitary organization
 kidnaped 25 persons in Barrancabermeja (see Section l.a.). The CPDH identified
 paramilitary groups as being responsible for 86 of the 117 disappearances. The great
 majority .of victims of forced disappearance were never seen or heard from again.
 The military judicial system took no action in the case agast General Alvaro
 Velandia Hurtado, the former commander of the Twentieth Brigade, who was ac-
 cused of the 1987 forced disappearance, trture, and murder of M-19 member Nydia
 Erika Bautista.
 The authorities suspended from duty Police Major Manuel de Jesus Lozada Pla-
 zas, the former deputy commander of the Governments elite antikidnaping squads,
 and placed him on half-pay subsequent to his arrest in March 1997. His trial in a
 civilian court continued at year's end. There have been no results reported in the
 investigation into cooperation between these squads, known as GAULA, and illegal
 paramilitary groups.
 Kidnaping was an unambiguous, standing policy and major source of revenue for
 both the FARC and ELN. The NGO Pais Libre reported that there were 2,216
 kidnapings during the year-fully one-third more cases than in 1997. It said that
 1,799 of these were financially motivated, and 417 cases were politically motivated.
 Pals Libre attributed 667 cases to the FARC, 566 to the ELN, 109 to the EPL, 43
 to other guerrilla groups, 231 to common criminals, 20 to paramilitary groups, and
 580 to "unknown organizations." According to Pais Libre, politicians, cattlemen, chil-
 dren, and businessmen were guerrillas' preferred victims. Among the 2,216 kidnap
 victims were 131 children. GAULA officers and other units of the security forces
 freed 341 kidnap victims during the year. 721 kidnap victims remained in captivity
 at the end of the year, and 82 were murdered. A total of 1,039 kidnap victims were
 freed during the year through negotiation, payment of ransoms, or unilateral action
 by kidnapers, and 21 escaped their captors. Arrests or prosecutions in any of these
 cases were rare.
 Guerrillas continued to kidnap political leaders. The Federation of Colombian Mu-
 nicipalities reported that guerrillas kidnaped and later released 33 mayors between
 January and September, including 8 Antioquia department mayors released in Sep-
 tember in *exchange for continuing the ELN-civil society talks begun in Germany
 (see Section 1.g.). As part of the same quid-pro-quo, the ELN also released Senator
 Carlos Espinosa Facciolince on September 20, after 51 days in captivity. On Septem-
 ber 22, the EPL freed Congressman Gerardo Tamayo, after 57 days in captivity.
 Despite increased pressure by the Government on the FARC to account for 3
 American missionaries kidnaped by FARC guerrillas in January 1993, their where-
 abouts and condition remained unknown. The FARC, the ELN, and other guerrilla
 groups regularly kidnaped foreign citizens throughout the year; some were released
 after weeks or months of captivity, while others still were held at year's end.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution and criminal law explicitly prohibit torture, as well as cruel, inhu-
 man, or degrading treatment or punishment; however, reports of incidents of police
 and military torture or mistreatment of detainees continued. Of the 140 investiga-
 tions of security force members completed by members of the human rights unit of
 the Attorney General's office between January and July, 108 investigations involved
 allegations of torture committed in previous years. However, the Attorney General's
 office only can sanction administratively or refer to the Prosecutor General's office
 those it finds gulty. Reports of torture by Government forces declined. Torture and
 abuse often occurred m connection with illegal detentions in the context of
 counterinsurgency operations.
 The _Offie of the Attorney General reeived 119 complaints of torture during the
 year; they reported investigating 462 cases of torture committed by the police, DAS,
 army, prison officials, and other agents of the State between June 1995 to October
 1996. CIP deemed the army responsible for eight reported torture cases during
 the first 9 months of the year and the police for none. The National Institute of Fo-
 rensic Medicine reported that the bodies of 325 of the 24,306 persons murdered dur-
 ing 1997 showed signs of torture.
 CINEP attributed 41 of the remaining 42 cases it had documented to paramilitary
 groups. Paramilitary groups increasingly made use of threats both to intimidate op-
 ponents and to raise money. Letters demanding payment of a "war tax" and a threat
 
 
 554
 to mark the victim as a "military target" if he failed to pay were typical. The CPDH
 reported that 5,429 persons were threatened with murder between January and
 June. The NGO reported that nearly half were public school teachers, and that ap-
 proximately half of all threat recipients were residents of Antioquia department.
 Guerrilla groups also tortured and abused persons. The bodies of many persons
 detained and subsequently killed by guerrillas showed signs of torture and dis-
 figurement. For example, on September 24 the FARC's 13th front abducted soldier
 Juan Paul Becerra Evanjuanoy and his brother, reservist Damacio Becerra
 Evanjuanoy, from their parents' home. Guerrillas tortured the brothers, decapitated
 them, and sent the heads to their parents. CINEP reported that guerrillas also
 made use of threats, both to intimidate opponents and to raise money, and, like the
 paramilitary groups, sent letters demanding payments of a war tax, along with
 threats to make persons military targets.
 Prison conditions are generally harsh, especially for those prisoners without sig-
 nificant outside support Severe overcrowding, and dangerous sanitary and health
 conditions remained serious problems. In December 1997, a visiting IACHR mission
 declared that the living conditions in Bogota's La Picota prison constituted "cruel,
 inhuman, and degrading treatment of the inmates." According to the Committee for
 Solidarity with Political Prisoners, a majority of prisoners' food was provided by out-
 side, private sources. The nation's 168 prisons and jails held nearly 45,000 inmates
 at year's end, 59 percent more than their planned capacity. In a number of the na-
 tion's largest prisons, the overcrowding was severe. Medellin's Bellavista prison, the
 nation's largest, was built to house 1,700 inmates; in December 1997 it housed more
 than 5,100 inmates. Bogota's La Modelo prison and the Palmira prison outside Cali
 both held more than 250 percent of their designed capacity. Only 8,000 prisoner ac-
 commodations met international standards, and no new construction was under-
 taken during the year. The National Police reported in December that La Modelo
 prison had the highest incidence of homicide of any "neighborhood" in Bogota. The
 National Prison Institute (INPEC) reported 150 murders in the country's 168 pris-
 ons during the year.
 Forty-seven percent of all prison inmates are pretrial detainees. The remaining
 53 percent are split roughly between those appealing their convictions and those
 who have exhausted their appeals and are serving out their terms.
 Prison conditions prompted a nationwide civil disobedience campaign from August
 1997 through May 1998 by prisoners who physically prevented the entry of more
 prisoners into their cells. In response, the Government began talks with prisoners
 and NGO's to address inmates' concerns, which ended the campaign but produced
 no other significant results. Prison violence was common; in one 45-day period, pris-
 oners murdered 23 fellow inmates of Bogota's La Modelo prison. Instances of abuse
 by and corruption among prison staff, as well as ongoing criminal activities by in-
 mates, were so serious that in 1997 judicial authorities announced the transfer of
 control of the maximum security wings of several prisons (La Picota, La Modelo,
 Palmira, and Itagui in Medellin) from the civilian National Prisons Institute
 (INPEC) to the National Police. By year's end, control of La Modelo and Palmira
 prisons had been returned to INPEC. On May 21, 19 paramilitary supporters of Vic-
 tor Carranza escaped from Bogota's maximum security prison. On May 23, guerril-
 las of the FARC's 6th Front attacked the San Isidro Prison in Popayan. One guard
 and 2 prisoners died in the attack, which freed 324 prisoners, including several
 dozen FARC guerrillas, and was the biggest single prison escape to date.
 There are no separate facilities for pretrial detainees and convicted prisoners.
 However, key narcotics traffickers and some guerrilla leaders get special cells with
 many comforts, some of which-such as access to two-way radios, cellular tele-
 phones, and computers-allowed them to continue their illegal activities from inside
 jail. Local or regional military and jail commanders did not always prepare manda-
 tory detention registers or follow notification procedures; as a result, precise ac-
 counting for every detainee was not always possible.
 The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) continued to have routine
 access to most prisons and police and military detention centers.
 The ICRC obtained more frequent access, although still on an ad hoc basis, to
 prisoners held by paramilitary groups or guerrilla forces.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution includes several provi-
 sions designed to prevent illegal detention; however, there continued to be instances
 in which the authorities arrested or detained citizens arbitrarily.
 The law prohibits incommunicado detention. Anyone held in preventive detention
 must be brought before a prosecutor within 36 hours to determine the legality of
 the detention. The prosecutor must then act upon that petition within 36 hours of
 its submission. Despite these legal protections, instances of arbitrary detention con-
 
 
 555
 tinued. CINEP received 24 reports of arbitrary detention during the first 9 months
 of 1998.
 Conditional pretrial release is available under certain circumstances; for example,
 in connection with minor offeiises or after unduly lengthy amounts of time in pre-
 ventive detention. It is not available in cases of serious crimes, such as homicide
 or terrorism.
 Guerrilla groups captured and held prisoner members of the army and police. In
 September the FARC proposed a prisoner exchange and confirmed the identity of
 278 army and police personnel it held. In addition, the ELN reportedly held more
 than 20 such prisoners. At year's end, the FARC and the ELN were believed to hold
 almost 400 police and army personnel captive.
 The Constitution prohibits exile, and forced exile is not formally practiced. How-
 ever, there were repeated instances of individuals pressured into self-exile for their
 personal safety. Such cases included persons from all walks of life, including politi-
 cians, human rights workers, slum-dwellers, business executives, and farmers. The
 threats came from various quarters: elements of the military, paramilitary groups,
 guerrilla groups, narcotics traffickers, and other criminal elements.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The civilian judicial system, reorganized under the
 1991 Constitution, is independent of the executive and legislative branches, both in
 theory and in practice, although the suborning or intimidation of judges, witnesses,
 and prosecutors by those indicted or involved is common. The human rights Om-
 budsman's office reported receipt of 1,533 complaints of denial of the right to due
 legal process during 1997.
 The judiciary includes the Constitutional Court, Supreme Court of Justice, the
 Council of State, the Superior Judicial Council, and lower courts. The Prosecutor
 General's office is an independent prosecutorial body that brings criminal cases be-
 fore the courts. The National Tribunal serves as the first court of appeal for cases
 tried before the regional (anonymous) courts. The Supreme Court of Justice serves
 as the appellate court for decisions by the national tribunal and lower appellate
 courts, and is also the court in which elected officials, generals, admirals, diplomats,
 and judges are tried. The Council of State is the appellate court for civil cases. The
 Constitutional Court is to adjudicate cases of constitutionality. The Superior Judi-
 cial Council is the administrative arm of the judicial branch, and also has the re-
 sponsibility to determine whether individual cases are to be tried in civilian or mili-
 tary courts. Jurisdictional ciashes among the Constitutional Court, Supreme Court
 of Justice, the Council of State, and the Superior Judicial Council were common, due
 to the lack of a single supreme judicial authority capable of deciding issues of com-
 petence or constitutional interpretation.
 As part of the Ministry of Defense, the military judiciary falls under the executive
 branch, rather than under the judicial branch. The armed forces commander is also
 the president of the military judiciary, which has no dedicated corps of military law-
 yers. The Uniform Code of Military ustice predates the 1991 Constitution and does
 not contemplate some contemporary crimes. The workings of the military judiciary
 lack transparency and accountability, contributing to a generalized lack of con-
 fidence in the system's ability to bring human rights abusers to justice.
 In response to this situation, in 1997 the Constitutional Court directed the mili-
 tary judicial system to relinquish to the civilian judiciary the investigation and pros-
 ecution of grave human rights violations and other alleged crimes not directly relat-
 ed to acts of service-the 1991 constitutional standard for determining whether a
 case should be tried by the military or civilian judiciary. According to the Colombian
 Jurists' Commission, the court's decision defined only three crimes-torture, geno-
 cide, and forced disappearance-as grave human rights violations (homicide was not
 included). However, two of these-genocide and forced disappearance-were not
 codified as crimes in the civilian Penal Code and thus could not be prosecuted as
 such in civilian courts. Similar crimes, such as kidnaping, murder, and mass mur-
 der, are codified in the civilian code.
 The Superior Judicial Council assigned most cases involving high-level military
 personnel to the military courts, where convictions in human rights-related cases
 were the rare exception. According to the 1991 Constitution, general-rank officers
 are to be tried by the Supreme Court, but that provision was ignored in practice,
 and no definitive court ruling has resolved varying judicial interpretations of the
 provision. In determining which alleged crimes were to be tried by military tribu-
 nals, the Superior Judicial Council also regularly employed an extremely broad defi-
 nition of relation to acts of service, thus ensuring that most uniformed defendants
 of any rank were tried in military tribunals.
 On October 1, the Superior Judicial Council determined that Brigadier General
 Fernando Millan Perez's alleged organization of a paramilitary group constituted an
 act of service and therefore turned General Millan s case over to the military judici-
 
 
 556
 ary for prosecution (see Section L.a.). In reaching its decision, the Superior Judicial
 Council determined that it was not bound by the Constitutional Courts narrow 1997
 interpretation of the 1991 constitutional standard of relation to acts of service. The
 Superior Judicial Council's decision effectively ended the Prosecutor General's inves-
 tigation into whether General Millan had provided weapons and intelligence to
 paramilitary groups in Santander department.
 In cases where military officers were tried, convicted, and sentenced for human
 rights violations, they generally did not serve out prison terms and in some cases
 remained on active military duty. The Attorney General's office investigates mis-
 conduct by public officials, including members of the military and police. Its con-
 stitutional mandate only provides for the imposition of administrative sanctions; it
 has no authority to bring criminal prosecutions. Although the Attorney General's of-
 fice may refer cases to the Prosecutor General's office for investigation and prosecu-
 tion, it often fails to do so. The Attorney General's office can draw upon a nation-
 wide network of hundreds of government human rights investigators covering the
 country's 1,073 municipalities. However, since it cannot impose criminal sanctions,
 it is incapable of adequately punishing human rights abusers.
 Judges have longbeen subject to threats and intimidation, particularly when
 dealing with cases involving members of the armed forces or of paramilitary, narcot-
 ics, and guerrilla organizations. Although the number of instances of violent attacks
 against prosecutors and judges declined in recent years, prosecutors, judges, and de-
 fense attorneys continued to be subjected to threats and acts of violence. Moreover,
 prosecutors reported that potential witnesses in major cases often lacked faith in
 the Government's ability to protect their anonymity and were thus unwilling to tes-
 tify, ruining chances for successful prosecutions. These concerns led in 1984 to the
 creation of regional or public order jurisdictions to prosecute cases involving the
 crimes of narcotics trafficking, terrorism, kidnaping, subversion, extortion, and some
 cases of human rights violations. In these courts, prosecutors, judges, witnesses, and
 attorneys act under cover of anonymity for security reasons. Given security con-
 cerns, and since testimony and evidence typically is provided to the judge in written
 form, regional court trials are not public. While a 1993 reform of the Criminal Pro-
 cedures Code addressed certain procedural shortcomings within the system, signifi-
 cant problems remained. It still was difficult for defense attorneys to impeach or
 crss-examine anonymous witnesses, and often the defense attorneys did not have
 unimpeded access to the State's evidence. As a result of such concerns, judges may
 no longer base a conviction solely on the testimony of an anonymous witness. None-
 theless, national and-international human rights groups continue to accuse these
 courts of violating fundamental rights to due process, including the right to a public
 trial. Some of the most vocal congressional critics of these courts continued to be
 implicated in investigations. The faceless regional courts are expected to be abol-
 ished in 1999.
 The Supreme Court elects the Prosecutor General for a 4-year term, which does
 not coincide with that of the President, from a list of three candidates chosen by
 the President. The Prosecutor General is tasked with investigating criminal offenses
 and presenting evidence against the accused before the various judges and tribu-
 nals. However, this office retains significant judicial functions and, like other ele-
 ments of the civilian judiciary, it is struggling to make the transition from a Napole-
 onic legal system to a mixed one that incorporates an adversarial aspect.
 In an attempt to deal with impunity, the Prosecutor General in October 1995 cre-
 ated a special Human Rights Unit as part of the regional courts system. The unit
 achieved significant results; its group of 25 anonymous prosecutors addressed sev-
 eral hundred cases involving massacres, extrajudicial killings, kidnapings, and ter-
 rorism. These prosecutors issued arrest warrants against members of the public se-
 curity forces, paramilitary, drug trafficking, and guerrilla organizations and success-
 fully arrested 60 suspects by year's end.
 The Human Rights Unit of the Prosecutor General's office attempted to combat
 prevailing impunity by investigating, indicting, or prosecuting 74 security force
 members during the year, including 12 officers, on a variety of charges including
 kidnaping, sponsorship of paramilitary groups, torture, and homicide. However, the
 Attorney General's office and the security forces did not always follow up with in-
 structions that those ordered arrested be removed from their duties, -denied the
 right to wear the uniform, or turned over to civilian judicial authorities. For exam-
 ple, despite convictions on terrorism charges in a civilian court and subsequent sen-
 tences to prison, Lt. Cols. Baez Garzon and Londono Tamayo remained on active
 duty with the army's Third Brigade and the logistical supply brigade in Bogota, re-
 spectively (see Section l.a.).
 The Constitution specifically provides for the right to due process. Judges deter-
 mine the outcome of all trials; there are no jury trials. The accused is presumed
 
 
 innocent until proven guilty and has the right to representation by counsel, al-
 though representation or the indigenous and the indigent historically has been in-
 adequate. On October 3, Superior Judicial Council president Gustavo Cuello Iriare
 stated that the civilian judiciary suffered from a backlog of 3.5 million cases. The
 number of outstanding arrest warrants stood at 150,000 in August.
 Trials conducted by the regular courts are public. Defendants have the right to
 be present and the right to timely consultation with an attorney. Regular court de-
 fendants and their attorneys have the right to question, contradict, and confront
 witnesses against them, to present witnesses on their own behalf, and to have ac-
 cess to government evidence relevant to the case. Direct confrontations are not pos-
 sible in regional courts, where everything is processed on paper without a face-to-
 face courtroom trial. Defendants also have the right to appeal a conviction to a high-
 er court.
 The Chamber of Deputies elects the Public Ministry's National Ombudsman for
 Human Rights for a 4-year term, which does not coincide with that of the President.
 The office has the constitutional duty to ensure the promotion and exercise of
 human rights. In addition to providing public defense attorneys in criminal cases,
 the Ombudsman's 32 departmental offices throughout the country provide a legal
 channel for thousands of complaints and allegations of human rights violations. In
 practice, however, the Ombudsman's operations are underfunded and understaffed,
 slowing its development of a credible public defender system.
 The Government states that it does not hold political prisoners. The ICRC re-
 ported that it monitored approximately 3,700 cases of imprisoned citizens accused
 of terrorism, rebellion, or aiding and abetting the insurgency, which are crimes pun-
 ishable under law.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The law
 provides for the protection of these rights; however, at times the authorities in-
 frinedupon them. The law generally requires a judicial order signed by a prosecu-
 tor for the authorities to enter a private home, except in cases of hot pursuit. The
 Ministry of Defense continued training public security forces in legal search proce-
 dures that comply with constitutional and human rights. Due to intimidation, cor-
 ruption, or the absence of evidentiary proof collected directly by prosecutors, guer-
 rilla suspects captured by the security forces in or out of combat and turned over
 to the judicial authorities were routinely set free.
 A judicial order or the approval of a prosecuting attorney is required to authorize
 the interception of mail or the monitoring of either landline or cellular telephones.
 This protection extends to prisoners held in jails. However, various state authorities
 sometimes monitored telephones without obtaining prior authorization. No officials
 have ever been disciplined for illegal wiretapping. The security forces subjected
 human rights groups to surveillance, harassment, and threats (see Section 4).
 uerilas forcibly recruited children to serve as soldiers (see Section 1.g.).
 g. Use of Excessive Force and Violations of Humanitarian Law in Internal Con-
 flicts.-The internal armed conflict and narcotics trafficking are the central causes
 of violations of human rights and humanitarian law. Government security forces
 violated international humanitarian law, and paramilitary groups and guerrillas, in
 particular, committed numerous abuses.
 The ICRC reported that the Government, including military authorities, followed
 an open-door policy toward the ICRC and readily incorporated Red Cross curricu-
 lums on international humanitarian law in standard military training. The military
 has reduced its emphasis on body counts as a means of assessing field performance.
 According to military sources, local commanders typically preferred to transfer or
 discharge soldiers accused of serious human rights violations, rather than initiate
 court martial proceedings.
 The CPDH reported 112 massacres between January and November, which re-
 sulted in the deaths of at least 667 people. For example, soldiers of the Boca battal-
 ion of the army's Third Brigade executed five civilians whom they suspected of being
 members of the FARC's 58th front at a road block at San Pablo municipality,
 Narino department (see Section L.a.). Twenty-four massacres occurred in Antioquia
 department.
 Human rights monitors charged that on December 13, military aircraft attacked
 the jungle village of Santo Domingo, Arauca, killing 18 civilians and wounding 25
 other civilians, while engaging the FARC. The military strongly denied these ac-
 counts, stating that a battle took place 6 kilometers outside the town, and that
 deaths in Santo Domingo were the result of a FARC truck bomb that exploded pre-
 maturely. The Prosecutor General established a commission to conduct a full inves-
 tigation of the incident, which continued at year's end.
 According to the independent Advisory Committee for Human Rights and Dis-
 placements (CODHES), some 308,000 persons were forcibly displaced from their
 
 
 homes by violence during the year, the highest number during any year during the
 past decade. CODHES estimated that the government forces were responsible for
 approximately 6 percent of displacements during the year. Internally displaced citi-
 zens during 1995-98 probably exceeded 750,000, but the total number-and the
 number of those who were permanently displaced-was difficult to discern.
 CODHES states that some persons .have been displaced for as long as 10 years, but
 is unable to identify a typical timeframe for displacement. Some persons return to
 their homes within days or weeks, others within months, and some never return.
 Some displaced persons move several times after fleeing their original home, mak-
 ing tracking difficult The Government does not consider persons to be displaced
 after 2 years. CODHES estimated that perhaps 65 percent of displacements became
 permanent. Many displaced persons lost access to health care and employment, and
 displaced children often were unable to attend school.
 The Samper Government's response to the needs of the displaced population was
 inadequate, and by its own estimate reached only 10 percent of the displaced popu-
 lation. Most displaced citizens receiving government assistance received it for only
 90 days. Conditions at the Government's two camps for displaced persons, at
 Pavarando and Turbo, were poor and unhygienic; health care is poor and there are
 few educational or employment opportunities. In March the Bogota office of the
 United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights criticized the Government for
 sometimes encouraging civilian populations to move back to their homes before the
 security situation had normalized.
 Thousands of displaced persons also fled to Panama, Ecuador, and Venezuela,
 where they usually were denied refugee status, treated as illegal immigrants, and
 denied protection or assistance. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refu-
 gees (UNHCR) opened an office in Bogota in July in order to address the problem.
 According to army estimates, there were between 50,000 and 70,000 antipersonnel
 landmines located in 13 departments. The armed forces deployed approximately
 20,000 landmines during the year, most of which were used to defend static posi-
 tions. Due to the ongoing conflict, no generalized mine clearance program was un-
 derway at year's end. Thousands of displaced persons were unable to return to their
 homes due to the presence of antipersonnel mines. There were no known civilian
 mine awareness campaigns or assistance programs for civilian victims of landmines.
 The human rights Ombudsman's office reported an increase in violence against
 women during 1997, especially in war zones. It noted that most female victims in
 zones of conflict chose not to report the abuses they had suffered, in part due to
 a lack of confidence in the efficacy of governmental institutions, to address their
 problems. The Ombudsman noted that female leaders of political and peasant orga-
 nizations in the Uraba-Antioquia region were increasingly the targets of persecu-
 tion, threats, torture, and executions. According to the Ombudsman's 1997 report,
 there was a substantial increase in sexual assault and murder of women that year,
 particularly in Meta, Arauca, Cesar, and Sucre departments.
 The many paramilitary groups are diverse in their motivations, structure, leader-
 ship, and ideology. The 1997 establishment of the United Self-Defense Groups of Co-
 lombia (AUC) as a national umbrella organization was designed both to provide a
 national structure and to develop a more coherent political culture for the nation's
 local and regional paramilitary groups. The AUC paramilitary umbrella group com-
 prises between 5,000 and 7,000 combatants, who are members of 7 major organiza-
 tions. Although illegal, some paramilitary groups reflected rural citizens' legitimate
 desire to defend themselves from the guerrilla threat. Other groups were actually
 the paid, private armies of drug traffickers or large landowners.
 The victims of paramilitary killings were often unarmed civilians that the para-
 military groups believed to be guerrillas or guerrilla collaborators. Par=-iltary
 groups sought the death or displacement of civilians as punishment for perceived
 ties to the guerrillas. The  aramilitary groups centered their actions in selective
 killings, intimidation, and the forced displacement of persons not directly involved
 in the hostilities. They targeted teachers, labor leaders, community activists, may-
 ors, town council members, and peasants whom they accused of supporting the left-
 ist guerrillas. A number of these victims included members of indigenous commu-
 nities (see Section 5). A paramilitary group publicly claimed responsibility for the
 May 16 massacre of 36 civilians at Barrancabermeja (see Section l.a.). Paramilitary
 groups redoubled their efforts to deprive guerrillas of civilian support by displacing
 civilian populations believed to be sympathetic to the guerrillas. CODHES estimated
 that paramilitary groups were responsible for approximately 54 percent of displace-
 ments.
 On October 25, about 100 members of the AUC paramilitary group attacked the
 town of San Carlos, Antioquia. They killed 10 persons whom they accused of being
 
 
 559
 guerrilla collaborators. The group also destroyed a police station and a bank. The
 -Prosecutor General's office was investigating the attack at year's end.
 On July 26, AUC leader Castano and a dozen other paramilitary commanders
 signed an agreement with the national human rights Ombudsman, other members
 of the National Peace Council, and representatives of civil society committing the
 paramilitary groups to a search for national peace. Coming a few weeks after the
 ELN agreement with civil society groups, the "Nudo de Paramillo" agreement rep-
 resented an attempt by the paramilitary leaders to obtain poitical status and to be
 considered for participation in future peace talks.
 In November Castano held a radiotelephone conversation with "Antonio Garcia,"
 the military leader of the ELN guerrillas, which was later printed in the newspaper
 El Tiempo. Castano argued that the paramilitary groups are independent of the
 Government, but Garcia argued that the guerrillas had seen AUC members ex-
 change their armbands for army armbands, and that the guerrillas did not believe
 the paramilitaries were entirely autonomous. Castano admitted that some elements
 of the armed forces tolerate the paramilitary groups, but asserted that the military
 had increased pressure on his forces.
 On December 28 and 29, the FARC's 18th front launched a major attack against
 Castano's personal headquarters in southern Cordoba department. The guerrillas
 tortured and decapitated noncombatant civilians Norbey Guarneli Ruiz, Nicolas Ca-
 ballero Leyva, and Reinoldo Gutierrez Pastrana; dismembered and castrated Adolfo
 Adisal Cordero; and shot to death Maria Elena Vargas, Johnny Maria Sanchez, and
 Milady Isabel Montalvo, as well as a 3 year-old and an infant. The FARC publicly
 admitted to the killings and decapitations, which it attempted to justify with allega-
 tions that the civilians were paramilitary supporters.
 In July the Government discontinued its practice (begun in December 1994) of or-
 ganizing and registering civilian rural defense cooperatives, known collectively as
 'Convivir," which were to provide counterinsurgency intelligence to local police and
 military commanders. The human rights Ombudsman had voiced opposition to these
 groups, and in November 1997 the Constitutional Court ruled that while the groups
 were a constitutional means to combat guerrillas, they must relinquish rifles, ma-
 chine guns, and other restricted weaponry in their possession. (Although the au-
 thorities originally intended these groups to be unarned, they subsequently author-
 ized an undetermined number to carry small arms in self-defense.) Other Convivir
 groups clearly were operating outside the terms of the law, as they were armed with
 rifles, shotguns, machine guns, and other weaponry, much of it authorized, sold, or
 otherwise provided to them by the military.
 On July 25, Convivir president Carlos Alberto Diaz announced the disbanding of
 289 of the program's 414 officially recognized rural security cooperatives. However,
 credible outside observers place the total number of such groups at over 700; many
 Convivir groups were organized but never licensed by the Government. There were
 credible charges that- some cooperative members committed serious abuses while
 fighting alongside, or as members of, paramilitary units. In August more than 200
 members of 39 disbanded cooperatives in northwestern Colombia announced that
 their communities would join the illegal AUC network of paramilitary units, citing
 a need to defend themselves from guerrillas.
 Some local army and police commanders tacitly tolerated-and sometimes aided
 and abetted-the activities of paramilitary groups, despite the public pronounce-
 ments of the Government and the new armed forces high command that they in-
 tended to combat paramilitary violence. At times, individual commanders and troops
 at local levels armed, coordinated actions with, or shared intelligence with para-
 military groups, although such behavior was less pervasive than in previous years.
 Some military commanders effectively afforded paramilitary groups protection by al-
 lowing them to establish their base camps in areas generally under military control.
 Paramilitary groups that received such shelter often were able to attack guerrillas
 with minimal fear of reprisals. On October 18, Vice President Gustavo Bell admitted
 that despite official policy, "some members of the armed forces have maintained
 some degree of links to paramilitary groups." He stated that there was no evidence
 of an "institutional decision" by the armed forces to cooperate with paramilitary
 groups.
 Despite the continuing significant rise in paramilitary activity since 1992, the
 military often has failed to give priority to confronting these illegal groups. On occa-
 sion, the military did engage paramilitary groups. On February 8, 23 paramilitary
 members in the Uraba region ran out of ammunition during a clash with the FARC
 and surrendered to elements of the army's 17th Brigade, which turned them over
 to civilian authorities for prosecution. On February 18, police and marines killed 4
 members of a paramilitary group and captured 10 others in the same area. In Sep-
 tember elements of the 24th Brigade captured eight paramilitary members in
 
 
 Putumayo department and turned them over to the civilian judiciary. They were
 jailed and the Prosecutor's office was taking action against them at year's end.
 The Prosecutor General's office and, to a lesser extent, the Attorney General's of-
 fice, in some instances took action in response to security force members' collabora-
 tion with paramilitary groups. On July 23, the Prosecutor General's human rights
 unit arrested four members of the army's 17th Brigade and charged them with
 sponsorship and formation of illegal paramilitary groups. The four men were ar-
 rested on the basis of testimony from several of the paramilitary members who had
 surrendered to that brigade in February.
 The Ministry of Defense reported that during the year the police captured 93
 paramilitary members, the military 95, the DAS 4, and the Prosecutor General's
 technical investigative corps 30. Additionally, it stated that the army killed 23 para-
 military members, the navy 3, the DAS 3, and the police 5. Due to differences in
 record-keeping and definitions, the Ministry of Defense's statistics fell short of those
 issued by the Prosecutor General's office, which reported that the police captured
 212 paramilitary members during the year, the army 81, and the Prosecutor Gen-
 eral's technical investigative corps 125. Both sets of figures represented a substan-
 tial increase in army efforts against aramilitary groups over 1997, when the army
 reported killing 25 paramilitary members and capturing 31.
 Paramilitary groups on occasion used landmines, and sometimes accepted under-
 age combatants in their ranks. Paramilitary groups attacked hospitals and ambu-
 lances and were responsible for multiple violations of the protected status of reli-
 gious and medical personnel, of the wounded, and of the emblem of the Red Cross.
 For example, on August 18, members of a paramilitary group pursued a man that
 they had wounded into a local hospital in Yolombo, Antioquia, and killed him there.
 Guerrilla organizations continued to pursue strategies that routinely violated citi-
 zens' rights. Their tactics consistently included extrajudicial killings, kidnaping, tor-
 ture, targeting of civilian populations and installations, and the forced recruitment
 of children under the age of 15.
 Two main guerrilla armies, the FARC and the ELN, as well as the much smaller
 EPL, ERP, ERG, and Jaime Bateman groups, commanded an estimated total of be-
 tween 11,000 and 17,000 full-time guerrillas operating in more than 100 semi-
 autonomous groups in 30 of the nation's 32 departments. These groups undertook
 armed actions in nearly 700 of the 1,073 municipalities. Both the FARC and the
 ELN systematically attacked noncombatants and violated citizens' rights through
 the use of tactics such as extrajudicial killings, forced disappearances, the mutila-
 tion of bodies, FARC attacks on ambulances, and ELN executions of patients in hos-
 pitals.
 Guerrillas killed members of indigenous communities (see Section 5). According
 to CODHES, guerrillas were responsible for approximately 29 percent of forced dis-
 placements. Guerrillas used landmines both to defend static positions (such as base
 camps, cocaine laboratories, and sites at which kidnap victims were held) and as
 indiscriminate weapons of terror. Landmines planted by guerrillas or disguised as
 everyday items such as soccer balls or paint cans often resulted in the killing or
 maiming of civilian noncombatants; thousands of displaced persons were unable to
 return to their homes due to the presence of antipersonnel mines. Although the
 ELN agreed to halt recruitment of children under the terms of the June 28 Mainz
 "Heaven's Gate" agreement, both'it and the larger FARO regularly pressed children
 into their ranks (see Section 5). Once recruited, child guerrillas are virtual prisoners
 of their commanders and subject to various forms of abuse. Sexual abuse of young
 girls is a particular problem.
 On August 3-5, guerrillas attacked army and police posts in 18 different depart-
 ments. The most serious defeat of government forces occurred at Miraflores,
 Guaviare department, where a counterarcotics base shared by the army and the
 National Police was overrun and destroyed. The guerrillas captured 73 army and
 56 police personnel and kidnaped several humanitarian workers, including 1 priest,
 1 medical doctor, and 3 nurses, as well as several other civilians. FARC national
 military commander Jorge Briceno directed the attack from the Miraflores public
 hospital. Car -bombs in Cucuta and Medellin destroyed private homes. In some
 areas, guerrillas shut down basic utility services, such as electricity and water, and
 attacked infrastructure facilities such as hydroelectric plants and power lines.
 On November 1, hundreds of FARC guerrillas overran the Vaupes departmental
 capital of Mitu razing several city blocks, including private homes, a church, and
 a school. The FARC directed its attack from the hospital and used medical person-
 nel as human shields. After killing at least 16 security force personnel, the FARC
 took 67 policemen and an undetermined number of soldiers prisoner. The FARC also
 carried out a selective campaign of killings while it occupied the town, resulting in
 several civilian deaths.
 
 
 On October 18, the ELN blew up a gas and oil pipeline at Machuca, Antioquia
 department. The explosion started a fire that killed 74 persons, including 38 chil-
 dren, and injured more than 50 persons. In November the ELN retracted its public
 accusation that the army had been responsible for the explosion and admitted its
 own responsibility. ELN guerrillas killed more than 70 other civilians that month,
 despite an October 12 ELN-civil society meeting to discuss reducing civilian casual-
 ties during hostilities. Additionally, ELN and FARC attacks on the Cano Limon-
 Covenas and other pipelines caused oil spills that resulted in massive environ-
 mental damage.
 On June 15, the ELN kidnaped 15 women, among them 5 children, while they
 were performing civic action work for the army's 14th Brigade, according to Human
 Rights Watch. The women were members of the army's "Steel Girls" program, and
 were wearing army-issued uniforms. The ELN claimed that, by giving the 15 women
 uniforms, the army had-put them at risk of being misidentified as combatants. The
 ELN released them on July 4.
 Guerrilla groups also were responsible for multiple violations of the protected sta-
 tus of religious and medical personnel, of the wounded, and of the emblem of the
 Red Cross. On July 17, members of the FARC fired on a helicopter-ambulance in
 Amalfi, Antioqua department, causing it to crash. On September 15, FARC guerril-
 las killed eight public health workers at Mocoa, Putumayo department, who were
 engaged in a malaria eradication campaign. At times, guerrillas also showed no re-
 spect for the sanctity of bodies of the dead. For example, on February 17, two sol-
 diers were killed and five were wounded at the army's artillery school in Bogota
 when a grenade exploded as the soldiers unloaded the corpses of three soldiers who
 had died in combat with the PARC. The PARC had booby-trapped one of the bodies.
 President Pastrana, during his campaign and upon assuming office, placed a high
 priority upon achieving a lasting internal peace. President-elect Pastrana initiated
 peace efforts with a July 9 meeting with the FARC leader "Manuel Marulanda
 Velez". Civil society groups met with the ELN in Mains, Germany, on June 28 in
 an attempt to "humanize" the Government-ELN conflict. A second round of ELN-
 civil society talks was held in Colombia on October 12. In a prenegotiation conces-
 sion to the FARC, the Government committed to withdraw its military forces from
 five southern municipalities November 7 for a 90-day period, effectively turning the
 area over to FARC control. At year's end, the Government and the FARC agreed
 to begin peace talks at a town in the demilitarized region in January 1999.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of the
 press; although the Government generally respected this right in practice, there
 were significant exceptions. Journalists regularly practiced self-censorship. How-
 ever, the privately owned print media published a wide spectrum of political view-
 points and often voiced harsh antigovernment opinions without fear of administra-
 tive reprisals. In 1997 the Constitutional Court declared unconstitutional the Gov-
 ernment's ban on publication of guerrilla communiques by the media. A ban on the
 publication of evidence pertaining to criminal investigations, based on the secrecy
 provisions of the Penal Code and an anticorruption statute, remained in effect.
 The Samper administration had been quick to apply pressure on the media when
 its core interests were threatened. Self-censorship was common, either to curry
 favor with the Government or to avoid political or economic retaliation. In August
 the dean of the Los Andes University law school and the leading daily newspaper
 El Tiempo filed a legal challenge to the 1997 Constitutional Court decision uphold-
 ing a 1996 law that gave the Government unprecedented authority over the content
 of television programming. The plaintiffs asserted that the law was aimed at limit-
 ing journalistic freedom of expression. There was no decision on the challenge at
 year's end.
 Journalism faculties and students widely criticized a March 18 Constitutional
 Court ruling that abolished professional licensing requirements for journalists, al-
 though it met with the approval of the media and free speech advocates.
 All citizens have the right to seek a judicial injunction or motion ("tutela") in
 cases involving violations of constitutional rights. This provides all persons and or-
 ganizations, including the media, with a mechanism to denounce both governmental
 and private violations of fundamental rights.
 Both Colombian and international journalists typically work in an atmosphere of
 threats and intimidation. Fearing for their safety, journalists often refrain from pub-
 lishing or airing stories counter to the interests of paramilitary groups, guerrillas,
 or narcotics traffickers. Unknown assailants murdered at least 13 journalists during
 the year, although not all the murders apparently were related to the journalists'
 work. Oscar Garcia, sports reporter for Bogota's second leading daily newspaper, El
 
 
 Espectador, was murdered on February 23, the day before he was to meet with rep-
 resentatives of the Prosecutor General's office, apparently to discuss organized crime
 links that he had uncovered to the bullfighting industry. On April 16, Nelson
 Carvajal, a radio announcer and schoolteacher, was killed in front of his school in
 Pitalito, Huila department. Carvajal's killing was apparently in retaliation for his
 charges of corrupton against a former Pitalito mayor. On May 19, radio and tele-
 vision journalistBerabe Cortes, who was rumored to have links to organized crime,
 was murdered in Cali. On August 14, Luz Amparo Jimenez, a television reporter
 and coordinator of the Cesar and La Guajira department chapters of "Redepaz" (an
 NGO), was murdered in front of her home in Valledupar. She recently had criticized
 local police links to paramilitary groups and regularly covered the plight of dis-
 placed persons in the region (see Section 4). On September 11, journalist and aspir-
 ing poitician Nestor Vllar Jimenez was killed in Villavicencio. On October 14, the
 editor of El Panorama magazine, Jose Arturo Guapacha, was murdered in the Valle
 del Cauca department. He had written exposes on narcotics traffickers.
 According to Pas Libre, 16 journalists were kidnaped during the year. Most of
 the incidents appeared to have been related to journalists' work and aimed at in-
 timidation.
 The trend of concentration of media ownership continued, with large news firms
 purchasing small, previously independent newspapers. Wealthy families or groups
 associated with one or the other of the two dominant political parties also continued
 to expand their holdings of news media, and regional firms continued to purchase
 local news media outlets. Although the press remained generally free, these trends
 in news media ownership tended to narrow the range of political viewpoints offered.
 Despite an attempt by some members of Congress to abolish it, the National Tele-
 vision Commission continued to oversee television programming throughout the
 year. Detractors charged that it was susceptible to political influence.
 The Government generally respected academic freedom, and there was a wide
 spectrum of political activity throughout the country's universities. However, para-
 military groups and guerrillas often targeted teachers at the elementary and second-
 ary levels in areas of conflict. The CPDH reported that slightly more than 10 per-
 cent of all victims of politically motivated homicides during the year were public
 school teachers.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 freedom of peaceful assembly, and the Government respects this right in practice.
 The authorities normally do not interfere with public meetings and demonstrations
 and usually grant the required permission except when they determine that there
 is imminent danger to public order.
 In September and October, a lengthy strike by public sector workers resulted in
 violent confrontations with the police on various occasions in several cities (see Sec-
 tion 6.a.).
 The Constitution provides for freedom of association, and the Government re-
 spects this right in practice. Any legal organization is free to associate with inter-
 national groups in its field. Membership in proscribed organizations, such as the
 FARC, the ELN, and the EPL, is a crime.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for complete religious freedom,
 and the Government respects this right in practice. There is little religious discrimi-
 nation. Roman Catholic religious instruction is no longer mandatory in public
 schools, and a 1994 Constitutional Court decision declared unconstitutional any offi-
 cial government reference to religious characterizations of the country. The Govern-
 ment permits proselytizing among the indigenous population, provided that it is
 welcome and does not induce members of indigenous communities to adopt changes
 that endanger their survival on traditional lands. The law on the freedom of religion
 provides a mechanism for religions to obtain the status of recognized legal entities.
 Both the Constitutional Court (on October 7) and the Council of State (on Novem-
 ber 19) found that Jehovah's Witnesses and Mennonite seminarians had been regu-
 larly forced into military service, in violation of constitutional and other provisions
 for conscientious objectors. Both the court and council directed the Government to
 exempt the two churches' seminarians in the same manner that it exempted Roman
 Catholic seminarians.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Constitution provides citizens with the right to travel domestically
 and abroad. Outsiders who wish to enter Indian tribes' reserves must be invited.
 In areas where counterinsurgency operations were underway, police or military offi-
 cials occasionally required civilians to obtain safe-conduct passes; paramilitary
 forces and guerrillas often used similar means to restrict travel in areas under their
 control. Military counterinsurgency operations, forced conscription by paramilitary
 and guerrilla organizations, guerrilla incursions, and land seizures instigated by
 
 
 563
 wealthy individuals or narcotics traffickers often forced peasants to flee their homes
 and farms, and there was a very large population of internally displaced persons
 (see Section 1.g.).
 Colombia has had a tradition of providing asylum since the 1920's. During the
 1970's, Colombia granted asylum  to Argentine, Chilean, Uruguayan, and Para-
 guayan citizens seeking refuge from dictatorial regimes. The right to asylum, under
 terms established by law, is provided for in the 1991 Constitution.
 The Government cooperates with the office of the UNHCR and other humani-
 aian organizations in assisting refugees and internally displaced persons. The
 Government reserves the right to determine eligibility for asylum, based upon its
 own assessment of the nature of the persecution an applicant may have suffered.
 The issue of the provision of first asylum did not arise. There were no reports of
 the forced expulsion of persons to a country where they feared persecution.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The Constitution provides for the right of citizens to change their government,
 and citizens exercise this right in regularly scheduled elections by secret ballot. Con-
 servative Part. candidate Andres Pastrana defeated Liberal Party candidate
 Horaio Serpa in a second round of presidential elections on June 21 with heavy
 voter turnout. Both rounds of presidential elections were free, fair, and transparent
 despite some threats by paramilitary groups, narcotics traffickers, and guerrillas to
 the electoral process.
 Presidential elections are held every 4 years, with the incumbent barred for life
 from reelection. The Liberal and Conservative parties have long dominated the for-
 mal political process with one or the other winning the presidency. Public employees
 are not permitted to participate in partisan campaigns. Officially, all political par-
 ties operate freely wthout government interference. Those that fail to garner 50,000
 votes in a general election lose the right to present candidates and may not receive
 funds from the Government. However, they may reincorporate at any time by pre-
 senting 50,000 signatures to the National Electoral Board. Voting is voluntary and
 universal for citizens age 18 and older, except for active-duty members of the police
 and armed forces, who may not vote.
 Although large numbers of citizens voted in the March 8 election for all 102 mem-
 bers of the Senate and all 161 members of the Chamber of Representatives, voter
 turnout was significantly lower in guerrilla-controlled areas. In spite of guerrillas'
 detention of 52 electoral workers and burning of electoral materials and vehicles,
 normal elections were carried out in more than 90 percent of all municipalities. Al-
 though the elections were free, fair, and transparent, several Congressmen publicly
 identified with narcotics trafficking interests were reelected. Some vote buying and
 fraud took place, but neither significantly affected the outcome of the elections.
 There are no legal restrictions, and few practical ones, on the participation of
 women or minorities in the political process, although both are underrepresented in
 official and party positions. A female independent presidential candidate, Noemi
 Sanin, made a strong third-place finish during the first round of the presidential
 elections in May and was the first-place finisher in most large cities, including Bo-
 gota. Voters elected 14 women to the Senate and 19 women to the Chamber of Rep-
 resentatives in March. President Pastrana appointed 2 women to his 16-member
 Cabinet, to serve as Ministers of Communication and Foreign Trade.
 Indigenous people are underrepresented in government and politics. Two of 102
 Senate seats are reserved for indigenous representatives. Blacks also are underrep-
 resented in government and politics. A 1993 law that set aside two House seats for
 citizens of African heritage was declared unconstitutional in September 1996 by the
 Constitutional Court, which nonetheless allowed the incumbents to complete their
 terms in office. There is one black Senator but no black members of the Chamber
 of Representatives.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 A large and varied nongovernmental human rights community is active, providing
 a wide range of views. Among the many groups are: the Catholic Bishops Con-
 ference, the Colombian Commission of Jurists; the Intercongregational Commission
 for Justice and Peace; the Permanent Committee for the Defense of Human Rights;
 the Center for Investigations and Popular Research; the Advisory Committee for
 Human Rights and Displacements; the Latin American Institute for Alternative
 Legal Services; the Committee in Solidarity with Political Prisoners; the Association
 of Families of Detained and Disappeared Persons; the Reinsertion Foundation (fo-
 cused on demobilized guerrillas); the Pals Libre Foundation (focused on the rights
 
 
 564
 of kidnap victims); and the Vida Foundation (focused on the rights of victims of
 guerrilla violence). Other international human rights organizations in the country
 that were active include the ICRC and Peace Brigades International. The United
 Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights has an office in Bogota.
 Although the Government generally did not interfere directly with the work of
 human rights NGO's, many prominent human rights monitors worked under con-
 stant fear for their physical safety. Human rights groups were subjected to surveil-
 lance, harassing phone calls, graffiti campaigns, and threats by elements of the mili-
 tary, intelligence, police, paramilitary, and guerrilla forces.
 Jose Fernando Castro, the national human rights Ombudsman, was harshly criti-
 cal of the Government's human rights record during his March 20 presentation to
 the United Nations Human Rights Commission in Geneva. He cited excessive use
 of force by the military, weak institutions, and harassment of the Ombudsman's of-
 fice as problems faced by human rights monitors. Castro said that the Government
 prevented representatives of his office from visiting the scene of fighting that month
 between the security forces and guerrillas, even to the point of an attack by heli-
 copter on a boat his office was using.
 NGO's investigated and reported on human rights abuses committed by govern-
 ment forces, various paramilitary groups, and the guerrilla armies. Many NGO's ex-
 pressed serious concern over the growing paramilitary and guerrilla violence-and
 the Government's increasingly apparent inability to stop either of them. In particu-
 lar, a number of NGO, as well as governmental, human rights officials were
 alarmed by the rapid growth of paramilitary groups, both in terms of their respon-
 sibility for an increased proportion of human rights violations and their growing po-
 litical and military power.
 The human rights community came under intense pressure during the year.
 Human Rights Watch/Americas cited a "shocking record" of killings of human rights
 defenders. Human rights monitors were subject to a systematic campaign of intimi-
 dation, harassment, and violence. Human Rights Watch also reported that 6 human
 rights defenders were killed in the first 10 months of the year, including Jesus
 Maria Valle in Medellin and Eduardo Umana Mendoza in Bogota (see Section l.a.).
 In addition, many human rights workers fled the country for their own safety.
 On May 13, an urban counterterrorism unit attached to the army's Fifth Division,
 accompanied by a state prosecutor bearing a legal warrant, raided the offices of the
 human rights NGO Justice and Peace. The ostensible purpose of the raid was to
 search for information regarding subversive guerrilla movements and the May 12
 assassination of former Defense Minister and commanding General Fernando
 Landazabal. During the course of the raid, the security forces at least partially cop-
 ied the NGO's '"never again" database of over 40,000 human rights crimes. The
 search was executed with a valid search warrant issued by the Prosecutor General's
 office, but the prosecutor who accompanied the army was fired for having conducted
 the raid in an illegal manner. The armed forces, which have no legal mandate to
 perform domestic law enforcement functions, retained evidence that by law should
 have been turned over to the prosecutor. Army commander Major General Jorge
 Enrique Mora (who was in command of the Fifth Division at the time) told the press
 that Thirteenth Brigade commander Brigadier General Rito Alejo del Rio (see Sec-
 tion l.a.) had ordered the raid.
 Police had no leads in the August 11 murder of Luz Amparo Jimenez, a television
 reporter and NGO coordinator who criticized local police links to paramilitary
 groups, in Valledupar, Cesar department (see Section 2.a.). In September the Gov-
 ernment indicted five persons in the 1997 murders of two CINEP workers (see Sec-
 tion l.a.).
 The ICRC, working with the presidential human rights adviser and the public se-
 curity forces, helped provide training programs in international humanitarian law.
 These programs were directed not oniy at affected civilian populations but also were
 integrated into the military training curriculum. The security forces sent 26,000 per-
 sons to an average of 4.5 hours of training. Many observers credited these programs
 with having done much to foster a climate of increased respect for human rights
 and international humanitarian law within the military forces in recent years. The
 ICRC continued to expand its operations, with an office in Bogota plus 15 offices
 in various conflict zones.
 The Government has an extensive human rights apparatus, which includes the
 Office of the President's Adviser for Human Rig hts, the Ministry of Defense human
 rights office, and ependent offices for each of the armed forces. The national
 human rights Ombudsman and its regional representatives and corps of public de-
 fenders, the Attorney General's office and its office for human rights and regional
 representatives, and the Prosecutor General's office and its human rights unit are
 Sindependent institutions, not subject to executive branch direction. In September
 
 
 565
 
 President Pastrana named Vice President Gustavo Bell to serve concurrently as
 Presidential Advisor on Human Rights.
 The human rights Ombudsman's office received 20,101 human rights corplaints
 during 1997 and concluded investigations of 11,047 complaints that year. It also
 provided 29,406 free legal consttns through its corps of nearly 1,000 public de-
 fenders, many of whom work only part time.
 In 1997 the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights opened a field
 office in Bogota to observe human rights practices and advise the Government.
 Originally scheduled to end after 1 year, the Government asked that its mandate
 be extended until April 1999. The office is tasked with monitoring and analyzing
 the human rights situation throughout the country and with the provision of assist-
 ance to the Government, civil society, and NGO's in the field of human rights pro-
 tection. It submitted reports to the Government and to the United Nations and
 spoke out publicly on particularly egregious abuses committed by government, para-
 military, or guerrilla forces.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 ciail Status
 The Constitution specifically prohibits discrimination based on race, sex, religion,
 disability, language, or social status. In practice, however, many of these provisions
 are not enforced. The killing of homosexuals as part of the practice of social cleans-
 ing continued.
 Women.-Rape and other acts of violence against women are pervasive in society,
 and like other crimes, seldom are prosecuted successfully. The quasi-governmental
 Institute for Family Welfare (ICBF) and the Presidential Adviser's Office for Youth,
 Women, and Family Affairs continued to report high levels of spouse and partner
 abuse throughout the country. The ICBF conducted programs and provided refuge
 and counseling for victims of spousal abuse, but the level and amount of these serv-
 ices were dwarfed by the magnitude of the problem.
 The Institute for Legal Medicine estimated in 1997 that 239,400 persons are vic-
 tims of sexual abuse annually, 88 percent of them women. The Institute also esti-
 mated that 95 percent of all abuse cases are never reported to the authorities.
 The 1996 Law on Family Violence criminalizes violent acts committed within fam-
 ilies, including spousal rape. The law also provides legal recourse for victims of fam-
 fly violence, immediate protection from physical or psychological abuse, and judicial
 authority to remove the abuser from the household. It allows a judge to oblige an
 abuser to seek therapy or reeducation. For acts of spousal sexual violence, the law
 mandates sentences of 6 months to 2 years and denies probation or bail to offenders
 who disobey restraining orders issued by the courts. A 1997 law also made addi-
 tional, substantial modifications to the Penal Code and introduced sentences of be-
 tween 4 and 40 years for crimes against sexual freedom or human dignity, including
 rape, sex with a minor, sexual abuse, induction into prostitution, and child pornog-
 raphy. The law also repealed an old law that fully exonerated a rapist if he subse-
 quently offered to marry the victim and she accepted. However, there was little evi-
 dence that this legislation was enforced systematically. The Institute for Legal
 Medicine's preliminary 1998 statistics state that 25,669 persons were victims of do-
 mestic violence.
 Women also faced an increased threat of torture and sexual assault due to the
 internal conflict (see Section .g.).
 The Constitution prohibits any form of discrimination against women and specifi-
 cally requires the authorities to ensure "adequate and effective participation by
 women at decisioAmaking levels of public administration." Even prior to implemen-
 tation of the 1991 Constitution, the law had provided women with extensive civil
 rights. However, despite these constitutional provisions, discrimination against
 women persisted. According to figures published by the United Nations, women's
 earnings for formal sector, nonagricultural work correspond to approximately 85
 percent of men's earnings for comparable work, and women must demonstrate high-
 er qualifications than men when applying for jobs. Moreover, women constitute a
 disproportionately high percentage of the subsistence labror ork force, espeially in
 rural areas.
 1997 ICBF data indicated that although working women suffered from a higher
 rate of unemployment than men, the economically active female population had a
 higher level of education than did men. However, some 39 percent of working
 women were employed in minimum wage jobs, compared with 31 percent of men.
 Despite an explicit constitutional provision promising additional resources for sin-
 gle mothers and government efforts to provide them with training in parenting
 skills, women's groups reported that the social and economic problems of single
 mothers remained great. The Constitutional Court ruled in September 1997 that
 
 
 566
 pregnant women and mothers of newborn children under 3 months of age could not
 be fired from their jobs without "just cause." Bearing children, the Court ruled, was
 not just cause.
 Children.-The Constitution formally provides for free public education, which is
 compulsory between the ages of 6 and 14. Nevertheless, an estimated 25 percent of
 children in this age group do not attend school, due to lax enforcement of truancy
 laws, inadequate classroom space, and economic pressures to provide income for the
 family.
 Despite significant constitutional and legislative commitments to the protection of
 children's rights, these were implemented only to a minimal degree. The Constitu-
 tion imposes the obligation on family, society, and the State to assist and protect
 children, to foster their development, and to assure the full exercise of these rights.
 A special Children's Code sets forth many of these rights and establishes services
 and progrms designed to enforce the protection of minors. Children's advocates re-
 ported the need to educate citizens with regard to the code as well as the 1996 and
 1997 laws on family violence, which had been drafted particularly to increase legal
 protection for women and children.
 According to the Institute for Legal Medicine, during 1997, 82 percent of sexual
 abuse victims were minors. An estimated 25,000 boys and girls under age 18 work
 in the sex trade. In 1996 legislators passed a law prohibiting sex with minors or
 the employment of minors for prostitution, and they amended that law in 1997 to
 provide that conviction for nonviolent sexual abuse of a child under age 14 carries
 a prison sentence of 4 to 10 years. Conviction for rape of anyone under the age of
 12 carries a mandatory sentence of 20 to 40 years in prison. Although enforcement
 of such laws is lax, crimes against children are being dealt with more severely than
 in the past. The ICBF -oversees all government child protection and welfare pro-
 grams and funds nongovernmental and church programs for children.
 In conflict zones, children often were caught in the crossfire between the public
 security forces, paramilitary groups, and gerrilla organizations. Children suffered
 disproportionately from the internal conflict, often forfeiting opportunities to study
 as they were displaced by conflict and suffered psychological traumas. The use of
 child soldiers was common. Paramilitary groups sometimes pressed children into
 their ranks. The army estimated that 3,000 children were members of the ELN or
 FARC (see Section 1.g.). In August the Simon Bolivar Guerrilla Coordinating Board
 admitted that 7 to 10 percent of armed guerrillas were children between the ages
 of 13 and 17. The ELN agreed to stop forcing children into its ranks as part of its
 accord with civil society signed on June 28 in Mainz, Germany.
 People With Disabilities.-The Constitution enumerates the fundamental social,
 economic, and cultural rights of the physically disabled, but serious practical im-
 pediments exist that prevent the full participation of disabled persons in society.
 There is no legislation that specifically mandates access for the disabled. According
 to the Constitutional Court, physically disabled individuals must have access to, or
 if they so request, receive assistance at, voting stations. The Court also has ruled
 that the social security fund for public employees cannot refuse to provide services
 for the disabled children of its members, regardless of the cost involved.
 Indigenous People.-There are approximately 80 distinct ethnic groups among the
 800,000-plus indigenous inhabitants. The Constitution gives special recognition to
 the fundamental rights of indigenous people. It provides for a special criminal and
 civil jurisdiction, based upon traditional community laws, within Indian territories.
 The Ministry of Interior, through the Office of Indigenous Affairs, is responsible for
 protecting the territorial, cultural, and self-determination rights of Indians. Ministry
 representatives are located in all regions of the country with indigenous populations
 and work with other governmental human rights organizations, as well as with
 NGO human rights groups and civil rights organizations, to promote Indian inter-
 ests and investigate violations of indigenous rights. Nonetheless, members of indige-
 nous groups suffer discrimination in the sense that they traditionally have been rel-
 egated to the margins of society. Few opportunities exist for those who might wish
 to participate more fully in modern life. In addition, indigenous communities suffer
 disproportionately from the internal armed conflict (see Section 1.g.).
 According to the National Agrarian Reform Institute (INCORA), 344,505 people
 live on designated- Indian reserves. Traditional Indian authority boards operate
 some 476 reserves; the boards handle national or local funds and are subject to fis-
 cal oversight by the national Comptroller General. These boards administer their
 territories as municipal entities, with officials elected or otherwise chosen according
 to Indian tradition. Indigenous communities are free to educate their children in
 traditional dialects and in the observance of cultural and religious customs. Indige-
 nous men are not subject to the national military draft.
 
 
 567
 The INCORA estimated that some 40 indigenous communities had no legal title
 to land that they claimed as their own, and reported that an estimated 400 requests
 by indigenous communities to establish new reserves remained outstanding at year's
 end.
 Members of indigenous communities continued to be victims of all sides in the in-
 ternal conflict, and a number of them were killed. In August the national human
 rights Ombudsman stated in his annual report that the indigenous communities
 most affected by extrajudicial killings during 1996-97 were the Zenu (26 persons
 reportedly killed by paramilitary groups), the Embera-Katio (9 persons allegedly
 Ted b the army, paramilitary groups, and the FARC), the Paez (8 persons alleg-
 edly killed by paramilitary groups and guerrillas), the Koreguaje (23 persons known
 to have been killed by the PAR), the Los Pastos (1 person reportedly killed by the
 army), and the Pijao (1 person reportedly killed by the army). In 1997 alone, 63 in-
 digenous leaders and 13 other indigenous community members were killed and 3
 disappeared. According to the human rights Ombudsman, the authorities had
 opened investigations into many of the cases at year's end, but no one had been
 tried and convicted for these crimes.
 Occidental Petroleum returned some of its exploration concessions to the Govern-
 ment after attempts to negotiate with the Uwa tribe broke down. The tribe had pro-
 tested a 1995 award to Occidental and Ecopetrol allowing them to explore lands
 claimed by the U'wa. The U'wa had filed a complaint before the IACHR. A 1997
 OAS joint study with a university recommended the immediate and unconditional
 suspension of oil exploration or exploitation activities; clarification of the status of
 Uwa territories and protected reserves; and the development of a formal process of
 consultation under auspices of the Government. The Tewa had also threatened to
 commit collective suicide if their wishes were not respected.
 NationallRaciallEthnic Minorities.-Approximately 2 million citizens of African
 heritage live primarily in the Pacific departments of Choco, Valle del Cauca, and
 Narino, and along the Caribbean coast. They represent roughly 5 percent of the
 total population, while the figures of the National Administrative Department of
 Statistics place the national black population at 16 percent of the total, or 6.4 mil-
 lion.
 Blacks are entitled to all constitutional rights and protections but traditionally
 have suffered from discrimination. Blacks are underrepresented in the executive
 branch, judicial branch, and civil service positions, and in military hierarchies. De-
 spite the passage of the African-Colombian law in 1993, little concrete progress was
 made in expandig public services and private investment in the Choco or other pre-
 dominantly black regions. The same law also authorized black communities to re-
 ceive collective titles to some Pacific coast lands. However, black leaders complained
 that the Government was slow to issue titles, and that their access to such lands
 was often inhibited by the presence of armed groups or individuals. Unemployment
 among African-Colombians ran as high as 76 percent in some communities. Choco
 department remains the department with the lowest per capita level of social invest-
 ment and is last in terms of education, health, and infrastructure. It also has been
 the scene of some of the nation's most unremitting political violence, as paramilitary
 forces and guerrillas struggled for control of the Uraba region.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution recognizes the rights of workers to
 organize unions and to strike, except for members of the armed forces and police,
 and those "essential public services" as defined by law. However, legislation that
 prohibits all public employees from striking is still in effect, even if often overlooked.
 Nonemergency government employees staged a 2-day national strike in September
 to protest low wages, which did not keep up with inflation. That action led to a 3-
 week long strike in October that brought many public services to a halt, caused vio-
 lent clashes between strikers and the police, and saw the Cpossibly strike-related)
 murders of seven labor leaders. Afer lengthy negotiations, the Government agreed
 to a 15 percent average wage increase for all state workers, with teachers to receive
 a 16 percent increase (slightly below the estimated inflation rate of 17 percent).
 Union leaders agreed to make up lost workdays, and the Government agreed to
 withdraw pending legislation to privatize telecommunications and social security in
 order to obtain more worker input.
 The 1948 Labor Code (which repeatedly has been amended) provides for auto-
 matic recognition of unions that obtain at least 25 signatures from potential mem-
 bers and comply with a simple registration process at the Labor Ministry. The law
 penalizes interference with freedom of association. It allows unions to determine
 freely internal rules, elect officials, and manage activities, and forbids the dissolu-
 tion of trade unions by administrative fiat. According to Labor Ministry estimates,
 
 
 568
 a proximately 7 percent of the work force is organized in about 2,235 labor unions.
 Te number of unions fell dramatically during 1998 (from a 1997 total of approxi-
 mately 4,900), reflecting the effects of new legislation that encouraged the consolida-
 tion of individual companies' unions into broader, industry-based unions. Some
 unions also were closed due to the murders of their leaders.
 Before staging a legal strike, unions must negotiate directly with management
 and, if no agreement results, accept mediation. By law, public employees must ac-
 cept binding arbitration if mediation fails; in practice, public service unions decide
 by membership vote whether or not to seek arbitration.
 In May the International Labor Organization (ILO) expressed its serious concern
 at allegations of murders, forced disappearances, death threats, and other acts of
 violence agalnst trade union officials and members. The ILO documented more than
 300 murders of trade unionists during 1995-98. The ILO harshly criticized the Gov-
 ernment for failing, since November 1996, to provide it with information on a single
 case of detention, trial, and conviction of anyone responsible for the murder of
 unionists.
 After a 1993 complaint by the ILO regarding the Labor Code's provision that gov-
 ernment officials supervise union meetings, the Government discontinued its prac-
 tice of monitoring such meetings. The Government has not addressed other ILO
 criticisms of the Labor Code. In 1993 the ILO had complained about the following
 provisions of the law: the requirement that government officials be present at as-
 semblies convened to vote on a strike call; the legality of firing union organizers
 from jobs in their trades once 6 months have passed following a strike or dispute;
 the requirement that contenders for trade union office must belong to the occupation
 their union represents; the prohibition of strikes in a wide range of public services
 that are not necessarily essential; various restrictions on the right to strike; the
 power of the Minister of Labor and the President to intervene in disputes through
 compulsory arbitration when a strike is declared illegal; and the power to dismiss
 trade union officers involved in an unlawful strike.
 Labor leaders throughout the country continued to be targets of attacks by para-
 military groups, guerrillas, narcotics traffickers, and their own union rivals. On Oc-
 tober 20, a lone gunman shot and killed Jorge Ortega, vice president of the Central
 Workers' Union (CUT), the country's largest public sector labor organization. Ortega
 had used his position to denounce paramilitary actions and the paramilitary pres-
 ence in the country, and his name appeared on a list of nine labor and political lead-
 ers allegedly targeted for murder by extreme rightwing elements. However, just be-
 fore his murder, he had criticized the ELN attack on an oil pipeline in Antioquia
 that left 74 persons dead (see Section 1.g.). The new Pastrana administration of-
 fered a $65,000 (100 million pesos) award for information leading to the arrest of
 the killer, but no one had been detained at year's end.
 In December the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions announced in
 Geneva that at least 50 union members had been killed. because of their union ac-
 tivities during 1998. Many of these were targeted by the-FARC for their member-
 ship in, or sympathy- with, the- National Syndicate -of Agricultural Industry Workers
 (Sintrainagro), a union largely composed of demobilized EPL members. Many of the
 murdered Sintrainagro members had worked in the banana industry in Uraba re-
 gion. Other murders of labor leaders were concentrated in Arauca, Antioquia,
 Casanare, Cesar, Cordoba, and Magdalena departments. Also among those targeted
 for killing during the year were leaders of the Union of Syndicated Labor (USO),
 the National Federation of Agricultural Syndicates (Fensuagro), and the Cordoba
 department Teachers' Association (Ademacor). The National Organized Labor School
 -(ENS) reported in December that 82 unionized workers were murdered during the
 year, a significant decrease from the 154 murderers it reported in 1997. The ENS
 attributed the decline to a quieting of tensions in the Uraba region, where leftist
 banana workers historically have heen the targets of paramilitary and-guerrilla at-
 tacks. The ENS also reported that 2a union leaders had been killed during the year.
 The 1995 collective work convention between Ecopetrol and the USO expired in
 November. At year's end, no new agreement had been reached. The accord was the
 result of the Government's restructuring, ratherthan privatizing, Ecopetrol to avoid
 massive layoffs. The USO leadership remained in open conflict with the Government
 on many issues. USO leaders reported that its members in the oil-producing
 Magdalena Medio region continued to receive death threats from presumed para-
 military groups, who have accused USO-officials of working with the ELN guerrillas
 waging a sabotage campaign against the nation's oil pipelines.
 Unions are free to join international confederations without government restric-
 tions.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The Constitution protects the
 right of workers to organize and engage in collective bargaining. Workers in larger
 
 
 firms and public services have been most successful in organizing, but these union-
 ized workers represent only a small portion of the economically active population.
 High unemployment, traditional antiunion attitudes, and weak union organization
 and leadership limit workers' bargaining power in all sectors.
 The law forbids antiunion discrimination and the obstruction of free association.
 Government labor inspectors theoretically enforce these provisions, but because
 there are 260 labor inspectors to cover 1,073 municipalities and more than 300,000
 companies, the inspection apparatus is weak. Furthermore, labor inspectors often
 lacked basic equipment, such as vehicles. The Labor Code calls for fines to be levied
 for restricting freedom of association and prohibits the use of strike breakers.
 Collective pacts-agreements between individual workers and their employers-
 are not subject to collective bargaining and typically are used by employers to ob-
 struct labor organzation. Although employers must register collective pacts with the
 Ministry of Labor, the Ministry does not exercise any oversight or control over them.
 The Labor Code also eliminates mandatory mediation in private labor-manage-
 ment disputes and extends the grace period before the Government can intervene
 a conct. Federations and confederations may assist affiliate unions in collective
 bargaining.
 Labor law applies to the country's nine free trade zones (FTZ's), but its standards
 often were not enforced in the zones, in part due to lack of political will. Public em-
 ployee unions have won collective bargaining agreements in the FTZ's of Barran-
 quilla, Buenaventura, Cartagena, and Santa Marta, but the garment manufacturing
 enterprises in Medellin and Risaralda, which have the largest number of employees,
 are not organized. National labor leaders claim that in these FTZ's the provisions
 of the Labor Code dealing with wages, hours, health, and safety are not honored.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Constitution forbids slavery
 and any form of forced or compulsory labor, and this prohibition is generally re-
 spected in practice. The law prohibits forced or bonded labor by children but the
 Government does not have the resources to enforce this prohibition effectively (see
 Section 6.d.). Although there were no known instances of forced child labor in the
 formal economy, some children were forced to serve as paramilitary or guerrilla
 combatants (see Section 1.g) or to work as prostitutes or coca pickers.
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment.-The Con-
 stitution bans the employment of children under the age of 14 in most jobs, and the
 Labor Code prohibits the granting of work permits to youths under the age of 18.
 A 1989 decree establishing the Minors' Code prohibits the employment of children
 under age 12 and stipulates exceptional conditions and the express authorization of
 Labor Ministry inspectors for the employment of children between the ages of 12
 and 17 (inclusive). However, these requirements largely are ignored in practice, and
 only 5 percent of those children that work have filed for the required work permits.
 By allowing children of ages 12 and 13 to work under any conitions, the law con-
 travened international standards on child labor, which set the minimum legal age
 for employment in developing countries at 14 years.
 In the formal sector, child labor laws are enforced through periodic review by the
 Ministry of Labor and by the military, which ensures compliance with mandatory
 service requirements. However, in the informal labor sector and in rural areas, child
 labor continues to be a problem, particularly in agriculture and mining. Children
 as young as 11 years of age work full time in almost every aspect of the cut flower
 industry as a way to supplement family income. Even children enrolled in school
 or, in some cases, too young for school, accompany their parents to work at flower
 plantations at night and on weekends. In the mining sector, coal mining presents
 the most difficult child labor problem. Many marginal, usually family-run, oper-
 ations employ their young children as a way to boost production and income. The
 work is dangerous and the hours are long. Younger children carry water and pack-
 age coal, while those age 14 and up engage in more physically demanding labor such
 as carrying bags of coal. Even though these informal mining operations are illegal,
 the Ministry of Labor has undertaken little or no enforcement action against them.
 Recent data on child labor were not available. A 1997 study by Los Andes Univer-
 sity using 1992 data concluded that at least 1.6 million children between the ages
 of 12 and 17 worked. Child participation in agricultural work soared at harvest
 times. The study found that 31 percent of 14- to 17-year-olds are active participants
 in the labor market, and 784,000 children between the ages of 6 and 11 worked.
 Twenty-five percent of working children were employed in potentially dangerous ac-
 tivities. According to army estimates, at least 3,000 children were employed by para-
 military groups and guerrillas as combatants (see Section 5). School attendance by
 working children was significantly lower than for nonworking children. Only 10 per-
 cent of child laborers were found to be covered by the health services of the social
 security system. A 1996 study by the national human rights Ombudsman of child
 
 
 labor in Putumayo department found that 22 percent of the children between the
 ages of 5 and 18 were full-time coca pickers. In the municipality of Orito, the figure
 reached 70 percent. The Government prohibits forced and bonded labor by children
 but is unable to enforce this prohibition effectively (see Section 6.c.).
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The Government sets a uniform minimum
 wage for workers every January to serve as a benchmark for-wage bargaining. The
 monthly minimum wage, set by tripartite negotiation among representatives of busi-
 ness, organized labor, and the Government was about $150 (203,826 pesos) through-
 out the year. The minimum wage does not provide a decent standard of living for
 a worker and family. Because the minimum wage is based on the Government's tar-
 get inflation rate, the minimum wage has not kept up with inflation in recent years.
 By government estimates, the price of the family shopping basket is 2.4 times the
 minimum wage. However, 77 percent of all workers earn no more than, and often
 much less than, twice the minimum wage.
 The law provides for a standard workday of 8 hours and a 48-hour workweek, but
 it does not require specifically a weekly rest period of at least 24 hours, a failing
 criticized by the ILO. Legislation provides comprehensive protection for workers' oc-
 cupational safety and health, but these standards are difficult to enforce, in part
 due to the small number of Labor Ministry inspectors. In addition, unorganized
 workers in the informal sector fear the loss of their jobs if they exercise their right
 to criticize abuses, particularly in the agricultural sector.
 In general, a lack of public safety awareness, inadequate attention by unions, and
 lax enforcement by the Labor Ministry result in a high level of industrial accidents
 and unhealthy working conditions. Over 80 percent of industrial companies lack
 safety plans. The Social Security Institute reported 115,000 work-related accidents
 for 1995, 17,000 of which resulted in deaths. Informed observers reported that the
 level of work-related accidents was expected to remain at comparably high levels in
 1998, and that the industries most prone to worker accidents were mining, construc-
 tion, and transportation. According to the Labor Code, workers have the right to
 withdraw from a hazardous work situation without jeopardizing continued employ-
 ment.
