 MOZAMBIQUE
 Mozambique gained independence from Portugal in 1975 following
 a decade of guerrilla warfare waged by the Front for the
 Liberation of Mozambique (FRELIMO). The political bureau of
 FRELIMO, the only party allowed, is the key decisionmaking
 organ, and it articulates government policies. Following
 President Samora Machel's death in an aircraft crash October
 19, the Central Committee of FRELIMO elected Foreign Minister
 Joaquim Chissano as the new President and head of FRELIMO. The
 President appointed a new Council of Ministers which is
 responsible for the day-to-day operations of the Government.
 The security forces include the military, the People's Forces
 for the Liberation of Mozambique (FPLM); and the Mozambican
 Security Service (SNASP). A self-proclaimed nonaligned,
 nationalist, and Marxist-Leninist party at independence,
 FRELIMO's approach is increasingly pragmatic, aimed at dealing
 with the economic and political realities of catastrophic
 drought and growing civil war, which together have uprooted
 thousands of people, destroyed much of the economic and social
 infrastructure, and caused widespread casualties.
 Since the late 1970's the Mozambican National Resistance
 (RENAMO) has waged an increasingly violent guerrilla war
 against the Government. The insurgents' preferred target is
 the economic infrastructure, but their tactics have resulted in
 the deaths of thousands of civilians. Little is known about
 its popular support or its political aims, but RENAMO claims to
 have 20,000 troops, and in the past 2 years it has become
 active in all Mozambican provinces. Originally RENAMO was the
 creation of Ian Smith's Rhodesian regime; more recently, it has
 received extensive support from South Africa. The Government
 has responded to the growing insurgency by applying aggressive
 security measures of its own and seeking diplomatic and
 military help from neighboring states, principally Zimbabwe,
 which in December 1986 had over 6,000 combat troops in
 Mozambique. Earlier, the Machel Government attempted to cut
 off South African assistance to RENAMO through the March 1984,
 Nkomati Accord with South Africa which committed both countries
 to cease hostile acts against the other and to search for ways
 to increase economic cooperation. At the end of 1986,
 President Chissano accused South Africa of airlifting supplies
 to RENAMO forces in violation of this nonaggression pact. On
 the economic front, to meet the growing threat of famine and
 spiraling inflation, the Government turned to the West for food
 aid and economic assistance, and the President announced he
 would institute a major economic "austerity" program.
 Against this background, the overall human rights situation
 deteriorated in 1986 due to the insurgency. By the end of
 1986, nearly 1 million Mozambicans of a population of 14
 million had fled either to the cities or to neighboring
 countries. In September alone, over 400,000 persons were
 displaced. In addition to abuses by RENAMO forces, FPLM and
 SNASP forces committed excesses against civilians. There have
 been no reports of public and summary executions by the
 Government since 1983, but there are continuing allegations of
 torture by both guerrilla and government forces.
 Despite the difficult circumstances, the first elections since
 1977 took place between August 15 and December 15, 1986, to
 choose representatives to local, district, provincial, and
 national people's assemblies. The elections were held within
 the framework of the country's one-party system.

 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom From:
 a. Political Killing
 The continuing war between the Government and RENAMO has led to
 the death of many Mozambicans as well as a number of foreign
 civilians. Precise figures are unavailable, and both sides
 exaggerate accusations against each other. The total number of
 fatalities over the past few years is certainly in the
 thousands. The insurgents in particular have been brutally
 violent, mutilating, killing, maiming, and kidnaping their
 victims. For example, according to reliable reports, RENAMO
 ambushed a commercial bus in February, killing 7 unarmed
 civilians and wounding 20. RENAMO also killed a number of
 civilians during August and September, apparently in an effort
 to impede the electoral process through intimidation. RENAMO
 has charged, however, that on several occasions FRELIMO forces
 perpetrated killings of civilians and then blamed the killings
 on RENAMO. In addition, there is a large gray area involving
 killings by actual bandits or renegade FPLM or RENAMO
 personnel, such as in 1986 actions in Matola, Machava, and
 Catembe near Maputo. Indiscipline among both RENAMO and FPLM
 forces remains a major problem. The Government has continued
 aggressive efforts to combat RENAMO, and government military
 operations have reportedly resulted in the killing of civilians
 in contested areas.
 Amnesty International's 1986 Report (covering 1985) notes that
 it had received reports of killings and mutilations of captives
 by both government and opposition forces. The Council of
 Catholic Bishops in Mozambique has publicly decried the
 violence perpetrated against the civilian population by both
 sides. In 1986 the Government halted public execution of
 insurgents and those convicted of economic sabotage or other
 crimes against the State.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no confirmed reports of government-perpetrated
 disappearances. However, the Government's commitment to the
 prompt notification of relatives and friends of detained
 persons remains suspect, and it is often impossible to know
 whether a person has disappeared or is in detention. Security
 forces, operating under security legislation, sometimes hold
 detainees incommunicado for extended periods, despite the fact
 that detainees have the legal right to contact their relatives
 and to receive visitors. The Government's observance of this
 right improved in 1986, mainly due to President Machel's public
 campaign in 1985 to safeguard the legal rights of detainees.
 RENAMO has reportedly abducted thousands of rural villagers and
 continued these kidnapings throughout 1986. Some of these
 people were released after being required to transport
 materials or perform other tasks. Others were held permanently
 in  rural areas outside of formal government control. RENAMO
 also increased the kidnaping of foreigners, but in August it
 released 5 Portuguese and Italian nuns, and in December another
 65 hostages. RENAMO's seizure of foreign personnel seriously
 stymied U.N. and other donor food relief efforts.

 MOZAMBIQUE
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 In the early years after independence, according to numerous
 reports, political prisoners at remote government-organized
 1reeducation camps" were brutally bound, beaten, and often
 killed. These camps were used to intern political prisoners
 and "antisocial elements." Starting in 1979, however, the
 Government promulgated laws establishing a formal judicial
 system. In 1981 President Machel declared that henceforth no
 one would be sent to a reeducation camp without due process.
 Also in 1981, the President launched the "offensive for
 legality," which led, inter alia, to the firing of a number of
 security and defense force members for abusing prisoners.
 Most observers believe there were fewer instances of torture in
 1986, thus maintaining a downward trend. Nevertheless, there
 were new reports in 1986 of capricious and cruel treatment by
 some members of the security and defense forces. Amnesty
 International's 1986 Report noted that harsh beatings,
 inflicted with a variety of instruments, were the most
 frequently reported form of torture in 1985. In this
 connection, the Government reintroduced the practice of
 flogging (for example as punishment for economic crimes), and
 flogging is used extensively in rural areas where incarceration
 is difficult. Ministry of Justice officials have publicly
 condemned excessive and illegal floggings.
 According to numerous reports, including Amnesty
 International's 1986 Report, RENAMO has tortured, maimed, and
 mistreated both military prisoners and civilians.  A
 frequently reported RENAMO technique is to cut off the noses,
 ears, and lips of civilians believed by the insurgents to
 sympathize with the Government. Thousands of Mozambicans have
 undergone such disfigurement.
 Prisons in Mozambique are generally overcrowded and marked
 by inadequate food, hygiene, and medical care. The Government
 has sought foreign assistance to improve prison conditions.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Since 1979 two separate legal systems have existed. One is the
 regular civil/criminal system composed of the judiciary
 (courts) and a police force under the authority of the Ministry
 of the Interior. The other, characterized in its initiating
 legislation as transitional, is the military-run State Security
 System, which incorporates the Ministry of National Security
 (SNASP). This latter system, established to deal with the
 growing armed insurgency, has jurisdiction over both political
 and economic (sabotage) crimes against the State. These two
 systems operate separately and are subject to separate controls.
 Under the State Security System, all investigations and arrests
 are carried out by SNASP, and detainees may be held
 indefinitely, often incommunicado, without formal charges.
 SNASP has the power to conduct pretrial inquiries without
 reference to an investigating judge. Amnesty International has
 recommended that SNASP's power to detain persons be drastically
 reduced because such unlimited authority invites abuse and
 leads to prisoner mistreatment. There are no reliable
 estimates of the numbers of persons detained for political
 reasons. Amnesty International estimated that there were
 approximately 4,000 to 5,000 RENAMO detainees at the beginning
 of 1986, a figure the Government has publicly acknowledged.
 
 
 212
 MOZAMBIQUE
 Under the regular civil/criminal court system, persons accused
 of the most serious crimes can be detained up to 84 days
 without investigation, and then such detainees can be held for
 two additional periods of 84 days with the approval of the
 court while the police complete their investigation. While
 being held for investigation, a detainee has the right to
 counsel and to contact relatives or friends. In practice,
 these procedures are not always followed, and legal counsel is
 frequently not available. In some cases, detainees may be
 released from prison while the investigation proceeds, but the
 bail system in Mozambique remains ill-defined. If the
 prescribed period for investigation has been completed and no
 charges have been brought, the detainee must be released.
 In 1985, as part of the "offensive for legality," the
 Government set up a judicial inspectorate to help supervise the
 administration of courts and prisons. During 1986 the Ministry
 of Justice continued its effort to ensure that detainees held
 by police were afforded access to government-provided legal
 assistance. The Ministry of Justice also launched programs to
 publicize basic laws and the rights of defendants, families,
 and children, and to conduct seminars on human rights
 throughout the country. During 1986 there were no reports of
 anyone being exiled from Mozambique.
 As far as is known, compulsory labor is not practiced in
 Mozambique, although RENAMO reportedly uses captive labor to
 carry out supply and other support functions.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Nonpolitical trials conducted by the regular civil/criminal
 court system are generally fair and are held in public. At the
 local level they are often conducted in a public place in the
 village where the crime was allegedly committed to encourage
 public attendance and participation. The proceedings are
 conducted by a trained representative of the Ministry of
 Justice, assisted by two or four popularly elected "judges."
 Since the legal knowledge of those involved is limited, they
 are instructed to exercise common sense and to apply locally
 accepted principles. These courts can handle only minor
 offenses; more serious crimes are judged in People's Courts at
 the district and provincial levels. District and provincial
 trials are also open to the public, except in certain cases
 such as rape, where the defendant can request a closed trial.
 Persons convicted of a serious crime have the automatic right
 of appeal to the next higher court. There is a Superior Court
 of Appeals in Maputo.
 Prisoners charged with crimes against the State are tried by
 the Revolutionary Military Tribunal. These trials are held in
 camera, and there is no recourse of appeal. In general,
 treatment of RENAMO prisoners is not known. However, there is
 a model prison for them in Inhambane where they receive
 training in various skills. The length of detention of such
 prisoners is not known.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 While the party apparatus is a vehicle for monitoring daily
 life, in practice there is no gross interference with family
 affairs. However, especially in areas of active insurgency,
 homes are entered at will by security or police forces. It is
 widely assumed that surveillance devices are employed to
 
 
 213
 MOZAMBIQUE
 monitor the local and international telecommunications
 systems. There have also been reports of tampering with mail,
 especially mail from abroad. Regular foreign broadcasts are
 received without interference, and there is no official
 restriction on listening to them.
 While people are not forced to belong to FRELIMO, there is an
 obvious correlation between professional advancement and party
 membership. Nonparty members are also occasionally compelled
 to attend political indoctrination meetings where they work or
 live, although in most private firms such meetings apparently
 cannot be called without the consent of the employer.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 There is little tolerance for public criticism of basic
 government policies and officials at the national level. At
 the local level, especially in rural areas, there is greater
 openness as the people express their views on prevailing
 conditions. In a public meeting in Matola, for example,
 residents criticized the armed forces for lack of security at
 night.
 The Government exerts either tacit or de facto control over all
 authorized publications in the country, ranging from the radio
 and experimental television facilities to the nominally
 independent daily Noticias. Although the media promote the
 Government's general philos6phy and its positions on issues,
 there is controlled reporting on abuses within the system or
 flaws in the implementation of government policies in those
 areas where the Government has admitted to errors or wishes to
 initiate changes. Magazines and newspapers frequently contain
 articles or letters to the editor complaining about the lack of
 goods and social services or the ineffectiveness of a
 particular official. During August and September, the media
 reported a number of critical exchanges between local electoral
 candidates and voters.
 Western journalists (including Americans) are welcome in
 Mozambique, and the Government generally works to make their
 visits productive.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Political opposition to the Government and to FRELIMO is not
 permitted. Public meetings other than purely social or
 recreational gatherings are controlled by the local
 authorities. The right of Mozambicans to come together to form
 voluntary associations is limited; local economic cooperatives
 and social organizations such as sporting groups are
 encouraged, but politically oriented associations are
 proscribed. The Government has organized several "mass
 movements" for women, youth, workers, etc., and utilizes them
 to motivate and receive "feedback" from the general population.
 There are also several professional associations, such as the
 Mozambican writers' association, which are linked to the
 party. Although membership in these organizations is
 theoretically voluntary, there is occasional pressure to join.
 The formation of independent labor unions is not permitted, and
 strikes are forbidden. In 1983 the Government established the
 Mozambique Workers' Organization which was intended to function
 as a national labor union under FRELIMO guidance. An
 
 
 214
 MOZAMBIQUE
 independent organized union movement has yet to develop, and
 the Mozambique Worker's Organization has little influence on
 economic policy or politics. There are occasional exchanges of
 delegations in the labor field with other countries, most often
 with Eastern European countries, but also with Western nations,
 including the United States.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Although the Constitution guarantees freedom of religion and
 separation of church and state, the Government has placed
 restrictions on the activities of religious groups. It
 reserves the right to decide whether individual church
 buildings can be utilized and has nationalized church schools
 and hospitals. However, the improvement in church/state
 relations which began several years ago continued in 1986, and
 organized religions now operate without official harassment.
 Pastoral letters issued in 1986 by the Catholic bishops which
 were critical of governmental policies circulated widely
 without reprisals by the authorities. In addition, the
 government-published TEMPO magazine contained two articles
 which dealt with the productive role played by Protestant
 churches recently in Mozambican society. Some churches are
 effective in social work and in acting as channels for the
 distribution of emergency food donations to the poorest regions
 of the country.
 Although the Government reserves the right to decide whether
 individual clergy can visit outlying areas, it usually allows
 such travel in connection with pastoral duties; most churches
 are open, and services are well attended. The Muslims have
 also been allowed to establish a national organization, resume
 religious training, reopen mosques, and send groups on
 pilgrimages to Mecca. Party members are no longer specifically
 prohibited from membership in a church or mosque. Critical
 comments regarding religious beliefs by the Government are
 almost always general in nature and not directed against
 specific individuals or churches.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Travel and relocation within the country are controlled by
 security and employment requirements under the rationale of
 assuring public and social order. The insurgency makes travel
 in some areas, particularly in the central provinces of Tete,
 Zambezia, and Sofala, very difficult. Mozambicans planning to
 travel outside their place of residence must obtain a travel
 permit from local government authorities. In practice, this
 system is not always enforced, especially with regard to travel
 within the general vicinity of one's residence.
 Mozambican law does not address the issue of emigration, but in
 practice Mozambicans can emigrate if they wish. Several
 hundred thousand people fled from Mozambique at independence in
 1975 because of economic chaos and fear of political
 persecution. In recent years, more than 350,000 persons have
 fled across borders to neighboring countries, due mainly to the
 intensification of the guerrilla war within the central
 provinces and the scarcity of food caused by the war and the
 prolonged drought which ended only last year. Some of these
 people have since returned, but there are still extensive
 numbers of Mozambican refugees in neighboring countries. Since
 1981 the Government has had a policy of welcoming back
 Mozambicans who left the country, and a 1982 law allows for the
 
 
 215
 MOZAMBIQUE
 reacquisition of citizenship by Mozambicans who left the
 country and assumed another nationality. Previously, some
 Mozambicans who had opposed the party before independence were
 jailed upon their return to Mozambique. Such imprisonment
 remains a possibility, but Mozambicans who in 1986 accepted the
 Government's invitation to return apparently have not suffered
 harassment or retribution. Supporters of the insurgency or
 outspoken critics of the Government generally have opted not to
 return to Mozambique.
 Since independence, the Government has readily provided asylum
 to refugees from neighboring countries. Many thousands of
 Zimbabweans resided temporarily in Mozambique during the
 struggle for that country's independence. Most refugees now in
 Mozambique are from South Africa and Malawi. Since signing the
 Nkomati Accord in 1984, the Government has restricted the entry
 of members and supporters of the African National Congress.
 Despite the poor economic situation, the Government continues
 to assist refugees by providing land, housing, relief
 assistance, social services, and in some cases, employment.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 No organized political opposition to FRELIMO is allowed. The
 party and the Government are controlled by a small cadre of
 senior officials in the politburo. So-called mass political
 involvement exists at the provincial, district, and local
 levels but only within political organizations sanctioned by
 FRELIMO. Votes by the National People's Assembly endorsing
 government policies are usually unanimous.
 The party and Government espouse a system of "People's
 Democracy" whereby decisions are theoretically made by
 consensus; in practice, this means that policies and
 initiatives emanate from above. The electoral process is
 closely controlled by the party. The first national elections
 since 1977 for people's assemblies at the local, district,
 provincial, and national levels were held from August 15 to
 December 15. The party drew up single slates of candidates for
 the elections, and local party structures reviewed these slates
 with the local population prior to the election. Voters at the
 village level then physically assembled to vote on the
 candidates, and often had some degree of choice since there
 were, by law, 20 percent more candidates than seats available
 in the various assemblies. In addition, several dozen
 candidates were rejected by the voters at various election
 meetings, and some of those elected were not party members.
 Balloting for district, city, and national assemblies was
 indirect, but was conducted by secret ballot.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Although the Government has discussed the status of RENAMO
 prisoners with international relief organizations, including
 the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), it has not
 yet allowed them access. At a major ICRC meeting in Geneva in
 October, Mozambique was cited as one of only six countries that
 refuses to allow ICRC access to prisoners. Amnesty
 International has presented to the Government recommendations
 to strengthen the controls against torture and to limit the
 right of the security forces to hold detainees for unlimited
 time without charge, but these recommendations have had no
 
 
 216
 MOZAMBIQUE
 apparent impact on government policies. In a few cases,
 however, the Government has been responsive to private
 inquiries on specific detainee cases.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 In spite of the strains imposed by the war and the economic
 collapse, racial harmony generally remains a hallmark of
 Mozambican society. The number of ethnic Asian and white
 Mozambicans holding important positions is much greater than
 their proportion of the general population, a reflection of the
 greater educational opportunities available to these groups
 prior to independence rather than to unequal treatment. While
 it is true that the majority of the FRELIMO leadership are
 members of the southern-based Shangaan tribe, within the black
 population of Mozambique individual ethnic groups are treated
 relatively equally by the Government and enjoy constitutionally
 rooted legal equality. RENAMO, however, tries to exploit what
 it perceives to be historically based Mozambican intertribal
 antipathies to appeal to other tribes.
 Largely due to government support, women are playing an
 increasingly important role in Mozambique, particularly at the
 working levels of government. The 1985 National Congress of
 the party-affiliated Mozambican's Women's Organization was
 notable for its avoidance of ideology and its concentration on
 issues of direct relevance to women.
 CONDITIONS OF LABOR
 The Government has continued efforts to safeguard the health
 and welfare of the population. Health and environmental laws
 protecting workers have been enacted, and the Government has on
 occasion closed down firms for noncompliance. Recent
 government legislation provides for the right of 60 days
 maternity leave. If firms have day-care facilities, women
 reportedly have the right to 2 half-hour breaks daily for a
 year to feed their children. The legislation reportedly
 contains other job-related safeguards for pregnant women and
 new mothers. Child labor is also controlled, and the minimum
 working age (excluding agriculture) is 16. The minimum wage
 for the wage labor sector is approximately $64 per month but is
 woefully inadequate, given the shortage of food and consumer
 goods and the high rate of inflation. The Government has been
 examining the issue of wages, and an increase in wages is
 expected to be part of an economic reform process which the
 Government has launched.
 Until recently labor law in Mozambique was generally favorable
 to the employee. However, the Government has enacted a
 comprehensive labor law that increases the autonomy of
 employers. Among other things, it allows both public and
 private firms to fire employees without obtaining governmental
 permission. Companies may now also reward their best workers
 with bonuses and penalize less productive employees.
