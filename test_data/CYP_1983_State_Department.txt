 CYPRUS
 Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkish military
 intervention followed a coup d'etat directed from Greece which
 brought down the elected government of President Makarios.
 Since that time, the Government of Cyprus has been able to
 exercise full control over only about two-thirds of the
 country's territory. About one-third of Cyprus is governed by
 an autonomous administration that since 1975 had used the name
 "Turkish Federated State of Cyprus" and is supported by the
 presence of Turkish military units. On November 15, 1983, this
 administration declared its independence as the "Turkish
 Cypriot Republic" which neither the United States nor any other
 country (except Turkey) had recognized by the end of 1983. The
 Turkish intervention of 1974 caused an uprooting of the larger
 Greek Cypriot population from areas now under Turkish Cypriot
 control, as well as the smaller Turkish Cypriot population in
 the Greek Cypriot-controlled south. Both involved loss of
 homes and means of livelihood. The Greek Cypriots point to
 these displacements, as well as the unwillingness of the
 Turkish Cypriot authorities to allow resettlement of Greek
 Cypriots in the north, as the fundamental human rights question
 in Cyprus today. The Turkish Cypriots assert that the 1974
 intervention was legal and point to human rights violations
 they suffered under the system existing before 1974. The
 subsequent regrouping of the two communities in separate parts
 of the island, according to Turkish Cypriots, was necessary for
 their security and for the eventual establishment of a federal
 structure of government for both communities.
 The major problems related to human rights are unresolved
 property ownership matters, the difficulty of travel between
 the sectors of the island, and the absence of freedom of
 settlement--issues whose resolution was a major purpose of the
 recently interrupted intercommunal talks. The future of these
 talks is very much unclear in light of the November 15, 1983,
 Turkish Cypriot declaration of statehood.
 These human rights problems in Cyprus remain from previous
 years. Future human rights improvements in Cyprus will be
 dependent upon the ability of both parties to negotiate their
 differences and to agree on a basis for coexistence.
 Despite these unresolved issues, both the Government of Cyprus
 and the Turkish Cypriot administration are democratic systems
 based on free elections which guarantee basic human rights, in
 theory and in practice. Both Cypriot economies are based on
 the free enterprise system with stress on private initiative
 and private ownership of property, although the Turkish Cypriot
 economy provides a far greater role for state enterprises.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section I Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Unlawful or Arbitrary Deprivation of Life
 There have been no reports of the unlawful or arbitrary
 deprivation of life in Cyprus since the violence that
 accompanied the events of 1974.
 (951)
 
 30-231 0 - 84 - 61
 
 
 952
 b. Disappearance
 There are no post-1974 reports of persons abducted, secretly
 arrested, or held in clandestine detention. However, as a
 result of the 1963-74 intercommunal troubles and the events of
 1974, the issue of missing persons from those conflicts remains
 a source of dispute between the Greek Cypriot and Turkish
 Cypriot communities. A Committee on Missing Persons was
 established under the auspices of the U.N. Secretary General in
 1981 to deal with the problem, but its activities have been
 suspended since February 1982 because of procedural
 disagreements.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Both the Cyprus Constitution and the basic document governing
 the Turkish Cypriot community specifically prohibit torture.
 Freedom from cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or
 punishment is guaranteed by law in both communities. There
 have been no reports that these abuses are permitted or
 practiced by the Cyprus Government or the Turkish Cypriot
 administration. Adequate health care is provided in prison and
 detention facilities, and diet is considered normal. Family
 members may visit those in detention at any interval that is
 not deemed as impeding an investigation. Once sentenced,
 prisoners may be visited by family members once a month, or
 more frequently where humanitarian needs exist. Attorneys may
 visit prisoners freely.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Freedom from arbitrary arrest and detention is guaranteed by
 law and respected in practice by both the Government of Cyprus
 and Turkish Cypriot authorities. The right of habeas corpus is
 observed. Preventive detention does not exist in law, nor has
 it been reported in practice. No individual may be held for
 more than three days for investigation of a crime without
 referral of the case to a court for extension of the period of
 detention. Most periods of investigative detention do not
 exceed eight or 10 days before formal charges are filed. No
 instance of exile was reported. There are no political
 prisoners on Cyprus.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 In both communities, fair, public trial is guaranteed by
 law.    The judiciary is independent of executive or military
 control. Cases are generally tried before a judge or panel of
 judges, although a request for a jury trial is usually
 granted. There are no special courts to deal with security or
 political offenses. Civilians are not tried by military courts.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Both the Cyprus Constitution and the basic document governing
 the Turkish Cypriot community provide guarantees protecting the
 individual against arbitrary interference: a judicial warrant
 is required, for example, for an official to enter a private
 residence. Abuses of privacy run counter to the liberal and
 democratic traditions of both communities. However, Turkish
 Cypriots complain that mail is delayed, opened, or not
 delivered.
 
 
 953
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 These rights are guaranteed by law and are widely and freely
 practiced. The press is free throughout the island, and it
 represents the entire political spectrum. Opposition papers
 frequently criticize both the governing authorities and their
 own leadership. There is no press censorship, although
 journalists in both communities usually stay away from overt
 criticism of their respective "mother countries."
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 All groups have the right to organize and hold meetings. Labor
 unions are active in both communities. They have the right to
 strike, and they participate actively in the political process.
 c. Freedom of Peligion
 While freedom of religion exists in Cyprus, the Greek Orthodox
 Church in the south has the character of a state institution
 due to the historical role of the leader of the church, the
 ethnarch, as the spiritual leader of his people. The remaining
 non-Muslims in the north are the members of the Christian
 Maronite minority, a small number of remaining Greek Cypriots,
 and foreign residents, all of whom can freely practice their
 religion. There is no discrimination against adherents of
 minority religions nor discrimination based on membership or
 lack of membership in a particular faith. Approximately 100
 Turkish Cypriot Muslims remain in the south and are allowed to
 practice their religion freely.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel,
 Emigration, and Repatriation
 Turkish Cypriots and Greek Cypriots enjoy general freedom of
 movement within their respective areas. However, the Turkish
 military does impose restrictions on the rights of movement and
 settlement in areas adjoining military camps and near the
 U.N.-controlled cease-fire line. Travel into the
 Turkish-controlled area is under the ultimate supervision of
 the Turkish military. Greeks and Greek Cypriots are barred
 from entry except for a small number of humanitarian cases.
 Turkish Cypriots, except for emergency medical cases and
 journalists on an approved assignment, are also restricted from
 visiting the south. Greek Cypriots still residing in the north
 (about 1,000) and Maronites (about 500) are usually allowed to
 travel to the south after making an application, although there
 have been occasional allegations of arbitrary denial of these
 applications.
 Turkish Cypriot authorities restrict the entry into their
 sector of foreigners coming from the south, insisting on
 48-hour notice by visitors intending to travel outside of
 Nicosia. Foreign journalists arriving from the south are
 normally forbidden entry unless accompanied by an employee of
 the Turkish Cypriot Public Information Office.
 The Government of Cyprus also restricts freedom of movement by
 visitors to and from the north. Because the Government has
 declared the use of ports not under its control to be illegal,
 any foreigner arriving through a Turkish Cypriot-controlled
 port may be denied entry to the south. Foreigners intending to
 
 
 954
 transit through the north to Turkey may also be denied exit
 from territory controlled by the Government of Cyprus. Citing
 a law that makes it illegal to use hotels taken over from their
 Greek Cypriot owners in 1974, the Government forbids tourists
 to stay overnight in the north. Journalists from the north
 were denied entry to the south on October 1, 1983, Independence
 Day. These restrictions on movement across the "green line"
 may be modified following the recent declaration of Turkish
 Cypriot statehood.
 The right to travel abroad and to emigrate is observed,
 although individuals facing military service or legal action in
 either community-may not be allowed to travel. Turkish
 Cypriots also have difficulty in traveling to some countries
 because their travel documents, issued by the "Turkish
 Federated State of Cyprus," or by its successor are not
 recognized by most countries (including the U.S.). Citizens
 may repatriate freely, although both Greek Cypriots and Turkish
 Cypriots returning from long stays abroad may be liable for
 military service if this obligation previously has not been
 met. A small number of refugees from Turkey and Eastern Europe
 sometimes come to Cyprus and are usually sent on to third
 countries as soon as arrangements for their resettlement can be
 made.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to
 Change Their Government
 Both the Government of Cyprus and the administration of the
 Turkish Cypriot community are democratically elected by their
 people. They have lively multiparty political systems in which
 parties, actively and without restriction, compete for popular
 support. Greek Cypriots and Maronites living in the north do
 not participate in Turkish Cypriot elections, but elect their
 own village officials. Women are less active in politics than
 men in both north and south although this is due to custom
 rather than any legal impediment. No women in the north and
 only one in the south are Members of Parliament, nor are there
 currently any women of ministerial rank in the north or the
 south. One woman was previously a Minister in the Republic of
 Cyprus Government, and two women currently serve as Under
 Secretaries in the Turkish Cypriot sector.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Cyprus participates actively in the work of the U.N. Commission
 on Human Rights. For several years the question of human
 rights in Cyprus, as it relates to the events of 1974, has been
 on the Commission's agenda but, by agreement of the parties
 directly concerned, has been regularly postponed. However, the
 still unresolved question of missing persons has been raised by
 the Greek Cypriot Government, which alleges that some 2,000
 Greek Cypriots have remained unaccounted for after the events
 of 1974. Turkey and the Turkish Cypriots claim that these
 individuals are dead and that no prisoners are being held from
 1974. The issue is still unresolved, and a Committee on
 Missing Persons, established under U.N. auspices in 1981, has
 not met since February 1982, when it adjourned sine die because
 of procedural differences. Representatives of international
 human rights organizations have open access to both the south
 and the north. Five European representatives of Amnesty
 International visited the island in the summer of 1983.
 
 
 955
 Amnesty International did not discuss Cyprus in its 1983
 Report. Freedom House rates the Greek Cypriot portion "free,"
 while it rates the Turkish portion "partly free" because of the
 Turkish military occupation.
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 Per capita gross national product (GNP) in the
 Government-controlled area of Cyprus was $3,650 in 1981, and
 current estimates place it over the $4,100 level. The Greek
 Cypriot economy is free enterprise oriented, with only a
 modicum of government participation or regulation. The economy
 is based on manufacturing, trade, tourism and services,
 construction, and agriculture, with manufacturing contributing
 most to the GNP. The Turkish Cypriot economy is closely linked
 to that of Turkey and is a mixture of state-owned and private
 enterprises. It suffers from problems similar to those in
 Turkey, including high inflation, low investment, and
 significant underemployment.
 Food, shelter, education, and health care are available to
 members of both communities regardless of race, religion,
 ethnic background, or political opinion. Both societies are
 essentially middle class, with a small but prominent wealthy
 segment. Housing is adequate and is available for displaced
 persons. Most Cypriots are covered by a National Health
 Service scheme organized by their respective authorities.
 Illiteracy is virtually unknown among persons below the age of
 55. Turkish Cypriot authorities in the past three years have
 been making efforts to eradicate remaining illiteracy in that
 community, mainly among the older population.
 In each community, the legal status of women is identical to
 that of men. However, custom has retarded the full
 participation of women in all aspects of public life.
 Politics, for example, has traditionally been a male preserve
 in both communities. Through changing attitudes and increasing
 contact with the outside world, however, women are experiencing
 increasing mobility.
