 FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF GERMANY
 
 West Germans are acutely conscious of the central impor-
 tance of human rights and civil liberties because of
 still-living memories of the atrocities of the Nazi
 period, the mass uprooting of millions of Germans from
 their homes at the end of World War II, the division of
 Germany and resultant division of families, and the
 presence of ethnic Germans in the communist countries of
 Eastern Europe and the USSR who wish either to emigrate
 to the West or to enjoy more cultural autonomy. There
 is among West Germans broad fundamental agreement on the
 need to preserve human rights within the Federal Republic
 and to promote human rights in Europe. Basic human
 rights are provided for in the Constitution (Basic Law)
 of 1949 and they are scrupulously protected.
 Terrorist incidents perpetrated by individuals from
 within West Germany's own society have posed a particu-.
 larly difficult problem for the Federal Republic since
 the early 1970's. While the political, economic, social
 and psychological causes of German terrorism are not
 clear, the terrorists have made clear their anarchistic
 aim of destroying the constitutional structure and
 democratic values of the Federal Republic. The Govern-
 ment has taken special care to safeguard basic civil
 liberties of individuals while taking measures to combat
 violence and terrorism. The need to preserve the
 delicate balance between internal security requirements
 and civil liberties has been the overriding theme in
 West German public and parliamentary debate on specific
 anti-terrorist measures.
 The Federal Republic's attitude toward questions of human
 rights throughout the world is reflected in its economic
 assistance to developing countries and the vigorous human
 rights role it has played in the United Nations. The
 Federal Republic's human rights policy vis-a-vis the
 Soviet Union and Eastern Europe is based on a commitment
 to implementation of the Helsinki Final Act and continued
 efforts to facilitate the emigration of ethnic Germans
 from those areas.

 1.   Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 Freedom from torture is guaranteed by law and respected
 in practice.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Freedom from cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or
 punishment is guaranteed by law and respected in practice.
 Although three convicted terrorists filed protests con-
 cerning their solitary confinement and other prison
 conditions before the European Commission for Human
 Rights, the Commission determined in July 1978 that
 these complaints were not justified. Under legislation
 passed in October 1977, persons in custody suspected of
 involvement in a terrorist conspiracy may be denied any
 contacts with the outside world if 1) the accused is
 charged with involvement in a terrorist conspiracy, 2)
 there are grounds to believe that the conspiracy is
 being directed from the prison where the accused is in
 custody, and 3) there is present danger to life or
 health of a person (e.g., a hostage being held by
 terrorists). This "contact bar" is possible only for a
 maximum of fourteen days unless extended by a court.
 c. Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 Freedom from arbitrary arrest or imprisonment is guaran-
 teed by law and respected in practice.
 d. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Fair public trial is guaranteed by law and provided in
 practice. Legislation which entered into force in
 April 1978 provides for stricter controls of the printed
 material and other objects which a lawyer representing
 a terrorist in prison may take to his client. This was
 done to prevent the smuggling into prison of small arms
 and communications devices by certain lawyers, as had
 apparently occurred. Attorneys may be excluded from
 criminal cases involving persons suspected of terrorist
 
 
 458
 conspiracy if specific facts exist which support a sus-
 picion that the attorney is implicated in the conspiracy.
 This legislation does not, however, deny legal counsel
 to terrorist prisoners, who may either choose or be
 assigned other counsel not suspected of being implicated
 in the conspiracy.
 e. Invasion of the Home
 Freedom from invasion of the home is guaranteed by law
 and respected in practice.
 2.   Government Policies Relating to the Fulfillment of
 Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care and
 Education
 The Federal Republic provides extensive social security
 benefits, unemployment compensation, full health
 services and free education through the university level.
 Foreign residents in Germany, including foreign workers
 and their dependents, receive similar extensive benefits.
 3.   Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Includ-
 ing:
 a. Freedom of Thought, Speech, Press, Religion
 and Assembly
 Freedom of thought, speech, press, religion and assembly
 is firmly anchored in the Basic Law as part of a "bill
 of rights" protected in practice and not itself subject
 to constitutional amendment. In certain limited circum-
 stances, the Government may restrict the exercise of
 these liberties by those hostile to the democratic
 constitutional system. There is, for example, legisla-
 tion prohibiting distribution of written material which
 advocates criminal acts.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel and Emigration
 There is freedom of movement, foreign travel and emigration.

 The Federal Republic has been notably successful in
 facilitating emigration to the West of those wishing
 to leave the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe. It has
 permitted and helped to finance the resettlement of
 these people, as well as many refugees from other areas
 of the world (including over 3,000 Indochinese refugees),
 in West Germany.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Freedom to participate in the political process is
 protected. Radical political parties are permitted to
 participate in local, state and federal elections.
 Since some radical parties and groups aim at overthrowing
 the constitutional order, the federal and state govern-
 ments agreed in January 1972 on general principles to
 bar members of such parties and groups from civil
 service employment. However, the criteria for screening
 applicants for civil service are not uniformly adminis-
 tered in all states of the country and this issue has
 remained the subject of public debate. In a few cases,
 the application of the principles has barred persons
 from employment in civil service.
 4.   Government Attitude and Record Regarding Inter-
 national and Non-governmental Investigation of
 Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The Federal Republic of Germany was one of the first
 states to ratify, in 1952, the European Convention for
 the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms
 and to subject itself to the international controls
 exercised by the European Human Rights Commission and
 the European Court of Human Rights. Since that time,
 numerous individual complaints against the Federal
 Republic, among them complaints by terrorists, have
 been reviewed in judicial proceedings by the European-
 Commission on Human Rights. There has been only one
 case in which it was established that the Federal
 Republic had violated the Convention. (The Commission
 ruled in-the Koenig case, in June 1978, that the dura-
 .tion of proceedings in an administrative dispute was
 excessive.) The Federal Republic has also ratified the
 United Nations International Convenants on Political and
 Civil Rights and on Economic and Social Rights.
