 SWITZERLAND
 Switzerland is a constitutional democracy with a federal structure. Legislative
 power is vested in the bicameral Parliament. Given the nation's linguistic and reli-
 gious diversity, the Swiss political system emphasizes local and national political
 consensus andgrants considerable autonomy to individual cantons.

 Police duties are primarily a responsibility of the individual cantons, which have
 their own distinct police forces. The national police authority has a coordinating role
 and relies on the cantons for actual law enforcement. Both local and national police
 forces are subordinate and responsive to civilian authority.
 Switzerland has a free enterprise industrial and service economy highly depend-
 ent on international trade. There has been virtual full employment and labor peace
 for many years. The standard of living is one of the highest in the world.
 Human rights are widely respected. There were no major human rights problems
 during 1992. Switzerland maintained its own strong association with human rights
 issues, exemplified by its being host to the U.N. Human Rights Commission in Ge-
 neva.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no political killings.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of abductions or disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution prohibits such practices, and there were no reports of violations.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Freedom from arbitrary arrest, detention,
 or exile is provided by law. A detained person may not be held longer than 24 hours
 .'ithout a warrant of arrest issued by the magistrate conducting thc preliminary in-
 vestigation. A suspect must immediately be shown the warrant and has the right
 to contact legal counsel as soon as a warrant is issued. A suspect may be detained
 with a warrant until an investigation is completed, but the length of investigative
 detention is always reviewed by higher judicial authority, and investigations typi-
 cally are completed quickly. Release on personal recognizance or bail is granted un-
 less the examining magistrate believes the person is a danger to society or will not
 appear for trial. There is no summary exile, nor is exile used as a means of political
 control, although non-Swiss convicted of crimes may receive sentences that include
 denial of reentry for a specified period following completion of a prison sentence.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution provides for public trials. All
 courts of first instance are cantonal courts, with right of appeal to the federal courts
 and freedom from interference by other branches of government. Minor cases are
 tried by a single judge, difficult cases by a panel of judges, and murder or other
 serious crimes by a public jury. Even the most serious cases are usually brought
 to trial within a few months. There are no political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Famiy, Home, or Correspondence.-Police
 entry into the premises of a person suspected of a criminal offense is regulated by
 cantonal legislation. Regulations differ widely from canton to canton.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-An independent press, effective judiciary, and
 democratic political system combine to ensure freedom of speech and press. Groups
 or associations determined to be a potential threat to the State may have restric-
 tions placed on their freedom of speech and press, but no groups are restricted at
 the present time. Broadcast media are government funded but possess editorial au-
 tonomy, and foreign broadcast media are freely available. Press and publishing are
 private enterprises operated without government intervention. Academic freedom is
 respected.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The only restriction on peace-
 ful assembly and association is a requirement to obtain permits from police authori-
 ties before holding public meetings. These are routinely granted unless authorities
 have reason to believe the meeting will lead to violence.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-Switzerland enjoys religious freedom. There is no single
 state church, but individual cantons may support a particular church out of public
 funds, and most cantons do so. Foreign clergy are free to perform their duties in
 Switzerland. The degree to which minority religious rights are explicitly recognized
 in law varies among the cantons.
 The legal requirement for universal male military service provides no exemption
 for conscientious objectors. They may apply for military service which does not en-
 tail bearing arms, but refusal to serve has nearly always led to prosecution and con-
 viction. A new law, which took effect in July 1991, maintains that refusal to serve
 is a punishable offense, but if the refusal stems from reasons of conscience, the pre-
 scribed sentence is a period of alternative community service (up to a maximum of
 1V2 years and entailing no criminal record) rather than prison. Those objecting to
 military service on grounds of conscience which are not recognized by the military
 tribunals (such as political grounds) and those failing to convince the tribunals that
 
 
 their refusal to perform military service is based on fundamental ethical values
 which are irreconcilable with military service continue to receive prison sentences
 and a criminal record.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.--Swiss citizens are free to travel in or outside the country and can emi-
 grate without difficulty. Switzerland traditionally has been a haven for refugees, but
 public concern over the growing number of asylum-seekers, many of whom come for
 economic reasons, generated pressure on the government to implement swifter proc-
 essing of asylum-seekers and expel more quickly those whose applications are re-
 jected. Asylum-seekers continue to receive orderly consideration, and those whose
 applications are rejected are allowed to stay temporarily if their home country is
 torn by war or insurrection.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Switzerland is a highly developed constitutional democracy. There is universal
 adult suffrage by secret ballot in federal elections. There is universal adult suffrage
 in cantonal elections as well, but a few half-cantons still retain the traditional "as-
 sembly of the people" style of voting by raising hands rather than by secret ballot.
 Elections are free and contested actively by four major national parties and at
 least a dozen significant regional or minor parties. Initiative and referendum proce-
 dures provide unusually intense popular involvement in the legislative process.
 Participation by women in politics has been limited historically but continues to
 expand slowly. Psychological, social, and economic barriers still obtain for most
 women who would participate at the top levels of national political life. Although
 Swiss women have had the vote for only 21 years, they currently hold about 16 per-
 cent of the seats in Parliament. The current President of the Council of States is
 a woman, as is the head of a small independent political party. In 1991 the presi-
 dent of the Christian Democratic Party-one of the four major parties-was a
 woman. Women are currently members of some cantonal executive councils. Women
 are also gradually achieving leadership positions in some federal departments. For
 example, the Department of Foreign Affairs currently has three female ambas-
 sadors.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Human rights advocacy groups in Switzerland concern themselves almost exclu-
 sively with lobbying the Swiss and other governments about human rights situa-
 tions in other countries. Switzerland cooperates with international and nongovern-
 mental groups in all areas of human rights. All major international human rights
 _grups are active in Switzerland, and some of the leading ones, such as the United
 Nations Human Rights Commission and the International Committee of the Red
 Cross (ICRC), are based there. The ICRC is made up of Swiss nationals, and Swiss
 play prominent roles in other humanitarian nongovernmental organizations.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Language, or Social Status
 Although the Constitution prohibits discrimination against women in the work-
 place, government and other sources noted that further implementation is necessary
 to ensure equal pay and other benefits for women. The discrimination that persists
 today, primarily social rather than legal, still delays to some extent the movement
 of women into traditional male occupations. Nevertheless, a significant number of
 women in recent years have broken the barriers into traditional male-dominated
 professions, such as medicine, law, and engieering.
 Differences in the treatment of men and women is most pronounced in the sala-
 ries and wages paid. Despite the statutory requirement of equal pay for equivalent
 work, women's wages lag behind those of men in some cases by 30 percent. The
 Government has said it plans amendments to the law on sex equality which would
 forbid discrimination in employment, improve protection aigainst dismissals, reverse
 the burden of proof in discihmnation cases, and thus facilitate law suits by individ-
 ual women against discriminatory employers.
 Swiss policymakers have become aware in recent years of the issue of violence
 against women. Observers believe that many casesgo unreported, so that accurate
 statistics are lacking. There is, however, widespread agreement that a problem ex-
 ists. The Federation of Women's Organizations and other women's advocacy groups
 have heightened public consciousness. Each city has an emergency telephone num-
 ber through which women who are victims of violence can obtainhelp and counsel-
 ing. Specialists work with police authorities to interview women who report attacks.
 Laws exist against wife beating and similar crimes. Parliament approved a change
 in the PenalCode effective October 1, explicitly making spousal rape a criminal of-
 
 
 922
 
 fense. In addition, new legislation on assistance for victims of violent crimes will
 enter into force January 1, 1993. Both of these measures also contain provisions ex-
 plicitly protecting children from such abuses. It is not yet clear what effect these
 new laws will have on deterring violence against women or children. While the
 Penal Code is established at the federal level, enforcement is the responsibility of
 the cantons. Thus, variations in enforcement can occur. In 1992 the Federal Govern-
 ment also undertook a comprehensive study of violence against women.
 Italian and Romansch linguistic minorities (respectively about 10 and 1 percent
 of the population) express concern that the limited resources made available to them
 by the Federal Government endanger the continued intellectual vitality of these lan-
 guages. The Federal Government s policy is to ensure through apportionment of
 funds that all linguistic groups can carry out cultural activities in their own lan-
 guAthough instances of violence directed against foreigners are uncommon and ac-
 tually declined in 1992, officials and politicians expressed concern that anti-for-
 eigner sentiment was growing. As a result, the Federal Council urged Parliament
 to ratify the 1965 United Nations Convention Against Racism and to pass legisla-
 tion which would outlaw racist propaganda, racist attacks on human dignity, and
 refusal of a publicly offered service on racial grounds. As a precursor to ratification,
 the lower house of Parliament overwhelmingly approved the legislation in mid-De-
 cember. The upper house is expected to act in spring 1993.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-All workers, including foreign workers in Switzer-
 land, have freedom to associate freely, to join unions of their choice, and to select
 their own representatives. However, less than a third of the countrs labor force
 belongs to a union. The change from an industrial to a service-based economy, the
 high standard of living shared by a prosperous work force, and the Swiss system
 of popular referendum, which accords' citizens a voice on important political, social,
 and economic issues, are some of the reasons for the lack of interest in union mem-
 bership. Unions are free to publicize their views and determine their own policies
 to represent member interests without government interference. Unions may and do
 form federations and affiliate with international bodies. Swiss trade federations be-
 long to the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions and the World Confed-
 eration of Labor, as well as to the European Trade Union Confederation.
 The right to strike is legally recognized, but a unique labor peace agreement be-
 tween unions and employers (in existence since the 1930's) has meant fewer than
 20 strikes per year since 1975. There were no significant strikes in 1992. Federal
 employees and most cantonal and local employees do not have the right to strike.
 The only exception is the canton of Jura where both local and cantonal authorities
 have the right to strike.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Swiss law gives workers the
 right to organize and bargain collectively and protects them from acts of antiunion
 discrimination. The Government encourages voluntary negotiations between em-
 ployer and worker organizations, although for the most part employers and workers
 alike seek to exclude the Government from involving itself in their affairs. Officials
 estimate that about 40 percent of all Swiss workers are covered by collective agree-
 ments.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-There is no forced or compulsory
 labor, although there is no specific statutory or constitutional ban on it.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The minimum age for employment
 of children is 15 years. Children over 13 may be employed in light duties (e.g., help-
 ing in retail stores) for not more than 9 hours a week during the school year and
 15 hours otherwise. Employment between ages 15 and 20 is strictly regulated. For
 example, youths may not work at night, on Sundays, or under hazardous or dan-
 gerous conditions. These laws are observed in practice and enforced through inspec-
 tions by the Federal Office of Industry, Trades, and Labor.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-There is no national minimum wage. Employer
 associations and unions negotiate industrial wages during the collective bargaining
 process. Such wage agreements are also widely observed by nonunion establish-
 ments.
 The Labor Act establishes a standard 45-hour workweek for blue-collar and white-
 collar workers in industry, offices, and retail trades and a 50-hour workweek for all
 other workers. The workweek for blue-collar workers in most industries is 43hours
 and for white-collar workers 40 to 43 hours. Overtime is limited by law to 120 hours
 annually. The economy normally is at or near full employment. The resulting take-
 
 
 home pay provides Swiss workers and their families with a standard of living
 among the highest in the world.
 The Labor Act and the Federal Code of Obligations contain extensive regulations
 to protect worker health and safety. The regulations are rigorously enforced by the
 Federal Office of Industry, Professions, and Labor, providing a high standard of
 worker health and safety. There is no explicit provision in Swiss law that accords
 an employee the right to leave his place of work without prejudice in case of occupa-
 tional hazard. Some have sought justification for such a right in more general prin-
 ciples of Swiss law, but this interpretation remains subject to considerable criticism
 and controversy. Swiss employees currently have the right to file a complaint with
 an appropriate governmental regulatory body against employers who fail to adhere
 to regulations on employee safety. Employees may not be discharged during the ex-
 amination period of the complaint. The Government is in the process of completely
 revising the labor law dating from 1948.
 There were no allegations of worker rights abuses.
