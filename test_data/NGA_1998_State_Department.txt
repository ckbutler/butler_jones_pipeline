 NIGERIA
 The Government of Nigeria during 1998 went from an authoritarian dictatorship
 to a transitional government that at year's end was in the process of implementing
 a program of democratic transition to democratic civilian government in the first
 half of 1999. For the first half of the year, the Government was dominated by Gen-
 eral Sani Abacha, and committed serious human rights abuses systematically in
 order to retain political power. In June Abacha died and was succeeded by General
 Aboulsalami Abubakar, who launched a program intended to restore decentralized
 constitutional democracy in the form of a federal republic by May 29, 1999. During
 the second half of the year, the Government implemented the first half of this de-
 mocratization program effectively, impartially, and on schedule and took steps to re-
 duce signflcantly human rights abuses. Formally, the Government remained a mili-
 tary dictatorship. Throughout the year, Nigeria continued to be governed by a mili-
 tary Provisional Ruling Council (PRC) dominated by the Commander-in-Chief of the
 Armed Forces, who until June was Abacha and after June was Abubakar. The PRC
 continued to rule by decree without a constitution or a legislature. The presumed
 winner of the annulled 1993 Presidential election, chief Moshood Abiola, died of nat-
 ural causes in July on the eve of his expected release from prolonged detention on
 charges of treason. However, during the second half of the year the Government
 conducted a broad national discussion of constitutional issues, on the basis of which
 it then prepared to promulgate a new constitution based closely on the suspended
 1979 Constitution, which prescribed a democratic federal state. In August the Gov-
 ernment formed an Independent National Election Commission (INEC), which swift-
 ly relaxed restrictions on the formation and operations of political parties and sched-
 uled a series of four elections for local government officials, state (regional) legisla-
 tors and governors, national legislators, and president to be held between early De-
 cember 1998 and late February 1999. The December elections for local government
 officials, although marred by scattered violence and local irregularities, were gen-
 erally free, fair, and open, and the INEC improved its electoral procedures following
 the local elections. General Abubakar declared that he would not run for political
 office and would transfer executive power on May 29 to the winner of the presi-
 dential election scheduled for February 27. The judiciary remained subject to execu-
 tive influence and other influences; however, during the second half of the year the
 PRC Government ceased both to exercise judicial power and to deny the courts the
 authority to review its actions.
 During the last months of the Abacha regime, the Government continued to en-
 force its arbitrary authority through the federal security system (the military, the
 State Security Service (SSS), the national police, and other national and subnational
 regulatory and law enforcement agencies). The .PRC continued to control and coordi-
 nate these diverse forces. The security forces continued to commit numerous serious
 human rights abuses; however, during the latter half of the year, following
 Abubakar's consolidation of his authority within the armed forces and the PRC,
 human rights abuses by the security forces diminished significantly. There was evi-
 dence of reform of the SSS, including arrest of officials implicated in human rights
 abuses under the Abacha regime.
 Most of the population of approximately 120 million was rural and engaged in
 small-scale agriculture. Agriculture accounted for less than 40 percent of gross do-
 mestic product but employed more than 65 percent of the population. Recorded gross
 domestic product per capita was $280. Much of the nation's wealth had been con-
 centrated in the hands of a small military, political, or commercial elite through cor-
 ruption and nontransparent government contracting practices. Crude oil exports
 provided the preponderance of both national foreign exchange earnings and govern-
 ment revenues. During the year the economy grew slightly, but growth continued
 to be impeded by endemic corruption and lack of transparency in government, high
 defense and security expenditures, governmental inability to collect internal reve-
 nues effectively, numerous state-owned monopolies, and overregulation of the pri-
 vate sector. The country suffered from a severe fuel shortage caused by the closure
 of the state-owned oil refineries, whose operations declined due to corruption; the
 Government continued to require them to sell their products at below-cost prices,
 but no longer was able to subsidize them adequately due to lower international
 crude oil prices. Numerous problems of basic infrastructure persisted, and there was
 inadequate security from violent crime. These problems stemmed from corruption,
 lack of transparency in awarding government contracts, and extortion by regulatory
 officials. These problems were compounded by severe constraints on economic activ-
 ity and foreign investment posed by unreliable telecommunications and postal sys-
 tems, fuel shortages, and official corruption at points of entry.
 
 
 ;317
 The Government's previously extremely poor human rights record improved mark-
 edly in the latter half of the year.
 During the first half of the year, before the death of General Abacha, there was
 no improvement. Security forces committed extrajudicial killings and used excessive
 force to quell antigovernment protests as well as to combat crime, resulting in the
 death or injury of many individuals, including innocent civilians. Security forces tor-
 tured and beat suspects and detainees. There were reports of sexual abuse of female
 suspects and prisoners by security forces. Prison conditions remained life threaten-
 ing; many prisoners died in custody. Under Abacha, the Government repeatedly
 used arbitrary arrest and detention, and leny pretrial detention continued to be
 a problem. The Abacha Government repeatedly denied persons fair public trials by
 trying civlians and members of the armed forces before military tribunals that op-
 erated outside the constitutional court system and by prohibiting judicial review of
 the actions of these tribunals. There were many political prisoners, including pro-
 democracy activists, journalists, labor leaders, local autonomy activists, persons ac-
 cused of plotting a coup, and the winner of the most recent presidential election.
 The Abacha regime detained family members of persons whom it sought to arrest
 and routinely infringed on citizens right to privacy. It severely restricted freedom
 of speech and of the press and harassed, arrested, and detained journalists. It se-
 verely restricted freedom of assembly and association. It also restricted freedom of
 religion and freedom of movement. Under'Abacha the security services routinely
 harassed human rights and prodemocracy groups, including labor leaders, journal-
 ists, and student activists. The Government demed citizens the right to change their
 government; it continued to suspend the Constitution and die not hold and imple-
 ment the results of free and fair elections. Domestic violence against women re-
 mained widespread and permitted by law. Discrimination against women remained
 a problem. Female genital mutilation remained widespread, and child abuse and
 child prostitution were common. Ethnic and regional discrimination remained wide-
 spread and interethnic and regional tensions often became violent; a number of per-
 sons were killed in various local ethnic conflicts. The national Government and pub-
 lic sector management continued to be dominated by Muslims from the north and
 middle belt. While Abacha ruled, the Government continued to suppress harshly de-
 mands for geater local autonomy by members of ethnic minorities in the ofl-produc-
 ing Niger River delta region, including the Ogoni minority. The Government se-
 verely restricted the right of workers to associate in independent labor unions and
 to strike. Child labor remained a problem. Some children, including children traf-
 ficked from nearby countries, were subjected to forced labor. Of these abuses, those
 that were largely societal rather than governmental in origin generally persisted
 throughout the year without signfcant improvement.
 After Abubakar consolidated his authority in the armed forces-a process that
 lasted from June to August-the Government's human rights record improved
 markedly in many areas. The Government largely ceased to use lethal force to re-
 ress nonviolent political activities. The Government took steps to curb torture and
 eating of detainees and prisoners, including the dismissal and arrest of senior secu-
 rity officers well known for abusing detainees. Reports both of torture and beatings
 of detainees and prisoners and of arbitrary arrest and detention became much less
 frequent. The Govern nent acknowledged the life threatening nature of prison condi-
 tions, and took steps to ease prison congestion. In January 1999, the Ministry of
 the Interior claimed that the Presidential Committee on Prisons' Decongestion had
 released 2,433 prisoners since September. The Government ceased to use military
 tribunals to try civilians and released most known political prisoners and all known
 political detainees. General Abubakar commuted to imprisonment the death sen-
 tences of nine persons convicted by an Abacha-era military tribunal of plotting a
 coup. Under Abubakar, the Government ended the Abacha regime's harsh suppres-
 sion of press freedom; nearly all known journalists in prison were released, and the
 security forces no longer beat or detained journalists, no longer seized newspaper
 print runs, and no longer harassed newspaper printers, advertisers and distributors.
 The Government significantly relaxed its restrictions on the rights of freedom of as-
 sociation, assembly and movement. The Government acted to restore to citizens the
 right to choose their government and scheduled a presidential election for February
 1999. The Government held generally free and fair elections at the local level in De-
 cember. The Government generally ceased to harass human rights organizations
 and increased the independence of the Nigerian Human Rights Commission
 (NHRC). The Government acted to mitigate ethnic and regional discrimination and
 tensions by restoring a federal system of government with substantial local and re-
 gional autonomy; however, military authorities in Bayelsa State in the Niger delta
 region declared a state of emergency in late December in response to violence by
 members of the Ijaw ethnic group who sought greater local autonomy. The Govern-
 
 
 318
 ment released two imprisoned petroleum sector union leaders, ended government
 control of the Nigeria Labor Congress and the oil workers' unions, and restored to
 these organizations the right to elect their leaders. By year's end, although serious
 human rights problems remained in many areas, many Nigerian refugees or asylees
 in other countries had returned to Nigeria.
 A number of persons were killed in incidents of mob violence and in local ethnic
 conflicts throughout the country. Some members of the Ijaw ethnic group in the
 Niger delta region who sought greater local autonomy resorted to violence and com-
 mitted serious abuses including killings and kidnapings.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-The security forces committed nu-
 merous extrajudicial killings.
 Under the Abacha regime, security forces committed extrajudicial killings and
 used excessive force to quell antigovernment protests and civil unrest. Nigerian
 human rights groups received credible reports of deaths in custody of suspects held
 by Abacha's security forces. Security forces rarely were held accountable for exces-
 sive, deadly use of force or the death of individuals in custody. The climate of impu-
 nity created by this inaction extended to the various anticrime task forces estab-
 lished by the federal states (such as "Operation Sweep" in Lagos State), personal
 security teams, and also to the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA).
 During the Abacha regime and until Abubaliar consolidated his authority, security
 forces killed numerous demonstrators. For example, on January 30, security forces
 in Kaduna broke up a demonstration on behalf of the release of the leader of the
 Muslim Brotherhood, Ibrahim E1-Zakzaky (see Sections L.d., 2.a., and 5), and report-
 edly killed three demonstrators. On April 15 in Ibadan, police fired on unarmed
 protestors who attempted to disrupt a pro-Abacha rally and reportedly killed three
 demonstrators. On July 9, police opened fire on students marching on the campus
 of the University of Lagos (UNILAG) and reportedly killed some students. On July
 10, police shot and killed seven students during demonstrations at the University
 of Ibadan (see Section 2.b.). In July press reports alleged that officials of the Na-
 tional Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) in Borno State tortured to death
 Mallam Mohammed Kachalla, a man accused of hemp trafficking; although NDLEA
 officials admitted that Kachalla was in NDLEA custody when he died, they denied
 mistreatment (see Section 1.c.). There were continued reports of extrajudicial
 killings by the Rivers State Internal Security Task Force in Ogoniland (the part of
 the Niger River delta region in which the Ogoni ethnic minority is concentrated)
 during the first 8 months of the year. On May 25, a group of 300 Ilaje youths seized
 control of an oil platform off the coast of Ondo State, taking some 200 oil company
 employees hostage. After unsuccessful negotiations, security forces regained control
 of the platform on May 29, reportedly killing two of the Ilaje protestors. On May
 31, the international oil company and Ilaje leaders negotiated the release of the re-
 maining seven hostages.
 Security forces used violence and lethal force at roadblocks and checkpoints where
 extortion was commonplace (see Section 2.d.). On July 18, an officer of the State In-
 telligence and Investigation Bureau (SIIB) shot and killed a taxi driver in Ondo
 State. According to media reports, the SIIB officer was attempting to extort money
 from the driver at a police checkpoint. The taxi driver was shot in the head when
 he refused to pay the sum demanded, which was equivalent to approximately 23
 cents. On July 20, the police officers connected with the July 18 killing were a pre-
 hended, but at year's end they had not been tried. Accounts of security ofcers
 shooting at individuals who refused to pay bribes were numerous until July, when
 roadblocks became somewhat less frequent and the security forces became more con-
 cerned about being held accountable or  eir actions. However, some such incidents
 continued to occur during the second half of the year. In August an NDLEA officer
 shot and killed at close range a vegetable trader at a checkpoint in Borneo State
 who had refused to allow a search of his bags. The NDLEA officer was arrested but
 at year's end had not been prosecuted.
 After Abubakar consolidated his authority, the security forces continued to com-
 mit many extrajudicial killings, but these were generally not of a political character.
 During numerous fuel shortages, the police and the military personnel deployed to
 maintain order at filling stations repeatedly killed customers and operators, accord-
 ing to press reports. On September 7, during a transport workers' strike in Lagos,
 security forces killed one person in the process of breaking up a demonstration by
 striking bus drivers who created a large traffic jam by burning a taxi van at a key
 intersection. In Kano on September 18, police fired on a group of Shi'a demonstra-
 
 
 319
 tors who were protesting the continued detention of Muslim scholar and leader of
 the Muslim Brotherhood, Ibrahim El-Zakzaky (see Sections 1.d. and 5). Five of the
 approximately 2,000 persons gathered were killed; the police previously had tried
 but failed to disperse the crowd with tear gas. During the month of November alone,
 members of the combined police and military anticrnne task force known as "Oper-
 ation Sweep" reportedly committed at least 16 extrajudicial killings. For example,
 "Sweepers" shot and killed two young men suspected of robbery and fatally beat and
 killed in the presence of journalists a suspect who refused to confess to his alleged
 crime. On December 8, in the Bariga area of Lagos, "Sweepers" killed four persons,
 according to press reports, during a clash with members of the Oodua People's Con-
 gress, a militant political and cultural organization whose adherents had taken
 weapons from the police in previous confrontations. No members of the security
 forces were charged, tried, or convicted for these killings. On December 30, security
 forces guarding the Government House in Yenagoa, in Delta State, fired on an ap-
 proaching crowd of Ijaw protesters, killing two persons. Also in late December, secu-
 rity forces stationed on a bridge in Kaiama, in Bayelsa State, reportedly fired into
 an approaching crowd of Ijaw demonstrators, killing an unknown number. No mem-
 bers of the security forces were charged, tried, or convicted for these killings.
 In September the Government withdrew the Rivers State Internal Security Task
 Force from its checkpoints in Ogoniland, ending reports of extrajudicial killings by
 this security force in this area.
 Harsh prison conditions and denial of proper medical treatment contributed to the
 death of inmates (see Section 1.c.).
 On August 18, the police attempted to account for the death of journalist Bagauda
 Kaltho by implicating him as the victim of his own bomb in a January 1996 Kaduna
 blast. This explanation appeared to be an effort to avoid embarrassment for the se-
 curity forces' responsibility in his death. Journalists, labor unions, and human
 rights organizations have claimed that Kaltho died in 1996 or 1997 at the hands
 of military intelligence while in detention.
 Large scale riots in Ibadan on May 1 resulted in as many as 30 deaths, including
 hospitalized protesters and medical personnel shot by private security guards hired
 by Abacha supporters. The killings were apparently in retribution for the burning
 of property during the rioting. In July a mob i Borno stoned and killed the NDLEA
 official alleged in press accounts to have tortured and killed suspected hemp traf-
 ficker Mallam Mohammed Kachalla. Following the death in detention on July 7 of
 1993 presidential election winner M.K.O. Abiola, who was a Yoruba, about 40 per-
 sons reportedly were killed in 4 days of mob violence between members of the Yor-
 uba and Hausa ethnic groups in the cities of Lagos, Abeokuta, Ibadan, and Sokoto
 (see Sections 1.d., 3, and 5). On July 15, the taxi drivers' union in Ondo reportedly
 killed several government security officers during a violent protest against the fatal
 shooting of a taxi driver by a member of the security forces in Ondo earlier the same
 day. The crowd also seized a police station and the local prison, freed approximately
 130 prisoners, and burned the prison. Press reports stated that at least 14 persons
 were killed and approximately 30 persons were arrested during the riot. A number
 of persons were killed in sectarian religious violence.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 Members of minority ethnic groups in the oil producing areas kidnaped foreign
 and local oil company employees throughout the year to press their demands for
 more redistribution of wealth generated by joint ventures with the state-controlled
 petroleum operator and for specific projects in their areas. In early April, 64 Ijaw
 youths took control of an offshore platform in Bayelsa State for 2 weeks, holding
 20 hostages. In late May, Klaje youth took 200 workers hostage in Ondo State (see
 Section l.a.). On October 9, Ijaw youths took two expatriate hostages in Warri. The
 hostages were released after 2 days of negotiations and payment of a $11,000 (1 mil-
 lion naira) ransom by the international oil company.
 It was concluded by human rights organizations that the Razor newspaper editor
 Moshood Fayemiwo, missing in 1997, fell victim to armed robbers while traveling.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The 1979 Constitution (suspended) and the 1989 Constitution (never implemented)
 prohibit torture and mistreatment of prisoners and provide criminal sanctions for
 such excesses; however, during the Abacha regime, there were credible reports of
 detainees' deaths from torture while in custody. Security officers regularly beat sus-
 pects, detainees, and convicted prisoners. Detainees often were kept incommunicado
 for lonq periods of time. These practices continued, but at a decreased level, since
 Abacha s death in June. The Evidence Act of 1960 prohibits the introduction into
 trials of evidence obtained through torture.
 There were continued reports of torture or abuse by the Rivers State Internal Se-
 curity Task Force in Ogoniland during Abacha's rule. Reported abuses included tor-
 
 
 320
 
 ture, beating, and looting. The task force withdrew from its checkpoints in Septem-
 ber. Numerous reports and eyewitness accounts confirmed that police officials used
 flogging, stripping, and acts of public humiliation (such as forcing persons to crawl)
 as punishment for minor infractions or public disturbances.
 In March police arrested and reportedly tortured approximately 40 students who
 were members of the then-banned National Association of Nigerian Students
 (NANS), (see Section 2.b.). In July press reports alleged that NDLEA officials in
 Borno State tortured to death Mallam Mohammed Kachalla, a man accused of hemp
 trafficking. NDLEA officials admitted that Kachalla was in NDLEA custody when
 he died, but denied mistreatment (see Section L.a.).
 Police harassed, beat, arrested, and detained journalists (see Section 2.a.).
 Prison and detention conditions remained life threatening. Lack of potable water,
 inadequate sewage 'facilities, and severe overcrowding resulted in unhealthy and
 dangerous sanitary conditions. Disease was pervasive in the cramped, poorly venti-
 lated facilities and chronic shortages of medical supplies were reported. Prison in-
 mates were only irregularly allowed outside their cells for recreation or exercise and
 many inmates must provide their own food. Only those with money or whose rel-
 atives brought food regularly had sufficient food; petty corruption among prison offi-
 cials made it difficult for money provided for food to reach prisoners. Poor inmates
 often relied on handouts from others to survive. Beds or mattresses are not provided
 to many inmates, forcing them to sleep on concrete floors, often without a blanket.
 Prison officials, police, and security forces often denied inmates food and medical
 treatment as a form of punishment or to extort money from them. Harsh conditions
 and denial of proper medical treatment may have contributed to the deaths in de-
 tention of prominent political detainees such as 1993 presidential election winner
 M.K.O. Abiola, who died in prison in July, and Musa Yar'adua, who died in prison
 in late 1997. The Abacha government repeatedly denied Abiola's physician access
 to treat his patient. On December 28, according to press reports, Lt. Colonel Olu
 Akiode, one of the alleged December 1997 coup plotters sentenced with General
 Oladipo Diya in April (see Section 1.e.), died in Makurdi prison.
 Both the Abacha and Abubakar governments acknowledged the problem of over-
 crowding in the prisons as the main cause of the harsh conditions common in the
 prison system. At the end of May, the National Human Rights Commission pub-
 lished the 1997 prisons report which detailed the harsh conditions. Most prisons
 were built 70 to 80 years ago and lack adequate basic facilities. The majority of pris-
 oners are so-called awaiting trial persons (ATP's) who have not been charged. The
 May NCHR report puts the percentage of ATP's at 74 percent of the prison popu-
 lation. For example, in Ikoyi prison over 90 percent of inmates, or over 1,500 indi-
 viduals, are ATP's. They are housed in cells intended to house about 150 convicts.
 A total of over 1,600 prisoners are held in a prison designed for 800.
 The Abubakar administration focused on prison reform. In mid-September, Inter-
 nal Affairs Minister Musa Yakubu toured the nation's prisons and concluded that
 decongestion of the prisons should be a government priority. In January 1999, the
 Ministry of the Interior claimed that the Presidential Committee on Prisons Decon-
 gestion released 2,433 prisoners after September.
 Throughout the year, the Government allowed both international and domestic
 NGO's occasional access to prisons. It did not allow them continuous access to all
 prisons.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Under Abacha the security forces contin-
 ued to engage in arbitrary arrest and detention; although such practices continued
 after Abubakar consolidated his authority, the level of such abuses decreased.
 The State Security (Detention of Persons) Decree of 1984 (Decree Two) allows the
 Government to detain without charge persons suspected of acts prejudicial to state
 security or harmful to the economic well-being of the country. When invoked, Decree
 Two suspends the detainee's civil liberties and precludes judicial review. Decree 11
 of 1994 authorizes the PRC Vice Chairman or the Commissioner of Police to detain
 persons for up to 3 months without charge. This 3-month period often is exceeded
 in practice. Persons who remained-abroad in self-exile often referred to Decree Two
 to explain their refusal to return, despite specific requests by Abubakar for all per-
 sons in exile to participate in the transition program. However, the Abubakar Gov-
 ernment indicated that it would promulgate before May 29, 1999, a new constitution
 that would supercede presidential decrees, including Decrees 2 and 11, and substan-
 tial progress toward this end had been made by year's end (see Section 3). Police
 and security forces are empowered to make arrests without warrants if they be-
 lieved that there was reason to suspect that a person had committed an offense;
 they often abused this power. The law requires an arresting officer to inform the
 accused of charges at the time- of arrest and to take the accused to a station for
 
 
 321
 processing within a reasonable amount of time. By law police must provide suspects
 with the opportunity to engage counsel and post bail.
 However, police generally did not adhere to legally mandated procedures during
 the period of Abacha's rule and often held suspects incommunicado under harsh con-
 ditions for extended periods without charge, frequently for periods of many years.
 While the majority of civilian political detainees were freed in the first months
 after Abacha's death, there are no confirmed or reliable reports on the status of a
 small number of detainees presumed to remain in prison. In several public state-
 ments since early September, Head of State Abubakar repeatedly stated that all
 known political detainees had been released.
 On June 16, shortly after his appointment as Head of State, Abubakar released
 nine prominent political detainees, among them former Head of State Olusegun
 Obasanjo, Beko Ransome-Kuti, Bola Ige, Ibrahim Dasuki, and labor leaders Frank
 Kokori and Milton Dabibi. Prison officials quietly freed further detainees prior to
 Abubakar-s announcement on July 15 calling for the release of 362 nonpolitical pris-
 oners. The NGO community believes that prison officials simply released detainees
 who were unaccounted for rather than admit to central authorities that they had
 been detained without authorization.
 Chief Moshood M.O. Abiola, the winner of the 1993 Presidential election, remained
 in detention under charges of treason until July 8, when he died suddenly of natural
 causes. Abiola died on the eve of his expected release from prison, during a visit
 by U.S. government officials.
 There were no releases of former active duty military personnel implicated in the
 1995 coup plot, such as those blamed for fomenting it, that is, Colonel Lawan
 Gwadabe and Colonel Bello Fadile. Moreover, it is unclear when or whether approxi-
 mately 30 active duty military personnel imprisoned for alleged involvement in the
 plot may be released. On December 28, one of the prisoners, Lieutenant Colonel Olu
 Akiode, died in Makurdi prison. At year's end, the press reported concern for the
 health of General Diya, who also had his death sentence commutted by General
 Abubakar. Both were charged with treason by a military tribunal in April.
 On September 7, a high court in Port Harcourt unconditionally released the Ogoni
 19, who had been awaiting trial since January 1994. All other detained Ogoni activ-
 ists, including about 60 activists arrested in conjunction with Ogoni day in January,
 reportedly were released on September 15.
 There is some evidence to suggest that up to six other civilians remain political
 detainees. Turner Ogboru, a lawyer arrested in April 1990 as a suspect in the al-
 leged coup plot, was convicted by a special military tribunal that year, granted a
 pardon in 1993, ordered released, and then promptly rearrested in 1995. According
 to a human rights group, Adegbega Adebusui, a farm manager for self-exiled Gen-
 eral Alani Akinrinade, has been detained since January 1997 in connection with ac-
 cusations of Akinrinade's involvement with bombings and has yet to be released. In
 addition it is believed by human rights groups that four suspects from the 1996 air-
 port bomb blast in Lagos remained in detention. However, a foreign diplomatic mis-
 sion reported that two of the four bomb suspects were released on June 25.
 While Abubakar apparently began a serious effort to release all political detain-
 ees, the lack of authoritative information regarding the exact number of remaining
 detainees served to confirm the fact that Abacha-era security forces were able to put
 persons in detention with very little concern about due process or accountability.
 They often detained individuals on fabricated charges or used Decree Two.
 Under the Abacha government, there were reports that the NDLEA detained sus-
 pects or their relatives for lengthy periods of time without charge (see Section 1.f.).
 In May lawyers for Martin Okide filed suit against the NDLEA for their client's in-
 carceration without charge since September 1997, during which time Okide was de-
 nied access to his lawyers. As a result of the pending suit, NDLEA officials indi-
 cated that they would release Okide; at year's end, Okide reportedly had been re-
 leased. In April NDLEA agents in Kebbi State abducted the lawyer for the es-
 tranged wife of NDLEA chief Major General Musa Bamaiyi and held him incommu-
 nicado for 3 days. Press reports indicated that the lawyer's abduction was related
 to a lawsuit filed by Mrs. Bamaiyi against her husband. In July after Abubakar
 came to power, General Bamaiyi told reporters that the NDLEA would compile a
 list of all detainees in the agency's custody and would free all of those "held for no
 just reason even without our knowledge. There are no reports as to the number
 of persons subsequently released by the NDLEA.
 Persons unfortunate enough to be nearby when a crime is committed are normally
 held for interrogation for periods ranging from a few hours to several months. Even
 after their release, those detained are asked to return repeatedly for further ques-
 tioning. In March SSS agents detained labor union members (see Section 6.a.). Secu-
 rity agents harassed, arrested, and detained journalists (see Section 2.a.), and har-
 
 
 322
 assed and detained human rights activists (see Section 4). The Government also
 held approximately 130 Cameroonian prisoners of war (see Section 4).
 Under Abacha security and law enforcement agencies regularly placed relatives
 and friends of wanted suspects in detention without criminal charge to induce sus-
 p ects to surrender to arrest (see Sction 1.f.). On July 24, 1997, NDLEA agents in
 Mugu detained Mrs. S. Okoye and her 14-month old baby in lieu of her husband,
 who was sought for drug trafficking. The NDLEA released Mrs. Okoye and her baby
 when her husband turned himself in on July 27 Ogoni HR activist Bariara Kpalap
 and Abuja bureau chief of African Concord, Mohammed Adamu were released in
 July. On December 4, the Kaduna State attorney general withdrew all charges
 against Ibrahim E1-Zakzaky, leader of the Muslim Brotherhood, who had been de-
 tained since 1996 on charges of seditious publishing; his release appeared imminent
 at year's end (see Sections l.a. and 2.a.). On December 10, the Lagos High Court
 granted bail to 58 executives of a failed bank and borrowers detained under the au-
 thority of the Abacha-era Failed Bank Tribunal; some of them had been detained
 without trial for more than 3 years.
 The Government does not use forced exile. Many citizens who had lived abroad
 due to fear of persecution under the Abacha regime returned to the country during
 the closing months of the year, in response to invitations from General Abubakar
 to do so.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-Both of the suspended 1979 and the never imple-
 mented 1989 Constitutions provide for an independent judiciary; however, in prac-
 tice, the judiciary remained subject to influence by the Head of State and the Provi-
 sional Ruling Council, and the military arrogated judicial authority under the
 Abacha regime. In addition, understaffing, inefficiency, and corruption continued to
 prevent the judiciary from functioning adequately. Citizens encountered long delays
 and frequent requests for small bribes primarily due to a lack of sufficient resources
 necessary for the court system.
 The regular court system is composed of federal and state trial courts, state ap-
 peals courts, the federal Court of Appeal, and the federal Supreme Court. Under the
 1979 Constitution, courts of the first instance include magistrate or district courts,
 customary or area courts, Shari'a (Islamic) courts, and for some specified cases, the
 state high courts. The nature of the case usually determines which court has juris-
 diction. In principle customary and Shari'a courts have jurisdiction only if both
 plaintiff and defendant agree. In practice, however, fear of legal costs, delays, and
 distance to alternative venues encouraged many litigants to choose these courts.
 Criminal justice procedures call for trial within 3 months of arraignment for most
 categories of crimes. Understaffing of the judiciary, inefficient administrative proce-
 dures, petty extortion, bureaucratic inertia, poor communication between police and
 prison officials, and inadequate transportation continue to result in considerable
 delays, often stretching to several years, in bringing suspects to trial.
 Trials in the regular court system are public and generally respect constitu-
 tionally protected individual rights, including a presumption of innocence, the right
 to be present, to confront witnesses, to present evidence, and to be represented by
 legal counsel. However, there is a widespread perception that judges are easily
 bribed or "setted," and that litigants cannot rely on the courts to render impartial
 judgements.
 Some courts are understaffed. Judges frequently fail to show up for trials, often
 because'they are pursulng other means of income. In addition court officials often
 lack the proper equipment, training, and motivation for the performance of their du-
 ties, again due in no small part to inadequate compensation. On December 8, the
 Government appointed six respected judges to the federal Supreme Court, bringing
 it to its full complement of 16 judges for the first time in its history. The Govern-
 ment also named 24 new federal appellate court justices.
 There are no legal provisions barring women or other groups from testifying in
 civil court or giving their testimony less weight. However, the testimony of women
 is accorded less weight in Shari'a courts.
 Under the Abacha government, military tribunals operating outside the constitu-
 tional court system frequently were used to try both military personnel and civilians
 accused of involvement in alleged coup plots. Human rights groups assert that these
 tribunals failed to meet internationally accepted standards for fair trial. In most
 cases before the tribunals, the accused had the right to legal counsel, bail, and ap-
 peal, although some tribunals substituted a presumption of guilt for the presump-
 tion of innocence, and conviction rates in the tribunals reportedly exceeded convic-
 tion rates in the regular courts. Despite assurances in 1997 that military-style tribu-
 nals would no longer used in nonmilitary cases, the practice continued until mid-
 year. By year's end, none of the tribunals were operating. During August prisoners
 awaiting sentencing or trial for financial crimes by the Failed Banks Tribunal con-
 
 
 323
 ducted a hunger strike to protest their continued incarceration. The tribunal was
 required to bring those charged to trial within 14 days of detention; some had been
 waiting for more than 3 years. By PRC decree, the actions of the tribunals were ex-
 empt from judicial review. On December 10, in an action widely viewed as a step
 toward ending that exemption, the Lagos High Court granted bail to persons de-
 tained by the Failed Banks Tribunal.
 The case identifying 16 people charged with treason including Chief Anthony
 Enaharo, Nobel laureate Wole Soyinka, and prodemocracy advocate Dr Fred
 Fasehun was dropped. General Abubakar's invitation to the exiles to return formally
 nullified government efforts to charge Enaharo, Soyinka and others with treason.
 On July 20, 10 other prominent civilian detainees convicted by the Special Mili-
 tary Tribunal for their alleged roles in the 1995 coup plot were released, among
 them 3 journalists.
 In a mid-September interview with Newsweek magazine, Abubakar indicated that
 he believed that those remaining persons convicted of treason in coup tribunals were
 not political prisoners. However, the cases of those convicted of coup plotting in 1995
 and 1997 were reportedly under review by the PRC at year's end. The eight civilians
 sentenced by the 1995 Aziza military tribunal were not among those whose sen-
 tences were commuted in July (see Section 1.d.).
 Abubakar stated his intention to release all political detainees and political pris-
 oners and began steps to do so (see Section 1.d.). However, those persons convicted
 of coup plotting and sentenced by tribunals are widely regarded as political pris-
 oners, especially the civilians who were sentenced by military tribunals. The num-
 ber of political prisoners who remain in government custody is unknown.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-A1-
 though prohibited by the suspended 1979 Constitution, these abuses were common
 under the Abacha regime. It was widely believed that the SSS monitored private
 communication as well as the movements of journalists and individuals active in
 human rights organizations. The security forces reportedly operated networks of in-
 formants on university campuses (see Section 2.a.). Forced entry into homes was
 commonplace when security forces arrested suspects. Family members often were
 threatened with violence for alleged infractions by relatives and taken into custody
 for questioning or to force the suspect to surrender to security officials (see Sections
 1.d. and 2.a.). These practices were not reported under the Abubabkar government
 since he consolidated his authority.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The 1979 Constitution that provided for free-
 dom of speech and of the press remained suspended, and the Government continued
 systematically not to respect these rights in practice during the first half of the
 year. The Abacha regime often publicly declared support for these freedoms, but it
 nevertheless sought to limit or confine public political dialogue. The regime contin-
 ued its arbitrary intimidation and harassment of the press through legal and extra-
 legal means. However, since June when General Abubakar sudceeded Abacha, the
 Government significantly relaxed its restrictions on freedom of speech and of the
 press and increasingly respected these rights in practice.
 Although there is a large and vibrant private domestic press that is frequently
 critical of the Government, the Government also owns or controls many publica-
 tions. All newspapers and magazines are required to register with the Government
 under the Newspaper Registration Board Decree 43 of 1993, and under Abacha the
 Ministry of Culture and Information continued to threaten to close newspapers not
 registered with the board. However, the newspapers have continued to refuse to reg-
 ister. The Guardian in 1994 and the National Union of Journalists (NUJ) in 1995
 filed a lawsuit over the registration requirement. The case was still pending at
 year's end. The registration process requires editors to provide their home as well
 as office address, and the registration fee is about $3,000 for each title; therefore,
 a medium that publishes five titles would have to pay $15,000 and also have its
 yearly registration subject to good behavior. The Abacha regime, at various times,
 shut independent newspaers for perceived offenses, but there were no known cases
 of papers being prosecuted for failing to register. By year's end, the new Information
 Minister, John Nwodo, had stated that Decree 43 would be removed, but registra-
 tion requirements were not modified.
 In the first half of the year, security agents frequently harassed, arrested, and de-
 tained journalists. Virtually all senior editors of publications critical of the Govern-
 ment were subject to surveillance and harassment by security agents. Some were
 driven underground by fear of arrest and operated clandestinely from numerous lo-
 cations scattered throughout Lagos. The Government sought some editors so des-
 perately that their immediate family members were held as ransom (see Section
 
 
 1.f.). The Government later declared that these editors were "wanted dead or alive,"
 implying that they could be shot on sight. Consequently, Nsa Igiebor of Tell and
 Bayo Onanuga of The News!Tempo fled the country. On January 9, security agents
 seized the offices of the Omega Weekly magazine in Ibadan, forcing its editors and
 staffers to go underground. Credible reports stated that security operatives were at-
 tempting to arrest the magazine's top journalists. Government security forces in-
 timidated the media with a series of arrests of editors and reporters from journals
 critical of the Abacha administration. One human rights group estimated that more
 than 30 journalists were being held in detention or imprisoned after being convicted
 on criminal charges prior to Abacha's death.    -               "
 On December 28, 1997, government security operatives arrested four journalists
 working for The Diet newspaper. Three of the four were released on December 29,
 1997; but the fourth, editor Niran Malaolu, was convicted in April by the special
 military tribunal of being an accessory to the coup plot. He was given a life sen-
 tence, which was commuted to 25 years, and then commuted again by Abubakar to
 15 years. In January Obi Chukwumba, deputy editor of African Concord magazine
 was arrested by the SSS on charges undisclosed to the public. He remained in de-
 tention with two other African Concord journalists who were arrested in 1997, until
 his release in July. All three African Concord journalists subsequently were re-
 leased.
 On March 3, several journalists were beaten and arrested bypolice operatives
 during a,-prodemocracy rally in Lagos. Yusuf Olaniyonu, Chukudi Kwabuko, and
 Robert Kajom (reporters for Thisday), and Bassey Udo, -a reporter for the Post Ex-
 press, were detained at the event but subsequently released. Sunday Ode, a reporter
 for The New Nigerian; Emmanuel Ogunyale, a photojournalist for the Nigerian
 Tribune; and Kola Oshiyemi, a photojournalist for the News Agency of Nigeria also
 were arrested and reportedly beaten at the rally. On March 9, Joshua Ogbonna,
 publisher of the Rising Sun newspaper was arrested in Lagos. No charges were
 given, although credible reports indicate that he was detained because of allegedly
 defamatory articles that he published about several Abacha supporters. On March
 27, Danlami Khobu, Kuduna State bureau chief of Tell was arrested at his home
 by state security agents. Due to fear of possible arrest and harassment, many Tell
 journalists operated clandestinely. On April 6, Issac Agbo, Plateau State correspond-
 ent of The Diet, was detained and subjected to physical punishment by security offi-
 cers attached to the special military tribunal. Agbo later was released. On July 29,
 state police operatives arrested Ofonime Umanah, Anambra State correspondent of
 The Punch; Umanah was released the following day. The police gave no reason for
 the arrest. A court ordered the Federal Government to pay damages for the security
 officers' pointing a rifle at the head of the 4-year old daughter of Tell's editor-in-
 chief, Nosa Igiebor, while raiding Igiebor's home. At year's end, the Government had
 not paid damages to Tell or Igiebor. Between June and September, the Abubakar
 government released all detained journalists except Niran Malaolu, who was serving
 a prison sentence imposed by a tribunal. The long-held journalists who were re-
 leased included Kunle Ajibade, Ben Charles Obi, George Mba, and Chris Anyakwu
 (see Section lUd.).
 Subsequent to the December 21, 1997, arrest of second-in-command Lieutenant
 General Oladipo Diya and 11 others for allegedly plotting a coup, the Abacha gov-
 ernment warned journalists that they, could face treason charges if they repeated
 unsubstantiated reports carried in international media. In issuing these warnings,
 the government spokesman referred to the four journalists convicted of coup plotting
 offenses after the fact by a secret military tribunal in 1995. On January 1, the
 Lagos State police announced that they would begin arresting individuals who made
 negative remarks about the state police force. No such threats by government offi-
 cials or security forces were reported after Abubakar consolidated his authority.
 The Abacha government used other means to harass and intimidate the press, in-
 cluding intimidation of advertisers, surveillance of printers, and seizure of print
 runs. On April 20, 50 armed security operatives of the SSS and mobile police sur-
 rounded the Lagos office of the Independent Communications Network Limited
 (ICNL), publisher of The News/Tempo and PM News and arrested several ICNL
 staffers. Later that week, on April 22, security agents invaded Twenty-four Hours
 Printing Press Limited, a subsidiary of the ICNL, and arrested two managers and
 a company security guard. On April 23, all of the offices of INCL were sealed, and
 heavily armed state security guards were posted to maintain a vigil. They were
 opened shortly thereafter. No such harassment of advertisers or printers and no sei-
 zures of press runs were reported after Abubakar consolidated his authority.
 For some publications, the relationship with the Government was so adversarial
 that they were forced to operate essentially as underground newspapers. The
 Abacha government did not proscribe any newspapers during the year, although it
 
 
 325
 had done so in the past. However, on January 1, Tempo magazine was forced off
 newsstands by Kaduna State authorities. During the same day, Kaduna State police
 am  Mustapha, manager of Omola distribution agenc, for possessing
 copies of Tell, Tempo, and The News magazines. Throughout  a~ca's regime, Tell
 and The News only were sold in secret in Abuja. Vendors who displayed them open-
 ly were beaten and harassed. There were no reports of such harassment of distribu-
 tors after Abubakar consolidated his authority.
 Because newspapers and television are relatively expensive and literacy is not
 universal, radio remained the most important medium of mass communication and
 information. The Government continued to prohibit nationwide private radio broad-
 casting. The Abacha regime granted broadcasting rights to local and regional-pri-
 vate radio stations in 1994. Of the four private radio stations, two consistently
 broadcast domestic news and political commentary. Radio Kudirat and other clan-
 destine radio stations now broadcast only infrequently. License fees are not unduly
 restrictive. Pending applications submitted to the Government are not denied for po-
 litical reasons. No licenses were revoked during the year. The Abacha government
 used the foreign content provision of the Press Law of 1993 to revoke licenses grant-
 ed to some broadcasters. The Abacha regime closely monitored private radio broad-
 casts. In July the Eastern Mandate Union (EMU) announced that it would establish
 a prodemocracy radio frequency, but by year's end it had not managed to set up its
 planned radio station. The Government continued to detain Muslim Brotherhood
 leader Ihrahim El-Zakzaky in connection with operating an illegal radio station, al-
 though the Government dropped charges of seditious publication against him in De-
 cember, and his release appeared imminent at year's end (see Sections 1.d. and 2.c.).
 Television, both domestic and foreign, is widely available. However, the Govern-
 mens prohibition of nationwide private broadcasting restricted private television to
 local and regional broadcasting. There are nine privately owned television stations
 in the southwest, most of which broadcast domestic news and political commentary.
 The Press Law of 1993 requires local television stations to limit programming from
 other countries to 40 percent. In March the Nigerian Broadcasting Commission
 (NBC) considered the termination of several television broadcasting licenses. The
 Press Law of 1993 restricts the foreign content of satellite broadcasting to 20 per-
 cent. The Government does not restrict access to or reception of international cable
 or satellite television. The Government does not restrict Internet access, although
 unreliable or unavailable digital telephone service limits access and hinders service
 providers. All Internet service providers are private.
 There are two national, daily state-owned newspapers in English, the New Nige-
 rian and The Daily Times. The New Nigerian has an additional Hausa edition. Each
 of the 36 federal states has a state-owned newspaper in English, some daily and
 others weekly. There is a national radio broadcaster, the Federal radio Corporation
 of Nigeria (FRCN) that broadcasts in English, Hausa, Yoruba, Igbo, and otKer ian-
 guages. State radio stations broadcast in English and local languages. The national
 television station, NTA, is state-owned. The federal states also operate television
 stations.
 The Government controls state-owned media 'to varying degrees. Since Abubakar
 consolidated his authority, some state-owned media outlets have exercised a greater
 measure of editorial freedom.
 While private television and radio broadcasters remained economically viable on
 advertising alone, despite the restrictions that the Government imposed on them,
 government broadcasters complained that government funding and advertising were
 inadequate for their needs.
 In March Morgan Omobu, general manager of the Rivers State Radio Corporation,
 was fired by the state military administrator. His position was terminated because
 the radio station carried a report critical of the now defunct United Nigeria Con-
 gress Party (UNCP). On April 15, Kayode Adedire and Femi Adifila, journalists at
 the Osun State Broadcasting Service (OSBS) were suspended without pay for broad-
 casting a story that state government officials viewed negatively, but were rein-
 stated after 2 weeks. In May Mosun Mosunro, an editor with Ogun State Television
 (OSTV) was suspended indefinitely for allegedly approving a broadcast that asked
 Christians to boycott a government-organized prayer program in Abuja (see Section
 2.c.). He was also reinstated by year's end.
 Under General Abubakar, journalists and editors of state media did not fear sus-
 pension for their editorial decisions, although some self-censorship lingered. All can-
 didates and parties had opportunities to express their views during the December
 local elections.
 Under the Abacha regime, foreign journalists routinely were required to inform
 the Nigerian embassy in their country of origin about the subject matter of their
 proposed coverage before they were granted visas. During the first half of the year,
 
 
 326
 requests for political coverage were discouraged and often resulted in the denial of
 a visa request. Since July the visa process became easier for foreign journalists who
 sought to enter the country to cover political developments.
 During the first half of the year, the Government increased its efforts to limit aca-
 demic freedom. Security forces routinely monitored and on occasion interfered with
 conferences they perceived as forums for prodemocracy or human rights groups. In
 July the Abubakar government repealed Decree 24, which proscribed many student
 and academic staff unions. Following the repeal, organizations, including the Aca-
 demic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU), publicly met for the first time in several
 years. During the Abacha era, Nigerian embassies often refused to issue visas to vis-
 iting lecturers and artists (see Section 2.d.). This policy limited discussions between
 foreign and Nigerian academicians on topics of mutual interest. Under Abubakar
 Nigerian embassies have improved their issuance procedures for visas to academics
 and artists. Officials at Nigerian embassies have been accommodating, despite occa-
 sional continued bureaucratic delays.
 Security forces used force to quell campus disturbances several times during the
 year. Security agents disrupted some student activities, such as elections. Several
 student associations accused the Abacha regime of clandestinely inserting young
 government operatives into student organizations and the security forces reportedly
 operated networks of informers on university campuses (see Section 1.f.). Student
 grou p s believed that university authorities followed government directives t sus-
 pendor expel activist students. In March approximately 40 students, of the then-
 banned National Association of Nigerian Students N   S) were arrested and re-
 portediy tortured (see Section l.c.). The arrests occurred during delegation meetings
 m Ekiti State. The state police accused the students of attempting to hold anti-
 Abacha rallies.
 Security forces forcibly disrupted student demonstrators (see Sections 1.c. and
 2.b.).
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The suspended 1979 Constitu-
 tion provides citizens with the- right to assemble freely; however, the Government
 did not respect this right in practice during the first half of the year.
 The Government severely restricted the right of assembly until Abubakar consoli-
 dated his authority in the armed forces, but generally respected it thereafter.
 Throughout the year, the Government nominally required organizers of outdoor
 public functions to apply for permits, although this requirement often was ignored
 by both government authorities and those assembling. The Government retained
 legal provisions banning gatherings whose political, ethnic, or religious content
 might lead to unrest. Open-air religious services away from places of worship re-
 mained prohibited in most states due to religious tensions in various parts of the
 country (see Section 2.c.).
 During the first half of the year, the Abacha government continued to restrict the
 right of its critics to assemble. A number of public meetings were canceled or pre-
 vented arbitrarily, including cultural events, academic conferences, and human
 rights meetings. While permits normally are not required for public meetings in-
 doors, security forces disrupted prodemocracy conferences, meetings, or seminars
 and cited the absence of a permit as justification for their actions. Security forces
 often attempted to prevent or disperse labor-related seminars and meetings (see
 Section 6.a.).
 On March 3, antiriot' police cordoned off a rally organized by a Lagos prodemoc-
 racy NGO and turned away organization members, journalists, and featured dig-
 nitaries. Several journalists were arrested and reportedly beaten during the incident
 (see Section 2.a.). On March 7, a combined team of government operatives from Op-
 eration Sweep and the SSS disrupted an International Women's Day -workshop orga-
 nized by the Free Beko Kuti campaign committee. Also in March, approximately 40
 members of a university association banned by the regime were arrested and report-
 edly physically mistreated during an annual delegation meeting in Ekiti State (see
 Section l.c.).
 On May 1, a rally organized by a prodemocracy organization in Ibadan was dis-
 rupted when government security personnel and private security guards opened fire
 on unarfied protesters. Media reports stated that at least seven protesters were
 killed. Several human rights organizations publicly criticized the police for firing on
 the protesters.
 Police forcibly disrupted student demonstrations-some of which had degenerated
 into campus riots-that occurred at many universities in the predominantly Yoruba
 southwest following the death in detention on July 8 of the 1993 Presidential elec-
 tion winner M.I.O. Abiola, who was a Yoruba. In July police opened fire on stu-
 dents marching on the campus of the University of Lagos (UNILAG) and reportedly
 killed some students.,On July 10, police shot and killed seven students during dem-
 
 
 327
 onstrations at the University of badan (see Section 1.a.). Many students were ar-
 rested, along with several professors, during the same week. By year's end, the stu-
 dents and professors arrested during these events had been released; however, no
 government action had been taken agst the police who committed the killings.
 In late December, government authorities declared a state of emergency, and
 under it severely restricted freedom of assembly in Bayelsa State in the Niger River
 delta, in response to serious violence by members of the Ijaw ethic minority who
 sought greater local autonomy (see Sections L.a. and l.b.). Otherwise, there were no
 reports that the Government or security forces denied permits, prohibited or dis-
 rupted peaceful public meetings after Abubakar consolidated his authority in the
 armed forces.
 The suspended 1979 Constitution provides for the right to associate freely with
 other persons in political parties, trade unions, or special interest associations; how-
 ever, the Government seriously restricted the right of association during theAbacha
 era. The Government generally respected this right after Abubakar consolidated his
 authority.
 In August 1994, General Abacha prohibited the formation of political parties. In
 June 1996, the National Electoral Commission of Nigeria (NE8ON) announced a
 partial lifting of the ban but included cumbersome and complex requirements for po-
 litical party registration. In September 1996, the NECON announced the registra-
 tion of five political parties and ordered all other parties to be dissolved, effectively
 preventing the participation of the majority of established politicians and potential
 opposition leaders. Although most religious, professional, and other organizations
 did not have to register with the Government and generally were permitted to asso-
 ciate freely with other national and foreign bodies, the Abacha regime significantly
 tightened regulations on organized labor (see Section 6.a.).
 The Abacha government banned political organizations that it contended were
 founded primarily along ethnic, tribal, religious, or other parochial lines for the pur-
 pose of sponsoring various political candidates. During the first half of the year, only
 the five government-sanctioned political parties were able to sponsor political can-
 didates. However, in August General Abubakar announced the formation of the
 Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), which liberalized regulations
 governing the formation of new political parties. Under these regulations, which the
 Government respected in practice, political associations that pay a $1,200 non-
 refundable deposit and meet several other nonrestrictive requirements are recog-
 nized and provisionally registered. The Abubakar administration disbanded the
 Abacha-era parties in July. However, there were no restrictions preventing the par-
 ties from reforming and applying anew for registration. These parties as well as pre-
 viously existing parties were allowed to participate in the elections for local govern-
 ment officials in December. However, only parties that won at least 10 percent of
 the vote in at least 24 of the 36 federal states in the local elections in December
 were to be allowed to compete in the 1999 state and federal elections. In November
 INEC lowered to 5 percent the 10 percent in 24 states requirement for continued
 registration. INEC also changed the election guidelines to reflect that a minimum
 of three parties would be assured registration for the subsequent elections, even if
 less than three met the 5 percent requirements.
 The expected effect of these restrictions was to prevent parties with narrow re-
 gional or ethnic bases from competing in state and federal elections, while allowing
 them to compete in local elections.
 Government placed restrictions on NGO's under Abacha, including a raid on the
 offices of the Civil Liberties Organization in May, during which papers, computers,
 and library materials were removed. Labor unions were subjected to government
 control until Abubakar's consolidation of power. Government restrictions on labor
 unions' freedom to associate, as well as government harassment of NGO's dimin-
 ished after August (see Sections 6.a. and 4).
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The suspended 1979 Constitution provides for freedom of
 religion, including belief, practice, and religious education; however, the Govern-
 ment restricted this right in practice in certain respects. The 1979 Constitution also
 prohibits state and local governments from adopting an official religion. In 1987 the
 Government instituted a ban (still in effect at year's end) on religious organizations
 on campuses of primary schools, although individual students retain the right to
 practice their religion in recognized places of worship.
 About half the population is Muslim, about 40 percent Christian, and about 10
 percent practices traditional indigenous religions or no religion. Religious tensions
 between Muslims and Christians and between Sunni and the small number of Shi
 'ite Muslims repeatedly have erupted into violence (see Section 5). In an attempt
 to minimize these tensions, the Government continued to discourage proselytizing
 in the belief that it stimulates religious tensions, although it did not outlaw it. Al-
 
 
 though distribution of religious publications remained generally unrestricted, there
 is a lightly enforced ban on published religious advertisements. Religious program-
 ming on television and radio was closely controlled by the Abacha regime, but this
 restriction appears to have ended. The Government also continued to enforce a ban
 on open-air religious services away from places of worship (see Section 2.b.). Both
 Christian and Muslim organizations allege that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and
 the Immigration Department restricted the entry into the country of certain reli-
 gious practitioners, particularly persons suspected of proselytizing.
 The Government continued to detain Muslim Brotherhood leader Ibrahim El-
 Zakzaky, although the Government dropped charges against him in December and
 his release appeared imminent at year's end. EI-Zakzaky had been in detention
 since 1996 on charges by the Government of operating an illegal radio station and
 causing the "disaffection" of citizens. On April 17, Hajia Zeinet Ibrahim, a wife of
 E1-Zakzaky, was arrested in Kaduna by government security forces. Amnesty Inter-
 national reported that she was among eight women and six children who were ar-
 rested as a result of their alleged participation in pro-E1-Zakzaky demonstrations.
 Since their detention, there have been numerous demonstrations in support of the
 women and children; however, El-Zakzaky's supporters were released by year's end.
 On May 25, an editor with Ogun State Television (OSTV) was suspended indefi-
 nitely without pay, for allegedly approving the broadcast of a statement issued by
 the Ogun State chapter of the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN). State officials
 considered the statement asking Christians to boycott a government-organized pray-
 er program in Abuja to be offensive. At year's end, she had been reinstated.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The suspended 1979 Constitution entites citizens to move freely
 throughout the country and reside where they wish. However, the Government re-
 stricted this right. Police set up roadblocks and checkpoints where security and law
 enforcement officials routinely engaged in extortion, violence, and excessive use of
 force (see Section L.a.).
 The suspended 1979 Constitution also prohibits expulsion or denial of exit or
 entry to any citizen. However, in practice women often must obtain permission from
 a male family member before having an application for a passport processed. The
 Abacha government commonly prevented travel for political reasons. During the
 first half of the year, the Abacha-led government seized the passports of many crit-
 ics. However, General Abubakar abolished many of the restrictive travel regulations
 established during previous military administrations.
 Under the Abacha regime, journalists reported harassment at the nation's air-
 p~orts by security officils, including being required to fill out special entry and exit
 forms detailing their movement abroad, reasons for traveling, and names of friends
 and associates overseas. Abacha's security officials interrogated and temporarily
 confiscated the passports of journalists and academics seeking to depart or return-
 ing from foreign travel. The Government assigned security personnel to Murtala
 Mohammed International Airport in Lagos to screen departing passengers and to
 apprehend prodemocracy supporters. Government security agents questioned exten-
 sively citizens who had been issued visas to some Western countries. Agents report-
 edly had orders to seize passports and detain citizens whose responses were not sat-
 isfactory. Some travelers were transferred to military intelligence officers or SSS
 personnel for further questioning.
 On February 22, Lanre Ogndip, national president of the Nigeria Union of Jour-
 nalists (NUJ), and Lanre Arogundade, Lagos State chairman of the NUJ, were de-
 tained and questioned at the Murtaa Mohammed International Airport. They were
 scheduled to travel to Dakar, Senegal to address a regional conference of the West
 Africa Journalists Association (WAJA). Airport security officials seized their pass-
 ports and other documents, and each of them had to complete lengthy security
 forms. Although the passports later were released, the journalists arrived in Senegal
 2 days behind schedule. On June 9, Sule Musa, a Gambian-based Nigerian journal-
 ist, was arrested in Bakau, Gambia, reportedly on the orders of the Nigerian High
 Commissioner. Musa was detained on charges of publishing anti-Abacha stories, and
 the Gambian government deported him to Nigeria.
 Impediments to travel lessened after General Abubakar's consolidation of power.
 Officials returned several passports belonging to journalists taken by agents of the
 former Government. In August government officials returned the passport of Odia
 Ofeimun, chairman of Tempo magazine's editorial board, which was seized at
 Murtala Mohammed International Airport in March 1996. The Government also al-
 lowed several former political prisoners to travel freely abroad in order to partici-
 pate in various human rights events and political meetings. After Abubakar consoli-
 dated power, the Government was not reported to have denied passports to political
 figures or journalists, to have detained such persons entering or leaving the country,
 
 
 or to have interrogated citizens who were issued visas to foreign countries. At year's
 end, the Government was not known to be in possession of the passports of any po-
 litical figures or journalists.
 The Government cooperates with the Lagos office of the United Nations High
 Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and other humanitarian agencies in assisting
 refugees through the National Commission for Refugees and its Federal Commis-
 sioner. Regulations governing the granting of refugee status, asylum, and resettle-
 ment are outlined in Decree 52 of 1989, which incorporates many aspects of the
 1951 U.N. Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees and Its 1967 protocol. Ref-
 ugee and resettlement applications are reviewed by the Eligibility Committee estab-
 lished under Decree 52. A representative from the UNHCR participates in this com-
 mittee. The issue of the prvision of first asylum has not arisen since the establish-
 ment of the National Commission for Refugees under Decree 52.
 At year's end, there were 4,386 recognized refugees. The UNHCR repatriated 952
 Liberian refugees in July and December, leaving 2,147 of the 3,099 present at the
 beginning of the year. There were 500 Sierra Leonean, 170 Chadian, 100 Sudanese,
 42 Congolese, 13 Cameroonian refugees, and 1,414 from other countries.
 There were no reports of the forced return of persons to a country where they
 feared persecution.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens did not have the right to change their government in 1998. Under the
 Abacha government, laws continued to be made by decree a proved by the Head of
 State, and the regime committed numerous, repeated, and serious human rights
 abuses in its effort to prevent citizens from mounting peaceful opposition. However,
 during the second half of the year, the Government, under the leadership of General
 Abubakar, launched a program to restore that right to citizens by May 1999 in the
 form of a democratic and constitutional federal republic, and implemented the first
 half of this democratization program effectively, impartially, and on schedule. In De-
 cember citizens elected local government officials in elections that were generally
 free, fair, and open, although marred by scattered violence and local irregularities.
 At year's end, the country had been under military rule for 28 of its 38 years of
 independence. All effective political power continued to lie with the central Govern-
 ment and its military leadership, with ultimate authority residing in the military
 Provisional Ruling Council. The PRC continued to rule by decree without a Con-
 stitution or legislature. Although state and local governments existed, elections for
 their legislatures were not open, and state governments were run by military ad-
 ministrators and other officials appointed by the Commander-in-Chief of the armed
 forces, who served as Head of State and also controlled the national Government.
 The current Head of State, former Chief of Defense Staff General Abubakar, was
 appointed and sworn in on June 9, following the sudden death of General Sani
 Abacha on June 8.
 The Government continued not to implement the results of the 1993 Presidential
 election, the winner of which, chief Moshood Abiola, died in July while still in deten-
 tion on charges of treason, on the eve of his expected release (see Section 1.d.). Inde-
 pendent international pathologists judged that heart disease caused his death, but
 4 years in prison with inadequate medical care may have been a contributing factor.
 His death was followed by widespread mob violence and interethnic conflict (see
 Sections L.a. and 5).
 After assuming power in 1993, the former Abacha regime abolished many of the
 country's political institutions. In 1995 General Abacha announced a 3-year program
 of transition to civilian rule, which was heavily manipulated by the Government and
 appeared likely to result in Abacha's inauguration as a civilian President on October
 1. Most prominent politicians continued to remain outside the political arena, after
 key political parties were denied registration in 1996. Although the Government
 held elections for local councils in March 1997, for state legislatures in December
 1997, and for the National Assembly in April, the SSS and other organizations con-
 trolled by the PRC screened candidates and systematically excluded candidates af-
 filiated with prodemocracy or human rights organizations; voter turnout was very
 low. All five of the permitted political parties nominated Abacha as their candidate
 for president in April in hastily called government-manipulated party congresses.
 During the first half of the year, citizens' political rights continued to be restricted
 severely by the Abacha government. State security forces systematically disrupted
 public political functions and arrested and detained political opposition leaders.
 Upon succeeding Abacha, General Abubakar abrogated Abacha's program for
 transition to nominally civilian rule, and, following Abiola's death on July 7,
 Abubakar developed his own program for a transition to democratic civilian govern-
 
 
 330
 ment, which he announced in a July 20 address to the nation. He dissolved the five
 political parties established by the Abacha regime and'annulled the three elections
 conducted during that era. Abubakar promised to allow the free and fair formation
 of new political parties and pledged to transfer power to a civilian president on May
 29, 1999. He established the INEC to assist in constructing the framework for a new
 political transition period. Abubakar also announced that he would release all politi-
 cal prisoners and emphasized his commitment to greater civil liberties for citizens.
 Initially, citizens reacted cautiously to Abubakar's speech, in view of past presi-
 dential assurances and attempts to create democratic civilian rule. However, during
 the following 5 months Abubakar's Government proceeded to implement the democ-
 ratization program outlined in that address.
 In August Abubakar established a 31-member Federal Executive Council (FEC)
 as his Cabinet, which remains in place at year's end. Although 9 members of the
 FEC were former ministers of the Abacha military government, the remaining 22
 cabinet positions were filled by civilian appointees.
 On August 25, the newly established INEC announced a timetable for the transi-
 tion to civilian government and released liberal guidelines for the registration of
 new political parties (see Section 2.d.). The timetable included registration of politi-
 cal parties and voters, local government and council elections in December, state gu-
 bernatorial and assembly elections in January 1999, National Assembly elections in
 early February 1999, and a presidential election on February 27, 1999. This process
 would be concluded with a formal transfer of power on May 29, 1999. The INEC
 promulgated election rules that would restrict parties competing in state and na-
 tional elections to those that won at least 10 percent of the vote in at least 24 of
 the 36 federal states. This rule was expected to allow parties with narrow ethnic
 and regional bases to participate in local elections, but not in state and national
 elections. General Abubakar indicated that he would not be a candidate in any of
 these elections.
 During the second half of the year the Government conducted a broad national
 discussion of constitutional issues, on the basis of which it then prepared to promul-
 gate a new constitution based closely on the suspended 1979 Constitution, which
 prescribed a democratic and federal state. The Constitutional Debate Coordinating
 Committee submitted its recommendations to the PRC. After extensive debate that
 was considered inclusive by interested NGOWs, the Committee submitted rec-
 ommendations that closely adhered to the suspended 1979 Constitution. The Com-
 mittee did not include any proposals for a rotational presidency or the rotational
 principle in key offices between the six geopolitical zones. The Government indicated
 that it would promulgate the new Constitution before inaugurating an elected civil-
 ian president on May 29, 1999.
 Elections for local government officials were held throughout the nation on De-
 cember 5. Despite a grave fuel shortage, observers estimated that 30 to 40 percent
 of registered voters participated. The preelection registration process was flawed,
 excluding many potential voters due to lack of time or documentation, but there
 were no indications that this exclusion was deliberate. Organizational and logistical
 difficulties, aggravated by the fuel shortage and- lack of recent experience, caused
 voting equipment or officials to arrive late and delayed voting in many localities.
 There were scattered incidents of attempts to interfere with the voting by stealing
 ballot boxes or election materials, and the INEC dismissed several election officials
 in Ibadan on December 4 for allegedly trying to cast large numbers of fraudulent
 ballots. The election also was marred by isolated incidents of violence, mostly in the
 Niger River delta region or in Akwa Tbom, Ekiti, or Kano States. In Akwa Ibom
 State, political thugs killed a police officer who prevented them from stealing voting
 materials. In Ekiti State, one policeman reportedly shot and killed another in an
 argument during the vote, and he was then lynched by the crowd. Election delays
 and violence were worst in Delta State; six persons were shot and killed at Olupe,
 60 miles south of Warri, in an argument about the election. Nevertheless, voting
 and vote counting were monitored by representatives of all parties, vote counting
 generally was transparent, and national and international observers generally re-
 garded the election as free, open, and fair. There were no reports of postelection vio-
 lence in protest of election procedures or results. The INEC noted the need to im-
 prove its logistical and security arrangements for the early 1999 elections.
 In the December elections, the People's Democratic Party (PDP) won more than
 50 percent of local government council and chairperson positions, the All Peoples
 Party (APP) won about 30 percent, and the Alliance for Democracy (AD) won about
 20 percent. Both the PDP and the APP attracted broad support and won elections
 nationwide, although the APP was widely perceived to be dominated by persons as-
 sociated with the Abacha regime. The AD won elections chiefly in the predominantly
 Yoruba southwest and was widely perceived to represent the interests of the Yoruba
 
 
 331
 ethnic group. The INEC ruled that all three parties would be allowed to compete
 in the early 1999 state and federal elections, although the AD did not meet the re-
 quirements earlier set by the INEC for participation in those elections, as the 10
 percent threshold was lowered to 5 percent 1 week prior to the December 5 local
 elections.
 At year's end, the INEC was preparing to hold state gubernatorial and legislative
 elections in January 1999. These preparations incorporated some organizational,
 logistical, and security lessons learned from the December local elections.
 At year's end, the Head of State still had the authority to replace at will any
 elected, local government official with a sole administrator and forbid court review
 of election contests, but General Abubakar has not used this power. The review of
 subnational boundaries that the Federal Government was conducting during 1997
 was abandoned. The Government has taken no action against the 10 former state
 administrators removed from their positions in 1996, reportedly for their activities
 while holding office.
 There are no legal impediments to political participation or voting by women,
 however, men dominate the political arena. No women directly led any of the
 Abacha state-sanctioned political associations. Only a small percentage of women
 served as officers in political parties, and only three women served as government
 ministers in both Abacha's and Abubakar's cabinets. NGO's continued to protest the
 underrepresentation of women in the political process (see Section 5).
 Although there are no legal impediments to participation in government by mem-
 bers of any ethnic group, northerners and in particular Hausa continued to domi-
 nate the national government, including the military officer corps.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The Government permitted local human rights groups to operate but, under
 Abacha, often interfered with their activities, detaining, intimidating, and harassing
 their members, impounding their files and equipment, and preventing them from
 criticizing the Government's human rights record (see Sections 1.d. and 2.a.). High-
 level government officials regularly denounced the activities of the human rights
 community, frequently accusing its members and the independent press of partici-
 pating in foreign-inspired plots to destabilize the country.
 The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) is active with a Lagos office
 under the direction of a regional delegate. Its primary human rights activities dur-
 ing the year involved the training of the military on the rules of war. ICRC efforts
 also focused on persuading the Government to acknowledge the presence of approxi-
 mately 130 Cameroonian prisoners of war captured in the Bakassi conflict. The
 ICRC arranged an exchange of prisoners of war with Cameroon, which took place
 on November 24. The ICRC believes that the treatment that the prisoners received
 was in accordance with international humanitarian standards.
 The National Human Rights Commission (NHRC), established by the Abacha re-
 gime in 1996, continued to lack credibility as an independent monitoring body, al-
 though some NGO's found limited coordination with the NHRC possible and useful
 after Abacha's death. The scope of the Commission's activities was hindered by lack
 of adequate funding and organizational suppoit It was further hampered by the
 lack of a clear mandate to do anything other than convene meetings. Repeated re-
 quests for the NHRC to review the cases of alleged coup plotters and political de-
 tainees went unanswered. In July the Constitutional Rights Project (CRP) organized
 a workshop in conjunction with the NHRC on the role of the police in civil society.
 The forum provided an opportunity for dialog between the human rights community
 and the Nigerian police force. In May the NHC published the 1997 Prisons Report,
 which described the overcrowding and congestion in the prisons that prevented
 them from meeting minimum international standards. The report identified some of
 the causes for the overcrowding, but it did not address the serious sanitary and
 health problems or the petty corruption and extortion present in the prison system.
 The uncooperative stance of the Abacha government further impeded any visits
 by the Special Rapporteur for Nigeria of the United Nations Human Rights Comis-
 sion (UNHRC) or by representatives of the Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group
 in the first 8 months on the year. During the UNHRC session in April, Foreign Min-
 ister Tom Ikimi, a member of the government delegation, refused to cooperate with
 the newly appointed Special Rapporteur and blocked any visit.
 Since Abubakar consolidated his authority, reports of official harassment of local
 human rights groups ceased, as have official denunciations of human rights groups.
 The Government also began to cooperate with both national and international
 human rights groups and organizations; for example, the International Committee
 of the Red Cross. In September the Abubakar Government invited the UNHRC Spe-
 
 
 332
 cial Rapporteur to travel to Nigeria; he visited for 2 weeks in November. He trav-
 eled to five cities, met with a wide variety of government officials and representa-
 tives of nongovernmental organizations, and acknowledged that he was granted un-
 restricted access to prisons. The UNHRC is expected to release his report in March
 1999. In August the International Labor Organization (ILO) completed a successful
 fact-finding mission designed to investigate alleged government violation of the
 right to freedom of association. The visit had been delayed for over 18 months due
 to obstruction by the Abacha government.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The suspended 1979 Constitution provides citizens with the right to freedom from
 discrimination based on "community, place of origin, ethnic group, sex, religion, or
 political opinion." However, customary and religious discrimination against women
 persisted, occasional religious violence persisted, social discrimination on the basis
 of both religion and ethnicity remained widespread, and ethnic and regional ten-
 sions continued to contribute to serious violence both between groups-of citizens and
 between citizens and the security forces.
 Women.-Reports of spousal abuse were common, especially those of wife beating
 in polygynous families. Police did not normally intervene in domestic disputes,
 which seldom were discussed publicly. The Penal Code permits husbands- to use
 physical means to chastise their wives as long as it does not result in "grievous
 hArm," which is defined as loss of sight, hearing, power of speech, facial disfigure-
 ment, or other life-endangering injuries. A women's rights group estimated that
 spousal abuse occurred in 20 percent of adult relationships. In more traditional
 areas, courts and police were reluctant to intervene to protect women who accused
 their husbands formally, if the level of alleged abuse did not exceed customary
 norms in-the area. In August the Nigerian office of the United Nations Development
 Fund for Women (UNIFEM) launched a 1-year campaign against abuse of females.
 Rape, prostitution, and sexual harassment are problems. Prostitution is not illegal;
 pandering is. In some parts of the country, women reportedly continued to be har-
 assed for social and religious reasons. Purdah, the Islamic practice of keeping girls
 and women in seclusion from men outside the family, continued in parts of the far
 north.
 Women experienced considerable discrimination as well as physical abuse. There
 are no laws barring women from particular fields of employment, but women often
 experienced discrimination because the Government tolerates customary and reli-
 gious practices that adversely affect them. The Nigerian NGO's Coalition (NNC) ex-
 pressed concern with continued discrimination against women in the private sector,
 particularly in access to employment, promotion to higher professional positions,
 and in salary inequality. There were credible reports that several businesses oper-
 ated with a "get pregnant, get fired" policy. Women remained underrepresented in
 the formal sector, but played an active and vital role in the country's important in-
 formal economy. While the number of women employed in the business sector in-
 creases every year, women do not receive equal pay for equal work and often find
 it extremely difficult to acquire commercial credit or to obtain tax deductions or re-
 bates as heads of households.
 While some women have made considerable individual progress, both in the aca-
 demic and business world; women remained underprivileged. Although women are
 not barred legally from owning land, under some customary land tenure systems
 only men can own land, and women gain access to land only through marriage or
 family. In addition many customary practices do not recognize a woman's right to
 inherit her husband's property, and many widows are rendered destitute when their
 in-laws take virtually all of the deceased husband's property. Widows are subjected
 to unfavorable conditions, the result of traditional customs and economic depriva-
 tion. "Confinement" is the most common rite of deprivation to which widows are
 subjected, and it occurs predominantly in eastern Nigeria. Confined widows are held
 for up to 1 year and usually are required to shave their heads and dress in black
 garments. In other areas, a widow is considered a part of her husband's property
 and she too may be "inherited" by his family. Polygyny continued to be practiced
 widely among all ethnic groups and among Christians as well as Muslims and
 animists. Women sometimes were required to obtain permission from a male family
 member to get a passport (see Section 2.d.). The testimony of women is not equal
 to that of men in Shari'a courts (see Section i.e.). The Women's Justice Program
 and several other NGO's hosted seminars and workshops to help make the popu-
 lation more aware of the problems associated with traditional treatment of women.
 Women are discriminated against in access to education for social and economic
 reasons. In the north, Muslim communities favor boys over girls in deciding which
 
 
 '333
 children to enroll in secondary and elementary schools. In the south, economic hard-
 ship also restricts many families' ability to send girls to school and, instead, they
 are directed into commercial activities such as trading and street merchandizing.
 Children.-The Abacha government paid only sporadic attention to children's
 rights and welfare. Cases of child abuse, abandoned infants, child prostitution, and
 physically harmful child labor practices (see Section 6.d.) remained common
 throughout the country. Public schools connued to deteriorate, and limited facili-
 ties precluded access to education for many children. The requirement for compul-
 sory primary education rarely is enforced, particularly in the north (see Section 6).
 While the Government has increased spending on children's health in recent years,
 it seldom enforced even the inadequate laws designed to protect the rights of chil-
 dren. In July General Abubakar announced a commitment to improve children's
 welfare, but by year's end there had been no action to implement this commitment.
 Although the law stipulates that "no child shall be ordered to be imprisoned," ju-
 venile offenders are incarcerated routinely along with hardened adult criminals. On
 April 17, six children, ages I month to 10 years, were arrested and detained with
 their mothers on charges of participating in a demonstration by an Islamic sect in
 the northern city of Zaria (see Section 2.c.). Several international human rights or-
 ganizations protested the imprisonment of the six children, and the demonstrators
 were released by year's end. The Government only occasionally criticized child abuse
 and neglect, and it made little effort to stop customary practices harmful to chil-
 dren, such as the sale of young girls into marriage. There were credible reports that
 poor families sold their daughters into marriage as a means of supplementing their
 income. Young girls often were forced into marriage as soon as they reached pu-
 berty, regardless of age, in order to prevent the "indecency" associated with pre-
 marital sex. In April Dr. Babaide Brown, an officer with the Nigeria Immigration
 Service (NIS), announced that the Government had saved approximately 200 chil-
 dren from being sold into child slavery during the past 2 years.
 The Government publicly opposed female genital mutilation (FGM), which is
 widely condemned by international health experts as damaging to both physical and
 psychological health. The Government has taken no legal action against the prac-
 tice; in the past, government officials (notably the Ministry of Health) have sup-
 ported the campaign against FGM, which is spearheaded by private groups. In Feb
 ruary 1997, Minister of Health Ihechukwu Madubuike announced that the Govern-
 ment had established a 25-person committee to study the issue; however, at year's
 end, no results had been released by the committee. FGM still is practiced exten-
 sively in all parts of the country, predominantly in the southern and eastern zones,
 and among all ethnic and religious groups. According to the Nigerian NGO Coalition
 (NNC) study, an estimated 33 percent of all households practice the procedure. Cur-
 rent estimates place the prevalence of FGM at between 40 and 60 percent of all fe-
 males, although estimates vary. Studies conducted by the United Nations Develop-
 ment Systems (UNDS) and the World Health Organization (WHO) estimated the
 FGM rate at approximately 60 percent among the nation's female population. How-
 ever, according to local experts, the actual prevalence may be as high as 90 percent.
 Nevertheless, most agreed that the number of young girls now subjected to FGM
 is declining.
 Indigenous forms of FGM vary from the simple removal of the clitoral hood or
 labia minora to excision of the clitoris and the most dangerous form, infibulation.
 The age at which females are subjected to the practice varies from the first week
 of life until after a woman delivers her first child. Women's groups initiated aware-
 ness projects to educate communities about the health hazards of FGM. The Min-
 istry of Health and many NGO's sponsored public awareness projects o educate com-
 munities about the health hazards of FGM. The press repeatedly criticized the prac-
 tice.
 People With Disabilities.-While the Government called for private business to in-
 stitute policies ensuring fair treatment for the disabled, it did not enact any laws
 requiring greater accessibility to buildings or public transportation, nor did it formu-
 late any policy specifically ensuring the right of the disabled to work. Several pri-
 vate organizations and NG's continued to fight for the rights and welfare of the
 disabled. In August these organizations held a rally in Lagos to help raise aware-
 ness about those afflicted with disabilities. At year's end, the reported plan by the
 Government to establish a National Rehabilitation Institute and Resource Center in
 Abuja had not developed further.
 Religious Minorities.-The law prohibits religious discrimination. Nonetheless, re-
 ports were common that government officials discriminated against persons practic-
 ing a religion different from their own, notably in hiring or awarding contracts. Pri-
 vate businesses are frequently guilty of informal religious discrimination in their
 hiring practices.
 
 
 334
 Religious differences often correspond to regional and ethnic differences. For ex-
 ample, the northern region is overwhelmingly Muslim, as are the large Hausa and
 Fulani ethnic groups of that region. Many southern ethnic groups are predomi-
 nantly Christian. Consequently, at times it is difficult to distinguish religious dis-
 crimination from ethnic and regional discrimination, which is pervasive.
 Religious tensions led to several instances of violence during the year. There were
 regular clashes in northern Nigeria between Shi'a Muslim groups and Sunni Mus-
 lims, which resulted in deaths and injuries. In Kano on September 18, police fired
 on a group of Shi'ite demonstrators who were protesting the continued detention of
 Muslim leader Ibrahim El-Zakzaky, reportedly killing five persons (see Section L.a.).
 Sporadic incidents of attacks on individual religious leaders were reported, but the
 nature and perpetrators of the attacks were various, and there was not a pattern
 of one religious group attacking another. There were no attacks by Muslims on
 Christians in northern Nigeria during the year that were directly related to reli-
 gious differences. However, there were isolated retribution attacks on Yorubas, some
 of them Christian, for the killings of Hausas by Yorubas in Lagos on July 7-10 (see
 Section l.a.).
 NationallRacial/Ethnic Minorities.-The country's population of about 120 mil-
 lion is ethnically diverse, comprising more than 250 ethnic groups, many of which
 speak distinct primary languages and are concentrated geographically. There is no
 majority-ethnic group. The three largest ethnic groups the Hausa-Fulani of the
 north, the Yoruba of the southwest, and the Igbos of the southeast, who together
 make up about two-thirds of the population. The fourth largest group, the Ijaw, has
 a population of approximately 12 million.
 Societal discrimination on the basis of ethnicity is widely practiced by members
 of all ethnic groups, and is evident in private sector hiring patterns, de facto ethnic
 segregation of urban neighborhoods and a continuing paucity of marriage across
 major ethnic and regional lines. There is a long history of tension among the diverse
 ethnic groups. Although the country's successive constitutions all have prohibited
 ethnic discrimination by the State, northerners and particularly Hausas have long
 been predominant in  the national government, including the military officer corps.
 Tradition continued to impose considerable pressure on individual government ofi-
 cials to favor their own ethnic group, and ethnic favoritism persisted. Resentment
 of northern domination of the Government-aggravated by the suspension of federal
 decentralization under the Abacha regime-and resentment of Igbo success in pri-
 vate commerce, have contributed to ethnic and regional tensions.
 Chief Moshood K.O. Abiola, a Yoruba, unofficially won the 1993 presidential elec-
 tion, but the armed forces annulled the election and later imprisoned Abiola on
 charges of treason in 1994. Many in the south believed that the military acted to
 preserve -the interests of the north in doing so, pointing out-that many former heads
 of state were from the north and the middle belt, the military, or both. In the south-
 western cities of Lagos, Abeokuta, and Ibaban, 4 days of riots followed the news of
 Abiola's death, while in detention, on July 7 (see Section 1.d.). Press reports indi-
 cated that there were approximately 40 deaths, primarily of ethnic Hausas, who
 were attacked by Yorubas. Isolated retribution attacks on Yorubas by Hausas oc-
 curred in areas of Ibadan and Sokoto (see Section l.a.).
 While tensions among the largest ethnic groups generated violence related to con-
 trol of the national Government, the aspirations of some smaller ethnic groups and
 tensions among some of these groups generated violence related to the control and
 powers of subnational governments. Clashes continued between rival ethnic groups
 in Delta, Rivers, Benue, Cross River, Bayelsa, Osun, Kaduna, Plateau, and Taraba
 States, often resulting in casualties. The ongoing government review of boundaries
 for state and local government areas spark  several communal clashes, most nota-
 bly in Ife-Modakeke, Osun State (which by some estimates has taken over 100
 lives), and the Ijaw-Itsekiri conflict in Delta State (which has led to over 110 deaths
 according to unofficial estimates). In clashes between Ijaw and Ilaje in Ondo State
 and Western Delta State during July and August, hundreds reportedly were killed
 and thousands lost their homes.
 The Ogoni, an ethnic group indigenous to Rivers State in eastern Nigeria (one of
 the oil-producing regions), maintained that the Government continued a systematic
 campaign to deprive the group of its land and wealth. Members of the Ogoni group
 claimed that the Government seized their property without fair compensation, ig-
 nored the environmental impact of oil production on Ogoni land, and failed to pro-
 vide adequate public services, such as water and electricity. The confrontation be-
 tween the Government and the Ogoni remained tense at times. MOSOP, an NGO
 that campaigns for Ogoni autonomy, described government policy toward the Ogoni
 as genocide. Ogoni concerns about environmental degradation and the quality of so-
 cial services have merit. The Ogoni 19, who were accused of murdering 4 Ogoni
 
 
 leaders in July 1994, were released unconditionally in early September, as were
 other Ogonis suspected of opposing the Government.
 Other ethnic minorities, particularly in Delta, Rivers, Bayelsa and Akwa Tborn
 States have echoed Ogoni claims of environmental degradation and government in-
 difference to their development. Groups such as the Ijaw, Itsekiri, and Urhobo con-
 tinued to grow increasingly vocal in expressing their unhappiness, while incidents
 of ethnic conflict and confrontation with government forces continued to increase in
 these areas. For example, in May about 200 youths of the Ilaje ethnic group occu-
 pied an offshore oil platform owned by an international oil company and stopped
 production; security forces transported to the ol platformn by the oil company report-
 edly killed two protestrs.
 During the year, there were three areas of conffict involving members of the Ijaw
 ethnic group, the country's fourth largest. These included clashes with the Ilajes of
 Ondo and Northern Delta States; with neighboring Itsekiri and Urhobo in the Warri
 area of Delta State; and against tribal elders, and eventually government forces, in
 Bayelsa State. The conflict between the flaje and the Ijaw may have been the blood-
 iest, arising from an argument over the moving of a local government headquarters
 and the construction o what the Ilaje believed was an Ijaw traditional religious
 shrine on Ilaje territory. Several hundred persons died in intercommunal fighting,
 and many thousand Ilaje fled their traditional territory with many of them moving
 to Edo State. The trouble around Warri, a regional headquarters town for many
 international oil companies, began with another relocation (1997) of a local govern-
 ment headquarters from Ijaw to Itsekiri tearritory. Protests over this relocation es-
 calated into periodic violence in which at least 200 persons died and spread to in-
 clude fatal clashes between rival youth groups, including those of Urhobo ethnicity.
 Meanwhile, dissatisfaction with tribal elders who accepted "settlement" money from
 the Government to quiet community protests at oil spills or perceived problems with
 the international oil companies led to increased expulsions of tribal elders from vil-
 lages in Bayelsa State by youth groups. In July young militants freed one of their
 leaders from police custody by claiming to have supernatural powers that scared the
 security forces into complying with their request. Others subsequently used similar
 threats elsewhere in jaw country, some of them in conjunction with hostage taking
 incidents involving oil company employees.
 During the first half of the year, disparate organizations of youths from the Ijaw
 ethnic group became increasingly active in anti-Abacha campaigns and protests
 against oil companies operating in the Niger Delta region. A lull followed Abacha's
 death in June, but Delta youth organizations increasingly began to criticize the
 Abubakar administration, following the cancellation of Abacha's transition program
 without meeting one of their main demands: The summoning of a sovereign national
 conference. This protest culminated in the meeting on December 11 of about 4,000
 Ijaw activists in Kaiama, Bayelsa State. The activists created the Ijaw Youth Coun-
 cil and issued a declaration demanding that all government armed forces withdraw
 from Ijaw areas and that oil companies stop all production in Ijawland by December
 31. They emphasized that the Delta region belonged to the Ijaw. The declaration
 also warned that oil companies using the armed forces to defend their properties
 would be considered enemies. In response to the threat perceived by both oil compa-
 nies and government authorities, the Government eventually decided to deploy addi-
 tional armed forces in Bayelsa State and the state military administrator (governor)
 declared a state of emergency. During violent protests in Yenagoa, the state capital,
 and in Kaiama, security forces killed approximately 35 persons around the end of
 the year.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-After Abubakar came to power in June, the Govern-
 ment took several important steps toward restoring worker rights and freedom of
 association for trade unions that had deteriorated seriously between 1993 and June
 1998 under the Abacha regime. The Abubakar Government released two imprisoned
 leaders of the petroleum sector unions, Frank Kokori and Milton Dabibi; abolished
 two decrees that had removed elected leadership from the Nigeria Labour Congress
 (NLC) and the oil workers unions; and moved to allow leadership elections in these
 bodies. In August the Government also permitted an International Labor Organiza-
 tion (ILO) direct contacts mission to visit, as long demanded by the ILO.
 By year's end, the Government had drafted and was preparing to implement de-
 crees to amend or repeal several significant antilabor decrees from the Abacha era.
 Among other problems those decrees, limited the ability of unions to select their
 own leaders, granted the Labour Minister arbitrary authority to dissolve unions, re-
 quired "no strike" clauses in collective bargaining agreements, and prohibited inter-
 national affiliation without government permission.

 Workers, except members of the armed forces and employees designated as essen-
 tial by the Government, may join trade unions. Essential employees include police,
 firefighters, central bank employees, security printers (printers of currency, pass-
 ports, and government forms), and customs and excise staff. Since issuing the
 Teaching Essential Services Decree in 1993, the Government has considered edu-
 cation an essential service. However, the Decree did not proscribe education sector
 unions.
 By law any nonagricultural enterprise employing 50 or more persons in commerce
 or industry must allow blue-collar and clerical employees to unionize and must insti-
 tute a compulsory dues checkoff. The Government has in the past withdrawn the
 obigatory dues checkoff provision when unions went on strike, as in the cases of
 the 1993 general strike and the 1994 petroleum workers strike, but did not do so
 during the year.
 According to prominent labor leaders, total union membership has declined since
 the mid-1980's from 5.5 million to approximately 3 million. Approximately 10 per-
 cent of the total work force belong to unions. With the exception of a small number
 of workers in food processing enterprises, the agricultural sector, which employs the
 bulk of the work force, is not unionized. Most of the informal sector and practically
 all small businesses remain nonunionized.
 In the past, the law recognized- the right to strike, except for those performing
 essential services. Workers were required to give 21 days' notice prior to commenc-
 ing a strike. However, the Abacha regime's Decree 26 of 1996 required the insertion
 of "no strike" clauses in collective bargaining agreements and provided for the ter-
 mination of a union's automatic checkoff dues if a union launched a strike action
 in violation of such an agreement. Nevertheless,'numerous public and private sector
 strikes occurred in recent-years, often due to nonpayment of salaries or noncompli-
 ance with previous agreements.
 There are no laws prohibiting retribution against strikers and strike leaders, but
 strikers who believe that they are victims of unfair retribution may submit their
 cases- to the Industrial Arbitration Panel (IAP) with prior approval of the Labor
 Ministry. The IAP's decisions are binding on all parties but may be appealed to the
 Nigerian Industrial Court (NIC). Union representatives have described the arbitra-
 tion process as cumbersome and time consuming.
 Since 1978 the Government has mandated a single trade union structure with
 service and industrial unions grouped under the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC).
 The NLC claims to represent some 3 million workers out of a total work force of
 about 30 million. Following crippling nationwide strikes in 1994 in support of the
 presidential mandate of M.K.O. Abiola, the Abacha government dissolved the NLC's
 elected National Executive Council and placed it under the authority of a govern-
 ment-appointed sole administrator. Despite repeated promises, the Abacha govern-
 ment failed to hold new elections for the NLC executive. Direct government control
 over the NLC's National Executive prevented it from representing workers in any
 credible manner.
 In 1994 the Abacha government also dissolved the elected national executive
 councils of two key oil sector unions, the National Union of Petroleum and Natural
 Gas Workers (NUPENG) and the Petroleum and Natural Gas Senior Staff Associa-
 tion (PENGASSAN).
 The Abubakar Government took steps to restore elected leadership in the NLC,
 NUPENG, and PENGASSAN. On August 11, Abubakar repealed Decrees 9 and 10
 of 1994, which originally dissolved the union bodies' leadership and also provided
 for government-appointed sole administrators. On September 2, the Government
 and.NLC affiliates agreed on a plan for the transfer of NLC leadership and the elec-
 tion of a new Executive Council. In line with this agreement, a caretaker committee
 of union representatives took control of the NLC on September 17, while elections
 were scheduled to take place in January 1999. Transfers of authority in NUPENG
 and PENGASSAN took place in September and October, respectively. The Labor
 Minister also announced on September 2 that the Government would no longer fund
 labor bodies, such as the NLC, in order to guard labor's independence.
 The Government does not prohibit midievel employees, termed "senior staff," from
 forming labor unions, called senior staff associations, but does not allow them to-af-'
 filiate with the NLC. In 1985 'these senior staff associations formed a nationwide
 body, the Senior Staff Association of Nigeria (SESCAN). Although it consists of 22
 affiliates with a potential membership of some 600,000, the Government does not
 recognize SESCAN. In the midst of a 1986 strike by senior university staff, the Gov-
 ernment ruled that dues checkoff for senior -staff was not compulsory, although
 many private companies continue the practice. By year's end, the Government had
 drafted but not enacted a decree legally recognizing senior staff associations, which
 
 
 337
 heretofore have suffered from an ambiguous legal status, resulting in challenges to
 their authority in labor matters.
 On August 11, the Abubakar Government repealed a 1996 decree that had dis-
 solved three university-based unions: the Academic Staff Union of Universities
 (ASUU), the Nonacademic Staff Union (NASU), and the Senior Staff Association of
 Nigerian Universities (SSANU). The repeal permitted the revival of these labor bod-
 ies, and they have slowly revived.
 The Abacha overnment used threats of arrests and detention without charge to
 intimidate labor activists. Security authorities often attempted to prevent or dis-
 perse labor-related seminars and meetings (see Section 2.b.). On March 4, the then
 Labor Minister Uba Ahmed warned that allegedly subversive activities of foreign
 labor oriented NGO's would not be tolerated. Subsequently, on March 12, security
 operatives arrested 10 participants in a labor seminar in Ilomin sponsored by the
 Friedrich Ebert Foundation. A court ordered their release on bail on March 17, and
 the Government eventually dropped charges of unlawful assembly. On March 23,
 SSS agents stopped a labor rights seminar in Akwa Tbom State, organized by a
 group specialzing in labor soldrit sponsored by an international union, and de-
 tained the organizers overnight.
 In mid-June, the Abubakar Government unconditionally released NUPENG Gen-
 eral Secretary Frank Kokori, who had been detained without charge since August
 1994, and PENGASSAN General Secretary Milton Dabibi, who had been imprisoned
 without charge since January 1996. Subsequently, both men resumed leadership po-
 sitions in their unions. Since June labor seminars and labor-related activities have
 proceeded without undue interference from security authorities.
 By year's end, the Abubakar Government had drafted but not yet implemented
 decrees designed to limit or amend a number of Abacha-era decrees that limited
 freedom of association and were not subject to legal challenge. These included:
 -Decree 4 of 1996, which reured unions to pay 10 percent of member dues to
 the NLC, forced the merger of 41 unions into 29, and proscribed professional union
 organizers from holding NLC positions (effectively eliminating most general sec-
 retaries from contention);
 -Decree 26 of 1996, which provided the Labor Minister with broad authority to
 dissolve unions, required the inclusion of "no strike" clauses in collective bargaining
 agreements, and prohibited professional labor leaders from holding senior positions
 in unions or the NLC; and
 -Decree 29 of 1996, which prohibited NLC and union affiliation with inter-
 national labor bodies (except the Organization of African Trade Union Unity and the
 Organization of Trade Unions of West Africa), without the express permission of the
 Labor Minister.
 From 1995 to 1997, Nigeria was the subject of a special paragraph stemming from
 the meeting of the International Labor Congress (ILC) due to the Abacha govern-
 ment's disregard for worker rights and violations of ILO Convention 87. At the
 ILO's March governing body meeting, workers' representatives filed a complaint
 that served as the basis for the creation of a committee of inquiry, one of the most
 serious steps the ILO can take against a government that has failed to observe the
 provisions of a convention. At the ILC in June, the ILO decided to defer the Com-
 mittee of Inquiry's work for 60 days pending the Nigerian Government's receipt of
 a tripartite ILO mission during that time. Previously, the Abacha government had
 frustrated repeated ILO attempts to send a mission. However, on August 17 a four-
 person ILO team visited the country for 1 week of fact findin  an  consultations
 with workers, government, and employers. The team presented its findings to the
 ILO governing body in November.
 The Government eventually dropped the charges against 21 strike leaders in
 Kaduna, who had criminal charges pending against them from strike actions in
 1997.
 There were a number of significant strikes by state government employees during
 the final months of the year. Workers undertook the strike actions to press demands
 for a wage increase similar to that given to federal workers in September. In Lagos
 the leader of the striking state employees was dismissed from his government posi-
 tion. As of year's end, the issue of wages for state employees remained unsettled
 in most states.
 Decree 29 of 1996 prohibits NLC and union affiliation with international labor
 bodies (except the Organization of African Trade Union Unity and the Organization
 of Trade Unions of West Africa), without the express permission of the Labor Min-
 istor.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The labor laws provide for
 both the right to organize and the right to bargain collectively between management
 and trade unions. Collective bargaining continues in many sectors of the economy.
 
 
 338
 Complaints of antiunion discrinination may be brought to the Ministry of Labor for
 mediation and conciliation. The Labor Minister may refer unresolved disputes to the
 Industrial Arbitration Panel (lAP) and the NIC (see Section 6.a.). Union officials
 have questioned the independence of the NIC in view of its refusal in previous years
 to resolve various disputes stemming from the Government's failure to fulfill con-
 tract provisions for public sector em loyees. Union leaders also have criticized the
 arbitration system's dependence on te Labor Ministers referrals, which were infre-
 quent under the Abacha government.
 In 1997 the Abacha government announced the abolition of the uniform national
 salary structure and deregulation of collective bargaining in the civil service. The
 Government directed each state administration to establish its own salary structure
 on the basis of its ability to pay and with reference to the minimum wage (see Sec-
 tion 6.e.). The Government's decision was taken without consultation with the civil
 service unions. The Abubakar Government upheld the decentralization of public sec-
 tor wages in its September announcement of substantially increased wages for fed-
 eral workers and subsequent decrease in federal wages in December (see Section
 6.d.).
 An export processing zone remains under development in Calabar, Cross Rivers
 State, while a second is planned for Port Harcourt, Rivers State. Workers and em-
 ployers in such zones are to be subject to national labor laws.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The 1974 Labor Decree and the
 1979 and 1989 Constitutions prohibit forced or compulsory labor, and it is not
 known to occur with any prevalence. Although employment of persons under 18
 years of age generally is prohibited, except for agricultural and domestic work, the
 Government does not specifically prohibit forced and bonded labor by children.
 There were occasional reports of forced child labor, including child slavery rings
 operating between Nigeria and neighboring countries. According to press reports
 early in the year, Lagos police freed 14 children from an alleged child slavery ring
 that imported Togolese children to work as domestic servants. In January Togolese
 security forces arrested three persons who allegedly were trafficking 22 children
 from Togo to Benin for final sale in Nigeria. There were also reports that Nigerian
 children were exported to other African countries.
 d. Status of Child-Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment.-The 1974
 Labor Decree prohibits employment of children less than 18 years of age in com-
 merce and industry and restricts other child labor to home-based agricultural or do-
 mestic work. The law further stipulates that children may not be employed in agri-
 cultural or domestic work for more than 8 hours per day. The Decree allows the ap-
 prenticeship of youths at the age of 13 under specific conditions.
 Primary education is compulsory, although this requirement rarely is enforced.
 Studies indicate declining school enrollment due to the continuing deterioration of
 public schools and to increased economic pressures on families. The lack of sufficient
 primary school infrastructure has ended some families' access to education, forcing
 them to place children in the labor market. Growing economic difficulties have led
 to a substantial increase in the use of children for commercial activities aimed at
 enhancing meager family income. The use of children as beggars, hawkers, and bus
 conductors is widespread in urban areas. In May the Lagos State military adminis-
 trator indicated that as many as one in three children in Lagos works as a hawker.
 The use of children as domestic servants is common. According to an ILO statement
 in March, the incidence of child prostitution is also growing (see Section 5).
 The 1974 labor Decree and the 1979 and 1989 Constitutions prohibit forced or
 compulsory labor, a prohibition that extends to children, although they are not men-
 tioned specifically in the laws. Reports of forced labor are rare; however, there con-
 tinue to be cases of trafficking in children (see Section 6.c.). Private and government
 initiatives to stem the growing incidence of child employment have not been effec-
 tive.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The 1974 Labor Decree sets a minimum wage,
 which is reviewed on an ad hoc basis. The last review of the private sector minimum
 wage, held in 1991, raised the lowest monthly salary to about $5.30 (450 naira at
 the December exchange rate)-a level since rendered meaningless by inflation and
 depreciation of the naira-which does not provide a decent standard of living for a
 worker and family. Labor leaders and employers had argued unsuccessfully for an
 increase in public sector wages during the Abacha regime. Effective September 1,
 the Abubakar Government raised the benchmark minimum wage in the federal civil
 service to $62 (5,300 naira) per month, an increase from the previous level of $9.40
 (800 naira). Between September and December, state government employees agi-
 tated for a similar increase in salaries, resulting in many strike actions. In Decem-
 ber the Government announced that, given its poor oil revenue-forecast, it could no
 longer afford to pay the new federalwages. Consequently, the Government an-
 
 
 nounced its intention to reduce federal pay, with the minimum monthly wage falling
 from 5,300 to 3,000 naira ($35), and directed state governments to renegotiate their
 salary structures proportionately downward. The Government took the decisions to
 increase federal salaries in August and to reduce them in December without prior
 consultations with labor.
 The 1974 Labor Decree called for a 40-hour workweek, prescribed 2 to 4 weeks
 of annual leave, and stipulated that workers must be paid extra for hours worked
 over the legal limit. The Decree also stated that employees who work on Sundays
 and statutory public hoidays must be pad a full day  ay in addition to their nor-
 meal wages. There is no law prohibiting excessive compulsory overtime.
 The 1974 Labor Decree contains general health and safety provisions, some of
 which are aimed specifically at young or female workers. Wlhile it requires that the
 factory inspectorate of the Ministry of Labor and Employment inspect factories for
 compliance with health and safety standards, this aenc often neglects safety over-
 sight of construction sites and other nonfatory work. The Decree also requires em-
 ployers to compensate injured workers and dependent survivors of those killed in
 industrial accidents. The Labor Decree does not provide workers with the right to
 remove themselves from dangerous work situations without loss of employment. The
 Labor Ministry, which is charged with enforcement of these laws, has been largely
 ineffective in identifying violations. The Government has failed to act on various
 ILO recommendations since 1991 to update its moribund program on inspection and
 accident reporting.
