 ISRAEL AND THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES*
 Israel is a parliamentary democracy which guarantees by law and
 respects in practice the civil, political, and religious rights
 of its citizens. It has a strongly independent judiciary, free
 elections, a multi-party political system, and an elected
 legislature (the Knesset) to which the Government is
 responsible. Israeli society is characterized by its openness
 and by its wide-ranging and lively public debate of all issues
 of popular concern. The presence of an Arab minority in Israel
 presents it with the challenge of accommodating within its
 society a group which does not share the Zionist principles
 upon which the state was founded.
 Relations with Arabs in the occupied territories -- the West
 Bank, Gaza, East Jerusalem, and the Golan Heights -- caused
 the most significant human rights problems for Israel in 1982.
 These relations were strained -- and the human rights problems
 exacerbated -- as a consequence of the Government's
 implementation of its declared policy of strengthening,
 expanding, and developing Jewish settlements.
 Israel enjoys a relatively high standard of living. In 1982,
 the Government continued to improve both the material
 well-being of its citizens and the overall quality of life.
 Although Israel has a free market economy, Israeli governmental
 economic policy is heavily oriented toward social welfare.
 From its inception in 1948, the State of Israel has been in a
 continuing state of war with most of its Arab neighbors, who
 have refused to accept its right to exist or to agree to live
 in peace with it. Throughout its history, Israel has been
 subject to terrorist attacks, including bombings and other
 forms of violence. In 1982, Israel carried out the last phase
 of its withdrawal from the Sinai Peninsula in implementation of
 the treaty of peace with Egypt. The absence of peace treaties
 between Israel and its other Arab neighbors still makes
 security a dominant concern and affects many facets of Israel's
 national life.
 In June 1982, following a terrorist attack on Israel's
 Ambassador to Great Britain, retaliatory Israeli air strikes
 inside Lebanon, and subsequent artillery/rocket attacks by
 Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) forces in Lebanon
 against northern Israel, Israeli forces invaded Lebanon and
 quickly occupied most of the country south of Beirut. Host PLO
 military forces and facilities were located in areas heavily
 populated by civilians, and the Israeli attacks against the
 PLO, as well as the long Israeli siege of West Beirut, resulted
 in thousands of civilian casualties. In Lebanon, the Israelis
 detained several thousand persons, who they said were suspected
 of terrorist activities. Some were subsequently released.
 (For details, see special section at the end of the report on
 Israel.)
 In September 1982, Lebanese President-elect Bashir Gemayel was
 assassinated, and Israeli forces entered West Beirut with the
 stated purpose of- preventing possible serious incidents and
 *Because of the sharply differing politico-social-environments
 in Israel and in the Arab territories -Israel has occupied since
 the 1967 war, the respective human rights situations--are
 treated in separate but parallel fashion. The report on the
 Israeli-occupied territories follows the report for Israel.

 guaranteeing calm. While the Israeli forces were in occupation
 of West Beirut, a massacre of hundreds of Palestinian and
 Lebanese inhabitants in the Sabra and Shatila refugee camps
 of West Beirut took place. According to reports from the
 survivors and others near the scene, it was perpetrated by
 Lebanese Phalangist and Haddad militia elements who had been
 permitted to enter the camps by the Israel Defense Forces. A
 commission of inquiry appointed by the Government of Israel
 conducted a vigorous and well-publicized investigation into the
 circumstances surrounding the massacre. This investigation was
 still in progress at the end of 1982.
 The human rights situation in Israel was virtually unchanged in
 1982 from previous years. It is expected to remain
 substantially the same in the near and long-term future.
 ISRAEL
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Killing
 There were no reports that killings were practiced in Israel by
 either the Government or any opposition group during 1982.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reports that such a practice occurred in Israel
 during 1982.
 c. Torture
 Torture is prohibited in Israel. Israeli laws governing the
 rules of evidence state that any evidence or confession
 obtained under duress is inadmissable as legal evidence. The
 administrative codes of conduct of the prison and police
 authorities contain stringent sanctions against the use of
 force or brutality. Police officers accused of employing
 brutality or violence on prisoners or suspects may be
 prosecuted either in administrative courts for violation of the
 code of conduct, or in regular criminal courts for criminal
 assaults, or both. There were no confirmed reports of torture
 in 1982.
 d. Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 Cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment is prohibited in
 Israel, and law enforcement normally is carried out without the
 excessive use of force.
 Israel acknowledges problems of serious overcrowding in its
 prisons and, in mid-1982, the Government authorized a plan to
 improve prison facilities and increase the number of cells by
 25 percent by the end of 1983.
 e. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 Israeli law provides strong guarantees against arbitrary arrest
 or imprisonment. Writs of habeas corpus and other procedural
 and substantive safeguards are employed, and defendants are
 considered innocent until proven guilty. Administrative
 detention, as discussed below, is legal. There were no known
 instances of its use in 1982.
 
 
 1159
 Under the Emergency Powers Law of 1979, judicial review is
 required at several crucial points in the process of applying
 administrative detention. Any individual who is the subject of
 an administrative detention must be brought before the
 president of the appropriate district court within 48 hours of
 his being taken into custody. Each case of administrative
 detention must be subjected to judicial review at least every
 three months thereafter for the entire period of detention.
 The decision of the president of the district court can be
 appealed in the Supreme Court. At the time of the initial
 order of detention and at each subsequent review, the judicial
 authority is empowered to rule on both the procedural and
 substantive aspects of the case.
 f. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The right to a hearing by an impartial tribunal with
 representation by counsel is guaranteed by law. The judiciary
 in Israel is independent and effectively insulated from
 political interference. With the exception of security cases,
 all trials are open. In security cases, Israeli law provides
 that part or all of a trial may be closed, with the burden of
 justifying in camera proceedings falling on the prosecution.
 Counsel is present during closed proceedings. Amnesty
 International in its 1982 annual report, covering 1981,
 expressed concern about the secrecy in certain military trials
 under the Defense Emergency Regulations in Israel.
 g. Invasion of the Home
 There are effective legal safeguards against arbitrary invasion
 of the home. There were no recorded illegal invasions of the
 home in 1982.
 2. Respect for Civil and Political Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Freedom of speech and press are basic rights in Israel. Both
 the Hebrew and Arabic press are free and express a wide variety
 of political opinions, although all media are subject to
 censorship on security and military matters. Movies and
 theater are subject to censorship if deemed offensive to
 religious or social mores or if considered inciteful. In 1982,
 there were few reported cases of productions banned on such
 grounds. A censorship decision may be appealed through the
 judiciary.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 In 1980, the Order for Prevention of Terror Law was passed. It
 forbids tangible public manifestations of support for
 organizations defined as terrorist in nature. Proscribed acts
 have included flying the Palestinian flag, displaying
 Palestinian nationalist slogans, and publicly expressing
 support for the PLO. In November 1982, three Israeli Arabs
 were detained under this law on suspicion of having flown
 Palestinian flags in a village in the western Galilee.
 The organized labor movement functions without hindrance and
 wields substantial political and economic power. The right to
 strike is exercised freqently and effectively. Most workers,
 Arab and Jewish, are members of the Histadrut, the general
 confederation of labor.
 
 15-480 0 - 83 - 74
 
 
 1160
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Israel was founded as a Jewish state in which all citizens,
 including the non-Jewish minorities, are guaranteed freedom of
 religion by law. Muslims, Christians, Druze, and other
 minority religions make up roughly 17 percent of the
 population. The dominant interpretation of the Jewish nature of
 the state has been secular, and not religious. Israel
 inherited the Ottoman millet system, under which each religious
 community is governed in matters of personal status by its own
 religious law, and not by civil law. The practical effect of
 this feature of Israeli law is to give each religious community
 great freedom to observe its own customs and religion within
 the area where the millet system applies, but sometimes to
 cause serious inconveniences to individuals who do not follow
 the dominant tradition within one religious community. These
 difficulties do not normally arise in religious worship, but in
 areas such as marriage or conversion to Judaism. Within the
 Jewish community, orthodox tradition has a dominant position.
 By their nature, the Law of: Return of 1950 (which abolished all
 restrictions on Jewish immigration) and the Citizenship Law of
 1952 (which granted every Jew the right to citzenship upon
 .arrival in Israel) confer an advantage to Jews in matters of
 immigration and citizenship.
 An anti-proselytizing measure, adopted by the Knesset in late
 1977, priobibIts the-offering of bribes or material benefits as
 inducements to religious conversion. In a clarification placed
 in the Kneslet record on January 15, 1979, the Minister of
 Justice-stated,that the law is not intended to restrict the
 religious- freedom of any community or to impede any community
 from the pursuit of normal educational or philanthropic
 activities. The Attorney General has ordered that no action be
 taken under the law without his express permission, and the law
 has never been employed. It nevertheless continues to cause
 uneasiness among certain Christian groups.
 While Druze Arabs are subject to the military draft on the same
 basis as Jews, Christian and Muslim Arabs (except for some
 Bedouin) are not permitted to serve in the armed forces.
 d. Freedom of Movement within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Israeli ciitizens enjoy freedom of movement within the country
 and are free to travel abroad or to emigrate, subject to
 government review to determine whether military service-related
 obligations have been satisfied. However, Israeli citizens of
 Arab origin may be confined to their neighborhoods or villages
 by military orders as a "preventive" measure under Article 110
 of the security regulations carried over from the mandatory
 .period. In one such instance, in October 1982, an Arab
 auspected of having~circulated leaflets on behalf of an Arab
 radical group in the Galilee was restricted by the armed forces
 to his home from dusk to dawn for a period~of six months.
 Since.1948,_Israel has .taken in well over one million Jewish
 refugees from Europe, the Middle East, and North Africa and has
 worked to integrate them fully into its society and economy.
 Integration of smaller numbers of immigrants continues.
 United Nations General-Assembly Resolution 194 of December 11,
 1948 calls upon Israel to permit Arab refugees who left their
 homes in the 1947-48 fighting to return if they are willing to
 live in peace or, if they so choose, to be compensated for
 
 
 1161
 their losses. Israel hap not recognized the validity of this
 resolution, pointing out the losses to its own citizens who
 fled Arab states; it has, however, on occasion indicated
 willingness to take back some refugees in the context of a
 final settlement.
 e. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Israel is a parliamentary democracy with a multi-party system.
 All Israeli citizens, including Arabs, enjoy the freedom to
 vote and to participate in the political process, and several
 Arabs are members of the Knesset, Israel's parliament.
 However, because of the Jewish character of the state and the
 continuing state of war between Israel and most of its Arab
 neighbors, the Arab minority is relatively powerless and tends
 to feel alienated. There is no legal prohibition against Arab
 or Arab-oriented political parties. Rakah, nominally
 affiliated with the Communist International, serves in fact as
 a focal point for Arab dissent and, in the 1981 elections, won
 four seats in the Knesset.
 The legal status of the approximately 1,200 members of the
 Black Hebrew Community remains unresolved after almost a
 decade. Few of them are residing in Israel legally, most
 having entered the country on tourist visas which expired long
 ago. Approximately 80 Black Hebrews have renounced their
 American citizenship and may be considered stateless, since the
 Government of Israel has not accepted their claim of right to
 immigrant status under the Law of Return.
 Women participate freely in the Israeli political process and
 account for more than 40 percent of the political party
 membership. At the end of 1982, nine of the 120 members of the
 Knesset were women.
 3. Government Attitude Regarding International and Non-
 governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations of
 Human Rights
 Human Rights groups in Israel work for the protection of
 individual liberties, and the Government maintains an office of
 human rights in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Private
 groups, such as the Israeli League for Human and Civil Rights,
 the Association for Civil Rights in Israel, and Peace Now,
 freely criticize Israeli government actions in Israel, the
 occupied territories, and Lebanon, and they issue statements
 and pamphlets, hold press conferences, and organize
 demonstrations without government interference.
 The Government does not obstruct visits to Israel by
 representatives of international human rights groups. While
 disputing the applicability of the Geneva Convention, the
 Government in 1982 continued to permit the International
 Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) to visit prisoners in Israel
 and the occupied territories and, after an initial delay,
 permitted the ICRC to have access to most of the prisoners
 captured as a result of the war in Lebanon. Freedom House, in
 its annual report for 1982, called Israel "free* and commented,
 "In general the rule of law is observed, although Arabs in
 Israel are not accorded the full rights of citizens." Amnesty
 International appealed to the Government in July and August to
 allow outside access to prisoners captured in Lebanon, to
 inquire into allegations of torture, to publish full details on
 the names and status of the prisoners, and to release all
 prisoners held solely on the grounds of political opinions,
 
 
 1162
 allegiances, or ethnic origins. In an August 25 reply to
 Amnesty International, the Attorney General denied the accuracy
 of reports of mistreatment and torture, stated that civilian
 detainees and Syrian prisoners of war were being treated
 according to the applicable provisions of the Geneva
 Conventions, and denied that any persons were being held solely
 because of political opinions, allegiances, or ethnic origins.
 4. Economic, Social, and Cultural Situation
 The population of Israel is slightly over four million and is
 increasing by about 1.9 percent a year. Per capita GNP in 1981
 was $5,375 (1981 dollars). In recent years annualrinflation in
 Israel has exceeded 100 percent. The consumer price index rose
 131.5 percent in 1982. While most of the population is
 protected from this level of inflation by a complex system of
 indexing (salaries, bonds, and pensions, for example, are
 linked to the cost of living), the Government has given
 attention to reducing inflation to eliminate its distorting
 effect on the economy. As a small country with few natural
 resources, Israel historically has run a balance of payments
 deficit to provide its people with a more or less European
 standard of living while maintaining a strong military
 posture. Substantial financial assistance from abroad, public
 and private, has helped Israel bridge its payments gap. State
 educabion in-either secular or religious schools is free and
 compulsory for all Israeli citizens through age 15. The
 primary school enrollment ratio is 97 percent and the adult
 literacy rate about 88 percent. The parallel education systems
 in Israel for Jews and Arabs, conducted in Hebrew and Arabic
 respectively, show a disparity in quality with greater
 resources per student going into the Jewish system. The Arab
 literacy rate is 48 percent, and Arabs are not represented in
 institutions of higher learning in percentages that correspond
 to their proportion of the population. Although there are no
 legal barriers to the admission of Arab citizens to
 institutions of higher-learning, they make up only three
 percent of university students. Some Israeli Arabs seek
 education and employment abroad.
 Israel has an excellent health care system and one of the
 highest physician-to-patient ratios in the world. Life
 expectancy is 72 years, and the infant mortality rate is 2.2
 percent per 1,000 live births. Although the entire population
 has access to safe water, 4,754 cases of viral hepatitis were
 reported in 1981. Figures for the first nine months of 1982,
 however, show a 20 percent decline in reported cases.
 Title to 93 percent of the land in Israel is held by the state
 or quasi-public organizations in trust for the Jewish people.
 According to law, anyone, including Israeli Arabs, may purchase
 the remaining seven percent of privately-owned land through
 ordinary commercial transactions. Expropriations of Arab land
 (although subject to legal review as to purpose and amount of
 compensation) have been used for promoting Jewish settlement to
 the detriment of the Israeli Arab population in Arab-populated
 areas. Freedom House states in its annual report for 1982 that
 "Arabs are, in effect, not allowed to buy land from Jews."
 The Arab minority has equal rights under the law in most
 respects.: Hoiever, there are complaints of discrimination in
 such areas as employment and appointment to government
 positions. Some Arabs have risen to responsible positions in
 the civil service, generally in the Arab departments of
 government ministries. Several Arabs are members of the
 
 
 1163
 Knesset.  Druze and Circassians are subject to Israel's
 military draft, and some Bedouin serve voluntarily in special
 units. Other Muslims and Christians are not permitted to serve
 and therefore do not qualify for many of the important economic
 and social benefits that derive from military service. Despite
 some governmental and private efforts to bridge the gap, there
 is little social interaction between Israeli Arabs and Jews.
 The Equal Rights for Women Law (1951) formalized women's rights
 in Israel, granting them the right to own and deal in property
 and the right to guardianship of their children. It also
 abolished unilateral divorce by the husband, polygamy, and
 child marriage. Minor females were included in compulsory
 education laws at that time. Under the Employment of Women Law
 (1954), women have the right to work, at equal pay for equal
 work, without discrimination in the same jobs as men so long as
 they are physically able to do the work without impairing their
 health.
 Strong secular and religious forces contest changes in the
 status of women in Israel. Since the establishment of the
 state, all matters relating to the family have been handled by
 the religious courts. These courts base their decisions on
 religious law, which secular women reportedly find
 discriminatory in some instances. The religious family law
 includes the legal concept protecting married women from
 marital rape. A ruling of the religious courts based on this
 concept was upheld in a 1980 appeal decision of the Israeli
 Supreme Court. A suggestion to alter Israeli criminal law to
 bring it into conformity with this concept was approved by the
 Government.
 5. Prisoners Detained by Israeli Forces in Lebanon
 During Israel's invasion and subsequent occupation of southern
 Lebanon and Beirut in 1982, large numbers of prisoners,
 including members of armed Palestinian and Lebanese groups and
 non-combatants, were detained by Israeli forces. According to
 the Israeli government, those detained were suspected of
 involvement in terrorism; over 9,000 had been detained as of
 mid-July. Detentions apparently continued during the rest of
 the year, although by the end of December the number of
 detainees had dropped to about 5,700. Approximately 300 of the
 prisoners were Syrian military personnel who, after a delay of
 up to two months in most cases, were accorded treatment due to
 prisoners of war in accordance with the Third Geneva
 Convention, including access to them by representatives of the
 International Committee of the Red Cross. The Israeli
 government did not accord POW status to any of the other
 prisoners and did not acknowledge the applicability to them of
 the Fourth Geneva Convention, relating to civilians in
 military-occupied areas. Nevertheless, in mid-July the
 Government agreed to treat the prisoners in accordance with the
 humanitarian provisions of the Fourth Convention and to allow
 the International Committee of the Red Cross access to all of
 them.
 Large numbers of the prisoners captured in June were
 transferred to Israel, according to the Israeli government, due
 to the lack of facilities for them in Lebanon. By July most of
 the prisoners had been concentrated in a newly-built prison
 camp near Ansar in southern Lebanon. Aside from the Syrian
 POWs, an unknown but apparently fluctuating number of prisoners
 from Lebanon remained in Israel.
 
 
 1164
 As of the end of 1982, the Israeli government had not made
 public a full or partial list of names of the detainees, had
 not permitted relatives access to the detainees, and, while
 granting the Red Cross access to most of the prisoners,
 apparently maintained some of them incommunicado and
 unaccounted for. Because of the lack of charges, access, or,
 in some cases, information as to whether or where specific
 persons are being detained, legal recourse for the detainees
 was extremely limited; however, various cases were filed in the
 Israeli judicial system on behalf of some of the prisoners,
 demanding that the Government set forth the legal basis for
 holding them. As of the end of 1982, no decisions had been
 announced in those cases. At year end, the number of prisoners
 captured in Lebanon and still held by Israel, aside from about
 300 Syrian POWs, was probably in the neighborhood of 5,400,
 with approximately 5,300 held in Ansar prison camp.
 In July and August 1982, Amnesty International expressed
 concern to the Government of Israel over reports of beatings
 and other ill-treatment of Israeli-held prisoners in Lebanon
 and Israel and asked that the Government conduct an inquiry
 into allegations of torture and publish the results of the
 investigation. The Government denied the accuracy of the
 reports upon which Amnesty International had based its appeals.
 
 
 1165
 THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES
 The territories occupied by Israel in 1967 consisted of the
 West Bank, East Jerusalem, the Gaza Strip, the Golan Heights,
 and the Sinai Peninsula.. Consistent with the Egyptian-Israeli
 peace treaty, the last part of the Sinai was returned to Egypt
 on April 25, 1982. Throughout 1982, the West Bank and the Gaza
 Strip remained under military government, while the Government
 of Israel regarded East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights as
 subject to Israeli law, jurisdiction, and administration.
 The complex human rights situation in the occupied territories,
 particularly in the West Bank where the majority of the settled
 Arab population is located, is largely the result of friction
 between the occupation authorities and the indigenous Arab
 population. The strain of more than 15 years of occupation,
 terrorist actions by Palestinian guerrilla organizations, and
 Arab fears of creeping annexation have produced an atmosphere
 of constant tension. Control over Arab institutions
 (particularly the universities) and broad restrictions on a
 wide range of political, economic, and social activities,
 together with the taking of Arab land (approximately 35 percent
 of the West Bank is now under some form of direct Israeli
 control) underlie Arab concerns that the long-term goal of the
 occupation authorities is to envelop and annex the West Bank.
 The West Bank and Gaza are under military government. The
 occupation authorities govern these territories with a
 combination of pre-existing law and military orders. These
 laws and orders do not offer the inhabitants all the human
 rights guarantees available within Israel itself. The UN
 holds, and the US agrees, that the Fourth Geneva Convention
 concdrning the protection of civilian populations under
 military occupation applies to Israel's governance of the
 occupied territories. Israel declares that it voluntarily
 observes most of the Fourth Convention's provisions, even
 though it does not accept that these territories are within the
 purview of the Convention. Major differences in regard to the
 applicability of those provisions have to do with prohibiting
 the introduction of civilian settlers and with prohibitions
 against the use of certain forms of punishment.
 Arabs and Jews resident in the occupied territories continue to
 suffer from terrorist acts, especially bombings. Historically,
 responsibility for such acts has generally been claimed by
 Palestinian organizations based outside the occupied
 territories. In addition, Palestinian Arabs have complained
 that Israel has neglected its duty as an occupying power to
 provide adequate protection against vigilante actions by
 Israeli settlers.
 Israel has made a concerted effort to reshape the politics of
 the occupied territories through the West Bank and Gaza Civil
 Administrations. The Civil Administrations were created in
 late 1981 and are under the control of the Ministry of
 Defense. They are staffed by military as well as civilian
 personnel. In 1982, they played a dominant role in such
 practices as the dismissal of elected and appointed officials,
 the deportation of university faculty, the imposition of house
 or town arrest and other collective punishments, the banning of
 newspapers, and the implementation of broad restrictions on
 speech and assembly. The Civil Administrations also made major
 efforts to transfer patronage and authority from elected and
 established Palestinian nationalist leaders whom Israel objects
 
 
 1166
 to as being supporters of the Palestine Liberation
 Organization. As a key part of thi effort, the West Bank
 Civil Administration actively promoted the spread of
 rural-based, quasi-political organizations known as "Village
 Leagues." These organizations were provided with arms and
 financial assistance by occupation authorities. Allegations
 have been made by local inhabitants that the Village Leagues
 have been involved in graft and violence against other West
 Bankers.
 From late February to early May 1982, some Israeli actions --
 particularly the dismissal of public officials -- helped to
 spark violent public disturbances in the West Bank and Gaza.
 These grew more intense after an unrelated shooting incident on
 the Temple Mount (Al Haram Ash Sharif) in Jerusalem on April
 11, 1982. The turbulent period saw total curfews for prolonged
 periods, hundreds Qf arrests, and the deaths of approximately a
 dozen Arabs in clashes with security forces. In isolated*
 incidents during this period, two Israelis were also killed.
 The overall conditions of the population of the Gaza Strip did
 not change materially in 1982. Although many Gazans are
 underemployed, there is almost no unemployment, because of job
 opportunities in- Israel and elsewhere in the Middle East. The
 Gazans' basic needs for food, clothing, and shelter are
 satisfied. However, overcrowded housing conditions,
 particularly in the refugee camps, remain serious. The
 authorities have offered resettlement for refugees outside the
 camps, with the proviso that evacuated camp dwellings be
 destroyed. Gazans suffer from an absence of social and
 cultural activities. Although there is a literary journal, no
 newspapers are published, and the distribution of the East
 Jerusalem Arabic Press is sporadic. In 1982, citrus growers
 protested restrictions on exports, claiming losses of up to
 hundreds of thousands of dollars. During the year, several
 prominent Gazans were placed under travel restrictions,
 preventing them from leaving Gaza without first obtaining
 permission from the authorities.
 During the first half of the year, there was an atmosphere of
 tense confrontation between members of the Druze community on
 the Golan Heights and Israeli authorities as a result of the
 extension of Israeli law, jurisdiction, and administration to
 the Golan Heights.. Some Druze were detained in the course of a
 prolonged protest strike. After mid-year, however, the strike
 was called off, the detainees were released, and the region was
 quiet.
 In September 1982, President Reagan offered proposals aimed at
 reinvigorating the effort, pursuant to the 1978 Camp David
 Accords, to negotiate transitional arrangements for the West
 Bank and Gaza. Such arrangements are to prefigure negotiations
 to determine the final status of the West Bank and Gaza.
 No major changes in the overall human rights situation are
 foreseen for the coming year. Absent dramatic progress in the
 peace process, confrontation between the inhabitants of the
 territories and the occupation authorities is likely to remain
 at the same level as in recent years. Israel is likely to
 continue its efforts to contain and reshape the politics of the
 West Bank and Gaza through the Civil Administrations, the
 acquisition of land for settlements, official subsidization of
 population growth in existing settlements, and financial and
 political support for the Village Leagues.
 
 
 1167
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom From:
 a. Killing
 No credible evidence of political murder by Israeli security
 forces came to light in 1982, and there is no reason to believe
 that such practices are condoned by the Government of Israel.
 There were scores of instances of terrorism, some of which
 resulted in killings. One Israeli civilian and one settler
 were murdered, and at least three more were wounded in
 terrorist assaults. Three Arabs were murdered, apparently for
 association with the Israeli-sponsored Arab Village Leagues,
 and there were a half-dozen unsuccessful assassination
 attempts. There were numerous incidents involving explosive
 devices, and more than a dozen casualties stemming from such
 incidents. Responsiblity was generally claimed by Palestinian
 organizations outside the occupied territories. However, three
 ,grenade attacks (without injury) on Arab homes near the Israeli
 settlement of Kiryat Arba over the summer and the placing of
 booby traps on a Hebron playground (which injured several Arab
 youths) in the fall of 1982 were alleged by local inhabitants
 to have been carried out by Israeli settlers.
 Over 30 persons (including four Israelis) were killed in the
 West Bank and Gaza in incidents involving weapons or explosive
 devices during 1982; there were also a large number of persons
 wounded, although precise figures are not available. Most of
 the casualties occurred in the period of March through May.
 Casualties in confrontations after May were considerably
 diminished, as devices like tear gas, face shields, and rubber
 .bullets were brought into use by security forces.
 Israeli settlers caused the deaths of at least three Arabs. In
 each case suspects were detained, but they claimed to have shot
 to stop youths from stoning their vehicles. There is no record
 of these suspects being brought to trial.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no known cases of individuals disappearing from the
 occupied territories in 1982. However, the families of many
 arrested Arabs complained that their relatives were detained
 without prompt notification, particularly in the cases of those
 arrested during demonstrations or on alleged security grounds.
 There were claims in the Arab press of over a dozen kidnappings
 of Arabs, including children, by settlers during 1982, and West
 Bank Arabs complained that no attempts were made by the
 authorities to punish those whom the Arabs felt were
 responsible.
 c. Torture
 Israeli authorities have stressed repeatedly that torture is
 forbidden by Israeli law and that violators are punished.
 There have been allegations by detainees of psychological
 pressures, physical mistreatment, and instances of brutality by
 Israeli officials during interrogation of security suspects.
 The number of such cases has declined over the past two years,
 and there is no indication that torture is condoned by Israeli
 authorities. In the only well-documented case in 1982, two
 Israeli women soldiers accused of beating a British teacher
 with heavy sticks during questioning were tried and
 imprisoned.
 
 
 1168
 d. Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 Israeli forces in the West Bank and Gaza have been observed
 roughing up individuals in the process of making arrests during
 periods of unrest. Inhabitants allege that such treatment is
 intended to discourage involvement in demonstrations. Israeli
 laws and regulations provide recourse in cases of misbehavior
 toward civilians, and 40 separate cases were filed against
 Israeli soldiers in the West Bank between October 1981 and
 October 1982, in which at least 17 soldiers were convicted. In
 one such case in November 1982, an Israeli officer and six
 servicemen were indicted for brutality while dealing with a
 public disturbance in Hebron in March. During the trial, two
 of the defendants, including the officer, testified that they
 had been following orders from the highest echelons of the
 defense establishment in carrying out the alleged acts of
 brutality. The trial was still underway at the end of 1982.
 In April 1982, the Israeli-based Association for Civil Rights
 in Israel issued a report which criticized the conduct of the
 Israel Defense Forces on the Golan Heights. In particular, the
 report detailed allegations of brutality by the Israel Defense
 Forces and recourse to collective punishment. In May, six
 Golan Druze were wounded when police opened fire to disperse
 demonstrators.
 Curfews imposed after security incidents or demonstrations were
 more frequent and of longer duration in 1982 than in the
 preceding year. These curfews often caused considerable
 hardship to the affected inhabitants. On several occasions,
 males in villages and refugee camps were rounded up and held
 outdoors for extended periods, sometimes overnight. Similar
 treatment was administered to students following demonstrations
 at Hebron, Sir Zeit, and An Najah universities. The towns of
 El Bireh,tRamallah, Nablus and Halhul were totally closed by
 military order for at least three weeks in March and April.
 Members of the-Village Leagues were implicated in a number of
 instances of mistreatment in the first half of 1982, including
 an assault on employees of a West Bank university and shooting
 incidents in which one person died and up to a dozen persons
 were wounded. There was a marked tapering off of such
 incidents in the second half of the year.
 Overcrowding of prisons housing Palestinian prisoners has been
 acknowledged by Israeli prison authorities for many years;
 however, no significant corrective measures were taken during
 1982. Complaints concerning medical and dental treatment and
 sanitation continue to be presented to international
 organizations and diplomatic missions.
 Since 1978, Israel has permitted International Committee of the
 Red Cross (ICRC) representatives resident in Israel and the
 occupied territories to visit detainees without witnesses
 during the period of their interrogation. This may occur after
 the fourteenth day following their arrest. Such visits are not
 permitted, however, until completion of the investigation by
 the Israeli authorities, regardless of when the individual was
 detained. During the initial visit, the ICRC representative
 may determine identity, state of health, and conditions of
 detention. On subsequent visits, allowed every 14 days,
 complete freedom of discussion is permitted. Israel allows the
 immediate examination of the detainee by an approved physician
 and investigates:any-complaints. In certain cases, Israel can
 suspend notification and visitation on security grounds.
 
 
 1169
 However, Israel maintains that 97 percent of all detainees are
 visited within the specified period.
 Israel permits ICRC delegates to visit convicted Arab security
 prisoners in Israel and the occupied territories. whenever the
 ICRC considers it necessary, an ICRC physician may conduct
 medical examinations without witnesses. The ICRC may also
 submit inquiries about specific cases to the Israeli
 authorities. During the first half of 1982, ICRC delegates
 made 1,399 visits to 742 detainees under interrogation on the
 West Bank and in the Gaza Strip. They visited some 3,000 other
 prisoners in some 16 places of detention in Israel and the
 occupied territories. In accordance with ICRC recommendations,
 since June 1981 the diet for detainees in the occupied
 territories has been the same as for those in Israel.
 e. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 Administrative detention (the imprisonment of individuals
 without formal charges or trial) is authorized under Israeli
 law, as well as under the Jordanian law and British mandatory
 code which were in force before 1967 in the West Bank and Gaza
 respectively and which continue in force there. In 1979,
 Israeli authorities issued the Emergency Powers Law restricting
 the use of administrative detention within Israel proper. In
 1980, the provisions of this law, with minor changes, were
 extended to the occupied territories. These provisions limit
 the initial application of administrative detention to a
 maximum period of three months and provide for more frequent
 review. During 1982, no West Bank residents were held in
 administrative detention. Thirteen Golan Heights residents and
 one Gaza resident were held for periods of up to several months
 during the year, but ultimately were released.
 Under the Fourth Geneva Convention, administrative detention is
 not permissible beyond one year from the "general close of
 military operations." Israel maintains that administrative
 detention is occasionally necessary to prevent terrorist
 operations when a court proceeding would jeopardize sensitive
 security information. Administrative detainees have several
 forms of recourse from detention orders, but the right of
 appeal is rarely exercised. Appeals are not known to have
 resulted in the reversal of any decisions of the military
 authorities.
 Habeas corpus provisions do not apply to security detainees
 subject to military trial. The arrest of sizable numbers of
 Arabs has been common in the wake of terrorist incidents or
 when security forces disperse a demonstration. Usually, such
 arrests do not result in either formal charges or prolonged
 detention.
 As of October 1982, there were 1,584 non-Israeli citizen Arabs
 in prison for security offenses in Israel or in the
 territories. None was under administrative detention. Five
 hundred and ninety-four other suspected security offenders were
 awaiting trial.  (Security offenses, as such, are not defined
 in Israeli law. They refer to areas of the law dealing with,
 inter alia, terrorist acts, espionage, and incitement, as well
 as non-violent public displays of Palestinian nationalism.)
 The Government of Israel on December 14, 1981 extended Israeli
 law, jurisdiction, and administration to the portion of the
 Golan Heights (southwest Syria) which it has occupied since the
 1967 war. The Israeli government subsequently required all
 
 
 1170
 residents of the area to obtain Israeli identity cards. When
 most of them refused, the Government cut the area's telephone
 communications and sealed off the area from outside access for
 more than five weeks. Residents without identity cards were
 for several months unable to leave the area, even for medical
 treatment. As of the. end of 1982, they were still subject to
 tfine.-if caught outside the area without Israeli identity cards.
 :Amnesty International, in a special report in October 1982,
 expressed concern over the extensive use of restriction orders
 under which, from January 1980 through May 1982, 77 persons
 were ordered to remain within the confines of their town or
 village for periods of three months or more, in some cases for
 more than two years, as a result of extensions of original
 orders. Such restrictions, which often make it difficult for
 those affected to practice their profession or to pursue their
 course of study, involve no formal charges and are ordered by
 regional military commanders with no requirement for judicial
 approval.
 f. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Jordanian law as modified by Israeli authorities is in force in
 the West Bank in civil and criminal matters, as is British
 mandatory law in Gaza. The adjudication of these laws has been
 left in the hands of an Arab judiciary, which acts
 independently of the Israeli authorities. Residents of the
 occupied territories accused of non-security offenses receive
 public trials in local civilian courts. In the case of Israeli
 settlements on the West Bank, Israeli courts and law function
 even in cases involving Arabs.
 Alleged security offenders are tried in Israeli military courts
 with a military judge--trained in law--presiding and are
 defended by counsel. Most military trials are open to the
 public. Military regulations require simultaneous translation
 of trial proceedings into the language of the accused.
 However, there have been complaints from Arab prisoners that
 they are unable to follow their proceedings or that they are
 asked to sign confessions written in Hebrew, a language that
 most of them do not understand.
 There are complaints by Arabs that the practice of adjudicating
 appeals from military orders under which land is seized for
 stated security purposes by tribunals composed of military
 officers does not provide an independent, fair review of the
 dispute. In 1982, there continued to be numerous cases of land
 seizures upon designation as state property. In such cases,
 there were almost invariably complaints by local inhabitants
 that the 21-day period in which all documents substantiating
 private ownership must be submitted was too brief to permit
 adequate defense. This was especially the case since many such
 documents were available only from sources outside the West
 Bank and since the authorities had in a number of cases
 permitted earthmoving work to begin on seized land before the
 grace period had lapsed. While there have been cases in which
 court orders have been obtained to prevent house demolitions,
 in most cases the demolitions take place with so little warning
 that no judicial remedy exists.
 Civilian court verdicts and orders of the Civil Administrations
 may be appealed to the Israeli Supreme Court. Non-judicial
 administrative orders of the military government may be
 appealed to area military commanders and the Supreme Court. No
 appeal of military court verdicts is possible, although the.
 area commander can and does exercise the right of commutation.
 
 
 1171
 g. Invasion of the Home
 Under the occupation regulations, military authorities can and
 do enter private homes and institutions in pursuit of security
 objectives without prior judicial approval.
 Houses of the families of individuals believed to have been
 involved in security incidents or located in the vicinity of
 terrorist incidents have been demolished or sealed and the
 families displaced. In 1982, nine houses were sealed and
 another nine demolished -- in some instances with damage to
 neighboring houses. As a result, families were rendered
 homeless because a member was suspected of a security offense.
 For example, security forces demolished two houses and sealed a
 third in the Ayda refugee camp after charging the sons of the
 owners with attempting to firebomb an Israeli bus near the
 settlement town of Gilo near Jerusalem. One house sealed
 during 1982 was later unsealed by the authorities. There is no
 judicial process prior to a decision to seal or demolish a
 dwelling in security cases. Houses were also demolished during
 the year in various parts of the occupied territories on the
 grounds that they had been illegally constructed. Palestinians
 complained that building permits were difficult for them to
 obtain but were granted freely to Israeli settlers. There is
 no indication that financial compensation is paid in cases of
 demolition and sealing as described above.
 About 300 houses were demolished in Rafah, along the Egyptian
 border, following the Israeli withdrawal from the Sinai in
 April 1982, in order to create a security strip. The tenants
 were offered compensation and alternate building sites.
 Arab villagers have alleged that Israeli settlers uproot
 saplings, olive trees, and grapevines and take them, as well as
 topsoil, for their own use without payment. Such allegations
 have been made in regard to both disputed land and land under
 undisputed Arab ownership.
 2. Respect for Civil and Political Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Freedom of expression is restricted on stated security
 grounds. Most of the Arabic press in the occupied territories
 is located in East Jerusalem. It is frequently outspoken in
 its criticism of Israeli policies, but reports and editorials
 are regularly censored or excised. Distribution of the East
 Jerusalem newspaper "Al Fajr" by the Israeli postal system
 remains suspended since the publication in 1981 of several
 particularly outspoken anti-Israeli articles. The distribution
 of each of the Arabic dailies was suspended (in some cases for
 weeks) during the spring and summer of 1982. Periodic bans
 were also placed on the Communist weekly "Al Taliyya."
 Occupation authorities have forbidden several journalists from
 leaving their home areas in the West Bank, effectively
 preventing these individuals from working in their offices.
 Educational materials, periodicals, and books originating
 outside Israel are censored for alleged anti-Jewish or
 anti-Israeli content and for perceived encouragement of
 Palestinian nationalism. The occupation authorities maintain a
 list of forbidden publications. During 1982, two lists of
 additional titles were issued, bringing the total of
 publications to approximately 1,120. These include, inter
 alia, extreme anti-Semitic publications, official Arab
 
 
 1172
 propaganda publications, publications of the Institute for
 Palestine Studies, and literary efforts by individuals
 identified with the Palestinian movement, Possession of such
 publications, many of which are legal in Israel and East
 Jerusalem, by a West Bank or Gaza Arab is a criminal offense,
 frequently resulting in fine or imprisonment; however,
 according to Israeli press reports, the list of forbidden
 publications is not made available to the public.
 Membership in, contact with, or expressed support for the aims
 of proscribed organizations (e.g., the Palestine Liberation
 Organization or its constituent elements) is grounds for
 arrest. Display or use of the Palestinian flag or its combined
 colors is illegal. Mayors of towns in the West Bank and Gaza
 have been specifically enjoined by military government order
 from making statements supportive of the PLO.
 Between 1971 and 1975, under the Israeli occupation, the West
 Bank's four universities were established from smaller,
 pre-existing schools. All were closed by the occupation
 authorities for varying periods in 1982 after student
 demonstrations. During 1982, Bir Zeit University was closed
 for a total of five months, An Najah University at Nablus for
 one and one-half months, and Bethlehem and Hebron Universities
 for one month each. University and secondary school openings
 for the fall were delayed twice by the occupation authorities
 for a total of three weeks. The schools are free to select
 which courses will be taught, and professors are not harassed
 by the occupation authorities in the classroom. In 1982, the
 authorities began to require non-residents wishing to teach at
 West Bank universities to sign a written declaration as part of
 their application for a work permit, renouncing, inter ala,
 the PLO. Most non-resident faculty declined to do so on stated
 grounds of academic freedom and the expressed wish to avoid
 being forced to take sides in a local political issue. As a
 result, 26 faculty members, including two Americans, were
 compelled to leave the area when the authorities refused to
 renew their documents. Another 27 faculty members, including
 16 Americans, were permitted to remain in the area but were
 banned from teaching. There was one case in which a West
 Banker seeking permission to travel abroad to pursue university
 studies was required to sign an anti-PLO declaration as a
 condition for obtaining an exit visa.
 Following protests related to the extension of Israeli law,
 jurisdiction, and administration to the Golan Heights in
 December 1981, and continuing in early 1982, access to that
 area by outsiders, including journalists, was not permitted.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Israeli occupation authorities have permitted a wide range
 of labor, professional, and fraternal groups organized before
 1967 to continue to function in the occupied territories. No
 political parties or other groups viewed as political are
 permitted.
 Although membership in the Histadrut, the Israeli national
 labor organization, is open to Arab workers in East Jerusalem,
 most have declined such association. No new labor unions have
 been created in the West Bank since the beginning of
 occupation, and a number of Arab unions have been disbanded by
 the occupation authorities for alleged political activities.
 Strikes are legal as long as they are not undertaken for
 political reasons; there were no reports of arrests or
 
 
 1173
 imprisonment solely for organizing labor activity in 1982.
 However, security forces regularly conduct searches of union
 offices and other properties. The occupation authorities must
 approve all candidates for office in labor union elections.
 Professional associations, especially those of doctors,
 lawyers, pharmacists, and engineers, are active and frequently
 take public stands on political issues. Public gatherings,
 however, require the permission of the authorities. Such
 permission can be and is often withheld from both Arab and
 Israeli groups on the grounds of public order. Under
 regulations in force, a group of five or more individuals
 gathered without permission can be termed an illegal assembly,
 and security forces normally attempt to disperse any sizable
 gathering of West Bankers.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 There is complete freedom of religious practice in the occupied
 territories. Israel has an exemplary record in protecting
 Muslim and Christian holy places and has usually assured
 freedom of access thereto. Some West Bank leaders (and, less
 frequently, West Bankers in general) have occasionally been
 prevented on security grounds from entering Jerusalem to attend
 Friday prayers at Al Aqsa Mosque. Israeli authorities have
 also on occasion barred Jewish groups seeking access to the
 Temple Mount (Al Haram Ash Sharif) on both religious and
 security grounds.
 However, at Hebron's Ibrahimi Mosque, which is also'the site of
 the ancient Synagogue of Abraham and the Tombs of the Prophets,
 the military government has failed to prevent the gradual
 reduction of the Muslim presence in favor of Jewish
 worshippers. In addition, Jewish settlers have prevented
 Muslim worshippers from entering the mosque for Friday prayers,
 and military guards demand that male visitors observe Jewish
 customs and don skull caps before entering the mosque.
 Arab worshippers and tourists at Al Aqsa Mosque were attacked
 on April 11, 1982 (Easter Sunday) by an Israeli who was
 subsequently charged with multiple counts of assault and
 homicide. The defendant was still on trial at the end of
 1982. The attack, which was condemned by the Government of
 Israel, resulted in the death of two people and sparked off a
 series of violent demonstrations throughout the West Bank and
 Gaza.
 During 1982, there were a few instances of desecration of
 Christian churches in Jerusalem, the most serious being the
 arson in the summer of a well-known Baptist Church. Officials
 of the Jerusalem Municipality and the Israeli Government were
 quick to condemn these actions, which the press generally
 attributed to ultra-nationalist Jewish groups.
 d. Freedom of Movement within The Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Freedom of movement is in many respects unrestricted for Arabs
 within the occupied territories, and almost 70,000 Arabs travel
 daily to Israel to work. Vehicles owned by inhabitants of the
 territories have distinctive license plates, however, and are
 frequently stopped for security checks. Also, Arab inhabitants
 of the occupied territories are officially required to obtain
 permits to stay overnight in Israel. West Bank Arabs are
 normally forbidden to remain in Jerusalem after midnight. At
 
 
 1174
 least three deposed mayors and one serving mayor were forbidden
 to leave their towns during 1982. Numerous other individuals
 had similar restrictions or personal curfews requiring them to
 remain at home from dusk to dawn.
 For several months in 1982, Israeli security forces restricted
 to their villages Druze in the occupied Golan Heights who
 refused to accept Israeli ID cards. In March 1982, the ICRC
 complained that an ICRC delegate who visited the Golan the same
 month was not granted freedom of movement or full liberty to
 select the persons with whom he wished to speak. While Syrians
 of the Druze religion are permitted by the Israelis to live in
 the Golan Heights, the Israeli Government has not permitted
 Syrians of other religions to return to their homes and farms
 there.
 Most inhabitants of the West Bank and Gaza are free to travel
 abroad and return, and many thousands do so each year. Such
 travel requires exit visas. There are restrictions on certain
 categories of residents, however, including limitations on the
 frequency of border crossings by young men, occasional
 temporary bans on foreign travel by residents of specific towns
 or areas following demonstrations or terrorist acts, and bans
 on specific individuals. The latter include mayors and other
 leaders, and persons suspected of anti-occupation activities.
 Several prominent Palestinians have been refused permission to
 visit the US and elsewhere and denied permission to make the
 Hajj, the Muslim pilgrimage to Mecca. Students leaving the
 occupied territories for multi-year studies abroad in some
 cases have not been permitted to return by the Israeli
 authorities.
 Despite the state of war legally existing between Israel and
 Jordan, two-way travel between the West Bank and Jordan has.
 been permitted. Inhabitants of the West Bank returning from
 Jordan, as well as other Arabs or persons of Arab descent,. are
 subject to search for weapons and contraband. There have been
 complaints that these searches of person and property are
 unnecessarily rigorous and constitute harassment.
 There are no official obstacles to emigration. Net emigration,
 primarily for economic reasons, approximates 15,000 annually.
 e. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 The West Bank and the Gaza Strip have been under Israeli
 military occupation and rule since 1967. The status of the
 Golan Heights was similar until Israeli law, jurisdiction, and
 administration were extended to the area in 1981. In 1967, the
 Government of Israel declared East Jerusalem, including
 adjoining areas of the West Sank, to be under Israeli law,
 jurisdiction, and administration, and the inhabitants have had
 the right to participate in Israeli national and municipal
 elections since then.
 There have been two elections of mayors and municipal
 councilmen in the West Bank since the beginning of Israeli
 occupation; these were in 1972 and 1976. Israel permitted Arab
 nationalists outspokenly hostile to Israel to run for office in
 the 1976 election., Municipal elections scheduled for the
 spring of 1980 were not held, and there was no indication of
 when these elections might occur.
 After a 1980 attack on Israeli settlers in Hebron, the
 occupation authorities prohibited elected mayors throughout the
 
 
 1175
 West Bank from engaging in political activities not directly
 related to municipal administration. Although all the mayors
 have dealt with the military occupation authorities on routine
 matters, some refused to deal with the newly created Civil
 Administration. During 1982, seven elected West Bank mayors
 were removed from office by year's end, allegedly for violating
 the 1980 order or for refusal to cooperate with the Civil
 Administration. The elected municipal councils of two West
 Bank towns and the appointed mayor of Gaza were also dismissed
 from office. Three of the affected towns were afterwards
 governed by Israeli military officers, and one was governed by
 Arab employees of the Israeli Interior Ministry.
 Throughout 1982, there was a continual effort to create a role
 for the Village Leagues in the political process. There were
 constant efforts by the West Bank Civil Administration to
 interpose the Leagues as an intermediary between the
 inhabitants and the occupation authorities by refusal to accept
 requests for such services as the registration of births or
 marriages, building permits, bridge crossing permits, and
 family reunion applications without the participation of the
 local league.  village League members often exacted extra fees
 for their services. Many West Bankers complained that the
 Leagues' expanding activities undermine the elected Arab
 political structure.
 The status of women in the occupied territories reflects
 traditional Palestinian values and practices. Matters
 pertaining to marriage, family, and personal status are
 governed by Muslim or Christian religious law, as interpreted
 by religious courts; accordingly, women generally do not have
 equal status. However, since 1967 the proportion of girls and
 women in school has steadily increased, so that they now
 comprise nearly one-half of the school population.
 Unenfranchised under the law in force before 1967, women were
 permitted by the military government to vote in the municipal
 elections held in 1976. Education and enfranchisement are
 affecting the traditional status of women. Relatively few
 women in the occupied territories participate in the hired
 labor force. Many women workers are not counted, since they
 are employed on farms, at home, or in small family enterprises
 excluded from statistics. Women who work in Israel or for
 Israeli firms receive the full protection of Israeli labor law
 equally with men.
 3. Government Attitude Regarding International and Non-
 governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations of
 Human Rights
 The ICRC regularly inspects prison conditions in the occupied
 territories and makes recommendations for improvement.
 For several years, the UN Human Rights Commission and other UN
 bodies have adopted resolutions condemning alleged Israeli
 human rights violations in the occupied territories. The US
 voted against most of these resolutions, regarding them as
 one-sided and politically motivated. Although Israel has been
 generally unresponsive to efforts by UN bodies to conduct
 investigations in territories under its jurisdiction on the
 grounds that its experience suggests that the reports of such
 investigations would reflect political bias rather than the
 facts, it has cooperated with recent visits by representatives
 of the World Health Organization, the International Labor
 Organization, and the UN Educational, Scientific, and Cultural
 Organization.
 
 15-480 0 - 83 - 75
 
 
 1176
 Amnesty International's 1982 report, which covered 1981, stated
 that organization's concern for the "imprisonment of prisoners
 of conscience, the use of administrative measures to physically
 restrict individuals or detain them without charge or trial,
 and the lack of effective safeguards to protect those in
 custody from ill-treatment." The report noted that in 1981
 Amnesty called for the release of 28 prisoners of conscience
 and investigated the cases of 12 possible prisoners of
 conscience. A special Amnesty report criticized restriction
 orders. Freedom House's 1982 report noted that "detentions,
 house arrest, and brutality have been reported against Arabs
 opposing Israel's Palestine policy."
 4. Economic, Social, and Cultural Situation
 Comprehensive statistical information is not readily available
 for all economic and social indicators with regard to the Arab
 inhabitants of the occupied territories. It is obvious,
 however, that living standards have risen steadily throughout
 the period of Israeli control. Official Israeli statistics
 indicate that unemployment in the occupied territories is as
 low as one percent, and real per capita income has risen 11-12
 percent annually since 1968. In the West Bank, per capita GNP
 in 1981 was $1,379, over three times the 1968 figure. Much of
 this increase in per capita income can be attributed to the
 large number of Palestinian workers employed in Israel, the
 remittances of Palestinians working in Arab countries, and an
 open trade policy between Israel and the occupied territories.
 Israel restricts the construction of new factories through a
 number of regulations. As a result, more individuals than
 otherwise would be the case -- especially those with higher
 education -- may migrate to other countries where greater
 opportunities exist. In addition, Israel has restricted the
 import of capital from the Arab world, in part through a new
 regulation requiring military government permits to bring in
 more than $3,000. These restrictions are in fact unevenly
 applied, but have hit hardest at the development budgets of
 municipalities considered by the authorities to be excessively
 under Palestine Liberation Organization influence. The taking
 of land for settlements and for military use in the occupied
 territories has adversely affected the livelihood of
 considerable numbers of Arab residents. Land utilized by
 Israel in this way amounts to more than one-third of the West
 Bank. In many cases, those affected have had to leave farming
 to become day laborers. There are currently more than 130
 non-military settlements in the occupied territories, excluding
 East Jerusalem, with a total population of about 27,000. At
 least 20 of these settlements were established in 1982. A
 further problem results from the use of a part of the West
 Bank's limited water resources for Israeli settlements.
 Israeli water control policies in the West Bank ensure that new
 water resources are reserved for Israeli settlements, thus
 depriving Arab agriculture and industry.
 The military government and the UN Relief and Works Agency meet
 the basic educational needs of refugee students in the occupied
 territories. Overall adjusted primary school enrollment rose
 from about 56 percent of the school-age population in 1967 to
 about 90 percent in 1981. The number of girls receiving
 education has markedly increased and stood at 45 percent of the
 student total as of 1981.
