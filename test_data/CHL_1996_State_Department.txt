 CHILE
 Chile is a multiparty democracy with a constitution that provides for a strong ex-
 ecutive, a bicameral legislature, and an independent judiciary. Approved by referen-
 dum in 1980, the Constitution was written under the former military government
 and establishes institutional limits on popular rule. President Eduardo Frei, a
 Christian Democrat, began his 6-year term in 1994. The National Congress com-
 prises 120 deputies and 46 senators. The government coalition of six parties holds
 a majority in the lower house. An opposition coalition, together with several inde-
 pendent and eight appointed senators, controls the upper chamber. A pointees of
 the former president, General August Pinohet, continue to influence  e constitu-
 tionally independent judicial branch. However, turnover in the courts has led to a
 sincant diminution of that influence.
 "The armed forces are constitutionally subordinate to the President through an ap-
 pointed Minister of Defense but enjoy a large degree of legal autonomy. Most nota-
 bly, the President must have the concurrence of the National Security Council to
 remove service chiefs. The Carabiners (the uniformed national police) have primary
 responsibility for public order and safety and border security. The civilian Investiga-
 tions Police are responsible for criminal investigations and immigration control.
 Both organizations-although formally under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of De-
 fense, which determines their budget-are under operational control of the Ministry
 
 
 381
 of Interior. Some alleged perpetrators of human rights abuses during the military
 regime remain on active duty in the army. The security forces committed a number
 of human rights abuses.
 The export-led, free market economy experienced its 13th consecutive year of ex-
 pansion. The most important export was copper, forestry products, fresh fruit, fish
 meal, and manufactured goods were also significant sources of foreign exchange.
 Gross domestic product grew at 8 5 percent unemployment remained steady at
 around 5.5 percent, and inflation icreased sightly to 8.2 percent. Since 1987 the
 percentage of the population living below the poverty line has decreased from 45 to
 25 percent at the en~ of 1996. Annual per capita income rose above $4,700 in 1995.
 The Government generally respected its citizens' human rights. However, there
 continued to be some problem areas. The most serious cases involved allegations of
 torture, brutality, and police use of excessive force. There continue to be reports of
 physical abuse in jails and prisons. Discrimination and violence against women, and
 violence  against children  are  problems. Many   indigenous people remain
 marinalized.
 Almost all other human rights concerns are related to abuses that occurred during
 the former military government, primarily between 1973 and 1978. Efforts to bring
 abusers to justice in cases datingback to the early years of the military government
 are limited by the conflicting demands for justice and for national reconciliation.
 Military authorities continue to resist disclosing abuses from the past. In particular,
 the courts continue to struggle with the application of the 1978 Amnesty Law to
 cases that occurred during the first 5 years of military rule. Over the past 2 years,
 the Government and the opposition debated various proposals that would effectively
 close all cases covered by the Amnesty Law that are still under judicial investiga-
 tion. These efforts, however, have largely stalled, and the judicial system continues
 to investigate and close pending human rights cases.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political
 killings.
 The Committee for the Defense of People's Rights (CODEPU) reported that at
 least three individuals died as a result of the use of excessive force by the police,
 including one innocent bystander who died when caught in a crossfire between
 criminals and the police. In addition, army personnel shot and killed another indi-
 vidual who was trespassing on army property. These deaths received wide media
 coverage, and the cases are under investigation by the courts.
 The courts made several landmark decisions during the year on cases that oc-
 curred under the military regime. In June the Supreme Court invoked the Amnesty
 Law to end all action in the 1976 murder of Carmelo Soria, a Spanish citizen em-
 ployed by the United Nations. As a result, the authorities dismissed charges against
 two ex-agents of the National Intelligence Center (CNI) who were indicted in June
 1995 as author and accomplice in this crime; any further official investigation was
 terminated. This decision provoked concern and condemnation from a broad spec-
 trum, including the embassies of the European Union states, Chilean members of
 congress, and political parties. In September a group of parliamentarians belonging
 to the government coalition, charging denial of justice, introduced an impeachment
 motion against four Supreme Court justices, including Eliodoro Ortiz, the investigat-
 ing judge who decided that the Amnesty Law applied. Some observers criticized the
 legislators' effort, however, as an attempt to intimidate the judiciary.
 In another high-profile case, retired General Manuel Contreras and Brigadier
 Pedro Espinoza continue to serve their 7- and 6-year prison terms, respectively, as
 the intellectual authors of the 1976 murder in Washington, D.C. of former Chilean
 Foreign Minister Orlando Letelier and his U.S. citizen assistant, Ronni Moffit. Both
 filed petitions for pardon but neither has been approved. However, the authorities
 granted Contreras credit for the 50 days he serve while under house arrest pend-
 ing resolution of the U.S. Government's extradition request in 1978. In addition,
 Italian courts convicted Contreras and Raul Iturriaga, another former DINA (Na-
 tional Intelligence Directorate) officer, in absentia for the attempted murder of
 former Chilean Vice President Bernardo Leighton and his wife Anita Fresno, and
 sentenced each man to 18 years in prison. The Italians have requested neither their
 extradition nor that they serve their sentences in Chile.
 The January arrest in Argentina of former Chilean intelligence agent Enrique
 Arancibia Clavel once again drew attention to the 1974 assassination in Buenos
 Aires of former Chilean army chief Carlos Prats. Prats was the army commander
 under President Salvador Allende and was succeeded by General Pinochet in August
 
 
 382
 1973. He left Chile for Argentina several days after the coup against Allende. The
 case was reopened in 1992 as a result of a petition filed by the Prats family contain-
 ing new evidence. The Government has agreed to be a coplaintiff in the Argentine
 trial of Arancibia.
 In the case involving the 1982 murder of Tucapel Jimenez, the third chamber of
 the court of appeals unanimously denied bail to retired army Major Carlos Herrera
 on the grounds that he is a danger to society. Herrera, previously convicted of un-
 necessary violence which resulted in the 1984 death of political activist Mario
 Fernandez, began serving his 10-year sentence in Punta Peuco prison in January.
 After more than 9 years, a miitary udge dismissed the case of the June 1987
 deaths from "Operation Albania," in which CNI agents killed 12 people connected
 to the Manuel Rodriguez Patriotic Front (FPMR). This was in spite of a unanimous
 ruling in 1995 by the military tribunal-a higher court-that the deaths were homi-
 cides and that the cases should go to trial At the time, the authorities claimed that
 all 12 died in shoot-outs with security officers, and therefore no crime was commit-
 ted. The authorities implicated 28 former officers and enlisted men in this case. The
 decision to close the case has been appealed to the Supreme Court.
 On April 10, Supreme Court Justice Alfredo Pfeiffer reopened the investigation of
 the April 1991 assassination of Democratic Independent Union (UDI) founder and
 Senator Jaime Guzman, due to controversial public statements made by Jorge
 Barraza, the police detective in charge of the 199 1-93 investigation. According to
 Barraza, the assassination's intellectual author was FPMR leader Juan Gutierrez
 Frishman, also known as "El Chele," who also happned to be married at the time
 to Cuban armed forces chief Raul Castro's daughter. Barraza charged that his supe-
 riors in the Interior Ministry removed him prom the case in 1993 because they
 feared that his investigation would reveal crimes committed by confidential inform-
 ants. As a result of the initial investigation, the courts foundtwo members of the
 FPMR guilty and gave them life sentences. The courts found three other FPMR
 members guilty in absentia but the authorities never apprehended them. Gutierrez
 was not listed then as a conspirator. Barraza claims that when he presented a se-
 cret document to his Interior Ministry superiors in August 1993 detailing
 Gutierrez's role, he was transferred, and his investigative unit disbanded.
 Pfeiffer resigned in June, claiming death threats and political pressure to drop the
 case, and Raquel Camposano was appointed in his place. On December 18, as a re-
 suit of her investigation, Camposano issued an arrest warrant for Investigations Po-
 lice director Nelson Mery, charging him with obstruction of justice for withholding
 from judicial authorities a key surveillance videotape of the terrorist cell involved
 in the Guzman assassination. Separately, the judge also issued indictments against
 former Deputy Director of Public Security Marcelo Schilling, his assistant, and sev-
 eral subordinates for having illegally obtained information from leftwing terrorists
 in exchange for immunity from prosecution. President Frei declined to accept res-
 iguations from Mery and Schilling, an appeals court subsequently dismissed the
 cases, and the Supreme Court upheld the dismissal.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 The major human rights controversy involved past disappearances and efforts by
 all political forces and the Government to reinterpret the 1978 amnesty in such a
 way as to achieve both justice and national reconciliation. As interpreted under the
 so-called Aylwin Doctrine (named after former president Patricio Aylwin), the courts
 should not close a case involving a disappearance (those who disappeared are con-
 sidered to have been "kidnaped") until either the bodies are found or credible evi-
 dence is provided to indicate that an individual is dead. This could affect up to 542
 cases, which cover about 1,100 persons still classified as "detained or missing" from
 the early years of the military regime. The application of the Aylwin Doctrine, how-
 ever, has been uneven, as some courts continued the previous practice of applying
 the 1978 amnesty to disappearances without conducting an investigation to ideni
 the perpetrators. The court closed 16 cases during the first half of the year through
 application of the amnesty; 170 cases are active; and an additional 356 cases are
 temporarily closed but subject to being reopened.
 The Government attempted to alter implementation of the amnesty through a
 propsal negotiated by Minister of the Interior Carlos Figueroa and opposition lead-
 er Miguel Otero. The hill they introduced proposed to keep secret the identity of key
 witnesses, including those implicated in the crimes, in exchange for whatever con-
 fidential information they might provide on the fate of those who disappeared. This
 information, which would never be available to the public, would serve as the basis
 for the permanent closure of the case. However, the proposal was criticized by both
 the right and the left and never came to a vote.
 The Social Aid Foundation of Christian Churches (FASIC) brought four disappear-
 ance cases that had been closed in 1995 with the fate of the victims still unknown
 
 
 383
 to the attention of the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR).
 While the commission has made rulings on these cases, they have yet to be pub-
 lished. The FASIC also appealed an additional 14 cases to the IACHR.
 Some progress has been made in locating a number of those who disappeared. The
 remains of three bodies were discovered in early December 1995 on the grounds of
 a military camp situated 25 miles north of Santiago. The authorities identified two
 of them as Manuel Weibel Navarrete and Ignacio Orlando Gonzalez Espinoza, both
 former members of the Chilean Communist Party. There are suspicions that a large
 number of bodies were buried in military precincts, but the military authorities
 refuse access to these areas, thus preventing the possible closure of a number of
 these cases.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution forbids "the use of illegal pressure" on detainees, but CODEPU
 has received reports of instances of mistreatment and abuse by some Carabinero
 and Investigations Police units. CODEPU lawyers visit detainees during their inter-
 rogation (see Section 1.d.) and represent many suspected terrorists in court.
 CODEPU alleged that there were some cases of use of excessive force against de-
 tainees durin the year. It found a significant improvement in the record of the
 plainclothes investigations Police   while  complaints  against the uniformed
 Carabineros increased in number. The Minister of Interior normally asks the courts
 to conduct independent investigations of credible complaints of police abuse, but
 such investigations rarely result in arrests, due in part to the reluctance of judges
 to pursue the issue vigorously. The courts convicted and sentenced only four poice
 officials for committing acts of violence against detainees. However, as indicated in
 the CODEPU report, police authorities often impose administrative sanctions on
 abusive officers without waiting for a judicial ruling.
 According to a report by the Unite Nations Commission on Human Rights, while
 considerable progress has been made since the return to civilian rule in 1990, acts
 of torture still continue. A study by Diego Portales University indicated that 71 per-
 cent of detainees interrogated a suffered some form of ill treatment. The United
 Nations report concluded that although abuses are not systemic the Government
 has taken insufficient action to ensure that the activities of the Carabineros are in
 accord with the law. It recommends that the Carabineros be entirely subordinated
 to the Ministry of Interior.
 Prisons are overcrowded and antiquated, but the conditions are not life threaten-
 ing. Food meets minimal nutritional needs and prisoners may supplement the diet
 by buying food. Those with sufficient funds can often rent space in a better wing
 of the prison. Prison guards have been accused of using excessive force to stop at-
 tempted prison breaks. Although most reports state that the guards generally be-
 have responsibly and do not mistreat prisoners, several prisoners have complained
 of beatings. There are about 300 minors in adult prisons (see Section 5).
 The maximum securiy prisn hous 79 prisoners, most of them charged with or
 convicted of terrorism. Prisoners continue to complain that strict security measures,
 prohibition of visitors, hidden cameras, and the extremely rigid regulations violate
 their rights. Recently, the president of the Santiago Court of Appas confirmed the
 existence of listening devices in prison cells. In a reply to this report, the Minister
 of Justie confirmed that microphones were present but said that they were never
 used.
 In June 1995, a new prison at Punta Peuc, 25 miles north of Santiago, was com-
 pleted. This prison was constructed specifically for government and military officers
 sentenced to jail. As of Augut, it had 15 inmates including Brigadier Pedro
 Espinza and retired GeneralrManuel Contreras.
 The Government permits prison visits by independent human rights monitors.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution allows ciila and mili-
 t    courts to order detention for up to 5 days without arra nent and to extend
 the detention of suspected terrorists for up to 10 days. The   affords detainees
 30 minutes of immediate and daily access to a lawyer (in the presence of a prison
 guard) and to a doctorptotveri  their physical condition. The law does not permit
 a judge to deny such access; police authorities generally observed these require-
 ments.
 As of September, 9 percent of the general prison population were under investiga-
 tion but not charged with a crime, 50 percent were charged with an offense and
 were awaitingtrial or sentencing, and 41 percent were serving sentences.
 The police have the authority to make arrests based on suspicion, particularly of
 youth in high crime areas late at night. In practice, the detainees are net promptly
 advised of chrges against them, nor are they granted a speedy hearing before a
 judge. The Constitution provides for the right to legal counsel, but this is a reality
 only for those who can afford to pay. The poor, who account for the majority of
 
 
 384
 
 cases, may be represented by law students doing practical training (who are often
 overworked) or, on occasion, by a court appointed lawyer. Arrest procedures do not
 require police to allow detainees to telephone relatives or a lawyer. The Constitution
 allows judges to set bail.
 Law enforcement authorities often failed to inform foreign embassies when their
 nationals were arrested.
 There were no cases of forced exile.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution calls for a judicial system inde-
 pendent of the other branches of government.
 Cases decided in the lower courts can be referred to the appeals courts, and ulti-
 mately to the Supreme Court. Although the judiciary, and particularly the Supreme
 Court, has been dominated by apointees of the former military regime, the passage
 of time is chan gthis legacy. riminal court judges are appointed for life, and ap-
 pointments to   e upreme Court and the aplals courts are made by the President
 from lists prepared by the Supreme Court. Of the 16 justices on the Supreme Court,
 7 have been appointed since the end of the military regime. The Supreme Court con-
 tinues to work with the other branches of government on broad judicial reform.
 The jurisdiction of military tribunals is limited to cases involving military officers.
 If formal charges are filed in civilian courts against a military officer, including
 Carabineros, the military prosecutor asks, and the Supreme Court normally grants,
 jurisdiction to the military. This is of particular consequence in the human rights
 cases dating from 1973 to 1978, the period covered by the 1978 Amnesty Law. In
 addition, military courts have the authority to charge and try civilians for defama-
 tion of military personnel and for sedition, but their rulings can be appealed to the
 civilian Supreme Court.
 Based on the Napoleonic Code, the judicial system does not provide for trial by
 jury, nor does it assume innocence until proven otherwise. Criminal proceedings are
 inquisitorial rather than adversarial. The Constitution provides for the right to legal
 counsel, but the poor do not always get effective legal representation (see Section
 l.cL).
 CODEPU reports that there are four political prisoners; however, these individ-
 uals were convicted of crimes related to terrorist acts.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution prohibits such practices, government authorities generally respect
 these prohibitions, and violations are subject to effective legal sanctions. The 1995
 Privacy Law bars obtaining information by undisclosed taping, telephone intercepts,
 and other surreptitious means, as well as its dissemination.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech
 and the press, and the authorities generally respected these rights in practice.
 The press maintains its independence, criticizes the Government, and covers is-
 sues sensitive to the military, including human rights. The Privacy Law also applies
 to the media, which are not exempt from its provisions.
 The print and electronic media are largely independent of government control.
 The State is majority owner of La Nacion newspaper, but the newspaper is edi-
 torially independent. However, La Nacion's editorial policy rarely, if ever, disagrees
 with government policy. The Television Nacional network is state owned but not
 under direct government control. It receives no government subsidy and is self-fi-
 nancing through commercial advertising. It is editorially independent and is gov-
 erned by a board of directors which, although politically appointed, encourages the
 expression of varied opinions over the network.
 Military courts have the authority to charge and try civilians for defamation of
 military personnel and for sedition, but their rulings can be appealed to the civilian
 Supreme Court.
 A draft press law, building on one proposed by the Aylwin government in 1993,
 would transfer cases involving freedom of speech (including charges of defamation
 and sedition) for nonmilitary personnel from military to civilian courts. As the bill
 moved from the House to the Senate, it remained the subject of considerable con-
 troversy, with the press arguing that some of its provisions might undermine as-
 pects of freedom of expression. The bill was still under consideration in the Senate
 at year's end.
 It is a criminal offense to besmirch the honor of state institutions and symbols,
 such as the Congress, the military services, the flag, and the President. In Decem-
 ber 1995, the courts convicted a former cabinet minister in Pinochet's government
 of defaming state institutions after he charged that unnamed members of congress
 used drugs and jailed him until he agreed to accept a suspended sentence and a
 
 
 385
 nominal fine. The Santiago court of appeals overturned the verdict in January, but
 the Supreme Court reinstated it in May.
 On October 29, the Investigations Police arrested Gladys Marin, Secretary Gen-
 eral of the Communist Party, and jailed her on charges of having slandered army
 commander-in-chief Augusta Pinochet. The army brought charges against Matin
 under the National Security Law for public statements she made on September 11
 characterizing Pinochet as a psychopath and accusing him and the army of human
 rights violations. The army subsequently dropped the charges, and Main was re-
 leased on October 21. Prior to the charges being dropped, however, both the court
 of appeals and the first chamber of the Supreme Court upheld the warrant for
 Marin's arrest.
 In June a Santiago court ordered the arrest of Eduardo Meneses, leader of the
 rap group Panteras Negras. In January 1995, police officers, with the support of the
 Council for the Defense of the State, had ilied a suit against Meneses under the
 military penal code for insulting the police, citing the lyrics of his song "War in the
 Streets." The song was included in a December 1995 concert at which members of
 the police had been present.
 In the only case involving film censorship to reach the courts during the year, the
 Film Classification Board on November 11 voted to reclassify the banned 1988 film
 The Last Temptation of Christ" as suitable for theater showings for those over the
 age of 18. However, on November 14, the court of a peals accepted a motion by the
 conservative group "Chile's Future" ("El Porvenir de Chile") to prohibit the film's
 showing pending further judicial review. The controversy was front page news; the
 conservative group argued that the board's reclassification was illegal and that the
 film is an attack against the honor of the Catholic Church, Christ, and Christians.
 Party for Democracy Deputy Victor Barneto and other opponents of film censorship
 have proposed amending the Constitution to prohibit film censorship and to restrict
 the board's power tot hat of simply rating films.
 Francisco Martrell, the author of thebook "Diplomatic Impunity," returned from
 self-imposed exile in Argentina to present himse  or sentencing for slander against
 prominent figures in a case that dates back to 1993. Martorell's book alleged sexual
 promiscuity and other misconduct by a number of prominent figures in society and
 politics while recounting the exploits of the Arentine Ambassador to Chile in 1989-
 91. The prison sentence was suspended, but Martorell was fined about $25,000 (10
 million pesos). His book is still banned.
 The courts rarely issued orders prohibiting media coverage of cases in progress,
 although one prominent instance drew wide protests. When the courts renewed in-
 vestigation into the 1990 assassination of Senator Jaime Guzman, a gag order was
 imposed, then lifted 2 months later. The law does not set any limits on a judge's
 power to impose such prohibitions nor does it require the reasons for the ban to be
 cited. In reaction to the presence of the media when the Investigations Police ar-
 rested a Carabinero, the court of appeals reaffirmed provisions of the Code of Penal
 Procedure that prohibit police from publicly disclosing the findings of their inves-
 tigations.
 The Government does not restrict academic freedom
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 these rights, and the Government respects them in practice.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the
 Government respects this right in practice. All denominations practice their faiths
 without restriction. Although church and State are officially separate, the Roman
 Catholic Church receives official preferential treatment. A 1995 municipal ordinance
 made it illegal to cause disturbances in the streets, which has been interpreted by
 some evangelical groups as an attempt to prevent them from proselytizing and
 preaching in public.
 The small Jewish population is free to practice its religion but faces some dis-
 crimination in public life. In October a cabinet minister and a subcabinet member
 were reported to have made anti-Semitic comments in government meetings. Subse-
 quently a Jewish vice minister resigned his post. Knowled eable sources believed
 this was partly the result of internalplicy differences and partly because of the
 Government's failure even to acknowledge that the remarks had been made.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigation, and Re-
 patriation.-The Constitution provides for these rights, and the overnment gen-
 erally respects them in practice. For minor children to leave the country, either
 alone or with only one of their parents, they must have notarized permission from
 both parents.
 The Government cooperates with the United Nations High Commissioner for Ref-
 ugees and other humanitarian organizations in assisting refugees. The issue of the
 
 
 386
 provision of first asylum has never arisen. There were no reports of forced return
 of persons to a country where they feared persecution.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Chile is a constitutional democracy, and citizens have the right to change their
 government through periodic elections. There is universal suffrage for citizens 18
 years of age and over. The Government still oprates under some political restraints
 that were imposed by the previous regime. Under the 1980 Constitution various na-
 tional institutions--incding the President, the Supreme Court, and the armed
 forces-dominated National Security Council-appointed an additional nine senators
 (beyond those elected) to 8-year terms prior to the transition to democracy. These
 senators, whose terms expire in 1997, were appointed by thea-president Pinochet,
 and they join with the opposition on moat matters. The legislative branch, with the
 exception of the institutional senators, is freely elected and independent from the
 executive branch.
 The former military government wrote the 1980 Constitution and amended it
 slightly in 1989 after losing a referendum on whether General Pinochet should stay
 in office as president. It provides for a strong presidency and a legislative branch
 with limited powers. In addition, the Constitution includes provisions designed to
 protect the interests of the military and the rightwing political opposition.
 These provisions, according to their defenders and even some critics, assured sta-
 bility in the political process during the transition. Some of these provisions are
 characterized by critics as "authoritarian enclaves" left over from the previous re-
 gime; while advocates describe them as integral to the system of checks and bal-
 ances. They include limitations on the President's right to remove military service
 chiefs, including chief of the srmy (the position General Pinochet can hold until
 1998); an electoral system that gives the second place party (or coalition) in each
 district disproportionate representation in Congress; and the prvision for non-
 elected institutional senators.
 Women have had the right to vote in municipal elections since 1934 and in na-
 tional elections since 1949, and they are active in political life at the grassroots
 level. Women make up a majority of registered voters and of those who actually cast
 ballots, but there are few women in leadership positions. There are 9 women among
 the 120 deputies, 3 women in the 46-seat Senate (including one of the designated
 senators), and 3 of 21 cabinet ministers are women. The level of female participation
 is not increasing. The percentage of female candidates in the 1996 municipal elec-
 tions increased only slightly from 1994-to 17.7 percent from 16.7 percent.
 The over 1 million indigenous people have the legal right to participate freely in
 the political process, although relatively few are politically active. While their par-
 ticipation has increased since the 1990 democratic transition, there is only one
 memnber of Congress of indigenous descent. In 1994 the Government created the Na-
 tional Corporation for Indigenous Development and placed it under the Planning
 Ministy;, in 1995, indigenous people elected their representatives to this body.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The Chilean  Human Rights Commission, a nongovernmental organization (NGO),
 is affiliated with the International League of Human Rights and continues to gather
 evidence of police abuses. The CODE provides legal counsel to those accused of
 politically related crimes and to victims ofhuman rights abuses. NGO's say that the
 Government has cooperated with their efforts to investigate accusations of continued
 human rights violatio ns. Many international NGO's also continue to follow closely
 human rights issues.
 The National Commission on Truth and Reconciliation (Rettig Commission) issued
 a report in 1991 that helped many Chileans come to terms with human rights
 abuses under the military government. The successor to the commission, the Na-
 tional Corporation for Compensation and Reconciliation, continues to investigate
 cases. Its mandate was extended until the end of 1996 to allow it to complete inves-
 tigations of the last cases on which it has information. In August it delivered its
 final report, which confirmed 899 cases in addition to those documented by the
 Rettig Commission, bringing the total number of victims of killings and disappear-
 ance cases to 3,197. The corporation also provides compensation to family members
 of human rights victims.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution provides for equality before the law, but it does not specifically
 ban discrimination based on race, sex, religion, or social status.
 
 
 387
 Women.-The public is only beginning to appreciate the extent of abuses such as
 wife beating. The National Women's Service (SERNAM), created in 1991 to combat
 discrimination against women found in a 1992 study that 26.2 percent of women
 it surveyed said that they had been subjected to some form of physical violence by
 their husband or partner while another 33.5 percent reported some form of psycho-
 logical abuse. However, only 16 percent reported such violence to the police.
 SERNAM is now conducting courses on the legal, medical, and psychological aspects
 of domestic violence for Carabineros, who are usually the first public officials to in-
 tervene in such incidents. These courses have been expanded to include judicial and
 municipal authorities.
 The courts may order counseling for those involved in intrafamily violence. As of
 July 12, there were 8,147 court cases involving intrafamily violence in Santiago. The
 Carabineros also reported that its family affairs unit received more than 463 com-
 plaints of rape or sexual abuse during the first 8 months of the year.
 Legal distinctions between the sexes still exist, despite a 1989 decision to give
 human rights treaties to which Chile is a party precedence over local laws. The law
 permits legal separation, but not divorce, so those who wish to remarry must seek
 annulments. Since annulment implies that a marriage never existed under the law,
 former spouses are left with little recourse for financial support. Although a recent
 law created conjugal property as an option in a marriage, some women saw this as
 a step backward, since the law on separate property (which still exists) gives women
 the right to one-half their husbands assets but gives husbands no rights to theirs.
 Another SERNAM    study found that the average earnings of female heads of
 household are only 71 percent of those of male heads of household. Women with no
 schooling receiveda salary that was 87 percent of that of their male counterparts
 without schooling, while female heads of household with university training earned
 only 57 percent as much as their male contemporaries. SERNAM has a pilot pro-
 gram providing occupational training and child care in an effort to alleviate this dis-
 parity.
 Children.-The Government provides free education through high school (compul-
 sory up to the eighth grade). A survey by the National Minors Service indicated that
 sexual abuse of minors occurs but that few cases were reported. A United Nations
 Children's Fund (UNICEF) report shows that 34 percent of children under 12 years
 of age experience serious physical violence, although only 3.2 percent of the victims
 of intrafamily violence reported to the Carabineros family affairs unit were below
 the age of 18. The 1994 Law on Intrafamily Violence was designed in part to deal
 with this problem. UNICEF estimates that over 100,000 children are in the work
 force (see Section 6.d.).
 Congress enacted a law that sergates juvenile offenders from adult prisoners.
 Although juvenile offenders (i.e., those under the age of 18) had long received se-
 cial treatment in the courts, some of them had been incarcerated with adults. The
 Government has reduced the number of minors in adult prisons from 6,630 in 1992
 to around 300 in 1996.
 People With Disabilities.-Congress passed a law in 1994 to promote the integra-
 tion of people with disabilities into society, and the National Fund for the Handi-
 capped (FONDIS) has a $1.5 million budget. The 1992 census found that 288,000
 citizens said that they had some form of disability, but FONDIS estimates that the
 actual number is closer to I million. The disabled still suffer some forms of legal
 discrimination; for example, blind people cannot become teachers or tutors. Al-
 though the law requires that new public buildings provide access for the disabled,
 the public transportation system does not make provision for wheelchair access, and
 a new subway line under construction provides no facilitated access for the disabled.
 Indigenous People.-The Mapuches from the south comprise over 90 percent of the
 indigenous population, but there are small Aimara, Atacameno, Huilliche, Rapa
 Nui, and Kawaskhar populations in other parts of the countr. A committee com-
 posed of representatives of indigenous groups participated in drafting the 1993 law
 that recognizes the ethnic diversity of the indigenous population and gives indige-
 nous people a voice in decisions affecting their lands, cultures, and traditions. It pro-
 vides for eventual bilingual education in schools with indigenous populations, and
 it replaced a statute that emphasized assimilation of indigenous people. However,
 out of the population that identifies itself as indigenous (nearly 1 million, according
 to the 1992 census), about half remain separated from the rest of society, largely
 because of historical, cultural, educational, and geographical factors. In fact, the
 ability of indigenous people to participate in decisions affecting their lands, cultures,
 aitis ad the      ocation o natural resources is marginal.
 National/RaciallEthniE Minorities.-Chile assimilated a major European (mainly
 German) migration in the last century and a major Middle Eastern and Croatian
 migration in the early part of this century. Smaller racial and ethnic minority

 groups (Indians, Chileans of Asian descent, and African-Chileans) experience some
 societal intolerance.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Workers have a right to form unions without prior
 authorization and to join existing unions; 13 percent of the work force is organized.
 A 1995 law provides government employee associationswith the same rights as
 trade unions, and implementing regulations have been adopted. Only the police and
 military are not allowed to form unions.
 The 1992 Labor Code permits nationwide labor centrals, and the Unified Workers
 Central (CUT), the largest and most representative of them, legalized its status in
 April 1992. Unions are independent of the Government, but union leaders are usu-
 ally elected from lists based on party affiliation and often receive direction from par-
 ties' headquarters.
 Reforms to the Labor Code in 1990 removed many restrictions on the right to
 strike, although some remain. Employers may no longer fire striking workers with-
 out paying severance benefits. Employers must show cause to fire workers, but lay-
 offs are permissible. Union leaders claim that some employers invoke this clause to
 fire employees who are attempting to form unions or who are active in collective
 bargaining. There is no specific information from union sources on particular cases
 where layoffs were used by employers to dismiss workers for prounion activities.
 Moreover, such acts and antiunion discrimination in general are illegal.
 The CUT and many other labor confederations and federations maintain ties to
 international labor organizations.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Although the climate for col-
 lective bargaining has improved since the return to democratic government in 1990,
 most workers continue to negotiate individual contracts. Employers say that this is
 due to the worker's preference, distrust of union leaders, and to loyalty to their com-
 panies. Union leaders counter that the Labor Code-which among other things does
 not allow closed shops--prevents them from successfully organizing in many sectors.
 Employers may also include a clause in individual employment contracts that some
 classes of employees are not allowed to participate in collective bargaining, although
 this applies only to supervisory personnel. Employees may object to the inclusion
 of such clauses in their contracts and may appeal to the Ministry of Labor for their
 excision.
 The Ministry is able to arbitrate about one-half of the complaints that it receives.
 Workers are free to take unarbitrated cases before the courts and, if they succeed
 in proving that they were fired unjustly, the employer must pay the discharged em-
 ployees twice their normal severance payment. There are no statistics available con-
 cerning the disposition of complaints of antiunion behavior. There are allegations
 that employers fire workers for prounion activity and attempt to avoid a complaint
 by immediately paying them twice the normal severance pay.
 Temporary workers-defined in the Labor Code as those in agriculture and con-
 struction, as well as port workers and entertainers-may now form unions, but their
 riht to collective bargaining remains dependent on employers agreeing to negotiate
 with unions of temporary workers. The Labor Code provides sanctions for unfair
 bargaining practices, which protect workers from dismissal during the bargaining
 process, but labor leaders claim that companies invoke the needs of the company
 clause to fire workers after a union has signed a new contract, particularly when
 negotiations result in a prolonged strike.
 The same labor laws apply in the duty free zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Constitution and the Labor
 Code prohibit forced or compulsory labor, and there is no indication that it is prac-
 ticed.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The law allows children between
 the ages of 15 and 18 to work with the express permission of their parents or guard-
 ians. Children 14 years of age may also work legally with such permission, but in
 addition they must have completed their elementary education, and the work in-
 volved may not be physically strenuous or unhealthy. Additional provisions in the
 law protect workers under 18 years by restricting the types of work open to them
 (for example, they may not work in nightclubs) and by establishing special condi-
 tions of work (they may not work more than 8 hours in 1 day). Labor inspectors
 enforce these regulations and compliance is good in the formal economy. Many chil-
 dren are employed in the informal economy, however, which is difficult to regulate.
 UNICEF estimates that approximately 107,000 children between 12 and 19 years
 of age were in the work force. The majority of these were males from single parent
 households headed by women; these children worked more than 40 hours per week
 and did not attend school.

 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The law sets minimum wages, hours of work,
 and occupational safety and health standards. The legal workweek is 48 hours
 which can be worked in either 5 or 6 days. The maximum workday length is 10
 hours, but positions such as caretakers and domestic servants are exempted. All
 workers enjoy at least one 24-hour rest period during the workweek, except for
 workers at high altitudes who voluntarily exchange a workfree day each week for
 a number of consecutive workfree days every 2 weeks.
 A tripartite committee comprising government, employer, and labor representa-
 tives normally suggests a minimum wage based on projected future inflation and
 increases in productivity. On May 14, the Senate approved the Government's pro-
 posal with little dissent, setting the minimum monthly wage at about $160 (65,500
 pesos), which took effect on June 1. The minimum wage is acuated annually. This
 wage is designed to serve as the starting wage for an unskilled single worker enter-
 ing the labor force and does not provide a family with an acceptable standard of
 living. Only 11 percet of salaried workers earn the minimum wage.
 Occupational health and safety is protected under the law and administered by
 the Ministry of Health. Ministry of Labor inspectors enforce laws covering working
 conditions. The Government has increased resources for inspections and targeted in-
 dustries guilty of the worst abuses. As a result, enforcement is improving, and vol-
 untary  omphiane is fairly good. Insurance mutual funds provide workmen's com-
 pensation and occupational safety training for the private and public sectors. They
 reported a 24-percent decline in occupational injuries over the past 5 years, al-
 though 11 percent of the work force still submitted claims. Workers who remove
 themselves from situations that endanger their health and safety have their employ-
 ment protected, provided that they ask a workers' delegate to bring the problem to
 the attention of labor inspetors. A new law entered force on December 15 that in-
 creases the number of annual occupational health and safety inspections and pro-
 vides that they will be carried out hy an expanded labor inspection service in the
 Ministry of Labor.
