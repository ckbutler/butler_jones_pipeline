 COSTA RICA
 Costa Rica is a Iongstanding, stable constitutional democracy with a unicameral
 Legislative Assembly directly elected in free multiparty elections every 4 years. Jose
 Maria Figueres of the National Liberation Party won the              February
 1994 elections, in which approximately 80 percent of eligible voters cast ballots. The
 Government respects constitutional provisions for an independent judiciary.
 .The 1949 Constitution abolished  osa Rica's military forces. The Ministry of Pb-
 lic Security and the Ministry of the Presidency share responsibility for law enforce-
 ment and national security. The Judicial Police, under the Supreme Court, conducts
 investigations, while the S an Jose Metropolitan Police and the Transit Police within
 the Ministry of Public Works and Transportation also have limited police powers.
 Public security forces generally observe procedural safeguards established by law
 and the Constitution.
 The market-based economy depends primarily on agriculture, light industry, and
 tourism. The pace of economic growth slowed from a 4.5 percent increase in 1994
 to a projected rise of 2.0 percent in 1995. The Government also faced a growing fis-
 cal deficit. The Constitution protects the right to own private property; however, do-
 mestic and foreign property owners enounter diicultygamming adequate, timely
 compensation forelands expropriated for national parks an-those set aside for indig-
 enous people or invaded by squatters.

 Citizens enjoy a wide range of individual rights and freedoms. The Government
 fully respects the human rights of its citizens, and the law and judiciary provide
 effective means of dealing with instances of abuse of individual rights. Nonetheless,
 the judicial system moves very slowly to process criminal cases, resulting in lengthy
 pretrial detentions for some suspects. There were two reported instances of abuse
 by police. The Government has identified domestic violence against women as a seri-
 ous societal problem and sponsored a public awareness program to deter such abuse.
 Discrimination against women and indigenous people remains a problem.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political or
 other extrajudicial killings.
 There was progress in resolving some cases from previous years. In July authori-
 ties agin jailed four former Judicial Police officers for the 1994 murder of suspected
 drug dealer Ciro Monge, and charged them also with the 1994 murder of a drug
 abuser. In August a court found a former member of the now-defunct Immediate Ac-
 tion Unit (UAI guilty of simple homicide for killing a 12-year-old child during a
 drug raid in May 1990. The former agent received a suspended 5-year sentence, and
 the court ordered the Government and three former agents to pay about $45,000
 (8.2 million colones) in damages to the victim's family. There was no progress in the
 Malcolm and "Cobra Command" cases (described in last year's report).
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punshment.-
 The Constitution prohibits cruel or degrading treatment and holds invalid any state-
 ment obtained through violence. Authorities generally abide by these prohibitions.
 The Ombudsman's Office investigates complaints and, where appropriate, initiates
 suits against officials. In one instance during pretrial detention, however, police per-
 sonnel severely beat a person who allegedly shot a policeman, according to a first-
 hand report.
 In August plainclothes members of the Police Information Center (CIP) used
 undue force against unruly labor demonstrators in front of the Presidential Office
 in response to unruly demonstrators. Following a public outcry, the Ministry of Pub-
 lic Security fired four CIP members and disbanded the group, transforming it into
 merely an archive for information on criminal activities.
 A large percentage of police personnel owe their appointments to political patron-
 age. The Figueres administration began implementation of a new Police Code, en-
 acted in 1994, designed to professionalize and depoliticize the police force. The Gov-
 ernment implemented a program to'establish permanent, professional cadres, which
 is intended eventually to result in a nonpolitically appointed career force. In Sep-
 tember the Ministry of Public Security initiated a revamped basic course for new
 police recruits, including training using a human rights manual developed by the
 Ministry.
 Prisoners generally receive humane treatment. While guards rarely abuse pris-
 oners physically, there are credible reports that prisoners are sometimes subjected
 to other forms of abuse such as extortion. The Prison Rights Ombudsman inves-
 tigates complaints and refers serious cases of any abuse to the public prosecutor.
 Authorities dismissed two guards on suspicion of drug trafficking; charges against
 them have not been proven. Penitentiaries remain overcrowded-about 60 percent
 above their overall planned capacities.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution and law prohibit arbi-
 trary arrest, detention, or exile, and the Government generally respects these prohi-
 bitions.
 The law requires issuance of judicial warrants before making arrests. The Con-
 stitution entitles a detainee to a judicial determination of the legality of the deten-
 tion during arraignment before a court officer within 24 hours of arrest. The au-
 thorities generally respect these rights.
 The law provides for the right to release on bail, and authorities observe it in
 practice. Generally, the authorities do not hold detainees incommunicado. With judi-
 cial authorization, the authorities may hold suspects for 48 hours after arrest or,
 under special circumstances, for up to 10 days.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution and law provide for an independ-
 ent judiciary, and the Government respects this provision in practice. The Constitu-
 tion provides for the right to a fair trial, and an independent judiciary vigorously
 enforces this right.
 The Supreme Court supervises the work of the lower courts, known as tribunals.
 The Legislative Assembly elects the 22 Supreme Court magistrates to 8-year terms,
 
 
 377
 subject to automatic renewal unless the Assembly decides otherwise by a two-thirds
 majority. Accused persons may select attorneys to represent them, and the law pro-
 vides for access to legal counsel at state expense for the indigent.
 Persons accused of serious offenses and held without bail, however, sometimes re-
 main in pretrial custody for long periods. Lengthy legal procedures, numerous ap-
 peals, and large numbers of detainees cause delays and case backlogs. There were
 992 accused persons, representing 25 percent of the prison population, jailed await-
 ing trial at the end of the year.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitray Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution prohibits such practices. Government authorities generally respect
 these prohibitions, and violations are subject to effective legal sanction. The law re-
 quires judicial warrants to search private homes. Judges may a  rove use of wire-
 taps in limited circumstances, primarily to combat narcotics trafficking.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech
 and the press, and the Government respects these rights in practice. An independ-
 ent press, a generally effective judiciary, and a functioning democratic political sys-
 tem combine to ensure freedom of speech and of the press, including academic free-
 dom. Nonetheless, courts sometimes interpret libel and defamationlaws so broadly
 that they potentially inhibit free expression. For example, while exonerating the di-
 rector of~aPrnsa Libre of defaming the Association of Small Farmers of the At-
 lantic, a court nonetheless ordered the director to pay civil damages of nearly
 $31,000 (5.66 million colones) to the group and its former director. La Prensa Libre
 had accused the group in 1988 of being a "paramilitary organization."
 In May the Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court ruled unconstitutional
 a provision from a 1969 law that required a degree in journalism from a Costa
 Rican university and the licensing of journalists with the government-sponsored
 journalists' guild. Thvis requirement had long been criticized in Costi  and
 abroad as an infringement on press freedom.
 Nine major prh'ately owned newspapers, several periodicals, 6 privately owned
 television stations, and over 70 privately owned radio stations pursue independent
 editorial policies. The media freely criticize the Government, and there is no evi-
 dence of governmental intimidation.
 The Oice of Control of Public S ctacles rates films and has the authority to re-
 strict or prohibit their showing; it eas similar powers over television programs and
 sage plays. Nonetheless, foreign and particularly American films spanning the U.S.
 rating system are offered to the public. A tribunal reviews appeals of the Office's
 actions.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 these rights, and the Government respects them in practice.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the
 Government respects this right in practice. While the Constitution establishes
 Roman Catholicism as the state religion, people of all denominations freely practice
 their religion without government interference. Foreign missionaries and clergy of
 all denominations work and proselytize freely.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the County, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Constitution provides for these rights, and the Government re-
 spects them in practice. There are no restrictions on travel within the country nor
 on emigration or the right of return. There is a long tradition of providing refuge
 to people from other Latin American countries. In July the Government grantedUpo-
 litical asylum to a Cuban diplomat after another country refused his request. The
 Constitution specifically prohibits repatriation of anyone subject to potential perse-
 cution. There were no reports of forced expulsion of those having a valid claim to
 refugee status. The authorities regularly retatriated undocumented Nicaraguans,
 most of whom entered the country primarily or economic reasons.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The Constitution provides citizens with the right to change their government
 peacefully, and citizens exercise this right in practice through free and fair elections
 held on the basis of universal suffrage and by secret ballot every 4 years. The inde-
 pendent Supreme Electoral Tribuna ensures the integrity of elections, and the au-
 thorities and citizens respect election results. The Constitution bars the President
 from seeking reelection, and Assembly Members may only seek reelection after one
 term outo orffie. In the 1994 elections, President Figueres' National Liberation
 Party gained a plurality in the Legislative Assembly, winning 28 of 57 seats. The
 
 
 378
 Social Christian Unity Party won 25 seats, the Democratic Force won 2 seats, and
 2 provincial parties each garnered one seat.
 Women encounter no legal impediments to their participation in politics. While
 women are underrepresented in leadership positions of the Government and politi-
 cal parties, this situation has begun to change. Currently, one vice president, two
 cabinet ministers, seven vice ministers, nine Legislative Assembly members, and
 seven directors of autonomous institutions are women. Indigenous people may par-
 ticipate freely in politics and government. In practice they have not played signifi-
 cant roles in these areas, except on issues directly affecting their welfare, largely
 because of their relatively small numbers and physical isolation. Costa Rica's 30,000
 blacks, largely resident on the Caribbean coast, enjoy full rights of citizenship, in-
 cluding the protection of laws against racial discrimination. The Legislative Assem-
 bly includes one black member, one member of the cabinet is black.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Various human rights groups operate without government restriction, investigat-
 ing and publishing their findings on human rights cases. Government officials are
 cooperative and responsive to their views. The Costa Rican Commission for Human
 Rights, the Commission for the Defense of Human Rights in Central America, and
 the Family and Friends of Political Prisoners of Costa Rica, monitor and report on
 human rights. Several international organizations concerned with human rights, in-
 cluding the Inter-American Institute for Human Rights and the Inter-American
 Court of Human Rights, are located in San Jose.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution pronounces all persons equal before the law and the Government
 generally respects these provisions.
 Women.-The Government has identified domestic violence against women and
 children as a serious societal problem. In July the First Lady and the National Cen-
 ter for the Development of Women and the Family initiated a public awareness cam-
 paign "For a Life Without Violence." Beg ing in September, authorities incor-
 porated training on handling of cases of domestic violence in the basic training
 course for new police personnel. The Government regularly prosecutes physical
 abuse of women, including domestic violence, and often imposes stringent punish-
 ment.
 Women constitute 49.5 percent of the population. The 1990 Law for the Promotion
 of the Social Equality of Women not only prohibits discrimination against women
 but obligates the Government to promote political, economic, social, and cultural
 equality. This year the Government's National Center for the Development of
 Women and the Family promulgated social awareness programs on "Active Partici-
 pation by Women in Decisionmaking" and "Technical Training and the Fight
 Against Poverty."
 According to the 1993 census, 30 percent of working-age women earn wages out-
 side the home, compared with 79 percent of working-age men. One-fifth of a 1 fami-
 lies depend primarily on the earmngs of women. Most women work in the services
 sector, with others working in industry and agriculture. While laws require that
 women and men receive equal pay for equal work, average salaries for women re-
 mained below those of male counterparts. The average life expectancy for women
 increased by 12 years since the early 1970's to 77 years, higher than the 74-year
 average for men.
 Children.-The Government is committed to children's rights and welfare through
 its well-funded systems of public education and medical care. The Government
 spends more than 4 percent of gross domestic product on education and over 5 per-
 cent on medical care. Accordingly, Costa Rica has a high rate of literacy (94 percent)
 and a low rate of infant mortality (12.99 per 1,000). The autonomous National Insti-
 tute for Children oversees the implementation of the Government's programs for
 children. In August the Catholic Church began construction of a home for both teen-
 age mothers and for children with AIDS, which the Church will operate with help
 from the National Institute for Children.
 In recent years, the National Institute for Children has increased public aware-
 ness of crimes against children. The Institute intervened in 2,405 cases of abandon-
 ment, 696 cases of physical abuse, 842 cases of sexual abuse, and 71 cases of psy-
 chological abuse of children during the first 6 months of 1995. Abuses appear to be
 more prevalent among impoverished, less-educated families. Traditional attitudes
 and the inclination to treat such crimes as misdemeanors sometimes hamper legal
 proceedings against those who commit crimes against children.
 
 
 379
 People With Disabilities.-No laws prohibit discrimination against those with dis-
 abilities nor mandate access to buildings for such persons. Certain public and pri-
 vate institutions, however, have made individual efforts to improve access.
 Indigenous People.-Costa Rica's population of about 3.3 million includes nearly
 29,000 indigenous people divided among eight ethnic groups. Most live in traditional
 communities on 22 reserves which, because of their remote location, often lack ac-
 cess to schools, health care, electricity, and potable water. The Government through
 the National Indigenous Commission initiated distribution of national identification
 cards to facilitate access to public medical facilities. The Government also began
 construction of a medical clinic and two community health centers in indigenous
 areas. The Ombadsman has established an office to investigate violations of the
 rights of indigenous people.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The law specifies the right of workers to join unions
 of their choosing without prior authorization, although barriers exist in practice.
 About 15 percent of the work force is unionized, almost entirely in the public sector.
 Unions operate independently of government control and may form federations and
 confederations and affiliate internationally.
 Some trade union leaders contend that "solidarity" associations, in which workers
 renounce the right to strike and bargain collectively in return for receiving certain
 services including credit unions and savings plans, hurt the right of association.
 After the International Labor Organization (ILO) Committee on Freedom of Associa-
 tion ruled that solidarity associations and their involvement in trade union activi-
 ties violated freedom of association, the Government amended the Labor Code in
 1993. The following year, the ILO Committee of Experts ruled that these and other
 planned changes fostered greater freedom of association. In 1995 this Committee en-
 couraged the Government to approve legislation to allow unions to administer com-
 pensation funds for dismissed workers and to repeal Labor Code provisions restrict-
 ing the right to strike in certain nonessential public, agricultural, and forestry sec-
 tors.
 Costa Rica has no restrictions on the right of private sector workers to strike, but
 very few workers in this sector belong to unions. Accordingly, private sector strikes
 rarely occur. The Constitution and Labor Code restrict the right of public sector
 workers to strike. Nonetheless, in mid-1995, teachers' unions conducted a largely
 peaceful, month-long strike to protest changes to a law on teachers' pensions.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The Constitution protects the
 right to organize. Specific provisions of the 1993 Labor Code reforms provide protec-
 tion from dismissal for union organizers and members during union formation. The
 revised provisions require employers found guilty of discrimination to reinstate
 workers fired for union activities.
 Public sector workers cannot engage in collective bargaining because the Public
 Administration Act of 1978 makes labor law inapplicable in relations between the
 Government and its employees. Private sector unions have the legal right to engage
 in collective bargaining.
 All labor regulations apply fully to the country's nine export processing zones
 (EPZ's). The Labor Ministry oversees labor regulations within the EPZ's, but ac-
 knowledged that it has only one inspector for every 30,000 workers.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Constitution prohibits forced
 or compulsory labor, and there were no known instances of such practices.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The Constitution provides special
 employment protection for women and children and establishes the minimum work-
 ing age at 12 years, with special regulations in force for workers under 15. Children
 between 15 and 18 can work a maximum of 7 hours daily and 42 hours weekly,
 while children between 12 and 15 can work a maximum of 5 hours daily and 30
 hours weekly. The National Institute for Children, in cooperation with the Labor
 Ministry, effectively enforces these regulations in the formal sector. After two ado-
 lescents died from chemical poisoning while working on banana plantations, the au-
 thorities prohibited employment of youths under 18 in the banana industry. None-
 theless, child labor remains an integral part of the large informal economy.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The Constitution provides for a minimum
 wage. A National Wage Council, composed of three members each from government,
 business, and labor, sets minimum wage and salary levels for all sectors. Monthly
 minimum wages, last adjusted in July for the private sector, range from $121
 (21,928 colones) for domestic servants to $587 (106,282 colones) for certain profes-
 sionals. Public sector negotiations, based on private sector minimum wages, nor-
 mally follow the settlement of private sector negotiations. The Ministry of Labor ef-
 fectively enforces minimum wages in the San Jose area, but less effectively in rural
 
 
 380
 
 areas. Workers at the lower end of the wage scale, especially those with families,
 encounter difficulty maintaining acceptable standards of living and in taking care
 of their basic human needs.
 The Constitution sets workday hours, overtime remuneration, days of rest, and
 annual vacation rights. Although often circumvented in practice, it also requires
 compensation for discharge without due cause. Generally, workers may work a max-
 imum of 8 hours during the day and 6 at night, up to weekly totals of 48 and 36
 hours, respectively. Nonagricultural workers receive an overtime premium of 50 per-
 cent of regular wages for work in excess of the daily work shift. Agricultural work-
 ers do not receive overtime, however, if they voluntarily work beyond their normal
 hours. Little evidence exists that employers coerce employees to perform such over-
 time.
 For several years, the ILO Coiniittee of Experts has asked the Government to
 enact provisions regarding accident prevention for seafarers, as required by ILO
 Convention 134 on the "Prevention of Accidents (Seafarers)." At year's end, the
 Committee had not yet received the requested regulations.
 A 1967 law on health and safety in the workplace requires industrial, agricul-
 tural, and commercial firms with 10 or more workers to establish a management-
 labor committee and allows the Government to inspect workplaces and to fine em-
 ployers for violations. Most firms subject to the law establish such committees, but
 either do not use the committees or neglect to turn them into effective instruments
 for improving workplace conditions. While workers have the right to leave work if
 conditions become dangerous, workers who do so may find their jobs in jeopardy un-
 less they file written complaints with the Labor Ministry. Due partly to budgetary
 constraints, the Ministry has not fielded enough labor inspectors to ensure consist-
 ent maintenance of minimum conditions of safety and samtation, especially outside
 San Jose.
