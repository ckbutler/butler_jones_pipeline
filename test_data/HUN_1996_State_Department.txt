 HUNGARY
 Hungary is a parliamentary democracy with a freely elected legislative assembly.
 Prime Minister Oyula Horn, the leader of the Hungarian    diagst Party, oeads a
 
 
 969
 coalition government formed after the 1994 national elections. The Government re-
 spects the constitutional provisions for an independent judiciary.
 The internal and external security services report directly to a minister without
 portfolio, and the police report to the Interior Minister. There continued to be credi-
 ble reports of police abuses.
 The Government has demonstrated through its macroeconomic policies and exten-
 sive privatization its commitment to the transition to a market economy. The pri-
 vate sector generates about 70 percent of gross domestic product. Services, trade,
 and government employ about 60 percent of the labor force, and industry nearly 30
 percent. Major exports include manufactured goods (49 percent) and machinery and
 transport equipment (26 percent). An estimated 25 percent of the population live in
 poverty, with elderly pensioners, dependent housewives and children, and Roma
 most affected.
 Although the Government generally respects human rights and civil liberties of
 its citizens, the authorities do not ensure due process in all cases. Prosecutors and
 judges impose-but rarely-what amounts to unlimited pretrial detention. Police on
 occasion enter private residences to check foreigners' identification without war-
 rants. Although senior levels of the Interior Ministry and the National Police were
 more willing to address problems, police continued to use excessive force against
 suspects. Police harassed and abused both Roma and foreign nationals.
 The print media enjoy a relatively high degree of independence. However, the
 Government still controls national television and most radio stations. The 1995
 broadcast media law creates the conditions necessary to insulate the electronic
 media from state control or manipulation. The Government plans to privatize por-
 tions of the electronic media including one of the two state television channels in
 1997. Opposition politicians criticized the Government's 'monopolistic ownership" of
 the press and manipulation of distribution networks that limit opposition access to
 the media. Societal discrimination against Roma remains a serious problem. Anti-
 Semitic and racist attacks continued to decline. Spousal abuse of women is a serious
 problem, while discrimination against women is common in the workplace, as well
 as in most aspects of daily life.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extra judicial Killing.-There were no reports of political or
 other extrajudicial killings.
 After a suspect reportedly was beaten to death in Paszto in July 1995, one of the
 police officers involved was dismissed, three were suspended, and the police com-
 mander resigned. After 12 months of investigation, formal charges were brought in
 October. In Novemr~the trial was suspended until February 1997 to permit fur-
 ther investigation.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Other Degrading Treatment or Punish-
 ment.-No known incidents of torture occurred. Police abuses continued, including
 harasment, usve force, and beatings of suspects. Police also continued
 to harass and physically abuse Roma and foreign nationals.
 In July the national chief f police announced a ban on the use of benzidin, a pow-
 erful chemical smeared on the akin of some suspects, because of its dubious benefit
 to criminal investigation. Benzidin is used to find traces of bloed on human skin.
 In high doses, it can cause cancer. Hungarian human rights organizations allege
 that benzidin is used to coerce or force confessions from criminal suspects. Benzidin
 was used in several cases in Nograd county, resulting in itching, brnin, and se-
 vere rashes on the suspects exposed to the chemical. In one case in ArntalFad
 admitted his crime, but police treated him with benzidin as part of the ensuing
 criminal investigation. Police repeatedly denied Fajd medical treatment after the
 bnzidin application resulted in rashes that festered on his arm. Romani suspects
 also were treated with bnsidin in December 1995 with similarly strong reactions.
 In July Imre Furmann, director of the Legal Defense Bureau for National and Eth-
 nic Minorities, reported that another person sought legal assistance after his gni-
 awere smeared with bnzidin.
 The National Police have stiffened internal controls over the past several years.
 Of 41,000 police officers, 164 were accused of physical abuse in 1995, a three-fold
 increase over the previous year. The Hungarian Helsinki Committee reported in
 1995 that police misconduct ** * takes place every day, although the public is
 only informed by chance, only in conspicuous cases. Guilty police officers are very
 rarely condemned, and the majority of the officers suspected of such crimes remain
 
 
 on duty." In the first half the year 19 police officers were convicted for using exces-
 sive force.
 Public sector salaries remain stagnant, and police are poorly paid. They fre-
 quently harass residents, charging questionable flnes for erroneous traffic violations
 to earn petty cash. Police Bhowedindifference towards foreigners who have been vic-
 tims of street crime.
 Although prisons are overcrowded, conditions meet minimum international stand-
 ards, and the Government permits visits by human rights monitors. In a report cov-
 ering the first half of the year for a local human rights organization, Dr. Agnes
 Kover identified 28 cases of physical abuse of detainees in prisons, although only
 1 detainee brought charges aainst the lice.
 d. Arbitrary Arres, Detenfon, or Exile.-Police must inform suspects upon arrest
 of the charges against them and may hold them for a maximum of 72 hours before
 filing charges. The law requires that all suspects be allowed access to counsel prior
 to questioning and throuhout all sueent proceedings. The authorities must
 provide ounsel for juveniles, the indigen, andfthe men aly disabled. There are
 credible reports that police do not always allow access to counsel, particularly for
 minor crimes. There is no bail system; however, depending upon the nature of the
 crime, courts may release detainees upon their own recgnizance.
 Pretrial detention, based on a warrant issued by a judge, is initially limited to
 1 year while criminal investigations are in progress; it ma be extended indefinitely
 on the prosecutr's motion (provided the judge oncurs). he lack of a bail system
 gives tremendous leeway to the judge. In ad ition, foreigners charged with crimes
 are considered likely to flee the country, which means that they are usually held
 until their trial. Roma allege that they are kept in pretrial detention longer and
 more frequently than non-Roma (see Section 1.e.). The law provides for compensa-
 tion when the accused is released for lack of evidence, but the procedure is exercised
 rarely since victims must undertake a complicated legal procedure to pursue their
 claims.
 The Penal Code does not provide for exile, and it is not employed.
 e. Denial of Fair Public 7ral.-The Constitution provides for an independent judi-
 ciary, and the Government respects this provision in practice. The judiciary provides
 citizens with a fair, although sometimes slow, process. Although counsel is ap-
 pointed for indigent clients, public defenders are Iow paid and do not give indigent
 endants priority; lawyers often meet such cients for the first time at trial.
 Under the Constitution, the courts are responsible for the administration of jus-
 tice, with the Supreme Court exercising control over the operations and judicature
 of all the courts. There are three levels of courts. Original jurisdiction in most mat-
 ters rests with the local courts. Appeals of their ruings may be made to the county
 courts or to the Budapest municipal court, which have original jurisdiction in other
 matters. The highest level of appeal is the Supreme Court, whose decisions on non-
 constitutional issues are binding. In the case of military trials, appeals also may be
 addressed to the Supreme Court.
 The Constitutional Court is charged with reviewing the constitutionality of laws
 and statutes brought before it. Citizens may appeal directly to the Constitutional
 Court if they believe that their constitutional rights have been violated. Parliament
 elects the Cour's members to 9-year terms, which may be renewed. In September
 the Parliament began debate on whether to increase the number of seats on the
 Constitutional Court, as well as providing life tenure for its members (the current
 retirement age is 70), thereby addressing concerns that vacancies on the bench
 could delay the Court's work. No judge or member of the Supreme or Constitutional
 Court may belong to a political party or engage in political activity. Although the
 Government has alleged that judges' political attitudes have affected decisions,
 these charges are undercut by unanimous decisions in controversial cases, with
 judges appointed by the government siding with those appointed by the opposition.
 The law provides for the right to a fair trial, and the authorities respected this
 right in practice. In selected cases judges may agree to a closed trial to protect the
 accused or the crime victim, such as in some rape cases. There is no jury system;
 hence judges are the final arbiters.
 Military trials follow civil law and may be closed if national security or moral
 grounds so justify. In all cases sentencing must take place publicly. Defendants are
 entitled to counsel during all phases of criminal proceedings and are presumed inno-
 cent until proven guilty. Judicial proceedings are generally investigative rather than
 adversrial in nature.
 Many human rights and Romani organizations claim that Roma receive less than
 equal treatment in the judicial process. Specifically, they allege that Roma are kept
 in pretrial detention more often and for longer periods of time than non-Roma. This
 allegation is credible in light of general discrimination against Roma; however, there
 
 
 is no statistical evidence because identifying the ethnicity of offenders is not allowed
 inpolice records.
 ln March the Parliament amended the Penal Code to crack down on hate crimes,
 spurred in part by the acquittal on technical grounds that month of neo-Nazi Albert
 Szab on charges of disseminating anti-Semitic, fascistic materials.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home or Correspondence.-The law
 provides that the prosecutor's office may issue search warrants. Police must carry
 out house searches in the presence of two witnesses and must prepare a written in-
 ventory of items removed from the premises. Wiretapping, which may be done for
 national security reasons and for legitimate criminal investigations requires a
 court's permission. These provisions appear to be observed in practice. however, po-
 lice at times enter private residences without warrants to chVeck foreigners' identi-
 fication.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech
 and the press, and the Government generally respects this right in practice. The
 last state-owned Budapest daily, Magyar Nemzet, was sold to a private owner in
 1995. Four national political, 1 national economic, and 3 tabloid newspapers as well
 as 18 local dailies have been privatized. The print media enjoy considerable free-
 dom; however, journalists and opposition politicians are concerned that the expres-
 sion of different views in the press may be circumscribed by the small number of
 owners who control most of the print media.
 Parliament passed a media law in December 1995 creating institutions designed
 to foster a free and independent electronic media. The law provides for the creation
 of national, commercial television and radio and insulates the remaining public
 service media from government control. There are no private national television sta-
 tions, although the Government is negotiating the sale of two countrywide television
 channels an several government-owned radio stations. At present, there is one pri-
 vate national radio station and one national radio station in which the Government
 maintains a minority share. The Government recently announced plans to establish
 a third private television channel However, at year's end state-owned Hungarian
 Radio and Hungarian Television continued to enjoy a near monopoly of nationwide
 broadcasting, and the Prime Minister controlled their budgets.
 While some limited-range local television licenses were issued, partisan political
 wrangling and, less importantly, pressures from television and radio unions and em-
 ployee associations continued to block the availability of national broadcast fre-
 quencies. (However, over half of the country's households have access to satellite tel-
 evision, cable, or both.)
 Academic freedom is generally respected.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-There are essentially no re-
 strictions on peaceful public gatherings. In general the Government does not require
 permits for assembly except when a public gathering is to take place near sensitive
 installations, such as military facilities, embassies, and key government buildings.
 Police may sometimes alter or revoke permits, but there is no evidence that they
 abuse this right.
 Any 10 or more persons may form an association, provided that it does not com-
 mit criminal offenses or disturb the rights of others. Associations with charters and
 elected officers must register with the courts.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and
 members of all faiths are allowed to practice their religion freely. There is no offi-
 cially preferred religion, but only officially approved religions receive state subsidies.
 The Government distributed $113 million in state subsidies in 1995 among approxi-
 mately three dozen religious groups for salaries, rehabilitation, education, and social
 work. Religious orders and schools have regained some property confiscated by the
 Communist regime.
 In September the President officially reopened Budapest's Dohany Street syna-
 ggue. Two-thirds of the $800,000 reconstruction cost was financed by the Govern-
 ment with the rest funded by international donations. In October the Parliament
 passed the Jewish Restitution Decree; the Government has earmarked over $250
 million for restitution. In December Parliament began debate on enabling legislation
 that will fund a new Jewish foundation. The foundation is expected to distribute
 funds to Hungaan Holocaust survivors and oversee property and restitution claims
 by heirs of Holocaust victims.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 prtriation.-There are no restrictions on the movement of citizens within or outside
 ungary, including on the rights of emigration and repatriation. The Government
 
 
 may delay but not deny emigration for those who have significant court-assessed
 debts or who possess state secrets. It requires that foreigners from countries that
 do not have a visa waiver arement with Hungary obtain exit visas each time they
 leave the country, although blanket permission is sometimes available.
 The fighting in the former Yugoslavia resulted in a continued flow of refugees into
 Hungary. While approximately 5,000 refugees from the former Yugoslavia are reg-
 istered in Hungary, the Government estimates that over 20,000 more are present
 in unregistered status. Most of the refugees are in private housing, with only 1,380
 (as of September) housed in 3 refugee camps. In September the Government moved
 virtually all remaining refugees from their facility in Nagyatad to more modern fa-
 cilities in Debrecen. Only a handful of refugees, mostly the mentally ill and those
 awaiting resettlement in third countries remain in Nagyatad.
 Hungary is a signatory to the 1951 UJnited Nations Convention Relating to the
 Status of Refugees and to its 1967 Protocol, with a caveat that it will grant refugee
 status only to European nationals. The Government cooperates with the office of the
 U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees and other humanitarian organizations in as-
 sisting refugees. Hungary provided first asylum to refugees from the former Yugo-
 slavia during the figting in that neighboring countr. Prospective refugees who
 seek only to transit to Western Europe are encouraged to return to their countries
 of departure.
 Illegal aliens, mostly non-European, were housed at border guard facilities
 throughout Hungary. In 1996 6,927 illegal aliens were processed pending either de-
 portation or qualification for resettlement in a third country. The determination is
 made by the local office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees
 (UNHCR). While police seek the timely deportation of detainees who do not qualify
 for refugee status, a shortage of funds and the detainees' lack of proper documenta-
 tion, such as passprts, ofen result in lengthy stays. In September Amnesty Inter-
 national reported the forced repatriation of two Sudanese citizens who sought asy-
 lum. The two were returned to Syria, from where they had travelled to Budapest,
 and are expected to be repatriated to Sudan. The Govement disputes the fact that
 this was a case of illegal forcible repatriation that placed the two at risk. In Decem-
 ber a local nongovernmental organization (NGO) charged that 10 Iraqi citizens were
 held captive in handcuffs with their legs chained and their mouths taped before
 they were sent to Damascus without any assessment of the threat they faced if re-
 turned to Iraq. The Government denies the alleged mistreatment.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens age 18 and over have the right to change their government through na-
 tional elections held at least every 4 years. The Parliament's members are elected
 through a complex voting procedure for individuals and party lists. In the 1994 na-
 tional elections, Prime Minster Gyula Horn's Hungarian Socialist (formerly Com-
 munist) Party won an absolute majority and formed a coalition government with the
 Liberal Alliance of Free Democrats. Five parties, ranging from moderate to conserv-
 ative, constitute an active opposition in Parliament.
 There are no legal impediment to women's participation in government or the po-
 itical process; 43 of 386 pariamentary deputies are women. There are few women
 in leadership positions in the Government or the political parties. Several minorities
 are represented in Parliament, including one Rom, one ethnic German, one ethnic
 Slovak, and one ethnic Croat.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Numerous human rights organizations operate without government restriction or
 interference. Many NGO's report that the Government is generally responsive to
 their requests for information. However, individual police units are reportedly unco-
 operative at times, particularly in cases involving Rma. There is also a 20-member
 parliamentary Committee for Human, Minority, and Religious Rights.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution provides for individual rights, equality, and protection against
 discrimination, but in practice discrimination still exists, particularly against Roma.
 Women.-Spousal abuse is believed to be common, but the vast majority of such
 abuse is not reported, and victims who step forward often receive little help from
 authorities. While there are laws against rape, it is often unreported for cultural
 reasons. Police attitudes towards victims of sexual abuse are often reportedly un-
 sympathetic, particularly if the victim was acquainted with her aggressor. Rape
 within marriage is not recognized in the Penal Code. According to the government
 
 
 973
 statistics office, there were 406 reported rapes in 1995 and 2,862 reported cases of
 assaults on women; for the first 6 months of 1996, 189 rapes and 1,303 assaults
 were reported.
 Legally, women have the same rights as men, including identical inheritance and
 property rights. While there is no overt discrimination against women, the number
 of women in middle or upper managerial positions in business and government is
 low. Women are heavily represented in the judiciary and in the medical and teach-
 n professions. The law does not prohibit sexual harassment in the work place.
 1995 report prepared under the auspices of the United Nations to evaluate com-
 pliance with the Convention on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women
 termed sexual harassment in the workplace as "virtually epidemic." Women's groups
 report that a major problem is that women ame not awae of their rights. The Gov-
 ernment moved to address women's concerns by establishing an Office of Women's
 Issues in the Ministry of Labor.
 Chidren.-The Government is committed to children's rights. Education is man-
 datory through 16 years of age, and employment is illegal below the age of 16. There
 is no societal pattern of chld abuse. According to the government statistics office,
 there were 753 reported cases of violence against children in 1995, 100 of which
 took place within the family. For the first 6 months of 1996, 331 crimes against chil-
 dren were reported, of which 54 were within the home.
 PTple With Disabilities.-The Government does not mandate accessibility to
 buildings or government services for people with disabilities. Services for the dis-.
 abled are limited, and most buildings are not wheelchair accessible.
 Religious Minorities.-There were few anti-Semitic incidents (almost all graffiti)
 and no reports of attacks by skinhead or neo-Nazi sympathizers against the Jewish
 community. However, in October two smali bombs exploded in the Jewish quarter,
 one in the vicinity of the Dohany Street synagogue. In March tombstones in a Jew-
 ish emetery in Budapest were vandalized with swastikas. In September a court
 fined the Debrecen soccer club $2,000 (300,000 forints) after unruly football fans
 chanted anti-Semitic slogans against a rival team from Budapest.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-The 1993 law on ethnic and minority rights
 establishes the concept of collective rights of minorities and states that minorities
 need special rights in order to preserve their ethnic identities. It explicitly permits
 organized forms of limited self-government in areas where ethnic groups constitute
 a majority and states that the establishment of self-governing bodies must be made
 possible in localities where an ethnic group constitutes less than a majority of the
 population. The law permits associations, movements, and political parties based
 upon an ethnic or national character and mandates unrestricted use of ethnic lan-
 guages. Only those ethnic groups that have lived within the country's present bor-
 ders for at least 100 years and whose members are citizens may obtain recognized
 status under this law.
 On this basis, the law specifically grants minority status to 13 ethnic or national
 groups. Other groups may petition the Chairman of Parliament for inclusion if they
 comprise at least 1,000 citizens and have their own language and culture.
 In 1994 the first elections were held for minorty local self-government entities,
 which resulted in the formation of over 600 minority local bodies. The number grew
 in 1995 to 817 organizations, of which 477 are Roma groups. With funding from the
 central budget and logistical support from local governments, these bodies have as
 their primary respnsibility influencing and overseeing local matters affecting the
 minorities. In 1995 these groups elected national minority self-government bodies,
 whose effectiveness has varied widely. The non-Romani minorities appear to be the
 most satisfied, while Romani leaders express frustration with the self-governments'
 lack of clear authority, responsibility, or resources. These entities' greatest value is
 that they provide a platform for minorities to address local and national government
 organizations; their greatest weakness is that the Government is compelled to lis-
 ten, but not to act.
 In 1995 Parliament appointed an Ombudsman--currently an ethnic German-
 specifically charged with defending minority rights. The office, however, does not in-
 cdude any Roma, the largest minority group.
 Roma constitute at least 4 percent of the population; Germans, the second largest
 minority group, constitute about 2 percent. There are smaller communities of Slo-
 vaks, Croats, Romanians, Poles, Greeks, Serbs, Slovenes, Armenians, Ruthenians,
 and Bulgarians, which all are recognized as minorities.
 Education is available to varying degrees in almost all minority languages. There
 are minority-language print media, and the state-run radio broadcasts 2-hour daily
 programs in the mother tongue of major nationalities, i.e., Slovak, Romanian, Ger-
 man, Croatian, and Serbian. State-run television carries a 30-minute program for
 the larger minority groups, complemented by 5-minute weekly news bulletins.

 Conditions of life within the Romani community are significantly poorer than
 among the general population. Roma suffer from discrimination and racist attacks
 and are considerably less educated, with lower than avera incomes and life ex-
 pectancy. The Romani unemployment rate is estimated toe 70 percent, over six
 times the national average of 10.5 percent. With unemployment benefits exhausted
 and social services stretched thin, Roma often confront desperate situations. Roma
 constitute a majority of the prison population. The deplorable conditions within the
 Romani community were documented in July by the human rights NGO Helsinki
 Watch. The Helsinki Watch report states that Roma have suffered disproportion-
 ately in the post-Communist economic transition, particularly in terms of unemploy-
 ment and the degradation of their urban communities into slums. Helsinki Watch
 reports that Roma continue to suffer widespread discrimination in education, hous-
 ing, and access to public institutions, including restaurants and pubs. While com-
 mending government efforts to address minority issues, Helsinki Watch states that
 such efforts, for the Roma, have been largely ineffective to date.
 The Government sponsors programs both to preserve Romani languages and cul-
 tural heritage and to assist social and economic assimilation. Nonetheless, wide-
 spreadi popular prejudice continues. Police commonly abuse Roma (see Section 1..).
 The Martin Luther King Organization (MLKO), which documents assaults on non-
 whites recorded six such incidents in the first half of 1996, a higher rate of assaults
 than the total (seven) for 1995. MLKO sources commented that they believe many
 cases go unreported.
 Section 6. Workers Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The 1992 Labor Code recognizes the right of unions
 to organize and bargain collectively and permits trade union pluralism. Workers
 have the right to associate freely, choose representatives, publish journals, and
 openly promote members' interests and views. With the exception of military per-
 sonnel and the police, they also have the right to strike. Under a separate 1992 law,
 public servants may neotiat working conditions, but the final decision on increas-
 m salaries rests with Parliament.
 e largest labor union organization is the National Confederation of Hungarian
 Trade Unions, the successor to the former monolithic Communist union, with over
 800,000 members. The Democratic League of Independent Unions and the Federa-
 tion of Workers' Councils have approximately 250,000 and 150,000 members respec-
 tively.
 There are no restrictions on trade union contacts with international organizations
 and unions have developed a wide range of ties with European and international
 trade union bodies.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain CoUectively.-The Labor Code permits col-
 lective bargaining at the enterprise and industry level, although the practice is not
 widespread and is actively discouraged in the growing private sector. There is a
 willingness among labor organizations to coo rate with one another, and this is
 particularly evident in their relationship in forums such as the National Interest
 Reconciliation Council (ET), which provides a forum for tripartite consultation
 among representatives from management, employees, and the Government. The ET
 discusses issues such as wage hikes and the setting of the minimum wage, which
 is centrally negotiated within the ET in order to control inflation. Individual trade
 unions and management may negotiate higher levels at the plant level. The Min-
 istry of Labor is responsible for drafting labor-related legislation, while special labor
 courts enforce labor laws. The decisions of these courts may be appealed to the civil
 court system. Employera are prohibited from discriminating against unions and
 their organizers. The Ministry of Labor enforces this provision.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The law prohibits forced or com-
 pulsory labor, and the Ministry of Labor enforces this prohibition.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The National Labor Center en-
 forces the minimum age of 16 years, with exceptions for apprentice programs which
 may begin at the . e of 15. There does not appear to be any significant abuse of
 this statute. Education is compulsory through 16 years of age. Roma are far more
 likely than non-Roma to stop attending schooi before 16 years of age.
 e. Acceptable Conditions at Work.-The ET establishes the legal minimum wage,
 which is subsequently implemented by Ministry of Labor decree. The minimum
 wage, $95 (14,500 forints) per month, is insufficient to provide an adequate stand-
 ar[ of living for a worker and family. Many workers supplement their primary em-
 ployment with second jobs.
 The Labor Code specifies various conditions of employment, including termination
 procedures, severance pay, maternity leave, trade union consultation rights in some
 
 
 975
 
 management decisions, annual and sick leave entitlement, and labor conflict resolu-
 tion procedures. Under the code, the official workday is set at 8 hours; it may vary,
 however, depending upon the nature of the industry. A 24-hour rest period is re-
 quired during any 7-dyPenriod
 Labor courts and the  inisty of Labor enforce occupational safety standards set
 by the Government, but specific safety conditions are not generally up to inter-
 nationally accepted standards. Enforcement of occupational safety standards is not
 always effective in part due to the limited resources the Ministry of Labor is able
 to commit to enforcement. In theory, workers have the right to remove themselves
 from dangerous work situations without jeopardy to continued employment.
