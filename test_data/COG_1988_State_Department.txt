 CONGO
 The People's Republic of the Congo is officially a
 Marxist-Leninist state governed by an elite group of civilian
 and military officials through the single legal party, the
 Congolese Labor Party (PCT). Chief of State and Head of
 Government, President Denis Sassou-Nguesso, also serves as
 President of the PCT Central Committee. The President
 nominates the other 10 members of the PCT Political Bureau,
 the key policymaking group, whose selection is approved by the
 75-member Central Committee. Central Committee membership is
 balanced among southern, northern, and central ethnic groups.
 The military and security services are firmly under the
 control of the northerners, and they ultimately are the
 arbiters of power in the Congo. But the need to maintain a
 consensus among the competing regions and ethnic groups
 provides a check on arbitrary policies.
 The security apparatus, which is under the direction of the
 Presidency, is headed by the State Security Organization
 (DGSE) and is patterned after those in Eastern Europe. Its
 principal objective is to protect the State against possible
 dissident activity. PCT "core groups" are in all ministries,
 labor organizations, mass organizations, and urban districts
 to monitor the activities of workers and neighbors. The
 military forces are also used for internal security purposes.
 The Congolese economy is highly dependent on oil, which in
 1988 accounted for over 90 percent of exports. Sharp
 reductions in oil revenues forced the Government to cut its
 budget in half in 1985 and to accept an International Monetary
 Fund (IMF) adjustment program in 1986. In 1987 the World Bank
 approved two loans totaling $85.2 million for a structural
 adjustment program and a short-term advisory program to study
 reforms in public enterprises. The IMF program expired in
 April 1988; negotiations for a second accord were under way at
 the end of the year. Within the PCT leadership there has been
 much discussion about mismanagement of the economy.
 The human rights situation in the Congo changed little in
 1988. Most Congolese live their daily lives with little
 governmental and police interference so long as they refrain
 from opposing the Government or criticizing its goals. There
 was a coup attempt against the Government in July 1987 led by
 former army captain Pierre Anga and a few supporters with
 alleged ties to former President Joachim Yhombi-Opango. In
 August 1987, government forces engaged Anga and several others
 in battle in the northern town of Owando. Anga fled and
 remained at large until July 1988, when he was tracked down
 and killed by government troops. According to Amnesty
 International (AI), the Government arrested 60 or 70 people in
 the coup aftermath, including several of Anga's relatives,
 many of whom remained in preventive detention without charge
 in Brazzaville at the end of 1988. Also, Yhombi-Opango
 remained under house arrest in Brazzaville. Although the
 President announced in August the unconditional release of all
 political detainees and convicted prisoners except those
 arrested in connection with the 1987 coup plot, at the end of
 19a8 a number of political.detainees and convicts apparently
 remained in prison.

 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There were no reported politically motivated killings.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reported cases of disappearance for political
 motives.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 The practice of beating suspects at police stations and at
 state security centers in the course of interrogations is
 common. The public or the police frequently beat thieves who
 have been caught in the act of stealing. Political detainees
 are held incommunicado, and it is reasonable to assume that
 police use torture to extract desired information that is not
 freely given. Several political prisoners held incommunicado
 in the past are now leading normal lives with no apparent ill
 effect. Some have regained earlier status and others are
 serving as government ministers.
 Prison conditions in general are poor, and there is a lack of
 adequate food, hygiene, and medical care. Both detainees and
 prisoners may be visited by family or friends, who bear all
 responsibility for providing food and medicines.
 AI in various statements and reports, expressed concern over
 reports of torture of some of those detained after the 1987
 coup attempt, including Lt. Colonel Eboundit, Georges
 Mafouta-Kitoko, and Eugene Madimba. The Government denied
 that Eboundit had been tortured or was in ill health. Eugene
 Madimba was resettled in France in 1988 with the assistance of
 the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR).
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The Constitution provides protection against arbitrary
 indictment, arrest, and detention. But, in practice, a
 warrant is not required to make arrests. There is a legal
 requirement that a detainee be brought before an investigative
 judge within 3 days of arrest. The judge may then order
 detention for a maximum period of 6 months, kfter which the
 detainee must be charged or released. This law does not apply
 in cases involving the security of the State, and political
 detainees have been held for lengthy periods without being
 brought before a judge or charged. The trial of those accused
 of having participated in the 1982 bombings in Brazzaville did
 not take place until 1986, and some of the accused were held
 incommunicado for several years.
 Despite the Government's steps to increase the number of
 magistrates and to improve procedures, the administrative
 processing of regular criminal cases is slow, and persons
 awaiting trial often are held for lengthy periods. Detained
 persons are entitled to legal counsel. All lawyers are
 regulated by the State. In capital criminal cases, defense
 lawyers are provided by the Government for those without
 funds. Whether a detainee is formally charged usually depends
 upon the seriousness of the crime and the economic situation
 of the family. For lesser crimes, the person is usually taken
 
 
 82
 CONGO
 to jail, where he may be beaten and held for a few days, then
 released on bail pending a trial which may or may not ever
 take place. A person accused of a serious crime (e.g.,
 murder, rape) is held in prison until the trial, which may be
 held months or even years later.
 The number of political detainees or prisoners in 1988 was
 unknown. Initially the Government reportedly arrested some 60
 or 70 persons in connection with the 1987 coup attempt. The
 Government officially acknowledged the arrest of four military
 men and two civilians for alleged participation in the 1987
 coup plot. Ex-President Yhombi-Opango and Colonel Jean Michel
 Ebaka and Lt. Colonel Eboundit, the ranking military officers
 arrested, remained in detention at a government housing
 complex at year's end. After the killing of coup leader
 Pierre Anga in July, a number of his relatives and other
 associates were arrested, including his widow, a daughter, and
 two brothers. The Government claimed to have released some of
 these persons by the end of 1988 but refused to reveal the
 names of those still in detention or those released.
 In August the President announced an amnesty for most persons
 held for political offenses since 1963, except those arrested
 in connection with the 1987 coup plot. Despite this
 announcement, it appeared that at least some political
 detainees who were not connected to the 1987 coup plot
 remained in prison at the end of the year, including Georges
 Mafouta-Kitoko, Christophe Samba, and Florent Kihoulou, all of
 whom, according to AI, have been held without charge since
 1986 for belonging to an independent political discussion
 group and writing a tract calling for a "new society." The
 Government asserts they were involved in a coup attempt.
 There were no known instances of exile being used as a means
 of political control in 1988. With regard to forced or
 compulsory labor, see Section 6.c.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The legal system is not insulated from political interference.
 The Constitution provides for a Supreme Court, which is in
 practice an arm of the executive branch rather than an
 independent body. The amended Constitution also provides for
 nonprofessional jndges to be elected to all courts below the
 Supreme Court. The stated purpose of this change was to
 popularize justice," i.e., provide a role for peers to
 influence the formal judicial process. According to the law,
 any Congolese citizen may become a judge but can adjudicate
 cases only in collaboration with trained judges. Each
 nomination must be approved by the party. By law, the right
 to a fair and public trial exists in all cases, and the
 judicial process is relatively fair and open for those accused
 of common crimes. Also, it is not unusual to have a higher
 court reverse lower court decisions in nonpolitical cases.
 Political cases are tried by a special court, the
 Revolutionary Court of Justice. In February 1987, AI
 submitted a 27-page report expressing its concern that the
 August 1986 trial of 10 persons, who were convicted of causing
 bomb explosions in Brazzaville in March and July 1982, had not
 met international standards of fairness for several reasons,
 e.g., several judges were members of the PCT Central Committee
 and had been involved in the case at an earlier stage.
 
 
 83
 CONGO
 Prior to his state visit to France in 1987, President
 Sassou-Nguesso granted a pardon to a French national, Claude
 Buisson, who had been sentenced to 7 years' hard labor in the
 August 1986 bombing trial. In August 1988, the President
 commuted the sentences of four other defendants convicted in
 the 1986 bomb plot trial, including Claude Ernest Ndala, a
 former Congolese official, whose sentence was reduced from
 death to hard labor for life. Three others had 20-year
 sentences reduced to 5 years.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 There is generally little interference by the Government with
 privacy, family, home, or correspondence so long as a person
 does not engage in any activity which involves or implies
 opposition to the Government.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Freedom of speech and press are restricted, despite guarantees
 in the Constitution. The Government allows some criticism of
 its policies and programs judged not to be politically
 sensitive, but it does not allow its ultimate authority to be
 challenged publicly. The Government does not hesitate to
 arrest people and hold them incommunicado for expressing views
 it finds objectionable, as in the cases of Georges
 Mafouta-Kitoko and two others who were arrested in April 1986,
 and Jean-Felix Demba Ntelo, who was released by presidential
 decree in 1988 after several months in custody. The Government
 maintains these persons were involved in a coup. attempt.
 The State owns and controls all media except for one weekly
 religious newspaper. A state censorship committee reviews the
 content of all newspapers, movies, books, and records.
 Articles considered to be critical of the Government or its
 leaders are censored. The Government and party, through
 general guidelines for journalists, control the kinds of news
 Congolese journalists may publish from various sources of
 information. Television viewers have access to Zairian radio
 and television, as well as to news and feature programming
 from France and the United States. While the Government
 controls the local press, foreign journalists are generally
 permitted to travel freely once an entry visa and a special
 permit for travel to the interior are obtained. These are
 usually granted.
 Academic freedom is limited. The Congolese educational system
 borrows liberally from the Soviet system in form, but it
 offers a broad range of materials, including American, to
 students.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The right of peaceful assembly is limited by the State's
 perceived self-interest. Political meetings are permitted
 only for the party and its affiliated organizations.
 Government permission is not required for groups to assemble
 for religious and social purposes, but it is required for the
 use of official facilities. Government authorization also is
 required to establish professional clubs and organizations, of
 which there are several.
 
 
 84
 CONGO
 For a discussion of freedom of association as it applies to
 labor unions, see Section 6.a.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Freedom of religion is guaranteed by law, but the Government
 is officially atheist. Christmas Day, for example, is
 officially called Children's Day.  Religious organizations,
 such as the Salvation Army, must obtain the Government's
 permission to work in the Congo. Jehovah's Witnesses are not
 permitted in the Congo. Members of the Baha'i faith may hold
 services but are prohibited from organizing and teaching.
 With these exceptions, the party and Government do not
 interfere in religious affairs. The Catholic Church, the
 largest.single religious community, maintains a seminary for
 the training of its clergy and has missions throughout the
 country. Masses are held in the various local languages as
 well as in French. The Catholic church publishes the only
 independent newspaper, La Semaine Africaine. Catholic and
 other missionaries are active in managing private missions and
 clinics and providing other social services. While some of
 these services are joint ventures between the Church and the
 Government, many of the services formerly provided by churches
 have lapsed.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 The Government exercises limited control over the internal
 movement of its citizens through identification card checks.
 There are control points outside all major towns manned by
 soldiers or militia, who rigorously check identification
 documents. Congolese citizens who wish to travel abroad
 require exit authorization from the State Security
 Organization (DGSE). Government employees traveling abroad
 must obtain permission from the appropriate government
 office. Passports must be returned to the DSGE after the
 traveler's return from abroad. The Government exercises tight
 control over travel by foreigners in the Congo. Most visas
 are for one entry only; exit visas are required for
 nondiplomats; and those desiring to travel into the interior
 must obtain permission from the appropriate ministry. There
 are no known instances of Congolese being refused the right to
 return to their country. Citizenship may be lost under
 conditions established in the nationality code, e.g., by
 taking the citizenship of another country or after conviction
 for espionage. There are no known cases of a native-born
 Congolese being denied citizenship.
 The Congo is the home of about 2,100 exiles and refugees,
 primarily from Chad, Central African Republic, and Zaire.
 While refugees are subject to surveillance and occasional
 harassment by the Congolese Government, there were no cases of
 forcible repatriation in 1988. The Congo is a party to the
 U.N. Convention and Protocol Relating to the Status of
 Refugees, and a representative of the UNHCR is resident in
 Brazzaville.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: the Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 The Congolese people do not have the right to change their
 government through democratic processes. While the President
 is the most powerful single person in the Government, his
 authority is limited by his need to maintain a consensus in
 
 
 CONGO
 the Political Bureau and within the larger Central Committee
 of the PCT, which is carefully balanced among northerners,
 southerners, and those from the central region. Military
 officers occupy key positions among the ruling group and help
 ensure its continuation in power.
 Opportunities for political involvement by Congolese citizens
 are limited to the Marxist-Leninist Congolese Labor Party
 (PCT), including its mass organizations, and to participation
 in the national, regional, and local assemblies. The
 Congolese Labor Party is the "supreme social and political
 organization." No other political parties are permitted to
 operate. PCT membership numbers only 8,700 out of a total
 population of almost.2 million. Membership is awarded on the
 basis of political loyalty and public service.
 The powers of the National Assembly are limited. The
 national, regional, and local assemblies are elected by
 universal suffrage from single-party approved lists, which
 contain only one candidate for each seat. The selection
 process can involve a certain amount of negotiation within the
 PCT. Incumbents have been turned out of office in the
 process. National Assembly representatives are chosen on a
 merit basis from a broad spectrum of the population, including
 party members, the army, small farmers, and workers. The
 National Assembly has some impact on social and economic
 issues, and regional and local assemblies may discuss issues
 and make recommendations before decisions are made at the
 national level. The last elections for the national,
 regional, and local assemblies occurred in 1984.
 Women play a small but increasingly visible role in the
 nation's political life. Only 600 out of the party's 8,700
 members are women. Four women are members of the party's
 75-member Central Committee, and several are seated in the
 National Assembly. The highest r~nking woman in the Congo,
 Celine Eckombo, is the PCT political commissioner of the
 nation's third city, Loubomo.
 Section A Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government permitted AI to send an observer to the 1986
 bombing trial. However, the Government did not respond to
 AI's subsequent request to send a delegation to review the
 human rights situation or to its 1987 memorandum concerning
 the 1986 trial. There are no human rights organizations in
 the Congo.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Under the Constitution there is no official discrimination
 based on race, sex, religion, language, or social status. As
 previously noted, northerners exert strong influence in
 politics and in the security services.
 Women have the same legal rights as men in the commercial,
 political, and social domains. There is a large disparity,
 however, between salaries for men and women, and women are
 relegated to a secondary role in the modern sectors of
 society, as well as in rural society where women are heavily
 involved in traditional family farming. Among some ethnic
 groups women are often the chief decisionmakers.
 
 
 86
 CONGO
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 The labor code adopted in March 1975 is quite liberal in
 theory and provides for the right of workers to associate. In
 practice, given its past active political role, the labor
 movement is scrutinized closely and controlled by the
 Government and party, largely through the umbrella union, the
 Congolese Trade Union Confederation (CTUC), which is an
 appendage of the party. The party approves the national
 leadership of the CTUC. No group is allowed to form an
 independent, alternative union outside the party. As long as
 political subjects are avoided, there is a certain degree of
 democratic dialog within the labor movement and between the
 CTUC and the Government.
 The CTUC unions are prohibited from striking, although wildcat
 strikes do occur with relative impunity.
 The CTUC is affiliated with the World Federation of Trade
 Unions, but it is free to associate with other international
 and regional labor bodies. For example, as a reflection of
 the Congolese Government's efforts to improve contacts with
 Western countries, the CTUC leadership proposed establishment
 of a bilateral relationship with the African-American Labor
 Center in July 1988.
 Despite government assertions that the single trade union
 system results from the common will of the workers and from
 political, economic, and historical development, the
 International Labor Organization (ILO) Committee of Experts
 has noted that a trade union monopoly established by
 legislation is in violation of ILO Convention 87 and has urged
 the Government to brings its legislation into conformity.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 The CTUC is represented in every ministry and state-owned
 enterprise and serves on mandatory boards along with a member
 of the Government and the party. Known as the "determinant
 trilogy," this structure is responsible for ensuring that the
 three major points of view are represented in the
 decisionmaking process and serves as the Congo's form of
 collective bargaining. While no alternatives exist to
 striking, the local unions within the Confederation have been
 able in some instances to persuade the Government to provide
 workers with increased benefits. The entire Congolese labor
 force is treated equally under the law; there are no
 exceptions such as those granted, for example, to export
 processing zones, of which the Congo has none.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 There were no substantiated reports of forced or compulsory
 labor, which is legally prohibited.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 The minimum age for the employment of children is 16. Outside
 the Government and major employers, this minimum is often
 ignored, especially in small family enterprises or family
 farms in the subsistence agricultural sector.
 
 
 87
 CONGO
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 In previous years, revenues from oil production allowed the
 Government to employ large numbers of Congolese in various
 government organizations, including state corporations. Owing
 to declining oil .revenues and the need to comply with an IMF
 standby agreement and World Bank structural adjustment
 programs, the' Government has abandoned its program
 ofguaranteed employment for all university graduates. It is
 privatizing some state enterprises and has frozeh government
 hiring. Working conditions for Congolese in the modern
 sector, which employs about 50 percent of the population, are
 generally good. These include a maximum 40-hour workweek, at
 least 1 day of rest per week, family benefits, severance pay,
 and medical care. There is a social security system, and the
 minimum monthly wage is $102 for urban employees. Domestic
 workers must be paid at least $75 monthly. These wages are
 sufficient to provide for a decent standard of living.
 Outside government and the large corporations, these minimums
 are often ignored. There is a code of occupational safety and
 health, although it too is probably not rigidly enforced.
 While many salaried Congolese have a generally high standard
 of working conditions and social benefits, most of the rural
 population is still engaged in subsistence farming.
