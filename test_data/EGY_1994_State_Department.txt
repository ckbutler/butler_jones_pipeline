 EGYPT
 According to its Constitution, Egypt is a social democracy in which Islam is the
 state religion. The President is Hosni Mubarak, who was reelected unopposed to a
 third 6-year term by the People's Assembly in 1993. The President appoints the
 Cabinet which is responsible to him. His party, the National Democratic Party
 (NDP), has governed since its establishment in 1978. It commands large majorities
 in the popularly elected People's Assembly and the Shura (Consultative) Council.
 One opposition party is represented in the People's Assembly; the others boycotted
 the previous People's Assembly election in 1990 and are not represented.
 There are several security services in the Ministry of Interior two of which are
 primarily involved in combating extremist violence: the State Security Investiga-
 tions Sector (SSIS), which conducts investigations and interrogates detainees; and
 the Central Security Force (CSF), which enforces curfews, bans on public dem-
 onstrations, and conducts paramilitary operations against terrorists.
 Egypt is a developing country with a mixed economy dominated by the public sec-
 tor. Agriculture, an almost entirely private sector, remains the largest single em-
 ployer. Remittances from approximately 2 million Egyptians working in the Gulf
 countries are the largest source of foreign currency earnings. In the past 4 years,
 the Government has enacted significant economic reforms, which have reduced the
 budget deficit and stabilized the exchange rate, but has made slow progress on other
 reforms, including privatization.
 The Constitution provides for various human rights, including a multiparty politi-
 cal system, regular elections, the rule of law, an independent judiciary, freedom of
 opinion, and the right to peaceable private assembly. However, the Emergency Law
 continues to restrict many basic rights.
 There continued to be widespread human rights violations in 1994. The security
 services and terrorist groups remained locked in a cycle of violence. Security forces
 committed human rights abuses in their campaign against terrorist groups, but fre-
 quently victimized noncombatants as well. Under the Emergency Law, abuses in-
 cluded the widespread torture of detainees in security cases, the Government's con-
 tinued failure to punish those responsible for torture, arbitrary arrest, and detention
 without trial, and the use of military courts to try suspected terrorists. The Govern-
 ment continued to arrest and harass journalists and lawyers who defended accused
 Islamists. Terrorists bombed banks, attacked and killed government officials, secu-
 rity forces, Egyptian Christians, and foreign tourists, and were responsible for the
 majority of civilian deaths in 1994.
 The ruling NDP dominates the political scene to such an extent that, as a prac-
 tical matter the citizens do not have a meaningful ability to change their govern-
 ment. The Government continues to restrict substantially basic rights of expression
 and the press. Women and Egyptian Christians face discrimination based on tradi-
 tion and some aspects of the law.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-In 1994 the state security police
 were implicated in several extrajudicial killings. In virtually all cases, the Govern-
 ment has not adequately investigated or explained the causes of death. On February
 1, police raided a house in Cairo, killing 7 suspected terrorists. The police maintain
 that a 3-hour shootout began when one of the suspects inside the house opened fire
 on the approaching police. However, witnesses later told the Egyptian Organization
 for Human Rights (EOHR) that the shootout lasted a matter of seconds, followed
 by a pause, and a later burst of gnnfire after the police had entered the house. One
 policeman was wounded in the incident. The mother of one of those killed filed a
 complaint against the police, alleging that security forces had executed her son. She
 retracted her complaint after the police detained her for 12 hours.
 On February 14, security forces shot dead three alleged extremists in a Cairo
 neighborhood. According to the Ministry of Interior, the police acted in self-defense
 after the suspects opened fire on a patrol in an alley. However, witnesses claimed
 
 
 1064
 that they observed the police arrest four suspects, place three of them into a police
 truck, and later heard suspected gunfire from witin the truck. Witnesses further
 claimed that they observed security officers dump three bodies from the trck onto
 the street and p ace guns and ammunition purportedly belonging to the dead sus-
 pects near the bodies. Local human rights monitors who inspected the scene con-
 cluded that the traces of blood on the street were too small to be consistent with
 the Government's claim that the suspects were shot on the spot in an exchange of
 fire. No information is available concerning the fourth detainee.
 On April 26, officials of the state security police arrested Islamist lawyer Abdel
 Hareth Madani at his office in Cairo. Madan died in police custody at a hospital
 eariy on April 27. The state security police did not inform Madani's family until
 May 6. The police did not allow Madai's family to view the body, which was trans-
 ported in a sealed offin to his village for burial. The Government initially claimed
 that Madani had died of an asthma attack, despite claims by morgue workers that
 they observed puncture wounds and bruises on Madani's body while preparing it for
 burial. In May the Mimistry of Justie announed that it would conduct an inves-
 tigation of Madani's death. At year's end, the results of the ongoing investigation
 had not been made public. The Minister of Interior has nonetheless publicly denied
 any police wrongdoing in Madani's death, maintaining that Madani died of natural
 causes.
 Also in April, local human rights monitors claim that Mohammed Abdel Hamid
 Hassan died in Abu Zabaal prison near Cairo, following beatings by a prison officer.
 Hassan was serving a 3-year sentence for sale of drugs; his body was allegedly
 thrown from a fourth-floor window to conceal the cause of death. The Prosecutor
 General's office investigated the case and charged the officer with Hassan's death.
 The officer was released on bail, pending further investigation.
 In August Fateh al-Bab Abdel Manem died at a  lice station in the Cairo suburb
 of Helwan, following his arrest on drug charges. He was detained along with his
 wife and son. According to human rights monitors, Abdel Manem died after 12 con-
 tinuous hours of torture, witnessed by his son. The autopsy report indicates cause
 of death as cerebral hemorrhage and "major wounds to the body." The Prosecutor
 General's office has stated it will investigate the death but at year's end had not
 made public its findings.
 In 1993 at least 12 persons died from injuries sustained while in police custody,
 and 2 others died amid charges of inadequate medical treatment. The Government
 reported that it had referred security officials for prosecution in the cases of the
 death of Sayyed Hassan Fetouh and Hassan Salah Sayyed. At year's end, the offi-
 cers had not been brought to trial. The Government continued investigations of pos-
 sible criminal conduct in the 1993 deaths in police custody of Effat Mohammed Ali
 Wali, al-Muhamdi Mohammed Mohammed Mursi, Mohammed Gomma Abdel
 Sayyed, Eissa Taher Soliman, and Arnre Mohammed Safwat.
 The Government closed the cases of Ahmed Farouk Ahmed Ali, Abdel Sattar
 Abdalrah Rashwan, Mohammed Abdel Hamid, and Mohammed Ateya Shamardan,
 ruling that in the cases of Ali, Hamid, and Shamardan, death occurred as the result
 of preexisting medical disorders. The death of Rashwan was ruled accidental electro-
 cution. The Government claimed it had no records of the arrests of Beahaa el-Din
 Abdel Raouf Mohammed, Mohammed Hossain Mohammed, or Ahman Abdel
 Rahman Mohammed, whose relatives claim they were last seen in police custody.
 The Government's report on these cases left unanswered several questions raised
 by the relatives of the deceased persons and human rights groups. The Government
 stated that it will try to resolve the inconsistencies and provide further information.
 The press reported that at least 286 people were killed in civil unrest in 1994
 compared with 201 in 1993. In antiextremist operations, security forces killed at
 least 139 suspected extremists, 5 civilian bystanders and a fellow policeman by
 friendly fire. The security forces appear to have caused some of these deaths by the
 excessive use of lethal force.
 In April security forces in Assiyut opened fire on a taxi stopped at a police road-
 block, killing the driver and three passengers, including a woman. The police main-
 tained that one of the passengers tried to kill an officer at the roadblock. However,
 local human rights monitors believe that the shooting broke out when a policeman's
 weapon accidentally misfired, provoking others to open fire on the car.
 In October security forces used lethal force in quelling a demonstration in support
 of a strike by textile workers (see Section 6.a.).
 Terrorists killed at least 101 members of the security forces and 40 civilians, in-
 cluding a witness in the trial of persons indicted for the November 1993 assassina-
 tion attempt on Prime Minister Atef Sedky. In four incidents, extremists attacked
 foreign tourist groups, killing five tourists and several Egyptian bystanders.
 
 
 1065
 In October a suspected terrorist stabbed Naguib Mahfouz, an Egyptian novelist,
 Nobel laureate, and antifundamentalist critic, in the neck with aknife. Mahfouz
 survived. As they have in recent years, Islamic extremists targeted Egyptian Chris-
 tians, attacking churches and other properties owned by Copts, and are believed to
 have murdered at least nine Copts (see Section 5).
 Extremist groups took responsibility for the following murders of senior govern-
 ment and police officials: police Brigadier General Raouf Khairat in Cairo on Feb-
 ruary 10, and the Director of Central Security Forces in Assiyut, General Sherine
 Ali F    i, on February 20.
 b. Disappearance.-Mansur Kikhya, a former Libyan Foreign Minister under
 Colonel Qadhafi and a prominent exiled dissident, disappeared from Cairo in De-
 cember 1993. The Government has been unable to account for Kikhya's disappear-
 ance. Some observers, citin Libya's long history of antidissident campaigns, believe
 that Libyan operatives abducted Kikhya. Kikhya's whereabouts are still unknown.
 In December local human rights monitors published a report on disappearances,
 which claims that 11 people disappeared in 1994 after their arrests. It recounts the
 unsuccessful efforts by family members and nongovernmental organizations to lo-
 cate them in the detention system According to the report, the number of dis-
 appearances in 1994 was "unprecedented," compared to three disappearances in
 1991 and three in 1993. At year's end, the Government had not yet responded to
 the report.
 c. Torture and Other Crue, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 There is convincing evidence that the police and officers of the SSIS systematically
 practice torture. The law does not adequately protect citizens from physical abuse
 by security forces. Article 126 of the Penal Code prohibits torture to obtain a confes-
 sion but is silent on the mistreatment of detainees for other reasons. Punishment
 for offenders is imprisonment for a maximum of 10 years. A 1-year sentence and
 a modest fine may be imposed if the injury does not reach the level of bleeding or
 wounding. However, Article 126 does not address such abuses as blindfolding and
 prolonged interrogation and handcuffing.
 The Minister of Interior stated several times in 1994 that torture does not exist
 in detention facilities. Instances may occur, he said, but they are isolated and not
 official government policy. The Minister also stated that the authorities investigate
 all allegations and punish those responsible. Government officials have accused
 human rights organizations of focusing on the rights of accused terrorists, while ig-
 noring those of the victims of extremist attacks. Officials argued that international
 human rights groups exaggerate torture reports and that their reporting does not
 take into account the extreme nature of the security threat. However, the record in-
 dicates that the Government does not adequately investigate torture complaints in
 cases involving suspected terrorists. Since 1985, there is no evidence that officers
 implicated in such cases have been prosecuted or punished.
 While the Government has investigated torture complaints in criminal cases and
 punished some offending officers, the punishments do not necessarily relate to the
 seriousness of the injury. In August the press reported that a senior SSIS officer
 received 6 months' imprisonment for permanently crippling a suspect during inter-
 ro ation.
 )fficers of the SSIS allegedly are responsible for most of the torture used on sus-
 pected terrorist detainees. Prisoners report that torture takes place in police sta-
 tions, SSIS headquarters in Cairo, and the governorates, and at Central Security
 Force camps. Torture is used to extract information, coerce the victims to end their
 antigovernment activities, and deter others from such activities. Torture victims are
 usually taken to a state security office where they are handcuffed, blindfolded, and
 questioned about their associations, religious beliefs, and political views. Victims
 have reported the following torture methods: detainees are frequently stripped to
 their underwear;, hung by their wrists with their feet touching the floor or forced
 to stand for prolonged periods; doused with hot and cold water, beaten; forced to
 stand outdoors in cold weather, and subjected to electric shocks. Some victims, in-
 cluding female detainees, report they have been raped or threatened with rape; oth-
 ers report that security officers have inserted solid objects, including electric devices,
 into their anuses.
 Written records of detainees' whereabouts are not kept while they are in the cus-
 tody of the state security police, a period which may last 10 days or longer. Records
 are maintained only after security forces deliver the detainee to a prison. The ab-
 sence of such a record in the early days of detention invites abuse and effectively
 blocks the investigation of torture complaints. The security forces also transfer de-
 tainees from prisons to other facilities where they are interrogated, tortured, and
 then returned to prison. No written records are kept on such transfers.
 
 
 1066
 To pressure male fugitives to surrender, security forces have taken into custody
 their relatives, including minors and female family members. An undetermined
 number of such detainees have been subjected tophysical abuse.
 According to government sources, the prisons have a 400-percent occupancy rate,
 resulting in unhealthy living conditions, severe overcrowding, and occasional out-
 breaks of disease. Many of the country's 31 prisons were constructed during the
 Ottoman era. Prisoners report cells are poorly ventilated, and food is inadequate in
 quantity and nutritional value.
 Prison officials occasionally levy collective punishment on inmates, suspending
 visits and delivery of food to inmates by their families. According to official prison
 sources, in Qanater women's prison, the prison doctor was prosecuted for sexually
 molesting 12 female prisoners during examinations. Prisoners reported that prison
 guards beat a number of women in the aftermath of the scandal, and a sweep of
 theprison facilities resulted in the confiscation and destruction of many prisoners'
 clothes and personal belongings.
 As many as 28 adolescents between the ages of 12 and 17 have reportedly been
 detained in the Assiyut General Prison, a facility for adults. The charges against
 the adolescents reportedly include membership in the illegal Islamic Group, mon-
 itoring the movements of the police, and attempting to break into a mosque. The
 adolescents allege that they were blindfolded and tortured at the state security po-
 lice headquarters in Assiyut or at local police stations in southern Egypt. Torture
 methods reportedly included suspension, electric shocks, and beatings with sticks.
 In some cases, electricity was reportedly applied to the penis and tongue. Some of
 the adolescents have been detained for prolonged periods without trial, in one case
 since 1993.
 Prison officials impose particularly harsh living conditions on some categories of
 prisoners such as Islamic activists. Al-Aqrab prison, which houses security suspects,
 has been closed to all visitors, including awyers, since January, despite an adminis-
 trative court order in April annulling the Ministry of Interior's ban.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Arbitrary arrest and detention are com-
 monly used against suspected terrorists and others suspected of threatening na-
 tional security. However, according to local human rights groups, in some mass se-
 curity operations, security forces have subjected entire villages to collective punish-
 ments, such as curfews and mass arrests. Frequently, the police have taken into
 custody nonviolent Islamists and persons with no association with extremist groups.
 Such arrests and detentions are conducted under the State of Emergency which has
 been in effect since President Sadat's assassination in 1981.
 In April the People's Assembly renewed the Emergency Law until May 31, 1997.
 Government supporters claim that the Emergency Law is a temporary measure
 used only to fight terrorism or drug trafficking. However, the Emergency Law has
 been in force so long that it has become an important characteristic of the political
 and legal system and is an impediment to the improvement of the human rights
 situation. Under the Emergency Law, there is a continuous flow of new arrests and
 releases from detention. Mass arrests continued in 1994, despite the Minister of In-
 terior's stated intention in 1993 to deemphasize these arrests.
 Under the Emergency Law, the Interior Minister may detain an individual with-
 out indictment for 90 days. Detention orders are issued by public prosecutors who
 have limited powers to commit individuals to confinement. Some detainees are not
 allowed to inform their relatives of their detention, and access to legal counsel is
 frequently delayed. In theory, those arrested under the Emergency Law should be
 released after 90 days. In practice, the Government rearrests detainees who have
 been released by court order. The procedure in effect detains them without due proc-
 ess for prolonged periods.
 Under the Penal Code, arrested persons are charged with violations of specific
 laws, have the right to a judicial determination of the legality of arrest, and should
 be formally charged within 48 hours of arrest or be released. Arrests under this pro-
 cedure occur openly and with warrants issued by a district prosecutor or a judge.
 There is a system of bail. The Penal Code also gives the State wide detention pow-
 ers. State prosecutors may obtain court orders to detain individuals for 45 days and
 to confine them for up to 6 months to complete investigations. Detainees are often
 released without explanation or acknowledgment that charges have been dropped.
 The Penal Code contains several provisions to combat extremist violence. These
 provisions broadly define terrorism to include the acts of "spreading panic and "ob-
 structing the work of authorities," allow the police to hold suspects for 24 hours be-
 fore obtaining arrest warrants, and prescribe the death penalty for persons found
 guilty of terrorism and life imprisonment for membership in a terrorist group.
 Human rights observers report that the security forces maintain an unauthorized
 permanent presence in prisons. This practice purportedly violates Article 40 of the
 
 
 1067
 Criminal Procedures Code which prohibits contact between intelligence officers and
 prisoners. SSIS officers reportedly frequently remove prisoners from their cells and
 take them to other locations for questioning.
 Official sources estimate the total prison population at 14,000, of which 5,000 are
 security cases. They note that approximately 4,000 detainees are held without
 charge. These numbers do not inchido the undetermined number of persons who are
 in detention prior to their entrance in the prison system (see Section 1.c.).
 In May the Government detained 41 lawyers following a demonstration at the Bar
 Association building in Cairo by lawyers protesting the death in police custody of
 Abdel Hareth Madani (see Section 1.b.). Some of the detained lawyers were charged
 with demonstrating illegally and threatening public order, while others, acting as
 their defense attorneys, were accused of incitement. Some were detained without
 charge. None was tried. All but one, Montasser Al-Zayyat, were released after 3 to
 4 weeks in detention. AI-Zayyat is the self-declared spokesman for the Islamic
 Group, as well as a well-known attorney who has defended accused extremists, in-
 cluding Sheikh Omar Abdul Rahman. State prosecutors ordered his release from de-
 tention on December 6; he still faces possible trial on charges of his association with
 an illegal terrorist organization and contact with terrorists.
 In other cases, security forces continue to detain at least 150 former defendants
 who have been acquitted in court. Some have been held for as long as 3 or 4 years.
 In September the plice reportedly arrested hundreds of people to prevent any
 disruption of the U. International Conference on Population and Development,
 which was held in Cairo. The police targeted extremists who were reportedly plan-
 ning to attack the conference.
 In October thepolice arrested hundreds of persons in Cairo and Hurghada in a
 security sweep. The arrests followed the September 27 killing at a Red Sea resort
 town of a German tourist and two Egyptian citizens by suspected terrorists.
 Human rights observers estimate hat 20 Palestinians are in detention. In Sep-
 tember the Government released 34 Palestinians at the request of a Palestinian
 human rights group and expelled them to Gaza. Some Palestinians who are still in
 detention entered Egyt illegally, while others are legal residents and are under in-
 vestigation for allegedo political activities. Some Palestinian detainees have report-
 edly been tortured. One Palestinian was executed in 1994 after conviction for in-
 volvement in terrorist offenses.
 e. Denial of Fair Public 2ral.-Although the judiciary in recent years has exer-
 cised considerable independence, the Government continued to circumvent the regu-
 lar court system by trying accused terrorists in military courts, in which they do
 not receive fair trials.
 There are three levels of civilian criminal courts: primary courts, appeals courts,
 and the Court of Cassation, the final stage of criminal appeal. There is also a Su-
 preme Constitutional Court, but its jurisdiction is limited to constitutional chal-
 lenges. It does not hear criminal appeals. The judicial system is based on the Napo-
 leonic tradition, hence there are no juries. Criminal cases are heard by panels of
 threeudges. Most trials are public.
 te civilian court system, the President appoints all judges based on nomina-
 tions from the Higher Judicial Council, a constitutional body designed to eisure the
 independence of the judiciary. The Council is composed of senior udges, lawyers,
 and law professors and is chaired by the President of the Court of Cassation. It reg-
 ulates judicial promotions salaries, transfers, and disciplinary actions. In practice,
 however, the Minister of Justice, an executive branch officer, has considerable influ-
 ence over judicial appointments and transfers. Judges may be appointed as prosecu-
 tors, and vice versa.
 There are three special courts for crimes considered to touch upon national secu-
 rity: state securit courts, courts of ethics, and military courts. The state security
 courts have jurisdiction over serious offenses, such as armed insurrection. They are
 divided into upper and lower divisions. Trials are heard by three judges, but two
 military officers may be added by presidential decree to the upper division. Defend-
 ants before a state security court may be indicted under the Penal Code or the
 Emergency Law. When an indictment is handed down under the Emergency Law,
 the court is designated an Emergency State Security Court.
 A defendant   as no    dicial appeal from an Emerenc     State Security Court.
 However, he may file an appeal for clemency from the President, or the Prime Min-
 ister acting for the President, who is empowered to amend, commute, or cancel a
 sentence, or order a retrial. These powers imply that an acquittal may be canceled
 and the defendant retried for the same offense.
 The Court of Ethics hears cases prosecuted under Law 95 of 1980 which makes
 illegal such activities as "endangerg the public safety,3 inciting youth to depart
 from religious values and loyalty to the faterland, and denying the three "heav-
 
 
 1068
 enly religions." It has an upper and lower division. In recent years, the ethics courts
 have been used relatively infrequently to try 'economic crimes," such as corruption
 and drug trafficking. An ethics court conviction denies the defendant the right to
 engage in certain occupations or activities. A person may be tried in a state security
 court and an ethics court on similar indictments: in the former for criminal offenses
 and in the latter for the financial gains associated with those offenses. Ethics courts
 have confiscated financial gains obtained under indictable offenses and may add
 prison terms to those meted out by state security courts. If the ethics and state se-
 curity courts reach different verdicts, the defendant may appeal to the President for
 a pardon.
 As part of their independence from the Government, judges have ordered inquests
 into torture cases; acuitted defendants in cases in which confessions were extracted
 by torture; challenged the ban on workers' strikes; defended the right to nonviolent
 ideological opinion; overturned bans on prohibited political parties; and overturned
 an election law that discriminated against independent candidates and ordered dis-
 solved the People's Assembly elected thereunder.
 Nonetheless, the judiciary is still subject to considerable outside influence. The
 ethics courts allow nonjurists to try cases. The President may appoint military
 judges to try cases in the security courts. The executive branch does not always en-
 force court orders. Detainees may be rearrested under the Emergency Law without
 formal charge, even if previously released by a court. In 1994, in contrast to pre-
 vious years, no defendants in terrorism trials were acquitted on the basis of torture,
 although, according to Egyptian human rights monitors, the majority of such de-
 fendants claimed they had een tortured.
 Since 1992 the Government has tried at least 543 civilian defendants in military
 courts for terrorist acts or membership in subversive organizations. Defendants
 have been tried in groups as few as 8 and as many as 32. The Government claims
 that civilian trials are too lengthy and civilian judges too susceptible to intimidation
 to warrant their use in terrorist cases. In 1994 the Government referred for trial
 in military courts at least 97 civilians for terrorist acts or membership in subversive
 organizations. Through September, these courts sentenced 22 defendants to death,
 42 to prison, and acquitted 3.
 Each military court comprises three military officers. The presiding judge usually
 has general officer rank. In January 1993, the Supreme Constitutional Court upheld
 the use of military courts to try civilian cases. It ruled that the President, acting
 under powers in the Emergency Law, is authorized to refer "any crime" to a military
 court.
 The Government maintains that civilian defendants receive fair trials in the mili-
 tary courts. It argues that all military judges have the same legal training as judges
 in the civilian courts; defense attorneys are accorded sufficient time to review the
 prosecution's files and inspect the State's evidence; trials are conducted under the
 same procedures used in civilian courts; defense attorneys have the right to cross-
 examine and to call any witness; miitary judges a pply only the _Penal Code in trying
 cases involving civilian defendants--no civilian defendant is subject to military law
 or military punishments; there are adequate safeguards against the admission of
 onfessions obtained under duress; defense attorneys are appointed by the Bar Asso-
 ciation at state expense for indigent defendants; verdicts are reviewed by two panels
 of military judges, who examine the trial procedures before they forward the ver-
 dicts to the President for ratification; and all defendants have a constitutional right
 to appeal to the President for clemency.
 However, the military courts do not guarantee the defendants due process before
 an independent tribunal. Both judges and prosecutors are part of the State's execu-
 tive authority. The charge of membership in a broadly defined terrorist group is fre-
 quently vague. Defense attorneys have complained that they have not been given
 sufficient time to prepare defenses. Judges tend to rush cases with many defend-
 ants, so that most trials are completed within 6 weeks or less. Moreover, military
 judges do not appear skilled in the rules of evidence; they have refused to hear wit-
 nesses or admit evidence deemed unimportant, and they do not treat torture com-
 plaints with sufficient seriousness. Defendants have no right of appeal; their sen-
 tences are reviewed by the President of the Republic.
 There are no reliable statistics on the number of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence-In 1994
 there continued to be substantial abridgment, under the Emergency Law, of con-
 stitutional provisions regarding the right to privacy. Under the Constitution, homes,
 correspondence, telephone calls, and other means of communication "shall have
 their own sanctity, and their secrecy shall be guaranteed." Police must obtain war-
 rants before undertaking searches and wiretaps. Courts have dismissed cases in
 which warrants were issued without sufficient cause. Police officials who conduct
 
 
 1069
 searches without proper warrants are subject to criminal penalties, although these
 are seldom imposed.
 The Emergency Law emowers the State to searh persons or places without war-
 rants. Security agencies frequently place political activists, susectel subversives,
 journalists, and writers under surveillance screen their correspondence (especially
 international mail), search them and their homes, and confiscate personal property.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech
 and the press. Egyptians openly express their views on a wide range of political and
 social issues, inc uding vigorous criticism of the Government, without fear of ret-
 ribution. Nonetheless, there are substantial limitations on the freedom of the press.
 The Prime Minister and the Cabinet are often targets of criticism, but the press law
 stipulates fines or imprisonment for criticism of the President or a foreign head of
 state. However, in recent years, opposition journalists have, within limits criticized
 the President without harassment, although he may not be satirized in catoons.
 The Government owns most major dailies, and the President appoints their edi-
 tors in chief. These newspapers generally follow the government line. Nevertheless
 criticisms of government policies are frequently found in the government-owned
 press.
 The opposition newspapers are associated with political parties. Most are
 weeklies, except the centrist daily Al-Wafd and the smaler Islamist semiweekly Al-
 Shaab. All have small circulations. Opposition newspapers frequently publish tough
 criticisms of the Government, inspiring rejoinders from the government-owned
 press. They also give greater prominence to human Tights abuses than the state-
 run newspapers. Most of the opposition press receives foreign funding as well as
 government subsidies and is printed and distributed by a government-owned pub-
 lishing house.
 The Government restricts the press in a number of ways. It controls the right to
 ublish through its power to license newspapers. The Higher Press Council, chaired
 y the Speaker of the Shura Council, has the power to approve applications for new
 publications. Most members of the Higher Press Council are close to the ruling Na-
 tional Democratic Party and are inclined to follow the government line. In a poten-
 tially serious move against the freedom of the press, the Higher Press Council in
 September issued new regulations for licensing new newspapers, requiring appli-
 cants to provide detailed information on sources of financing, editorial structure,
 and, in the case of a political party paper, the party's ideology and platform. The
 regulations may be applied retroactively to existing newspapers and represent a sig-
 nificant tightening of the Government's control over the opposition press.
 Opposition party papers may be called to account for publishing articles deemed
 inconsistent with their official ideologies. In the past, the Government has refused
 to license new parties whose stated platforms 'duplicate" those of existing parties
 (see Section 3).
 As in past years, the Government continued to interfere with freedom of expres-
 sion, arresting and harassing Egyptian and foreign journalists, and confiscating
 printed material from the marketplace. In general, the Government harassed some
 journalists who wrote stories about corruption, portrayed Egypt in an unfavorable
 light, explored human rights and military issues, or who were associated with
 Islamist opposition elements. The Government has used such harassment to indi-
 cate that there are limits to criticism of the Government.
 In March state security officials interrogated journalist Moustafa Bakry for his ar-
 ticle in A-Shaab newspaper in which he critized the security forces' use of violence
 against demonstrators protesting the massacre at the Hebron mosque in February.
 Also interrogated were Adel Hussein, the Chairman of the Socialist Labor Party
 (SLP), and Magy Hussein, Al-Shaab's editor in chief. The three reported they had
 been accused of publishing articles that threatened state security, social order, and
 national unity. The Government did not file charges.
 In the spring, state prosecutors repeatedly interrogated Magdy Hussein and the
 leadership of the SLP in connection with libel suits filed against them by senior gov-
 ernment officials for articles on official corruption. As of late September, two of the
 four cases had been dropped against them.
 In April a court sentenced another reporter for A-Shaab, Abdel Sattar Abu Hus-
 sein, to 1 year in prison for publishing state secrets in an article on U.S.-Egyptian
 military exercises. Abu Hussein claimed his article was derived from open sources.
 He also claimed that after he was arrested, he was held incommunicado for 3 days
 and questioned about another one of his stories on alleged corruption in the military
 industry. In July the Minister of Defense commuted Abu Hussein's sentence to 3
 months, after AlIShaab retracted Abu Hussein's stories.
 
 
 1070
 Also in April, Mohammed Zaky of Al-Wafd newspaper was detained for question-
 ing about the source of an article he wrote on a reported police success in uncover-
 a new terrorist group.
 SJune the authorities detained Magdy Hussein and confiscated his notes after
 he returned from a visit to Yemen. In September security officials again interro-
 gated Mustafa Bakry about foreign funding of A1-Shaab and his articles in another
 newspaper. Al-Ahrar, in which he detailed dissident activity in Saudi Arabia, re-
 peated rumrs about Kg Fahd's health problems, criticized the Egyptian Govern-
 ment for hosting the U.N. International Conference on Population and Development,
 and reported Iraqi press attacks on President Mubaak.
 in December the State Security Prosecutor General remanded Adel Hussein to 15
 days' custody for interrogation into his purported links with the Islamic Group, a
 terrorist organization. Members of the press syndicate staged a hunger strike in
 protest, and local human rights monitors and opposition leader condemned the ar-
 rest and held a series of ralies.
 In 1994 state prosecutors summoned several foreign journalists for questioning
 because they believed their reporting on internal events had damaged Egypt's inter-
 national reputation.
 The Government restricts news coverage on television and radio more tightly than
 newspaper coverage. Criticisms of government policies and reporting on government
 corruption and human rights abuses are almost never broadcast on radio and tele-
 vision. Political parties do not have access to broadcast facilities, even during elec-
 tion campaigns.
 Various ministries are authorized to ban or confiscate books and other works of
 art upon obtaining a court order. The Ministry of Interior regularly confiscates leaf-
 lets and other works by Islamists. In 1994 the Ministry prevented the public sale
 of audio cassette tapes by Islamic preachers whose preachings were considered to
 foment sectarian strife.
 The Ministry of Defense may ban works about sensitive security issues, and plays
 and films must pass Ministry of Culture censorship tests as scripts and as final pro-
 ductions. The Ministry of Culture also censors foreign films but is more lement
 when these are in vi eo format. In 1994 government censors banned the showing
 of the U.S. film, 'Schindler's List," on the grounds of explicit violence, nudity, and
 sex. Government censors ensure that foreign films made in Egypt portray Egypt in
 a favorable light. Censors review scripts before filming, are present during fiTing,
 and have the right to review the film before it is sent out of Egypt.
 The Ministry of Information censors television productions and foreign news pub-
 lications. On occasion in 1994, the Ministry impounded some foreign news publica-
 tions before they were released. The Ministry does not usually inform the manage-
 ment of foreign publications of the reasons for impoundments. In 1994 the Ministry
 banned or delayed the distribution of nine issues of the English-language weekly,
 The Middle East Times. Those issues carried stories on government corruption,
 human rights violations, and the Government's security campaign against extrem-
 ists.
 The Islamic Research Institute at AI-Azhar University has legal authority to cen-
 sor, but not to confiscate, all publications dealing with the Koran and Islamic scrip-
 tural texts. In recent years, however, the Institute has passed judgment on the suit-
 ability of nonreligious books and artistic productions. In February an advisory coun-
 cil in the judiciary issued an opinion expanding A1-Azhar's censorship to include vis-
 ual and audio artistic works. in response, the Minister of Culture issued a state-
 ment describing the court's decision as advisory and not binding upon the Govern-
 ment. In the past, President Mubarak has publicly approved A1-Azhar's censorship
 role, but in 1994 he stated that the Government would not allow confiscation of
 books from the market without a court order.
 As in recent years, moderate Muslims and secularist writers have found them-
 selves under attack by extremists. In October suspected extremists attempted to as-
 sassinate Nagib Mabfouz Nobel Laureate and antifundamentalist critic, whose
 novel,  The Children of te Gebelawi," has been banned from public sale by Al-
 Azhar since 1959 because it is considered blasphemous. Following the murder at-
 tempt, the press published the novel in a show of solidarity with Mahfouz and secu-
 lar intellectuals (see Section l.a.).
 The Government does not generally restrict academic freedom at universities.
 However, in May the People's Assembly amended the Education Law to authorize
 university presidents to appoint deans of faculties. Under the previous law, faculty
 deans were elected by their peers. The Government justified the measure as a
 means to combat Islamist influence in the school system.
 In January a court ruled against Islamist lawyers who had petitioned the court
 to divorce Nasr Abu Zeid, an Arabic language professor at Cairo University, from
 
 
 1071
 his wife on grounds that Abu Zeid's writings on the Koran were heretical. The peti-
 tioners argued that, as a heretic, Abu Zeid should not be allowed to remain married
 to a Muslim woman in a Muslim country. The court found the petitioners had no
 standing to file a divorce suit. The case was in appeal at year's end.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-There continue to be substan-
 tial restrictions on this freedom Under a 1923 law, citizens must obtain approval
 from the Ministry of Interior before holding public meetings, rallies, and protest
 marches. Permits are generally granted for rallies held indoors or on university
 campuses.
 In May security forces broke up a demonstration of lawyers protesting the death
 in police custody of Abdel Hareth Madani (see Section l.a.). Wen the  emonstrat-
 ing lawyers attempted to enter the street, the police moved in with tear gas and
 clubs. The Government had denied the Bar Association's request for a permit for
 a protest march, and thus termed the demonstration illegal.
 Under Law 32 of 1964, the Ministr of Social Affairs has sweeping authority over
 all Egyptian "private organizations, including the right to license and dissolve
 them, confiscate their properties, appoint members to their boards, and interfere in
 other internal administrative matters. Licenses may be revoked if such organiza-
 tions engage in political or religious activities. The law authorizes the Ministry to
 "merge two or more associations to achieve a similar function," a provision that can
 be used to merge an undesirable organization out of existence.
 In 1994 the Ministry dissolved a nongovernmental organization which had re-
 ceived unauthorized funds from a Kuwaiti group, the Society for the Revival of the
 Islamic Heritage. The Government expelled several Kuwaiti citizens associated with
 the organization, asserting that the organization had distributed funds to extrem-
 ists. In August the Ministry announced that all organizations receiving charitable
 funds from abroad would be obliged to transfer the funds to the Ministry for dis-
 tribution.
 Since 1985, the Government has refused under Law 32 to license the EOHR and
 the Arab Organization for Human Rights (AOR) on grounds that they are political
 organizations. Both continue to operate openly (see Section 4). Similarly, the request
 by Amnesty International (AI) for legal status for its local chapter has been pending
 with the Government for 4 years. Until recently, the Government allowed Al to op-
 erate freely, but in October it informed Al's local chapter that it would no longer
 be allowed to hold meetings, pending a decision on its request for legal status. The
 Government say sit is still studying that request.
 Under 1993 legislation on professional associations, an association must elect its
 governing board by at least 50 percent of its general membership. Failing a quorum,
 a second election must be held in which at least 33 per cent of the membership
 votes in the beard. If such a quorum is impossible, the judiciary may appoint a care-
 taker board until new elections can be set. The law was adopted to prevent further
 gains in the professional syndicates by Islamist candidates.
 c. Freedom of Rel 4gon.-The Constitution provides freedom of belief and the prac-
 tice of religious rites. However, there are important limitations. Islam is the state
 religion. Most Egyptians are Muslim, but approximately 10 per cent of the popu-
 lation, 5 million people, belong to the Coptic Orthodox Church, the largest Christian
 minority in the Middle East. There are other small Christian denominations. The
 small Jewish community practices its religion without harassment. Members of rec-
 ognized religions maintain links with coreligionists abroad. The foreign clergy pur-
 sue their ministries without harassment, but the law effectively bars non- mus
 from proselytizing.
 Islam accepts Christian and other converts, but Muslims face legal problems if
 they convert to another faith. There is no clear legal prohibition against conversion
 or proselytizing, but Article 98f of the Penal Code prohibits any person from 'de-
 grading or disdaining any of the holy religions or any of its religious sects" with "the
 intention of harming national unity and social peace." This is interpreted as forbid-
 ding the conversion of Muslims by non-Muslims. Conviction is punishable by 6
 months' to 5 years' imprisonment. In 1993 the authorities twice arrested an Egyp-
 tian lay missionary for preparing Christian missionary literature for publication. A
 court ordered his release from detention in March.
 In July the Minister of Education issued a decree prohibiting local school officials
 from requiring schoolgirls to wear the hegab (head scarf) without parental consent
 on school grounds. A group of lawyers and parents, who favored the hegab, chal-
 lenged the decree. An administrative court ruled against the Minister, but his de-
 cree was later upheld by an appellate court.
 The courts have upheld the principle that Muslims cannot change their identity
 papers to reflect their conversion to a new religion. As a consequence, married male
 
 
 1072
 converts from Islam must register their children as Muslims, as the law considers
 them to be Muslims.
 In the past, state security forces have harassed and detained for prolonged periods
 Egyptian Christians accused of proselytizing Muslims. In November 193, security
 forces arrested six Coptic Christians who had sought to dissuade another Coptic
 Christian, who was also arrested, from converting to Islam. All seven persons were
 held in detention without formal charge. The Supreme State Security Court ordered
 their release in May.
 An 1856 Ottoman decree still in force requires non-Muslims to obtain what is now
 a presidential decree to build or repair a place of worship. Coptic Christians main-
 tain they are frequently unable to obtain such authorization or are blocked by the
 security forces from using the authorizations that have been issued. As a result,
 some communities use private buildings and apartments for religious services. From
 1992 to 1994, the Government increased the number of building permits issued to
 Christian communities to an average of more than 20 a year, compared to the aver-
 age of 5 permits issued annually in the 1980's. Most permits appear to be for the
 repair of existing structures and not for new onstruction of churches. Christian and
 Muslim reformers urge the abolition of the Ottoman decree, but Islamists defend the
 building restrictions.
 According to human rights and legal sources, the Government in June closed two
 buildings in an unzoned area near Alexandria which had been used by Coptic Evan-
 gelical Christians since 1990 for church activities. Church lawyers are pursuing a
 legal suit against the closures. The lawyers maintain that the closures violate pre-
 vious court rulings upholding the right to conduct religious services in private build-
 ings without prior government approval. They also point out that the closed build-
 ings are located in an area were unlicensed buildings are common. In July security
 forces arrested a Coptic Christian who protested the closures in letters published
 in newspapers. The police released the individual after 10 days' detention after he
 signed a statement binding him not to discuss the closures in public.
 In theory, mosques must also be licensed by the Government, but the Government
 reports approximately half of the estimated 70,000 mosques in Egypt are unli-
 censed. The Penal Code prohibits using a place of worship for antigovernment
 speeches, and the Ministry of Religious Affairs proposes themes and monitors ser-
 mons. In practice, the Government cannot control all sermons, especially at "unau-
 thorized" mosques where sermons may invoke antigovernment, anti-Christian, and
 anti-Western themes. In 1994 the Government increased efforts to bring private
 mosques under its administrative control as a means to counter Islamic extremism.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-Egyptians and foreigners are free to travel within Egypt except in cer-
 tain military areas. Males who have not completed compulsory miitary service may
 not travel abroad or emigrate, although this restriction can be circumvented. Un-
 married women under 21 must have permission from their fathers to obtain pass-
 ports and travel; married women require the same permission from their husbands.
 Citizens who leave the country have the right to return.
 i recent years, the Government has denied permission to Christian converts from
 Islam to travel abroad. The deportation of citizens and aliens granted political asy-
 lum is prohibited and not practiced.
 Egypt is host to thousands of refugees, but only a few are granted the right to
 resettle in Egypt. In the past, some Ethiopians and other Africans, who seek docu-
 mentation as refugees by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, have
 been detained by the police and then transported to areas near the Libyan or Suda-
 nese borders where they are released. Some have returned to their countries; others
 have found their way back to Egyptian cities.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The ruling National Democratic Party (NDP) dominates the 454-seat People's As-
 sembly, the Shura Council, local governments, the mass media, labor, the large pub-
 lic sector, and the licensing of new political parties, newspapers, and private organi-
 zations to such an extent that, as a practical matter, Egyptians do not have a mean-
 ingful ability to change the national government.
 In 1993 President Hosni Mubarak was elected unopposed to a third 6-year term
 by the People's Assembly. In October of that year, his reelection was approved by
 96 percent of the voters in a national referendum. The Government claimed that
 86per cent of the electorate went to the polls although observers judged that the
 actla figure was much lower. The electorate was not presented with a choice
 among competing presidential candidates; it was offered the opportunity only to vote
 for or against Mubarak's reelection. Two opposition parties, the Wafd and the
 
 
 1073
 Islamist-affiliated Socialist Labor Party, urged the public to boycott the referendum,
 and two other parties, the leftist Tagammu and the Nasserist Party, urged the pub-
 lic to vote against President Mubarak. The other opposition parties endorsed
 Mubaraks candidacy.
 In June the Government convened a "national dialog" conference of figures in poli.
 tics, labor, the media, and intellectuals to discuss the country's future priorities. Al-
 though the Government had stated that the dialog would be open to various views,
 it strictly controlled the agnda and the selection of the delegates, who were over-
 whelmingy drawn from NDP members and sympathizers. The Government invited
 the opposition parties to send three representatives each. Two  ies boycotted the
 conferene. At the onference, the Government disallowed any dsuion of constitu-
 tional reform, nor did it address such topics as human rights.
 Acting on recommendations from the dialog, President M ubarak in October issued
 edicts amening or aboishing several old laws on poitical party registration, can-
 didates for public office, and elections. However, at year's end, he has not indicated
 how or when the more substantial political reforms recommended by the dialog
 might be implemented.
 he 1990 People's Assembly election, NDP candidates won 383 seats of 444
 elected, independents won 55, and a leftist party won 6. Seven opposition parties
 boycotted the election. The Constitution reserves 10 Assembly seats for presidential
 appointees, assuring some representation for Coptic Christians and women. Women
 were granted suffrage in 1956. Ten women hold Assembly seats: 7 elected and 3 ap-
 pointed. One Copt is in the Cabinet and five Copts sit in the Assembly: one elected
 and four appointed.
 The Assembly debates government proposals, and members exercise their author-
 ity to call cabinet ministers to explain policy, but it does not have sufficient author-
 ity to challenge or restrain the executive in the areas of security or foreign policy.
 The Assembly can exercise significant influence over economic policies, primarily by
 blocking governmental initiatives. The executive initiates almost all legislation; the
 Assembly may not modify the budget except with the Government's approval, and
 there is little oversight of the Interior Ministry's use of Emergency Law powers.
 Many executive branch initiatives and policies are carried out by ministerial decree
 without significant legislative oversight. The military budget is prepared by the ex-
 ecutive and not debated publicly. Presidential appointees do not require legislative
 approval. Roll-call votes in the Assembly are rare. Votes are generally reported in
 aggregate terms of yeas and nays, and thus constituents have no independent meth-
 od of checking a member's voting record.
 There are 12 recognized opposition parties. The law empowers the Government
 to bring felony charges against those who form a party without a license. New par-
 ties must be approved by the Parties Committee, a semiofficial body dominated by
 the ruling National Democratic Party. Since the late 1970's, the Committee has
 granted a license to only one opposition party-the Wafd Party. Other parties have
 en granted licenses by presidential decrees or by court orders. The sole application
 to form a new party in 1994, from the Egyptian Popular Democratic Party, was
 pending at year's end.
 In January the Political Parties Court rejected the 1993 application of the Social
 Justice Party. In February the Higher Administrative Court upheld a lower court
 ruling which disapproved the establishment of the Peace Party.
 The law prohibits political parties based on religion. Nevertheless, Muslim Broth-
 erhood partisans are publicly known and openly speak their views. Some have
 served in the Assembly as independents or members of other recognized parties.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The Government refuses to license local human rights organizations as private en-
 tities under Law 32 of 1964 (see Section 2.b.) on the grounds that they are political
 organizations. Appeals from the Egyptian Organization for Human Rights (EOHR)
 and the associated Arab Organization for Human Rights (AOHR) on the ruling on
 their legal status are still before the courts. AOHR has successfully registered as
 a foreign organization with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Despite its nonrecogni-
 tion, the EOHR operates openly, its field workers visit prisons and government of-
 fices, and the Government does not interfere with its funding from foreign human
 rights organizations. Other activists have successfully registered their human rights
 organizations as corporations under the commercial law, thus skirting the obstacles
 posed by Law 32.
 In May an EOHR staff member, who was also a defense lawyer for persons ar-
 rested in an unauthorized demonstration at the Bar Association headquarters (see
 
 
 1074
 Section 1.c.), was arrested ostensibly on grounds of inciting public disorder and
 questioned extensively about his activities at the EOHR.
 In June representatives of the New York-based Human Rights Watch complained
 of overt surveillance by state security officers during one of their field trips to upper
 Egypt. In September the EOHR reported that state security officers ordered EOQ's
 publsher not to distribute copies of EOHR's 1993 annual report.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Relgion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 Women.-The law provides for equality of the sexes, but aspects of the law and
 many traditional practices discriminate against women. By law women need their
 husbands' or fathers' permission to obtain a passport or travel abroad (Section 2.d.).
 Only males can confer citizenship. In rare cases, this means that children born to
 Egyptian mothers and stateless fathers are themselves stateless.
 Laws affecting marriage and personal status generally correspond to an individ-
 ual's religion, w  or most Egyptians is Islam. A 1979 hl eralization of the Family
 Status Law strengthened a Mu-slim woman's rights to divorce and to child custody.
 In 1985, however, the changes were found unconstitutional on grounds that they
 conflicted with Islamic law and were repealed.
 Under Islamic law non-Muslim males must convert to Islam to marry Muslim
 women, but non-Muslim women need not convert to marry Muslim men. Muslim fe-
 male heirs receive half the amount of a male heir's inheritance, while Christian wid-
 ows of Muslims have no inheritance rights. A sole female heir receives half her par-
 ents' estate; the balance goes to designated male relatives. A sole male heir inherits
 all his parents' property. Male Muslim heirs have the duty to provide for all family
 members who need assistance.
 Egyptian women have employment opportunities in government, medicine, law,
 academia, the arts, and, to a lesser degree, in business. About 100 officers in the
 Egyptian diplomatic service are women, including 3 ambassadors. There are no
 women judges. Although there is no legal basis to prohibit women judges, a woman
 under consideration for promotion to magistrate was denied the promotion on the
 basis of gender in 1993 and is suing the Government.
 Social pressure against women pursuing a career is strong, and some Egyptian
 feminists say that a resurgent Islamic fundamentalist trend limits further gains.
 Women's rights advocates also point to other discriminatory attitudes and practices
 such as female genital mutilation (FGM) and the male relative's role in enforcing
 women's compliance with religiously prescribed codes of sexual conduct.
 Family violence against women occurs and is reflected in press accounts of specific
 incidents. Official or nonofficial quantitative data do not exist. In general, the inter-
 vention of neighbors and extended family members tends to limit the prevalence
 and scope of such violence. Abuse within the family is rarely discussed publicly,
 owing to the value attached to privacy in this traditional society. Neither the gov-
 ernment, nongovermental organizations, or human rights organizations has com-
 mented publicly upon family violence.
 There are at least two active women's rights groups, one affiliated with the
 EOHR. The other is the Communications Group for the Enhancement of the Status
 of Women, which has published a booklet on the legal rights of Egyptian women.
 Children.-The Government remains committed to the protection of children's
 welfare within the limits of its budgetary resources. Many of the resources for chil-
 dren's welfare are provided by international donors, especially in the field of child
 immunization. Child labor is widespread, despite the Government's commitment to
 eradicate it.
 International health experts have condemned female genital mutilation (FGM) as
 damaging to physical and mental health. Statistics on the prevalence of FGM vary,
 but government and private sources agree it is common among 70 to 80 per cent
 of rural and poor urban women. The act is generally performed on girls between
 the ages of 7 and 10, probably with equal prevalence among Muslims and Coptic
 Christians.
 A 1959 decree and subsequent amendments, which described the practice as "psy-
 chologically harmful," limited the practice to excision. However, the more drastic
 infibulation is practiced in some parts of southern Egypt. The decree prohibited doc-
 tors from performing the excision in government health facilities. Current law stipu-
 lates penalties for nonmedical practitioners; a barber was sentenced in November
 to a year at hard labor for circumcising a child. However, the law does not stipulate
 punishment for parents who violate the law. Following public outcry in 1994 over
 foreign television airing of the circumcision of a 9-year old girl, the Minister of
 Health, in the company of religious leaders, announced the Government would hold
 its first conference on FGM. The Government also broadcast television programs
 
 
 1075
 condemning the practice. The Sheikh of A1-Azhar, head of the world's oldest institu-
 tion of Islamic thought, has issued a decree declaring FGM a religiously mandated
 duty. His ruling could hamper any public educational efforts by the Government.
 eli   s Minonties.-The approximately 5 mllion Coptic Christians are the ob-
 jects of occasional violent assaults by Islamic extremists and of discrimination by
 the Government. In 1994 Islamic extremists are believed to have been responsible
 for killing at least eight Coptic residents of Assiyut governorate, including the shoot-
 ing of six pilgrims at a monastery. The area of Dairut, Assiyut governorate, the
 scene of a massacre of 13 Coptic residents in 1992, is reportedly still tense. Local
 Coptic residents fear for their personal safety when traveling outside their homes.
 Extremists have obstructed church repairs and construction and harassed Copt-
 owned businesses. Christians have complained that the Government is lax in pro-
 tecting Coptic lives and property. Security forces arrest extremists who perpetrate
 violence against Copts, but the Coptic community does not believe the Government
 is vigorous in its efforts to prevent the attacks and does little to correct nonviolent
 forms of discrimination, including its own.
 Government discriminatory   practices include: suspected  statistical under-
 representation of the size of the Christian population; delays in issuing church
 building and repair permits and obstruction of permits obtained; the detention and
 mistreatment of some Muslim converts to Christianity; laws that prevent Muslims
 from changing their identity papers to reflect their conversion to Christianity
 (upheld in a 1980 court decision); anti-Christian discrimination in education, illus-
 trated by the requirement that public school students, including Christians, memo-
 rize Koranic verses as part of their Arabic studies; a public school ban on the hiring
 of Christian Arabic teachers as the curriculum involves the study of the Koran; the
 production of Islamic television programs, some with anti-Christian themes; job dis-
 crimination in the public sector, the police, the armed forces, and government agen-
 cies; reported discrimination against Christians in admission to state medical
 schools; and under representation in government. There are no Coptic governors and
 no Copts in the upper ranks of the military, police, and diplomatic service.
 People With Disabilities.-There are approximately 5.7 million disabled persons in
 Egypt, of whom 1.5 million are severely disabled. The Government makes serious
 efforts to address their rights. It works closely with United Nations agencies and
 other international aid donors to design job-training programs for the disabled. The
 Government also seeks to increase the public's awareness of the capabilities of the
 disabled in television programming, the print media, and in educational material in
 public schools. By law, all businesses must designate 5 percent of their jobs for the
 disabled who are exempted from normal literacy requirements. Although there is
 no leglation mandating access to public accommodations and transportation, the
 disabled may ride government-owned mass transit buses without charge, are given
 priority in obtaining telephones, and receive reductions on customs duty for private
 vehicles.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Egyptian workers may, but are not required to, join
 trade unions. A union local, or worker's committee, may be formed if 50 employees
 express a desire to organize. Most union members, about 25 per cent of the labor
 force, are employed by state-owned enterprises. The law stipulates that "high ad-
 ministrative" officials in government and the public sector may not join unions.
 There are 23 industrial unions, all required to belong to the Egyptian Trade
 Union Federation (ETUF), the sole legally recognized labor federation. The Inter-
 national Labor Organization's Committee of Experts (COE) has repeatedly empha-
 sized that a law requiring all trade unions to be ongt a single federation infringes
 on the freedom of association. The Government has shown no sign that it intends
 to accept the establishment of more than one federation. The ETUF leadership as.
 serts that it actively promotes worker interests and that there is no need for an-
 other federation. ETUF officials have close relations with the NDP, and some are
 members of the People's Assembly and the Shura Council. They speak vigorously
 on behalf of worker concerns, but public confrontations between ETUF and the Gov-
 ernment are rare. Disputes are more often resolved by consensus behind closed
 doors.
 Some unions within ETUF are affiliated with international trade union organiza-
 tions. Others are in the process of doing so.
 The Government is in the process of drafting a new labor law which has not yet
 been submitted to the Peoples Assembly. The law is expected to be debated in the
 spring of 1995. The proposed law provides statutory authorization for the rights to
 strke and to collective bargaining. Under current labor laws such rights are not
 adequately guaranteed. Even though the right to strike is not guaranteed, strikes
 
 
 1076
 occur. The Government considers strikes a form of public disturbance and hence ille-
 gal.
 In October the police used force to break up a public demonstration in support
 of a strike by several thousand textile workers at the northern town of Kar al-
 Duwar. In putting down the demonstration, the police killed at least 5 persons, in-
 cluding a 12-year-old child, arrested more than 100 demonstrators. Sixty demonstra-
 tors were injured.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The draft labor law provides
 statutory authorization for collective bargaining. Under the current law, unions may
 negotiate work contracts with public sector enterprises if the latter agrees to suh
 negotiations, but unions otherwise lack collective bargaining power in the state sec-
 tor. Under current circumstances, collective bargaining does not exist in any mean-
 ingful sense because the Government sets wages, benefits, and job classifications by
 law. Larger firms in the private sector generally adhere to such government-man-
 dated standards.
 Labor law and practice are the same in the export processing zones as in the rest
 of the country.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced or compulsory labor is ille-
 gal and not practiced.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The minimum age for employment
 is 12. Education is compulsory until age 15. An employee must be at least 15 to
 join a labor union. The Labor Law of 1981 states that children aged 12 to 15 may
 work 6 hours a day but not after 7 p.m. and not in dangerous or heavy activities.
 Child workers must obtain medical certificates and work permits before they are
 employed.
 A 1988 survey found that 1.4 million children between the ages of 6 and 14 are
 employed-about 7 percent of the total work force. A 1989 study estimated that two-
 thirds of child labor, perhaps 720,000 children, work on farms. However, children
 also work as apprentices in repair and craft shops, in heavier industries such as
 brickmaking and textiles, and as workers in leather factories and carpet-making,
 which largely supplies the export market. While local trade unions report that the
 Ministry of Labor adequately enforces the labor laws in state-owned enterprises, en-
 forcement in the private sector, especially in family-owned enterprises, is lax.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-For government and public-sector employees,
 the minimum wage is approximately $20 a month for a 6-day, 48-hour workweek.
 Base pay is supplementedby a complex system of fringe benefits and bonuses that
 may ouble or triple a worker's take-home pay. It is doubtful that the average fam-
 ily could survive on a worker's base pay at the minimum wage rate. The minimum
 wage is also legally binding on the private sector, and larger private companies gen-
 erally observe the requirement and pay bonuses as well. Smaller firms do not al-
 ways pay the minimum wage or bonuses. The Ministry of Labor sets worker health
 and safety standards, which also apply in the export processing zones, but enforce-
 ment and inspection are uneven.
