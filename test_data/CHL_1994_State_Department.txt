 CHILE
 Chile is a multiparty democracy based upon a Constitution which provides for a
 strong executive, a bicameral legislature, and an independent judiciary. Approved
 by referendum in 1980, the Constitution was written under the former military gov-
 ernment and contains limits on popular rule. Chile's second consecutive democrat-
 ically elected president, Eduardo Frei, began a 6-year term on March 11. A new
 Congress comprising 120 Deputies and 46 Senators was sworn in the same day. Ap-
 pointees of former dictator General Pinochet continued to dominate the constitu-
 tionally independent judicial branch.
 The armed forces are constitutionally subordinate to the President through an ap-
 pointed Minister of Defense, but enjoy a large degree of legal autonomy. Most nota-
 bly, the President must have the concurrence of  e multi-institutional National Se-
 curity Council to remove service chiefs. President Frei asked Gen. Stange, Com-
 mander of Carabineros (the uniformed police), to resign in April following a judicial
 charge of covering up evidence in a 1985 murder case, but he refused, the charges
 
 
 342
 were dropped, and he remains in place. The Carabineros have primary responsibil-
 ity for public order and safety, and border security. The civilian Investigations Po-
 lice is responsible for criminal investigations. Both o rfnizatios, although formally
 under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Defnse-whch determines their budget-
 are under operational control of the Minister of Interior. Elements of both forces
 continued to be accused of human rights abuses, including police brutality. Some no-
 torious alleIed perpetrtrs of human rights abuses durng the previous regime re-
 main on active dut   tem army.
 ï¿½The export-oriented economy experienced its eleventh consecutive year of expan-
 sion in 1994. The moat important export was copper, with fresh fruit, fish meal, and
 manufactured goods also important sources of foreign exchange. Gross domestic
 product grew more than 4 percent, unemployment increased to about 6 percent, and
 inflation fell for the fourth consecutive year, to 8.9 percent.
 Five years aftr the transition to democracy, the principal human rights issues
 in Chile relate to abuses that occurred during the former military government. Ef-
 forts to do justice in those cases are limited by sometimes conflicting requirements
 for justice and national reconciliation. In particular, the courts continue to struggle
 with the application of the 1978 amnesty to cases that occurred during the first 5
 years of military rule. However, in March a ci an court convicted 15 Carabinere s
 of the 1985 murder of 3 Communist leaders and sentenced 6 to life terms. The judi-
 cial system continued to investigate, with mixed success, a number of other pending
 human rights cases, but human rights monitors criticized the preferential treatment
 given some human rights abusers. Continuing human rights abuses include in-
 stances of police brutality and torture, prior restraint of the press, social discrimina-
 tion against ethnic minorities and indigenous people, and individual acts of violence
 against women and children.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Kiling.-There were no reports of political
 killings.
 No terrorists died in confrontations with police in 1994, but the Defense Commit-
 tee of the Peoples' Rights (CODEPU) claimed that two criminals died in shootouts
 because the police used excessive force. The circumstances remain unclear.
 The plice arrested several leaders of Chile's two main terrorist groups, the Dis-
 sident Wing of the Manuel Rodriguez Patriotic Front (FPMR/D) and the Lautaro
 Youth Movement, responsible for most of the political violence since the return of
 democratic government in 1990. The arrests included Guillermo Ossandon, the most
 wanted terrorist, and founder and leader of the Lautaro Youth, who was arraigned
 for 600 crimes, including 25 homicides, the Lautaro committed under his leaders hip.
 The courts succeeded in bringing to justice some gvernment agents who used po-
 litical violence in the past. Special investigating Judge Milton Juica convicted 15
 former police agents from the former Carabinero Intelligence Unit, Dicomcar, and
 their civilian informant for kidnaping and murder in the 1985 death of 3 Com-
 munist Party members. He sentenced them to prison terms, including some life sen-
 tences. The Court of Appeals confirmed life sentences for six agents, one of them
 the former head of operations of Dicomcar. The case remains under appeal. A mili-
 tary court investigated Carabinero Commanding General Stange and five retired
 Carabinero generals for obstruction of justice in covering up the crime, but deter-
 mined they had ommitted no ilmegal acts, a ruling that was onfirmed by the Su-
 preme Court.
 The Fourth Chamber of the Supreme Court ruled in November that another
 former Carabinero captain in Dicorocar should serve his 3-year sentence for the
 1985 death of socialist Carlos Godoy Echegoyen in the penitentiary, reversing a rul-
 ing by the military court of appeals that granted him probation. The Supreme Court
 also ruled that army Captain Pedro Fernandez Dittus should serve 600 days in pris-
 on for his responsibility in the burning death of Rodrigo Rojas Denegri and the seri-
 ous burns sustained by Carmen Gloria Quintana in July 1986. The case was the
 first in which a military court had ruled in favor of human rights victims, but the
 military court of appeals in 1991 reduced Fernandez's sentence to 300 days and al-
 lowed his release on probation. The Supreme Court did not determine who was re-
 sponsible for the injuries, but ruled that the captain had been negligent for not at-
 tending to the victims.
 The Supreme Court is still reviewing Justice Adolfo Banados' sentencing of Gen.
 Manuel Contreras and Colonel Pedro Espinoza to 7- and 6-year prison terms re-
 spectively, as the intellectual authors of the 1976 murder in Washington, D.. of
 former Chilean Foreign Minister Orlando Letelier and his American assistant,
 
 
 343
 Ronni Moffitt. The two defendants remained free on bail in the only case involving
 DINA-the Pinochet-era secret police-that was specifically excluded from the 1978
 amnesty law covering most political crimes before that date.
 The courts have not issued findings in the investigations requested by the Min-
 ister of Interior into the 1993 deaths of two prisoners in police custody. Police com-
 manders who conducted their own internal investigations were rumored to have
 punished those involved, but this has not been announced publicly. The Supreme
 Court ruled that a civilian judge should continue to investigate the two deaths that
 occurred during demonstrations sponsored by leftist and human rights groups on
 September 11, 1993, the twentieth anniversary of the 1973 coup.
 The Supreme Court maintained jurisdiction over the investigation into the 1976
 murder of Carmelo Soria, a Spanish citizen employed by the United Nations. A mili-
 tary court applied the amnesty to the case in December 1993, but in April the First
 Chamber of the Supreme Court ordered that the case be reopened to investigate sev-
 eral issues before a decision could be made on applying the amnesty. Supreme Court
 Justice Eleodoro Ortiz changed procedures and began interviewing military wit-
 nesses on military bases, rather than in court, so the press could not subject them
 to scrutiny.
 The Third Court of Appeals reopened the investigation into possible involvement
 of several active duty and retired military officers in the 1974 murder of Movement
 of the Revolutionary Left (MIR) activist Lumi Videla, and the Eighth Court of Ap-
 peals overruled a military court's application of the amnesty to the 1974 disappear-
 ances of MIR members Barbara Uribe and Edwin Van Jurick, on the grounds that
 the amnesty could not apply because the cases involved a violation of the Geneva
 Convention. Constitutional specialist Humberto Nogueira -rTote bath opinions. The
 cases are being appealed to the Supreme Court but the ruling, if upheld, would set
 an important precedent for other human rights cases.
 In other cases, military courts continued their long standing practice of applying
 the 1978 amnesty law to crimes involving members of the armed forces, without
 conducting an investigation to identify the perpetrators. In December the Supreme
 Court upheld a military court's decision to apply the amnesty to the disappearances
 of 78 persons who had been detained by DINA. Human rights lawyers had initiated
 the case before the amnesty was enacted in 1978, and only one of the victims' bodies
 was located. Under the military government, the military courts had closed such in-
 vestigations without applying the amnesty, but after the 1988 plebiscite paved the
 way for a return to democracy (see Section 3), the military courts began to apply
 the amnesty. About 100 cases have now been closed through the amnesty, 300 cases
 are active, and an additional 800 cases remain temporarily closed.
 In a case where the amnesty does not apply, the authorities extradited retired
 Army Major Carlos Herrera from Argentina for the 1982 murder of Tucapel Ji-
 menez, but the Supreme Court transferred him from the custody of prison wardens
 to confinement on a military base. Human rights advocates claimed that former
 DINA agents are among his guards, making it difficult for Herrera to cooperate with
 the courts. Retired Army Major Alvaro Corbalan, the commander of an intelligence
 unit accused of committing a related murder, remains under detention on a military
 base, but there were newspaper reports that he held several political meetings while
 confined.
 b. Disappearane.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 A number of pre-1978 disappearance cases are still in the courts. The Aylwin Gov-
 ernment argued that under the amnesty law, these kidnaping cases cannot be closed
 and the alleged perpetrator amnestied unless a court determines that the victim
 died while the amnesty was in effect. That argument requires that the courts locate
 the remains of the deceased or determine the circumstances of their death before
 applying the amnesty. However, military courts ignore this view and apply the am-
 nesty to pre-1978 cases of "illegal arrest" when they presume the victim is dead.
 For example, on September 5 the Santiago military court applied the amnesty to
 the 1974 kidnaping of the Andrnico brothers without serving an arrest warrant on
 Army Lt. Colonel Fernando Laureani (see Section 1.e.).
 In November the First Chamber of the Supreme Court allowed civilian courts to
 continue to investigate three disappearance cases. Human rights lawyer Nelson
 Caucoto said the Supreme Court had denied military jurisdiction only twice before
 in such appeals. Caucoto was one of the lawyers representing the families of the
 78 people who disappeared after detention by DINA (see Section L.a.). When the Su-
 preme Court upheld the military court's application of the amnesty in that case, he
 announced his intention to appeal the case to the Inter-American Commission on
 Human Rights on the grounds that all legal means had been exhausted to bring the
 guilty parties to justice under the Chilean judicial system.
 
 
 344
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Dqe  g     Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution forbids 'the use of illegal pressure on detainees but the United
 Nations Special Rapporteur on Torture fond ns     es of mistreatment and abuse
 by some Carabinero and Investigations police units. CODEPU lawyers visit detain-
 ees during their interrogation (see Section 1.d.) and reresent many suspected ter-
 rorist in court. During a 1.year period that ended Otober 1, CODEPU alleged
 there were 16 cases of torture by Carabineros. 6 by Invest tions police, and 2 by
 prison guards which it brought to the attention of the U.N. Special Rapporteur.
 Lawyers on a commission studying judicial reform believe the inquisitorial approach
 used in Chile encorages the use of torture. Since the judge uses written records,
 a confession appears to be important evidence, even if it was obtained under duress.
 In October the Santiago Court of appeals threw out the convictions of 11 members
 of the FPMR because the investigating judge relied on confessions that  lice had
 obtained with torture. Human rights lawyers hailed the ruling. CODEPU also re-
 ports that its complaints of police abuses for a 1-year period ending October 1 re-
 sulted in 30 administrative reviews by Carabineros and 11 by Investigations Police.
 The Investigations Police created an ethics squad to investigate reports of police
 abuse, including allegations of torture.
 The Minister of Interior normally asks the courts to conduct independent inves-
 tigations of credible complaints of police abuse, but such investigations rarely re-
 suited in arrests, due in part to the reluctance of members of the judiciary, many
 of them appointed by the military regime, to pursue the issue vigorously. However,
 as indicated in the CODEPU report, police authorities often impose administrative
 sanctions without waiting for a judicial ruling.
 Under intense pressure from Brazil in late 1993, the Supreme Court appointed
 Judge Alejandro Solis to investigate allegations by a Brazilian psychologist, Tania
 Maria Cordeiro, that Investigations Police tortured and raped her in March 1993
 when they arrested her boarder for possession of arms used by Lautaro terrorists
 in bank robberies. Judge Solis ordered the arrest of eight policemen including
 Zvonco Farias, the head of an Investigations Police station, for procedural irregular-
 ities in the case and for detaining Cordeiro's 13-year-old daughter as psychological
 pressure to obtain a confession, but he did not find proof of torture. The policemen
 appealed the charges and are free on bail.
 Chilean prisons are overcrowded and antiquated, but the conditions are not life
 threatening. Food meets minimal nutritional needs, and prisoners may supplement
 the diet by buying food. Those with sufficient funds can often rent space in a better
 wing of the prison. Although prison guards have been accused of using excessive
 force to stop attempted prison breaks, the guards generally behave responsibly and
 do not mistreat prisoners.
 A new maximum security prison houses about 80 prisoners, most of them charged
 with or convicted of terrorism. Some of the prisoners claimed that security measures
 that prevent them from meeting as a group violated their rights. They refused to
 leave their cells to appear in court and went on a hunger strike demanding the con-
 ditions be relaxed. The courts have repeatedly investigated the complaint, and the
 Human Rights Committee of Congress, journalis   andthe International   mmittee
 of the Red Cross (ICRC) visited the prison. The Chilean Human Rights Commission
 and the congressional committee criticized wardens for not giving these prisoners
 the opportunity to perform prison labor or engage in group exercise. The ICRC
 closed its Santiago office in 1993, saying that there was no longer a need for prison
 visits, but it sent delegates from Brazil for the visit.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exie.-The Constitution allows civilian and mili-
 tary courts to order detention for up to 5 days without arraignment and extend the
 detention for up to 10 days for suspected terrorist acts. The law affords detainees
 30 minutes of immediate and daily access to a lawyer (in the presence of a prison
 guard) and to a doctor to verify their physical condition. The law does not permit
 a judge to deny such access; police authorities generally observed these require-
 ments.
 It is quite common for the police to make arrests based on suspicion, particularly
 of youth in high crime areas late at night. The Chilean Human Rights Commission
 reported as many as a thousand arrests some weeks and said that 80 percent of
 those detained are released without charges after a few hours or a few days. Arrest
 procedures do not require police to allow detainees to telephone their parents or
 lawyer which causes particular anguish for distraught parents. However, statistics
 show that the number of such arrests is declining.
 There were no cases of forced exile in 1994. Six Chileans convicted of politically
 motivated crimes during the military regime opted to go abroad as a condition for
 their release from jail.
 
 
 345
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution calls for a judicial system inde-
 pendent of the other branches of government. However, the judiciary, and particu-
 larly the Supreme Court, is dominated by appointees named under the former mili-
 tary regime. Judges are appointed for life, and appointments to the appeals and su-
 preme courts are made by the President from lists preared by the Supreme Court.
 Gen. Pinochet appointed 10 of the 17 sitting Supreme Court judges, 7 of them after
 he lost the 1988 plebiscite. The judicial system is widely criticized for being out of
 date and inefficient, but the Supreme Court in the past year began working with
 the Government on broad judicial reform. Supreme Court justices sit on a blue rib-
 bon reform committee, and in November, a judicial academy was established to give
 further training to sitting judges.
 The judicial system is based on the inquisitorial system. The judiciary relies on
 the written record rather than oral testimony, and in most cases the judge renders
 a verdict after directing the investigation. The investigative phase is considered se-
 cret, with limited access for the accused or his attorney to evidence or testimony
 accumulated by the judge. There is a well-developed (but very slow), multistage ap-
 peal process leading ultimately to the Supreme Court; it is not uncommon for cases
 to linger for sevralyears.
 Under the military government a broad interpretation of state security laws ex-
 panded the jurisdiction of military courts over proscribed political activities and
 crimes committed with firearms. A 1991 legal reform package, the 'Cumplido" laws
 limited the jurisdiction of military tribunals to cases involving military officers and
 transferred most terrorist and human rights cases to the civilian courts. This re-
 opened many human rights cases previously closed by the military courts. However,
 when formal charges are filed against a military officer, including Carabineros, the
 military prosecutor asks, and the Supreme Court normally grants, jurisdiction to
 the military (see Section 1.a.).
 The Auditor General of the Army sits as a visiting justice in Supreme Court
 chambers that hear appeals of rulings from the military courts. The military courts
 often preempt full investigation of human rights cases by seeking jurisdiction and
 then dismissing the cases. For example, the Supreme Court gave a civilian judge
 jurisdiction over the 1974 disappearance of the Andronico brothers, both members
 of the MIR. She investigated the case for more than 2 years and found enough proof
 to issue an arrest warrant for active-duty Army Lt. Col. Fernando Laureani, a
 former DINA squad leader. After the arrest warrant was issued, the Supreme Court
 ganted a military court jurisdiction and the military judge closed the case in less
 an 24 hours, citing lack of evidence. Although a military court of appeals ordered
 the case reopened in May and left standing the original arrest warrant, in Septem-
 ber the military court applied the amnesty without ever calling Lt. Col. Laureani
 to testify. Human rights lawyers appealed to the Supreme Court and asked that the
 military judge be reprimanded. The Supreme Court had not ruled on the request
 by year's end.
 When President Aylwin took office in 1990, the Social Aid Foundation of the
 Christian Churches (FASIC) reported 350 prisoners in jail charged with violating
 state security laws for politically motivated crimes committed during the military
 regime. They have all been released. President Aylwin granted presidential pardons
 to 151 prisoners, 32 of whom agreed to remain outside Chile for the remainder of
 their sentences. FASIC now counts one detainee as a political prisoner because he
 was arrested after 1990 for a crime committed during the military regime. CODEPU
 says there are seven.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution prohibits searches of the home and interception of private communica-
 tions, unless either a civilian or military court issues a search warrant for specific
 locations. The 1984 antiterrorist law allows court supervised surveillance of those
 suspected of terrorist mrimes, and for the interception, opening, orrecording of pri-
 vate communications and documents in such cases. Privacy laws do not permit the
 release of telephone records nor the use of caller identification services.
 Since the return to civilian rule, there have been a number of incidents involving
 supposed espionage. In a 1992 political eavesdropping scandal, it was clear that an
 army unit was recording cellular telephone conversations of political leaders of all
 persuasions, including members of Congress. While it is against stated government
 policy to engage in this kind of political espionage, it is not clear whether or not
 it continues.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech
 and the press, and the authorities generally respected these rights in practice. The
 
 
 346
 press maintains its independence, criticizes the government, and covers issues sen-
 sitive to the military, including human rights issues.
 Military courts still assert their authority to cha  and  civilians for defama-
 tion of military personnel and sedition, but their rulings can be appealed to the Su-
 preme Court. In April a military prosecutor charged Hector Salazar, the lawyer for
 victim s' families in the 1985 murder of three Communist Party members, with sedi-
 tion. In an interview after the sentencing of the Carabineros, Salazar had ques-
 tioned whether Carabineros would obey Gen. Stange's orders when others under his
 command had just received life sentences. A military court ordered Salazar's arrest
 and *ailed him overnight before he could make bail. On appeal, the two civilian
 mem    rs of the milit   court of appeals voted to drop the  rs while the three
 military members upheld them. In August the Supreme Court ruled that Salazar's
 statement did not constitute sedition, and the military court of appeals dismissed
 charges against him. However, on December 30 the Third Chamber of the Supreme
 Court authorized the military prosecutor to file new charges.
 In November former Navy Captain Huberto Palamara was sentenced by a naval
 court to 6 years' imprisonment for disobedience. He wrote a book, "Ethics and the
 Intelligence Services," that the court had ordered confiscated in 1993. He appealed
 the sentence and remains free on bail.
 The Supreme Court was at the center of another controversy over press freedom.
 The Communist Party newspaper El Siglo printed an article in 1993 critical of the
 Supreme Court, and the court s prosecutor filed charges for offending the judiciary
 under state security laws. The editor of El Siglo and a journalist spent 15 days in
 jail, and then were released on bail. In January 1994, a court sentenced them to
 300 days' imprisonment, but freed them on bail while they appeal. Human rights
 lawyers questioned whether the lower courts could issue an impartial ruling in this
 case.
 The Government revised a draft press law that had been proposed by the Aylwin
 Government in 1993, and resubmitted the bill in September. Like the original ver-
 sion, the new bill would transfer cases involving freedom of speech for nonmilitary
 personnel from military to civilian courts, including charges of defamation and sedi-
 tion. Although Congress continues to debate the law, it remains the subject of con-
 siderable controversy with press organs arguing that it may affect freedom of ex-
 pression and the protection of anonymous sources.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-Citizens have the right to
 peaceful assembly and association. The law requires official permission to hold ral-
 lies and demonstrations on streets and public plazas. The authorities normally au-
 thorize demonstrations, but may suggest an alternative location to minimize incon-
 venience to the public. Prior to September 11, the anniversary of the coup, the Frei
 administration asked Santiago authorities not to authorize demonstrations near La
 Moneda presidential palace, the site where most of the fighting took place on the
 day of the coup and where former President Allende died. The governor of greater
 Santiago had promised the organizers of an anticoup demonstration that they would
 be able to march past the palace, and he resigned when he felt his authority to au-
 thorize such marches was not being respected.
 c. Freedom of Religon.-The Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the
 Government respects this right in practice. All denominations practice their faiths
 without restriction.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.--Chileans by law are free to move within and to enter and leave their
 country. The National Office of Returnees-established by the Con&rss in 1990 to
 facilitate the reincrporation into society of the more than 56,000 Chileans who re-
 turned from exile-closed in August. It assisted returnees and their families by pro-
 viding special access to customs exemptions, health care, housing, and information
 on job opportunities.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Chile is a constitutional democracy, and citizens have the right to change their
 government through periodic elections. There is universal suffrage for citizens 18
 years of age or over, and more than 95 percent of those eligible are registered to
 vote. Voting is compulsory for those who register. National elections for President
 and Congress were held on December 11, 1993, the second since the return to de-
 mocracy. President Frei won the largest majority in modern Chilean history, captur-
 ing 58 percent of the vote in a six-candidate race. The Senate includes 18 members
 elected in 1993 and 20 elected in 1989. Under the 1980 Constitution, various na-
 tional institutions including the President, the Supreme Court, and the Armed
 Forces-dominated National Security Council, appointed an additional nine Senators
 
 
 347
 to 8-year terms prior to the transition to democracy. (One of the appointed Senate
 positions was vacant at year's end.) While the governing coalition has a majority
 m the Chamber of Deputies, the opposition has a working majority in the Senate
 due to the eight appointed Senators.
 The former military government wrote the 1980 Constitution and amended it
 slightly in 1989 after losing a referendum for President Pinochet to stay in office.
 It provides for a strong presidency and a legislative branch with limited powers. The
 President has the authority to limit spending and to set time limits for Congress
 to consider bills. In addition, the Constitution includes provisions designed to pro-
 tect the interests of the military and the minority political opposition, currently the
 right. These provisions, according to their defenders (and even some critics) assured
 stability in the political process during the transition. The center-left coalition that
 has governed Chile since 1990 accepts the legitimacy of the 1980 Constitution, but
 has sought to amend elements characterized as "authoritarian enclaves" left over
 from the previous regime. These include limitations on the President's right to re-
 move chiefs of the armed forces, an electoral system that gives the political opposi-
 tion a disproportionate representation in Congress, and the existence of nonelicted
 "institutional senators."
 Women have had the right to vote in municipal elections since 1934 and in na-
 tional elections since 1949, and they are active m  Chilean political life at the grass
 roots level. Women make up a majority of the registered voters and of those who
 actually cast ballots, but there are few women in leadership positions. There are 9
 women among the 120 deputies, 3 women among the 46 Senators, and 3 female cab-
 inet ministers.
 Chile's indigenous people have the legal right to participate freely in the political
 process, although relatively few are politically active. While their participation has
 increased since the 1990 democratic transition, of the nearly one million self-de-
 scribed indigenous people in Chile, there is only one representative of Indian de-
 scent in the Congress. indigenous leaders participated in drafting 1993 legislation
 giving them greater influence over decisions affecting their interests.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The Social Aid Foundation of the Christian Churches hired many of the lawyers
 and assumed the bulk of the caseload of the Catholic Church's former Vicariate of
 Solidarity. The Chilean Human Rights Commission is affiliated with the Inter-
 national League of Human Rights and continues to gather evidence of police abuses.
 The Defense Committee of the Peoples' Rights (CODEPU) provides legal counsel to
 those accused of politically related crimes and to victims of human rights abuses.
 Nongovernmental organizations (NGO's) say that the Government has cooperated
 with their efforts to investigate accusations of continued human rights violations in
 Chile. Many international NGO's also continued to follow closely human rights is-
 sues in Chile.
 The National Commission on Truth and Reconciliation issued a report in 1991
 that was a catalytic event in allowing Chilean society to come to terms with human
 rights abuses under the military government. The successor to the Commission, the
 National Corporation for Compensation and Reconciliation continues to investigate
 cases, and the Congress recently extended its mandate through the end of 1995 to
 allow it to complete investigations of the last of 3,200 individual cases of human
 rights abuses on which it has information. The corporation also provides more than
 one million dollars per month in compensation to more than 5,000 family members
 of human rights victims.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution guarantees equality before the law, but it does not specifically
 ban discrimination based on race, sex, religion, or social status.
 There are no laws preventing gays or lesbians from exercising freedom of speech
 or other rights. However, when the National Health Service advertisements on
 AIDS awareness suggested homosexual behavior was one of the situations that put
 people at risk, two local television stations refused to run the advertisements.
 Women.-Legal distinctions between the sexes still exist, despite a decision in
 1989 to ratify the U.N. Convention to Eliminate All Forms of Discrimination
 Against Women, and give human rights treaties precedence over local laws. A law
 that classified adultery as a criminal offense for women and a civil offense for men
 was changed in 1994. The law permits legal separation, but not divorce, so those
 who wish to remarry need to seek annulments. Since annulments imply that the
 marriage legally never existed, former wives are left with little legal recourse for
 
 
 348
 financial support. A law was recently enacted that creates conjugal property as an
 option in a marriage but some women actually saw this as a step backward since
 the law on separate property (which still exists), gives women the right to half their
 husbands' assets but gives husbands no rights to theirs.
 The public is only be gi  to become aware of the extent of abuses such as wife
 beating. The National Women's Service (SERNAM), created in 1991 to combat dis-
 crimination against women, found in a survey that 26.2 percent of women said they
 had been subjected to some form of physi  violence by their husband or partner
 and another 33.5 percent reported some form of  ychological violence, but only 16
 percent reported such violence to the police. SERNAM is now conducting courses on
 the legal, medical, and psychological aspects of domestic violence for Carabineros,
 who are usually the first public officials to intervene in such incidents, and in Janu-
 ary, the Carabineros created a Family Affairs Unit.
 The Congress recently enacted a law on intrafamily violence that provides court-
 ordered counseling to those involved in intrafamily violence. In the first 5 months
 it was in effect, nearly 1,000 cases were reported to the Carabineros family affairs
 unit in Santiago. In 57 of those cases, men claimed they were abused by their
 spouses. Carabieros also reported that the family affairs unit received more than
 2,400 complaints of rape or sexual abuse the first 11 months that it was in oper-
 ation.
 Another SERNAM study of female heads of household found that on avera  they
 earn 45 percent as much as male heads of households. Women with no schooling
 received a salary that was 82 percent of that of their male counterparts without
 schooling, while women heads of household with university training earned only
 51.7 .ercent as much as their male contemporaries. SERNAM has a pilot program
 providing occupational training and child care to attempt to alleviate this form of
 discrimination.
 Children.-The Congress enacted a law that segregates juvenile offenders from
 adult prisoners. Although juvenile offenders (Le. those under 18) had long received
 special treatment in the courts, some of the prisoners had been incarcerated with
 adults. The National Minors Service (SENANE) conducted a survey that indicated
 sexual abuse of minors occurred but that few cases were reported. The new law on
 intrafamily violence was designed in part to deal with this type of problem. A Unit-
 ed Nations Children's Fund study of 1,853 young people attempted to estimate how
 many children work. The study concluded that 7 percent of children between 6 and
 17 years of age were in the work force. The majority of the working minors were
 males from single parent families who work more than 40 hours per week and did
 not attend school. The Congress is considering a proposed law to regulate, rather
 than ban, work by minors so that there would be a better chance of their attending
 school.
 Indigenous People.-The Mapuches from southern Chile comprise over 90 percent
 of the indigenous population, but there are small Aimara, Atacameno, Huilliche,
 Rapa Nui, and Kawaskhar populations in other parts of Chile. A committee com-
 posed of representatives of indigenous goups participated in drafting the 1993 law
 that recogzed the ethnic diversity of the ingenous population and gave them a
 voice in decisions affecting their lands, cultures and traditions. It provides for even-
 tual bilingual education in schools with indigenous populations, and replaced a stat-
 ute which emphasized assimilation of indigenous people. However, out of the popu-
 lation which identifies itself as indigenous (nearly one million, according to the 1992
 census), about half remain separated from the rest of society, largely because of his-
 torical, cultural, educational, and geographical factors, and in fact the ability of in-
 digenous people to participate in decisions affecting their lands, cultures, traditions,
 and the allocation of natural resources is marginal at best.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minoritie--Chile assimilated a maor European (mainly
 erman) migration in the last century and a major Middle Eastern (mainly Arab)
 migration in the early part of this century. Smaller racial and ethnic minority
 groups experience a degree of intolerance. The wife of a prominent Korean resident
 fied suit after she was banned from a local health clu , and the Supreme Court
 ruled in her favor, assessing the maximum fine.
 People With Disabilities.-Congress passed a law in 1994 to promote the integra-
 tion of people with disabilities into society, and the National Fund for the Handi-
 capped (FONDIS) has a $1.5 million budget. The 1992 Census found that 288,000
 citizens said they had some form of disability, but FONDIS estimates that the ac-
 tual number is closer to one million. The disabled still suffer some forms of legal
 discrimination, for example, blind people cannot become teachers or tutors. Al-
 though the law now requires that new public buildings provide access for the dis-
 abled, the public transportation system does not make provision for wheelchair ac-

 cess, and even a new subway line under construction has barriers to the disabled.
 Reserved parking for the disabled is becoming more common.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Workers have a right to form unions without prior
 authorization and to join existing unions, and about 11.5 percent of the work force
 is organized. A newly enacted law gives government employees' associations the
 same rights as trade unions, and the associations' leaders are on committees to
 draft the implementing regulations. Public employee associations participate in
 labor centrals, but they had not enjoyed the same legal protection as unions. Only
 the police and military are not allowed to form unions.
 The 1992 Labor Code permits nationwide labor centrals, and the Unified Workers
 Central (CUT) the largest and most representative central, legalized its status in
 April 1992. CT and many other confederations and federations maintain ties to
 international labor organizations. Unions are independent of the Government, but
 union leaders are usually elected from lists based on party affiliation and they
 maintain ties to their parties.
 Reforms to the Labor Code in 1990 removed significant restrictions on the right
 to strike. For example, employers may no longer fire striking workers without pay-
 ing severance benefts. But the law continues to require that workers vote by secret
 ballot in the presence of a labor inspector or notary whether to accept the company's
 final offer before they can go on strike. Employers must now show cause to fire
 workers, but "needs of the company" is a permissible cause. Union leaders claim
 that some employers invoke this clause to fire employees who are attempting to
 form unions or who are active in collective bargainng.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Although the climate for col-
 lective bargaining improved under the democratic government, most workers con-
 tinue to negotiate individual contracts. Employers say this is due to the emphasis
 that workers put on individual performance, but union leaders say that the Labor
 Code prevents many sectors from organizing. The process for negotiating a formal
 labor contract is carefully regulated, and the Labor Code prescribes a detailed set
 of rules for contract negotiations. Formal negotiations are required for unions to call
 a strike. Nonetheless, the law permits (and the government encourages) informal
 union-management discussions to reach collective agreements ("convenios") outside
 the regulated bargaining process.
 Employers may include a clause in individual employment contracts that some
 classes of employees are not allowed to participate in collective bargaining. While
 this supposedly applies only to supervisory personnel, in the telephone company, for
 example, technical personnel also have such contracts.
 Temporary workers--defined in the Labor Code as agriculture, construction, port
 workers, and entertainers-may now form unions, but their right to collective bar-
 gaining continued to be restricted. The Laebr Code provides sanctions for unfair
 bargaining practices that protect workers from  dismissal durn   the bargaining
 process, butlabor leaders claim that companies invoke the "needs of the enterprise
 clause to fire workers after a union has signed a new contract, particularly when
 negotiations result in a prolonged strike. If a worker proves in court that he had
 been fired unfairly, this will raise his severance pay by 20 percent, but he will not
 get his job back. Since workers must wait months or years or the court to rule be-
 fore col ecting their severance pay, they seldom resort to this remedy.
 The same labor laws apply in Chile's duty free zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulory Labor.-The Constitution and the Labor
 Code prohibit forced or compulsory labor, and there is no indication that it is cur-
 rentlay practied.
 d Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The law permits children as young
 as 14 years old to be employed only with permission of parents or guardians, after
 completing their compulsory elementary schooling, and in restricted types of labor.
 Those aged 15 to 18 may be employed in a larger variety of jobs and at expanded
 hours, but only with their parents' or guardians' permission. Labor inspectors en-
 force these regulations and voluntary compliance is good in the formal sector. Many
 children are employed in the informal economy, however, which is more difficult to
 regulate (see Section 5 on children). The Carabineros have procedures to counsel
 parents who take their children out of school and put them to work.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The law sets minimum wages, hours of work,
 and occupational safety and health standards. The legal workweek is 48 hours
 which can be worked in either 5 or 6 days. The maximum workday length is 10
 hours but a few positions like caretakers are exempted. A tripartite committee com-
 prised of government, employer, and labor representatives normally suggests a min-
 imum wage based on projected future inflation and increases in productivity, but in
 
 
 1994 the employers did not participate and the labor representatives did not accept
 the Government's final offer. The Congress passed the Government's proposal with
 little dissent, which set the minimum monthly wage at about $125 (51,125 pesos).
 Lower paid workers also receive a family subsidy to help raise their earnings to an
 acceptable level.
 Ministry of Labor inspectors enforce laws covering working conditions. The Gov-
 ernment has increased resources and targeted inspections at industries that had
 been the worst abusers. As a result, enforcement is improving and voluntarily com-
 pliance is fairly good. Insurance mutuals have provided workmen's compensation
 and occupational safety training for the private sector since the 1960's and they re-
 ported a 24 percent decline in occupational injuries over that time although 11 per-
 cent of the work force still submitted claims. In November the Congress amended
 the law to allow public sector workers the same coverage, a longstanding demand
 of organized labor. Workers who remove themselves from situations that endanger
 their health and safety have their employment protected provided they asked a
 workers' delegate to bring the problem to the attention of labor inspectors.
