 URUGUAY
 Uruquay ended 12 years of military rule on March 1, 1985, when
 it resumed its traditional status as a democracy with a freely
 elected executive branch, independent bicameral legislature,
 and an autonomous judicial branch. Political life since the
 return to democratic rule has continued to be marked by a high
 level of political participation by all sectors of the
 population and by a vigorous and unrestricted political debate
 on the nation's problems. The Parliament, in which President
 Julio Maria Sanguinetti's Colorado Party holds a plurality,
 has resumed its former role in the nation's political life.
 The judicial branch has regained its independence, and there
 is an ongoing public debate over the need for various reforms
 in the legal and judicial systems. Nongovernmental
 institutions--such as political parties, the press, labor
 unions, and private interest groups--operate freely and
 without restriction by the Government.
 Uruguay recovered slightly from the effects of a prolonged
 economic recession, and its economy showed modest growth in
 1986, although inflation continued to be a problem. It
 remains one of the more advanced developing countries, with a
 complex social security and social welfare system. The
 Government is placing increasing emphasis on the private
 sector, although state enterprises monopolize key sectors, and
 the Government controls prices on some basic items.
 There were no credible complaints of human rights violations
 in 1986, but public debate continued over how to deal with
 military and police personnel accused of human rights
 violations before and during the military regime. All former
 political prisoners, including those convicted of crimes of
 violence as well as some nonpolitical criminals, were
 amnestied in 1985. One sector of opinion, supported by the
 Government, argued that, in the interests of putting the
 country's past behind it, amnesty should also be extended to
 accused military and police figures.
 A bill introduced by the Colorado Party reflecting this view
 was rejected by the Parliament in September, as was a more
 stringent Blanco Party draft which would have provided for
 some categories of prosecutions. Following a December 1
 meeting of the President, the military, and the political
 parties, the military high command issued a statement
 reaffirming its support for democratic government. The
 statement admitted that some excesses may have occurred during
 the military's tenure in government, but expressed the opinion
 that members of the military should not be held responsible
 for acts committed under orders. Subsequent discussions led
 to parliamentary approval of a bill which was signed into law
 by the President on December 22.
 The new law excluded any future prosecutions against military
 and police personnel for alleged crimes committed under orders
 during the military regime, except for offenses committed for
 economic gain. The law assigns to the executive the
 responsibility to determine if cases already before the courts
 are covered by its provisions; if so, the cases are considered
 to be closed. The law also directs the executive to
 investigate the fate both of those who disappeared following
 arrest and of children presumed kidnaped when their parents
 were arrested, and to report the results of its investigation
 to complainants within 120 days.

 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There were no cases of political killings reported.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no cases of disappearance reported. However, local
 human rights groups stated that 10 to 20 persons may have
 disappeared during the period 1978-84.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 No credible reports of torture or deliberately inhuman
 treatment were reported. There were isolated reports of
 individuals who'claimed to have been mistreated by police, but
 none of these allegations was substantiated. In at least one
 case the accusations were determined to be fraudulent. Local
 human rights groups continued to press their concerns about
 overcrowding and adverse living conditions in Uruguayan
 prisons.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 No cases of arbitrary arrest, detention, or exile were
 reported.
 Uruguay's 1967 Constitution requires a written warrant for
 arrest unless the accused is apprehended in the act of
 committing a crime. The Constitution provides the right to a
 judicial determination of the legality of detention in which
 the-detaining authority must explain and justify the legal
 grounds for the detention. It also stipulates that a prisoner
 has the right to counsel and the right to give a statement
 before a.judge within 24 hours of detention. The judge must
 begin the judicial process within 48 hours of arrest. In
 criminal trials which could result in a penitentiary sentence,
 bond is allowed. The death penalty and brutal treatment in
 prisons are both prohibited by the Constitution, which
 specifies that prisons shall be used only for rehabilitation
 and reeducation. Military justice can be applied to civilians
 only during a state of war or insurrection. These
 constitutional safeguards are now in force and are generally
 respected. Forced or compulsory labor does not exist.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Full autonomy of the judiciary was restored in 1985, and
 military officers who had been appointed by the military regime
 to the Supreme Court or the higher Appeals Court retired from
 their posts. The law provides, however, for two military
 justices on the Supreme Court to participate in cases involving
 the military. According to the Constitution, all trials must
 be public. Each trial must be opened by a public statement of
 the charge by a prosecutor or complainant. Uruguayan legal
 tradition calls for judges to hand down decisions on the basis
 of written summaries, which are not available to the public.
 
 
 646
 URUGUAY
 A parallel military court system exists under the military
 justice code. The Parliament will consider revisions to the
 code in the future.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Constitution affirms the inviolability of the home, which
 is absolute at night and may be entered and searched only with
 a legal warrant during the day. Private papers and
 correspondence are likewise inviolable unless a legal warrant
 has been obtained. These rights are respected. The state-run
 telecommunications monopoly is investigating alleged cases of
 wiretapping during the military regime. There was no credible
 evidence that this practice continued after March 1985.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Freedom of speech and press is protected by the Constitution.
 Newspapers and magazines are published by all sectors of
 political opinion, including formerly proscribed organizations
 such as the Communist Party and the Tupamaro movement which
 conducted campaigns of terrorism in the late 1960's and early
 1970's. Criticism of the Government is tolerated. Academic
 freedom and university autonomy are respected. The student
 union reestablished itself and held elections in 1985.
 Elections for university authorities were also held in that
 year. Most professors who were fired by the military regime
 for ideological reasons have returned to their positions; the
 cases of others are being studied. The mass firings of
 professors who were appointed during the mi-litary regime
 raised objections among rightwing groups and the professors
 affected.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Freedom of assembly and association are protected by law.
 Formerly banned groups such as the Tupamaros are free to
 organize and disseminate their opinions. A permit is required
 for public marches and demonstrations, obtainable from the
 Ministry of the Interior, but such demonstrations occur
 without official harassment or intimidation. Citizenship
 rights denied to some individuals by the military regime on
 the basis of political affiliation and activity have been
 fully restored.
 The Constitution guarantees the right of workers to organize
 freely and encourages the formation of both unions and
 arbitration boards. The Interunion Workers Assembly and
 National Workers Association which represent most Uruguayan
 unions have resumed activity since the return to democracy.
 Both in law and in practice, workers have the right to strike
 and bargain collectively. The Government supports these rights
 and supports legislation that would prohibit the firing of
 workers for union activity; it promotes collective bargaining
 in which government, management, and labor participate through
 salary councils for various sectors of the work force.
 Trade and professional organizations which wish to participate
 in the general labor movement may do so. All are free to join
 international bodies. At present Uruguayan labor is not
 affiliated to any of the international labor federations.

 URUGUAY
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Religious freedom is constitutionally guaranteed and respected.
 Although most Uruguayans are Catholic, missionaries from other
 religious groups are not hindered in the exercise of their
 calling.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 There are no restrictions on internal or foreign travel or
 emigration. An estimated 300,000 Uruguayans left the country,
 voluntarily or otherwise, during the military regime.
 Notwithstanding the fact that many left for economic rather
 than political reasons, a parliamentary commission on
 repatriation is considering ways.to aid and encourage those
 who wish to return. All prominent political figures exiled by
 the military regime have-returned to the country.
 Section.3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Uruguay is-amultiparty democracy, with mandatory universal
 suffrage for those 18 years of age and older. There are no
 voting restrictions based on race, sex, religion, or economic
 status. The country's major political parties--the Colorado
 Party, the Blanco (National), Party.and the leftist Broad Front
 coalition--have kept their cohesion by allowing each
 ideological group within the party to field its own slate of
 candidates. -National and provincial elections are held
 simultaneously every 5 years; the next one is scheduled for
 November 1989. There are no women members of the current
 Parliament, but several serve as alternates.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitudes Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights   --
 Since the return to democratic rule in 1985, Uruguay has not
 been a major focus of concern for internationally based human
 rights organizations. The Government is open to such
 organizations and does not restrict the activities of human
 rights investigators. The most prominent local human rights
 group is SERPAJ (Peace and Justice Service), a
 nondenominational organization supported by several religious
 bodies and affiliated with similar groups throughout South
 America. Legalized in early 1985 after operating underground
 during the last 2 years of the military regime, SERPAJ now
 investigates both nonpolitical human rights issues such as
 prison conditions, and politically controversial cases
 involving death, torture, and disappearance which occurred
 during the military regime. The Foro Juvenil (Youth Forum),
 which operated openly throughout the last years of military
 rule, carries out research on problems encountered by women,
 youth, and minorities in Uruguay. Several professional human
 rights committees have investigated members accused of
 complicity in human rights violations during the military
 regime. Committees of the Uruguayan legislature also are
 investigating specific cases of human rights violations.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Uruguay has long been one of the most egalitarian countries in
 Latin America, with a well-developed welfare system. Racial
 
 
 48
 URUGUAY
 or linguistic minorities are statistically few in Uruguay.
 While nonwhites are disproportionately represented at the
 lower end of the economic scale, they are not victims of
 legislated discrimination.
 Women in Uruguay have complete equality before the law. They
 attend the national university and pursue professional careers
 in large numbers. Women serve in the Cabinet, the courts, and
 the diplomatic corps at the ambassadorial level. Some barriers
 to equality still exist as the result of traditional social
 patterns and restricted employment opportunities. Pay is not
 always equal for men and women, especially for less skilled
 workers in the private sector.
 CONDITIONS OF LABOR
 For many decades Uruguay has been one of the most advanced
 countries in Latin America in terms of worker rights. Child
 labor is not permitted by law until the child has obtained a
 primary education. Children are generally not employed below
 the age of 15, but children of 12 or above can work with
 special permits from the government. Dangerous, fatiguing, or
 night work, apart from domestic service, cannot be performed
 by children under 18, and hours and pay are more strictly
 regulated than for adults. Children 16 years of age or over
 can sue in court for payment of wages, and the right of child
 laborers to dispose of their own wages is mandated by law.
 Children working in the informal sector-street vendors,
 itinerant laborers and others with no fixed place of
 operation--or in agrarian work generally are less strictly
 regulated and are lower paid. For adults, the norm is an
 8-hour day and 48-hour week.
 After 1 year of service, workers are entitled to 10 paid days
 of vacation, which increases with additional years of service.
 Wages must include a Christmas bonus in addition to paid
 vacation. Workers are at least theoretically protected by
 minimum wage legislation and laws regulating the health and
 safety of working conditions.
