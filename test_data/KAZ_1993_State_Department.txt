 KAZAKHSTAN
 In its second year of independence, the Government of Kazakhst.an continued po-
 litical and economic reform while stressing political consensus and interethnic har-
 mony. The Supreme Soviet (Parliament) adopted a new Constitution which rein-
 forces legal guarantees for basic political and personal freedoms, further removing
 Kazakhstan from the legacy of Soviet rule. The new Constitution establishes the ex-
 ecutive as the predominant branch of government. President Nursultan Nazarbyev,
 elected in 1991 in a single-candidate election, is the leading political figure in the
 country. The Supreme Soviet and the judiciary, while generally supportive but not
 yet fully independent of the executive, proved to be more effective checks on execu-
 tive power than in 1992. The Supreme Soviet, elected in 1990 under the Soviet sys-
 tem, lacked a democratic mandate. In an effort to speed the reform process, the Su-
 preme Soviet voted in December to move the date of the next parliamentary elec-
 tions hum December 1994 to March 7, 1994, dissolve the Supreme Soviet, and grant
 the President extraordinary power to rule the country until the new supreme soviet
 is sworn in. The new legislature will be comprised of 135 deputies elected from dis-
 tricts and 42 appointed by the President. The President's power to appoint deputies
 has sparked controversy.
 The Committee for National Security (KNB) is seeking to legitimize its role by fo-
 cusing more on issues of nuclear proliferation, counterterrorism, and combating or-
 ganized crime and official corruption. In many respects, however, it is a continu-
 ation of the old Soviet Committee for State Security, or KGB. It retains, for in-
 stance, the authority to deny citizens permission to travel in and out of the country,
 to requisition property, and to demand cooperation by citizens (e.g., to inform on
 other citizens). Declining real wages for the criminal police, which is subordinated
 to the Ministry of Internal Affairs, resulted in increased corruption.
 The Government in 1993 accelerated the pace of economic reform, while trying to
 minimize social dislocation and political and ethnic tensions. Kazakhstan began a
 World Bank-approved program of privatization. A small private sector is growing
 and is relatively free to operate, although hampered by bureaucratic holdovers from
 the Soviet era. The economy continued its decline in 1993, Nith near hyperinflation
 and a budget deficit of about one-tenth of gross domestic product. However, ts edu-
 cated, pragmatic people and vast natural resources form a solid basis for long-term
 economic growth.
 Basic human rights were generally respected in 1993, although there were signi-
 cant problems in a number of areas. The most egregious human ri;ghts abuse was
 the effort by the Government and state-sponsored trade unions to harass and sup-
 press independent trade unions and impose other restrictions on worker rights. A
 widely voiced complaint was that good laws were being passed at the national level,
 but implementation of them at the local level was weak. A huge bureaucracy, in-
 cluding state enterprises, stifled initiative and reduceci openness. Freedom of assem-
 bly and religion were generally respected. Internal freedom of movement was re-
 stricted by continued use of the "propiska" system of permits for residence in tht
 capital. With the important exception of state television, the media were increas-
 ingly pluralistic and more frequently critical of the Government. However, continu-
 ing state ownership of printing and broadcasting facilities had an inhibiting effect
 on pyess freedom.
 
 
 Ethnic Kazakhs predominate in government and, at times, discriminated against
 non-Kazakhs, in part out of a sense of a need for affirmative action to reverse dec-
 ades of second-class status under the Tsarist and Soviet empires. Some ethnic
 Kazakhs pressed for election laws that would give preferential treatment to
 Kazakhs. In the interests of interethnic harmony, the Government refused to reg-
 ister political parties that, it claimed, were based on ethnic or religious criteria. The
 Government expressed concern over contacts between foreign embassies and non-
 governmental organizations (NGO's) and opposition parties and independent trade
 unions and moved to restrict the activities of foreign NG ds.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-No political or other extrajudicial
 killings are known to have occurred.
 b. Disappearance.-No political disappearances or abductions are known to have
 occurred.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Torture is prohibited by law, and no cases of torture or inhuman or degrading treat-
 ment or punishment are known to have occurred. Prison conditions are deteriorating
 due to overcrowding, resulting from the increase in crime during 1993. The budget
 for prisons has not kept pace. Cells are packed to overflowing, and the diet is inad-
 equate. There is not enough equipment and electricity to provide work for the pris-
 oners. Prisoners are allowed one visit every 6 months. Additional visits may be
 granted in emergency situations. Juveniles are kept in separate facilities.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-With    only  minor modifications,
 Kazakhstan continued to use the Soviet legal system in 1993. The new Constitution
 lays the basis for reform of the legal system. Pretrial detention is sanctioned by law.
 Prosecutors issue arrest warrants. According to the Criminal Procedure Code, a de-
 tainee may be held for 3 days before being charged. Ater 3 days, the detainee may
 be held with the sanction ota prosecutor ut no longer than 10 days without being
 charged. The detainee may be held up to 1 year before trial. Detainees are not held
 incc;.ununicado. Defendants in criminal cases have the right to choose an attorney
 and to appeal the legality of their arrest to the prosecutor before trial. If the defend-
 ant cannot afford an attorney, the State wil" provide one free of charge. There is
 no provision for bail. Defendants remain incarcerated until trial. Some lawyers fear
 reprisals if they represent a client unpopular with the Government.
 There were reliable reports of some violations in law enforcement procedures, in-
 cluding arrests without specific charges, detentions of persons for more than 10 days
 without bringing charges, and instances of refusing access to a lawyer. In many
 cases, citizens and the police appeared to be uninformed about the right of the ac-
 cused to have access to a lawyer or the legal necessity of a specific charge within
 a certain time frame.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-In Kazakhstan's court system, the President rec-
 ommends nominees for the Supreme Court for Supreme Soviet approval. Heads of
 oblasts (provinces) recommend nominees for oblast soviet (council) approval. Re-
 gional or city councils elect lower level judges. All judges are appointed for 10-year
 terms. The Constitutional Court, established in 1992, interprets the Constitution,
 resolves legal conflicts between oblasts, and rules on interethnic problems.
 Kazakhstan law provides for due process, including the right to a public trial, the
 right to counsel, the right to call witnesses for the defense, and the right to appeal
 a decision to a higher court.
 There are three levels in the court system: the local level, the oblast level, and
 the Supreme Court. Local-level courts handle less serious crimes, such as  tt theft
 and vandalism (hooliganism, in the old terminology). Oblast-level courts handle the
 more serious crimes, such as murder, grand theft, and organized criminal activities.
 The oblast courts may handle cases in rural areas where no local courts are orga-
 nized. Judgments of the local courts may be appealed to the oblast-level courts.
 Judgments of the oblast courts may be appealed to the Supreme Court. A special
 arbitration court handles disputes between state enterprises.
 In 1993 the Constitutional Court continued to show its ability to act independ-
 ently by declaring a number of decrees unconstitutional. During the debate over the
 Constitution, attempts from some quarters to limit substantially the powers of the
 Constitutional Court were voted down.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 KNB and the Ministry of the Interior, with the sanction of the Procuracy, may arbi-
 trarily interfere with privacy, family, home, and correspondence, a legacy of Soviet
 rule. Criminal police, who remain part of the internal security structure, are re-
 
 
 936
 quired by law to have a search warrant from a prosecutor before conducting a
 search but were sometimes known to conduct searches without a warrant. There
 were also credible reports that police occasionally planted evidence.
 The KNB has the right to monitor telephone calls and mail, but under the law
 it must inform the Procuracy within 3 days of such activity.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The new Constitution provides for freedom of
 speech and press. Kazakhstan has an increasingly pluralistic press and generally
 respects freedom of speech. However, laws against insulting the President and Su-
 preme Soviet deputies and a government monopoly on broadcast media and printing
 presses act to limit these freedoms.
 Kazakhstan has hundreds of publications and radio and television companies,
 both governmental and private. Because of the slow progress of privatization, the"
 Government continued to control printing, distribution, and broadcast facilities and
 subsidized "official" as well as most "independent" publications. Government owner-
 ship of printing and broadcast facilities tended to encourage self-censorship. For
 budgetary reasons, the Ministry of Press and Mass Information planned to reduce
 subsidies further to nonofficial publications.
 Most political opposition groups issue their own publications, which, though de-
 pendent on government control of printing supplies, are critical of government poli-
 cies. In general, the opposition press was not subject to intimidation or harassment.
 One exception was Birlesu, the. independent trade union publication, which the
 Almaty city administration harassed in various ways (e.g., denial of paper and other
 printing supplies). In addition, Russian print journalists were prevented from trans-
 mitting reports to Moscow after Russian television broadcast a story on May 22
 about the tensions between ethnic Russians living in Kazakhstan and Kazakhs.
 Official publications also increasingly criticized Supreme Soviet and presidential
 decisions. Overall, self-censorship appeared to decline in 1993. The prohibition
 against insulting the President or Supreme Soviet deputies however, remained in
 force. Karishal Asanov, tried and found not guilty in 1992 ofIthe charge of insulting
 the President, was retried in 1993. The prosecutor appealed the 1992 not-guilty ver-
 dict, and the Supreme Court, finding technical problems with the first trial, ordered
 a retrial. Asanov was found guilty and was sentenced to 3 years' probation. He ap-
 ealed the judgment and was awarded another trial Asanov was acquitted in Octo-
 r of the charge of insulting the President. There were no reports of the Govern-
 ment refusing to allow an academic to publish for political reasons.
 Despite Kazakhstan's generally positive record on media freedom in 1993, several
 other cases pointed to continuing problems. In January 1992, the terms of employ-
 ment for heads of local television and radio broadcasting enterprises with country-
 wide Kazteleradio were changed from a system in which they were employed under
 the labor law to a contract system. This was done without the knowledge of the re-
 gonal employees and made it easier for them to be fired. In January 1993,
 Kazeleradio decided not to renew the contract of Bakhidzhan Mukushev, the head
 of Karaganda radio. This decision was widely ascribed to political reasons.
 Mukushev was a reformer who supported the Independent Miners Union of
 Karaganda. Also, Kazteleradio insisted that the majority of radio programming in
 Karaganda, a majority Russian-speaking area, be in Kazakh. Mukushev, an ethnic
 Kazakh, argued for a more gradual approach. Radio employees who struck in sym-
 pathy with Mukushev won the Government's agreement to settle the matter in
 court. The case was taken to both the Constitutional Court and the local oblast
 court. The Constitutional Court, ruling on the legality of the contract system under
 which Mukushev was hired rather than on Mukushev's personal case, decided in
 Mukushev's favor. The oblast court, nonetheless, ruled against Mukushev under
 pressure, many believe, from oblast authorities. Mukushev is awaiting trial in the
 Supreme Court.
 Independent television station Tvin reported erroneously in its morning news pro-
 gram 'relemax" that the chairman of Turan Bank, the former state industrial bank
 had been arrested for stealing. Telemax caught the mistake within 10 minutes and
 issued an apology. However, the chairman of Turan bank sued Tvin for 15 million
 rubles for defamation, an amount that would have bankrupted the station. The
 Almaty city court awarded only 1 million rubles in damages The Procuracy has ap-
 pealed to the Supreme Court for the full 15 million rubres. The Procuracy's action
 was widely perceived as an attempt to close down Tvin and its radio component
 radio Max, stations considered liberal and proreform. The Procuracy has the right
 to appeal the decision of a civil case if it believes the law was not properly followed
 in the conduct of the trial.
 
 
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 freedom of assembly and association, which in 1993 were generally respected. Dem-
 onstrations must have the approval of local authorities 10 days in advance. Those
 held without prior approval are considered illegal. The organizers may be tried and
 given jail sentences. There were no illegal demonstrations resulting in punishment
 during 1993.
 To participate in elections a political party must register with the Government.
 To register, a party must submit a list of at least 3,000 members from a minimum
 of 11 (out of 19) different oblasts (provinces). The list must provide personal infor-
 mation about the members, including date and place of birth, address, and place of
 employment. For many Kazakhstanis, submitting such personal data to the Govern-
 ment recalls old-style KGB tactics and inhibits them from joining parties. The na-
 tionalist, pan-Turkic Alash party and the Social Democratic Party refused to reg-
 ister on the principle that they should not have to submit personal information
 about their members to the Government. Members of unregistered parties may run
 for elected office as individuals but not as party members.
 Organizations or "movements" that conduct public activity, hold public meetings,
 participate in conferences, or hold bank accounts must also register with the Gov.
 ernment. A minimum of 10 members is required to register on the local level, and
 a minimum of 10 members in at least 11 oblasts is required to register on the re-
 public level. The Government's refusal to register religious and ethnic-based parties
 and movements is not a stated policy, although some officials quote article 55 of the
 Constitution which states: "The creation and activity of public associations proclaim-
 ing or carrying out in practice racist, nationalist, social, or religious intolerance,
 elitist exclusivity. . . is prohibited."
 Government officials have justified decisions not to register certain parties on the
 grounds that the activities of ethnic-based parties and movements could spark eth-
 nic violence, if allowed to operate freely. Unregistered parties and movements are,
 nonetheless, able to hold meetings and publish newspapers, although these groups
 appear to have more difficulty obtaining paper and ink than other publishers.
 The only group that actually ap lie5 for registration and was refused (in 1992)
 was the ethnic Russian Yedinstvo (Unity) movement. It was refused on the grounds
 that it opposed the use of Kazakh as the state language and wanted to form para-
 military units to "assist" the police. Two other political groups, Azat and Alash,
 have objected to the requirement that they submit personal data about their mem-
 bership when registering.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-Freedom of religion is provided for in the Constitution
 and is respected. Kazakhstan is a relatively secular society. Muslims, Christians,
 Jews, and members of other religions reported no interference from the Government
 or any other source. The Mufti and the Orthodox Archbishop appeared together pub-
 licly to promote religious and ethnic harmony.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-Freedom of movement within Kazakhstan was generally respected.
 However, although privatization of housing proceeded in 1993, the Government still
 controlled most housing and required a residence permit (propiska). Obtaining a
 propiska was generally routine in 1993, with the exception of the capital, Almaty.
 Since 1992, the city administration has limited the transfer of residences in Almaty
 to people already living there. There is favoritism toward ethnic Kazakhs in the
 transfer of residences. For example, the Almaty city administration is more likely
 to give permission to sell or trade a residence if a Kazakh is to receive the property.
 An exit visa is still required for travel abroad, but refusals in 1993 were excep-
 tional. Some officials, however, reportedly demanded bribes for issuing one. In one
 reported case, an exit visa was refused on political grounds. Bakhidzhan Mukushev,
 who had led a strike of radio workers in Karaganda (see Section 2.a.), was invited
 to attend a seminar sponsored by the American Federation of Labor-Congress of In-
 dustrial Organizations (AFL-CIO) in the United States. Of the three government
 agencies authorized to issue exit visas, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry
 of Internal Affairs, and the local oblast authority, none would issue a visa to
 Mukushev, each telling him it was the responsibility of one of the other two agen-
 cies. Mukushev took his case to the Supreme Court and eventually received his visa,
 but only after it was too late to attend the seminar.
 The Government accords special treatment to those Kazakhs and their families
 who fled Kazakhstan during Stalin's time and wish to move back to Kazakhstan.
 Kazakhs in this category are encouraged to return to Kazakhstan, are entitled to
 citizenship, and may retain any other citizenship they already have. Anyone else,
 including ethnic Kazakhs who are not considered refugees from Stalin's terror, such
 as the descendants of Kazakhs who moved to Mongolia during the previous century,
 must apply for permission to immigrate and must renounce any other citizenship.
 
 
 938
 Ethnic Kazakh citizens already living in Kazakhstan, as well as nonethnic Kazakh
 citizens, are not permitted to obtain another citizenship without losing their
 Kazakhstani citizenship.
 The Constitution provides for the right to emigrate, and it is respected in practice.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The right of citizens to effect a peaceful, democratic change in their government
 is untested. To speed the reform process, the Supreme Soviet voted on December
 8 to move the date of the next Supreme Soviet elections and oblast-level elections
 up from December 1994 to March 7, 1994. Kazakhstan's first presidential election
 is expected to be held in December 1995. All men and women aged 18 and above
 have the right to vote.
 Shortly before independence, President Nazarbayev won election as the first
 President of the country. He ran unopposed in the election and received 98 percent
 of the vote. While Nazarbayev appeared to have broad support, no international
 monitors were invited to verify that the vote was free and fair. The leader of the
 Zheltoksan Party, who attempted to run against Nazarbayev, alleged that the Gov-
 ernment used a series of legal technicalities, as well as force, to prevent him from
 fulfilling the requirements to establish his candidacy.
 Supreme Soviet deputies were elected in March 1990 while the Communist Party
 retained a monopoly on political power. The Supreme Soviet lacked democratic legit-
 imacy. Nonetheless, it represented a growing, if still modest, check on the Presi-
 dent s power. Although it usually supported the President, in 1993 it successfully
 opposed a number of presidential initiatives. Most of its sessions were open to the
 press and foreign ambassadors. Members of the Kazakhstani public couldbe invited
 by deputies to attend sessions and give speeches on a particular area of expertise,
 but the sessions were not generally open to the Kazakhstani public.
 There are two legally registered  poitical parties: the Sociaist Party (the former
 Communist Party); and the Peoples Congress Party (formed by poet and environ-
 mentalist Olzhas Suleymenov).
 President Nazarbayev is not a member of any party but has accepted the formal
 endorsement of the People's Unity Movement. There are a number of unregistered
 opposition parties and movements. The Government has refused to register any
 party or movement whose platform it believes will foment ethnic tensions (see Sec-
 tion 2.b.).
 There are no legal restrictions on women participating in politics and government,
 but, owing to prejudice and traditional attitudes, few women are professionally ac-
 tive in these fields. About 5 percent of Supreme Soviet deputies are women.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 There are a number of local human rights organizations active in Kazakhstan.
 The Government did not interfere with the activities of the local Helsinki Watch
 group. The latter had limited organizational and financial means to observe, contest,
 and report human rights violations. It did protest such actions as the retrial of
 Karishal Asanov (Section 2.a.). Members of the Supreme Soviet's human rights com-
 mittee supported the establishment and registration of the Kazakhstan-America
 Human Rights Association. The Association, funded with the assistance of the
 Union of Councils of Soviet Jews, cooperated with Helsinki Watch and other
 Kazakhstani organizations.
 The Government permitted representatives of the Free Trade Union Institute
 (FTUI), the AFL-CIO    the International Republican Institute (IRI), the National
 Democratic Institute (NDI), ISAR (a gup that assists in the development of envi-
 ronmental organizations), human rights groups, and foreign constitutional lawyers
 to visit Kazakhstan and contact opposition and environmentalist groups. However,
 in midyear the Government ordered the NDI and IRI to suspend their activities
 until they were formally registered with the Ministry of Justice. Kazakhstan's law
 currently has no provision for registering foreign nongovernmental organizations
 (NGO's). Government officials stated that other foreign NGYs are allowed to oper-
 ate despite their lack of registration because they are not working with opposition
 political parties. At various times during 1993, the Government interfered with the
 IRr's,NDI's, and ISAR's telephone and facsimile (fax) communications.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 Women.-There is no legal discrimination against women, but women are severely
 underrepresented in higher positions in government and state enterprises and over-
 
 
 represented in low-paying and some menial jobs. Women are disadvantaged in pro-
 motions, but they genera y have access to higher education.
 Several women s organizations exist, including   the Union of Women      of
 Kazakhstan, the Union of Women Entrepreneurs, the League of Muslim Women,
 and the Union of Feminists, which is headed by a man. There are also mothers'
 groups organized around specific issues, including the Mothers of Soldiers, Mothers
 of Invalido, and Mothers of Many Children. The major concerns of most women's
 groups are to obtain support for families during the economic crisis and to increase
 the number of women in government and business. The women's groups generally
 supported the Government and avoided partisan politics.
 Accrdng to reliable local observers, wife beating is common, particularly because
 of widespread alcohol abuse among men. Police are reluctant to intervene unless
 the believe the beating is severe or life threatening. The maximum sentence for
 wife beating is 3 years.
 Children.-aThe Government is committed in principle to children's rights and has
 signed the U.N. Convention on children's rights (it has not yet been raified by the
 Supreme Soviet). As in many other areas, tl'e absence of a tradition of civil liberties
 and budget stringencies severely limit the Government's effectiveness in dealing
 with children's rights issues. There is no established pattern of governmental or so-
 cietal abuse against children. According to credible reports, child labor is used dur-
 ing harvests, particularly during the cotton harvest in the south (Section 6.d.).
 Article 51 of the Constitution states: "he upkeep, teaching, and upbringing of
 children is the obligation of the parents or persons substituting for them. The na-
 ture and forms of      n    and education should not damage the interests of the
 child." Article 52 states: "The State provides for the upkeep, upbringing, and edu-
 cation of orphaned children and children deprived of parental care, and encourages
 charity toward children."
 National /Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-Kazakhstan's population of about 17 million
 is comprised of about 43 percent Kazakhs; 37 percent Russians; 7 percent other
 Slavs, mainly Ukrainians; and smaller populations of Germans, Uzbeks, Tatars,
 Uyghurs, Koreans, and scores of other ethnic groups. Many Slavs and Germans
 have emigrated to the West or to the countries of their national origin in the hope
 of better economic opportunity and, in some cases, for fear of eventual discrimina-
 tion by ethnic Kazakhs in an independent Kazakhstan.
 There was increasing discrimination in favor of ethnic Kazakhs in employment in
 government and state-controlled enterprises as well as in education, housing, and
 other areas. Although some officials are Slavs, ethnic Kazakhs increasingly predomi-
 nated in government and in higher positions in state enterprises. The Supreme So-
 yet had 360 deputies of whom only 80 were not ethnic Kazakhs. The Constitution
 provides for equal pofital l rights .or all citizens regardless of ethnicity. President
 Narbayev has     publicly emphasized that all nationalities are welcome in
 Kazakhstan, but most non-Kazakhs are nervous about preferences for ethnic
 Kazakhs and discrimination against those who do not speak the Kazakh language.
 Many ethnic Kazakhs, however, believe they were second-class citizens under Rus-
 sian domination for 200years and tiiat action is needed to reverse this. Under Com-
 munist rule, Kazakh and other minority languages and cultures were repressed.
 The majority of the population speaks Russian; only about half of ethnic Kazakhs
 can speak Kazakh effectively. The Supreme Soviet declared in January that Kazakh
 would be the official state language, that Russian would be the "language of
 interethnic communication," and that there would be a "transition period" (the dura-
 tion of which was left undefined) for the majority of the population to learn Kazakh.
 The Government is encouraging more education of children in the Kazakh language
 but has done little to provide Kazakh-language education for adults. There are re-
 ports of ethnic Kazakh gangs in rural areas targeting ethnic Russians for theft, and
 reports of more frequent exchanges of insults between Russians and Kazakhs in
 public p aces. However, there ar. no reports of politically organized ethnic violence
 between Russians and Kazakhs.
 People with Disabilities.-According to the Constitution citizens with disabilities
 are entitled to assistance from the State. As a result of inflation, people relying only
 on state disability benefits experience severe economic hardship. There is no legal
 discrimination against people with disabilities, but in practice employers do not give
 them equal consideration. The Government has not legislated or otherwise man-
 dated accessibility for the disabled.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Supreme Soviet adopted a new Labor Code dur-
 ing its spring session which, along with the Constitution, provides for basic workers'
 rights, including the right to organize and the right to strike. The law does not,
 
 
 940
 
 however, provide mechanisms to protect workers who join independent unions from
 threats and harassment from the state-run unions or from enterprise management.
 Kazakhstan joined the International Labor Organization (ILO) in 1993.
 Most workers remained members of the system of state-sponsored trade unions
 established during the Communist period. Membership was obligatory. At the vast
 majority of enterprises, the state-spnsored unions continued automatically to de-
 duct 1 percent of each worker's salary as dues. In addition, 30.2 percent of each
 worker's salary was withheld for the government pension fund, and 7.3 percent was
 taken by the state unions, which have the authority to allocate funds for disability
 and sick pay, housing, and the use of vacation retreats. The state-run unions under
 the Communist system were, and in most respects still are, an organ of the Govern-
 ment. They often use their power coercively to enforce labor discipline and work
 hand in hand with government and management to minimize labor unrest and to
 discourage workers from forming or joining independent unions.
 The Constitution entitles workers to join or form unions of their own choosing and
 to stop the automatic dues deductions for the state unions. To obtain legal status,
 an independent union must apply for registration with the local judicial authority
 at the oblast level and with the Ministry of Justice at the repubhc level. Registra-
 tion is generally a lengthy, difficult, and, especially for smaller unions, expensive
 process. The decision to register a union appears to be arbitrary, with no published
 criteria. Judicial authorities and the Ministry of Justice have the authority to cancel
 a union's registration.
 Workers who joined independent trade unions were subjected to various forms of
 harassment, including dismissal, transfer to lower paying or lower status jobs,
 threats, and intimidation. State unions often took an active part in the harassment
 to inhibit challenges to their hegemony and to pressure new unions.
 Independent unions suffered in 1993 as a result of the lack of enforcement of na-
 tional laws at local levels. For example, in Tekele, a group of miners left the state-
 sponsored union to form an independent union. After 7 months, dues were still
 being deducted automatically from their salaries for the state union. The miners
 took the case to the oblast court. The judge told them to go to the state union and,
 in effect, "to work it out," leaving them at the mercy of the state union. The miners
 then took the case to the Supreme Court, where it remained pending at year's end.
 The Independent Trade Union Center of Kazakhstan claims that membership in
 independent unions has nonetheless doubled from 250,000 in 1992 to 500,000 in
 1993, out of a total work force of about 5,600,000.
 Unions have the legal right to strike, and several major strikes occurred in 1993.
 In January the Karaganda radio workers went on strike to protest the removal of
 Karaganda radio director Bakhidzhan Mukushev for what they perceived to be polit-
 ical reasons. The radio workers received support from the Independent Coal Miners
 Union (NPG) and others in solidarity. The strike lasted several weeks but failed to
 achieve Mukushev's reinstatement.
 A major cause of labor unrest in 1993 was the payment of part of, or all, wages
 at some enterprises in scrip rather than in cash, a practice at odds with Article 3
 of ILO Convention 95 on the protection of wages, which prohibits payment of wages
 other than in the legal currency without the expressed consent of the workers. En-
 terprise directors claimed that the enterprises were not being paid in cash by their
 traditional trading partners in other parts of the former Soviet Union, which were
 also experiencing cash flow difficulties as a result of the general economic crisis. The
 scrip was often not accepted at stores or accepted at a discount in its value. In
 Kentau, some 15,000 miners went on strike in May after not being paid full wages
 in cash since February. The enterprise agreed to pay the wages in full, although
 as of December most miners were receiving about 20 percent or less of their normal
 salaries. When paid, the miners' salaries are usually well above the minimum wage.
 In 1992 the NPG of Karaganda won the right for the miners to market privately
 15 percent of the coal they produced. In 1993 enterprise and oblast authorities used
 bureaucratic obstacles to limit the miners' ability to market their 15 percent.
 By law, unions may freely join federations or confederations and affiliate with
 international bodies. Most independent trade unions in Kazakhstan belong to the
 Independent Trade Union Center (ITUC) headquartered in Almaty. The NPG, along
 with the State Miners' Union of Karaganda, became members of the Miners' Inter-
 national Federation.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-There are significant limits
 on the right to organize and bargain collectively. Most industry is state owned and
 is subject to the State's production orders. Although collective bargaining rights are
 not spelled out in the law, in some instances unions have successfully negotiated
 agreements with management. If a union's demands are not acceptable to manage-
 ment, they may be presented to an arbitration commission comprised of manage-
 
 
 ment, union officials, and independent technical experts. There is no law against
 antiunion discrimination.
 There are no export processing zones. Several free economic zones enjoy all the
 privileges of export processing zones, as well as other tax privileges and abatements,
 but labor conditions in them appear to be no different from those elsewhere in
 Kazakhstan.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced labor is prohibited by law.
 Compulsory labor, however, is used to gather the annual grain harvest. Some per-
 sons were required to provide labor or the use of privately owned equipment, with
 no or very low compensation, to help gather the harvest on state-owned farms. Uni-
 versity-level students were also required to help with the harvest at minimal com-
 pensation.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The minimum age for employment
 is 16. A child under age 16 may work only with the permission of the local adminis-
 tration and the trade union in the enterprise at which the child would work. Such
 permission is rarely granted. Abuse of child labor was generally not a problem, ex-
 cept that child labor was used during the harvest, especially the cotton harvest in
 the south.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-There is no universal minimum wage that cov-
 ers all employment sectors. The current economic crisis with its high inflation rate
 has made implementing and enforcing a meaningful minimum wage difficult. In its
 October session, the Supreme Soviet set a new minimum wage rate of about $7 per
 month, which is not sufficient for a worker and family to live on.
 The legal maximum workweek is 48 hours, although most enterprises maintain
 a 40-hour workweek, with a 24-hour rest period.
 Working and safety conditions in Kazakhstan's industry are substandard. For ex-
 ample, workers in factories usually do not wear protective clothing, such as goggles
 and hard hats, and work in conditions of poor visibility and ventilation. Economic
 dislocation is a major cause of shortages of safety equipment. The regulations con-
 cerning occupational health and safety, enforceable by the Ministry of Labor and the
 state-sponsored unions, are largely ignored by management and not enforced. Lack
 of management concern, as well as economic dislocation, has resulted in shortages
 of safety equipment. Workers, including miners, have no jegal right to remove them-
 selves from dangerous work situations without jeopardy to continued employment.
