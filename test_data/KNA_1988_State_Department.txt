 ST. KITTS AND NEVIS
 St. Kitts and Nevis is a small two-island state with a
 parliamentary democracy modeled after that of the United
 Kingdom. The Constitution provides the smaller island of
 Nevis considerable self-government, as well as the right to
 secede from the federation if certain enumerated procedures
 are followed.
 The country is governed by a prime minister, a cabinet, and a
 legislative assembly. The Governor General, with largely
 ceremonial duties, is the titular Head of State. The
 Constitution requires general elections at least every 5
 years. Prime Minister Kennedy Simmonds and his People's
 Action Party came to power in a coalition government in 1980
 and attained a parliamentary majority in 1984.
 Security forces consist of a small police force, which
 includes a Special Service Unit that receives some light
 infantry training, and a small coast guard.
 St. Kitts and Nevis has a mixed economy based on sugar cane
 and tourism. Most commercial enterprises are privately owned,
 but the sugar industry (the country's largest) and 85 percent
 of all arable land are owned by a state corporation. The
 approximate 1986 per capita income was $1,476. Steady
 economic growth continued in 1988.
 St. Kitts and Nevis maintained its good human rights record
 during 1988.

 opposition political party.

 elections in which all citizens 18 years of age and older may
