 MONGOLIA*
 The Mongolian People's Republic is a rigidly controlled
 Communist state. Only the Mongolian Communist party, the
 Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party (MPRP), is permitted to
 function. The leadership of the country is vested in a
 10-person Politburo of the MPRP Central Committee headed by
 Jambyn Batmonh. Nominally, the People's Great Hural, or
 National Assembly, enacts the basic laws of the country. It
 meets for 3 days once each year. Between sessions, the
 Council of Ministers (Cabinet), appointed by the Hural, issues
 current legislation.
 The Soviet Union dominates Mongolia politically and
 economically. The Mongolian State is modeled on the Soviet
 system, and MPRP Leaders travel often to Moscow for
 consultations. The Soviets guarantee their influence by
 stationing approximately five combat divisions on Mongolian
 soil. As in the political arena, Mongolian economic life is
 shaped by the Soviet bloc: 95 percent of Mongolia's foreign
 trade is conducted with the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe.
 Soviet involvement in the Mongolian economy is largely
 exploitative, particularly in the area of mining and mineral
 exporting. The Mongolian economy remains heavily agricultural,
 with an emphasis on liveanimals and animal products.
 Little information is available concerning government control
 or treatment of Mongolian citizens. There are no known
 domestic opposition groups, and emigre groups are small. Much
 of what information is available comes from the Mongolian
 regime. The few resident diplomats and occasional visitors to
 Mongolia are mainly limited to the capital city
 (Ulaanbaatar). Travel to other parts of the country is
 restricted.
 It is known, however, that Mongolian life and society are
 highly regimented. Few Mongolians are authorized to travel
 outside the Soviet bloc countries. Political opposition to
 the ruling Communist party is not permitted. Freedoms
 guaranteed to the individual under the Mongolian Constitution,
 including speech, demonstration, and assembly, can be
 exercised only to "strengthen the socialist state system." In
 effect, individual civil and political liberties do not exist,
 and this situation is unlikely to change in the foreseeable
 future.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section I Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There is no information available concerning political killing
 by the Government.
 b. Disappearance
 There is no reliable information available concerning
 disappearance in Mongolia. High government officials
 *The United States has never recognized nor has it had
 diplomatic relations with the Mongolian People's Republic.
 The absence of normal channels of intercourse makes it more
 difficult to comment authoritatively on conditions in that
 country.

 occasionally disappear from public view, and no information is
 released concerning their subsequent fate.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 No information is available concerning this subject,
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 There is no information available on this question.
 Information is also unavailable as to whether forced or
 compulsory labor is prohibited or practiced.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Current civil and criminal codes stipulate the right of the
 accused to judicial process, a legal defense, and public trial
 "except as stipulated by law." Closed proceedings are
 permitted in the case of crimes against the State. As the
 civil code places a heavy emphasis on this category of crimes,
 and because the MPRP controls all legal systems, those accused
 of such crimes are unlikely to receive a fair trial.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The right to privacy of person, home, and correspondence is
 guaranteed in the Constitution, but there is no information
 available concerning the application of these rights by
 Mongolian authorities. Travel, as well as job and residence
 changes, are decided in accordance with economic needs as
 determined by the State.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution provides for freedom of speech but specifies
 that the exercise of individual rights must be to "strengthen
 the socialist state system." Actions which the party deems
 not to be in accord with this definition would likely result
 in arrest and detention. Criticism of the Government is not
 tolerated. Control is exercised through various government
 organizations, notably the People's Control Organization,
 which extends down to the neighborhood committee level. The
 press is state-owned and heavily restricted by the
 Government. It serves primarily as a propaganda tool.
 Non-Communist foreign media representatives generally are not
 allowed into the country. Academic and artistic life is also
 tightly controlled in accordance with government policy.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Freedom of demonstration and assembly are guaranteed by the
 Constitution, but in practice only government-authorized
 organizations may assemble, and the only demonstrations
 allowed are carefully orchestrated by government authorities.
 The Constitution gives workers the right to organize
 professional and trade unions, but all are controlled and
 directed by the Government to promote its policies.

 MONGOLIA
 While the Labor Law does not mention specifically collective
 bargaining, it does provide for settlement of labor grievances
 by "Commissions for Labor Disputes" formed by local trade
 union councils and people's courts, and composed of equal
 numbers of trade union council representatives and enterprise
 managers. There is no information on how this works in
 practice.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Freedom of religion exists in theory, but the current regime
 strictly controls religious activity through an Office of
 Religious Affairs attached to the Council of Ministers.
 Religion no longer plays any significant part in the lives of
 most Mongolians. The Buddhist religon, which was a central
 force in Mongolian life prior to the establishment of the
 Communist Government, has been reduced to a few showcase
 monasteries and a handful of monks. They serve primarily as
 propagandists and as showpieces for tourists. Religious
 figures do not hold high positions in government.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Until recent years, few Mongolians traveled abroad, even to
 the Soviet Union. Foreign travel usually has been permitted
 only for official purposes, but government-sponsored education
 abroad has become increasingly common. As many as 40,000
 Mongolian youth go to the Soviet Union yearly for short
 training programs. Almost all travel abroad remains
 restricted to Soviet bloc countries." No Mongolians are known
 to have requested repatriation to Mongolia. There is no known
 routine emigration from Mongolia.
 All Mongolians over age 16 must have internal passports and
 must obtain permission from the Security Bureau in order to
 travel within the country. Attempts to change jobs or
 residences must be approved by both the Security Bureau and
 the People's Control Organization.
 Although the 1978 Constitution guarantees the right "to reside
 in the territory of the MPR" to foreign citizens, Mongolian
 authorities in 1983 began a systematic expulsion of ethnic
 Chinese. Many of the between 6,000 and 7,000 ethnic Chinese
 in Mongolia were evidently offered a choice between
 resettlement in the barren northern part of the country or
 expulsion to China. The Mongolian authorities claimed the
 expellees had no formal occupation and/or did not abide by
 Mongolian law, despite the fact many of them had been living
 and working in Mongolia since the 1950's.
 By late September 1983, over 2,000 Chinese had returned by
 train to the People's Republic of China. Many of the
 expellees were reported to have been stripped of their
 personal property by the Mongolian customs authorities before
 being allowed to cross the Chinese border.
 The expulsions continued in 1984, though apparently at a
 reduced rate. Some estimates place the number of Chinese who
 left Mongolia in 1984 at approximately 1,000. If these
 estimates are correct, then nearly half of the Chinese
 population has been forced to leave the country by the
 authorities. The Government is reportedly now permitting
 Chinese to leave on a less onerous basis, without confiscation
 
 
 835
 MONGOLIA
 of their possessions, yet the authorities appear determined to
 expel or widely disperse the remaining Chinese.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 The MPRP does not tolerate political groups outside of its
 control. It is established on the Soviet model, with a narrow
 pyramid of power topped by Party General Secretary Batmonh.
 Batmonh reached the top by replacing former leader Yumjaagiyn
 Tsedenbal at a Central Committee meeting called while
 Tsedenbal vacationed in the Soviet Union. Tsedenbal had been
 in power for 40 years. Both Soviet and Mongolian press
 reports stated that Tsedenbal relinquished power voluntarily.
 Nothing has been heard of him since August 1984, when the
 Government announced the shakeup.
 Lower-ranking members of the MPRP have no real ability to
 influence the decisions of their superiors. Elections are
 held at regular intervals, but only one candidate is listed
 for each office, so the choice is to vote for him or cross his
 name out. Many elections result in a 99.9 percent turnout.
 Winning candidates regularly receive 99.9 percent of the
 vote. While there is no officially espoused policy of
 minority disenfranchisement, there is no evidence of religious
 persons occupying elite party or government positions, and
 only a few members of minorities do so.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Mongolia acceded to the United Nations Covenant on Civil and
 Political Rights in 1976. However, the Mongolian regime has
 consistently followed the Soviet human rights policy and
 practice, whether or not it is consistent with the Covenant.
 There have been no known opportunities for outside
 investigators to examine human rights practices. It is highly
 unlikely that Mongolian officials would permit such
 investigation by any outside authority or organization. There
 in no known organization dedicated to the protection of human
 rights in Mongolia. The Amnesty International 1985 Report
 does not contain an entry for Mongolia. Freedom House rated
 it "not free."
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 According to the World Bank, Mongolia's population of 1.9
 million grew at a rate of 2.6 percent in 1985. Mongolian
 statistics state that 76 percent of the population is under 35
 years of age. The Mongolians have patterned their economy on
 the Soviet model with resource allocation controlled rigidly
 by the central authorities. The majority of the population is
 still engaged in agriculture, primarily herding. Gross
 national product per capita in 1979, the latest year for which
 statistics are available, was $780.00. There is no
 information available on inflation rates, unemployment, or
 underemployment.
 World Bank and Mongolian Government statistics tend to confirm
 Mongolian claims of some improvement in the standard of
 living. Mongolian government figures indicate that there were
 23.3 physicians per 10,000 population in 1983 and that the
 infant mortality rate had declined to 46.4 per 1,000 live
 
 
 836
 MONGOLIA
 births in 1985. Life expectancy at birth rose from 52 years
 in 1960 to 65.6 years in 1985. According to the World Bank,
 the percentage of calories available for consumption relative
 to nutritional needs reached III percent in 1982.
 Despite the substantial rise in the Mongolian standard of
 living over the last 50 years, the country remains extremely
 backward. National economic growth is severely limited by an
 inefficient and overcentralized bureaucracy and a
 centrally-run economy subordinated to the Council for Mutual
 Economic Assistance, a Soviet-dominated organization. These
 combine with a lack of resources, extreme geographic
 isolation, and a severe climate to keep the quality of
 Mongolian life poor by international standards.
 Education has been a high priority since the mid-1950's.
 According to Mongolian government statistics, the total number
 of students per 10,000 persons increased from 1,375 in 1960 to
 2,723 in 1983. There appears to be little sex, racial, or
 religious discrimination in education. World Bank figures for
 1982 show the adjusted primary school enrollment ratio for
 females as being almost the same as for males. The seventh
 5-year plan (1981-85) continues to encourage the learning of
 the Russian language in the Mongolian educational system. The
 Government claims universal literacy.
 The Mongolian Labor Law sets a minimum work age and maximum
 work hours for all workers, and exhorts state enterprises to
 observe work safety requirements. Children under 16 are not
 permitted to work, although 15-year-olds may work if allowed
 to by the local trade union committee. Those under 18 are
 prohibited from doing arduous work or to work in dangerous
 areas such as mining. The workday for adults is 8 hours; for
 those aged 16 to 18 it is 7 hours, and for those aged 15 it is
 6 hours. Information on wage rates is not available.
 Universal franchise and equal rights for women are official
 policy, and according to Mongolian government statistics, the
 proportion of women in the work force rose from 30 to 46
 percent between 1960 and 1980. While few women occupy
 positions of responsibility in the Government or party, it is
 reported that they do hold high professional positions in
 institutions such as hospitals. The Mongolian Women's
 Committee is the only known organization devoted to women's
 interests. It is controlled by the MPRP, and its aims are
 unknown.
