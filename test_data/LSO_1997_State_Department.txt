 LESOTHO
 Lesotho is a constitutional monarchy. Prime Minister Ntsu Mokhehle of the Leso-
 tho Congress for Democracy (LCD) party is the head of government and exercises
 executive authority. In 1993 Mokhehle, then leader of the Bastholand Congress
 Party (BCP), won free and fair multi-party general elections that resulted in BCP
 control of the Government and the bicameral Parliament. In June a schism in the
 BCP's ranks led Mokhehle to abandon the party he formed in 1952 and establish
 the new Lesotho Congress for Democracy (LCD) Party. He took a majority of the
 members of the BCP with him, giving the LCD a 40-seat majority in the 65 member
 House of Assembly. The BCP was relegated to minority opposition status, with only
 23 seats.
 The BCP refused to accept its opposition status. Beginning in August, BCP mem-
 bers refused to regularly attend parliamentary sessions and tried to make the coun-
 try ungovernable, as opposition parties in the House of Assembly and the appointed
 33-member Senate chose not to cooperate with the new LCD. Despite the fact that
 the LCD Government was formed in a constitutional manner, the opposition claims
 that the LCD is illegitimate and lacks the moral authority to rule because it never
 received an electoral mandate. Under the 1993 Constitution, the King is a ceremo-
 nial monarch with no executive authority and is proscribed from taking political ini-
 tiatives. In 1994 King Letsie III, in collaboration with elements of the army, staged
 a palace coup, unconstitutionally suspended Parliament and installed an appointed
 Ruling Council. However, domestic and international pressures led to a rapid return
 of constitutional government. The judiciary appears subject at times to Government
 and chieftainship influence.
 The security forces consist of the Lesotho Defense Force (LDF), the Royal Lesotho
 Mounted Police (RLMP), and the National Security Service (NSS). The Government
 adopted legislation that brought these services under more direct civilian control.
 The LDF now answers to the Prime Minister, through the Ministry of Defense. The
 NSS is directly accountable to the Prime Minister, and the RLMP reports to the
 
 
 Minister of Home Affairs. Members of the security forces on occasion committed
 human rights abuses.
 Lesotho is a landlocked country surrounded by South Africa, and is almost en-
 tirely dependent on its sole neighbor for trade, finance, employment, and access to
 the outside world. A large proportion of the adult male work force is employed in
 the mines in South Africa; miners' remittances account for slightly over one-third
 of gross national product (GNP). Real GNP was projected by the Ministry of Plan-
 ning to grow at a rate of 5.5 percent during 1997, with inflation estimated at below
 9 percent at year-end. Per capita GNP was approximately $790. State-owned organi-
 zations predominate in the agro-industrial and agri-business sectors, but private
 sector activity dominates in the small manufacturing and construction sectors.
 Under the traditional chieftainship system, the vast majority of land, particularly
 in the interior, is owned by the Crown, and managed in trust by traditional chiefs
 who control land tenure and land use rights. Limited long-term (99-year) leasehold
 rights for land exist for farmers, householders and enterprises, but is still legally
 viewed as belonging to the King.
 The Government generally respected the human rights of citizens; however, there
 continued to be problems in some areas. Police occasionally used excessive force
 against suspects in custody. Discipline in the security services improved somewhat,
 but a few controversial disturbances still occurred. A police mutiny in February re-
 flected entrenched mistrust and competition between the Government and some ele-
 ments within the police force, and an uneasy institutional relationship between ele-
 ments of the police and the army. It was sparked by the Government's only attempt
 to prosecute anyone for extrajudicial killings or other abuses committed in the con-
 flicts of 1994 through 1996. As a result of their involvement in that mutiny, 33
 members of the RLMP face sedition and high treason charges. The noninvolvement
 of the LDF in the police mutiny is a mark of progress in its evolution away from
 partisan politics toward a more professional and cooperative pattern of civil/military
 relations. In fact, the Army was called on to forcibly quell the police mutiny. Prison
 conditions are poor. The Government did not prosecute any one for extrajudicial
 killings or other abuses committed in the conflicts of 1994 through 1996. For exam-
 ple, palace guards who opened fire on demonstrators during the 1994 palace coup
 were given blanket amnesty as well as were the members of the coup's provisional
 government; and, also in 1994 the Deputy Prime Minister chaired a commission of
 inquiry for the incident in which the former Deputy Prime Minister was shot and
 killed allegedly by soldiers, but the results were not made public and there is no
 indication that military or law enforcement officials or palace guards were pros-
 ecuted for their involvement in incidents leading to these deaths. The security serv-
 ices reportedly monitor telephones illegally. Women's rights continued to be severely
 restricted, and domestic violence remained common. Government enforcement of
 prohibitions against child labor is lax in commercial enterprises involving hazardous
 conditions. Societal discrimination against people with disabilities is common.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no confirmed reports
 that officials were involved in political or extrajudicial killings. The commission of
 inquiry and investigation that looked into the September 1996 incident in which po-
 lice opened fire on striking construction workers did not result in any prosecution
 or disciplinary action against the police involved.
 The Government did not successfully prosecute anyone for extrajudicial killings
 or other abuses committed in the conflicts caused by political unrest from 1994
 through 1996. The only initiative to do so was the attempt to summon eight RLMP
 police officers to appear before the magistrate court in connection with the 1995 ex-
 change of gunfire at a police station that killed three police officers. They were
 named by a commission of inquiry that concluded its work on December 1996. The
 eight officers' refusal to appear in court led to the 10-day February police mutiny,
 which was finally put down by an LDF assault on central police headquarters. At
 year's end they faced treason and sedition charges for the mutiny, but no charges
 for the 1995 killings. Palace guards who opened fire on demonstrators during the
 1994 palace coup were given blanket amnesty as were the members of the coup's
 provisional government. In 1994 the Deputy Prime Minister chaired a commission
 of inquiry into the incident in which the former Deputy Prime Minister was shot
 and killed, allegedly by soldiers, but the results were not made public. There is no
 indication that military or law enforcement officials or palace guards were pros-
 ecuted for their involvement in incidents leading to these deaths.
 
 
 177
 The authorities also failed to investigate or prosecute any security officials for the
 extrajudicial or summary killings committed during the political unrest of 1994.
 They also failed to investigate 1994 reports of police brutality, as well as pre-1994
 reports of deaths in police custody of a number of unionists and criminal suspects.
 . Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution prohibits torture or inhuman or degrading punishment or other
 treatment, and there were no reports of its use. However, there were credible re-
 ports that police officers occasionally used excessive force against criminal suspects
 in their custody. It was commonly alleged by NGO's and victims that police used
 excessive force, in the form of beatings, against criminal suspects in their custody.
 Some NGO's have alleged that police engage in acts of torture. Occasionally these
 allegations are accompanied by doctor's reports suggesting physical abuse of alleged
 victims. However, no police officer was prosecuted for suc acts during the year and
 police leaders deny that torture is practiced or is condoned as a matter of policy.
 Prison conditions are poor. Prison facilities are overcrowded and in disrepair, but
 conditions do not threaten the health or lives of inmates. Prison conditions are not
 monitored independently.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution prohibits arbitrary ar-
 rest and detention, and there were no known incidents of these abuses. However,
 police mutineers were imprisoned without charges from February through Decem-
 ber, and have yet to be tried for these charges.
 Persons detained or arrested in criminal cases and defendants in civil cases have
 the right to legal counsel. The 1981 Criminal Procedures and Evidence Act, as
 amended in 1984, makes provision for granting bail. Bail is granted regularly.
 The Government has repealed the provisions of the 1984 Internal Security Act
 (ISA) allowing for investigative detention. There is concern within the legal frater-
 nity that the police mutineers, who were arrested in February, were being held for
 a longer than usual period of time and without a trial by year's end. The delay was
 reportedly due to the fact that the prosecution had not completed its investigation.
 A member of the LDF was arrested and charged in July with sedition and treason
 for allegedly conspiring to overthrow the Government. He is being held at a maxi-
 mum security prison and his trial is still pending.
 Pretrial detainees constitute a significant portion of total prison population, up to
 one-half in some locations. Because of the case backlog, periods of pretrial remand
 can last several years.
 The Government does not use forced exile.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution provides for an independent judi-
 ciary. However magistrates appear to be subject at times to government and
 chieftainship influence.
 The judiciary consists of the court of appeal (which meets semiannually), the High
 Court, magistrate's courts, and customary or traditional courts, which exist largely
 in rural areas to administer customary law.
 The High Court also provides procedural and substantive advice and guidance on
 matters of legal procedure to military tribunals; however, it does not participate in
 arriving at judgments. Military tribunals have jurisdiction only over military cases,
 and their decisions may not be appealed. Both law and custom severely limit the
 rights of women (see Section 5), but court procedures and treatment of women are
 not blatantly discriminatory.
 Accused persons have the right to counsel and public trial. The authorities gen-
 erally respect court decisions and rulings. There is no trial by jury. Criminal trials
 are normally adjudicated by a single High Court judge who presides, with two asses-
 sors serving in an advisory capacity. In civil cases, judges normally hear cases
 alone.
 There were no reports of political prisoners. There is no system to provide public
 defenders.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-Al-
 though search warrants are usually required under normal circumstances, the ISA
 provides police with wide powers to s top and search persons and vehicles and to
 enter premises for similar purposes without a warrant. There are no prohibitions
 against monitoring telephone conversations on national security grounds and the se-
 curity services are believed to do so routinely.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech
 and of the press, and the Government generally respected these rights in practice.
 There are several independent newspapers-including one each controlled by the
 Roman Catholic and Lesotho Evangelical Churches, and two English-language
 
 
 weekly newspapers that routinely criticize the Government. The official state-owned
 media consist of one radio station, one local television channel which broadcasts
 only one 1-hour daily newscast, and two weekly newspapers, which all faithfully re-
 flect the official positions of the ruling party. There are no private radio or television
 stations.
 The Government has withdrawn all of its advertising from a local language
 (Sesotho) newspaper, which is linked to a faction of the BCP. The Government al-
 leged that the newspaper defamed members of the Cabinet. Four cabinet ministers
 filed a civil lawsuit against the newspaper, seeking compensation for the alleged
 slander and defamation. In addition, ruling party members of Parliament ques-
 tioned the newspaper's editors at length, and implicitly threatened another civil
 lawsuit. The High Court later threw out the lawsuit, and ordered the ministers con-
 cerned to cease using a government lawyer to represent them in the case, to obtain
 private legal counsel, and to refrain from using the attorney general in private mat-
 ters. The editor of the newspaper believes that these actions amounted to press har-
 assment by the Government and were an effort to censor or influence the editorial
 policy of a private news organ. It appears that this was an effort by the Government
 to intimidate and influence a newspaper editor who was critical of its policies. How-
 ever, the newspaper continues to be published and is widely read, and there have
 been no other overt attempts to close it or limit its circulation.
 In September the Speaker of Parliament took an unprecedented and controversial
 step to-ban the public and the news media from attending parliamentary sessions.
 He claimed that some members of the public, who were taking sides in partisan de-
 bates between the LCD and the BCP, were inappropriately interrupting the delib-
 erations, disturbing the decorum of the House of Assembly, and directing unaccept-
 able language toward Members of Parliament. The rules of Parliament did not allow
 the Speaker to make a distinction between members of the public and the press in
 this matter, so the speaker banned both groups from parliamentary sessions. This
 ban was lifted in December and the press and public have returned to the Par-
 liament's gallery.
 The Government fully respects academic freedom. Although the Government owns
 and administers the country's only university, the academic staff represent the full
 political spectrum and are unhindered from expressing their views.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-Under a 1993 revision of the
 ISA, a public meeting, rally, or march no longer requires prior police permission,
 only advance notification. The police and local authorities generally respected these
 rights in practice. Political party meetings and rallies occur regularly throughout
 the country.
 The Government did not investigate or prosecute any of the security personnel
 who killed and wounded several protesters at a peaceful 1994 progovernment dem-
 onstration.
 The Constitution provides for freedom of association. Although the Government
 generally respects this right in practice, in July and August the Government briefly
 banned all demonstrations at the royal palace after opposition parties marched
 there to protest to the King the formation of the LCD. The Ministry of Interior stat-
 ed that the King could not be presented with petitions personally because he had
 nb mechanism of addressing petitions outside the cabinet and the Government.
 In addition to the BCP and the Basotholand National Party (BNP), there are sev-
 eral smaller political parties.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of religion and the
 Government respects this right in practice.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-Citizens generally are able to move freely within the country and across
 national boundaries. The Government places no obstacles in the way of citizens who
 wish to emigrate.
 In 1994 the Government allowed about 25 refugees to register with the United
 Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) to study in Lesotho. They were
 expected to return to their countries of first asylum after completing their studies.
 Other than these students, Lesotho has no resident refugee population. There is no
 clear policy on first asylum or forcible return of refugees, but the Ministry of For-
 eign Affairs officials indicate that they would consult with the UNHCR in specific
 cases.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens exercised this right in 1993 in the first multiparty democratic elections
 in more than 20 years. The BCP won control of the National Assembly. Despite its
 landslide electoral victory, the BCP Government was forced to contend with a num-
 
 
 179
 her of challenges to its power in 1994. Those challenges culminated in August 1994
 when King Letsie I1, with LDF backing, exceeded his constitutional authority when
 he unconstitutionally suspended the Parliament and installed a Ruling Council.
 Many citizens responded by demonstrating their support for the democratically
 elected BCP Government. Organized labor and others held two national demonstra-
 tions--stay aways" from work-to demonstrate support for the ousted Government,
 and there were numerous rallies at the National University. As a result of both do-
 mestic and international pressure, the King reversed himself, and the BCP regained
 control of the Government.
 The 1994 memorandum of understanding between King Letsie III and Prime Min-
 ister Mokhehle-which was brokered by South Africa, Botswana, and Zimbabwe-
 called for the reinstatement of the King's father, Moshoeshoe II, who had been de-
 os~ed by the previous military government and exiled in 1990; as well as steps to
 roaden the political process. The 1994 suspension of the Constitution by King
 Letsie III, although short-lived, highlighted the fragility of constitutional rule. In
 early 1995, Moshoeshoe II was reinstated as King. However, King Letsie III was
 again sworn in as King in January 1996, upon the death of his father. The formal
 coronation of King Letsie III was held on October 31.
 Preparations are underway for the second consecutive national multiparty elec-
 tions, which are scheduled for April and May, 1998.
 There are no legal impediments to women's participation in government or poli-
 tics, but women remained underrepresented. There are 2 women in the 65-member
 House of Assembly and 7 women in the 33-member Senate. Both the Minister of
 Transportation and Communication and the Deputy Speaker of the House of Assem-
 bly are women.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The Government did not hinder the activities of various nongovernmental human
 rights groups. These gups freely criticized both the Government and the short-
 lived Ruling Council. The Government was cooperative during an Amnesty Inter-
 national visit in 1994.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution prohibits discrimination based on race, color, sex, language, reli-
 ionlitical or other opinion, national or social origin, birth or other status, and
 the Government generally respected these prohibitions in practice. However, the
 Constitution also recognizes customary law as a parallel legal system, and women
 have severely restricted inheritance and property rights under the traditional
 chieftainship system (see Section 5, Women).
 Women.-flomestic violence, including wife beating, occurs frequently. Reliable
 statistics are not available, but the prob em is beieved to be widespread. In Basotho
 tradition a wife may return to her "maiden home" if physically abused by her hus-
 band. Under common law, wife beating is a criminal offense and defined as assault.
 Women have severely restricted inheritance and property rights under the tradi-
 tional chieftainship system which is recognized under the Constitution. However,
 few domestic violence cases are brought to trial. Women's rights organizations, such
 as the local chapter of the International Federation of Women Lawyers, have taken
 a leading role in educafing women regarding their rights under customary and com-
 mon law, highlighting the importance of women fully participating in the democratic
 process.
 Children.-The Government has not adequately addressed directly children's
 rights and welfare issues, although it has devoted substantial resources to primary
 and secondary education. Education is not compulsory even for the primary levels,
 and there are significant instances particularly in rural areas, where children do not
 attend school because they are involved in subsistence activities in support of their
 family's welfare, or families cannot afford the costs associated with school attend-
 ance (for example, fees for purchase of uniforms, books, and materials). This prob-
 lem of school nonattendance affects boys disproportionately more than girls. In tra-
 ditional rural Basotho society, livestock herding by young boys is a rite of passage
 and a prerequisite to manhood in the community. There is no pattern of societal
 abuse against children, but many children work at a young age (see Section 6.d.).
 People With Disabilities.-Discrimination against physically disabled persons in
 employment, education, or provision of other public or government services is un-
 lawful. However, societal discrimination against the disabled is common. The Gov-
 ernment has not legislated or mandated accessibility to public buildings for the dis-
 abled.
 
 
 180
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-Most citizens speak a common language and
 share common historical and cultural traditions. Small numbers of Asians (pri-
 marily ethnic Chinese and Indians) and South African whites are active in the coun-
 try's commercial life. Economic and racial tension between the Chinese business
 community, specifically textile and garment industry employers, and the Basotho re-
 mained a problem.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Workers have the legal right to join or form unions
 without prior government authorization, with the exception of civil servants.
 The Labor Code specifically prohibits civil servants from joining unions. The Gov-
 ernment regards all work by civil servants as essential. In a judgment by the Leso-
 tho High Court in June concerning a 2-year-old petition filed by the Lesotho Union
 of Public Servants (LUPE) against the registrar of law, Chief Justice Kheola dis-
 missed LUPE's application on the grounds that it was not consistent with the labor
 code. The LUPE filed an appeal. The Ministry of Labor lacks adequate numbers of
 investigators to systematically review these claims by trade unionists. Union leaders
 believe little government action has been taken to remedy this situation.
 Under the 1993 Labor Code, prepared with the assistance of the International
 Labor Organization (ILO), all trade union federations require government registra-
 tion. There are two small trade union federations that rarely cooperate with each
 other, the Lesotho Trade Union Congress and the Lesotho Federation of Democratic
 Unions. Unions are not formally affiliated or tied to political parties.
 The labor and trade union movement is very weak and fragmented. There are sev-
 eral small unions in the public and industrial sectors but there is no unified trades
 union congress. There are cases of multiple unions competitively organizing small
 numbers of workers in the same sector. Overall, unionized workers represent only
 about 10 percent of the work force. Consequently, efforts toward collective bargain-
 ing and tripartite policy-making are not amenable to strong trade union influences.
 There is credible evidence that many employers inhibit union representatives and
 organizers from gaining access to employer premises to organize workers or rep-
 resent them in disputes with owners or managers.
 A large percentage of the male labor force works in the gold and coal mines of
 South Africa. The remainder are primarily engaged in traditional agriculture. A ma-
 jority of Basotho mine workers are members of the South African National Union
 of Mineworkers (NUM). However, as a foreign organization, the NUM is not per-
 mitted to engage in union activities in Lesotho.
 No legally sanctioned strike has occurred since independence in 1966. Legal pro-
 tection for strikers against retribution is not always enforced in cases of illegal
 strikes. In late August, workers at the state-owned Lesotho Telecommunications
 Corporation (LTC) began an industrial action that led to a lock-out, but officials
 called it an illegal strike. The LTC Board of Governors filed an urgent application
 in the Lesotho High Court requesting the Court to bar workers from the LTC prem-
 ises. In October the High Court ruled in favor of the Board of Governors -that these
 employees were illegally on strike. Subsequently, the Board fired over 300 techni-
 cians and other auxiliary staff members and denied them severance and other bene-
 fits. The workers appealed for a reversal against this allegedly wrongful and unfair
 dismissal.
 The Government was successful in negotiating the reinstatement of employees fol-
 lowing several illegal strikes in 1995 and 1996. Security forces violently suppressed
 strikes in the textile, garment, and construction industries during 1994 and once
 during 1996.
 There were no instances of governmental restrictions on international affiliations
 or contacts by unions or their members.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-All legally recognized trade
 unions in principle enjoy the right to organize and bargain collectively, but in prac-
 tice the authorities often restrict these rights. Employers are often not cooperative
 in this area. Employees are often threatened with expulsion and loss of employment
 once they join unions. There is credible evidence that some employers in the textile
 and garment sector engage in the use of blacklists to deny employment to workers
 who have been fired by one employer within that sector. Although there was some
 collective bargaining activity between unions and employers to set wage and benefit
 rates, employers generally continued to set wage rates through unilateral action.
 There is a large backlog of industrial dispute cases on the docket of the Labor
 Court, which has only one labor judge who is only now dealing with cases filed in
 1995.
 
 
 There are several industrial zones, in which mostly textile and apparel firms en-
 gage in manufacturing for export. All national labor laws apply in these industrial
 zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Government specifically pro-
 hibits forced and bonded labor by children, and there were no reports that it oc-
 curred. The 1987 Employment Act prohibits forced or compulsory labor, and there
 is no indication that such labor is practiced.
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment.-The Gov-
 ernment specifically prohibits forced and bonded labor by children, and there were
 no reports that it occurred (see Section 6.c.).
 The legal minimum age for employment in commercial or industrial enterprises
 is 14. In practice, however, children under age 14 are often employed in the textile
 and garment sector and in family-owned businesses. As much as 15 percent of the
 textile work force of some 15,000 may be children between the ages of 12 and 15,
 according to a 1994 study by a foreign government. After visiting all 14 of Lesotho's
 nonpartisan garment producers in 1994, the ILO, responding to a complaint by
 trade unions in the textile and clothing industry, was not able to confirm the unions'
 allegation of illegal child labor.
 There are prohibitions against the employment of minors in commercial, indus-
 trial, or nonfamily enterprises involving hazardous or dangerous working conditions,
 but enforcement is very lax. The Ministry of Labor and Employment's Inspectorate
 is severely understaffed. Young people under 18 years of age may not be recruited
 for employment outside of the country. In traditional society, the rigorous and occa-
 sionally dangerous working conditions for the country's young livestock herdboys are
 considered a rite of passage and a prerequisite to manhood within rural Basotho
 culture which is beyond the reach of labor laws (see Section 5 Children.)
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-Wages are low. The monthly minimum wage
 for unskilled labor is $68 (320 maloti); for a heavy vehicle operator it is $131 (616
 maloti). Minimum wages in lower skilled jobs are insufficient to ensure a decent
 standard of living for a worker and family. Most wage earners supplement their in-
 come through subsistence agriculture or remittances from relatives employed in
 South Africa. Many employers now pay more than minimum wages in an effort to
 attract and retain motivated employees. There are also indications that some em-
 ployers, especially in export sectors, treat the minimum wage as a maximum wage,
 rather than a minimum. This situation is made possible by the high levels of unem-
 ployment and underemployment, which offer a large pool of surplus unskilled labor
 that bids down wage rates and undermines job security for workers who make de-
 mands for better wages and conditions of work.
 The labor code spells out basic worker rights, including a maximum 45-hour work-
 week, a weekly rest period of at least 24 hours, 12 days of paid leave per year, and
 paid public holidays. The labor code requires employers to provide adequate light,
 ventilation, and sanitary facilities for employees and to install and maintain ma-
 chinery in a manner designed to minimize the risk of injury. In practice employers
 generally follow these regulations only within the wage economy in urban areas,
 and the Ministry of Labor and Employment enforces the regulations haphazardly.
 The Labor Code does not explicitly protect the right of workers to remove them-
 selves from hazardous situations without prejudice to employment. However, Labor
 Code sections on safety in the workplace and dismissal imply that dismissal in such
 circumstances would be illegal.
