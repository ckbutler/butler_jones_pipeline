 HUNGARY
 Communist rule imposed by the Soviet Union has been a fact
 in Hungary for more than three decades, except for a brief
 period during the Hungarian revolution in 1956. The
 Hungarian Socialist Workers (Communist) Party has
 maintained a thorough monopoly on political power.
 Although a number of citizens' rights are prescribed by
 the Constitution, in practice the exercise of such rights
 is determined and controlled by the Communist Party.
 Prior to the 1956 revolution, the Hungarian Government
 followed rigid Stalinist policies. Beginning in the early
 1960's, after a half-decade of extreme repression under
 Janos Kadar following the Soviet armed intervention,
 Hungary gradually eased internal controls, permitting a
 modest degree of economic well-being and cultural
 diversity. This easing of controls represented an attempt
 by the Kadar Government to accommodate popular opposition
 to the rigid restrictions of the 1950's. Political
 expression still is tightly controlled, and participation
 in the political process is not possible outside the
 Communist Party. The party has sought public support
 through an explicitly stated policy of social
 reconciliation under the tenet 'who is not against us is
 with us." The Communist Party's mass organization, the
 'People's Patriotic Front,* has also sought to ally itself
 more broadly with what it interprets as the aspirations of
 the Hungarian people.
 Although the Hungarian authorities deny that judicial
 sentences are meted out for 'political reasons,* and
 instead cite arrests and prosecutions for crimes "against
 the State and humanity," Hungarian officials themselves
 admit that there are 'political" prisoners. In 1980 they
 claimed there were less than 50. Emigration is possible
 within limits. Visits abroad, including to Western
 countries, are also possible within somewhat wider
 limits. The practice of religion is allowed only within
 the framework of agreements reached between the Hungarian
 churches and the Government. The Government, however, has
 warned against 'evolving forms' of religious dogma and
 activities which may provide a facade for anti-state
 manifestations, an apparent reference to incipient
 pacificism and conscientious objection to military.
 service. Atheism is the official dogma.   Secret police,
 arbitrary prosecutors, and other coercive institutions
 exist, but have been somewhat curtailed. Party and
 government officials claim to have eradicated many of the
 abuses of "socialist legality' which characterized the
 pre-1956 period.
 The Soviet Union has maintained military forces in Hungary
 since the end of World War II. Approximately 60,000
 Soviet soldiers are currently stationed there -- roughly
 the same number as prior to the 1956 revolution. This,
 and Hungary's geographic position, allow the Soviet Union
 a large degree of influence over Hungarian domestic
 policies.
 1.     Respect for the Integrity of the Person,
 Including Freedom from:
 
 
 923
 a. Killing
 There is no evidence that killing for political motives
 occurs in Hungary.
 b. Torture
 The 1972 Constitution of the Hungarian People's Republic
 states: 'In the Hungarian People's Republic, citizens
 have the right to the protection of life, integrity of the
 body, and the preservation of good health.* There are no
 known instances of torture in 1982 or in recent years.
 c. Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 There have been no known:summary executions in Hungary in
 recent years (although some occurred during -- and a much
 larger number after -- the suppression of the 1956
 revolution). Mistreatment of those who may have
 participated in the revolution is believed to have ceased
 gradually after the end of the so-called consolidation
 phase in 1960-62, although there are reports that some who
 were involved and who remain in Hungary continue to have.
 their activities limited. Citizens, in principle, may
 bring complaints against the police.
 There are three levels of punitive incarceration in
 Hungary: 'workhouse', with somewhat liberal visiting,
 outside work, and leave privflegesl *jail', which is more
 punitive; and 'prison', which means a maximum-security
 penitentiary. Confinement conditions vary in relation to
 the category level of incarceration, but all levels are
 believed to provide adequate diet and health care.
 Hardened criminals are confined separately from those
 convicted of petty crimes. With varying degrees of
 frequency, depending on levels of imprisonment, prisoners
 have rights to visitation by family members, other
 relatives, and friends. There does not appear to be
 deliberate and willful or systematic mistreatment of
 prisoners.
 d. Disappearance
 There have been no reported disappearances in Hungary
 during 1982.
 e. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 Citizens seem generally free from arbitrary arrest. Upon
 arrest, a detainee must be informed in writing of what
 offense he or she is suspected of having committed, and
 can be held at a police station for a maximum of 72 hours
 before charges must be filed. There is no right of bail
 or of provisional pretrial liberty. Although authorities
 have some discretion to grant pretrial liberty, they
 rarely do so. In cases of suspicion for major crimes, a
 person can be held in jail 30 days before trial, renewable
 twice for a maximum of three months.
 Hungary's new penal code, adopted in 1979, contains an
 article on incitement which permits officials to prosecute
 for a wide range of utterances or statements. There are
 reports of individuals being sentenced for denouncing the
 
 
 924
 communist Party or the Soviet occupation of Hungary. Not
 all cases of incitement involve political matters and
 frequently such cases result in short or suspended
 sentences. Official statistics show that 75 cases arose
 in 1981, resulting in 35 indictments, 20 convictions of
 adults involving imprisonment, and one conviction of a
 minor involving imprisonment.
 Another penal code provision on 'espionage" provides for
 punishing 'a person who obtains, collects, or gives out
 data which can be used against the Hungarian People's
 Republic with the purpose of forwarding them to a foreign
 government or organization...' Neither the nature of the
 data transmitted nor the nature of the recipient
 organization is clearly defined, thus allowing a broad
 interpretation by the authorities of the kind of 'data*
 considered to be proscribed.
 In general, however, the new penal code is somewhat more
 lenient than the previous one. It provides lesser
 penalties for so-called political crimes on a small scale,
 such as offhand statements against the party or
 Government. Many such crimes are now misdemeanors, with
 the first offense often resulting in a short (three
 months) suspended sentence and a fine (usually about
 $40.00, which is roughly equivalent to 20 percent of a
 worker's monthly wage). At the same time, the new penal
 code has taken a harder line against economic corruption
 with crimes of this nature often resulting in more severe
 penalties. It appears to be difficult to get reduced or
 suspended sentences in corruption cases.
 A public statement by the Hungarian Minister of Justice in
 October 1980 said that two-tenths of one percent of all
 Hungarians in jail can be classified as political
 prisoners, indicating an actual total of less than 50
 individuals, The Minister described three categories of
 political prisoners: those accused of war crimes,
 espionage, and 'incitement against the Hungarian
 Constitution.' There is no independent information to
 either substantiate or rebut the Minister's statement.
 f. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The Constitution stipulates that all court proceedings are
 open, except for cases specifically exempted by law (those
 involving morals or state secrets); and that 'all courts
 are independent* and 'subject to laws.' All courts deal
 with criminal, political, and security cases. There are
 very few closed trials in Hungary. Those which are closed
 usually involve ,national security' not otherwise
 defined. The Hungarian Government claims that defendants
 in closed trials are guaranteed the same rights as in any
 other trial. In general, judicial procedures are
 investigatory rather than adversarial in nature. There is
 no trial by jury. Defendants have the right to choose
 their own counsel. Courts normally seek to apply the law
 in a methodical fashion. In political cases it is assumed
 that the outcome is determined in advance by the
 authorities when they decide to bring the case to trial.
 Non-political trials-are more likely to be handled in an
 impartial manner than are trials involving offenses
 considered to be political or crimes *against the state.'
 
 
 925
 g. Invasion of the Home
 The Constitution guarantees citizens' personal freedom and
 inviolability, as well as the secrecy of correspondence
 and privacy of the home, but in practice these are
 violated when the authorities determine this to be "in the
 interests of socialism." Hungarian practice does,
 however, appear to afford a measure of due process. For
 example, search warrants are necessary in all cases.
 House searches require a court order, and must be carried
 out in the presence of two witnesses. A written inventory
 must be prepared of items removed from the premises.
 Available information corroborates general adherence to
 these procedures. It is assumed that such procedural
 steps as issuance of search warrants are 'expedited" in
 instances-of special interest, such as state security
 cases.
 2.     Respect for Civil and Political Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution guarantees free speech and free press but
 they are subject to limitations in practice. According to
 the Constitution, these rights are qualified by the need
 to conform to the 'interests of socialism and the
 people." The Communist Party or the governmental
 authorities control all forms of media. A Hungarian
 citizen is, in practice, unable to speak publicly against
 the communist form of government or Hungary's alliance
 with the Soviet Union. If the citizen opposes these basic
 tenets publicly, he or she may be subjected to varying
 measures of admonition, harassment, and punishment. There
 is no legal protection for the citizen who exceeds the
 political limits on expression established by the
 Communist Party. Pervasive self-censorship in media and
 cultural circles.serves to remind the citizen where the
 boundaries are. The authorities have banned the
 circulation of certain books or articles considered not to
 conform with accepted positions.
 The most recent example of such a banning was a book of
 essays written by some 70 Hungarian intellectuals in
 memory of Istvan Bibo, Minister of State in the Government
 of Imre Nagy during the Hungarian Revolution in 1956 and a
 prominent contemporary political thinker. The Hungarian
 authorities refused to publish the book in 1981, because a
 number of the book's essays criticized Soviet domination
 of Eastern Europe and contested the legitimacy of
 Communist Party rule. Typescript copies have been
 circulated informally among intellectuals and reportedly
 have been deposited in restricted access sections of some
 libraries.
 Dissident activity in Hungary remains largely confined to
 several hundred intellectuals who live primarily in
 Budapest. Political dissidence does not seem to be a mass
 phenomenon. Hungary's economic progress over the last
 decade, its emphasis on consumerism, and its willingness
 to permit more frequent travel to the.West than most other
 Warsaw Pact nations, have all contributed to the relative
 marginality of the dissident movement vis-a-vis Hungarian
 society as a whole. The Government has also shown a
 general willingness to tolerate without explicit reply or
 
 
 926
 rejoinder some expressions of dissent. It has, however,
 occasionally expelled or permitted the emigration to the
 West of outspoken opponents of the political system. In
 at least two such cases, individuals later have returned
 to Hungary and resumed their residence and dissident
 activities.
 Hungarian dissidents meet irregularly for private
 discussions of political and other topics. One of the
 several groups of Hungarian dissidents is active in the
 distribution of prohibited books and articles in samizdat
 (self publishing) form. Three issues of the most
 sophisticated samizdat publication, the journal 'Beszelo,"
 which discusses subjects and themes not permitted in the
 official press, have been circulated in this way since
 late 1981. Each was printed in approximately 1,000
 copies, which were then informally distributed to a wider
 readership throughout the country. In early summer 1982 a
 campaign was begun to harass several dissidents, including
 those prominently involved with "Beszelo'. The campaign,
 which involved following by and taunts from
 plainclothesmen, lasted for three weeks, but resulted in
 no arrests or other formal action. Shortly before the
 official harassment ended, a number of prominent Hungarian
 intellectuals sent a letter to the Minister of the
 ,Interior asserting that this was not how problems should
 be dealt with in Hungary. In August, several dissidents
 distributed leaflets which called attention to the
 presence of Soviet forces and weapons in Hungary to
 participants in an officially sponsored peace march in
 downtown Budapest. The police eventually stopped the
 distribution but made no arrests. In December, the
 Government stepped up the pressure on the dissidents,
 searching their homes and confiscating manuscipts and
 duplicating machines. The popular Tuesday evening
 samizdat "boutique* was raided on two succeeding weeks.
 This renewed intimidation was accompanied by a series of
 notably sharp media attacks against the oppositionist
 intellectuals and their alleged Western supporters.
 Hungarian press, radio, and television are
 government-owned and centrally managed. They observe
 current party guidelines, which include the maxim that the
 role of a journalist is to further the cause of
 communism. A formal structure of censorship is not needed
 since writers and editors themselves are presumed to
 understand the basic premises of domestic and foreign
 policy. Some carefully nuanced differing views
 occasionally appear in the press and literature, but they
 are usually well within the general constraints imposed by
 the party. Infrequently, Western viewpoints can be heard
 on Hungarian radio and television. These may be the views
 of a Western spokesman, broadcast together with those of
 other participants in a panel discussion, or straight
 reporting of a Western official's comments on a topical
 international issue, such as US-Soviet relations or events
 in Afghanistan or Poland. Hungary does not jam Western
 radios, and Austrian and Yugoslav radio and television
 broadcasts reach much of the country. Hungary permits
 some access to Western literature and films, including
 some television programs and about forty American films
 annually. Some Western periodicals are available in
 limited quantities in Hungary, usually at newsstands
 frequented by foreigners.
 
 
 927
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Athough the Constitution guarantees freedom of assembly
 and the right to form associations, these rights are
 qualified by the need to conform to the "interests of
 socialism and the people.' In practice government
 approval or tacit acceptance is required for the exercise
 of these rights.
 As noted above, Hungarian dissidents are loosely
 organized. In December 1979, young intellectuals and
 professionals formed a group which'they called the
 Foundation for the Assistance of the Poor (known by its
 Hungarian acronym SZETA). The stated purpose of the group
 was to raise money and provide financial,' legal, and other
 assistance for the poor within Hungarian society. Their
 activities included a public auction of works donated by
 Hungarian artists in December 1980. The group raised
 approximately-$8,000 at the auction for distribution to
 the poor. Other dissidents meet frequently at an informal
 'free university' in Budapest, where academicians and
 dissidents lecture on topics which are not discussed in
 formal university institutions. In August 1982,
 approximately 50 individuals participated in an
 unauthorized rally on behalf of the Polish workers' union
 Solidarity in a major. Budapest square. The four
 organizers were detained for several hours and released
 once the event ended. No jail sentences for this or for
 other dissident activity were known to have been given in
 1982.
 The Hungarian National Trade Union Council is one of the
 party's mass organizations and is controlled and directed:
 by the party. It serves the purpose of indoctrinating
 workers in party policy. It also .purports to represenit
 worker interests.within certain bounds. The Secretary
 General of the council is a member of the Party
 Politburo. He heads council delegations in regularly
 scheduled meetings with the party leadership and with the
 Government over labor policy, economic planning, prices,
 wages, and other economic issues. On the local and
 enterprise level, the council administers a system of shop
 distribution of bonus money, profit sharing,
 enterprise-controlled housing, health care, union vacation
 plans, and other benefits. Stewards can veto management
 decisions on personnel actions, plant safety, and other
 work-related issues which do not comply with collective
 agreements and labor'regulations. Disputed questions are
 referred to higher authorities for arbitration.
 The Hungarian Constitution does not provide for the right
 to strike, but as a number of Hungarian commentators have
 pointed out recently, strikes are not prohibited by law.
 The Secretary General of the council admitted in October
 1980 that localized strikes of a few hours' duration had
 occurred in Hungary due to the failure of management and
 the local union officials to implement existing
 agreements. A major work stoppage which has either
 affected an entire industrial sector or assumed
 nation-wide proportions has not taken place in over a
 quarter of a century.
 
 
 928
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Although freedom of conscience and freedom of religious
 practice are guaranteed in the Constitution, they are
 subject to restrictions. The practice of religion in
 Hungary is in principle opposed, but not rigorously
 impeded by the State. Steadfastly committed to atheism,
 the authorities for tactical reasons profess the
 acceptability of believers and non-believers working
 together in the interest of "socialist society.' The
 Government has generally improved relations with the
 hierarchies of the major religious denominations, many of
 which have representatives in the Parliament. Recently
 the Government agreed to allow a Jesuit-staffed center for
 meditation and teaching to open in May, 1983 -- the first
 Jesuit facility in Hungary since the order was officially
 dissolved in 1950. At the same time, the State appears to
 be purposefully undermining the future of religion in-
 Hungary by limiting the number of Church-sponsored schools
 and restricting the hours available for the religious
 instruction of young people. Religious beliefs can limit
 the citizen's advancement in government and in society in
 general.
 There are some 19 significant religious denominations in
 Hungary which are recognized by law, plus several minor
 sects, such as Jehovah's Witnesses. Sizeable religious
 groups in Hungary include Roman Catholics (5.25 million),
 Reformed Calvinists (2 million), Evangelical Lutherans
 (0.5 million), and Jews (100,000). The total number of
 persons manifesting some religious belief is estimated at
 8.5 million-out of a population of 10.7 million.
 The Churches do not act as organizing centers for
 dissent. Dissension did arise within the Catholic Church
 during 1982, however. The controversy centered on the
 so-called basic community movement, which accused the
 Church leadership of being 'collaborationist.' The
 Primate criticized the movement and suspended two priests
 who advocated conscientious objection to military
 service. Five others were transferred to lesser posts.
 In June, the Bench of Bishops decided to deny to Father
 Bulanyi, the acknowledged leader of one segment of the
 basic communities, the right to say Mass, preach, and
 administer the sacraments in his diocese. The Hungarian
 authorities have not detained or arrested any clergy, but
 approximately a dozen young people have been sentenced to
 prison terms ranging up to three years for refusing
 military service.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country,
 Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 All adult citizens are issued an identity booklet and must
 carry it with them while traveling; they must register
 with local police when moving from one locality to
 another. It is possible to transfer permanently from
 rural areas to Budapest, but this is not encouraged
 because of overcrowding and a scarcity of housing in the
 capital.
 Hungarian emigration law is restrictive. A person can
 normally apply to emigrate only if over 55 years of age
 and joining a parent, spouse, or child abroad. However,
 
 
 929
 the law provides for exceptions in individual cases, and
 approximately 90 percent of Hungarians who apply to
 emigrate for purposes of family reunification receive
 permission. Persons who are refused permission to
 emigrate may appeal and reapply; reapplications are
 sometimes successful, particularly if there are special
 humanitarian considerations. There are no systematic
 official sanctions, such as loss of employment or of
 housing, imposed on persons who seek to emigrate, and
 emigrants may take a modest amount of personal property
 with them.
 Hungary follows a cautiously liberal practice in
 permitting visits to the West, and eased its travel
 regulations to Western countries effective January 1,
 1982. Some 477,000 Hungarians currently visit the West
 annually, while approximately 5,070,000 visits are made
 annually to other Eastern European Warsaw Pact countries.
 It is possible to pay for trips to Western Europe and
 beyond, including North America, in Hungarian currency.
 Hungarian citizens now legally have the opportunity to
 visit the West at least once a year -- instead of every
 third year as before -- if relatives or friends abroad pay
 the costs. The modest hard currency allotment private
 travellers can receive once every three years to defray
 hard currency expenses was also increased.
 Exit permission for both Hungarian tourists and emigrants
 can be and occasionally is denied for vague *reasons of
 state." There are indications that such permission In
 certain instances has been denied to dissidents in order
 to induce moderation in their activities. The right of
 travel remains at the discretion of the State ratherthan
 a prerogative of the individual. Persons who have
 emigrated legally from Hungary have a legal right to
 return. Persons who leave Hungary as visitors with
 ermission to stay abroad only temporarily and who then
 ail to return are subject to prosecution and sentencing
 either in absentia or upon their return. Hungary appears
 to follow, however, a discretionary practice of treating
 such persons leniently, if they return. Prosecution may
 not occur or, when it does,'may amount to a formality
 leading to a suspended sentence. Returnees probably would
 not be granted the privilege of visiting abroad again for
 up to five years. Assiduous prosecution and other
 sanctions, such as deprivation of former employment,
 sometimes occur. Recentlyi a young Hungarian dissident
 writer who remained in the West as a refugee received an
 eight-year jail term in absentia and his close relative
 was forced to move into a smaller apartment.
 e. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Hungary is ruled by a group within the Hungarian Socialist
 Workers Party. Political participation is not possible
 outside the party or the party-sanctioned organizations.
 The Hungarian Constitution states that the Hungarian
 Socialist Workers (Communist) Party represents the
 "working class' and the 'interests of the whole of the
 society.' The Communist Party uses party-sanctioned
 organizations such as the Patriotic People's Front, trade
 unions, and the Communist Youth League to elicit public
 support.
 
 
 930
 To an extent the party invites the opinions and
 recommendations of non-party organizations (for example,
 from cooperatives' associations) on policy proposals in
 which they have an interest, but any implementation is at
 the discretion of the party. It appears that deliberation
 within the party about proposed policies and actions can
 be somewhat open, but decisions once made and handed down
 by the leadership must be loyally followed.
 Although more than one-third of the members of the
 National Assembly are women, there are few women at top
 levels in the Government or party. Only one of the 19
 members of the Council of Ministers and one of the 13
 members of the Politburo is female. The party officially
 espouses the enhancement of the role of women in Hungarian
 society, but results to date are limited.
 3.     Government Attitude Regarding International
 and Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged
 Violations of Human Rights
 The Hungarian Government refuses to accept outside charges
 or investigations of alleged human rights violations on
 the basis that this is *interference in internal
 affairs.' In contrast to some other East European
 countries, however, Hungary has shown a willingness to
 engage in discussions with other countries on all aspects
 of the Helsinki Final Act, including its human rights
 provisions. In certain elements of its bilateral dialogue
 with some other countries, Hungary has been willing to
 discuss quietly some individual problem cases,
 particularly cases dealing with emigration. Amnesty
 International's 1982 report was concerned with
 restrictions on freedom of expression, imprisonment of
 conscientious objectors, and the use of the death penalty.
 4.     Economic, Social, and Cultural Situation
 Industrialized and somewhat decentralized, Hungary's
 economy has many features which are unique in Eastern
 Europe. Most state-owned enterprises enjoy a high degree
 of autonomy. Government economic authorities do not as a
 rule impose specific production quotas on enterprises, but
 usually rely on macroeconomic policy tools to guide the
 economy. Some consumer prices, especially for food items,
 are set largely by free market forces. Professional and
 skilled workers have extensive employment opportunities,
 on a part-time or full-time basis, in the private and
 quasi-private sectors. There are no food shortages in
 Hungary. Private farming activities have long been
 encouraged on both state and collective farms. Private
 farming accounts for about one-third of Hungary's total
 farm production. Moreover, the Hungarian Government has
 recently begun encouraging private enterprise-type
 activities in the consumer services sector and in small
 industrial enterprises. However, while the significance
 of private industrial activities is growing, the 'private
 sector" is not expected to become a large component of the
 Hungarian economy. In short, through the combination of
 flexible prices and enterprise autonomy, as well as
 through Government encouragement of private farming within
 collectivized agriculture, and private enterprise-type
 activities, Hungary has produced an economic system that
 is more sensitive to consumer needs than other East
 European economies.
 
 
 931
 One area of the consumer sector where Hungary lags behind
 is in housing. In 1980, there was an average of 1.5
 persons per room in Hungarian dwellings. Although this
 figure reflects overcrowding, it is an improvement over
 1970, when the average was about two persons per room. A
 substantial portion of this improvement in housing
 conditions can be attributed to the Government's
 encouragement of private house construction.
 A milestone in Hungary's progress toward a more
 decentralized economic system was achieved on October 1,
 1981, when a unified rate of currency exchange for both
 tourist and commercial transactions was established. The
 unified rate of exchange is set.weekly generally in line
 with free market rates in Western Europe.
 Hungary's standard of living, relatively high for Eastern
 Europe, is reflected in such measurements as a life
 expectancy at birth of 70.8 years, an infant mortality
 rate per 1,000 live births of 23.1, and a ratio of caloric
 supply available for consumption relative to nutritional
 requirements of 134 percent. Hungary's population is
 slowly declining, the average annual growth rate from
 1970-1979 was 0.4. Emphasis on education has yielded an
 adult literacy rate of 98 percent. In 1979, the primary
 school enrollment ratio was 96 for male children and 97
 for female.
