 ARMENIA
 Armenia has a constitutional government in which the President has extensive
 powers and the role of the legislature relative to the executive branch is severely
 circumscribed. The President appoints the Prime Minister, who is now in charge of
 the Cabinet. President Levon Ter-Petrossian was reelected in a controversial multi-
 candidate election in September, which was flawed by numerous irregularities and
 serious breaches of the election law. The opposition rejected the official election re-
 sults and asked the Constitutional Court to invalidate the Central Election Commis-
 sion (CEC) decision on the results and to order a new election. The Court's handling
 of the case did not assuage doubts about the credibility of the official election re-
 sults. A transitional National Assembly in which ruling party loyalists hold about
 88 percent of the seats was elected in July 1995; local and international observers
 characterized the 1995 elections as "generally free, but not fair." Elections for a new
 National Assembly are scheduled for 1999. The Constitution provides for an inde-
 pendent judiciary, however, in practice judges are subject to political pressure from
 both the executive and legislature.
 In October the Ministry of the Interior and the Ministry of National Security com-
 bined to form the Ministry of Internal Affairs and National Security which is re-
 sponsible for domestic security, intelligence activities, border control, and supervises
 t   national police force. The Ministry of Defense assists in domestic security during
 serious internal disorders. Some of the security forces committed serious human
 rights abuses.
 Economic reforms continued to move forward in the face of many obstacles: The
 collapse of external trade links and sources of raw material that followed the Soviet
 Union's demise; the lingering effects of the massive 1988 earthuake; and the threat
 of a renewed conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh. Despite these problems, gross domestic
 product (GDP) increased by 6 percent in 1996. Per capita annual GDP rose by about
 14 percent to $533. Inflation remained low, and the currency was stable. The Gov-
 ernment passed a property law and is currently in the process of issuing titles to
 real estate owners.
 The Government's human rights record remained uneven, improving incremen-
 tally in some areas, while serious problems remained in others. Its manipulation of
 the September presidential election continued to restrict citizens' ability to change
 their government. Although the Government passed an improved election law and
 selected new members of the CEC, including a new chairman, international observ-
 ers reported that serious breaches of the election law and numerous irregularities
 resulted in a lack of confidence in the integrity of the overall election process. Inter-
 national observers urged that the Government implement recommendations of inter-
 national experts to address the flaws and rebuild public confidence in the electoral
 process. Members of the security forces bat detainees during arrest and interroga-
 tion and also beat passersby in areas adjoining demonstrations. These violations of
 the law by internal security personnel, notably the sixth directorate of the Ministry
 of Internal Affairs in Yerevan, continued in a climate of impunity from government
 sanction. Security forces continued to arbitrarily arrest and detain citizens. During
 the government crackdown following a violent demonstration after the presidential
 election, authorities beat and detained members of the opposition and demonstra-
 tors.
 The Government signed an agreement with the International Committee of the
 Red Cross (ICRC) giving general and private access to detainees; however, the Gov-
 ernment's cooperation in implementing the agreement was uneven. Security forces
 also infringed on citizens' privacy rights. The judiciary is subject to political pres-
 sure; however, in one notable case a court reversed the illegal actions of government
 officials; a district court judge overturned the decision of the Minister of Justice to
 dismiss the leadership and transfer ownership of a prominent independent news-
 paper. The Government continued to place some restrictions on freedom of the
 press; security forces beat and detained journalists after the September election, and
 journalists practice some self-censorship. Although reduced from previous years,
 
 
 829
 credible reports of harassment and intimidation of journalists and editors continued.
 The number of local independent television and radio stations grew and, together
 with the press, were increasingly vocal and critical. However, the Government con-
 tinued to domnnate nationwide television and radio broadcasting. The Government
 imposed some limits on freedom of assembly and association especially during the
 post-election crackdown. A previously suspended prominent political party, the Ar-
 menian Revolutionary Federation (AF/Dashnaks), was not reinstated, although the
 authorities tolerated its gatherings, news conferences and activities, and the Prime
 Minister initiated meetings with its representatives. The National Democratic
 Union's (NDU) party office in Yerevan was closed for about 2 months following the
 postelection violence and not reopened until after the Constitutional Court ruling
 on the NDU's election grievances. The Government retains some limits on freedom
 of religion. Discrimination against women and minorities is a problem.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killings.-There were no reported cases of po-
 litical or extrajudicial killings.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reported cases of political disappearance.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, and Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution and the law prohibit torture. However, the practice of security per-
 sonnel beating detainees during arrest and interrogation continued. For example,
 Aramazd Zakaryan, an opposition National Assembly deputy with immunity, was
 beaten badly and detaine or 2 days before being released to a hospital with broken
 ribs and a concussion. There were credible reports of threats to detainees' family
 members. In the first days of the postpresidential election crackdown, while a ban
 on meetings was in effect, nonuniformed internal security forces beat and harassed
 passersby in the area where a demonstration was held. Two cases of police brutality
 were registered in the first half of the year. In each case, a detainee committed sui-
 cide in detention after having been severely beaten by police. Both cases are under
 consideration in the Supreme Court. Most cases of police brutality go unreported.
 The office of the Prosecutor General (Attorney General) investigates allegations of
 mistreatment. If the investigation reveals evidence to support the allegations and
 if there is a serious violation of the law, the prosecutor's office files criminal charges.
 Less serious cases are referred to the Ministry of Internal Affairs for administrative
 action.
 There is no available information on whether or not the five cases of police brutal-
 ity reported in 1995 were ever prosecuted.
 Prison conditions are Spartan and often overcrowded. According to reliable re-
 ports, prisoners in "kartser" receive food every other day. There are not adequate
 medical and sanitary facilities in prisons, communicable disease is common, and
 some prisoners reportedly have died of treatable diseases.
 In January the Government agreed to permit independent monitoring of prisoners
 by the ICRC. The ICRC was granted unaccompanied access to many political detain-
 ees. However, while the Ministry of National Security honored the terms of the
 ICRC agreement, often the Ministry of Interior was not cooperative. The ICRC expe-
 rienced significant difficulties in gaining access to prisoners detained by the Min-
 istry of the Interior after the September 25 assault on Parliament by some members
 of the opposition, and ICRC representatives were compelled to wait for more than
 3 weeks for access to these prisoners. Only occasional visits were allowed. The Pros-
 ecutor General's cooperation in carrying out the agreement was uneven.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Authorities continued to arbitrarily ar-
 rest and detain citizens without legal warrants. Those arrested are frequently
 brought to prison without notification of family members. It is often several days
 before family members obtain information as to whether someone has been arrested
 and their location. Access of lawyers and family members to prisoners is often re-
 stricted, particularly in the weeks after arrest.
 During the Government crackdown on the opposition after the flawed presidential
 elections, international and domestic observers reported that 17 prominent opposi-
 tion figures and over 100 participants in the September 25 demonstration were de-
 tained for violation of Article 74 of the Criminal Code, "participation in mass dis-
 order". Sixteen of the latter group were still being held on this charge at year's end.
 Many detainees were held for 15 days of "administrative detention," during which
 several were reportedly beaten, and access by international humanitarian groups
 was delayed or denied.
 In addition four opposition deputies were detained before being stripped of their
 immunity by the National Assembly on September 26. During that National Assem-
 
 
 bly session, progovernment members of parliament assaulted some of these opposi-
 tion deputies in front of national television cameras.
 The transitional provisions of the Constitution provide that Soviet-era procedures
 for searches and arrests are to be maintained until the Soviet-era Criminal Code
 and Criminal Procedure Code are redrafted and brought into line with the Constitu-
 tion. A suspect may be jailed for up to 12 months pending trial and completion of
 the investigation. If no sentence is passed during the period of detention the sus-
 pect must be released. In spite of this prvision, three suspects in a "satellite" case
 of the "Dr" trial were he~d for almost two years without trial. Informed sources
 stated that the three were charged with not reporting a state crime. After having
 been held almost a year beyo   that allowed by law, they were released on their
 own recognizance pending the appeals in the "Dr" trial.
 The Iong-unnng "Dro" trial concluded on December 10 with the judge pronounc-
 ing all defendants guilty and imposing three death sentences. The hig ht ranking
 Dashnak defendant, Hrant Markaryan, was found guilty of only minor crimes, lead-
 ing Dashnak Party representatives to claim that the judge had found no link be-
 tween the Dashnak Party and the Dr". The existence of such a link had been the
 government's justification for suspending the Dashnak Party and related media out-
 lets in 1994. The verdict has been appealed by both sides m the case. A second case,
 the "Trial of 31", opened on March 15, and at year's end had completed only its first
 sta The main defendant, Dashnak leader      an  ovannisyan, went on a hunger
 w     in early November to prtest delays in the proceedings. He stpped his strike
 2 weeks later, reportedly at the request of the Dashnak Party. Most defendants in
 the case alleged they had been tortured and pressured into giving false testimony.
 Defense lawyers have filed numerous motions to investigate these allegations, but
 thus far the judge has denied the motions.
 There is no prevision for bail although detainees may sign a document and remain
 at liberty under their own recognizance pending trial.
 On May 19, the Government released all known prisoners in custody at that time
 in conjunction with the Nagorn-Karabk conflict. Subsequently, there were re-
 ports of the capture of other Pns who had not been released at year's end.
 There were no reports of forced exile.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Triai.-Although the Constitution nominally provides for
 an independent judiciary, in practie courts are subject to political pressure from
 both the executive and the legislature. The previsions of the Constitution do not ap-
 pear designed to insulate the courts from political pressure. Under the Constitution,
 the Justice Council, headed by the President, the Pros ctor General, and the Jus-
 tice Minister, appoints and diciplines judges for the tribunal courts of first in-
 stance, review courts, and the Court of Appeals. The President appoints the other
 14 members of the Justice Council and 4 of the 9 Constitutional Court judges. This
 gives the President dominant influence in appointing and dismissing judges at all
 levels. Judges are subject to review by the President through the Council of Justice
 after 3 years, whereupon they serve until they reach the age of 65.
 The judicial system is in transition. A reform effort is now underway to com-
 pletely revamp the judiciary, but has only just begun. Judges during the transition
 periodmust use a confusing array of Soviet-era laws and some new civil and crimi-
 nal laws. However, civil and criminal odes are atiw under preparation. Adoption of
 new civil and criminal codes and enabling legislation to implement them is critical
 to the-succeos of judicial reform.
 According to the transitional prvisions of the Constitution, the existing courts are
 to retain their powers until the new judicial system is established. The existing
 court system comprises a number of district courts, arbitration courts, a lame duck
 supreme court, a newly created Constitutional Court, and a military tribunal. Dis-
 trict courts try the overwhelming majority of cases. There is no prevision for a su-
 preme court in the new Constitution, and the powers of the current court expire
 after a 3-year transition periodl The Constitution envisages the creation of review
 courts and a court of appeals to handle cases previously sent to the Supreme Court.
 The Constitutional Court has jurisdiction over ensuring conformity of legislation
 with the Constitution and approves international agreements. The Court's nine
 members are appointed either by the President or the parliament, the majority of
 which consists of progovernment members. It can only accept those cases proposed
 by the President, one-third of all National Assembly deputies, or election related
 cases brought by candidates for parliament or the presidency. The inherited Soviet
 prsecuterial system views the court largely as a rubber stamp for the procurator
 and not a defender of citizens' rights.
 Many corrupt and inefficient judges were replaced during the year. Early in the
 year, in accordance with constitutional provisions, the President issued a decree ap-
 pointing numerous new judges, replacing over 60 percent of Soviet-era judges.
 
 
 831
 The military tribunal operates essentially as it did in the Soviet era. Military
 prosecutors perform the same functions as their civilian counterparts, operating in
 accordance with the Soviet-era legal code.
 Trials are public except when government secrets are at issue. Defendants are re-
 quired to attend their trials unless they have been accused of a minor crime not
 punishable by imprisonment. Defendants have access to a lawyer of their own choos-
 ing. The court appoints an attorney for any defendant who needs one. Defendants
 may confront witnesses and present evidence. The Constitution provides that those
 accused of crimes shall be informed of charges against them. Defendants and pros-
 ecutors have the right of appeal.
 The Dashnak-related "Dro" trial concluded in December with all 11 defendants re-
 ceiving a guilty verdict. Throughout, the trial was marred by procedural irregular-
 ities, allegations of torture, recanted testimony, and accusations of deliberate delay
 by the authorities in prosecuting the case. However, prominent Dashnak Hrant
 Markarian was acquitted of the charge of murder, discrediting the Government's
 charge of criminal conspiracy between the "Dro Terrorist Organization" and the
 banned Armenian Revolutionary Federation (ARF or "Dashnaks").
 The government reportedly held some political prisoners.
 Credible human rights organizations reported that the Ministry of Justice refused
 to register the nongovernmental organization Committee for the Defense of Political
 Prisoners on the grounds that there were no political prisoners, and such an organi-
 zation was therefore unnecessary.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution prohibits unauthorized searches and preserves citizens' rights to pri-
 vacy and confidentiality of correspondence, conversations, and other messages. Pro-
 cedurally, the security ministries must petition the prosecutor's office for permission
 to tap a telephone or intercept correspondence. The prosecutor's office purportedly
 must find a compelling need for the wiretap before it will grant the agency permis-
 sion to proceed.
 The law requires security forces to obtain a search warrant from a prosecutor be-
 fore conducting a search; in practice, searches continue to be made without a war-
 rant. During the postelction crackdown in September, the offices of the NDU and
 NSDU and homes of prominent NDU and NS         memera were searched without
 warrant. The Government subsequently permitted the reopening of these offices and
 promised compensation to the NSDU office.
 There continued to be violations of the right to privacy during army conscription
 drives. There were several cases in which armed forces recruiters took hostages, in
 order to compel the surrender of draft-evading or deserting relatives. There are
 credible reports of forced onscription of several refugees from Nagoerno-Karabakh
 and Azerbaijan.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speeh and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech
 and the press; however, wbile the Government generally respects freedom of speech,
 it has placed some significant restrictions on freedom of the press. Most independent
 and opposition newspapers operate with extremely limited resources and     on
 the Government for publication and distribution facilities-an arran ement hthas
 continued intact from the Soviet period. However, the Government has begun to di-
 vest itself of the state publishing apparatus and has disbanded the Ministry of In-
 formation.
 A growing number of printed publications present lively debate and a variety of
 views. The opposition press regularly criticizes government officials and policies;
 however, those who report on major corruption or national security issues risk gov-
 ernment and other reprisal such as detention, beatings, threats, false prosecutions,
 and harassing tax audits. The Government provides a list of "forbidden subjects,"
 and accrdingiy journalists practice some self-censorship.
 During the period following the postelection government crackdown in late Sep-
 tember (see Section 2.b.), the opposition press continued to print articles critical of
 the Government, including reports and analyses written by released opposition fig-
 ures. However, security forces beat and detained some members of the press after
 the election. There was no access for the opposition to television or radio after the
 elections. Troops cordoned off state broadcasting outlets and independent HAl-FM
 radio station took itself off the air. The oppositi~on's Hairikhyan was given 10 min-
 utes of alrtime in October to announce the postponement of an opposition rally. The
 new Yerevan Press Club objected strongly to the Government's restrictive draft
 press law, which was pulled back for renewed consideration. Armenian media orga-
 nizations have submitted a new draft press law for government consideration. How-
 
 
 832
 ever, Dashnak party-affiliated media outlets, which were shut down in December
 1994 remained closed.
 Television and radio broadcasting is larely controlled by the Government. There
 are 3 functioning independent radio stations and 10 small independent television
 stations, the latter of which operate largely in the regions outside of Yerevan.
 Broadcast media coverage of presidential candidates prior to the September elec-
 tion gave an overwhelming advantage to incumbent President Ter-Petrossian. The
 Organization 'for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) election observer mis-
 sion noted in its September 24 statement that Ter-Petrossian had 16 times more
 editorial coverage on state television than his nearest challenger in the weeks prior
 to the election. According to the OSCE, this "far exceeded what is normal in such
 contests elsewhere in the world." State television did, however, provide 90 minutes
 of free airtime per presidential candidate during the campaign, and provided more
 balanced coverage than during the 1995 parliamentary elections.
 The judge in a court case involving the ownership of the independent newspaper
 Azg ruled M favor of the local operators and against the Ministry of Justice, which
 was attempting to unilaterally transfer ownership to parties more supportive of the
 current Government.
 There is no evidence that the Government inhibits or censors importation of inter-
 national newspapers and magazines. The Internet and electronic mail have greatly
 increased the amount of foreign and domestic information available to both govern-
 mental and nongovernmental outlets. Middle and upper class Armenians have ac-
 cess to international satellite television from abroad, including Russian and Turkish
 television, which erodes the Government's near monopoly on television.
 The Government respects academic freedom. Over 50 private institutions of high-
 er education have been established since independence in 1991.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 freedom of assembly, and the Government generally respects this right in practice,
 with some important exceptions. On September 24 and 25, massive peaceful dem-
 onstrations were held in Yerevan protesting the results of the September presi-
 dential elections. However, some of the demonstrators turned violent on September
 25, leading successively to a break-in at the parliament building, the beating of the
 Speaker and Deputy Speaker, and a government crackdown which involved banning
 public meetings for 2 weeks. Peaceful demonstrations then resumed.
 The Constitution provides for freedom of association, and the Government gen-
 erally respects this right in practice with some important exceptions. There are reg-
 istration requirements for all parties, associations, and organizations. No political
 parties were refused initial registration in 1996.
 During the   stelection crac down, although parties were not bpnned, opposition
 offices were c osed and one, the NDU office, remained closed until after the Con-
 stitutional Court ruling on its election grievances in November.
 The ARF/Dashnak party, suspended since 1994, had an application for reinstate-
 ment pending with the Ministry of Justice. The Ministry of Justice by year's end
 had yet to provide a written response to the application, although the law requires
 an answer within 30 days of filing. Although the activities of the party are still offi-
 cially suspended, officials have not interfered while the party held a 2-week con-
 gress, elected a new governing body, held news conferences, and actively supported
 the opposition's National Alliance, forming a part of the Alliance's five-party leader-
 ship. The authorities charge that the presence of foreign members in the ARF's rul-
 ing body, the International Bureau, violates the law on public political organiza-
 tions. The party reconstituted its ruling bodies during the year and claims to have
 created purely indigenous local structures.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of religion; how-
 ever, in practice the law imposes restrictions on religious freedom.
 The 1991 Law on Religious Organizations establishes the separation of church
 and state, but grants the Armenian Apostolic Church (the Armenian Orthodox
 Church) special status. A variety of religious organizations, including Protestants,
 Mormons, and others hold services. The Armenian Orthodox clergy resent the in-
 roads made by nonapostolic religions in recent years.
 The law forbids proselytizing and requires all nonapostolic religious denomina-
 tions and organizations to register with the Ministry of Justice. Petitioning organi-
 zations must "be free from materialism and of a purely spiritual nature," and must
 subscribe to a doctrine based on "historically recognized holy Scriptures." A presi-
 dential decree issued in 1993 supplemented the 1991 law and strengthened the posi-
 tion of the Armenian Apostolic Church. The decree enjoins the Council on Religious
 Affairs to investigate the activities of the representatives of registered religious or-
 ganizations and to ban missionaries who engage in activities contrary to their sta-
 tus. No action was taken against missionaries in 1996.
 
 
 833
 A religious organization refused registration cannot publish a newspaper or maga-
 zine, rent a meeting place, have its own program on television or radio, or officially
 sponsor the visas of visitors. One nonapostolic religious organization was denied reg-
 istration by the Ministry of Justice during the year the grounds that it does not per-
 mit military service. Three religious organizations were registered, bringing the
 total of churches and religious organizations registered to 43.
 Despite the Government's piedge to apprehend those who staged a series of at-
 tacks against a dozen nonapostolic religious groups in 1995, the authorities have
 made no arrests. No attacks were reported in 1996.
 d. Freedom of Mooerent Within the Count,. Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-aThe Constitutionprovides for freedom of movement within the country,
 foreign travel, emigration, and repatriation, but the Government places restrictions
 on some of these rights. According to informed estimates, up to one-third of the pop-
 ulation has temporarily or permanently emigrated during the last 7 years. Travel
 passports may be denied to persons possessing state secrets and to those whose rel-
 atives have made financial claims against them. The Office of Visas and Registra-
 tions (OVIR) has eased travel and emigration procedures by discontinuing the re-
 quirement for exit visas. The Government publicly appeals to Armenians who have
 emigrated to return, and a small flow of repatriates has begun. The Government
 does not restrict internal movement; citizens have the right to change freely their
 residence or work place.
 The 1988-89 anti-Armenian pogroms in Azerbaijan caused an exchange of popu-
 lations between the two republics. The ethnic minorities on both sides were subject
 to discrimination and intimidation, often accompanied by violence intended to drive
 them from the country. All of the ethnic Azeris living in Armenia at the time, some
 185,000 persons, fled to Azerbai an. Of the 400,000 ethnic Armenians then living
 in Azerbaijan, 330,000 fled to an were granted refugee status in Armenia. The ma-
 jority of the rest took refuge in Russia with small numbers remaining in Azerbaijan.
 Armenia is a signatory to the 1951 U.N. Convention on Refugees and its 1967
 Protocol. The National Assembly passed a Law on Citizenship, Article 10 of which
 provides for refugees to gin citizenship, provided they are stateless and have re-
 sided in the country for the past 3 years. Implementing regulations for the law and
 naturalization procedures are being worked out with the United Nations High Com-
 missioner for Refugees. The status of those who remain refgees will continue to
 be unclear until a Law on Refugees is passed. Currently, there is a 5-year state pro-
 gram on refugees (1994-1999). The program's goal is to help the refugees integrate
 into the community. This program deals exclusively with refugees of Armenian na-
 tionality who have fled states in the region.
 The Government cooperates with the Office of the UNHCR and other humani-
 tarian organizations in assisting refugees. The Government provides first asylum
 and provided it to fewer than 50 persons in 1996. There were no reports of forced
 return of persons to a country where they feared persecution.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The Government's manipulation of the presidential election continued to restrict
 the Constitutional ability of citizens to change their government peacefully.
 The outcome of the September presidential elections, in which incumbent Presi-
 dent Ter-Petrossian officially was declared the victor in the first round of balloting
 with 51.75 percent, was contested by his leading challenger Vazgen Manukyan, who
 officially garnered 41.29 percent of the vote. Fifty percent of the vote by one can-
 didate was required to avoid a second round of elections. Manukyan's National Alli-
 ance filed an appeal to the Constitutional Court. An OSCE election observer mission
 noted "irregularities," "discrepancies," and "very serious breaches of the election
 law" which caused "concern for the overall integrity of the election process." The
 final report of the OSCE mission concluded that the breaches in the election law
 "can oniy' contribute to a lack of onfidene in the integrity of the overall election
 process.  Specific problems during the election process included intimidation; unau-
 thorized persons in polling stations; irregularities in military voting, especially in-
 structions by officers to troops on their voting choice; vote tabulation; verification;
 and the aggregation of results. Local organizations that observed the 1995 par-
 liamentary elections were not explicitly permitted to observe under the new presi-
 dential electoral law. Citing the law's silence, the CEC refused to allow such observ-
 ers.
 In response to the official election results, opposition candidates Manukyan and
 Manucharian claimed fraud and appealed directly to the Constitutional Court in
 late October for new elections. The Court upheld the official election results in late
 November. Major questions were raised regarding the Court's procedures in this
 
 
 case. The Central Election Commission refused requests by the opposition and inter-
 national experts to release the detailed election protocols (voting results) from all
 voting precincts. The Constitutional Court denied the opposition's request to publish
 all precinct results nationwide, confining its review to those precinct results pre-
 sented by the appellants; 1,155 of a total of 1,596 precinct results were reviewed.
 To protest this and other aspects of the Court's treatment of their case, the opposi-
 tion walked out of the Court's proceedings prior to its ruling. The Court's decision
 rejecting the opposition's appeal did not dispel doubts about the credibility of the
 official election results.
 Although the Presidential election was flawed, observers agreed that the conduct
 of the preelection campaign--excluding opposition party media access-was an im-
 provement over the 1995 parliamentary elections. All candidates with sufficient sig-
 natures were registered by the CEC. Opposition representatives participated as mi-
 nority members of electoral commissions in all regional and most precinct and com-
 munity levels. The opposition campaigned effectively and drew an impressive re-
 sponse from the voters. Checks and balances were enacted into law, which, if imple-
 mented, might have addressed many of the suspicions about vote manipulation.
 Multiple irregularities in the balloting and tabulation process undermined the credi-
 bility of the vote and remain a problem. The Government's failure to address effec-
 tively these flaws eroded public confidence in the integrity of the electoral process
 and remains a source of deep polarization within the country.
 Under the Constitution, the President appoints the Prime Minister and has con-
 siderable influence in appointing judges. The Constitution provides for independent
 legislative and judicial branches, but in practice these branches are not insulated
 from political pressure from the executive branch.
 The Government appoints the 10 regional governors (marzpets). The Constitution
 gives local communities the right to elect local authorities. In November the first
 elections for municipal councils and mayors were held. The municipal elections were
 also characterized by extensive irregularities, notwithstanding the initial observa-
 tion by Council of Europe observers that elections were "free and fair" at the pre-
 cincts that they visited. In addition some opposition parties officially boycotted the
 elections in protest over the conduct of the presidential elections.
 The National Assembly is to operate as a part-time institution for the duration
 of its first term. Approximately one-third of the parliamentarians have been des-
 ignated full-time deputies. Parliament also has a truncated work schedule for its
 first term. Sessions may be called, but may not last more than 6 days.
 There are no legal restrictions on the participation of women and minorities in
 government and politics. However, due to traditional social attitudes, both are
 underrepresented in all branches of government. There is one woman in Cabinet
 (Minister of Social Welfare), but no minorities. Only 11 of the 190 deputies in the
 Parliament are women.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 There are several fledgling nongovernmental human rights organizations that are
 active and operate openly, criticizing publicly and publishing their findings on gov-
 ernment human rights violations. The Government at times impeded investigations
 into alleged violations of human rights by international human rights organizations.
 The Government accepted an OSCE election observer mission for its presidential
 elections and provided international observers with countrywide access. However,
 local observer organizations, which had been given access during the 1995 par-
 liamentary elections, were not allowed to observe the presidential erections (see  c-
 tion 3).
 The Government was generally cooperative in granting the ICRC access to pris-
 oners of war and civilian detainees held by Armenia in connection with the
 Nagorno-Karabakh conflict. Prisoners on the ICRC lists were released in a prisoner
 exchange in May. The ICRC was also provided access to detainees facing politically
 motivated charges in connection with the "Dro,"  Trial of 31," and other cases. How-
 ever, the ICRC had significant difficulties in meeting with the prisoners detained
 by the Ministry of Interior following the government crackdown in September after
 the presidential election (see Section 1.c.).
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 Discrimination based on race, sex, religion, disability, language, or social status
 is prohibited by the Constitution, but cultural and economic factors prevent women,
 ethnic and religious minorities, and persons with disabilities from participating fully
 in public life.
 
 
 835
 Women.-The Legal Code (the old Soviet code) cites specific punishments for rape,
 forced abortion, forbidding a woman from marrying, and discrimination in hiring
 due to pregnancy. There is no specific law banning violence against women. Few
 cases of rap, spouse abuse, or other violence against women are reported in this
 conservative, patriarchal society, although their number is likely higher than the
 statistics indicate. Between January and September, the Interior Miistry reg-
 istered 32 cases of rape and attempted rape.
 In the workplace, women receive equal pay for equal work, but are generally not
 afforded the same professional opportunities given to men and are often relegated
 to mere menial or low-skill jobs. The 1992 law on employment prohibits discrimina-
 tion in employment, but the extremely high unemployment rate makes it difficult
 to gauge how effectively the law has been implemented to prevent discrimination.
 Currently there are more women receiving university and postgraduate education
 than men.
 Children.-The Government does not have the economic means to provide fully
 for the welfare of children. The family tradition is strong, and child abuse does not
 appear to be a serious problem. The Government focuses its efforts on children's
 rights and welfare with measures to insulate large families-four or more children-
 from the effects of the country's current difficult circumstances. The Government
 similarly tarets foreign humanitarian aid programs at large families.
 Girls and boys receive equal educational educational opportunities as education
 is highly prized for both men and women.
 People With Disabilities.-The Constitution provides for right to social security in
 the event of disability. The 1993 Law on Invalids provides for the social, political,
 and individual rights of the disabled but does not mandate the provision of acces-
 sibility for the disabled. In its current economic circumstances, the Government has
 difficulty making good on its commitments in this area. The Government's enforce-
 ment of the rights of the disabled remains rudimentary. There is societal discrimi-
 nation against the disabled.
 Religious Minorities.-In June the Catholicos of all Armenians, Karekin I, who
 heads the Armenian Apostolic Church, received a large delegation of the Armenian
 Evangelical Church (AEC), which is the second largest Armenian religious body.
 The two set in motion a new ecumenical spirit that had been lacking since the AEC
 was established 150 years ago. This process is expanding to include Orthodox-
 Protestant cooperation in religious education. Although minority religious groups,
 especially new religious movements, are not widely accepted in society, there was
 no violence against minority religious groups.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-The Government does not discriminate
 against the small communities of Russians, Jews, Kurds, Yezids, Georgians, Greeks,
 and Assyrians in employment, housing, or health services. Following the protracted
 conflict (see Section 2.d.), there is no significant Azeri minority. There are several
 hundred Azeris or persons of mixed Azeri heritage still living in Armenia, but they
 are isolated from one another and maintain a low profile. Although there have been
 no reported cases of persecution, they face societal discrimination.
 The Constitution grants national minorities the right to preserve their cultural
 traditions and language, and the 1992 law on language provides linguistic minori-
 ties the right to publish and study in their native language. There are publications
 in minority languages, but the Government has not devoted sufficient resources to
 organizing minority language schools. In practice, virtually everyone, including
 members of the Yezid, Greek, and Jewish communities, speaks Armenian. There are
 no known allegations of persecution based on minority group among the non-Azeri
 minority groups.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution provides employees with the right
 to form and join trade unions and the right to strike. The Constitution stipulates
 that the right to form associations-including political parties and trade unions-
 may be limited with respect to persons serving in the armed services and law en-
 forcement agencies. A 1993 presidential decree prohibits the Government and other
 employers from retaliating against strikers and labor leaders. Injpractice labor orga-
 nization remains weak due to high unemployment and stalled industry.
 Unions are free to affiliate with international organizations.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Collective bargaining is not
 practiced. The Constitution provides all citizens with the right to a just wage no
 lower than the minimum set by the Government. Although the 1992 Law on Em-
 ployment provides for the right to organize and bargain collectively, voluntary and
 direct negotiations do not take place between unions and employers without the par-
 ticipation of the Government because nearly all enterprises, factories, and organiza-
 
 
 836
 tions remain under state control. The near collapse of major industrial production
 has undercut the organization of labor unions.
 The Government encourages profitable factories to establish their own pay scales.
 Factory directorates generally set the pay scales, without consultation with employ-
 ees, Wage and other labor disputes are adjudicated through the Arbitration Court.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Constitution and the 1992 law
 on employment prohibit forced labor, and it is not practiced. This prvision is en-
 forcd by the local councils of deputies, unemployment offices, and, as a final board
 of appeal, the Arbitration Commission.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-Child labor is not practiced. Ac-
 cording to the 1992 Law on Employment, 16 years is the minimum age for employ-
 ment. Children may work from the age of 14 with the permission of a medical com-
 mission and the relevant labor union board. The Law on Employment is enforced
 by the local councils of deputies, unemployment offices, and, as a final board of ap-
 peal, the Arbitration Commission.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The Government sets the minimum wage by
 decree. In July the national minimum wage was set at $2 dollars (820 drams) per
 month. The standard legal workweek is 41 hours.
 Given the cost of living, employees paid the minimum wage cannot support either
 themselves or their families on their pay alone. The overwhelming majority of the
 population lives below the officially recognized poverty level as a result of the eco-
 nomic dislocations caused by the breakup of the Soviet Union, the 1988 earthquake,
 the conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh, and the resulting blockade and disruptions in
 trade. The vast majority of enterprises are either idle or operating at only a fraction
 of their capacity. Some furloughed workers are still receiving minimal partial com-
 pensation from their enterprises, but most are no longer receiving any payment if
 they are not working.
 The Constitution provides citizens with the right to clean and safe work places,
 but Soviet-era occupational and safety standards remain in force. Labor legislation
 from 1988 places responsibility on the employer and the management of each firm
 to ensure "healthy and normal" labor conditions for employees, but it provides no
 definition of healthy and normal. The employment situation is such that workers
 would be afraid of the risk of losing their jobs and, therefore, it is unlikely that they
 would attempt to remove themselves from hazardous working conditions.
