 CHINA
 
 China is ruled by the Communist Party, which is headed by a small
 elite group dominated by Politburo Standing Committee member Deng
 Xiaoping. The party reserves to itself all power to decide
 political and economic policy and also sees itself as the final
 arbiter of social, cultural, and moral questions. When it achieved
 power in 1949, the party inherited a country with a long tradition
 of authoritarian rule. The party has built upon this tradition but
 has justified it with the Leninist doctrine of party control and
 considerably strengthened it through the use of all the
 instrumentalities available to the modern totalitarian state.
 The experience of the 1966-76 Cultural Revolution--in which the
 populace (including most of the present leadership) was victimized
 by repeated, violent mass campaigns and the country was in a state
 of virtual anarchy--has apparently intensified the desire for order
 and stability. The leadership appeals to this desire in describing
 any potential threat to its own control as a threat to social order
 and in justifying a strong reaction to perceived challenges, whether
 from political dissidents or from the import of foreign attitudes
 and ideas. Since the death of Mao Zedong and the fall of his
 radical supporters, the "Gang of Four,* in 1976, the Chinese system
 has entered a period of transition and experimentation. The party
 has reasserted central civilian authority--weakened during the
 Cultural Revolution--and the principle of collective leadership
 undermined by years of Mao's domination.
 Today, power within the party is divided among a group of top
 leaders in several key organizations, including the Politburo and
 its Standing Committee, the Secretariat, and the Military
 Commission. Politburo Standing Committee member Deng Xiaoping, who
 is also chairman of the military commissions of both the party and
 the state and Chairman of the Party's Central Advisory Commission,
 holds a dominant position among these leaders. While arguing their
 policies in terms of Marxist-Leninist ideology and the writings of
 Mao Zedong, China's leaders state that these doctrines must be
 adapted to Chinese realities and that ideological tenets must be
 applied in the light of current conditions. This policy has
 resulted in a repudiation of some aspects of the Soviet economic
 model unsuited to Chinese conditions. The new policies,
 particularly in agriculture, are aimed at rewarding individual
 initiative, while preserving the framework of a centrally planned
 economy.
 Over one billion Chinese, about one-fourth of the world's
 population, are crowded onto just seven percent of the world's
 arable land. Although incomes have risen rapidly in recent years,
 China remains a poor country, whose 1982 per capita Gross Domestic
 Product of around $258 ranks in the bottom quarter of developing
 countries. China's leaders have declared economic development to be
 the nation's top priority, with emphasis on the production of farm
 products and consumer goods. As an integral part of the
 modernization drive, China has instituted an "open door* policy of
 expanded foreign trade and investment.
 Economic progress in the post-Cultural Revolution period has been
 accompanied by a mixed trend in political development. As part of
 the cautious efforts to restore the legal system abandoned during
 the Cultural Revolution and to replace arbitrary and capricious
 decisionmaking with the orderly procedures of law, the leadership
 has promulgated a criminal law, code of criminal procedure, and
 provisional civil procedure law--the first large-scale codification
 of law in the history of modern China. The new state Constitution,
 adopted in 1982, provides the formal structure for dispersal of
 political power and official guarantees of individual
 
 (740)
 
 
 741
 rights; however, it dropped some of the guarantees of rights
 contained in the 1978 Constitution. While not relinquishing its
 decisionmaking authority, the party has made a gesture towards
 broader participation in the political process through
 reinvigoration of such institutions as the National People's
 Congress and the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference
 and by conducting multicandidate local elections in 1980 and 1981.
 The party remains opposed to religion and officially atheist but has
 in recent years adopted a policy of limited religious toleration,
 under which religious activities have shown remarkable vitality and
 growth as places of worship have reopened for the first time since
 they were closed in the 1960's.
 The overall trend towards a less tightly controlled society since
 the Cultural Revolution has been reflected in increased contacts
 with the outside, with tens of thousands of Chinese traveling abroad
 to study, conduct business, or visit relatives, while millions of
 overseas Chinese and hundreds of thousands of other foreigners have
 visited China annually. Emigration controls have also loosened
 considerably. Cultural life, while closely monitored by the party,
 has become somewhat more lively in the last few years and features
 many types of entertainment that are devoid of political content,
 although the range of permitted expression has again been narrowed
 since 1979-81.
 On the other hand, there remain significant strictures on individual
 rights and freedoms. The regime does not tolerate criticism of the
 party's political role or of the fundamental structure of the
 Communist system, and it limits political debate. Critics who go
 beyond these limits to fault basic concepts are dealt-with swiftly
 and sometimes harshly. During the period from spring 1979 through
 1981, dissidents were rounded up and imprisoned for publicly
 challenging the established order. This ended the brief
 post-Cultural Revolution relaxation in the party's tight control of
 political dissent, and the public expression of antagonistic points
 of view ceased almost entirely. Many of these dissidents were
 reportedly detained for periods of over a year before being tried
 in closed sessions and then convicted of "counterrevolutionary"
 activities. The authorities have sometimes sentenced such critics
 to "reeducation through labor.' Under this administrative procedure
 intended to punish "minor theft or fraud,* suspects may be deprived
 of liberty without trial for periods of up to four years.
 The party also remains very sensitive to foreign influence on the
 thinking of the Chinese populace. Chinese contacts with foreigners
 are monitored by an extensive formal and informal security
 apparatus. Chinese not related to foreigners and those whose
 occupations do not require such contacts may be warned or, in
 extreme cases, arrested if they persist in such contacts.
 In 1983, confronted by the failure of anticrime campaigns in the
 previous two years, the authorities inaugurated a new coordinated
 nationwide crime suppression campaign in 1983. The leadership
 revised the code of criminal procedure to increase the number of
 crimes punishable by death and impose the death penalty more
 rapidly. There are credible reports that, at the outset of the
 campaign in August, arrest quotas were assigned to provinces and
 municipalities, and wholesale roundups of suspected criminal
 elements occurred. Many of those accused of involvement in gang
 activity had their urban residency permits cancelled and were
 expelled to remote areas such as Qinghai for 'reeducation through
 labor.' Often, those convicted
 
 
 742
 of capital crimes were publicly denounced at large rallies before
 being executed. Estimates of the number arrested run upwards of
 100,000, of whom perhaps 3,000 to 5,000 were executed.
 While the crime suppression campaign was aimed primarily at ordinary
 criminals, a small number of document smugglers and others not
 normally classifiable as common criminals continued to be arrested
 and in some cases executed. Representatives of the Dalai Lama
 alleged in September that five Tibetan dissidents were to be
 executed and that 1,500 others had been arrested. The Chinese
 Government confirmed that two ethnic Tibetans had been executed,
 along with four Chinese residents of Tibet, but said that they had
 been convicted of specific, non-political crimes as part of the
 nationwide crime suppression campaign. Well-placed observers
 considered the reports of 1,500 arrests to have been exaggerated,
 but various persons were arrested in Tibet for alleged 'counter-
 revolutionary activities,* including some Tibetans who had passed
 petitions critical of Chinese control of Tibet to foreign
 journalists visiting Lhasa earlier in the year.
 Certain areas of cultural activity and intellectual debate came
 under attack in October when the authorities launched a drive to
 eliminate 'cultural contamination.' Party officials criticized
 ideological and literary works which manifested Western liberal
 views, which questioned the Communist system and party leadership,
 or which had degraded the morals of Chinese youth by introducing
 "pornography.* By the end of 1983, Chinese leaders were stressing
 that the drive should be aimed only at key activities undermining
 party leadership or social order.
 In June, the President of the Supreme People's Court announced that
 the trials of 'Gang of Four" supporters had been completed, but some
 trials continued. The authorities announced the convictions of nine
 of ten persons accused of being Gang followers; they were sentenced
 to terms of up to 18 years. As for the "Gang of Four," two
 members--Jiang Qing and Zhang Chunqiao--had their death sentences
 commuted to life imprisonment. In the fall, the party leadership
 announced an 'internal rectification' campaign to rid the party of
 "deviant" and unqualified members but stressed that the campaign
 would be conducted in an orderly manner without excesses such as
 those which took place during the Cultural Revolution.
 Religious activities continued to expand with the opening of new
 theological seminaries and places of worship. On the other hand,
 believers are usually excluded from the party (in Muslim areas such
 is not the case), and most of them exercise restraint in propagating
 their faith and in their contacts with foreign religious
 organizations. Four elderly Chinese priests, who professed loyalty
 to the Vatican and had been detained since 1981, were sentenced for
 subversion to prison terms of up to 15 years.
 Li Shuang, a dissident engaged to a French diplomat, was released
 after completing a two-year sentence of *reeducation through labor'
 and permitted to join her fiance in Paris.
 The Ministry of Civil Affairs announced in August that applications
 for marriages between foreigners and Chinese, with a few specific
 exceptions (diplomats, military personnel, and others involved in
 .confidential and important work," as well as those serving prison
 terms), would be approved within one month if they were in accord
 with Chinese marriage law. This regulation formalized unpublished
 
 
 743
 guidelines, which had previously been obstructed by lower levels
 of the bureaucracy.
 In China there is considerable regulation of personal and family
 life, for both political and economic reasons. Faced with a severe
 problem of population growth, the authorities have set minimum ages
 for marriage and quotas for children born in each province. When
 implemented locally, these quotas have resulted in strong pressures
 on those who become pregnant outside the plan. In some cases, women
 have undergone forced abortions (sometimes in the later stages of
 pregnancy) in contradiction to stated government policy. Chinese
 are not allowed to change their place of residence or workplace
 without permission from the authorities.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section I Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Unlawful or Arbitrary Deprivation of Life
 It is estimated that 3,000 to 5,000 persons were executed with few
 legal safeguards during the anticrime campaign. To facilitate this
 campaign, the National People's Congress Standing Committee in
 September amended the code of criminal procedures to increase the
 number of crimes punishable by death and to allow the death penalty
 to be imposed more speedily. Removal of previous procedural
 requirements drastically reduced defendants' opportunities for
 preparing their defense or appealing decisions and also permitted
 execution as little as eight days after commission of a crime. For
 instance, the code was amended to remove a previous stipulation that
 the accused must receive a copy of the indictment at least seven
 days before the trial began.
 Persons convicted during the anticrime campaign were often taken
 before "mass sentencing meetings' attended by thousands of people.
 The largest publicized meeting was held in Beijing's main sports
 stadium in August with 100,000 persons in attendance. After those
 who had been convicted confessed or were publicly denounced at such
 meetings, in many cases they were sentenced-to death. They were
 then paraded through the city with placards around their necks
 specifying their crimes, before they were executed by firing
 squads. While most persons executed during the anticrime campaign
 were common criminals, at least five persons were executed as
 'Taiwan spies," and there were reports of other executions on
 charges such as "counterrevolutionary' activities.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no known instances in 1983 of individuals being abducted
 or disappearing without a trace as a result of actions by the
 security authorities.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Official policy and law forbid the use of torture, and there were no
 known reports of torture in 1983. During the anticrime campaign,
 however, there was public denunciation and humiliation of those
 convicted of serious crimes, particularly capital offenses.
 
 30-231 0 - 84 - 48
 
 
 744
 Inmates in penal institutions are expected to work, and penal
 authorities have indicated that the value of their labor is
 sufficient to pay the expenses of their incarceration. In prisons
 visited by foreigners with official sanction, inmates live in a
 crowded but sanitary environment. In penal labor camps, some
 located in remote areas of China, conditions probably vary widely.
 There have been reports of beatings and of restrictions on letters
 and family visits.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 China's 1979 code of criminal procedure provides that public
 security offices must have warrants when detaining suspects. Within
 three days after an arrest, the public security office is to submit
 to the prosecutor's office a request for approval of the action.
 The code states that the public security office may detain a suspect
 for two months during its investigation, but adds that this period
 may be extended with the approval of higher authorities. In
 practice, suspects may be detained indefinitely until the public
 security office concludes its investigation. After the public
 security office has forwarded the results of its investigation to
 the prosecutor, the latter has one month to decide whether or not to
 prosecute, although this period may also be extended. There is no
 provision for preventive detention. Suspects may be released in the
 custody of guarantors or allowed to return home under surveillance.
 Criminal defendants have the right to counsel, but a defense
 attorney normally does not enter the case until after the police and
 prosecutor have completed their investigations and the defendant has
 been indicted. Chinese law also provides that a detained person
 should be released at the request of himself or his family, if the
 police have not followed proper arrest procedures. However, this
 stipulation is seldom observed in practice.
 The 1983 Amnesty International report on China details the cases of
 several dozen dissidents arrested between 1978 and 1981 who were
 detained for periods of over a year before being tried. According
 to the report, these individuals, including Xu Wenli, Wang Xizhe,
 Sun Weibang, Fu Shenqi, and Liu Er'an, were typically charged with
 .counterrevolutionary* activity. Individuals have reportedly been
 held incommunicado following arrest and their whereabouts not
 divulged. The authorities, however, eventually confirm arrests to
 family members.
 Under 'labor education' provisions, those who commit 'minor theft or
 fraud" or who have been expelled from their work units may be
 deprived of their civil liberties and subjected to *reeducation
 through labor" for up to four years without trial. This nonjudicial
 sentencing procedure has been used frequently against political
 dissidents. Judgments are handed down by a public security office
 in consultation with representatives of local civil affairs units.
 The authorities made extensive use of this provision during the
 crime suppression campaign to round up alleged hooligans. The
 authorities also used the authority to cancel urban residency
 permits of recidivists, thus exiling large numbers of city
 
 
 745
 dwellers to remote areas. In many cases persons sent to remote
 areas for 'reeducation through labor" are unable upon completion of
 their terms to renew their residency permits in their cities of
 origin and are consequently forced to remain in exile near the labor
 camps.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 In practice, most Chinese trials are merely sentencing hearings
 where defense representatives plead for clemency for their clients
 whose guilt, with very few exceptions, is not contested. The trials
 are preceded by extensive pretrial investigation and corroboration
 of testimony, and it is assumed that any individual who is brought
 to trial is guilty. Chinese authorities have indicated that the
 conviction rate of those tried for criminal offenses is about 98
 percent.
 Defendants in criminal cases may appeal both verdicts and sentences
 to the next higher level courts, normally the provincial higher
 court. In the few cases about which there is credible information,
 appeals have resulted in stiffer as well as reduced sentences for
 the accused.
 There are no standing special political or security courts aside
 from a special court created to handle the "Gang of Four" trial.
 In practice the party stage-manages trials having political
 significance, such as the 'Gang of Four" trial and followup trials
 involving 'Gang" supporters.
 The criminal procedure code requires that all trials be held in
 public, except those involving state secrets, juveniles, and
 .personal secrets." In practice, attendance at public trials
 requires an admission ticket obtained from organizations selected by
 the authorities.
 There are no precise estimates of the number of persons imprisoned
 for their political beliefs, but the number may be in the
 thousands. Estimates of the number of prisoners held in labor camps
 in recent years have run to over 100,000, but the population
 diminished significantly in recent years both because of the
 .reversal of verdicts" of hundreds of thousands of political
 prisoners sentenced during the Cultural Revolution and also because
 of natural attrition. The 1983 crime suppression campaign has,
 however, raised the inmate population, as tens of thousands of
 common criminals and persons considered socially undesirable were
 sent to the camps.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home or
 Correspondence
 The authorities view control over cultural, intellectual, religious,
 and family life as proper. Literary, scholary, and artistic works
 are supposed to advance socially desirable themes as determined by
 the leadership. There is, however, debate between various groups
 within the elite. Personnel in 'street committees" in cities and
 production brigades in rural areas monitor the lives of residents of
 their apartment building or village and may report misbehavior to
 the authorities.
 The criminal procedure code requires the use of search warrants for
 gathering evidence. There is no reliable information on whether
 this proviso is carried out in practice. There have been some
 reports of the use of electronic eavesdropping and monitoring of
 correspondence of suspected political dissidents.
 
 
 746
 Faced with a severe population problem, the authorities have
 instituted various controls on marriage and childbearing. Effective
 in 1983, the minimum legal age for marriage was 24 for men and 20
 for women--high by world standards but lower than previous
 requirements. Each province sets guidelines for the desired number
 of children to be born during the year. These guidelines often
 become translated into rigid quotas at lower level units such as
 factories and communes. In such units, women must apply for
 permission to have a child. Those becoming pregnant outside the
 .plan' are subject to peer pressure, harassment, and sometimes
 economic penalties and in many cases are forced to have abortions,
 even in late stages of pregnancy.
 Chinese citizens cannot freely change their locality of residence or
 their workplace. They are registered as residents of a particular
 jurisdiction, and the authorities normally grant permission to move
 to another locality only because of a change in the resident's
 employment. In turn, shifting one's workplace is difficult since
 both the sending and receiving work units must give their approval.
 There are many examples of Chinese working couples living apart
 (except for holiday visits) because they are unable to get
 permission needed from the various bureaucracies involved, such as
 work units and public security offices, to live in the same
 locality. City-dwelling Chinese who were sent to remote rural areas
 during the Cultural Revolution period have sometimes found it
 difficult to obtain permission to return.
 The Ministry of Civil Affairs announced in August that applications
 for marriages between foreigners and Chinese will be approved in one
 month if the ceremony will take place in China and conform to the
 marriage law. In effect this formalizes the previous unstated
 policy, which had been subject, however, to obstruction at lower
 bureaucratic levels. The new regulation also prohibits persons
 involved in *confidential and other important work' (such as
 diplomats and military personnel), as well as those serving prison
 sentences, from marrying foreigners.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution guarantees freedom of speech and the press but
 specifies that exercise of these and other freedoms may not infringe
 upon the interests of the state or society. In practice, open
 criticism of party rule and the socialist system as implemented in
 China is not tolerated. The 1979-81 suppression of unofficial
 publications virtually eliminated the publication of dissident
 views. The Communist Party exercises strict control over the print
 and broadcast media. Many periodicals and newspapers are published
 by the party, and all others are published by groups subject to
 party direction, such as the "mass organizations".
 Pointed criticism of improper policy implementation by government
 and party officials--usually low or middle ranking--is permitted
 for many newspapers. Such criticism is, however, assumed to be
 sanctioned by the party prior to publication. 'Letters to the
 Editor" columns are popular features used by the party to permit
 ordinary citizens to expose incidents of alleged injustice and
 corruption, within limits set by the party. Newspapers maintain
 their own investigative staffs to seek corrective action for
 
 
 747
 complaints raised in these letters. These investigations have
 sometimes led to punishment of corrupt or inept officials.
 The first half of 1983 was marked by the appearance of poems, plays,
 movies, and short stories which addressed contemporary themes with
 greater realism and less ideological rigidity than in the recent
 past. Sensitive themes such as the recounting of past party
 excesses were permitted so long as they remained within certain
 limits loosely set by officials.
 In addition to Chinese drama and literature, Beijing audiences were
 able to enjoy Chinese-language renditions of Shakespeare,
 contemporary Western plays such as Arthur Miller's "Death of a
 Salesman,* and operas like 'La Boheme.'  By the end of 1983,
 however, official calls for an attack on cultural contamination' by
 non-Marxist influences raised some doubts as to whether this trend
 would continue.
 Access to foreign books and artistic works is sharply limited by the
 authorities, although more such books have become available than in
 the past. Foreigners living in China receive materials by
 subscription or can purchase them locally with foreign exchange.
 For foreigners, access to foreign periodicals is only rarely
 interrupted, as in the case this year of a Time magazine issue with
 a cover story on China, banned from local newscounters but delivered
 to subscribers. Foreign periodicals and magazines are available to
 selected Chinese, primarily in universities. Tens of millions of
 Chinese read the Reference News, an officially-controlled selection
 of largely uncensored translations from the foreign press. Chinese
 listen freely to foreign broadcasts such as the "Voice of America"
 (VOA), and many universities use VOA and other foreign radio
 programs in their language courses. There is no jamming.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Constitution guarantees the rights of assembly and association,
 but in practice these rights are severely circumscribed. China has
 a great number of professional and other types of associations, such
 as the Chinese Writers' Association, the All-China Youth Federation,
 the All-China Women's Federation, and the All-China Sports
 Federation. These groups operate with official sanction and in
 nearly all cases are controlled by a party committee within the
 particular association.
 Although contacts between Chinese and foreigners have increased
 considerably since 1978 with growing numbers of businessmen,
 tourists, teachers, and students coming to China, the authorities
 closely scrutinize such association.
 Chinese citizens whose work does not require or permit contact with
 foreigners may be warned or, in extreme cases, detained if they
 persist in meeting foreign acquaintances. Some of the Tibetans who
 approached foreign journalists visiting Lhasa in August, to give
 them petitions to the U.N. protesting Chinese control of Tibet, were
 later reported to have been arrested.
 The trade union structure is controlled by the Communist Party. The
 new trade union constitution adopted in 1983 states that unions
 function independently but adds that they are subject to party
 
 
 748
 leadership and policies. With 73 million members, the All-China
 Federation of Trade Unions enrolls about two-thirds of the nation's
 urban work force. The Federation's primary function is to promote
 labor discipline, enhance productivity, conduct ideological and
 political indoctrination, and improve workers' educational and
 technical level. Unions also perform a variety of social and
 welfare functions such as operating eating facilities, nurseries,
 schools, and sanatoriums. Although the Federation chairman, who is
 also a Politburo member, called on unions in October to participate
 in the determination of wage rates, unions do not engage in
 collective bargaining. Like the 1982 state Constitution which
 eliminated the 1978 Constitution's specific mention of a right to
 strike, the new trade union constitution omits any reference to that
 right. Speaking at the Tenth Trade Union Congress in October, a
 trade union spokesman said that this omission did not necessarily
 mean strikes were illegal and described a narrow range of instances
 where they might be permitted for a brief time. Many observers
 believed these remarks were aimed at a foreign audience rather than
 for domestic consumption. In the international sphere, China began
 in 1983 active participation in the International Labor
 Organization, and the Federation expressed its desire to have
 friendly relations with foreign trade unions regardless of whether
 they were affiliated with the International Confederation of Free
 Trade Unions or the World Federation of Trade Unions. By October
 1983, the Chinese Federation claimed to have friendly relations with
 trade unions in 120 countries or regions.
 The Chinese leadership has also promoted the formation of workers'
 congresses to permit workers to play a role in enterprise management
 and to select plant officials. Over 200,000 of China's 389,000
 enterprises, including most large and medium size factories, are now
 said to have workers' congresses. All candidates for office in
 these bodies require party approval. Even party journals admit that
 most of these workers' congresses exist in name only and have yet to
 become involved in enterprise management.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 China's 1982 Constitution grants the people freedom of religious
 belief and specifies that no organization or individual may compel
 citizens to believe or disbelieve in religion or discriminate
 against them because of their religious preference. The
 Constitution offers protection for 'legitimate religious activities'
 but proscribes those which 'disrupt social order, impair the health
 of citizens, or interfere with the state educational system.' The
 Constitution also provides that religious bodies and affairs must
 not be subject to foreign domination.
 Atheism is part of the program of the Chinese Communist party and
 members are in principle expelled for religious affiliation. In
 practice, low-ranking members sometimes may engage in religious
 worship informally. Persons with known religious beliefs are
 normally not allowed to join the Communist Party, and thus are
 excluded from many of the material, career, and other benefits which
 accrue to party members; this exerts a strong pressure against
 religious commitment. Aside from these provisions, official policy
 forbids religiods proselytizing outside places of worship or
 believers' homes. According to unpublished regulations, religious
 freedom applies only to persons over 18. In theory, religious
 
 
 749
 instruction of minors is forbidden, and they are discouraged from
 attending religious activities. In some areas, authorities do in
 fact actively discourage persons under 18 from attending religious
 services. However, this policy is widely ignored particularly in
 minority areas, where religion is an integral part of daily life.
 Chinese authorities periodically criticize 'feudal superstitious
 activities,* a description which appears to encompass many
 traditional Buddhist and Daoist practices but does not appear to be
 directed at Christian and Muslim activities.
 The authorities have required all religious bodies to affiliate
 with eight national organizations representing four religions--
 Christianity, Buddhism, Islam, and Daoism. The stated aim of this
 affiliation is to ensure that all religious bodies accept the
 leadership of the party and state. These groups include two
 Protestant associations (the Protestant Patriotic Three
 Self-Movement and the China Christian Council), three Catholic
 associations (the Patriotic Catholic Association, the National
 Administrative Commission of the Catholic Church, and the Catholic
 Bishops College), and one association for each of the other three
 religions.
 The Christian organizations have different functional purposes but
 overlapping leadership. Although there are five national Christian
 organizations, all legally-recognized Christian congregations must
 belong to one or two national churches, Catholic and Protestant.
 The Government requires Christians to register their religious
 preferences with local authorities who issue passes permitting them
 to enter churches. With its separation from Rome, the Chinese
 Catholic church has developed an independent theology and doctrines;
 for example, it rejects papal infallibility, continues to conduct
 services in Latin, and endorses the state's policy on birth control
 and abortion. All formerly separate Protestant denominations have
 been required to join the single Protestant church, although
 congregations and individuals may be allowed to follow their
 preferences on questions such as forms of baptism and Sunday or
 Saturday services, and both of the earlier Chinese Protestant
 versions of the Bible are in use. Some Christians continue to
 worship according to their traditional beliefs in unofficial or
 clandestine 'house churches' rather than join the official
 churches. Government efforts against 'house churches' continued in
 1983. There were unconfirmed reports of arrests of 30 'house
 church' leaders in central China, 100 Christians in Henan province,
 a number of Christians in Shaanxi province, and two ethnic Koreans
 active in the evangelical church movement in Shanghai. To promote
 the united front, the Chinese leadership includes religious figures
 as delegates to the Chinese People's Political Consultative
 Conference and the National People's Congress. In 1983, the new
 sessions of those bodies included an increased number of religious
 leaders, a sign, official spokesmen said, of the party's greater
 concern for religion.
 In this mixed environment of permissions and restrictions, religious
 activities have expanded rapidly in the last five years. In
 contrast to the Cultural Revolution period when all places of
 worship in Beijing (except for one mosque) were closed, there are
 now reportedly 400 functioning churches and over 20,000 mosques.
 Many Buddhist and Daoist temples have also been reopened, often
 after being refurbished with government funds. In Tibet, 45
 Lamaistic
 
 
 750
 monasteries have reportedly reopened, but this constitutes only a
 small fraction of the 2,000 to 3,000 monasteries open prior to the
 1959 Tibetan uprising, and the monasteries are open to the public
 only two days per week. The Tibetan spiritual leader, the Dalai
 Lama, remained in exile.
 Beginning in 1981, the authorities authorized the opening of
 seminaries to train the next generation of religious leaders. In
 1983, the Chinese Catholic Church established seminaries in Beijing
 and Wuhan to join the one already open in Shanghai. Other
 functioning theological institutes include Protestant seminaries in
 Nanjing and Shenyang, the Beijing National Islamic Theological
 Institute, and Buddhist institutes in Beijing, Suzhou, and Nanjing.
 Observers believe the number of Christians has increased since 1978,
 with estimates of their number ranging from the official figure of
 six million to a more likely l to 20 million. Officials say there
 are 15 million actively practicing Muslims and that practitioners of
 Buddhism and Daoism run in the millions. Despite Government
 assistance in returning many places of worship to religious
 associations, most pre-Cultural Revolution churches and temples
 remain occupied by factories, the military, and other units. This,
 plus the increasing number of believers, results in a severe
 shortage of churches and temples. With the older generation of
 religious leaders slowly dying off, there is also a growing shortage
 of priests, ministers, monks, and imams, and thus a pressing need
 for more seminaries.
 Because of traditional concern over divided loyalties, the Chinese
 authorities carefully monitor and control contacts between Chinese
 and foreign religious organizations. In 1983, several religious
 groups (mostly representing Buddhist and Islamic organizations)
 visited China, and some Chinese religious leaders made overseas
 trips. In addition, small groups of Chinese Muslims have made the
 pilgrimage to Mecca in recent years. The Chinese authorities
 nonetheless proclaim their religious organizations to be totally
 independent and warn against foreign attempts--particularly by the
 Vatican--to interfere in Chinese religious affairs.
 Government relations with the Vatican have continued to be chilled
 because of Rome's recognition of the Taiwan authorities as the legal
 government of China and because the officially sanctioned Chinese
 Catholic Church does not recognize the Vatican's authority. Four
 elderly Catholic priests loyal to the Vatican, who have been under
 detention in Shanghai for the last two years, were reportedly
 sentenced in 1983 to prison terms of up to 15 years for subversion.
 The 76-year-old Bishop of Baoding, Peter Joseph Fan, and his
 assistant, 70-year-old Father Chang Huopin, were reportedly
 sentenced to 10 years imprisonment in 1983 after having been under
 house arrest since 1982 for maintaining relations with the Vatican.
 Bishop Gong Pinmei, another prominent Catholic clergyman loyal to
 Rome, has been incarcerated since the 1950's. The Chinese
 authorities prohibit missionaries from practicing among the Chinese
 but have allowed some foreign clergymen to enter for short periods
 to serve the resident foreign community.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel
 Emigration, and Repatriation
 Travel within China is subject to numerous restrictions. Chinese
 citizens must have a written letter of introduction from their work
 
 
 751
 unit to buy airline tickets, secure hotel accommodations, or acquire
 ration coupons which allow them to purchase basic food items in
 areas outside their place of residence. Those traveling by rail who
 plan to stay with relatives need not obtain letters of introduction
 but still are required to register with local police during their
 visits. In practice, many Chinese citizens travel frequently within
 the country, and some ignore the bureaucratic requirements without
 any difficulty.
 Controls over travel abroad and emigration have relaxed
 significantly in the past few years. Tens of thousands of Chinese
 citizens go abroad each year to study, conduct business, or visit
 relatives. The U.S. Embassy and Consulates in China issued over
 16,000 non-immigrant visas in Fiscal Year 1983 and refused many
 thousands of other Chinese applicants who secured travel documents
 but failed to meet U.S. visa standards. During the same period,
 over 6,000 immigrant visas were issued in China, with 80,000
 applicants on the waiting list. Since normalization of U.S.-China
 relations in 1979, several hundred Chinese residents regarded as
 local citizens by the Chinese authorities have presented claims of
 American citizenship; in nearly all cases where their documentation
 is valid, they have been allowed to leave under Chinese
 documentation. The situation with regard to visits and emigration
 to other countries is similar, with variations related to the size
 of the country, the size of its Chinese community, and other
 factors. Despite the trend towards loosening controls on foreign
 travel, Chinese citizens cannot go abroad as a matter of right.
 Many who apply for passports are refused, although no statistics are
 available. Chinese permitted to leave the country, however, are
 allowed to return.
 There is no practice in China of revoking the citizenship of
 political dissidents. In fact, the Chinese authorities have
 welcomed the return for permanent residence of Chinese who had fled
 their homeland earlier in fear of Communist rule; defectors are also
 welcomed back for either brief visits or residence. An estimated
 seven million overseas Chinese, including political opponents of the
 regime, visit the China mainland annually for business or tourism.
 China has provided resettlement to large numbers of refugees, most
 of them ethnic Chinese from Southeast Asian countries. There have
 been two large waves: in the early 1960's, when 60,000 people fled
 Indonesia in the wake of anti-Chinese riots, and since 1977 with the
 resettlement of around 250,000 refugees from Vietnam and 3,000 from
 Laos. This latest flow has slowed considerably with only 2,200 new
 refugees reported in the first half of 1983. There were no known
 cases of repatriation of refugees, either forced or voluntary.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Parties or groups which oppose the Communist Party or its policies
 are not permitted. The Communist Party is the source of all
 political authority and the seat of decisionmaking in the country.
 Within the party, power is divided among a group of top leaders in
 several key organizations, including the Politburo and its
 six-member Standing Committee, the Secretariat, and the Military
 Commission. The party follows the doctrine of 'democratic
 centralism,' which means that policy is made by these few leaders at
 the top, after consultation within (and occasionally without) the
 party, and
 
 
 752
 transmitted downward. This doctrine demands strict discipline,
 so that political debate and conflict which transcend the
 narrow limits drawn by the leadership can take place only
 through informal mechanisms. Such mechanisms employed by those
 with party connections include the presentation of alternate
 points of view or criticism through thinly veiled allusions in
 the party-controlled press, selective enforcement of policies,
 exploitation of policy ambiguities and loopholes, the
 manipulation of news coverage, and informal and unpublicized
 debate on the occasion of party and governmental meetings, work
 conferences, etc. There has in the past been significant
 expression of differing views between groups in the party's top
 leadership.
 Beside the Communist Party, eight other parties exist in China
 and are represented in the National People's Congress and the
 Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. These
 small groups do not seek to compete with the Communist Party
 and do not fill the role of an opposition. Although they can
 make recommendations, they have no real effect on political,
 economic, or social decisions, and function at best as a
 sounding board foc new policies under consideration by the
 Communist Party. The principal rationale for their existence
 is their role as part of the Communist Party's United Front
 Program to show the unity of the Chinese people under its
 leadership. To this end, the CCP increased the parties'
 representation in the Congress and Conference in 1983.
 China's National People's Congress meets once a year for about
 two weeks to debate and approve Government policies determined
 in advance by the Communist Party. The Congress has never
 rejected a Government policy, though some have been modified as
 a result of delegates' concerns expressed behind the scenes.
 In a very few cases, delegates have cast negative ballots or
 abstained in voting to express dissent, but there were no
 reports of this occurring in the 1983 session. The Congress's
 role was potentially enhanced by the formation this year of six
 committees to monitor the Government's performance, although it
 is unclear to what extent these committees will be allowed to
 exercise their oversight functions.
 In accordance with the Constitution, elections to local
 people's congresses are scheduled to take place in 1984 when
 Chinese citizens will vote directly for their representatives
 to serve three-year terms. By law, each of these contests must
 have at least two candidates. In the 1980-81 elections--the
 first time these direct, multi-candidate elections were
 held--candidates were chosen under close party supervision by
 local election committees composed of representatives from the
 Communist Party, party-controlled "mass" organizations,
 government, and united front bodies. The authorities claimed
 about 30 percent of the victors were nonparty members.
 Traditionally a male-dominated society, China has few women in
 top party and government positions. For example, only three of
 the 42 ministers in the central Government are women, and just
 one full member of the Politburo is female. Participation by
 women increases somewhat at the provincial level and more
 noticeably in local government. The 1983 nationwide reshuffle
 of provincial leaders included the selection of China's first
 female governor.
 
 
 753
 Minority ethnic and religious groups in border areas such as
 Xinjiang, Xizang (Tibet), Guangxi, Inner Mongolia, and Yunnan
 are permitted a limited degree of autonomy and official
 recognition of their languages. (Some 6.7 percent of China's
 people belong to minority nationalities. The new state
 Constitution stipulates that either the chairmen or the vice
 chairmen of the Standing Committees of people's congresses in
 autonomous regions, prefectures, or counties, should be a
 member of the principal nationality group in that particular
 area. The State Nationalities Commission reported in September
 that the number of minority nationality officials in government
 and party positions had reached 1 million, a 30 percent
 increase over 1978. The spring reshuffle of provincial party
 committees increased minority representation; for example,
 two-thirds of the Tibet party standing committee members are
 ethnic Tibetans. However, party first secretaries in the
 autonomous regions are all Han Chinese. Despite the party's
 liberalized minorities policy, friction between Han Chinese and
 minorities remains high in Tibet and probably in other minority
 areas as well. The executions and arrests in 1983 in Tibet
 have reduced the chances of reconciliation between the Chinese
 authorities and the Dalai Lama.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitudes Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigations of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 China is a member of both the United Nations Human Rights
 Commission and the Commission on the Status of Women. In
 addition, China is a party to international conventions or
 protocols such as those on refugees, women, and apartheid.
 There are no known organizations within China monitoring human
 rights conditions. According to its 1983 report, which covered
 1982, Amnesty International listed its main concerns in China
 as trials of political prisoners that fell short of
 international standards, imprisonment of prisoners of
 conscience, detention without trial of political prisoners, and
 use of the death penalty. Amnesty's report also stated that
 its representatives had held discussions in 1982 with Chinese
 officials in New York and Geneva. Freedom House in its 1982
 report describes China as 'not free' and gives it a low rating
 for both political and civil liberties.
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 China faces massive problems in providing adequate health care,
 nutrition and education for its population of 1,059,802,000 (a
 World Bank estimate for 1983), 80 percent of whom live in the
 countryside. The Chinese have succeeded in meeting basic needs
 in these areas. Basic health care is available at no or modest
 cost. Urban health care standards, however, remain
 significantly better than those in rural areas as reflected in
 different infant mortality rates--an estimated 13 per 1,000 in
 the cities compared to 22 per 1,000 in the countryside. (These
 figures are 1982 Chinese statistics; 1983 World Bank data place
 China's overall infant mortality rate at 47.40 per 1,000.)
 According to the World Bank, China's calorie supply exceeded
 nutritional requirements by about three percent in 1979. The
 average life expectancy is 68 (64 according to 1982 World Bank
 figures).
 
 
 754
 With about one-fourth nf the world's population squeezed onto
 about seven percent o. its arable land, China's leaders have
 made population control one of their top priorities. To
 achieve its goal of limiting the nation's population to 1.2
 billion by the year 2000, the Government has promulgated a
 strict family planning policy which sets a norm of one child
 per family and is backed by a massive educational campaign as
 well as incentives and disincentives. Benefits accruing to
 couples who agree to have and indeed have only one child
 include free medical care and education for the child, priority
 for housing and job assignments, cash bonuses when declaring an
 intention to have only one child, and a monthly stipend of
 about five to ten percent of base wage paid until the child is
 14. Couples who violate the one-child limit face intense
 social pressure, fines, difficulties in securing their share of
 officially-allocated housing, and denial of free medical care
 and education for the second child. Although far more
 successful in urban areas than in the countryside, these
 measures have helped reduce the population growth rate to an
 estimated 1.3 percent in 1983. There have been reports of
 forced sterilizations and abortions taking place in some
 localities. Chinese officials claim that the Government
 rejects the use of compulsion and takes prompt measures against
 local officials guilty of such actions. The one-child policy,
 institution of 'responsibility systems' in the countryside, and
 the traditional preference for boys have combined to cause an
 upsurge in female infanticide in some rural areas--a problem
 which has plagued China for centuries. In April, the Chinese
 press reported that female infanticide had resulted in
 abnormally high ratios (2:1 or more) of boys to girls in rural
 areas of two provinces. Although the authorities insist that
 infanticide is not widespread and that China's ratio of newborn
 boys to girls is normal, they acknowledge that female
 infanticide is a problem and have warned the public of its
 illegality. Perpetrators whose cases have been reported were
 punished with prison sentences ranging from 3 to 13 years. In
 addition, officials including Premier Zhao Ziyang have
 condemned the practice in public speeches.
 The Constitution calls for universal and compulsory primary
 education, and 93 percent of eligible school children are
 enrolled in the first grade although many later drop out.
 Around 30 percent of young people in the relevant age group
 complete high school, and around five percent of high school
 graduates attend college. Although the male-female ratio is
 about even at the beginning of the educational process, the
 percentage of males increases in the higher grades, with women
 accounting for only about 25 percent of college students. The
 1982 census placed adult literacy (defined as knowledge of
 2,500 written Chinese characters) at 76.5 percent of the
 population.
 Housing is crowded and poorly constructed in both urban and
 rural areas; rural localities frequently lack basic amenities
 such as electricity and running water. Rents are extremely
 low, averaging in 1982 about 1.4 percent of an urban dweller's
 income. Although most peasants own their own homes and thus
 pay no rent, they spend about 8.4 percent of their income on
 housing. Construction of housing units is a priority item in
 the Government's economic plan. According to the Ministry of
 Urban and Rural Construction, the Government built 370 million
 square meters of housing from 1979 to 1982, but 50 million
 city-dwellers--one-third of the urban population--are still
 awaiting new homes.
 
 
 755
 The Constitution endorses the principle that all citizens are
 equal. As in politics, however, women lag behind men in the
 socioeconomic realm despite progress in recent years. The
 percentage of women in the urban labor force has risen to over
 36 percent. Yet, women are still assigned to lower paying
 jobs, notwithstanding official endorsement of job equality.
 Despite greater educational opportunities, 70 percent of
 illiterates are women. Moreover, despite official sanctions,
 traditional practices, such as the selling of brides, continue
 in rural areas. Minorities benefit from the party's
 liberalization program towards them which includes special
 treatment in marriage and family planning, employment, and
 university admission, as well as increased economic assistance.
 However, the standard of living of minorities--most of whom
 live in poor, remote areas--remains far below that of their Han
 compatriots. Previous discrimination against those with
 suspect backgrounds, including intellectuals and former
 capitalists, has been significantly curtailed.
 China has recorded substantial economic growth in recent years,
 but its 1982 per capita Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of $258.00
 still ranks among the lowest in the world.
 In 1982, real national income reportedly grew by 7.4 percent,
 which implies a GDP deflation factor of less than one-half of
 one percent. China's official cost-of-living index for 1982
 was up 1.9 percent. Many foreign observers, however, believe
 China's overall inflation in 1982 was much higher, perhaps as
 high as 10 percent. Unemployment in urban areas is a serious
 problem, particularly among youth. Foreign estimates of the
 urban unemployed ranged up to 15 million, over 10 percent of
 the urban work force..
 In a shift away from the Soviet model with its stress on rapid
 growth of heavy industry and military expenditures, Chinese
 economic planners in recent years have stressed the development
 of agriculture and light industry, leading to the increased
 availability of agricultural and consumer goods. Moreover, the
 leadership has moved towards a more decentralized economy with
 fewer administrative controls and greater freedom for market
 forces and individual initiative. In the cities, this policy
 has manifested itself in the official encouragement of
 collective enterprises owned by the employees and of individual
 businesses to alleviate the severe unemployment problem. From
 1978 to 1982, the number of workers employed in collectives
 increased 29.4 percent, now accounting for 23.7 percent of the
 urban work force. The roughly 2 million urban individual
 enterprises, almost all in the services sector, employ less
 than two percent of urban workers but they, along with
 collective workers, accounted for over 38 percent of new
 workers employed last year.
 In the countryside, the new economic policies allow individuals
 to have more of a voice in what and how much they produce.
 While land remains collectively owned, 95 percent of the rural
 production teams have adopted *responsibility systems' which
 allocate the use of land to individuals or households for a
 term of years and allow them to make their own production
 decisions after state quotas are met. In addition, some 15
 percent of agricultural land is farmed as private plots. Free
 markets, where goods are sold directly by peasants, are now a
 common feature of life in both urban and rural China.
 Television sets, radios, sewing and washing machines, and
 bicycles can be owned by individuals and passed on to
 descendants. The authorities now consider housing also to be a
 consumer good which may be privately owned. While houses in
 the countryside have been individually owned for some time, the
 authorities have recently begun experiments in four cities to
 transfer ownership of state-built apartments to the occupants.
