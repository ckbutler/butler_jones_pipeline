 ALGERIA
 President Liamine Zeroual, a former general, was elected in November 1995 to
 a 5-year term. Zeroual previously had served as president of a transition govern-
 ment established by the army in 1994, which included a National Transition Council
 (CNT) as a surrogate parliament. The President controls defense and foreign policy,
 appoints and dismisses the Prime Minister and cabinet ministers, and may dissolve
 the legislature. The presidential election was competitive. According to government
 figures, Zeroual received 61 percent of the votes; losing candidates claimed that
 there were instances of fraud but did not contest Zeroual's victory. In a flawed ref-
 erendum in November 1996, the Government obtained approval of proposed changes
 to the Constitution, including the provision of a second parliamentary chamber and
 greater presidential authority. In June 1997, Algeria held its first parliamentary
 elections since January 1992 and elected the first multiparty Parliament in Algerian
 history. The cancellation of the 1992 elections, which the Islamic Salvation Front
 (FIS) was poised to win, suspended the democratization process and a transition to
 a pluralistic republic, and escalated fighting, which still continues, between the se-
 curity forces and armed Islamist groups seeking to overthrow the Government and
 impose an Islamic state. Provincial and municipal elections also were held in 1997.
 The election campaigns were marked by increased openness; however, international
 observers and political parties pointed out numerous problems with the conduct of
 the elections. Although President Zeroual was scheduled to remain in office until
 2000, on September 11 he announced publicly that he would resign upon completion
 of multiparty elections to be held before the end of April 1999. The Government does
 not always respect the independence of the judiciary.
 The Government's security apparatus is composed of the army, air force, navy, the
 national gendarmerie, the national police, communal guards (a local police), and
 local self-defense forces. All of these elements are involved in counterinsurgency and
 counterterrorism operations and are under the control of the Government. The secu-
 rity forces committed numerous serious human rights abuses.
 The economy is slowly developing from a state-administered to a market-oriented
 system. The Government has implemented successfully stabilization policies and
 structural reforms. However, privatization of state enterprises and the restructuring
 of the banking and housing construction sectors have just begun. Uncompetitive and
 unprofitable state enterprises constitute the bulk of the industrial sector. The state-
 owned petroleum sector's output represented about a quarter of national income and
 about 95 percent of export earnings in 1998. The agricultural sector, which produces
 grains, fruit, cattle, fibers, vegetables, and poultry, makes up 10 to 12 percent of
 the economy. Algeria is a middle-income country; annual per capita income is ap-
 proximately $1,600. Officially, about 28 percent of the working-age population is un-
 employed, and about 70 percent of persons under the age of 30 can not find ade-
 quate employment. Some made a living from petty smuggling or street peddling.
 The Government's human rights record remained poor; although there were im-
 provements in some areas, serious problems remain. Citizens do not yet have the
 effective right to change their government peacefully. The security forces committed
 extrajudicial killings, were responsible for numerous disappearances, routinely tor-
 tured or otherwise abused detainees, and arbitrarily arrested and detained or held
 incommunicado many individuals suspected of involvement with armed Islamist
 groups. Human Rights Watch (HRW) reported that on some occasions, from late
 1997 continuing into January 1998, security forces failed to intervene to prevent or
 halt massacres of civilians. HRW claims that there were questions raised about se-
 curity forces' indifference to, or complicity in, civilian deaths. Prison conditions are
 poor. Prolonged pretrial detention and lengthy trial delays are problems. Although
 the Constitution provides for an independent judiciary, executive branch decrees re-
 strict some of the judiciary's authority. Illegal searches and infringements on citi-
 (1621)
 
 
 1622
 
 zens' privacy rights also remained problems. The Government censored news about
 security information and the armed groups. The Government also continued to re-
 strict freedom of speech, press, assembly, association, and movement. During the
 1997 legislative, municipal, and provincial elections, there were credible reports of
 irregularities such as government harassment of opposition party observers and
 fraud in vote-tally procedures. The independent press commented openly and regu-
 larly on the upcoming 1999 elections. The Family Code limited women's civil rights,
 and domestic violence against women remained a serious problem. Child abuse is
 a problem. In July the Government passed a law that made Arabic the official lan-
 guage, leading to concern among the Berber ethnic minority. Child labor is a prob-
 1em.
 Although the number of security incidents involving armed groups and terrorists
 decreased significantly and became more localized when compared with previous
 years, these opposition forces committed numerous serious abuses and killed thou-
 sands 'of civilians. Armed Islamists continued their widespread campaign of insur-
 gency, targeting government- officials and families of security members, as well as
 persons whose lifestyles they consider to be in conflict with Islamic values.
 Armed groups continued to kill numerous civilians, including infants, by mas-
 sacres and small bombs. Armed Islamists particularly targeted women; there were
 numerous instances of kidnaping and rape. Bombs left in cars, cafes, and markets
 killed and maimed persons indiscriminately. Some killings were also attributed to
 revenge, banditry, and land grabs. There were estimates that as many as 7,000 ci-
 vilians, terrorists, and security forces died during the year in domestic turmoil, and
 that as many as 77,000 persons have been killed during the past 7 years.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killin.-There were credible reports that se-
 curity forces were responsible for extrajudicial killings. In February Kamel Nachef,
 who was being held in Tizi Ouzou on charges of supporting terrorism, died while
 in police custody. In October the press reported that 27 prisoners died of asphyxia-
 tion while being transported in a police vehicle from one jail to another. The Gov-
 ernment maintains that the security forces resort to lethal force only in the context
 of armed clashes with terrorists. The Government also contends that, as a matter
 of policy, disciplinary action is taken against soldiers or policemen who are guilty
 of violating human rights. In April the Government claimed to have investigated
 and arrested suspects in 128 separate cases of alleged abuse by members of the se-
 curity forces. However, the local press reported that all but 7 of the 120 officers de-
 tained ultimately were released.
 Human Rights Watch (HRW) reported that on some occasions, from late 1997 con-
 tinuing into January 1998, security forces failed to intervene to prevent or halt mas-
 sacres of civilians. HRW claims that there were questions raised about security
 forces' indifference to, or complicity in, civilian deaths.
 According to press reports, in early January government troops killed 35 civilians
 during a manhunt for the killers of more than 400 villagers. There were also press
 reports that police killed one rioter during protests after the killing of popular sing-
 er Lounes Matoub by Islamic rebels.
 Progovernment militias also killed civilians during the year. In April the Govern-
 ment arrested the mayors of two municipalities in the province of Relizane, along
 with several other officials, on charges that they were responsible for the deaths of
 as many as 77 villagers over a 5-year period. The mayors were given suspended sen-
 tences and placed under "judicial control," a practice that requires them to check
 in regularly with the local police.
 In June the criminal court of Tizi Ouzou announced the verdict in the case of a
 group of communal guards, tried on charges ranging from arson to premeditated
 murder, for an August 1997 raid against the homes of villagers known to be family
 members of terrorists. Three villagers were killed, and several houses were burned
 during the raid. The sentences ranged from 10 years' imprisonment to capital pun-
 ishment in absentia.
 Armed groups targeted both security force members and civilians. In many cases,
 terrorists randomly targeted civilians in an apparent attempt to create social dis-
 order. They carried out massacres in numerous towns and villages and also mas-
 sacred civilians at roadblocks. They also used bombs to kill civilians and create
 panic. For example, in August a bomb exploded in a neighborhood of Algiers, killing
 19 persons and injuring 61 (also see Section 1.g.). In other incidents, terrorists spe-
 cifically targeted their victims as instruments of the State or as individuals whose
 lifestyles they considered in conflict with Islamic values. During January armed ter-
 
 
 1623
 rorists killed hundreds of citizens. Among the worst instances were the massacres
 in the village of Sidi Hammad and in a number of villages in the western province
 of Relizane, in which it is estimated that as many as 126 civilians were killed and
 76 were wounded. In Sidi Hamad, many of the victims apparently were killed when
 a bomb exploded in a room where a large group was watching a video. In the village
 of Haouche Sahroui, persons reportedly were killed as they left a mosque.
 There were numerous massacres committed by rebel forces. For example, in
 March attackers slit the throats of six persons, including four blind women, in the
 village of Haouche Mean, south of Algiers. In April 16 persons were killed-many
 of them in their sleep-near Medea, 60 miles south of Algiers, and M'sila, 125 miles
 southeast of the capital. At the end of the month, 40 persons were massacred in
 a village in Medea province. In mid-May, suspected Muslim rebels cut the throat&
 of 22 persons, including 3 children, mi Oran. On May 27, rebels killed 11 persons,
 including 7 children, and wounded 5 others, in Melouane, Blida province. On June
 25, Lounes Matoub, a popular singer and supporter of the Berber cause, was killed
 at a false roadblock on Beni Douala Road, southeast of Tizi Ouzou. The Armed Is-
 lamic Group (GIA) claimed responsibility for the killing. The killing occurred hours
 after another group slit the throats of 17 persons in an isolated village. The death
 of Matoub led to protests and riots in several cities. According to press reports, near-
 ly 1,000 youths in Tizi Ouzou stoned police; police responded with clubs and tear
 gas. Police shot and killed one demonstrator and injured three others. In October
 the Government announced the capture of five suspects alleged to be members of
 the terrorist group GIA and responsible for Lounes' death. In mid-October, Muslim
 rebels slashed the throats of nine persons in the village of Hamma Bouziane. In late
 November, the press reported that up to 200 skeletons, believed to be those of the
 victims of Islamic guerrillas, were unearthed from mass graves in two wells 12
 miles southwest of Algiers. In early December, Muslim rebels slashed the throats
 of eight villagers in Les Eucalyptus, 55 miles east of Algiers. On December 10, an
 armed band killed 45 persons in Tadjena, about 125 miles west of Algiers. In mid-
 December, Muslim militants slashed the throats of four villagers in Ahmer el Ain,
 about 35 miles west of Algiers. At the end of December, 40 armed men killed 15
 persons in the village of Aln N'sour; most were stabbed to death.
 During the year, no journalists or foreigners died in terrorist attacks.
 A series of brutal massacres during Ramadan prompted a request in February
 from the European Parliament for an investigation by a U.N. Special Rapporteur.
 Claiming that the issue was one of terrorism and not human rights, the Govern-
 ment refused the request on grounds of national sovereignty.
 In their final report, a six-member U.N. panel of eminent persons noted that the
 Government had permitted it visits to different regions of the country during its 2-
 week stay, including to some sites where massacres had occurred. However, the
 panel was not permitted to go to the area of Blida where a massacre had occurred
 2 days before the panel's arrival.
 b. Disappearance.-There are credible reports of disappearances occurring over a
 period of several years, many of which involved the security forces. In September
 the Ministry of Interior established an office in each district to accept cases from
 resident families of those reported missing. By year's end, the Ministry had agreed
 to investigate 1,735 cases of reports of alleged disappearances at the hands of the
 security forces. Families of the missing, defense attorneys, -and local human rights
 groups insist that the Government could do more to solve the outstanding cases.
 The Government asserts that the majority of reported cases of disappearances in-
 volve either terrorists disguised as security forces or former armed Islamist support-
 ers who went underground to avoid terrorists' reprisals.
 Terrorist groups kidnaped hundreds of civilians, including family members of the
 security forces. Sometimes the mutilated corpses of such victims were found later.
 However, in many other instances the victims disappeared, and their families could
 not obtain information about their fate. Armed Islamist groups reportedly kidnaped
 young women and kept them as sex slaves (see Section 1.c.).
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Both the Constitution and legislation ban torture and other cruel, inhuman, or de-
 grading treatment; however, according to local human rights groups and defense
 lawyers, the police regularly resort to torture when interrogating persons suspected
 of being involved with, or having sympathies for, armed Islamists. There were sev-
 eral credible reports of torture at the Algiers police facility called Chateau Neuf.
 There were reports that the police applied electric shocks to sensitive body parts
 and sexually molested female prisoners. There were no reports of the use of the tor-
 ture technique "le chiffon" during the year. Police beatings of detainees continue to
 be a common practice. Many victims of torture hesitate to make public allegations
 due to fear of government retaliation. The Interior Ministry and the government-
 
 
 1624
 funded National Observatory for Human Rights (ONDH) have stated publicly that
 the Government would punish those persons who violated the law and practiced tor-
 ture, but'they have never revealed whether any individuals accused of torture have
 been investigated and punished. '
 The Government used force to break up several demonstrations (see Section 2.b.).
 There were unconfirmed reports that security forces personnel were responsible
 for several rapes.
 Armed Islamic groups also committed numerous abuses such as beheading, muti-
 lating, disemboweling, and dismembering their victims, including infants, children,
 and pregnant women. These terrorists also committed dozens of rapes of female vic-
 tims, many of whom were murdered thereafter. There were also frequent reports of
 other young women being abducted, raped for weeks at a time, and effectively held
 as sex slaves for the use of leaders and members of the group.
 Prison conditions are poor, and prisons are very overcrowded. According to human
 rights activists, cells often contain several times the number of prisoners for which
 they originally were designed. Medical treatment for prisoners is available, but is
 severely limited.
 In general, the Government does not permit independent monitoring of prisons or
 detention centers. However, in November the Government received a delegation
 from the International Committee for the Red Cross (ICRC). Talks between ICRC
 representatives and the Government resulted in agreement to conduct prison visits
 after the 1999 elections. However, the Government refused the ICRC access to mili-
 tary prisons and to several jailed FIS leaders. The Government allowed the visiting
 members of a U.N. panel -of eminent persons to visit a prison in August, but denied
 them access to jailed leaders of the outlawed FIS party (see Section 4).
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution prohibits arbitrary ar-
 rest and detention; however, the security forces continued to arrest arbitrarily and
 detain citizens. The Constitution stipulates that incommunicado detention in crimi-
 nal cases prior to arraignment may not exceed 48 hours, after which the suspect
 must be charged or released. According to the Antiterrorist Law of 1992, the police
 may hold suspects in prearraigament detention for up to 12 days; they also must
 inform suspects of the-charges against them. In practice the security forces regu-
 larly ignore this 12-day limit.
 The chairman of the Government's human rights body, the ONDH, confirmed to
 the press in May that the ONDH has proof that some detainees are in a secret place
 of detention in the country. FIS president Abassi Madani, who was released from
 prison in 1997, remains under house arrest and is allowed to receive visits only from
 members of his family (see Section 2.d.). The press reported that jailed oppositionist
 and FIS vice president Ali Benhadj, who had been held incommunicado since 1992,
 was permitted a family visit in October. A number of lawyers who had defended sus-
 pects in security cases were held in incommunicado detention during the year.
 The Antiterrorist Law of 1992 suspended the requirement that the police obtain
 warrants in order to make an arrest. During the year, the police made a few broad
 nighttime sweeps of neighborhoods in the Algiers suburbs in search of suspected ter-
 rorists and often detained suspects without identifying themselves. In some cases,
 the police purposely arrested close relatives of suspected terrorists in order to force
 those suspects to surrender (see Section 1.f.). Police and communal guards some-
 times detain persons at checkpoints (see Section 2.d.).
 Prolonged pretrial detention was a problem. Persons accused of crimes sometimes
 did not receive expeditious trials. Hundreds of state enterprise officials arrested on
 charges of corruption in 1996 remained in detention.
 Under the state of emergency, the Minister of Interior is authorized to detain sus-
 pects in special' camps administered by the army. In 1995 the Government an-
 nounced that it had closed the last camp and released the 641 prisoners there. How-
 ever, there were subsequent allegations the camp still exists and that some of the
 prisoners were re-arrested later.
 Forced exile is not a legal form of punishment and is not known to be practiced.
 However, there are numerous cases of self-imposed exile involving former FIS mem-
 bers or individuals who maintain that they have been accused falsely of terrorism
 as punishment for openly criticizing government policies. One such case involves Ali
 Bensaad, a professor at the University of Constantine, who remains in exile in Ger-
 many after he was sentenced to death in absentia by the courts for allegedly being
 a party to a-terrorist act.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution provides for an independent judi-
 ciary; however, in practice the Government does not always respect the independ-
 ence of the judicial system.
 The judiciary is composed of the civil courts, which try misdemeanors and felo-
 nies, and the military courts, which have tried civilians for security and terrorism
 
 
 1625
 
 offenses. There is also a Constitutional Council that reviews the constitutionality of
 treaties, laws, and regulations. Although the Council is not part of the judiciary, it
 has the authority to nullify laws found unconstitutional. Regular criminal courts try
 those individuals accused of security-related offenses, but there have been very few
 actual trials. Some observers maintain that, as a result of the 1995 abolition of the
 special security courts, long-term detentions without trial have increased, as the se-
 curity forces are reluctant to release suspects to ordinary criminal judges.
 According to the Constitution, defendants are presumed innocent until proven
 guilty. They have the right to confront their accusers and may appeal the conviction.
 Trials are public, and defendants have the right to legal counsel. However, the au-
 thorities do not always respect all legal provisions regarding defendants' rights, and
 continue to violate due process. Some lawyers do not accept cases of individuals ac-
 cused of security-related offenses, due to fear of retribution from the security forces.
 Defense lawyers for members of the banned FIS have suffered harassment, death
 threats, and arrest.
 There are no credible estimates of the number of political prisoners. An unknown
 number of persons who may be considered political prisoners were serving prison
 sentences because of their Islamist sympathies and membership in the FIS.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution provides for the inviolability of the home, but the state of emergency
 authorizes provincial governors to issue exceptional warrants at any time. Security
 forces often entered residences without warrants. Security forces also deployed an
 extensive network of secret informers against both terrorist targets and political op-
 ponents. The Government monitors telephones and sometimes disconnects service to
 political opponents and journalists. Security forces detained relatives of suspects to
 attempt to compel the suspects to surrender (see Section 1.d.).
 Armed Islamists occasionally entered private homes either to kill or kidnap resi-
 dents or to steal weapons, valuables, or food. After massacres that took place in
 their villages, numerous civilians fled their homes. Armed Islamist groups consist-
 ently used threats of violence to extort money from businesses and families across
 the country.
 g. Use of Excessive Force and Violations of Humanitarian Law in Internal Con-
 flicts.-Armed groups were responsible for numerous, indiscriminate, nonselective
 killings. Terrorists left bombs at several markets and other public places during the
 year, killing and injuring dozens of persons. In rural areas, terrorists continued to
 plant bombs and mines, often to prevent security forces from pursuing them follow-
 ing an attack. For example, in February one bomb killed 18 persons and wounded
 25 others on a train south of Algiers, and another killed at least 10 persons and
 wounded 16 on a bus south of the capital. Also in February, one bomb in a caf6 in
 Algiers killed at least three persons and injured eight. In May a bomb killed at least
 16 persons and wounded 61 in the Boumaati outdoor market in El-Harrach, a sub-
 urb of Algiers. Also in May, a bomb concealed in a cow's carcass exploded in a mar-
 ket in Khemis Miliana, 70 miles south of Algiers, killing seven persons. In early
 July, a car bomb exploded in a market in Bab Ezzouar, a suburb of Algiers, killing
 one person and injuring several others. Also in July, another bomb exploded at a
 crowded market in a suburb of Algiers, killing at least 10 persons and injuring 21
 others. In August a bomb exploded in downtown Algiers, killing 19 persons and in-
 juring 61. In September a bomb in Khemis killed at least 4 persons and wounded
 15 others. In early December, a bomb in Em Delfa, 80 miles west of Algiers, killed
 14 persons and injured 23 others. In mid-December, a bomb exploded at a market
 in the town of Aflou, killing one person. At the end of December, mortar shells and
 bombs hit the town of Khemis Miliana, killing 15 persons and injuring 40 others.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech;
 however, the Government restricts this right in practice. A 1990 law specifies that
 freedom of speech must respect "individual dignity, the imperatives of foreign policy,
 and the national defense." The state of emergency decree gave the Government
 broad authority to restrict these freedoms and to take legal action against what it
 considered to be threats to the State or public order. However, the Government did
 not strictly enforce these regulations, and the independent press reported regularly
 on security matters without penalty. Reporting by government-controlled press or-
 gans frequently included deflated numbers of civilians and government forces killed
 and inflated terrorist casualty counts. In late 1997, the Government issued a direc-
 tive for the 1998 session of Parliament to take up debate on proposed revisions to
 the law that would lif some restrictions on journalists. However, Parliament had
 not completed its review by year's end.
 
 
 1626
 
 In March 1994, the Government issued an interministerial decree that independ-
 ent newspapers could print security information only from official government bul-
 letins carried by the government-controlled press service, APS. Compliance with the
 government directive varied among independent newspapers, but there was a trend
 during the year toward increased openness about security force losses, and the Gov-
 ernment provided the press with more information than in the past about the secu-
 rity situation. The Ministry of Health continued to forbid medical personnel from
 speaking to journalists. The Government's definition of security information often
 extended beyond purely military matters to encompass broader political affairs. In
 1995 FIS officials who had been freed from detention in 1994 received direct orders
 from the Justice Ministry to make no further public statements. This ban remains
 in force.
 Journalists at independent newspapers at times avoided printing stories about the
 security situation and Islamist groups in order -to avoid difficulties with the Govern-
 ment.
 There were no reports during the year that the Government put journalists under
 'Judicial control." In previous years, the Government used, this practice to harass
 journalists who wrote offending articles by requiring the journalists to check in reg-
 ularly-with the local police and preventing them from leaving the country. The Gov-
 ernment harassed journalists through the regular use of criminal defamation stat-
 utes to prosecute newspapers for their publications of news and opinions. In July
 journalist Kadi Ihsan was arrested on his way to a human rights conference in Ge-
 neva. He was given a 4-month suspended sentence for allegedly "threatening and
 insulting"- the editor of a, progovernment newspaper. In October the editor of Le
 Matin was given a 4-month suspended sentence and fined for publishing articles
 that were critical of senior officials..In general, journalists exercised self-censorship
 by not publishing criticism of specific officials.
 There are no Islamist newspapers in print due to government pressure; however,
 legal Islamic political parties have access to the existing independent press, in
 which they express their opinions freely.
 The Government maintains an effective monopoly over printing companies and
 newsprint imports. In October the Government suspended several- independent
 newspapers' access to the government-controlled national printing press pending
 payment of costs for newsprint and labor. The suspended newspapers, together with
 other independient editors who joined them in a solidarity strike, ceased publishing
 for several weeks. The Government insisted that the issue was a commercial dis-
 * pute. The independent press maintained that the suspension was politically moti-
 vated and intended to obstruct publications that were highly critical of specific offi-
 cials.,
 The Government continued to exercise pressure on the independent press through
 the state-owned advertising company, ANEP, which was created in 1996. All state-
 owned companies that wish to place advertisements in a newspaper must submit
 the item to ANEP, which then decides in which newspapers to place it. In an econ-
 omy in which state companies' output and government services still represent ap-
 proximately two-thirds of national income, ANEP-provided advertising constitutes a
 significant source of advertising revenue for the country's newspapers. However,
 ANEP tends to provide significant amounts of advertising to publications with a
 strong anti-Islamist editorial line and to withhold advertising from,- those news-
 papers that undertake investigations of corruption. This ANEP policy even applies
 to those newspapers that have large readerships and may offer cheaper advertising
 rates.
 Since 1995 the Brussels-based International Federation of Journalists (FIJ), a
 nongovernmental organization (NGO) concerned with press freedom, has maintained
 an office in Algiers. In November the FIJ received government authorization to
 function officially in the country for the first time. In March the World Association
 of Newspapers (WAN) visited for 4 days to examine the working conditions of the
 press. In October the Government permitted a first-time visit by members of the
 Committee for the Protection of Journalists and allowed them broad access to local
 journalists and editors.
 Radio and television remained under government control, with coverage biased in
 favor of the Government's policies and its party, the National Democratic Rally
 (RND). Parliamentary debates are televised live. Satellite dish antennas are wide-
 spread, and millions of citizens have access to European and Middle Eastern broad-
 casting.
 Many artists, intellectuals, and university educators fled Algeria after widespread
 violence began in 1992. Few returned during the year. As a result, there were few
 academic seminars and colloquiums, although there appeared to be many more in
 
 
 1627
 
 1998 than in 1997. The Government did not interfere with nonpolitical seminars;
 it did sometimes interfere with seminars that were more political in content.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 the right of assembly, but the 1992 Emergency Law and government practice sharp-
 ly curtail it. Citizens and organizations must obtain a permit from the appointed
 local governor before holding public meetings. In February the Government used
 force to break up an unauthorized march against terrorism sponsored by the Social-
 ist Forces Front (FFS). In June the Government used force to end a mass dem-
 onstration in downtown Algiers by the Rally for Culture and Democracy (RCD)
 party to protest the death of Berber singer Matoub Lounes (see Section L.a.). In Au-
 gust the Government refused to grant permission to the families of missing persons
 to stage a march through downtown Algiers. However, the group assembled on a
 daily basis thereafter for more than a week outside the headquarters of the ONDH
 without government interference. In December the Government refused the Alge-
 rian League for the Defense of Human Rights (LADDH) authorization to hold a pub-
 lic commemoration ceremony marking the 50th anniversary of the United Nations
 Convention on Human Rights. The Government has refused meeting requests by
 various public interest groups, such as the Association of Victims of Terrorism, the
 National Syndicate of Magistrates, and the Independent Syndicate of University
 Professors. In October the Interior Ministry prohibited one of the large youth asso-
 ciations from holding a national conference.
 The Constitution provides for the right of association, but the 1992 Emergency
 Law and government practice severely restrict it. The Interior Ministry licenses all
 nongovernmental associations and regards all associations as illegal unless they
 have licenses. It may deny a license to, or dissolve, any group regarded as a threat
 to the existing political order. After the Government suspended the parliamentary
 election in 1992, it banned the FIS as a political party, and the social and charitable
 groups connected with it. Membership in the FIS is illegal.
 According to a 1989 law, all citizens except judges, army and security personnel,
 and members of the Constitutional Council have the right to join political organiza-
 tions. In 1997 the appointed legislature changed the law regulating political parties,
 banning political party ties to nonpolitical associations. The Government permits
 some specialized groups to function such as human rights and women's rights
 groups, social welfare groups, youth associations, and regionally-based cultural orga-
 nizations.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution declares Islam to be the state religion
 but prohibits discrimination based on religious belief, and the Government respects
 this right in practice. The small Christian and Jewish populations in the country
 practice their faiths without government interference.
 The Government appoints preachers to mosques and gives general guidance on
 sermons. The Government monitors activities in mosques for possible security-relat-
 ed offenses. The Ministry of Religious Affairs provides some financial support to
 mosques and limited control over the training-of imams.
 Conversions from Islam to other religions are rare. Because of safety concerns and
 potential legal and social problems, Muslim converts practice their new faith clan-
 destinely. The Shari'a-based Family Code prohibits Muslim women from marrying
 non-Muslims, although this regulation is not always enforced. The code does not re-
 strict Muslim men from marrying non-Muslim women.
 In 1994 the GIA declared its intention to eliminate Jews, Christians, and Poly-
 theists from Algeria. The GIA has not yet retracted that declaration, and, as a re-
 sult, the mainly foreign Christian community tends to curtail its public activities.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The law provides for freedom of domestic and foreign travel, and free-
 dom to emigrate; however, the Government at times restricts these rights. The Gov-
 ernment retains the policy of placing journalists and others under "judicial control,"
 which prevents them from leaving the country (see Section 2.a.). On at least two
 occasions, the Government prohibited groups of children- who were disadvantaged
 economically or the victims of terrorism from traveling abroad for recreational pur-
 poses under NGO-sponsorship. The Government claimed that the children would be
 exploited by the foreign media. Human rights groups countered that the Govern-
 ment did not want the children exposed to questions regarding government involve-
 ment in security incidents.
 The Government does not allow foreign travel by senior officials from the banned
 FIS. FIS president Abassi Madani, who was released from prison in 1997, remains
 under house arrest (see Section 1.d.). The Government also does not permit young
 men who are eligible for the draft and who have not yet completed their military
 service to leave the country if they do not have special authorization; this authoriza-
 tion can be granted to students and to those individuals with special family cir-
 
 
 1628
 
 cumstances. The Family Code does not permit married females under 19 years of
 age to travel abroad without their husband's permission. The code also prohibits un-
 married females below the age of 19 or males below the age of 18 to travel abroad
 without their father's permission.
 Under the state of emergency, the Interior Minister and the provincial governors
 may deny residency in certain districts to persons regarded as threats to public
 order. The Government also restricts travel into four southern provinces, where
 much of the hydrocarbon industry and many foreign'workers are located, in order
 to enhance security in those areas.
 The police and the communal guards operate checkpoints throughout the country.
 They routinely stop vehicles to inspect identification papers and to search for evi-
 dence of terrorist activity. They sometimes detain persons at these checkpoints.
 Armed Islamist groups intercept citizens at temporary roadblocks in various re-
 gions to rob them of their cash and vehicles, or to kill them. According to press re-
 ports, armed groups sometimes massacred groups of civilian passengers at these
 roadblocks.
 The Constitution provides for the right of political asylum, and the Government
 occasionally grants asylum. The Government cooperates with the office of the
 United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and other humanitarian
 organizations in assisting refugees. It also provided first asylum. For example, it co-
 operates with the UNHCR on programs to help refugee Sahrawis, the former resi-
 dents of the Western Sahara who left that territory after Morocco took control of
 it in the 1970's. The Government also has worked with international organizations
 that help the Tuaregs, a nomadic people of southern Algeria and neighboring coun-
 tries. There were no reports of the forced expulsion of persons to a country where
 they fear persecution.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Despite recent democratic improvements, citizens do not yet have the effective
 ability to change their government peacefully. The strong prerogatives of the execu-
 tive branch, supported by the entrenched power of the military and the bureaucracy,
 prevent citizens from exercising this right.
 President Zeroual was elected in a November 1995 presidential election, officially
 winning 61 percent of the votes cast. The presidential campaign was generally freely
 contested. Three opposition candidates representing a spectrum of viewpoints had
 access to both the independent press and the government-controlled media, includ-
 ing radio and television. Their parties were permitted to hold rallies across the
 country, and they had authorization to send observers to polling stations. An inde-
 pendent election commission supervised the election process, but the opposition par-
 ties asserted that the commission did not carefully review complaints that it re-
 ceived about the conduct of the election.
 Under the Constitution, the President has the authority to rule by decree in spe-
 cial circumstances. The President subsequently must submit to the Parliament for
 approval decrees issued while the Parliament was not in session. The Parliament
 has a popularly elected lower chamber, the National Popular Assembly (APN) and
 an upper chamber, the National Council, two-thirds of whose members are elected
 by municipal and provincial councils. The President appoints the remaining one-
 third of the National Council's members. Legislation must have the approval of
 three-quarters of both the upper and lower chambers' members. Laws must origi-
 nate in the lower house.
 In June 1997, Algeria held its first elections to the APN since the January 1992
 elections were canceled, and elected the first multiparty Parliament in the country's
 history. Candidates representing 39 political parties participated, along with several
 independent candidates. All competing parties and candidates were allowed to cam-
 paign actively and had access to radio and television, although there was some gov-
 ernment manipulation of the broadcasts. Under a system of proportional representa-
 tion, the government party, the National Democratic Rally, won 154 seats, followed
 by the Islamist party Movement for the Society of Peace (MSP) with 69 seats, the
 National Liberation Front (FLN) with 64 seats, the Islamist party An-Nahdah with
 34 seats, the Berber-based Socialist Forces Front with 20 seats, and the Berber-
 based Rally for Culture and Democracy with 19 seats. Independent candidates won
 11 seats, the Workers' Party won 4 seats, and 3 other small parties won a combined
 total of 5 seats. Hundreds of international observers were present throughout the
 country. Some observers were refused access to certain provincial electoral commis-
 sions. Most observers believed that mobile polling stations, about 5 percent of all
 polling stations, did not furnish adequate protection of neutrality and transparency.
 In their final report, neutral observers stated that, of 1,258 (of the country's 35,000)
 
 
 1629
 voting stations that they assessed, 1,169 were satisfactory, 95 were problematic, and
 11 unsatisfactory. In November 1997, the provincial election commissions an-
 nounced the results of their adjudication of the appeals filed by various political par-
 ties. The RND lost some seats but remained the overall victor in the June Assembly
 elections.
 In 1997 the a ppointed previous legislature, the National Transition Council
 (CNT), changed the law regulating political parties. Under the controversial new
 law, parties require official approval from the Interior Ministry before they can be
 established. To obtain approval, a party must have 25 founders from across the
 country, whose names must be registered with the Interior Ministry. No party may
 seek to utilize religion, Berberism, or Arabism for political purposes. The law also
 bans political party ties to nonpolitical associations and regulates party financing
 and reporting requirements.
 The more than 30 existing political parties represent a wide spectrum of view-
 points and engage in activities from holding rallies to printing newspapers. The
 Government continues to ban the FIS as a political party. With the exception of the
 Government's party, the RND, the political parties sometimes encounter difficulties
 when dealing with local officials, who hinder their organizational efforts. In June
 police summoned then-released Noureddine Boukrouh, leader of the Party for the
 newa of Algeria (PRN), after 3 hours of questioning about his criticism of mem-
 bers of the Government. Parties' complaints, particularly claims of official favoritism
 toward the RND, increased during the period leading up to the 1997 elections. The
 Government monitored private telephone communications and sometimes discon-
 nected telephone service to political opponents for extended periods (see Section 1.f.).
 Opposition parties have very limited access to state-controlled television and radio,
 although the independent press publicizes their views without difficulty. However,
 during the recent election periods, opposition parties were given much more access
 to the state media.
 Women are underrepresented in government and politics. There are only 2 women
 in the Cabinet, and there are few others in senior government positions. Eleven of
 the 380 members of the lower house of Parliament are women. About 25 percent
 of judges are women, a percentage that has been growing in recent years. A woman
 heads a workers' party, and all the major political parties except one have women's
 divisions that are headed by females. Following the 1995 presidential elections, the
 Government changed the electoral law to require that women cast their ballots in
 person rather than give their proxy to their husbands or fathers.
 The Government does not ban political participation by any ethnic minority group.
 The Berbers, an ethnic minority centered in the Kabylie region, participate freely
 and actively in the political process. Two major opposition parties originated in the
 Berber-populated region of the country, the Socialist Forces Front (FFS) and the
 Rally for Culture and Democracy (RCD). These two Berber-based parties were re-
 quired to conform with changes in 1997 to the electoral law that stipulate that polit-
 ical parties must have 25 founders from across the country.
 The Tuaregs, a people of Berber origin, do not play an important role in politics,
 due in large part to their small numbers, estimated in the tens of thousands, and
 their nomadic existence.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The most active independent human rights group is the Algerian League for the
 Defense of Human Rights, an independent organization that has members through-
 out the country. The LADDH is not allowed access to the authorities or to prisons
 beyond the normal consultations allowed between a lawyer and a client. Members
 of the LADDH have suffered harassment. Telephone service to the LADDH presi-
 dent, for example, was intermittently disrupted, and he and other LADDH activists
 received death threats from unidentified callers.
 The less active Algerian League for Human Rights (LADH) is an independent or-
 ganization based in Constantine. The LADH has members throughout the country
 who follow individual cases.
 There is an Amnesty International chapter in the country, but it does not work
 on cases in Algeria.
 In February the Government denied a request from the European Parliament to
 investigate a series of massacres on grounds of national sovereignty (see Section
 l.a.).
 In August a six-member U.N. panel of eminent persons, led by former Portuguese
 President Mario Soares, visited for 2 weeks to assess the social and security situa-
 tion in country. The panel traveled to different regions, including several massacre
 sites, and visited a prison. Its members heard from a cross-section of representatives
 
 
 1630
 from the Government, political parties, civil society, human rights and women's or-
 ganizations, the media, religious institutions, the families of victims of terrorism
 and of persons who had disappeared, and from the general citizenry. The Govern-
 ment refused to allow any meetings between the panel members and jailed leaders
 of the outlawed FIS party.
 Among the conclusions in its final report, the U.N. panel of eminent persons
 urged international support for Algeria's fight against terrorism, While simulta-
 neously reminding the Government that its efforts to fight terrorism must take
 place "within the framework of legality, proportionality, and respect for the fun-
 damental human rights of the Algerian people." The report also called on the Gov-
 ernment to grant more political openness and to strengthen and invigorate Algerian
 institutions responsible for the promotion and protection of human rights. The re-
 port further called on the Government to "examine measures to improve the trans-
 parency of their decisions, the dialogue with and the flow of information to the Alge-
 rian citizenry."
 The National Observatory for Human Rights (ONDH) was established by the Gov-
 ernment in 1992 to report human rights violations to the authorities. It prepares
 an annual report with recommendations to the Government.
 In 1995 the Government established a national ombudsman (see Section 5).
 Section 5. Discrimination-Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status.
 The Constitution prohibits discrimination based on birth, race, sex, belief, or any
 other personal or social condition. The Government named a national ombudsman
 in 1995. Provincial representatives were designated in 1996 and 1997. They have
 a mandate to accept individual grievances and to make them known to the authori-
 ties. The ombudsman presents an annual report to the President. The 1997 report
 indicated that most complaints were about the allocation of public housing, another
 common complaint was the bureaucracy's unresponsiveness. Women continue to face
 legal and social discrimination.
 Women.-Women's rights advocates assert that spousal abuse is common, but
 there are no reliable studies regarding its extent. Spousal abuse is more frequent
 in rural than urban areas, especially among less-educated persons. There are no
 laws to protect women from spousal rape or abuse. Women's rights groups have ex-
 perienced difficulty in drawing attention to spousal abuse as an important social
 problem. Battered women must obtain medical certification of the physical effects
 of the assault before they lodge a complaint with the police. According to women's
 rights advocates, fewer than half of the women attacked visit doctors for such cer-
 tification. In August the Government released figures that indicated that by mid-
 year, the whereabouts of 319 women remained unknown and that there were 24 re-
 ports by women of rape. Most human rights groups believe that the actual figures
 are much higher. In October a first-ever rape crisis center was opened in Tipasa
 province for women who have been raped by terrorists.
 Some aspects -of the law, and many traditional social practices, discriminate
 against women. The 1984 Family Code, based on large part on Sunni Islamic law
 (Shari'a), treats women as minors under the legal guardianship of a husband or
 male relative. For example, a woman must obtain a father's approval to marry. Di-
 vorce is difficult to obtain except in cases of abandonment or the husband's convic-
 tion for a serious crime. Husbands generally obtain the right to the family's home
 in the case of divorce. Custody of the children normally goes to the mother, but she
 cannot enroll them in a particular school or take them out of the country without
 the father's authorization.
 The Family Code also affirms the Islamic practice of allowing a man to marry four
 wives, although this rarely occurs. However, a wife may sue for divorce if her hus-
 band does not inform her of his intent to marry another woman prior to the mar-
 riage. Only males are able to confer citizenship on their. children. Muslim women
 are prohibited from marrying non-Muslims; Muslim men can marry non-Muslim
 women (see Section 2.d.).
 Women suffer from discrimination in inheritance claims; in accordance with
 Shari'a, women are entitled to a smaller portion of an estate than are male children
 or a deceased husband's brothers. Females under 19 years of age cannot travel
 abroad without their husbands' or fathers' permission (see Section 2.d.). However,
 women may take out business loans and are the sole custodians of their dowries.
 Legally, if not always in practice, women have exclusive control over any income
 that they earn themselves.
 While social pressure against women pursuing higher education or a career exists
 throughout the country, it is much stronger in rural areas than in major urban-
 areas. Women constitute only 8 percent of the work force. Nonetheless, women may
 
 
 1631
 
 own businesses, enter into contracts, and pursue opportunities in government, medi-
 cine, law, education, the media, and the armed forces. Although the 1990 Labor Law
 bans sexual discrimination in the workplace, the leaders of women's organizations
 report that violations are commonplace. Labor Ministry inspectors do little to en-
 force the law.
 There are numerous small women's rights groups. Their main goals are to foster
 women's economic welfare and to amend aspects of the Family Code, although no
 such amendments have been passed yet.
 During the year, Islamic extremists often specifically targeted women. There were
 numerous instances of women being killed and mutilated in massacres. As many as
 80 percent of the victims of massacres were women and children. Armed Islamist
 groups reportedly kidnaped young women and kept them as sex slaves, for group
 leaders and members (see Section 1.c.).
 Children.-The Government is, committed in principle to protecting children's
 human rights. It provides free education for children 6 to 15 years of age, and free
 medical care for all citizens-albeit in often rudimentary facilities. The Ministry of
 Youth and Sports has programs for children, but these face serious funding prob-
 lems. Legal experts maintain that the Penal and Family Codes do not offer children
 sufficient protection. Hospitals treat numerous child abuse cases every year, but
 many cases go unreported. Laws against child abuse have not led to notable pros-
 ecutions against offenders.
 People With Disabilities.-The Government does not mandate accessibility to
 buildings or government services for people with disabilities. Public enterprises, in
 downsizing the work force, generally ignore a law that requires that they reserve
 1 percent of their jobs for the disabled. Social security provides for payments for or-
 thopedic equipment, and some nongovernment organizations.receive limited govern-
 ment financial support. The Government also tries to finance specialized training,
 but this initiative remains rudimentary.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-The Berbers are an ethnic minority, cen-
 tered in the Kabyie region. Berber nationalists have sought-to maintain their own
 cultural and lingustic identity while the Governments Arabization program contin-
 ues. As part of the National Charter signed in 1996, the Government and several
 major political parties agreed that the Berber culture and language, Amazigh, were
 major political components of the Algerian identity. In July the Government passed
 a law that made Arabic the official language of Algeria and required, on pain of
 fines, that all official government business be conducted in Arabic. The law also re-
 quires that Arabic be used for all broadcasts on national television and radio, for
 ubbing or subtitling all non-Arabic films, for medical prescriptions, and for commu-
 nications equipment. The law triggered widespread protests in early July in Berber
 regions, including the closing of shops and a call by the Berber Cultural Movement
 for Berbers to stay indoors in protest.
 There are professorships in Amazigh and Berber culture at the University of Tizi
 Ouzou, and in September the University started offering for the first time a degree
 in Amazigh and Berber culture. The government-owned national television station
 began broadcasting a brief nightly news program in Amazigh in 1996. Berbers hold
 influential positions in government, the army, business, and journalism.
 In June Matoub Lounes, a popular Berber singer and outspoken advocate of the
 Berber language and culture, was killed when his car was stopped under suspicious
 circumstances on a road in the Kabylie region (see Section L.a.). His death triggered
 massive riots by Berbers who demanded the Government acknowledge Berber ethnic
 concerns.
 The Tuaregs, a people of Berber origin, live an isolated, nomadic existence and
 are relatively few in number.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Workers have the right to establish trade unions of
 their choice. About two-thirds of the labor force belongs to unions. There is an um-
 brella labor confederation, the General Union of Algerian Workers (UGTA) and its
 affiliated entities, which dates from the era of a single political party. The UGTA
 encompasses national syndicates specialized by sector. There are also some autono-
 mous unions, such as syndicates for Air Algeria Pilots (SPLA), airport technicians
 (SNTMA), and teachers (CNES).
 Workers are required to obtain government approval to establish a union. The
 1990 Law on Labor Unions requires the Labor Ministry to approve a union applica-
 tion within 30 days. The Autonomous Syndicates Confederation (CSA) has tried
 since early 1996 to organize the autonomous syndicates, but without success. The
 application that the CSA filed with the Labor Ministry still was pending at year's
 end, although the CSA continues to function without official status. The law pro-
 
 
 1632
 
 hibits unions from associating with political parties and also prohibits unions from
 receiving funds from foreign sources. The courts are empowered to dissolve unions
 that engage in illegal activities. The labor union organized by the banned FIS, the
 Islamic Syndicate of Workers (SIT), was dissolved in 1992 because it had no license.
 Under the state of emergency, the Government is em powered to require workers
 in both the public and private sectors to stay at their jobs in the event of an uiau-
 thorized or illegal strike. According to the 1990 Law on Industrial Relations, work-
 ers may strike only after 14 days of mandatory conciliation, mediation, or arbitra-
 tion. This law states that arbitration decisions are binding on both parties. If no
 agreement is reached in arbitration, the workers may strike legally after they vote
 by secret ballot to do so. A minimum level of public services must be maintained
 during public sector service strikes.
 In July the Journalists' National Union went on a 21-day hunger strike to-protest
 relocation of their government-subsidized office space from a downtown hotel to one
 well outside of Algiers. The Union and the Government reportedly. found a mutually.
 satisfactory solution to the problem. In October there was a 12-day strike by Air-
 Algeria Pilots, which was joined by the UGTA and the SNTMA. Other separate
 strike actions during the year involved university teachers (CNES), telecommuni-
 cations workers (PTT), and metalworkers.
 Unions may form and join federations or confederations, affiliate with inter-
 national labor bodies, and develop relations with foreign labor groups. For example,
 the UGTA has contacts with French unions.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The law provides for collec-
 tive bargaining for all unions, and the Government permits this right in practice.
 The law prohibits discrimination by employers against union members and organiz-
 ers, and provides mechanisms for resolving trade union complaints of antiunion
 practices by employers. It also permits unions to recruit members at the workplace.
 The Government has established an export processing zone in Jijel._
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced or compulsory labor is in-
 compatible with the Constitution's provisions on individual rights. The Penal Code
 prohibits compulsory labor, including by cbildren, and the Government generally en-
 forces the ban effectively. However, armed Islamist groups reportedly kidnap young
 women and keep then as sex slaves (see Sections 1.b., 1.c., and 5).
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment.-The mini-
 mum age for employment is 16 years. Inspectors from the Ministry of Labor enforce
 the minimum employment age by making periodic or unannounced inspection visits
 to public-sector enterprises. They do not enforce the law effectively in the agricul-
 turl or private sectors. Economic necessity compels many children to resort to in-
 formal employment, such as street vending. The Government prohibits forced and
 bonded labor by children and generally enforces this prohibition effectively (see Sec-
 tion 6.c.).
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The law defines the overall framework for ac-
 ceptable conditions of work but leaves specific agreements on wages, hours, and con-
 ditions of employment to the discretion of employers in consultation with employees.
 The Government fixes by decree a monthly minimum wage for all sectors; however,
 this is not sufficient to provide a decent standard of living for a worker and family.
 On January 1, the minimum wage was raised to $93 (5,400 dinars) per month. Min-
 istry of Labor inspectors are responsible for ensuring compliance with the minimum
 wage regulation, however, their enforcement is inconsistent.
 The standard workweek is 40 hours. There are well-developed occupation and
 health regulations codified in a 1991 decree, but government inspectors do not en-
 force these regulations effectively. There were no reports of workers being dismissed
 for removing themselves from hazardous working conditions.
