 MAIU
 Mali has a constitutional Government headed by Prime Minister Ibrahim
 Boubacar Keita. In the country's first democratic elections in 1992, which were
 
 
 judged to be free and fair by international observers, citizens ratified a new Con-
 stitution and elected the National Assembly and President Alpha Oumar Konare as
 Head of State. These elections completed a 14-month transition following the 1991
 overthrow of the Moussa Traore regime.
 Violent student demonstrations flared up in February against government restric-
 tions on financial aid, the same issue that had forced the resignation of the Third
 Republic's first government in 1993. However, the Government and the students
 largely resolved their differences and the school year began normally. In June Tua-
 reg and Maur bandits and rebels in the North increased their attacks on civilian
 targets, leading to military, self-defense, and vigilante group reprisals; an estimated
 300 people, mostly civilians, were killed. Much of the Tuareg and Maur population
 fled to neighboring countries.
 Security forces are composed of the army air force, Gendarmerie, the Republican
 Guard, and the police. The army and air force are under the control of a civilian
 Minister of Defense, as are the Gendarmerie and the Republican Guard. The police
 are under the Ministry of Territorial Administration. There is a lack of discipline
 among the security forces' enlisted personnel, and elements of the security forces
 and vigilante groups committed extrajudicial killings and other human rights viola-
 tions in Mali's northern regions during reprisal raids against Tuareg and Maur ban-
 Mali is a very poor country. Its economy is based primarily on farming and ani-
 mal husbandry, making it highly dependent on adequate rainfall for its economic
 well-being. The Government continues to implement reforms aimed at modernizing
 the economy. Nevertheless, Mali continues to be beset by economic problems, includ-
 ing a depressed economy, inadequate government revenues, dependence on inter-
 national donors, demands from a number of vocal special interest groups, and a lit-
 eracy rate of about 23 percent.
 The Government generally respected constitutional provisions on freedoms of
 speech, press, assembly, association and religion. However, elements of the security
 forces committed an undetermined number of extrajudicial killings of Tuaregs and
 Maurs in June, July, and August. The judicial system continues to be plagued by
 a large backlog of cases, which results in persons languishing in prison for long pen-
 ods of time. Social and cultural factors continued to sharply limit economic and edu-
 cational opportunities for most women. Societal violence against women, including
 spouse abuse and female genital mutilation, is widespread.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of targeted
 political killings. A resurgence of Tuareg and Maur bandit/rebel attacks in Mali's
 northern regions in June, July, and August initiated a cycle of attacks and reprisals,
 leading to the deaths of as many as 300 people mostly civilians. In reprisal actions,
 elements of the security forces were responsible for an undetermined number of
 these extrajudicial killings. According to credible reports, armed groups of Tuaregs
 and Maurs and self-defense/vigilante groups, organized by the black sedentary popu-
 lations, also committed extrajudicial killings.
 On April 21, in a reprisal attack against Tuaregs and Maurs in Menaka, the mili-
 tary killed 4 people and wounded 12. A military inquiry resulted only in the transfer
 of a number of military personnel to other camps, but there were no charges, trials,
 or convictions. In June and July, security forces and self-defense/vigilante groups in
 the Timbuktu region killed as many as 50 Tuaregs and Maurs, including the direc-
 tor of the IslaiclArabic Study and Documentation Center located in Timbuktu.
 On July 25 rebels attacked the town of Bamba and killed an estimated 40 civil-
 ians. Some reports placed the casualty figure over 100. The 1992 National Pact
 ended the official insurrection in the north, but bandit attacks continued sporadi-
 cally. The Government and four major rebel groups still recognize the Pact, but do
 not implement its provisions.
 On October 4, a four-person military patrol shot and killed the Swiss Cooperation
 Mission director and two Malian colleagues in the town of Niafunke, allegedly be-
 cause the mission was aiding Tuareg rebels. A government mission of inquiry into
 the killings determined that the patrol's actions were unwarranted and unjustified.
 By year's end, the Government had not identified publicly the responsible parties,
 nor set in motion judicial proceedings.
 On October 20, a large gup of rebels attacked the town of Ansongo in the south-
 eastern corner of Mali, killing ap proximately six persons, including the head of the
 military detachment and several civilians. On October 22, Tuaregs and Maurs at-
 tacked civilian and other targets in the city of Gao, killing approximately 14 persons
 
 
 156
 and wounding 17. The Government condemned such acts by all parties but appeared
 to have little control over some security elements in the nor. Although the Na-
 tional Pact calls for a Commission of Inquiry, the Government did nothing to create
 one.
 b. Disappearance.-There were credible but unconfirmed reports of disappearance,
 related to the escalation of violence in the north, which implicated elements of the
 security forces, Tuareg and Maur armed groups and, possibly, self-defense groups
 organized by the black sedentary populations. espite government condemnation,
 authorities made no inquiries, no arrests, and no prosecutions.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Prison conditions continue to be characterized by overcrowding, inadequate medical
 facilities, and limited food supplies. Several associations are working with women
 and juvenile prisoners to improve their conditions. Juvenile offenders are usually
 held in the same prison as adult offenders. Women are housed in the same prison
 facility as men but live in a separate compound.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution provides that suspects
 must be charged or released within 48 hours, and are entitled to counsel. In prac-
 tice, however, detainees are not always charged within the 48-hour period. More-
 over, administrative backlogs and insufficient lawyers, judges, and courts often
 cause lengthy delays in bringing people to trial. In extreme cases, individuals lan-
 guish severa years in prison before coming to trial.
 Bail does not exist. On rare occasions the authorities release defendants on their
 own recognizance. The Government released 18 former members of the overthrown
 Moussa Traore regime who faced charges of economic crimes against the State. A
 court found the former president and three former government officials to be respon-
 sible for the deaths of over 100 people during the demonstrations that led to
 Traore's overthrow, and the court sentenced the our to death in 1993. Although the
 Supreme Court denied their subsequent appeal, the President could still commute
 their sentences. Commandant Lamine Diabira, arrested by the Government in 1991
 for plotting to overthrow the then-transitional Government, was finally released in
 July for lack of evidence.
 The Government does not practice forced exile.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution provides for an independent judi-
 ciary, but the executive branch exerts considerable influence over the judicial sys-
 tem. The Ministry of Justice appoints judges and supervises both law enforcement
 and judicial functions, and the President heads the Superior Judicial Council, which
 supervises judicial activity. The Supreme Court has both judicial and administrative
 Vowers. The Constitution provides for a separate Constitutional Court and a High
 o"ourt of Justice with the power to try senior government officials in cases of trea-
 son.
 Except in the case of minors, trials are public, and defendants have the right to
 be present and to have an attorney of their choice. Defendants are presumed inno-
 cent and have the right to confront witnesses and to appeal decisions to the Su-
 preme Court. Court-appointed attorneys are provided for the indigent on a pro beno
 hasis. The majority of disputes in ral Mali are handled at the village level and
 are generally decided by  e village chief in consultation with the elders. If these
 decisions are challenged in court, only those found to have legal merit will be
 upheld. Women and minorities are not discriminated against in courts.
 There are no political prisoners in Mali.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution provides for the inviolability of the home, and the Government respects
 this right in practice. Police searches are infrequent, and require judicial warrants.
 Security forces do, however, maintain physical surveillance of individuals and
 groups believed to be threats to internal security; with court approval, police may
 maintain technical surveillance as well. There were no instances of forced resettle-
 ment.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech
 and the press. The Government controls the only television station, two of many
 radio stations, and one of the three daily newspapers, but these all operate on a
 semi-independent basis and are open to a wide range of views, including those criti-
 cal of the President, the Prime Minister, the Government, and other politicians.
 Apart from the two Government radio stations in Bamako and several government
 stations serving regional capitals, there are seven independent stations in Bamako
 and many other independent regional stations. The Government has promulgated
 the decrees necessary for the operation of private television in Mali, and a number
 of frequencies have been set aside for this use. All that remains is for the Govern-
 
 
 157
 ment to set licensing fees and to distribute the frequencies. Four or five groups are
 already licensed to begin broadcasting, and at least one is in the process of setting
 up its antenna tower.
 There are nearly 50 independent newspapers and journals, in French and local
 languages, including two independent daily papers. The Government does not inter-
 fere with political meetings, which take place openly.
 Although 1993 laws regulating the press provide for substantial penalties, includ-
 ing imprisonment, for slander and for public ijury to the Head of State, other offi-
 cials, and foreign diplomats, the law leaves injury undefined and subject to judicial
 interpretation.
 On November 23, the Government arrested Sambi Toure, the editor in chief of the
 antigovernment daily Nouvel Horizon, on charges of publishing false information
 which threatened national security and the integrity of the defense forces. Mr.
 Toure was released after 10 days on his own recognizance and in a trial in late De-
 cember was acquitted of all charges.
 In a 1993 case in which the President of the Supreme Court sued a newspaper
 publisher for slander, the court found the publisher guilty but levied only a symbolic
 fine of 1 CFA franc.
 Academic freedom is respected.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 the rights of assembly and association. The Government routinely grants permits
 for mass demonstrations. There are dozens of political parties and hundreds of pro-
 fessional and special interest associations. The Constitution forbids the formation of
 political parties based on religion, region, or ethnicity. The Ministry of Territorial
 Administration approves the charter of all political parties. The banned party of
 Moussa Traore, the Democratic Union of the Malian People (UDPM), operates open-
 ly, although it is still not officially recognized by the Government.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-Mali is a secular state. The Government does not dis-
 criminate on religious grounds and citizens are free to practice their faiths. Al-
 though legal restrictions on the Baha'i faith still exist, the Government does not en-
 force them and Baha'i worship freely. The Constitution prohibits discrimination by
 reason of social origin, color, language, sex, religion, or race. The Minister of Terri-
 torial Administration prohibits religious publications which it concludes defame an-
 other religion. There were no known instances of publications being prohibited.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriatIon.-The Government generally does not restrict internal freedom of move-
 ment, although police routinely stop and check both citizens and foreigners, osten-
 sibly to restrict the movement of contraband and to verify vehicle registrations.
 Some police and gendarmes use the occasion to extort bribes. The practice of the
 police accepting small gifts for overlooking infractions, real or imagined, is common
 and has a long tradition.
 There are approximately 13,000 Mauritanian Peuhl refugees settled in Mali. The
 fighting in the north between government troops and Tuareg rebels has generated
 an estimated 100,000 to 120,000 Tuareg and Maur refugees, most of whom fled to
 Mauritania, Algeria, and Burkina Faso. Although Mali has signed repatriation ac-
 cords with all three nations under the auspices of the United Nations High Commis-
 sioner for Refugees, it has not implemented them. The Government does not forcibly
 repatriate refugees.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens have the right to change their government and did so for the first time
 in 1992, voting by secret ballot in elections which were generally free, fair, and
 broad-based, despite some irregularities. In the elections, 21 political parties partici-
 pated; 11 are represented in the National Assembly. The President's party, the As-
 sociation for Democracy in Mali, holds the majority. Nomadic peoples are rep-
 resented-including Fulani (the President of the Assembly) and Tuareg. Tuaregs
 are, of course, also represented in Government.
 Under the Constitution, the President is Chief of State and commander-in-chief
 of the armed forces and is elected for a term of 5 years with a limit of two terms.
 The President appoints the Prime Minister.
 Women are under represented in politics. Only 3 women hold seats in the 116-
 member National Assembly, and 2 Cabinet ministers are women. A third woman,
 the Secretary for the Promotion of Women, holds ministerial rank. There are no re-
 strictions on voting, legal or otherwise, for women or minorities.
 
 
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 There are three independent human rights organizations: the Malian Association
 for Human Rights (AMDH), a smaller Malian League of Human Rights, and a re-
 cently established chapter of Amnesty International. All operate openly and without
 interference from the Government. AMDH criticized government policy toward stu-
 dent protests and treatment of students protesting (often violently) for larger schol-
 arships.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 Women.-The Constitution prohibits discrimination based on sex and provides for
 the basic rights of all persons. The Government respects these rights in practice,
 but social and cultural factors give men a dominant role. Women's access to jobs
 in the professions and government is limited, as are economic and educational op-
 portunities. The Government, the major employer, pays women the same as men for
 similar work. Women often live under harsh conditions, especially in the rural
 areas, where they perform hard farm work and do most of the childrearing. Despite
 legislation giving women equal rights regarding property, traditional practice and
 ignorance of the law prevent women from taking full advantage of this reform.
 There are numerous active women's groups that promote the rig ts of women and
 children, and the female head of the Commission for the Promotion of Women en-
 joys the rank of minister. Women have very limited access to legal services. They
 are particularly vulnerable in cases of divorce, child custody, and inheritance rights,
 as well as in general protection of civil rights. Violence against women, including
 wife beating, is tolerated and pervasive.
 Children.-There is no constitutional or legal provision to protect the interests
 and rights of children, and no juvenile court system. However, the Malian Social
 Services Department investigates and intervenes in cases of reported child abuse or
 neglect. Oniy one in five children receives basic education.
 Female genital mutilation (FGM), widely condemned by international health ex-
 perts as damaging to both physical and psychological health, is still common, espe-
 cially in rural areas, and is performed on girls at an early age. According to an
 international expert, 75 percent of women have undergone this mutilation. The Gov-
 ernment has not proposed legislation prohibiting FGM. It supports educational ef-
 forts to eliminate the practice through seminars and conferences and provides media
 access to proponents of its elimination.
 People With Disabilities.-There is no specific legislation protecting the rights of
 the physically disabled or mentally handicapped, nor mandating accessibility. The
 physically disabled are not discriminated against in access to employment, edu-
 cation, and other state services. Given the high unemployment rate, however, the
 physically disabled are often unable to find work.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Associaton.-The Constitution and the Labor Code specifically
 provide for the freedom of workers to form or join unions and protect freedom of
 association. Only the military, the gendarmerie, and the Republican Guard are ex-
 cluded from forming unions. An unofficial union of noncommissioned officers struck
 for 3 days; the Government took no punitive action taken against it or its members.
 The police also formed a union, affiliated with the National Union of Malian Work-
 ers (UNTM) Confederation. Virtually all salaried employees are organized. Workers
 have established independent unions for teachers, magistrates, health workers, and
 senior civil servants. The UNTM has maintained its autonomy from the current
 Government.
 The Constitution provides for the right to strike, although there are restrictions
 in some areas. For example, civil service and workers in state-owned enterprises
 must give 2 weeks' notice of a planned strike and must enter into negotiations with
 the employer and a third party, usually the Ministry of Labor. Workers receive no
 pay for the time they are on strike. The Labor Code prohibits retribution against
 strikers. Most strikes have involved government employees, and the Government
 made no attempt to retaliate. Unions are free to associate with and participate in
 international bodies.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectiely.-True collective bargaining
 does not take place. The growth of independent unions has led to more direct bar-
 gaining between these unions and their employers. Wages and salaries, however, for
 those workers belonging to the UNTM unions are set by tripartite negotiations be-
 tween the Ministry of Labor, labor unions, and representatives of the federation of
 employers of the sector to which the wages apply. These negotiations usually set the
 
 
 159
 pattern for unions outside the UNTM. The Ministry of Labor acts as a mediator in
 abr disputes.
 Neither the Constitution nor the Labor Code addresses the question of antiunion
 discrimination, but there have been no reports or complaints oT antiunion behavior
 or activities. If the parties cannot come to agreement, the dispute goes to the Labor
 Court for decision.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition  Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Constitution prohibits forced
 or compulsory labor. However, reports of de facto slavery persist, especially in the
 extremely remote salt mining communities north of Timbuktu.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Chidren.-The minimum legal age for em-
 ployment is 14, but children may work with parents'_prmission as apprentices at
 age 12. This regulation is often ignored in practice. Moreover, it has no effect on
 the vast number of children whe work in rura areas, helping with family farms and
 herds and in the informal sector, e.g, street vending. These children are not pro-
 tected by laws against unjust compensation, excessive hours, or capricious dis-
 charge. The Labor Inspection Service of the Ministry of Labor is responsible for, and
 reasonably effective in, enforcement of child labor laws, but only in the modern sec-
 tor.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The Labor Code specifies conditions of employ-
 ment, including hours, wages, and social securi, but in practice many employers
 either ignore or do not comply completely with the regulations. The nation  mini-
 mum wage rate is approximately $40 per month (21,000 CFA francs). Workers paid
 on a daily basis receive a rate of $1.80 (1,000 CFA francs). Workers must be paid
 overtime for additional hours. The minimum wage is supplemented by a required
 package of benefits, including social security and health care benefits. While this
 total package could provide a minimum standard of living for one person, in practice
 most wage earners support large extended families and must supplement their in-
 come by some subsistence farming or work in the informal sector.
 The normal legal workweek is 40 hours, with a requirement for at least one 24-
 hour rest period: The Social Security Code provides a broad range of legal protec-
 tions against hazards in the workplace, and workers' groups have brought pressure
 on employers to respect parts of the regulations, particularly those affecting per-
 sonal hygiene. With unemployment high, however workers are often reluctant to re-
 port violations of occupational safety.The Labor Inspection Service of the Ministry
 of Labor oversees these standards, but limits enforcement to the modern, formal sec-
 tor. Workers have the right to remove themselves from dangerous work situations
 and request an investigation by the Social Security Department, which is respon-
 sible for recommending remedial action where deemed necessary.
