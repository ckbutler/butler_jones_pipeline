 HUNGARY
 Hungary is a parliamentary democracy with a freely elected legislative assembly.
 Prime Minister Viktor Orban, the leader of the FIDESZ-Hungarian Civic Party,
 heads a  calition Government formed after elections in May byFIDESZ, the Inde-
 pendent Smallholders' Party, and the Hungarian Democratic Forum. The Govern-
 ment respects the constitutional provisions for an independent-judiciary. - -
 The internal and external security services report directly to a minister without
 ortfolio, 6nd -the police report to the Interior Minister. There continued to be credi-
 9le reports of police abuses, although their frequency has declined compared-'with
 previous years.
 Through its macroeconomic policies and extensive privatization, the Government
 demonstrated its commitment to the transition to a market economy. The private
 sector generates about 80 percent of gross domestic product. 'Srvices, trade, and
 government employ about 63 percent of the labor force, and industry nearly 30 per-
 cent. Major exports include manufactured goods-(34 percent) and machinery and
 transport equipment (50 percent). 'An estimated 25 percent of th e population live in
 poverty, with elderiy pensioners, dependent housewives and children, and Roma
 most affectd. Romani leaders and civic organizations claim that socioeconomic con-
 ditions for the Romani minority have worsened since the change of regime in 1989.
 The Government generaliy respected the human rights and civil liberties of its
 citizens; however, there were problems in some areas. Although the authorities ad-
 dressed problems in specific cases, police continued to use excessive force against
 suspects. Police also harassed and abused both Roma and foreign nationals. In prac-
 ticethe authorities do not always ensure due process in all cases. Prosecutors and
 judges may impose what amounts to unlimited pretrial detention, although the Gov-
 ernment expanded legal provisions for the right to fair trial. Police on occasion enter
 private residences without warrants to check foreigners'-identification. -
 The electronic media are a mix of state-owned and privately owned radio and tele-
 vision. Opposition politicians and some journalists criticized what they termed the
 Government's "media monopoly,'- the constraints it purportedly imposes on press
 freedom- by economic pressure, and its' discrimination against conservative media.
 However, there is no evidence of government interference with editorial content. So-
 cietal discrimination against Roma remains a serious problem. Anti-Semitic-and rac-
 ist attacks continued to decline. Spousal abuse of women, sexual harassment, and
 discrimination in the job market remain serious problems. Steps were implemented
 to improve the rights, of women and persons with disabilities.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.--There were no reports of political or
 other extrajudicial killings.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 No known incidents of torture occurred. Police abuses continued, including harass-
 ment, use of excessive force, and beatings of suspects. Police also continued to har-
 ass and physically abuse Roma and foreign nationals. A total of 114 police officers
 were accused of physical abuse in 1997. The figure for the first half of 1998 was
 slightly higher, with 60 officers accused of abuse. Between 10 ahd 15 percent-of
 these cases result in prosecution and conviction. Punishment included fines, proba-
 tion, and the imposition of suspended sentences. In 1997 the Budapest central dis-
 trict court sentenced four police officers to 1 to 2% years in prison for the exception-
 ally severe beating of a detainee under interrogation. The appeals court suspended
 the sentences, and three out of the four officers continue to serve as police officers.
 According to a report by the Hungarian Helsinki Committee, persons detained by
 police complain of abuse, but very few file official complaints because they do not
 expect positive results and fear that the complaint may affect their cases adversely.
 Before the national elections in-May, two bombs exploded at the homes of leading
 opposition politicians; no one was injured (see Section 3).-
 The police and Interior -Ministry are working to change the police's authoritarian
 image, and human rights organizations report that police are generally more cooper-
 ative with outside monitoring of police behavior. These efforts are hampered, how-
 
 
 1299
 ever, by low salaries and a lack of physical resources. A 1997 study by the ombuds-
 man's office, which investigates constitutional violations in- the public sector, con-
 demned police corruption but noted that it was unsurprising that it existed, given
 police officers' low pay and poor working conditions. The ombudsman found that
 working conditions in the vast majority of police offices were unsuitable.
 Police frequently harass residents,,charging questionable fines for erroneous traf-
 fic violations to earn petty cash. Police showed indifference towards foreigners who
 have been victims of street crime.
 Prisons are overcrowded but meet minimum international standards. The prison
 population of 14,342 in September was approximately 40 percent over prison capac-
 ity. The prison population increased 7 percent over -1997. According to officials, the
 general health of prisoners declined in the last few years. In 1997 26 prison inmates
 died of terminal diseases and 5 inmates, committed suicide. The chief ombudsman
 issued a report on prison conditions in 1997 that is expected to lead to the closure
 of the Veszprem prison as soon as a new facility is built. The report included a sur-
 vey among prisoners about alleged abuse, which concluded that abuse by prison per-
 sonnel was not a problem.
 The Government permits visits by human rights monitors.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, -or Exile.-Police must inform suspects upon arrest
 of.the charges against them but may hold them for a maximum of 72 hours before
 -filing charges. The law requires that.all suspects be allowed access to counsel prior
 to questioning and throughout all subsequent proceedings. iThe authorities must
 provide counsel for juveniles, the indigent, and the mentally disabled. Credible re-
 ports suggest that police do not always allow access to counsel, particularly for
 minor crimes. Bail is to be available when a new Criminal Code enters into force
 in January 2000.
 The Police Act-permits police to hold suspects in public security detention (PSD)
 in cases in which the suspect has no identity papers; in which blood or urine tests
 must be performed to determine blood alcohol content; or if the suspect continues
 to commit a misdemeanor offense in spite of prior warning. Suspects may be held
 in PSD for up to 24 hours. Such detainees are not always informed of the charges
 against them, because such periods of "short" detention are not defined as "criminal
 detention" And so are not considered to be covered by the Criminal Code.
 Pretrial detention, based on a warrant issued by a judge, is initially limited to
 1 year while criminal investigations are in progress; it may be extended indefinitely
 on the prosecutor's motion (provided the judge concurs). According to the new Crimi-
 -nal Procedure Law, pretrial detention is to be limited to a maximum of 3 years,
 after which the case expires automatically if formal charges are not brought. The
 lack of a bail system gives tremendous leeway to the judge. In 1996 the average
 length of pretrial detention was 3 to 6 months, although nearly 10 percent of detain-
 ees were held for periods ranging from 8 to 12 months. In addition, foreigners usu-
 ally are held until their trial since they are considered likely to flee the country.
 Roma allege that they are kept in pretrial detention longer and more frequently
 than non-Roma (see Section I.e.). The law provides for compensation when a de-
 tainee is released for lack of evidence, but the procedure rarely is exercised since
 detainees must undertake a complicated legal procedure.to pursue their claims.
 The law does not provide for exile, and it is not employed.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution provides-for an independent judi-
 ciary, and the-Government respects this provision in practice. The judiciary provides
 citizens with a fair, although sometimes slow, process. Counsel is appointed for indi-
 gent clients, but public defenders are poorly paid and do not give indigent defend-
 ants priority; lawyers often meet such clients for the first time at trial.
 Under the Constitution, the courts are responsible for the administration of jus-
 tice, with the Supreme Court exercising control over the operations and judicature
 of all the courts. There are three levels of courts. Original jurisdiction in most mat-
 ters rests with the local courts. Appeals of their rulings may be made to the county
 courts or to the Budapest municipal court, which have original jurisdiction in other
 matters. The highest leveL of appeal is the Supreme Court, whose decisions on non-
 constitutional issues are binding. In the case of military trials, appeals also may be
 addressed to the Supreme Court. A fourth level of courts is to be created when the
 new Criminal Procedure Law goes into effect in January 2000. A new. court of ap-
 peal is to be inserted between the metropolitan/county court -and the Supreme
 Court. Established 'initially in Budapest, Szeged, and Pecs, these courts are de-
 signed to alleviate the -current backlog of court cases and-permit lower courts to
 hear simple cases. Critics of the new system charge that it would instead slow court
 procedures and -increase costs. A National Judicial Council (NJC) was established
 in 1997 to nominate judicial appointees and oversee the judicial budget process. The
 NJC will also oversee the implementation of the fourth level of courts. Although
 
 
 1300
 passed and signed by Parliament, the Government delayed indefinitely the imple-
 mentation of the new level of courts, citing budgetary constraints. ,
 The Constitutional Court is charged with reviewing the constitutionality of laws
 and statutes brought before it. Citizens may appeal directly to the Constitutional
 Court if they believe that their constitutional rights have been violated. Parliament
 elects the Court's members for 9-year terms, which may be renewed. The retirement
 age of -the Constitutional Court judges is 70 years. -The mandates of 6 of the 11
 judges expire before June 1999, which has led to concerns that vacancies on the
 bench could delay the Court's-work. Parliament debated -lifting the retirement age
 of judges, but at year's end had made no decision. No judge or member of the Sn-
 preme or Constitutional Courts may belong to a political party or engage in political
 activity. Although the Government alleged that judges' political attitudes affected
 decisions, these charges are undercut by unanimous decisions in controversial cases.
 - The law provides for the right to a fair trial, and the authorities respected this
 right in practice. In selected cases judges may agree:-to a closed trial to protect the
 accused or the crime victim, such as in some rape cases. There is no jury system;
 hence judges are the final arbiters. Under the new Criminal Procedure Law, pros-
 ecutors will have greater influence over their cases. Plea bargaining, which does not
 exist under the-current system, is to be available to prosecutors.'
 Military trials follow civil law and may-be closed if.national security or moral
 grounds so justify. In all cases, sentencing must take place publicly. Defendants are
 entitled to-counsel during all phases of criminal proceedings and are presumed inno-
 cent until-proven guilty. Judicial proceedings are generally investigative rather than
 adversarial in nature.         ; , . I                                       ,
 Many-human rights and Romani organizations claim that Roma receive less than
 equal treatment in the judicial process. Specifically, they allege that Roma are kept
 in pretrial detention more often and for longer periods of time than non-Roma. This
 allegation is credible in light of general discrimination against Romi;however, there
 is no statistical evidence because identifying the ethnicity bf-offenders is not allowed
 under the data protection law.
 --There were no reports of political prisoners.  -
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The law
 provides that the prosecutor's office -may issue search warrants. Police must carry
 out house searches in the presence-of two witnesses and must prepare a written in-
 ventory 'of, items removed from. the premises. Wiretapping,, which may be done for
 national security -reasons and for legitimate criminal investigations, requires a
 court's permission. These provisions appear to be observed in practice. However, po-
 lice at times enter private residences without 'warrants to check foreigners' identi-
 fication.
 In August Prime Minister Orban stated that FIDESZ politicians and their faini-
 lies were the targets of illegal secret surveillance in 1997. Orban claimed that the
 investigators, whose identity he did not reveal, sought damaging information to use
 in the spring 1998 elections. Opposition (former government) leaders vigorously de-
 nied the accusatiois. An investigation was ongoing at year's end.-
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Ircluding: ,
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech
 and of the press, and the- Government respects this right in practice. All the major
 print media-national and regional newspapers, magazines, and tabloids-are in
 private hands, some as part of foreign media companies. The print media enjoy con-
 siderable freedom; however, journalists and opposition politicians are concerned that
 the expression of different views in the press may-be circumscribed by the small
 number of owners who control most of the print media.
 Parliament passed a media law in 1995 creating institutions designed to foster
 a free and independent electronic media. The law provided for the creation of na-
 tionwide commercial television and radio and insulated the remaining public service
 media.from- government control. In June the Government awarded licenses for the
 new privatized television channels- that began broadcasting in October, licenses for
 commercial radio were awarded in November, and the stations are expected to begin
 broadcasting in early 1999.
 The regulatory body -created by the 1995 law, the National Television and Radio
 Board (ORTT), was accused during its first year and a half of operation of political
 bias in awarding television licenses. Others have criticized ORTT for its attempts
 to acquire a share of the National Broadcasting, Company, thereby becoming an
 owner in the industry it regulates. Two lawsuits have been filed against the Board,
 in both. cases raising the question of whether the Board truly is insulated from poli-
 tics and conflicts of interest as intended by the law.
 Academic freedom is generally respected.
 
 
 1301
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-There are essentially no re-
 strictions on peaceful public gatherings. In general the Government does not require
 permits for assembly except when a public gathering is to take place near sensitive
 installations, such as military facilities, embassies, or key government buildings. Po-
 lice may sometimes alter or revoke permits, but there is no evidence that they abuse
 this right.
 Any 10 or more persons may form an association, provided that it does not com-
 mit criminal offenses or disturb the rights of others. Associations with charters and
 elected officers must register with the courts.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and
 members of all faiths are allowed to practice their religion freely. There are 79 offi-
 cially recognized churches. There is no preferred religion, although only 59 of the
 officially recognized churches received government subsidies in 1997. State support
 for churches amounted to $5.4 million (Huf 1.2 billion). A 1996 law permits citizens
 to donate 1 percent of their income tax to the church or nonprofit agency of their
 choice. In 1997 only 1 percent of the total donated went to churches. The majority
 was donated to schools and animal welfare groups. In 1997 the Government signed
 a treaty with the Vatican to return church property confiscated by the Communist
 regime; the treaty also provided for a minimum state subsidy to the Catholic
 Church of $7.8 million (Huf 1.7 billion). Similar compacts are expected to be nego-
 tiated with the country's three other largest churches. Religious orders and schools
 have regained some property confiscated by the Communist regime.
 In 1997 Parliament established the Jewish Heritage Foundation to provide res-
 titution in the form of life pensions to 17,800 Holocaust survivors born after May
 9, 1945. An additional 2,040 persons are to receive pensions automatically when
 they reach 60 years of age. In a 1998 agreement with the Jewish community on con-
 fiscated properties, the Government made a compensatory payment of $2.7 million
 (Huf 600 milo)and returned nine properties.
 Several synagogues have been built since World War II, generally replacing older
 demolished synagogues. The first completely new synagogue built since the war was
 constructed during the year at a Jewish summer camp in Szarvas.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-There are no restrictions on the movement of citizens within or outside
 the country, including on the rights of emigration and repatriation. However, local
 authorities have in some cases   tio expel Roma from towns or to induce Roma
 to live in the equivalent of ghettos. The Government may delay but not deny emi-
 gration for those who have significant court-assessed debts or who possess state se-
 crets. It requires that foreigners from countries that do not have a visa waiver
 agreement with Hungary obtain exit visas each time they leave the country, al-
 though blanket permission is sometimes available. In August the police chief in
 Bacs-Kiskun County ordered a 30-day limit on the validity of visitor passes for for-
 eigners arriving at the county's Yugoslav-Hungarian border. Critics charged that
 the police chief did not have the authority to impose such a limit.
 Refugees numbering 4,469 from the former Yugoslavia are registered in Hungary.
 Most are in private housing, with only 500 housed in 3 refugee camps. The Govern-
 ment estimates that there are as many as 60,000 immigrants (the vast majority
 from Romania) living in the country in unregistered status, although the local office
 of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (     tCR) believes that this
 figure is too high.
 The Government provides first asylum and cooperates with the local office of
 UNHCR and other humanitarian organizations assisting refugees. The number of
 people who received refugee status increased from 27 in 1997 to 270 for the first
 7 months of 1998. Over one-half of the 1998 refugees were from Afghanistan. The
 higher number of refugees was attributable to the new law that went into effect in
 March lifting Hungary's geopolitical reservation to the 1951 Geneva Convention.
 Under the old law, the Government only handled claims from European asylum-
 seekers, and the UNHCR handled all other claims. Compared with cases formerly
 adjudicated by the UNECR, the total number of refugee claims was similar to ear-
 lier years. Applications for refugee status increased from 177 to 1997 to 2,223 for
 the frst 7 months of 1998; this total increase also was comparable with cases for-
 merly adjudicated by the UNHCR. Prospective refugees who seek only to transit to
 Western Europe are encouraged to retun to their countries of departure. There
 were 1,324 asylum seekers located in 4 refugee camps as of September.
 Aliens caught trying to cross the border illegally may apply for refugee status or
 are housed temporarily at one of eight border guard facilities throughout the coun-
 try pending deportation. At any time there are between 500 to 600 people in the
 facilities. Overall, 8,572 illegal aliens were expelled in the first 6 months of 1998,
 compared to 7,145 for the first 6 months of 1997, a 17 percent increase. While police
 
 
 1302
 seek the- timely deportation of detainees who do not qualify for refugee status, a
 shortage of funds and the detainees' lack of property or documentation, such as
 passports, often result in lengthy stays. There were no reports of the forced return
 of persons to a country where they feared persecution.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens age 18 and over have the right to change their government through na-
 tional elections held at least every 4 years. Members of Parliament are elected
 through a complex voting procedure for individuals and party lists. In the May na-
 tional elections the FIDESZ-Hungarian Civic Party formed a new government in co-
 alition with the Independent Smallholders' Party and the Hungarian Democratic
 Forum. The opposition includes the extreme rightwing Hungarian Truth and Life
 Party (MIEP) and two leftw-ing parties, the Hungarian Socialist Party and the Free
 Democrats.
 Before the national elections in May, two bombs exploded at the homes of leading
 opposition politicians; no one was injured. No one claimed responsibility for the
 bombings (see Section 1.c.).
 No legal impediments hinder women's participation in government or the political
 process: 33 of 386 parliamentary deputies are women and 1 woman serves in the
 Cabinet. Few women occupy other leadership positions in the Government or politi-
 cal parties. Despite the lack of guaranteed minority representation, several minori-
 ties are represented in the Parliament, including one ethnic German and one ethnic
 Slovak. There are no Romani Members of Parliament.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Numerous human rights organizations operate without government restriction or
 interference. Many nongovernmental organizations (NGO's) report that the Govern-
 ment is generally responsive to their requests for information. However, individual
 police units and prosecutors reportediy are uncooperative at times, particularly in
 cases involving ,Roma or police abuses. Some NGO' also reported attempted intimi-
 dation aind harassment by the police. There is also a 21-member parliamentary
 Committee for Human, Minority, and Religious rights.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution provides for individual rights, equality, and protection against
 discrimination, but in practice discrimination still exists, particulariy against Roma.
 Women.-Spousal abuse is believed to be common, but the vast majority of such
 abuse is not reported, and victims who step forward often receive little help from
 authorities. While' there are laws against rape, often it is unreported for cultural
 reasons. Police attitudes towards victims of sexual abuse are often reportedly un-
 sympathetic, particularly if the victim was acquainted with her abuser. New laws
 passed ini 1997 recognize rape within marriage and increase the penalties for six
 other crimes. Women's rights organizations claim that 1 woman in 10 is a victim
 of spousal abuse and that societal attitu'des towards spousal abuse are "archaic."
 The Government statistics office reported 392 rapes nationwide in 1997 and 154 for
 the first 6 months of 1998; in- addition, there were 2,162 cases reported of assaults
 against women in 1997 and 1,127 cases of assault for the first 6 months of 1998.
 Legally, women have the same rights as men, including identical inheritance and
 property rights. While there is no overt discrimination against women, the number
 of women in middle or upper managerial positions in business and government is
 low. Women are heavily representd in the judiciary and in the medical and teach-
 ing professions.                                    "
 The law does not prohibit sexual harassment in the work place. A 1995 report
 prepared under the auspices of the U.N. to evaluate compliance with the Convention
 on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women termed sexual harassment in
 the workplace as "virtually epidemic." Women's groups report that there is little
 Support fori efforts to criminalize sexual harassment and that harassment is toler-
 ated by women who fear unempi yment more than harassment. In the first case of
 its kind, a woman won her court case after sulng-a potential employer for sex dis-
 crimination after the employer advertised for men only. A Women's Secretariat is
 being established in the Ministry of Social and Family Affairs to address women's
 issues better.                    ..
 Children.-The Government is committed to children's rights. Education is man-
 datory through 16 years of age, and employment is illegal below therae of 15. There
 is no societal pattern of child abuse, although NGO report that neglect and abuse
 are common in state care facilities. The national police reported 598 cases of vio-
 
 
 1303
 lence against children and 58 rapes in 1997, and 340 cases of violence and 25 rapes
 for the first 6 months of 1998.
 People With Disabilities.-A law that was passed in March requires that all public
 buildings be made -accessible to the disabled within 10 years. At present services
 for the disabled are limited, and most buildings are not wheelchair accessible. A
 1997 decree requires all companies that employ over 20 persons to reserve 5 percent
 of their jobs for the physically or mentally disabled, with fines of up to 75 percent
 of the average monthly salary for noncompliance.
 Religious Minorities.-A case is pending against Enrem Kemal arising from two
 inflammatory anti-Semitic speeches he made in 1997. In April a court in Heves sen-
 tenced Istvan Osze to 10 months' imprisonment for assaulting Tamas Horvath, who
 falsely claimed to be Jewish. The conviction was the first for a racist assault.
 In 1997 changes to the Penal Code made it easier to enforce and stiffen penalties
 for hate -crimes committed on the basis of the victim's ethnicity, race, or nationality.
 National /Racial/Ethnic Minorities.The 1993 Law    on Ethnic and Minority
 Rights establishes the concept of collective rights of minorities and states that mi-
 norities need special rights in order to preserve their ethnic identities. It explicitly
 permits organized forms of limited self-government in areas where ethnic groups
 constitute a majority and states that the establishment of self-governing bodies
 must be made possible in localities where an ethnic group constitutes less than a
 majority of the population. The law permits associations, movements, and political
 parties of an ethnic or national character and mandates the unrestricted use of eth-
 nic languages. Only those ethnic groups that have lived within the country's present
 borders for at least 100 years and whose members are citizens may obtain recog-
 nized status under this law.
 On this basis, the law specifically grants minority status to 13 ethnic or national
 groups. Other groups may petition the Chairman of Parliament for inclusion if they
 include at least 1,000 citizens and have their own language and culture.
 There were 770 Romani minority self-governments elected in the local elections
 in October, a significant increase over the 477 elected self-governments in the first
 minority elections held in 1994. The new self-governments are to begin operating
 in January 1999. Of the 477 elected in 1994, 396 are still functioning;, the discrep-
 ancy reflected the number that ceased functioning between 1994 and 1998 due to
 a lack of funds. With funding from the central budget of $75 million (Huf 1.5 billion)
 in 1997 and logistical support from local governments, these bodies seek to influence
 and oversee matters affecting minorities. However, the national minority self-gov-
 ernment bodies elected in 1994 had only limited success. The non-Romani minorities
 appear to be the most satisfied, while Romani leaders express frustration with the
 self-governments' lack of clear authority, responsibility, or resources. Critics of the
 minority self-governments claim that, or the Roma, the system failed, in part be-
 cause it has permitted local governments to abdicate responsibility for their poorest
 inhabitants while the under-funded minority self-governments cannot meet ade-
 quately the needs of this population.
 In 1995 Parliament appointed an Ombudsman-currently an ethnic German-
 specifically charged with defending minority rights.
 Roma constitute at least 4 percent of the population; Germans, the second largest
 minority group, constitute about 2 percent. Smaller communities of Slovaks, Croats,
 Romanians, Poles, Ukrainians, Greeks, Serbs, Slovenes, Armenians, Ruthenians,
 and Bulgarians are recognized as ethnic minorities.
 Education is available to varying degrees in almost all minority languages. There
 are minority-language print media, and the state-run radio broadcasts 2-hour daily
 programs in the mother tongue of major nationalities, i.e., Romani, Slovak,_Roma-
 nian, German, Croatian, and Serbian. State-run television carries a 30-minute pro-
 gram for the larger minority groups, complemented by 5-minute weekly news bul-
 letins. The newly privatized television stations also carry weekly programs for eth-
 nic minorities.
 Conditions of-life for the Romani -ommunity are significantly worse than among
 the general population. Roma-suffer from discrimination and racist attacks and are
 considerably less. educated, with lower than average incomes and life expectancy.
 The unemployment rate for Roma is estimated to be 70 percent, over seven times
 the national average. With unemployment-benefit exhausted,and social services
 stretched thin, Roma often confront desperate situations.
 Roma continue to suffer widespread discrimination in education, housing, and ac-
 cess to public institutions, including restaurants- and pubs. Roma and other civic or-
 ganizations highlighted the practice of placing Roma children in remedial education
 programs designed for  idren with disabilities or low academic performance, re-
 sulting in a form of de facto segregation. Although the children could be returned
 to the regular school system, only a small percentage return. Schools for Roma are
 
 
 1304
 more crowded, more poorly equipped, and in markedly poorer condition than those
 attended by non-Roma. The Hugarian Helsinki Committee found that there are
 132 segregated schools throughout the country. The Government contests the claims
 of the human rights organizations and states that the Romani schools are-designed
 toprovide intensive help for disadvantaged children.
 'n what is considered a landmark case, in July a court ordered a bar owner in
 the city of Pecs to pay a $750 fine and take out newspaper advertisement apologiz-
 ing for refusing to serve a Rom.
 Local officials have in some cases taken advantage of rules prohibiting over-
 crowded, unsafe, or unsanitary housing, or have punished nonpayment of utility
 bills by evicting Roma families from residences without providing alternative hous-
 ing as the� law. requires. The Government sponsors prog s both to preserve
 Romani languages and cultural heritage and to assist social and economic assimila-
 tion. Oversight and budgetary control of the Coordination Council for Roma Affairs
 and the Office of National Ethnic Minorities was shifted from the Prime Ministers
 Office tb the Minisr of Justice. In July the Government published an action plan
 designed to improve living conditions in Romani communities, with specific focus on
 public health, education, and work training. However, the plan provide no addi-
 tionial funds; rather, it redistributes already inadequate resources.
 Widespread popuar prejudice against Roma continues. Police commonly abuse
 them (see Section 1.c.). The Helsik Committee recorded two cases of skinhead as-
 saults during theyear(one against a group of Roma, the other against an Asian stu-
 dent). According t press reports, a Sudanese man was attacked in Budapest by four
 skinheads in December. The attackers were arrested and the case is-under inves-
 tigation. Foreigners of color reported harassment by police and at border control
 checkpoints. The Martin Luther King Organization (MLKO) which documents as-
 saults on nonwhites, recorded two such incidents in 1998, a decrease in the number
 of assaults. However, MLKO sources believe that many cases go unreported.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The-1992 Labor Code recognizes the right of unions
 to organize and bargain collectively and 'permits trade union pluralism. Workers
 have the right to associate freely, choose representatives, publish journals, and
 openly promote members' interests and views. With the exception of military per-
 sonnel and police officers, they also have the right to strike. Under a separate 1992
 law, public servants may negtiate working conditions, but the final decision on in-
 creasing salaries rests with Parliament.
 The largest labor union organization is the National Confederation of Hungarian
 Trade Unions, the successor to the former monolithic Communist union, with over
 735,000 members. The Democratic League of Independent Unions and the Federa-
 tion of Workers' Councils have approximately 100,000 and 56,090 members, respec-
 tively.'
 There are no restrictions on trade union contacts with international organizations,
 and unions have developed a wide range of ties with European and international
 trade union bodies.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.The Labor Code permits col-
 lective bargaining at the enterprise and industry level, although the practice is not
 widespread and is actively discouraged in thegrowing private sector. Labor organi-
 zations appear willing to cooperate with one another, and thisis particularly evi-
 dent in thei relationship in forums such as the National Interest Reconciliation
 Couincil (ET), which provides a forum for tripartite consultation among representa-
 tives from management, employees, and the Government. The ET discusses issues
 such as wage increases and the setting of the minimum-wage, which is centrally
 negotiated within the ET in order to control inflation: Individual trade unions add
 management may negotiate highei- wages at the plant level. The new Government
 disbanded the Ministry of Labor and split its work between the Ministry of Economy
 (covering policy issues) and the newly reated Ministry of Social and Famly Affairs
 (covering employment issues and responsible for drafting labor-related legislation).
 Employers are prohibited from discrimninating against unions and their organizers.
 The Ministry of Social and Family Affairs enforces this provision.
 There are no export processing zones.           b
 c. Prohibition of Forced 6r Compulsory Labor.-The law prohibits forced or com-
 pulsory labor, including that performed by children, and theMinistry of Social and
 Family Affairs enforces this prohibition.
 d. Status" of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment.-The law
 prohibits forced and bonded labor by children (see Section 6..). The Labor Code for-
 bids labor by children under the age of 15, and regulates labor conditions for minors
 (14 to 16 years of age), including prohibitions on night shifts, hard physical labor,

 and guaranteed overtime payments. The National Labor Center enforces these regu-
 lations.in practice, and there does not appear to be any significant abuse of this
 statute. Education is compulsory through age 16. Roma are far more likely than
 non-Roma to stop attending school before age 16.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The ET establishes the legal minimum wage,
 which is subsequently implemented by Ministry of Social and Family Affairs decree.
 The minimum wage, $90 (Huf 19,500) per month, is insufficient to provide a decent
 standard of living for a worker and family. Many workers supplement their primary
 employment with second jobs.
 The Labor Code specifies various conditions of employment, including termination
 procedures, severance pay, maternity leave, trade union consultation rights in some
 management decisions, annual and sick leave entitlement, and labor conflict resolu-
 tion procedures. Under the Code, the official workday is set at 8 hours; however,
 it may vary depending upon the nature of the industry. A 24-hour rest period is re-
 quired during any 7-day period.
 Labor courts and the Ministry of Social and Family Affairs enforce occupational
 safety standards set by the Government, but specific safety conditions are generally
 not consonant with internationally accepted standards. The enforcement of occupa-
 tional safety standards-is not always effective in part due to the limited resources
 the Ministry of Labor is able to commit to enforcement. In theory, workers have the
 right to remove themselves from dangerous work situations without jeopardy to con-
 tinued employment.
