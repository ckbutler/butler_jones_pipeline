 CHILE
 The October 5 presidential plebiscite was a key event in
 Chile's recent history and an important step in putting Chile
 on the road to democracy. In that plebiscite, Chileans were
 asked to vote on whether President Augusto Pinochet, the
 candidate selected by the ruling military junta, should
 continue to rule until 1997. With 92 percent of the adult
 population registered and voting, Pinochet's continuation as
 President was rejected by a margin of 55 to 43 percent (the
 remainder of votes were blank or nullified). Under the terms
 of the 1980 Constitution, this result means that President
 Pinochet will remain in office until March 1990, at which time
 he will be replaced by a successor chosen in direct
 presidential elections to take place on December 14, 1989.
 Those elections will also select the first Congress to be
 permitted since the 1973 coup which brought Pinochet to
 power. Both the new Congress and the President will assume
 office on March 11, 1990.
 There was vigorous political debate during the campaign
 leading up to the plebiscite, although the political
 opposition was denied balanced media coverage and had only
 limited funding. The vote itself was an impressive
 affirmation of the Chilean people's desire to return to
 democracy. The large number of international observers who
 witnessed the voting reported that it was conducted in a
 peaceful, orderly, and free manner. However, there were
 various forms of intimidation and pressure applied to
 government employees.
 The current Government includes both military and civilian
 officials and operates under the 1980 Constitution, which was
 adopted by plebiscite. The military Junta exercises the
 legislative function, and there is a separate judicial branch,
 but primary authority resides with the Commanding General of
 the Army and President Augusto Pinochet.
 The uniformed national police, the 28,000-man Carabineros, is
 Chile's largest police force-and is under the control of the
 Minister of Defense. The Carabineros have primary
 responsibility for public security and safety, crime control,
 and border security. The 5,000-man Investigations Police,
 also under the jurisdiction of the Minister of Defense, are
 responsible for controlling and investigating serious crime.
 The National Information Center (CNI), responsible for
 lnternal and external intelligence-gathering, is part of the
 Ministry of Interior, but the presidency exercises significant
 de facto control. The majority of this 2,500-man force is
 composed of military personnel. The 85,000-man armed forces
 is the ultimate guarantor of constitutional order. During the
 October plebiscite, the armed forces were responsible for the
 security of the voting places.
 Chile's export-oriented economy is largely based on free
 market principles. After a major recession in 1982-83, during
 which real incomes and employment dropped sharply, the economy
 has grown steadily and rapidly. The year 1988 marked the
 fifth consecutive year of positive real growth and the third
 consecutive year of annual growth in excess of 5 percent. As
 a result, real wages have increased and unemployment, on the
 whole, has decreased. However, unemployment remains high in
 urban areas and, while per capita income has risen, income
 distribution problems remain. Chile has made substantial
 progress in overcoming its debt problem.

 CHILE
 Many fundamental human rights remain restricted in Chile.
 Freedom from arbitrary arrest is undermined by extensive use
 of vaguely defined and far-reaching state security laws. In
 1988, as in the past, there were reliable and in some cases
 documented reports of torture and mistreatment of persons
 detained by security forces or by unidentified groups that
 appeared to be linked to security forces. In addition, there
 were also cases of kidnapings, beating, torture and, in a few
 cases, murders in which no suspects have been identified or
 apprehended. Although the number of such incidents decreased
 compared to. 1987, the absence of any resolution to
 longstanding cases of serious human rights abuses continues to
 concern both Chilean and international organizations.
 Freedom of the press is also curbed, and the media continue to
 be subjected to informal government pressures and
 self-censorship, although access to the media by democratic
 parties improved significantly during 1988. However, new
 judicial measures were taken against journalists for
 publishing news and opinion which military courts found
 objectionable, and a number of cases initiated in 1987 and
 earlier remain pending. (At year's end, the Government took
 action which may result in charges being dropped against 6 of
 these journalists). The growing number of other cases handled
 by the military courts, including the unresolved 1976 murder
 in Washington of Orlando Letelier and Ronni Moffitt, is one of
 the most serious human rights issues.
 However, there were some steps taken during 1988 which
 represent significant progress in the human rights situation.
 On August 24 the last states of exception in effect, the State
 of Emergency and the State of Danger to the Internal Peace,
 were lifted. (The Government still maintains significant
 discretionary authority to limit freedoms by use of one or
 more of the five states of exception provided for in the
 Constitution or its Transitory Articles.) On September 1,
 orders for administrative exile were lifted, and several
 hundred political exiles were permitted to return to Chile.
 The Government continued to cooperate with the Special
 Rapporteur of the United Nations Human Rights Commission
 (UNHRC). Delegations from other human rights organizations,
 such as Amnesty International (AI), Americas Watch, and the
 International Human Rights Law Group, visited Chile during the
 year and in some instances were given permission to visit
 prisons and individual prisoners. The 1987-88 Annual Report
 of the Organization Of American States (OAS) Inter-American
 Commission on Human Rights noted continued shortcomings in
 Chile on torture and ill-treatment, personal liberty, judicial
 procedures, and freedom of expression.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 Deaths and injuries resulting from political violence
 continued during 1988. According to the Vicariate of
 Solidarity, the human rights organization of the Catholic
 Church, 27 persons had died in acts of political violence as
 of October 31. The independent Chilean Human Rights
 Commission (CHRC) indicates that 25 deaths had occurred due to
 political violence during the same period. (For a discussion
 
 
 481
 CHILE
 of the bases of the statistics provided by these two groups,
 see Section 4.) The deaths resulted from both deliberate or
 random actions by persons still unidentified. Of the 27
 deaths listed by the Vicariate as politically motivated, 9 of
 the victims were members of the military and security forces.
 An ad hoc Carabinero prosecutor was appointed in May to
 investigate the cases of five police officials who were
 assassinated by unknown persons. One police officer was
 killed by what appeared to be a command-detonated bomb while
 responding to a bomb-threat call; another was killed while
 attempting to arrest a suspected member of the Manuel
 Rodriguez Patriotic Front (FPMR), a leftist group that
 advocates violence.
 Of the civilian deaths, three persons died when a bomb in
 their possession exploded, and one woman died in an explosion
 at a medical clinic. Others listed as victims of politically
 motivated violence by the Vicariate included three persons
 killed during an attack on an armored car, a young man shot by
 a retired Carabinero official during a political demonstration,
 and a young man struck by police and left unattended during a
 demonstration. During the night of August 30, following
 President Pinochet's nomination as the Government's candidate
 for the plebiscite, three persons in poor neighborhoods were
 shot by unidentified assailants; two of the victims were in
 their early teens. Several people were also killed during
 demonstrations before and after the plebiscite. On October
 21, a Carabinero official was killed in an attack on a small
 rural police station. A self-described spokesman for the
 FPMR, in a call to a newspaper, termed that attack and another
 on a similar police post as the start of a campaign to
 destablize the Government in the postplebiscite period.
 According to government reports, terrorist groups in 1988
 caused 16 deaths and 97 personal injuries in attacks which
 included 368 bombings. Rightwing terrorist groups such as the
 Chilean Anti-Communist Association (ACHA), the September 11
 Command, and the National Combat Front (FNC) continued to
 operate, but there were no deaths attributed to them in 1988.
 In January a Carabinero official was found guilty of killing a
 student in April 1985 and was given a 3-year suspended.
 sentence. Despite the leniency of the sentence, the Vicariate
 noted this was the first instance in 15 years in which a
 security official was convicted for a human rights violation.
 In December an army officer was found guilty by a military
 prosecutor of manslaughter in the 1986 death by burning of
 Rodrigo Rojas, a young Chilean who had lived in the United
 States. A sentence of 541 days in jail was recommended. The
 verdict and sentence must be confirmed by the military court,
 which had not acted by year's end.
 b. Disappearance
 Human rights organizations report that politically motivated
 kidnapings and threats by private or paramilitary groups
 continued in 1988. Some reports assert that the method of
 operation, type of equipment used, and intelligence apparently
 available to the groups strongly suggest some had government
 support. Kidnapings continue--CHRC data show 49 kidnapings as
 of October 31, while Vicariate figures show 11 kidnapings in
 Santiago as of August 31. As in past years, there were no
 known arrests-or prosecutions in any of these kidnaping
 cases. Rightwing terrorist groups may have been involved in
 kidnapings as well as in numerous threats against persons
 
 
 486
 CHILE
 associated with political opposition organizations, including
 actors, student leaders, and human rights activists. Charges
 continued to surface that members of the security and military
 forces were involved in some of these terrorist organizations.
 An AI report issued in May claims that Chilean courts still
 refuse to process investigations of hundreds of disappearances
 dating to the mid-1970's. During 1988 there were no reports
 of persons disappearing following detention by security forces
 or by persons suspected of being official security agents.
 Investigations into the last reported case of disippearance,
 of five men in September 1987, are inactive and appear to have
 been suspended.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Torture remains one of the most serious, persistent human
 rights problems in Chile. The Vicariate reported 51 cases
 through October 31; the CHRC reported 98 as of October 31.
 Many undocumented cases periodically surface in the
 international media. Agreements concluded in 1987 by the
 Investigations Police, the CNI, and the Carabineros with the
 International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), however,
 appear to have reduced the incidence of torture and lesser
 forms of police brutality. The agreements, which have
 generally been honored, allow the ICRC to visit anyone
 detained by those three organizations for violations of state
 security laws. They stipulate that the ICRC be provided a
 daily list of detainees, and be allowed to visit the detainees
 after the first 5 days of detention and before the detainees
 are released or brought before the courts. However, the ICRC
 and the Interior Ministry's Advisory Commission on Human
 Rights are not allowed to visit detainees if the prosecutor in
 the case orders them held for 10-day periods of isolation
 under the antiterrorist law. The CNI continued to abide by
 the provision in the 1987 agreement with the ICRC to turn over
 persons it arrested to the Carabineros or the Investigations
 Police. The U.N. and the O.A.S. Conventions on Torture,
 signed by Chile in 1987, were ratified in September and
 entered into force in November: However, the Government
 attached reservations which have the effect of denying any
 international involvement in ensuring compliance.
 Government officials deny that torture is used or authorized,
 and assert that members of the security forces are always
 investigated in cases of alleged mistreatment. In April two
 Investigations Police members were found guilty of "illegal
 and arbitrary detention" of two persons in 1980 and given a
 sentence of 541 days in jail, which was suspended; the two
 were also ordered to pay compensation of approximately
 $3,570. The judge found the two not guilty of the more
 serious charge of torture. In October a judge in Santiago
 charged six members of the Investigations Police with
 torturing a person arrested in 1986 for involvement in the
 attempted assassination of President Pinochet. The charges
 were overruled by the Santiago Court of Appeals, leaving the
 policemen free. An appeal is pending with the Supreme Court.
 Judicial investigations of torture are seldom concluded, due
 in large part to the refusal of some state security
 organizations to comply with court orders to make security
 agents available to the courts for questioning. Moreover, in
 one case, three Investigations Police detectives found guilty
 in 1986 of the torture death of a young man and sentenced to
 serve 5 years in prison and pay a fine have never done so,
 
 
 487
 CHILE
 despite a Supreme Court order confirming the sentence. Last
 year's Country Reports on Human Rights Practices noted that a
 judge publicly denounced the repeated failure of CNI officials
 to cooperate with his investigations into 35 separate torture
 incidents and that the jurisdiction of some of these
 investigations had been transferred to military prosecutors.
 In February a military judge demanded that the civilian judge
 in the case declare himself incompetent to investigate some 20
 cases of alleged torture by the CNI. In responding to the
 request, the civilian judge opined, as he had in the past,
 that torture cases investigated by military judges implied
 impunity for those charged. In May the Supreme Court
 "admonished" the judge for. using inappropriate language in his
 reply. Moreover, in October the Supreme Court suspended the
 judge for.15 days with half pay for violating the principle
 "that judges should abstain from expressing or even privately
 indicating their opinion regarding cases they are called upon
 to judge."
 In October the Catholic bishop of Copiapo denounced the use of
 electric shocks by Investigations Police in the days following
 the plebiscite. On October 17 an appeals court in Copiapo
 dismissed charges against nine persons accused of violating
 the antiterrorist law, on the grounds that there was clear
 evidence that their confessions had been obtained by torture.
 Human rights leaders agree that Carabinero efforts to conduct
 themselves professionally and to avoid the use of unnecessary
 force continued in 1988. Opposition political figures
 generally agree that Carabinero conduct during legally held
 political demonstrations of both electoral camps was generally
 evenhanded; detentions during rallies were relatively low,
 given the number of participants, and most of those held were
 Leleased within 24 hours. The Carabineros were praised by
 both Chilean and foreign observers of the October 5 plebiscite.
 Activities of some persons in the police force, however,
 detracted from the improving record of the Carabineros.
 During celebratory demonstrations held by opposition forces
 after the plebiscite, excessive force was used in some areas.
 Two officers have been charged with attempted murder for
 beating a youth in demonstrations in Santiago. A Carabinero
 special force unit attacked and beat about 20 Chilean and
 foreign journalists filming political demonstrations on
 October 6 and 7. An internal investigation was under way at
 year's end.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Under Transitory Article 24 of the Constitution, the Government
 may order detention for 5 days without affording a detainee
 the right to a judicial hearing, or for as many as 20 days in
 cases where terrorist acts are alleged to be involved. In
 some cases involving the special military prosecutor, the
 detainees have had their access to lawyers limited even after
 the prosecutor formally charged them. The ad hoc military
 prosecutor continued to order arrests of persons suspected of
 being linked to the four cases under his purview: the
 discovery of an arms cache in 1986, the attempted assassination
 of President Pinochet in 1986, the kidnaping of an army colonel
 in 1987, and the 1986 assault on a bakery in which a Carabinero
 official was killed. None of those arrested in these cases
 have been brought to trial. On December 27, the military
 prosecutor was promoted to the top position in the military
 justice system. On December 28, the Supreme Court overturned
 a decision by the military court that the special prosecutor
 
 
 488
 CHILE
 had exceeded his authority in seeking data from the Vicariate
 of Solidarity.
 The Vicariate of Solidarity reported 752 individual arrests
 and 2,883 group arrests in demonstrations through October 31.
 The Vicariate reported 669' individual and 2,596 collective
 arrests in all of 1987, and 637 individual and 3,969 collective
 arrests in all of 1986. The CHRC reported 636 individual
 arrests and 3,713 collective arrests as of October 31. Only a
 small number of those arrested were arraigned before the
 courts; the vast majority of those detained were released
 without charges, or charged with minor violations.
 Many of those detained under Transitory Article 24 are never
 charged and are released after several days. The state
 security laws often appear to be used to harass opponents of
 the Government. Persons are detained for prolonged periods of
 time while their cases are investigated or released on bail
 without any formal charge against which they can defend
 themselves. Four persons associated with the Vicariate are in
 this position. Moreover, charges are often levied well after
 the event, heightening the impression of arbitrariness and
 harassment. For example, labor leader Manuel Bustos was taken
 from his home at 6 a.m. on January 29 to answer questions
 regarding an alleged attempt to encourage disorder in the
 Armed Forces because of a statement of his which had been
 published in the magazine Analisis the year before. Father
 Jose Aldunate of the Sebastian Acevedo Movement Against
 Torture was similarly detained on October 17 to give a
 statement regarding offenses against the Armed Forces stemming
 from comments in a bulletin published by his organization in
 June 1987.
 Once formally charged with or convicted of violations of state
 security laws, the accused are generally imprisoned separately
 from common criminals and have rights of visitation and
 communication with their families, friends, legal counsel, and
 representatives of the ICRC. The ICRC has access to most of
 those detained under the state security laws after a 5-day
 period of incommunicado detention.
 On September 1, the Government terminated administrative exile
 orders, paving the way for about 300 people, primarily
 political figures and their families, to return to Chile.
 Some who accepted a term of exile as an alternative to a
 prison sentence handed down by a court are eligible to return,
 but if the term of the original sentence has not expired they
 could be subject to imprisonment. Several prominent political
 figures who had been exiled for 15 years returned to Chile.
 Among them were the widow and daughter of former President
 Allende, several of his cabinet officials, and leaders of the
 banned Communist Party. Clodomiro Almeyda, the Foreign
 Minister in the Allende Government who was sentenced to 541
 days in prison for violations of the antiterrorist law and for
 illegally entering the country from exile, was released on
 October 18. The Supreme Court, acting on a petition from his
 lawyers, reduced the sentence to the time he had already
 served in jail.
 On August 17, the Supreme Court sentenced president Manuel
 Bustos and vice president Arturo Martinez of the Unified
 Workers' Central (CUT) to 541 days' internal exile. The
 action stemmed from a petition by the Ministry of Interior to
 overturn an appeals court verdict exonerating the two from
 
 
 489
 CHILE
 charges relating to the deaths of persons in the wake of a
 general strike.
 With regard to forced or compulsory labor, see Section 6.c.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The right to a fair trial remains limited by Transitory
 Article 24. First instance jurisdiction for the prosecution
 of proscribed political activities remains with the regular
 civilian courts, but broad interpretation of state security
 laws has greatly expanded military court jurisdiction. As in
 most civil law systems, trial is not by jury, reliance is on
 the written record rather than oral testimony, and the judge
 renders his verdict after directing the investigation. The
 investigation phase is considered secret, with limited access
 to evidence or testimony which has been developed by the
 judge. Secrecy makes it extremely difficult to ascertain if
 justice is being done. There is a well-developed, multistage
 appeal process leading ultimately to the Supreme Court.
 Weapons violations (often the basis of charges against
 suspected terrorists) and charges of "offenses against-the
 Armed Forces," including slandering the Commander-in-Chief of
 the Army (President Pinochet), are tried before a military
 court. Appeals may be made to a military court consisting of
 two civilian judges and three military judges and, in the last
 resort, to the Supreme Court.
 Investigation by the courts of present and past human rights
 violations made little progress during 1988. Human rights
 organizations continued'to report that judges failed to
 investigate vigorously charges of government abuses of human
 rights. In May the Supreme Court charged a military prosecutor
 with serious and grave delays in the four cases of illegal
 arrest and brutality under his direction and ordered the
 military courts of the Army, Air Force, and Carabineros to
 adopt appropriate means to oversee timely processing of cases
 by military prosecutors. There has been no progress in the
 investigation by a military tribunal into the deaths of 12
 members of the FPMR in June 1987.
 The investigation by a military judge into the July 1986
 burning of Rodrigo Rojas (who died) and Carmen Gloria Quintana
 (who was severely injured) during an antigovernment protest
 was concluded on December 25, with the judge recommending a
 commuted sentence of 541 days in jail for the commander of the
 military patrol involved. The sentence must be confirmed by
 the military court, and both sides may appeal the judgment.
 The Social Aid Foundation of the Christian Churches (FASIC)
 reported that, as of September 30, there were 433 persons in
 prison and 597 persons facing judicial proceedings related to
 state security laws. Forty-five of these people have been in
 prison since before 1983, but the majority (197) were detained
 in 1986 and 1987. Ninety-five were detained in the first 9
 months of 1988. Of the 597 judicial proceedings, 477 are
 before military courts. Another 108 persons were released on
 bail during 1988, and 6 were released after completing their
 prison terms. Of a total prison population of 433 involved in
 violations of state security laws, 71 have been convicted and
 are serving their sentences, while 362 remain in detention
 with their cases still under investigation. In at least one
 case, the investigation phase has lasted 7 years.
 
 
 490
 CHILE
 International attention continued to focus during 1988 on nine
 prisoners who face possible death sentences because of charges
 of involvement in assassinations of senior military officers,
 bank robberies, and killings of Carabineros. Defense lawyers
 charged that all were tortured, and their-confessions obtained
 under physical and psychological duress. Human rights
 organizations have assisted 12 prisoners, including the 9
 facing a possible death sentence, to obtain visas to other
 countries. This was done in the belief that possession of
 such visas might either allow these prisoners to seek remission
 of their prison terms for exile or protect them from the death
 sentence. While the Government permitted many Chileans serving
 prison sentences related to politically motivated acts to seek
 exile in the mid-1970's, this practice has been severely
 restricted in recent years. One reason given has been that
 some of those who sought exile later returned to Chile
 illegally and became involved in terrorist activities. In
 August a petition by the military prosecutor for the death
 penalty for three persons found guilty of killing an army
 general in 1983 was denied. The penalty can only be imposed
 by unanimous decision of a military court and one judge voted
 against the death penalty. The military prosecutor appealed
 the decision to the Supreme Court in September on the grounds
 that the dissenting judge applied personal, not judicial,
 criteria to the case.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Searches of the home and interception of private
 communications are permitted by the Constitution, provided
 search warrants are issued by either a civilian or military
 court for specific locations. The 1984 antiterrorist law
 provides for surveillance of those promoting political views
 contrary to the Constitution or those suspected of terrorist
 crimes, and for intercepting, opening, or recording private
 communications and documents in these cases. The requirement
 to obtain proper court documents for searches and surveillance,
 however, was not always complied with during the year. A
 significant number of searches were carried out by security
 forces or by armed groups who failed or refused to show
 identification, or without the necessary court orders. Many
 searches were conducted in the early hours of the morning,
 often with force and violence. However, the Vicariate of
 Solidarity noted that during 1988 there were no reported
 instances of security forces closing off an entire
 neighborhood in order to conduct searches as had been done in
 the past.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution recognizes freedom of speech and press, but
 these freedoms are severely restricted. Article 8 provides
 for sanctions against "persons or groups propagating doctrines
 undermining the family, espousing violence or a concept of the
 society, the state, or legal order of a totalitarian character
 or contrary to the institutional order of the country...."
 Violations of this Article may include media coverage,
 commentary, or publicity about such groups or doctrines. The
 military code provides for sanctions against persons charged
 with "offenses against the Armed Forces." Critical
 editorials, satirical reports, and articles on issues deemed
 sensitive by the Armed Forces have been cited under this
 
 
 491
 CHILE
 provision. Laws also exist specifically dealing with security
 violations and terrorism. On December 30, the Government
 dropped charges against the six journalists named in the two
 media cased before civil courts. Earlier in the year, several
 civil and military court cases were dismissed or terminated.
 However, at year's end military court cases on charges for
 "offenses against the armed forces" continued against
 approximatey 26 Chilean citizens, including 18 journalists,
 involved in publishing, or writing for publication, news
 stories or commentaries. In 1988 new charges were brought in
 military courts against 17 persons, 6 of whom faced earlier
 charges. All of those with charges remaining were connected
 with five publications: the opposition weekly magazines
 Analisis, Apsi, and Cauce, the daily newspaper Fortin Diario,
 and the Jesuit monthly Mensaje. Analisis magazine editor Juan
 Pablo Cardenas served 541 days of nightly imprisonment for
 "offenses against the President of the Republic" in editorials
 published in 1986. Cardenas also is cited in four additional
 cases, two of them filed in 1988, before the military courts.
 Apsi editor Marcelo Contreras is named in two cases before a
 military court. Cauce editor Francisco Javier Herreros also
 is named in five cases, all before military courts. Fortin
 Diario editor Alberto Gamboa faces two charges, one for
 publishing a book on his experiences
 in a concentration camp following the 1973 coup. Cases are
 also pending against personnel of the weekly magazine Hoy, the
 daily newspaper La Epoca, and other publications. One civil
 court case, against the daily newspaper La Prensa Austral of
 Punta Arenas for publishing a story about exiles, was
 dismissed.
 The media continue to be the target of political violence and
 threats, including extralegal pressure from extremist groups.
 Radio stations in the smaller towns have been subject to
 harassment, through means ranging from strict and selective
 application of technical regulations to anonymous threats
 against advertisers.' One station, in the northern town of
 Iquique, was forced off the air for 7 months for alleged
 technical violations. After receiving permission to resume
 broadcasting, the station's transmission tower fell over,
 reportedly because the mounting bolts had been removed.
 Advertisers on a station in the south received threatening
 letters, and the business premises of one advertiser were
 bombed. In February police deactivated a bomb found in the
 offices of the conservative newspaper El Mercurio of
 Valparaiso, but in March a bomb exploded in the newspaper's
 offices. In May a firebomb was thrown into El Mercurio
 offices in the town of La Calera. In April a photographer of
 the opposition daily Fortin Mapocho was beaten, and in August
 the offices of the publication were stoned. In September
 leftwing extremists assaulted a radio station in order to
 broadcast propaganda. On the nights of October 6 and 7,
 groups of journalists, most of them foreign, were attacked by
 a Carabinero special forces unit in downtown Santiago
 following the breakup of victory celebrations by opponents of
 the Government. The journalists charged that some 20 to 25 of
 them were deliberately pursued and clubbed by the police.
 With the lifting of the states of exception on August 24, it
 is no longer necessary to obtain government permission to
 begin publishing a newspaper or magazine. The Government
 continues to exercise control over the media through legal
 actions, economic pressures (several major media enterprises
 are seriously in debt to government financial institutions),
 and pressure on personnel and editorial decisions. However,
 
 
 492
 CHILE
 the level of censorship decreased in the period leading up to
 the October plebiscite, and this improvement continued through
 the last months of 1988.
 The Government itself directly operates the country's largest
 television network. The other television stations are
 monitored, and program planning remains strongly influenced by
 self-censorship. In 1988, however, there was a gradual change
 in the practice of giving coverage only to the government
 viewpoint, which had been the case for many years- By the end
 of the year, all channels were giving substantial coverage to
 a wide range of political viewpoints. In January Channel 11,
 operated by the University of Chile, became the first to offer
 a regularly scheduled.public affairs discussion program which
 included political leaders critical of the Government. In
 March Catholic University Television began a series of weekly
 panel shows which included personalities from a wide range of
 the political spectrum. As the plebiscite approached, the
 news coverage given to opposition leaders by the nongovernment
 channels increased, although the overall time given to
 government views remained vastly greater. From September 5 to
 October 1, all television stations carried, by law, a
 30-minute block of free political advertising each day,
 divided equally between supporters of the Government and the
 opposition. This block immediately received high vierer
 ratings, and many Chilean commentators believe this television
 access by the opposition was a significant factor in its
 plebiscite victory on October 5. Although pclitical
 advertising ended on October 1, coverage of opposition
 political leaders by the nongovernment media in the
 postplebiscite period remained relatively frequent; during the
 last months of 1988, government-owned national television and
 radio systems began to give substantial news coverage to a
 variety of political events and views.
 The Government announced that a new radio and television law
 designed, among other things, to "privatize" television, is
 being prepared for submission to the military junta, but its
 provisions remain unknown.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Restrictions on peaceful demonstrations and association,
 already reduced in 1987 with the legalization of political
 parties, were further relaxed in August with the lifting of
 the states of exception. Although official permission to hold
 rallies was no longer technically required, authorities had to
 be notified in writing of planned public events; on several
 occasions, police authorities cited public safety concerns as
 justification for changing the venue of opposition rallies to
 more distant locales. There were credible reports that
 Carabinero forces were quicker to employ tear gas and water
 cannon to disperse rowdy elements of opposition rallies than
 of progovernment rallies. Those who held demonstrations or
 protests without notifying officials in writing and in advance
 were subject to arrest and prosecution.
 On August 29, a group of protesters, most of them women,
 conducted a peaceful march while holding cutouts of human
 figures painted with the names of victims of human rights abuse
 and the question, "Have you forgotten me?" The group was
 dispersed with water cannon and tear gas. On September 22, a
 progovernment demonstration held without prior notice at the
 presidential palace was also dispersed with tear gas. Similar
 excessive force was employed on September 15 against those,

 CHILE
 many of them foreign members of the International Confederation
 of Free Trade Unions, accompanying labor leaders Manuel Bustos
 and Arturo Martinez when they surrendered to the court to
 begin their internal exile.
 On October 23 the United Left (a nonregistered party made up
 primarily of Socialists and Communists) held a rally; Clodomiro
 Almeyda, head of one of the Socialist Party factions who had
 been released from jail a few days before, was one of the
 principal speakers, despite a court order denying him the right
 to speak in public. Organizers of the rally subsequently
 claimed that police injured two demonstrators. Subsequent
 public meetings by the United Left were held without reports
 of incidents.
 For a discussion of freedom of association as it applies to
 labor unions, see Section 6.a.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 The Constitution provides for freedom of religion. Although
 Chile is predominantly Roman Catholic, there are no
 restrictions on religious practices and no official
 discrimination against any religious group. A number of
 Protestant denominations and other groups are active and
 report full freedom and tolerance, as does the local Jewish
 community. Religious belief and adherence appear to have no
 effect on acceptability for government positions. The Mormon
 Church continued to be a target of leftwing terrorist groups.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Chileans are promised full constitutional freedom to move
 -within and to enter and leave their country. However, as
 noted, two Chilean labor leaders were sentenced to internal
 exile in August. About 350 Chileans were denied the right to
 return to Chile until September 1, when orders for their exile
 were lifted by President Pinochet. International organizations
 dealing with political refugees believe that the number who
 returned to Chile in 1988 was approximately 650, a number far
 exceeded by those who left for political reasons. Many exiles
 presumably choose to remain in their adopted countries for
 economic and family reasons. Some human rights groups assert
 that former exiles associated with the political left face
 excessive scrutiny of any degrees or licenses they may have
 earned abroad.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 In keeping with the terms of the 1980 Constitution, on
 August 30, the Commanders-in-Chief of the Armed Forces and
 national police selected a single candidate for a plebiscite
 which was held October 5. That candidate; President Pinochet,
 was defeated; he will continue as President until March 11,
 1990. Before that date, competitive elections for a president
 and the Congress must be held; they have been scheduled for
 December 1989.
 Foreign and Chilean observers of the plebiscite unanimously
 agreed that it was conducted in a free and fair way, and
 praised the election procedures for safeguarding privacy and
 accountability. The Chilean Armed Forces and Carabineros were
 also praised for their exemplary conduct on election day.

 Women are active in Chilean political life and have served in
 such important government positions as mayors, agency heads,
 and ministers, although none is currently in the cabinet.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 During 1988 the Government continued to cooperate.with the
 UNHRC Special Rapporteur and provided another detailed reply
 to the Special Rapporteur's report on the human rights
 situation in Chile. The Special Rapporteur visited Chile in
 October, during the plebiscite.
 The Government also continued its cooperation with the ICRC,
 which provided confidential reports to key government
 ministries on the results of its visits to prisons, as
 provided for in the agreements signed late in 1986 and early
 in 1987 with the CNI, the Investigations Police, and the
 Carabineros.
 The Government permits visits and investigations by private
 international human rights groups, but a number of visitors as
 well as diplomatic personnel assigned to Chile were denied
 permission to visit specific prisoners even after seeking
 permission in writing. In past years such permission had been
 given more readily. The Government made no effort to impede
 the many international observers of the plebiscite and
 vote-counting on October 5.
 The Catholic Church continues to take the lead in defending
 human rights. It supplies legal counsel to those accused of
 politically related crimes and to victims of human rights
 abuses. Its Vicariate of Solidarity monitors the human rights
 situation throughout Chile, issues factual monthly reports,
 and protects and defends significant numbers of people. The
 statistics provided by the Vicariate generally cover cases
 actually handled by it. The Chilean Commission for Human
 Rights (CHRC), a private organization directed by opposition
 political figures, also continued to publicize abuses.
 Statistics provided by the CHRC cover violations brought to
 their attention throughout the country. Since some persons
 involved in human rights violations may not go to the
 Vicariate for assistance, the CHRC statistics provide a wider
 but less first-hand picture of human rights violations.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Minority groups do not suffer from any specific legal
 discrimination. The only significant racial minority, the
 Mapuche Indians in southern Chile, remains separated from the
 rest of society because of historical, cultural, educational,
 and geographical factors rather than official policy. Some
 Mapuche leaders charge that government policies throughout the
 years have failed to take into account the different cultural
 values of the Mapuche, particularly in the areas of land
 ownership and education. They have continued in some instances
 to refuse to participate in government attempts to assign land
 to individual families, preferring to retain the land as tribal
 property.
 Legal distinctions between the sexes still exist. The legal
 retirement age for women is 5 years lower than that for men.
 Married women may not conduct major commercial transactions
 
 
 495
 CHILE
 unless a separation of goods contract is established at the
 time of marriage, or through a subsequent special one-time
 authorization. Inheritance laws provide strong protection for
 wives and favor female over male heirs. Proposed legislation
 to modify portions of the laws relating to women is under
 consideration but no action was taken by year's end. The
 changes would affect such matters as allowing women to take
 children out of the country without the father's permission
 and relaxing restrictions on women engaging in business
 transactions.
 Average salaries paid to women for similar work are lower than
 those paid to men. In 1983 females made up 48.8 percent of
 the primary school enrollment, 50.5 percent of secondary school
 pupils, and 40 percent of university students. Women enjoy
 good access to low-level and midlevel professional jobs but do
 not hold a proportional number of high-level positions.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Most aspects of labor rights are codified in 12 laws passed in
 1987. The law regarding political parties discriminates
 against trade union (and professional association) leaders,
 prohibiting them from being officers of political parties.
 Legal challenges to this provision were rejected in 1987.
 Officials of those union organizations which lack legal
 standing continue to be active in political parties.
 Legally recognized unions do not need permission to hold union
 meetings or conferences. Under the law, unions cannot elect
 as an officer a person who is. under indictment. The labor
 code also prohibits the development of national union
 confederations. Labor unions can and do maintain relations
 with international labor bodies in their fields. The
 Government selects Chilean worker delegates participating in
 the conference of the International Labor Organization (ILO),
 and in 1988, as in the past, the Government sought to avoid
 challenges to the credentials of these delegates by consulting
 with representative trade unions in Chile. However, in
 selecting delegates to represent the Chilean workers in the
 ILO, the Government ignores the major de facto umbrella labor
 organizations, such as the National Workers' Command (CNT),
 which the Government does not recognize. The Government's
 refusal to select delegates for the ILO from these de facto
 umbrella organizations has been the major issue in the
 challenges to credentials in the ILO. These challenges have
 not had sufficient support in the ILO to be successful.
 Under the labor code there are severe restrictions on the
 right to strike. Strikes are prohibited in designated
 strategic enterprises, primarily public utilities, the largest
 government copper mine, and the petroleum industry. In 1988
 the Government confirmed the 1987 designation of 25
 enterprises as strategic. There is no indication that
 blacklisting of trade union leaders and members who
 participated in illegal strike actions in past years has
 ended; however, there was no instance of massive dismissal of
 workers for striking in 1988.
 Harassment of trade union leaders continued. On January 26,
 leaders of the-National Workers' Command, which was
 subsequently subsumed into the Unified Workers' Central (CUT),
 were sentenced to 541 days' imprisonment for calling a general
 
 
 496
 CHILE
 strike on October 7, 1987, in the aftermath of which several
 people died. In handing down the sentence, the judge recalled
 previous arrests of the union leaders, Manuel Bustos and Arturo
 Martinez, for activities "characterized by their violence,
 sowing of hatred, stench of resentment, series of vulgarities
 and dangerous demonstrations." An appeals court overturned
 the conviction. Subsequently, the Minister of Interior
 appealed to the Supreme Court to restore the original sentence;
 on August 17 the high court imposed a sentence of_541 days of
 internal exile, a sentence rarely handed down by Chilean
 courts. Bustos and Martinez are currently the only persons
 subject to this type of punishment. They are confined to
 small towns in the interior of Chile.
 Organized labor continued to press for a full investigation of
 the 1982 murder of labor leader Tucapel Jimenez. Efforts to
 have the Government appoint another judge to investigate this
 murder were not successful, and the case remains officially
 closed. While the Government dropped indictments against a
 political leader and a trade union officer for having slandered
 the Government in this case, interest remains high within
 Chilean and international trade union circles that this case
 be reopened.
 For a number of years, complaints have been filed in the ILO
 against the Government, alleging repressive measures against
 -demonstrations; arrest and ill-treatment of union leaders;
 violent suppression of May Day demonstrations; and dismissal
 of strike leaders. In 1988 additional allegations were filed,
 to which the Government provided an extensive response. On
 December 24, 1987, after failing to make promised changes in
 its labor code to enhance workers' rights, Chile was formally
 suspended from the list of countries eligible to participate
 in the U.S. Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) program,
 and it remained off the list in 1988.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 Workers in Chile have the right to form and join unions.
 While the rules governing union organizing in firms employing
 between 25 and 50 workers were eased in 1988, there are
 generally severe restrictions on collective bargaining.
 Collective bargaining is strictly regulated, and the entire
 collective bargaining procedure can be nullified if one
 legally constituted deadline is missed by either the union or
 management. Further, any decision by a union to delay the
 bargaining process in anticipation of a more propitious future
 bargaining atmosphere automatically extends the current
 contract for a minimum 2-year period.
 There are no export processing zones or other special districts
 where different laws apply.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Forced or compulsory labor is implicitly prohibited in Chile's
 Constitution and labor code, and there have been no complaints
 on this issue since the mid-1970's.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 Child labor is regulated by law. Young people between the
 ages of 14 and 15 may be employed only with the permission of
 their parents or guardians and if they have completed their
 schooling, and then only in restricted types of labor. Those
 
 
 497
 CHILE
 between the ages of 15 and 18 can be employed in a larger
 variety of labor and at expanded hours, but only with their
 parents' or guardians' permission. Economic factors have
 forced many children to seek part-time and full-time
 employment in areas of the economy which are generally
 difficult to regulate.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 Minimum wages, hours of work, and occupational safety and
 health standards are regulated by law. The law permits the
 hiring of apprentices, but pay may not be less than the
 minimum wage. Laws covering wages and hours of work are
 difficult to enforce, and there are complaints that
 occupational health and safety laws are not adequately
 enforced. Workers have the right to denounce employees who
 pay less than the minimum wage, and employers can be forced to
 pay back wages, but an employee who brings such a complaint
 risks losing his job for having done so.
 The normal workweek is 48 hours long. The minimum wage is
 approximately $50 per month. It is not considered sufficient
 for a decent standard of living, but many households have two
 full-time income earners.
