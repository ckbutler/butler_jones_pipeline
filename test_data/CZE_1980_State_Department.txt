 CZECHOSLOVAKIA
 The Czechoslovak Socialist Republic is governed by a
 Communist regime similar to those in other Warsaw Pact
 states. It has an advanced economy and a sophisticated
 and well-educated populace which has had long contact with
 the main currents of Western European thought and tradi-
 tion. The two main ethnic groups -- the Czechs and the
 Slovaks -- have had different historical experiences and
 developments. The accommodation of the interests and
 aspirations of both groups within one country has not
 always been a smooth process. Slovak resentment at the
 longstanding domination of the central government by the
 more numerous Czechs led to the adoption in 1968 of the
 present federal system in which some functions are dele-
 gated to separate Czech and Slovak governments, and in
 which Slovaks are more heavily represented than previously
 in federal institutions.
 Although both the Czechs and the Slovaks were long under
 the domination of others, they had a successful experience
 with democracy from the founding of the modern Czecho-
 slovak state in 1918 until its destruction by Hitler in
 1938. with the imposition of Communist rule in 1948, the
 people of Czechoslovakia have again been subjected to an
 authoritarian system of government. The "Prague Spring"
 of 1968, the brief experiment at liberalization which
 attempted to bring "socialism with a human face" to
 Czechoslovakia, demonstrated that the desire for partici-
 patory democracy still existed among the people and even
 within the Communist Party. The August 1968 invasion by
 the Soviet Union and four other members of the Warsaw Pact
 and the permanent stationing of an estimated 70,000 Soviet
 troops within the country demonstrated even more force-
 fully, however, that the Soviet Union was unwilling to
 tolerate a participatory democracy in Czechoslovakia.
 Czechoslovak citizens are restricted in their practice of
 basic civil and political freedoms. Overt opposition to
 the laws and guidelines approved by the Communist Party in
 any field, including creative activity, is punished. The
 threat of punishment and the denial of economic or educa-
 tional opportunity, however, are much more widely used
 methods of control than punishment by arrest and imprison-
 ment. Within the strictures of Party and government poli-
 cies, the Czechoslovak people do not actively participate
 in political and economic decision-making. Attempts to
 enlarge the area of popular debate on Czechoslovak govern-
 ment policies in recent years have been countered.
 Charter 77 is a movement of intellectuals, students and
 some workers which has been seeking to persuade the
 Czechoslovak government to abide by its own laws and
 international commitments. The government has attempted
 to suppress dissident activity by periodically arresting,
 trying, and sentencing leading members of the movement to
 prison terms on charges of anti-state activities. Many
 people active in Charter 77 have emigrated in the face of
 harassment by the authorities. Some Czechoslovak citi-
 zens, such as author Pavel Kohout, have been denied per-
 mission to return to the country after temporary stays
 abroad and have been stripped of their citizenship.

 Others, most recently journalist Jiri Lederer, have emi-
 grated after serving prison terms for political offenses.
 The police frequently detain human rights activists for 48
 hours before releasing them with warnings. This occurred,
 for example, in September 1980 when about thirty people
 were detained and questioned about their support for stri-
 kers in Poland. Occasionally, trials are held and prison
 sentences are imposed for terms ranging from one to five
 years or more for such crimes as subversion, incitement
 and parasitism. One example of this was the October 1979
 trial of six members of the Committee for the Defense of
 the Unjustly Persecuted (a group which publicizes abuses
 of the judicial system) which resulted in five prison sen-
 tences on charges of subversion. One of the five, Otta
 Bednarova, was released early in September 1980 because of
 severe health problems.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 The integrity of the person is guaranteed in Article 30 of
 the constitution which states, "inviolability of the per-
 son shall be guaranteed. . . . Offenders can be punished
 only by due process of law." There is no indication that
 torture is used by the Czechoslovak government.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 Despite the provisions of Article 30, there are reports
 that the police employ harsh methods, such as beatings, in
 interrogations of suspected criminals. This is especially
 true in political cases, and beatings have been reported
 in police stations as well as on the street under circum-
 stances which led the victims to believe that the actions
 were performed by police officials. There have been no
 reports of perpetrators of such actions being arrested and
 tried. The government has compelled political dissidents
 to be examined and treated at psychiatric institutions in
 order to discredit them. Prison conditions are sub-
 standard -- for example, cells are small and unheated.
 Prisoners report that they receive administrative punish-
 ments, such as reductions in pay and limitations on free
 time and bathing and exercise periods, for failing to meet
 unrealistically high work standards. The diet in prisons
 is reliably reported to be deficient, sometimes requiring
 persons to undergo special medical treatment upon
 release. Amnesty International has reported inadequate
 medical care in the cases of several political prisoners.
 There are three categories of imprisonment, with corres-
 pondingly harsher regimes of incarceration for more
 serious crimes and recidivists. Visits to all prisoners
 by family members are limited, and the frequency with
 which visits are allowed varies according to the category
 of imprisonment. Political prisoners sometimes report
 that they are subjected to harsher treatment, not only by
 guards but by fellow inmates. There are no reports that
 different treatment is otherwise afforded according to
 social class, race, sex or religion. In practice, effec-
 tive redress for cruel and degrading treatment does not
 appear possible. There are no summary executions. The
 
 
 762
 death penalty is imposed for particularly heinous crimes,
 but only after judicial review and consideration of execu-
 tive clemency.
 c. Disappearances
 No instances of disappearance have been reported in
 Czechoslovakia.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 The number of political prisoners in Czechoslovakia is
 estimated at approximately 100. This figure is imprecise
 at best, however, since the government does not recognize
 prisoners of conscience as a special category. Political
 defendants have been tried and convicted on the basis of
 sweeping charges, such as "damaging the interests of the
 Republic." Detained persons can be held up to 48 hours
 without charges. The two-month limit on pre-trial deten-
 tion can be extended by the prosecutor at will. There are
 no effective safeguards, such as habeas corpus, for defen-
 dants.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Czechoslovak law required that all trials be public and
 that the accused be given the right to counsel, informed
 of the charges and entitled to present a defense. In
 practice, however, there are significant restrictions on
 these legal guarantees for those charged with political
 crimes. Public access to trials of persons charged with
 political offenses is denied; only selected supporters of
 the regime and a limited number of relatives are admitted
 to the courtroom. Although counsel may visit the accused,
 both before and after the trial, a police officer is often
 present to monitor the meetings. Lawyers have been known
 to have been disbarred after too vigorous a defense of
 political opponents of the government. Defendants do
 exercise the right to defend themselves in court and
 occasionally have charges dismissed or downgraded at the
 original trial or on appeal.
 The courts have only limited independence. Judges can be
 removed by either the Federal Assembly or by the National
 Councils of the Czech or Slovak republics. Civilians are
 tried by military courts only in special circumstances,
 including cases of espionage. All verdicts and sentences
 can be appealed to at least one higher court by either the
 defendant or the prosecutor or both.
 f. invasion of the Home
 The constitution guarantees the inviolability of the
 home. A search warrant is required from the prosecutor
 unless there is not time to obtain one. There are wide-
 spread reports of house searches without warrants, how-
 ever. Evidence obtained in these searches is, in prac-
 tice, admissible in court. The homes of dissidents are
 often closely watched by the police in order to curtail
 access by Western newsmen or other dissidents. It is
 believed that "bugging" is widespread, particularly of
 residences of persons who are politically suspect.
 
 
 2. Government Policies Relating to the Fulfillment of Such
 Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care and Education
 In 'Czechslovakia the basic needs of food, shelter, health
 care and primary education are met. The stable, largely
 urbanized population enjoys a reasonably comfortable
 material existence. The average monthly income is about
 $290, inflation is estimated to be about 10 percent, and
 economic growth has taken place at an annual rate of
 approximately 3.7 percent over the past five years. The
 life expectancy for Czechoslovak women is 74 years and for
 men, 67 years. There are deficiencies of supplies and
 difficulties in distribution, but these are attributable
 more to economic constraints or management deficiencies
 than to deliberate neglect of human needs. There is also
 a pension system which provides a minimum income; in addi-
 tion, some retirees are allowed to supplement their per-
 manent income by working. There are reports that items
 and services in scarce supply, such as some foodstuffs,
 certain items of clothing, apartments in desirable loca-
 tions and medical care, can be obtained through payment of
 bribes or by other corrupt practices.
 Education is compulsory to 15 years of age. Literacy is
 near universal. Secondary and university education are
 free of charge, but there are many reports that the selec-
 tion of students for courses and schools leading to more
 desirable careers is based on their parents' political
 standing. Access to higher education thus appears to be
 an instrument of control over a large segment of the popu-
 lation. Carrying on a private business is a criminal
 offense, and virtually all economic activity is carried
 out by state-owned corporations or cooperatives. Private
 ownership of residences is permitted under strict controls
 of size and number. Second, or vacation homes, are
 permitted and many people own one.
 Czechoslovakia has had a rising standard of living since
 the end of World War II, but recent figures show a
 tapering off. Czechoslovak society was relatively egali-
 tarian during the 1918-1938 Republic; the result of more
 than 30 years of Communist rule has been a comprehensive
 economic leveling of the population, with neither great
 wealth nor poverty. Nonetheless, there are significant
 variances in living standards, with elites among Communist
 Party members, artists and athletes having standards far
 above the norm, and other groups, particularly some pen-
 sioners, with incomes at or below subsistence levels.
 Conditions in work places generally meet basic safety
 standards, but there are reports of shortages of indus-
 trial protective equipment. Industrial pollution is
 causing health problems in certain areas.
 About 48 percent of Czechoslovak women are in the work
 force. Most of them have lower paying, less skilled
 jobs. Equal pay for equal work is practiced in almost all
 cases. There are inconsistencies in the responsibilities
 women are asked to assume, however. They are encouraged
 to join the work force, but are also offered incentives to
 have children. Women are generally expected to do all the
 housework and child care in addition to their full-time
 employment outside the home.

 3. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 Freedom of speech and press are guaranteed in the consti-
 tution provided the exercise of these freedoms is ". . .
 consistent with the interests of the working people. ..
 Freedom of assembly is also allowed in order for citizens
 ".. . to take an active part in the administration of the
 state and in the economic and cultural development of the
 country."
 In practice, however, these freedoms do not exist. Indi-
 viduals may not publicly express views contrary to the
 "principles of a socialist state," criticize the Czecho-
 slovak Communist Party or the government's decisions and
 leaders, or hold public meetings without permission from
 the police. The mass media are completely controlled by
 the state and operate under the direct supervision of the
 Party. Many prominent journalists who supported liberali-
 zation in 1968 are not allowed to practice their profes-
 sion. A small group of writers is reportedly attempting
 to achieve some relaxation of censorship. Only a few
 western periodicals are allowed into the country, and
 those are unobtainable by ordinary people.
 Radio Free Europe is jammed, but most other international
 broadcasting, including Voice of America, is received in
 Czechoslovakia. Freedom of association is closely con-
 trolled in.practice. All professional groups are com-
 pletely controlled by the State. No independent groups
 are allowed to exist. Printing and reproduction devices,
 other than typewriters, are controlled by the Ministry of
 the Interior and it is illegal for an individual to
 possess one. Reproduction of printed materials is limited
 to eleven typewritten copies, and reproduction of "subver-
 sive" materials is a criminal offense.
 Freedom of religious belief and freedom to practice reli-
 gion are guaranteed in the constitution. In practice,
 however, the State rigorously regulates religious
 activity. Clergy are paid by the State and require a
 State license in order to practice. Their activities and
 public statements, including sermons and homilies, are
 closely watched by government authorities. Religious edu-
 cation, proselytizing, and the education of new clergy are
 carefully limited, and only those religious groups recog-
 nized by the State are permitted to operate. Male reli-
 gious orders are not permitted in Czechoslovakia and mem-
 bers of female orders are restricted to nursing and the
 care of the elderly in outlying areas. The Jehovah's Wit-
 nesses are explicitly outlawed. Overt religious activity
 usually results in effective disqualification for advance-
 ment in most fields.
 Nominally, about 11 million Czechoslovaks are Catholics
 and just over one million are Protestants. Some priests
 and much of the senior Catholic clergy have been co-opted
 into a pro-government organization, Pacem in Terris. As
 demonstrated by the arrests of several Catholic priests
 and lay workers in the fall of 1979 for distributing
 samizdat (self-published) religious literature, those who
 
 
 765
 stray beyond the narrowly defined boundaries of the per-
 missible are subject to punishment.
 The Jewish community, numbering several thousand, has a
 central religious organization financially supported by
 the government. There are synagogues and prayer houses
 and a Jewish museum. There are no Jewish schools or
 rabbinical seminaries, but one Czech Jew is attending a
 rabbinical seminary abroad.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration and Repatriation
 Freedom of movement within Czechoslovakia is not normally
 restricted. Travel in some areas near the borders or in
 the vicinity of military installations is proscribed.
 Travel by Czechs and Slovaks to other Eastern European
 Communist countries (except Yugoslavia and the Soviet
 Union) is unhindered, but travel to Western countries is
 difficult since travelers must obtain permission and,
 unless visiting close relatives, a hard currency authori-
 zation. Travelers to the West usually must leave some
 member of the immediate family at home to ensure their
 return. These restrictions are relaxed for retirees.
 Obtaining permission to emigrate is a long and arduous
 process, especially for persons in political opposition to
 the government. Applicants must endure long waits and may
 occasionally suffer reprisals such as demotion or loss of
 job after applying. There are no special barriers to any-
 one emigrating to join a foreign spouse. Czechoslovakia
 denies the right of repatriation by the expedient of
 depriving of citizenship those of its citizens it does not
 wish to return. Such denial is generally utilized only in
 political cases involving prominent dissidents. Emigra-
 tion passports are not valid for return to Czechoslovakia
 without special endorsement; voluntary expatriation is
 frequently a condition for permission to emigrate, parti-
 cularly in cases where the emigrant does not have close
 relatives abroad.
 The only significant refugee group within the country is
 Communists who have fled from non-Communist countries.
 The largest group in this category is Greek Communists,
 but others, including Indonesians and Americans, are known
 to reside in Czechoslovakia. There are no known instances
 of forced repatriations from this group. There is a
 significant outflow of refugees'from Czechoslovakia, pri-
 marily persons who leave the country legally on vacation
 to non-Warsaw Pact European countries, and do not return.
 This probably amounts to several thousand people annually,
 but precise statistics are unavailable.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 All significant decisions regarding the government, the
 economy, and society are made exclusively by the leader-
 ship of the Communist Party. Meaningful participation in
 the political process is enjoyed only by members of the
 Party and within the Party only by a very limited number
 of leaders. Ordinary citizens, especially those who are
 not Party members, have no role in the process of selec-
 ting their leaders or in making important political or
 
 
 economic decisions. Four minor political parties are per-
 mitted to organize and to publish their own newspapers,
 but must conform their activities to the line of the
 ruling Communist party.
 There is little evidence of meaningful public discussion
 of social, political, or economic issues. In general, the
 people only learn about final decisions of the Party and
 the government. The government has reacted to attempts to
 broaden the political process by arrest and imprisonment.
 Women are equal under the law. There are small numbers of
 women in the professions and in higher-ranking Party,
 government and management positions.
 The trade union movement is organized under the guidance
 of the Communist Party, as provided for in the constitu-
 tion. Worker membership is virtually obligatory.
 Strikes, collective bargaining and lobbying are not per-
 mitted. Workers are expected to carry out directives to
 fulfill the economic plan and have little influence over
 production. In some cases, workers have been able to
 bring about changes in their working conditions. The
 right and duty to work are guaranteed in the constitu-
 tion. In practice, persons who hold political views
 differing from the government have found it difficult to
 retain the positions for which they were trained and have
 been forced into menial jobs such as window-washers,
 stokers, and street cleaners. The International Labor
 Organization has faulted the Czechoslovak government for
 this practice. The threat of economic deprivation is used
 as a method of political control.
 About 600,000 Hungarians live in Czechoslovakia, primarily
 in Slovakia along the border with Hungary. Primary edu-
 cation in Hungarian is provided in these areas as well as
 Hungarian language radio and television programs, news-
 papers, and magazines. Hungarians are proportionately
 represented in federal and local legislative bodies, but
 are under-represented in prestigious jobs in the economy
 and the state apparatus. The only other sizeable minority
 group in Czechoslovakia is Gypsies, numbering about
 250,000 persons, who are generally viewed by Czechs and
 Slovaks as occupying a lower social stratum.
 4. Government Attitude and Record Regarding International
 and Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged
 Violations of Human Rights
 Czechoslovakia has signed the Final Act of the Conference
 on Security and Cooperation in Europe. The Czechoslovak
 government has reacted strongly to expressions of concern
 about human rights violations in Czechoslovakia by other
 governments or non-governmental institutions. It fre-
 quently delays or refuses visas to members of interna-
 tional human rights organizations. In several instances
 representatives from these organizations have been
 detained or expelled during visits to Czechoslovakia. The
 government's stated reason for reacting with such high
 sensitivity to outside investigation is that it considers
 these matters to be internal issues.
 There are two groups within Czechoslovakia that concern
 themselves with human rights. One is Charter 77; the
 
 
 767
 other the Committee for the Defense of the Unjustly Perse-
 cuted (VONS). Charter 77 has issued several studies on
 topics such as the standard of living, the plight of pen-
 sioners, and the right to travel abroad. VONS concen-
 trates on abuses of the judicial system, and uses public
 records and reports from friends and relatives of the
 accused to issue communiques on cases where it believes
 the police, the courts or the prisons have abused citi-
 zens' civil or human rights. These communiques are
 distributed to Czechoslovak authorities.
 As a result of their activities, members of both these
 groups have suffered considerable persecution, including
 loss of jobs, detentions, loss of educational opportuni-
 ties for their children, imprisonment, and minor harass-
 ment such as suspension of driving licenses and surveil-
 lance.
