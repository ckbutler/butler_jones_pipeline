 GUINEA-BISSAU
 Joao Bernardo Vieira was elected President in the Republic of Guinea-Bissau's
 fi st multiparty'elections in 1994. Vieira has ruled the country since taking power
 in a 1980 coup. He is also a member of the African Party for the Independence of
 Guinea-Bissau and Cape Verde (PAIGC), which was the only legal political party
 from independence in 1974 until adoption of a multiparty constitution in 1991. The
 
 
 PAIGC holds 62 of the 100 seats in the National Assembly where 4 other parties
 are represented. The Constitution provides for an independent judiciary, but its
 functioning is hampered by a lack of resources and by corruption.
 The police, under the direction of the Ministry of the Interior, have primary re-
 sponsibility for the nation's internal security. The armed forces are responsible for
 external security and may be called upon to assist the police in internal emer-
 gencies. The police were responsible for human rights abuses.
 The population of 1 million relies largely upon subsistence agriculture and the ex-
 port of cashew nuts. Annual per capita gross domestic product is estimated at $840.
 The country underwent a major economic transformation in 1997 with its entrance
 to the West African Economic and Monetary Union (UEMOA). The introduction of
 the UEMOA's cfa franc has provided the country with its first convertible currency.
 In addition UEMOA provides a larger potential market for the country's products.
 In the short term, admission has caused some adjustment problems, including cur-
 rency shortages, but on the whole JEMOA membership is expected to be positive.
 The country remains burdened by a heavy external debt and has inadequate tax
 revenues.
 Political pluralism brought about greater transparency. However, the overall
 human rights situation did not improve during the year. Police continued to engae
 in arbitrary detention, physical mistreatment, and other forms of harassment. he
 Government did not punish any members of the security forces for abuses. Prison
 conditions remained poor, and prolonged detention and a lack of due process contin-
 ued. Journalists continue to practice self-censorship. Discrimination against women
 and female genital mutilation are problems.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political or
 other extrajudicial killings.
 The Interior Ministry claims to be continuing an internal investigation into the
 1996 shooting of two African deportees by police following demonstrations; one of
 the deportees died. The authorities have yet to release any results or punish anyone
 involved.
 The 1992 death of Ussumane Quade, an army officer beaten to death while in po-
 lice custody, remains unresolved. Early this year, two police officers were arrested
 in connection with his death; however, they were never charged and were later re-
 leased. The human rights monitors from the Guinean Human Rights League contin-
 ued to press for prosecution of the officers.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution prohibits cruel and inhuman punishment, and evidence obtained
 through torture or other coercion is invalid. However, the Government often ignores
 these prvisions. Security and police authorities have historically employed abusive
 interrogation methods, usually in the form of severe beatings or deprivation. The
 Government rarely enforces provisions for punishment of abuses committed by secu-
 rity forces. Beatings and deprivation have continued to be used in prisons as a
 means of coercion.The head of the national police has initiated a program to edu-
 cate police in the interior against using such methods. The program was conducted
 in three regions during 1996 and 1997. According to the police, a lack of resources
 prevents the program from being used elsewhere.
 Two policemen accused of rape in 1995 have yet to stand trial, and no trial date
 has been set. As s the case for most prisoners awaiting trial, the policemen are free
 during the day and jailed at night. Human rights monitors report other incidents
 in which police accused of rape or mistreatment of prisoners have not been pros-
 ecuted.
 Prison conditions are poor but generally are not life threatening. Prison authori-
 ties have very little control over inmates, many of whom simply leave during the
 day. The Interior Minister has requested international donor assistance to rehabili-
 tate the prisons.
 The Human Rights League was given access to the prisons during the year.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The legal system provides for procedural
 rights, such as the right to counsel, the right to release if no timely indictment is
 brought, and the right to a speedy trial. In practice the judicial system generally
 fails to provide these rights.
 Police detain suspects without judicial authority or warrants, occasionally through
 the devices of house arrest. The  verent holds detainees without charge or trial
 for extended periods of time, sometimes incommunicado.
 
 
 155
 Human rights monitors estimate that pretrial detainees arrested without war-
 rants and imprisoned without charge make up more than 90 percent of the prison
 population. The authorities do not routinely observe bail procedures.
 The African deportees from Spain, who were in custody in 1996, have all been re-
 leased and returned to their home countries. The Government began an investiga-
 tion into the matter, but at year's end has released no results.
 The Government does not use forced exile.
 e. Denial of Fair Public TriaL-The Constitution provides for an independent judi-
 ciary, but judles, who are poorly trained and paid, are sometimes subject to political
 pressures an corruption. The Supreme Court is especially vulnerable to political
 pressure, as its members are appointed by the President and serve at his pleasure.
 The judiciary is reluctant to decide cases of a political nature. Cases against sev-
 eral former and current members of the Government have continued to be delayed.
 The Supreme Court has found itself incapable of dealing impartially with highly
 charged political cases. The Court was asked to role on the constitutionality of the
 aons in naming a new government in May. The opposition charged
 that he failed to consult with political parties in Parliament, as required by the Con-
 stitution. The Court ruled that although the President's actions were unconstitu-
 tional, the decree he issued that named the Government would be allowed to stand
 for the good of the nation.
 This judgment was not the original decision written by the justice assigned to the
 case. She wrote a decision that dismissed the Government due to the unconstitution-
 ality of the decree by which it was appointed. Before her initial decision could be
 released, however, the Supreme Court President-after President Vieiras interven-
 tion-issued a press release ostensibly summarizing the Court's decision. In it be
 stated that, although the President's actions were unconstitutional, the Government
 could remain in office. After additional presidential pressure, court members forced
 the decision's author to change her decision to conform with the press release.
 Trials involving state security are conducted by civilian courts. Military courts try
 only crimes under the Code of Military Justice committed by armed forces person-
 nel. The Supreme Court is the final court of appeal for both civilian and military
 cases. The President has the authority to Gant pardons and reduce sentences.
 Citizens who cannot afford an attorney have the right to a court-appeinted lawyer.
 Traditional law still prevails in most rural areas, and urban dwellers often bring
 judicial disputes to traditional counselors to avoid the costs and bureaucratic im-
 pediments of the official system. Police often resolve disputes.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution provides for the inviolability of domicile, person, and correspondence,
 but the Government does not always respect these rights. The police do not always
 use judicial warrants and have forced entry into some private homes. International
 and domestic mail is at times opened; however, this violation is by poorly raid post-
 al employees in search of money or other valuables, not by security personnel.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech
 and the press, but journalists continue to practice self-censorship.
 In addition to the government-run newspaper, there is a daily newspaper and four
 weekly newspapers. All newspapers publish sporadically due to financial con-
 straints. The national printing press, the only facility for publishing newspapers in
 the country, often lacks the raw materials to publish them.
 There are currently three independent radio stations and one government-con-
 trolled station in Bissau. In addition Radio Portugal and Radio France international
 broadcasts are received directly from Lisbon and Paris. There are also three commu-
 nity radio stations run by the indigenous nongovernmental organization (NGO) Ac-
 tion for Development andthere are plans to open a fourth community radio station
 supported by Plan International. One independent radio station rebroadcasts British
 Broadcasting Corporation news and another has plans to begin rebroadcasts of the
 Voice of America.
 One of the community stations has faced harassment from the local authorities.
 In July two of its journalists were arrested after broadcasting an interview with a
 local farmer who was critical of a local judge. The judge ordered the station to air
 a statement diclaiming the interview. When the journalists refused, the judge
 found them in contempt of court and ordered them jailed. The National Council of
 Social Communication (Media) issued a ruling in favor of the journalists, and the
 case is to be heard by the Supreme Court, but at year's end no date had been set
 for trial, although both journalists have been released.
 Academic freedom is observed in schools and research institutions.

 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 freedom of assembly, and the Government respects this right in practice. Govern-
 ment approval is required for all assemblies and demonstrations. During the year,
 the Government approved all such requests. Numerous organizations held rallies,
 some of which were highly critical of the Government. Unlike its actions in 1996,
 the Government did not t   o prevent such demonstrations.
 Student demonstrations in May in Bissau and regional capitals turned violent.
 Demonstrators attacked government buildings and private property. In one regional
 capital, while acting to restore order and protect government personnel, the police
 fired on the demonstrators, injuring two, one severely. Five police officers were also
 injured.
 The Constitution provides for freedom of association, and the Government re-
 spects this right in practice. The Government does not prohibit or discourage ac-
 tively the formation of associations. All private associations are required to register
 with the Government.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the
 Government respects this right in practice. While religious groups must be licensed
 by the Government, none has been refused. Various faiths, including Jehovah's Wit-
 nesses, continued missionary operations during the year. The Government includes
 members from all major religious groups.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Government generally does not restrict movement within the coun-
 try, foreign travel, or emigration. However, checkpoints and police harassment
 occur. Passports are issued by the Minister of the Interior. Citizens are guaranteed
 the right to return and are not subject to political revocation of their citizenship.
 The Government allows refugees to stay if they fear persecution at home. There are
 no formal prvisions to recognize this status, but it is granted on a case-by-case
 basis. No refugees have been deported to a country where they fear persecution.
 The Government provided first asylum to refugees from the conflicts in Liberia,
 Sierra Leone, and the Casamanc region of Senegal. There are over 15,000 Senegal-
 ese refugees along the Bissauan-Senegalese border, and renewed fighting in the
 Casamance region is expected to cause their numbers to grow. The United Nations
 High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) set up a refugee camp in Jolomete, well
 south of the Senegalese border, but only 750 Senegalese refugees have agreed to re-
 locate. The Government requested this location to prevent refugees from being in-
 volved in the Casamance separatist movement. There were no reports of forced re-
 turn of persons to a country where they feared persecution.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 In 1994 voters were able to choose their government freely for the first time in
 the nation's history. The PAIGC retained power in elections judged to be free and
 fair by international observers, although they acknowledged some irregularities.
 Local elections promised by the Government since 1995 have yet to materialize.
 The Government's first local electoral law was the subject of much criticism, as it
 seemed to offer preferential treatment to areas supporting the Government. After
 a court challenge by the opposition, the Government withdrew the law and formed
 an all-party parliamentary commission to draft new legislation. The Minister of Ter-
 ritorial Administration promised local elections by the end of 1997. However, such
 elections were not expected to be held until late 1998 at the earliest since the new
 law is not drafted, the electoral census is not complete, and donors await a realistic
 funding plan from the Ministry.
 Using his emergency power clause following student demonstrations, the Presi-
 dent dismissed the country's first postelection government in May. The opposition
 and most citizens praised this action. However, ignoring a constitutional require-
 ment for consultation, the President then named a new government without ade-
 quate consultation with the political parties. The opposition filed a court challenge
 to the new Government's constitutionality. The Supreme Court ruled, in a decision
 brought on by the President's interference (see Section i.e.), that although the Presi-
 dent's action was unconstitutional, the Government could remain in office for the
 good of the nation. Public opinion was highly critical of this decision, and the opposi-
 tion charged that the Court overstepped its authority. Some opposition leaders
 called for Parliament's dissolution and new legislative elections. The President indi-
 cated that legislative elections were a possibility. Due to public sentiment, he dis-
 missed the Government, consulted with the opposition, and reappointed the same
 government.

 Women are underrepresented in the National Assembly, where they have only 8
 of the 100 seats. Three of 15 Cabinet ministers are women, including the Interior
 Minister.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The Government did not interfere with the Guinea-Bissau Human Rights League
 (LGDH-), and international human rights groups continued to investigate human
 rights abuses objectively without government harassment. Moreover, the authorities
 relationship with the IGDH appears to have improved considerably siice the new
 Government took office. The Prime Minister and the LGDH president have had sev-
 eral substantive discussions.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution and law prohibit discrimination on the basis of sex, race, and
 irligion. In practice, however, the Government does not effectively enforce these pro-
 visions.
 Women.-Physical violence, including wife beating, is an accepted means of set-
 tling domestic disputes. Although police will intervene in domestic disputes if re-
 quested, the Government has not undertaken specific measures to counter social
 pressure against reporting domestic violence, rape, incest, and other mistreatment
 of women.
 Discrimination against women persists although officially prohibited by law.
 Women are responsible for most work on subsistence farms and have limited access
 to education, especially in rural areas. Women do not have equal access to employ-
 ment. Among certain ethnic groups, women can not own or manage land nor inherit
 property.
 Children.-The Government allocates only limited resources for children's welfare
 and education.
 Female genital mutilation (FGM), which is widely condemned by international
 health exprts as damaging to both physical and psychological health, is widely
 practiced within certain ethnic groups, especially the Fulas and the Mandinkas. The
 practice is increasing as the population becomes more Muslim. The practice is now
 being performed not only on adolescent girls, but also on babies as young as 4
 months old. The Government has not outlawed the practice. It has, however, formed
 a national committee, which is conducting a nationwide education campaign to dis-
 courage it. International NG0's, including Radda Barnen (the Swedish equivalent
 of Save the Children) and Plan International, as well as several domestic NG's
 such as Friends of Children and Sinim Mira Nasseque, are working through the na-
 tional committee to eliminate FGM.
 People With Disabilities.-There is no legislation mandating accessibility. The law
 does not specifically prohibit discrimination against people with disabilities, and the
 Government does not ensure equal access to employment and education. The State
 has made some efforts to assist disabled veterans through pension progams, but
 these programs do not adequately address veterans' health, housing, and rood needs.
 Section 6. Worker Rightbs
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution provides all civilian workers with
 the freedom to form and join independent trade unions. However, the vast majority
 of the population works in subsistence agriculture. Most union members are govern-
 ment or parastatal employees; only a small percentage of workers are in the wage
 sector and are organized.
 The Government reisters all labor unions. There are 11 labor unions registered
 and operating. All umons are officially indep endent of the Government, but seven
 unions are affiliated with the National Trade Union Coneederation (UNTG), which
 retains close informal ties with the PAIGC. The law does not favor UNTG-affiliated
 unions over others. The Constitution provides for the right to strike and protection
 for workers from retribution against strike activities.
 The only legal restriction on strike activity is the requirement for prior notice.
 Lesal strikes were conducted by several unions, with no retribution against the
 strikers.
 All unions are free to affiliate freely with national confederations and inter-
 national labor organizations of their choice.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The Constitution does not
 provide or prtect the right to bargain collectively, and there were no instances of
 genuine collective bargaiinng. Most wages are established in bilateral negotiations
 betwee workers and employers, taking into consideration the minimum wslaries set
 annually by the Government's Council of Ministers.
 
 
 The Government's provisions for the protection of workers against antiunion dis-
 crimination have very little effect due to low union membership. The Government
 has not taken further action, but no workers have alleged antiunion discrimination.
 The Government adopted no laws to establish penal sanctions against employers
 practicing such discrimination. The practice is not widespread.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced or compulsory labor, in-
 cluding that performed by children, is not permitted by law. These prohibitions are
 generally enforced in the formal sector. However, children are often forced by their
 parents or guardians to work as street traders or agricultural laborers in the infor-
 mal sector (see Section 6.d.). The Government has not taken effective action to com-
 bat such practices.
 In 1996 the armed forces chief of staff, Ansumane Mane, was arrested after sev-
 eral children died in an explosion that occurred when they were forced to prepare
 shell cases for sale to Casamance rebels. Mane was placed under house arrest, but
 never formally charged; he was ultimately pardoned and reinstated by President
 Vieira.
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment.-Forced or
 compulsory labor by children is not permitted by law. This prohibition is generally
 enforced in the formal sector (see Section 6.c.).
 The General Labor Act of 1986 established a minimum age of 14 years for general
 factory labor and 18 years for heavy or dangerous labor, including all labor in
 mines. These minimum age requirements are generally followed in the small-wage
 sector, but the Ministry of Justice and Labor does not enforce these requirements
 in other sectors. Children in cities often work in street trading, and those in rural
 communities do domestic and field work without pay. The Government does not at-
 tempt to discourage these traditional practices.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The Government's Council of Ministers annu-
 ally establishes minimum wage rates for all categories of work but does not enforce
 them. The lowest monthly wage is approximately $15 (9,000 cfa francs). This wage
 is inadequate to maintain a minimum standard of living, and workers must supple-
 ment their income through other work, reliance on the extended family, and subsist-
 ence agriculture. The maximum number of hours permitted in a normal workweek
 without further compensation is 45, but the Government does not enforce this provi-
 sion.
 The Ministry of Justice and Labor establishes legal health and safety standards
 for workers, with the cooperation of the unions, which are then adopted into law
 by the National Assembly. However, these standards are not enforced, and many
 persons work under conditions that endanger their health and safety.
 Workers do not have a guaranteed right to remove themselves from unsafe work-
 ing conditions without losing their jobs. Given high unemployment, a worker who
 left for such reasons would be readily replaced.
