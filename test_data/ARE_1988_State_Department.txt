 UNITED ARAB EMIRATES
 The United Arab Emirates (UAE) is a federation of seven
 emirates, each of which retains extensive control over such
 vital matters as economic policy (including oil), internal
 security, and some aspects of defense. There are no popular
 elections, either local or federal. Instead, emirate rulers'
 legitimacy is grounded in longstanding tribal tradition. The
 seven emirate rulers comprise a Federal Supreme Council which,
 in theory, is the UAE's highest legislative and eiecutive body
 but which seldom meets. In practice, the legislative and
 executive work trickles down to the various emirates and the
 more active federal ministries. The Supreme Council selects a
 president and vice president from its membership; each serves
 a 5-year term. The president appoints a prime minister and a
 cabinet. A Federal National Council of 40 members, appointed
 by the emirate rulers, offers the Federal Government
 nonbinding advice on legislation and reviews government
 operations.
 Some of the individual emirates maintain independent internal
 security organizations, which concentrate mainly on
 antiterrorist activity.
 The economy is based on oil and gas production, which has made
 the UAE's per capita income one of the world's highest,
 despite the recent decline in oil prices. A small citizen
 population controls the country's economic life but depends
 heavily on a much larger contingent of foreigners to provide
 manual labor and technical skills. These foreigners have
 virtually no political role.
 There was no significant change in the human rights situation
 in 1988. The ruling families of the individual emirates and
 their allies continued to Play the dominant political role,
 and there was no discernible movement to extend the boundaries
 of formal political participation.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 No political killings were reported.
 b. Disappearance
 No political disappearances were reported.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 The Constitution prohibits torture or degrading treatment of
 any person, and the physical or moral abuse of an accused
 person. No instances of torture were reported in 1988.
 However, Amnesty International (AI), in its annual report
 covering 1987, noted that it had received allegations that
 several people were detained without trial and that some of
 them were tortured. A number of these persons were Iraqi
 citizens, members of the UAE-'s large expatriate community.
 There is no evidence that the authorities condone mistreatment
 of prisoners.

 UNITED ARAB EMIRATES
 There were no instances of the amputation of a hand for theft
 or stoning for adultery under the system of Shari'a law, which
 is still an integral part of the judicial system.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The Constitution prohibits- arrest, search, detention, or
 imprisonment except in accordance with the law, and the laws
 of each emirate prohibit arrest or search without probable
 cause. By law, the police must report any arrest to a judge
 within 48 hours for his determination whether to charge,
 release, or, with sufficient police justification, allow
 limited further detentio pending an investigation. Prolonged
 detention without charge is rare. Once charged, suspects come
 to trial expeditiously. In 1988 there were no reported
 instances of preventive detention. However, in its 1988
 Report, AI cites several instances of incommunicado
 detention. Consular access to imprisoned foreign nationals is
 permitted, although it is sometimes delayed.
 The Constitution prohibits the exile of citizens. Noncitizens
 convicted of crimes are subject to deportation.
 With regard to forced or compulsory labor, see Section 6.c.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The UAE has a dual system of Shari'a (clerical) and lay
 courts, each of which deals with both criminal and civil
 cases. The Shari'a courts are administered by each emirate,
 but the lay courts are usually part of the federal system and
 are answerable to the Federal Supreme Court in Abu Dhabi.
 However, Dubai's and two other smaller emirates',civil court
 systems are independent of the federal system. Each court
 system has a multilevel appeals process. Either the plaintiff
 or the nature of the case determines which court system hears
 a particular case.
 Legal counsel is readily available and permitted to represent
 a defendant in both court systems. The court may appoint
 legal counsel if counsel agrees to provide services free; no
 system of state payment of public defenders exists. However,
 the losing party may be required to pay the winner's legal
 fees.
 There are no jury trials. All cases, except.national security
 cases and those deemed by the judge likely to upset public
 morality, are open to the public. most judges are foreign
 nationals, primarily from other Arab countries. There has
 been no evidence in at least the past 3 years of rulers
 interfering in the judicial process. The court system is
 generally regarded as fair and its judgments well considered.
 There is no separate national security court system.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Constitution prohibits ehtry into homes without the
 owner's permission, except in accordance with the law.
 Although the police can enter homes without a warrant and
 without demonstrating probable cause in advance, an officer is
 answerable if.he abuses his authority in doing so. Anyone
 other than a police officer must have a court order to enter a
 private home. Local custom and practice place a high value on
 privacy, and violations are rare. Surveillance of private
 correspondence is not practiced. Except for rare instances
 
 
 1532
 UNITED ARAB EMIRATES
 involving national security, no cases of arbitrary
 interference with privacy have been reported in recent years.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 UAE citizens are constitutionally assured- freedom of speech.
 In practice, however, most inhabitants, especially- foreign
 nationals, are circumspect in public discussions of sensitive
 political topics. Although many of the local English- and
 Arabic-language newspapers are privately owned, all but one
 receive government subsidies. The press operates under a law
 which codifies the powers of censorship and media closure, and
 it generally adheres to reporting guidelines.
 These regulations, along with self-censorship by journalists,
 make official censorship rare. Local newspapers are normally
 cautious in reporting on government policy, the ruling
 families, national security, and relations with neighboring
 states.
 The censorship department of the Ministry of Information and
 Culture scrutinizes all imported newspapers, periodicals,
 films, and videos, and bans items considered pornographic,
 violent, derogatory to Islam, favorable to Israel, unduly
 critical of friendly countries, or critical of the Government
 or the ruling families.
 The Ministry of Information and Culture and some emirate
 governments own radio and television stations, and assure that
 programs and news reporting are in conformity with the
 standards imposed on the other media.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Organized public gatherings require a government permit. In
 practice, public gatherings are rare. Political parties are
 prohibited. The citizen population normally confines its
 political discussion and debate to the numerous "assemblies,"
 held in private homes, which are a local tradition. There are
 no restrictions on the formation of private associations.
 For a discussion of freedom of association as it applies to
 labor unions, see Section 6a.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Islam is the official religion. Non-Muslims are free to
 practice their religion but may not publicly proselytize or
 distribute religious literature. Foreign clergymen are
 allowed to minister to expatriate congregations.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 There are no restrictions on freedom of movement or relocation
 within the country except for security areas such as defense
 and oil installations. Unrestricted foreign travel and
 emigration are permitted to citizens. Exit visas are not
 required. The right of return is extended to all citizens.
 There are no known instances of revocation of citizenship for
 political reasons.
 The UAE and its member emirates have long accepted groups of
 displaced persons, such as Palestinians, and those attracted
 
 
 1533
 UNITED ARAB EMIRATES
 by economic opportunity, such as Iranians. Although lacking a
 formalized procedure for accepting refugees, the UAE has
 occasionally granted Iranians refuge if they could demonstrate
 that they would face persecution in Iran. The UAE in some
 instances has also helped both Iranians and Iraqis obtain
 asylum in third countries through the United Nations High
 Commissioner for Refugees. However, most Iranians, if
 intercepted attempting to enter the country illegally, are
 turned back.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 The UAE has no formal democratic institutions. Most of its
 citizens'have little or no say in the choice of leaders or
 form of government. The bulk of executive and legislative
 power is in the hands of the seven emirate rulers, their
 families, and those individuals and families to whom they are
 allied by historical ties, marriage, or common interest.
 These emirate political leaders constitute the dominant
 political force at the national level, especially through
 their use of power in the Supreme Council of emirate rulers.
 The positions and powers of individual rulers are determined
 by traditional concepts of authority rather than
 constitutional prescription. Although the rulers and ruling
 families are presumed to have the right to rule, their
 incumbency ultimately depends on the quality of their
 leadership and responsiveness to their subjects' needs. Some
 emirate rulers are accessible, in varying degree, to common
 subjects who have a problem or request. The choice of anew
 ruler falls to the ruling family, which is supposed to choose
 its most capable and respected eligible  member. In practice,
 to avoid violent succession disputes which were common in the
 past, primogeniture has become increasingly common.
 The political dominance of the ruling families is intertwined
 with their substantial involyement and influence in economic
 life. The ruling families and their close allies control and
 profit from petroleum production and, with important merchant
 families, have a major stake in the UAE's commercial life.
 With few exceptions, the large foreign community and women
 have no political role.
 In 1988 there was little indication of movement toward more
 democratic institutions.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The UAE has been responsive to foreign criticism of its human
 rights situation. For example, it has improved its labor laws
 in response to criticism that low-paid foreign workers were
 being mistreated. The UAE has no internal groups which
 monitor human rights. No outside human rights group visited
 the UAE in 1988.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Traditional attitudes about women's roles and the frequency of
 early marriage still limit women's educational and employment
 opportunities. However, women's education is advancing
 rapidly (females routinely outscore males in many subjects at
 
 
 1584
 UNITED ARAB EMIRATES
 all levels), and females now outnumber males at the UAE
 National University. The new medical school's 1988 entering
 class has more women than men. Women still rarely study
 outside the UAE. Opportunities for women are also growing in
 government service and the media, in addition to the more
 traditional fields of education and health.
 Since foreign workers can stay in the UAE only with the
 continuing approval of the Government and would probably face
 unemployment or lower wages in their country of origin, they
 are occasionally abused or exploited by employers who take
 advantage of their reluctance to protest. The Government has
 taken steps to improve the labor law covering conditions of
 employment, compensation, inspection of the workplace, and
 enforcement procedures. Foreign embassies can and do raise
 with UAE officials issues of working conditions for their
 nationals.
 Legislation which would limit the marriage of UAE citizens to
 foreigners is under consideration, and, even at present, only
 marriage to a UAE male confers citizenship. Although many
 foreigners have lived in the UAE for years and have held
 highly responsible positions, few have been granted
 citizenship.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 There is no legal provision for the right of workers to
 organize unions, or to strike. Foreign workers attempting to
 strike almost certainly would be deported.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 There is no legal provision for the right of workers to engage
 in collective bargaining. For the resolution of
 work-relateddisputes, workers have access to conciliatibn
 committees, organized by the Ministry of Labor and Social
 Affairs, and to special labor courts.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 There is no forced or compulsory labor in the UAE.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 Labor regulations prohibit employment of youths below age 18
 and restrict hours of work to 8 hours per day, 6 days per
 week. Since the children of UAE nationals have little
 incentive to work and only adult foreign workers are allowed
 in the country, there is virtually no child labor.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 Foreign nationals from Pakistan, India, the Philippines and
 Sri Lanka continue to seek work in the UAE in large numbers
 because wages are far higher than in their own countries.
 There is no minimum wage, and foreign workers' salaries often
 are inadequate to meet the cost of housing and other amenities
 at prevailing UAE standards. Most foreign workers remit as
 much of their salaries as possible to their families in their
 home countries. The pool of foreign workers, most of them
 actively recruited from abroad, meets the demand in the UAE
 for domestic and service workers and manual laborers.
 
 
 1535
 UNITED ARAB EMIRATES
 UAE law provides for a minimum of 24 days per year of annual
 leave plus 10 national and religious holidays. Though not a
 legal requirement, it is common practice for employers to give
 as a fringe benefit an annual round-trip airplane ticket for
 the employee to return home. A foreign worker must get
 permission from the previous employer to move to a new job
 with a different employer. The Government has adopted minimal
 occupational safety standards, but these are not strictly
 enforced.
