 FRANCE
 France is a democratic republic with constitutional previsions for human rights,
 freely functioning political parties, regular elections, and universal suffrage.
 France's militar/security apparatus consists of the three traditional services, a
 90,000-strng gendarmerie (national police/paramilitary force), and police forces in
 major cities. These forces come under civilian control and generally are highly pro-
 fessional. There were, however, indications that police may have used excessive
 force upon occasion, particularly against members of minority groups (see Section
 1.c.).
 France has a developed and diversified economy and a skilled labor force. It has
 substantial agricultural resources and a modern industrial system based on a mix-
 ture of public and private enterprises.
 French authorities respect human rights and civil liberties, which are provided for
 by the 1958 Constitution. Responsibility for encouraging respect for human rights
 both in France and abroad is shared among several senior officials including the
 Minister of Health and Humanitarian Affairs and the Minister-Delegate for Foreign
 Affairs. The Government consistently condemned sporadic acts of violence ag"inst
 ethnic and religious minorities, and discrimination against such groups which inter-
 fered with their integration into society.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from
 a. Political and Other Extra judicial Killing.-French authorities do not engae in
 political or other extrajudicial killings. The level of terrorism in France remained
 generally low. Four individuals were arrested in connection with the 1991 assas-
 sination near Paris of former Iranian Prime Minister Shapur Bakhtiar, but the case
 remains open. Incidents of violence perpetrated by domestic terrorist groups (par-
 ticularly Basque and Corsican separatists) continued at a steady pace but remained
 nonlethal and largely symbolic.
 b. Disappearance.-French authorities do not engage in abduction or secret ar-
 rests.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 French authorities do not condone or practice torture or cruel, inhuman, or degrad-
 ing treatment or punishment. In the occasional instances of alleged police brutality,
 there are administrative and judicial mechanisms for determining guilt and punish-
 ing transgressors.
 There was one serious complaint of excessive force used by French police against
 an American citizen who was black. The individual, whose case is under appeal, was
 apparently beaten and then tried expeditiously on narcotics charges and sentenced
 to 1 year in prison. A report entitled "Racism and Police in France," published in
 June by a nongovernmental international human rights organization, attracted at-
 tention with allegations of a "racist culture" am ong police officers (see Section 5).
 The Interior Minister disputed the report, stressing that instances of racist behavior
 are individual and not systemic and that such individuals are severely reprimanded.
 Nonetheless. arbitrary identity checks by French police officers on members of ml-
 
 
 771
 nority groups have a tendency to transform blacks and individuals from Mahreb
 countries into suspects. While any individual in France is subject to identity
 checks, minorities are stopped for questiorng mere frequently than non-minorities.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detetion,  Exie.-French law provides for freedom from ar-
 bitrary arrest and imprisonment. There is no direct equivalent of habeas corpus in
 the French legal system, but there is a limit of 2 days-4 for drug and terrorist
 cases--before a case must be referred to a magistrate for investigation.
 The judiciary plays a determining role in the detention process. There are no indi-
 cations that French authorities detained any person for political reasons. There is
 no provision for exile.
 e. Denial of Fair Public TWaL-The right to fair public trial is provided by law
 and respected in practice. Suspects are presumed innocent until proven guilty and
 have the right to legal counsel as soon as their cases are transferred from the police
 to the magistrate. For misdmeano, p retrial confinement--which is very rare-is
 limited normally to 4 months, ith extenions in special circumstaes of approxi-
 mately 8 to 12 months. Although all drug-related crimes are technicaly classified
 as misdemeanors, those convicted of serious narcotics offenses are subject to pen-
 alties otherwise reserved for felonies. Those found guilty of some drug offenses may
 be sentenced to up to 20 yers imprisonment.
 Pretrial confinement in felonies is not limited. This pretrial period can be lengthy
 depending upon the seriousness and complexity of the case, Evidence is gathered
 and assessed by an independent examining judge. Defendants are free to request
 and present evidence during this investigatory period. I August the European
 Court of Human Rights awarded substantial damages to a French citizen because
 of violence he had suffered after his arrest on a felony charge and because he had
 not been p'anted a trial within a reasonable period." He was cleared of the charges
 against him after spending 6 years in prison awaiting trial
 ~rials in France are no  y open and public, but p revisions exist for the defense
 to request a closed proceeding. All felonies are tried bfore juries, and a defendant
 does not have the right to refuse a jury trial. The press has free access to records
 of court proceedings, although under French law the prosecutor may not disclose in-
 formation about cases being tried or investigated.
 Amid a widely.publicized series of indictments of public officials for alleged in-
 volvement in kickbacks and campaign-financing scandals, Government officials de-
 clared their concern about the protection of the right of the accused. One case in-
 volved charges of influence-peddling against the National Assembly President in his
 former capacity as treasurer of the Socialist Party. The official subsequently filed
 suit ag  st the judge clai in  the indictment was politically motivated and that
 the judge had released confidential information. The case has not yet been heard.
 French law provides for the right of appeal for those convicted of misdemeanors
 Those convicted of felonies may appeal to the Court of Casmation only on procedural
 grounds.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-French
 law provides for freedom frominvasion of privacy, and this freedom is respected in
 price. The search of a private residence ma     carrie out by police if there is
 reason to believe a crime is taking place within. The search may only be carried
 out between 9    _.m  and 6 p.ma, ecept in special circmstances, such as in drug
 cases when the search may be undertaken at any time. Telephone conversations
 may be monitored by authority of a court order in conjunction with criminal pro-
 ceedings. However, no court order is required in national security cases.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-Freedom of speech and press are guaranteed
 by law and respected in practice. Newspapers and magazines are free from govern-
 ment control and present views ranging across the political spectrum. Under French
 law, high government officials may pursue media representatives for defamation. In
 practice, therse provisions are rarely invoked and do not interfere with free expres-
 sion. There are three state-oivned and three private television networks, in addition
 to private cable channels. Hundreds of private radio stations offer a wide array of
 independent, uncensored programming in French and several other languages. Aca-
 demic freedom of expression is respected in both public and private academic insti-
 tutions.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-Freedom of peaceful assembly
 and association is widely respected in France, although--except for a specific ref-
 erence to trade unions--it is not mentioned in the Constitution. Groups wishing to
 organize public meetings, protest marches or demonstrations must declare their in-
 tent to do so to local authorities. Normally these authorities raise no objection to
 either political or nonpolitical gatherings. On occasion, however, local authorities
 
 
 772
 
 have denied permission to extremist groups, such as during periods preceding re-
 gional elections in March and the September referendum on the Maastricht Treaty.
 While the decision to deny permission for a demonstration rests within the discre-
 tion of local officials, a denial may be appealed to the Council of State. Private asso-
 ciations, whether political or apolitical must register with the prefecture in the de-
 partment in which they are established, but they do not require the prefecture's au-
 thorization to exist. Such registration is considered routine in France. Informal asso-
 ciations, such as those without officers, bylaws, or dues, need not register.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-All religions are tolerated. Roman Catholics are by far
 the largest religious group. Separation of church and state is guaranteed by law,
 although both private and parochial schools receive substantial subsidies from the
 Ministry of National Education.
 d. Freedom of Movement within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-French law provides for freedom of internal movement foreign travel,
 emigration, and repatriation. All lawful resident aliens, including refugees, may un-
 dertake foreign travel and, in most instances, return to France. France has a long
 history as a haven for refugees. For that reason, there was considerable debate con-
 cerning a new law regulating special areas at French airports and ports. The new
 law designates the areas as waiting zones* and provides that within 4 days of ap-
 plying for entry into (or asylum in) France an applicant who has not been admitted
 will have access to a judge. The law also limits to a maximum of 20 days the time
 travelers can be detained in waiting zones. Representatives of human rights groups
 are allowed into the zones as monitors.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The people have the right and ability to change their  vernment by peaceful
 means, not only through the election of the President, the  ational Assembly, and
 local officials but also through amendment of the Constitution by means of national
 referendum. For example, following parliamentary amendment of the Constitution
 in June to bring it into alignment with the Maastricht Treaty, a referendum was
 held on the question of ratification of the Treaty. Seventy-one percent of eligible vot-
 ers participated.
 While the French generally question the notion of "indigenous" peoples, an at-
 tempt is made to take local traditions into account within the administration of
 some French overseas territories where distinct ethnic groups have preserved such
 traditions and customs.
 Varying special statutes--applicable to all citizens resident within the respective
 territories, regardless of ethnic origin-govern the "collective territory' of Mayotte
 and the territories of French Polynesia, Wallis and Futuna, and New Caledonia. The
 citizens of these territories determine their legal and political relationships to
 France by means of referendums.
 In spite of differences in their respective administrative statutes-and resulting
 differences in local government entities--French citizens within the territories par-
 ticipate fully in the political process, electing both deputies and senators to the
 French Parliament. All French citizens who have reached the age of 18 may vote,
 except for most convicted criminals, bankrupt persons, and persons certified to be
 mentally incompetent. These provisions are fully respected in practice.
 Presidential elections are held every 7 years, and elections for the National As-
 sembly are held every 5 years, unless the Government is dissolved, in which case
 elections may be called sooner. Voting is by secret ballot. A wide variety of political
 parties compete freely in regularly scheduled national and local elections. Many spe-
 cial interest groups-business, labor, veterans, consumer advocates, ecologists, and
 others-organize freely and regularly support candidates for elective office.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vest igation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Both local and international human rights organizations operate freely in France.
 The French National Consultative Commission on Human Rights, which monitors
 complaints and advises the Government on policies and legislation, is an independ-
 ent body within the Prime Minister's Office.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Language, or Social Status
 Statutes ban discrimination based on race, religion, sex, ethnic background, or po-
 litical opinion. Nevertheless, anti-immigrant sentiment continued to provoke inci-
 dents of racism directed at the large Arab/Muslim and black African immigrant
 communities, as well as toward the Jewish population. The National Consultative
 Commission on Human Rights published a poll m March which showed that 41 per-
 cent of the French declared themselves to be "rather" or "a little" racist. In August
 
 
 773
 nearly 200 graves were vandalized at a Jewish cemetery in Herrilsheim in eastern
 France. The Government and a wide spectrum of public opinion have consistently
 condemned such incidents. Du     1992 a new penal code was approved (to go into
 effect in 1993); it mets up an esaati7ag scale of penalties for desecration and related
 activities.
 There was increased public and governmental recognition of past crimes commit-
 ted against Jewish citizens. President Mitterrand, as well as Cabinet ministers and
 religious and political leaders, attended a July memorial service commemorating the
 1942 "Vel' d hv" roundup and deportation of more than 12,000 French Jews to
 German concentration camps. In this connection, there was a spirited media debate
 about crimes committed during the Vichy regime.
 Another subject debated widely was the initial decision of a French tribunal not
 to prosecute two former Vichy police officials, Paul Touvier and Rene Bousquet, for
 crimes against humanity. The court also found no basis for prosecution against
 Touvier on charges of responsibility for the deportation of two French Jews who
 later died in concentration camps. Appeals against that dismissal began in June,
 and-amid protests of the decision within the Jewish community and by leading
 government figures-the case prompted discussion of whether changes should be
 made in the new penal code to define more precisely "crimes against humanity." In
 November the Appellate Court partially reversed the lower court's decision, and the
 case remains open. In the meantime, Bousquet has been charged in another court.
 In September a government-sponsored report noted special difficulties faced by Af-
 rican immigrants in securing appropriate housing, in part because the majority (ap-
 roximately 70 percent) live in the densely populated Paris region. The report also
 twith cultural factors which have a negative effect on the performance of Afri-
 can immigrant children in French schools.
 The French are assertive about the primacy of the French language in the edu-
 cational system but are tolerant of the numerous residents of France who have non-
 French origins and whose mother tongue is not French.
 The Government strongly condemns and vigorously attempts to prevent violence
 and abuse against women, and such violence, including wife beating, is prohibited
 under article 309 of the Penal Code. In 1992, a law was added to the Code providing
 penalties of up to one year in prison and up to approximately $20,000 in fines for
 supervisors convicted of sexually harassing employees.
 While French law requires that women reeive equal pay for equal work, this re.
 quirement is not met in minny cases. Women's rights groups actively lobby for full
 implementation of equal rights statutes and seek solutio"ns to the increasingly pub-
 licized phenomenon of violence against women.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Freedom of association for trade unions is provided
 for by the Constitution. Although less than 10 percent (12-15 percent for the public
 sector, 5-6 percent for the private sector) of the work force is unionized, trade
 unions exercise significant economic and political influence. Their principal role and
 legitimacy derive from elections held by workers for professional works councils and
 other tripartite (Government, employer and worker)bodies dealing with social mat-
 ters. These include labor courts and the Economic and Social Council, a constitu-
 tionally mandated consultative body.
 Most unions pride themselves on not being aligned with any political party, and
 all are careful to avoid being stigmatized as government-influenced. However, many
 of the leaders of the General Confederation of Labor (CGT) and its unions belong
 to the Communist Party. Tradition prevents union officials from holding office injo-
 litical parties, but leaders of most non-CGT unions are supporters of the Sociaist
 Party. Supporters of other parties are also active in the labor movement. There are
 no restrictions on the unions' international activities, and all three world trade
 union confederations have French affiliates.
 French workers, including civil servants, are free to strike with a few exceptions
 in cases where strikes are determined to be a threat to public safety. Given that
 one-fourth of the salaried population works for one level or another of the Govern-
 ment the numerous public sector strikes receive extensive media coverage.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Workers, including those in
 the 3 small export processing zones, have the right to organize and bargain collec-
 tively. French law strictly prohibits antiunion discrimination. Amendments added in
 1982 require at least annual bargaining on wages, hours, and working conditions
 at both plant and industry levels. The 1982 law does not irem  that negotiations
 result in a signed contract. Outside mediators, drawn from the upper ranks of the
 civil service, may impose solutions that are binding unless formally rejected by ei-
 ther side within a week. Over 80 percent of France's private sector work force is
 
 
 774
 covered by collective bargaining agreements negotiated variously at national or local
 levels. There are also trilateral consultations on such subjects as the minimum
 wage, temporary work, social security, and unemployment benefits.
 French law requires that businesses with mere than 50 employees have a works
 council, in which workers are consulted on training, working conditions, profit-shar-
 ing, and similar issues. Works councils are open to both union and nonunion em-
 ployees, and elections are held every 2 years.
 Trade union rights as provided for in the Constitution, extend to France's over-
 seas departments and territories. Social benefits, such as the minimum wage or sup-
 plemental retirement payments may be reduced in the overseas departments and
 territories to take into account the local economies.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced or compulsory labor is pro-
 hibited by law, and this prohibition is effectively enforced.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-With a few exceptions for those
 enrolled in recognized apprenticeship programs, children under the age of 16 may
 not be employed. Generally, work considered arduous or work between the hours of
 10 p.m. and 5 a.m. may not be performed by minors under the age of 18. Laws pro-
 hibiting child employment are effectively enforced through periodic checks by labor
 inspectors.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-France has an administratively determined
 minimum wage, revised whenever the cost of living index rises two percentage
 points, and which is sufficient to provide a decent standard of living to a worker
 and family. The legal workweek is 39 hours; in an effort to increase employment,
 overtime is restricted to 9 hours per wek. The previously discriminatory law pro-
 hibitin women from performig arduous or night work, except in certain exempted
 categories such as hospitals  d a few service industries, was revoked in 1992. In
 this regard, France joined other Eurpean Community signatories in denouncing the
 International Labor Organization (ILO) Convention 89 banning night work for
 women, and in adhering to the new non-discriminatory ILO Convention -171 on
 night work.
 French labor legislation and practices, including those pertaining to occupational
 safety and health, are fully comparable to those in other industrialized market econ-
 omy countries. The Ministry of Labor has overall responsibility for policing occupa-
 tional safety and health laws. Standards are generally high and well enforced. To
 assist the Ministry, French law requires that any enterprise with 50 or more em-
 ployees have an occupational health and safety committee. Sixty-five percent of all
 enterprises covering 80 percent of employees had such committees as of 1989.
