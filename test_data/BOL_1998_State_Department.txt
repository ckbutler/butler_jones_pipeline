 BOLIVIA
 A constitutional, multiparty democracy with an elected president and bicameral
 legislature, Bolivia has separate executive, legislative, and judicial branches with an
 attorney general independent of all three. The judiciary, while independent, is cor-
 rupt and inefficient. The executive and legislative branches share these defects to
 
 
 508
 some extent. The Government continued to implement constitutional amendments
 to reform the judicial system, which were passed in 1994; the reforms were partially
 completed by the end of 1998.
 The National Police have primary responsibility for internal security, but military
 forces can be called upon-for help in critical situations. Military forces provided se-
 curity for coca eradication work crews in the Chapare region. A special antinarcotics
 force (FELCN), including the Mobile Rural Patrol Unit (UMOPAR), is dedicated to
 antinarcotics enforcement. Civilian authorities maintain effective control over the
 security forces, but some members of these forces committed human rights abuses.
 Bolivia has extensive poverty, and many citizens lack access to such basic services
 as potable water, sewage, electricity and primary health care. Per capita gross do-
 mestic product (GDP) is about $930. The country is rich in minerals and hydro-
 carbons, and extensive investments in petroleum deposits in the eastern part of the
 country are expected to form a basis for strong GDP growth in the future. However,
 most workers engage in traditional agriculture, and many citizens remain barely
 linked to the cash economy.
 The Government generally respected the human rights of its citizens; however,
 legal and institutional deficiencies prevented their full protection. Human rights
 groups criticized the FELON and the UMOPAR for alleged abuses against coca
 growers and peasants in the Chapare region. As many as 13 civilians and 2 police-
 men were kildin confontations in that region early in the year. The Government
 acknowledged responsibility for 5 of the 13 deaths but failed to complete investiga-
 tions to determine the exact circumstances of these deaths. There were credible re-
 ports of abuses by police, including use of excessive force, petty theft, extortion, and
 improper arrests. Investigations of alleged official abuses were slow. The most per-
 vasive human rights abuse continued to be prolonged incarceration of detainees due
 to antiquated procedures and inefficiency and corruption in the judicial system.
 Other problems include harsh prison conditions, government attempts to intimidate
 some news media, discrimination against and abuse of women and indigenous peo-
 ple, abuse of children, and inhuman working conditions in the mining industry.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of politically
 motivated killings. However, as many as 13 civilians were killed in the course of
 law enforcement operations that encountered armed resistance from coca growers.
 Although the precise causes and circumstances of these deaths have not been deter-
 mined officially, there is no credible evidence that the security forces used force ex-
 cept in self-defense. However, it also is not clear whether or not their use of force
 was excessive. The Government has not investigated fully any of these deaths.
 Beginning on April 1, a series of clashes between protesting coca growers and se-
 curity forces led to the deaths of at least 13 civilians and 2 policemen. Four of the
 civilians and the two policemen died of gunshot wounds. Two civilians died of al-
 leged tear gas asphyxiation. Autopsies were performed on only three of the civilian
 victims; the Government stated that the bodies of the rest were withheld from secu-
 rity forces and buried without autopsy, precluding definitive conclusions regarding
 the causes of death.
 On May 9, more fighting broke out between government security forces and coca
  owers. A group of about 250 peasant farmers attacked an eradication work crew.
 vernment forces claimed that they were shot at first, after which they returned
 fire with tear gas and live ammunition. Three farmers were wounded. On May 12,
 a topographer from DIRECO, the Government's coca eradication agency, was beaten
 as he was travelling to work. He received superficial injuries. On May 13, another
 eradication work crew was attacked by a group of peasants, and one civilian re-
 ceived a nonfatal bullet wound. On May 21, growers ambushed and fired on an
 eradication convoy on a major highway, killing a police officer and wounding five
 others. In total, as many as 85 civilians and 60 policemen were wounded during
 these and similar clashes, which lasted from April 1 to June 5.
 On June 5, coca growers killed a police officer, who was providing protection to
 an eradication work crew, during an ambush. Security forces did not return fire in
 this ambush or the May 21 ambush.
 On November 26, Ombudsman Ana Maria Romero de Campero accused army
 troops of terrorizing the village of Puerto Zudanes and forcing its residents to flee.
 The Government denied the charges and accused Campero of siding with coca grow-
 ers. She opened an investigation but had not completed a report by year's end.
 The Government has not released the final results of its investigations into the
 deaths in the serious and violent incidents in 1997 in the Chapare region or the
 
 
 deaths in the Amayapampa confrontations in December 1996. An investigation by
 the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR) found that security
 forces committed excesses resulting in the deaths of 9 civilians and 32 persons
 wounded in Amayapampa and that the Government did not act to identify and pun-
 ish those responsible; the Attorney General has yet to complete a long-promised re-
 port on these deaths. In addition, the authorities have not recaptured the police offi-
 cer accused in 1994 of murdering coca worker Felipe Perez Ortiz; the officer escaped
 from custody in September of that year. The Government's failure to complete effec-
 tive investigations and identify and punish those responsible for either civilian or
 police deaths results in an atmosphere of impunity and a condition that almost
 amounts to lawlessness.
 The October arrest of former Chilean dictator General Augusto Pinochet in the
 United Kingdom drew renewed attention to extrajudicial killings and other abuses
 that occurred during the 1971-78 de facto regime of President Hugo Banzer Suarez.
 There were renewed allegations that his regime participated in Operation Condor,
 a regional plan to eliminate leftists. Political leaders and family members of victims
 called for new investigations, and at year's end the House of Deputies assembled
 documents and drew up a list of seven Bolivians believed to have been held, tor-
 tured, or killed in Chile during Pinochet's rule. The Permanent Assembly for
 Human Rights forwarded this material to Spanish judge Baltasar Garzon, who was
 preparing the case against Pinochet.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Government honors the constitutional prohibition against torture. However,
 there were a number of significant allegations of torture-two by the police and one
 by coca growers. In June the body of Donaciano Para Mejia was found in the town
 of Cristal Mayu. Although coca growers alleged that Para had been tortured and
 killed, an autopsy concluded that Parra died of a heart attack and that apparent
 bruises found on his body were from exposure to the elements. On September 25,
 the authorities arrested two National Police officers and charged them with at-
 tempting to burn a drunken man. According to reports, the policemen apprehended
 the man, forced him to take his clothes off, poured alcohol on him, and set him afire.
 Both policemen were suspended; the Minister of Government announced that they
 would be subject to an internal investigation and later turned over to the civil
 courts and charged.
 On September 23, coca growers kidnaped three policemen in La Paz and subjected
 them to torture. In a statement, the Vice Director of Police said the incident oc-
 curred during confrontations between the police and protesting coca grwers. The
 kidnapers took the policemen to the Greater San Andres University, whe the coca
 growers stayed while in La Paz, beat them, and burned them with boiling water.
 They held the three men for 5 hours in refrigeration units of the school cafeteria
 (the refrigerators were not functioning at the time) and freed them later in the
 evening.
 Several police officers were fired and charged for off-duty crimes including theft
 and rape. In general, however, the police were not disposed to investigate their own
 colleagues, and prosecutors were reluctant to prosecute security officials for alleged
 offenses committed while on duty. Neither the technical and judicial police nor pros-
 ecutors receive human rights training. The Congress has yet to take action on the
 1995 report of its Human Rights Commission resurrecting allegations that police of-
 ficials had in past years tortured captured terrorists and recommending that crimi-
 nal proceedings be opened against a number of named officers.
 Prison conditions are harsh. Prisons are overcrowded, and conditions can be life
 threatening for inmates without money. There were 5,577 prisoners in facilities de-
 signed to hold about one-half that number. Ability to pay can determine cell size,
 visiting privileges, day-pass eligibility, and place or even length of confinement. Cell
 pries range from $20 to $5,000, p aid to prior occupants or to prisoners who control
 cell blocks. In the poorest parts of San Pedro prison in La Paz, for example, inmates
 occupy tiny cells (3 by 4 by 6 feet) with no ventilation, lighting, or beds. Crowding
 in some "low-rent" sections obliges inmates to sleep sitting up. Children up to 6
 years old may live with an incarcerated parent. The authorities worked to remove
 such children from the prisons, and according to a December report, the number had
 dropped from over 1,200 children to fewer than 400. If such children have nowhere
 else to go, the Government considers it more humane to support them in prison
 than to leave them homeless in the streets. The standard prison diet, according to
 a 1995 study, can cause anemia; the diet has not been improved since then. There
 is no adequate health care within the prisons, and it is very difficult for prisoners
 to get permission for medical treatment outside. However, affluent prisoners can ob-
 tain transfers to preferred prisons or even to outside private institutional care for
 
 
 "'medical" reasons. Drugs and alcohol are readily available for those inmates who
 can pay.
 Convicted juvenile prisoners are not segregated from adult prisoners in jails. Re-
 habilitation programs for juveniles or other prisoners are scarce to nonexistent. The
 Government has acknowledged these problems but does not have sufficient re-
 sources to correct them quickly.
 The incidence of violence in the Chapare coca growing region increased during
 1998 as armed "self-defense groups" opposed the eradication of illegal coca. There
 were reports that coca growers unions used physical coercion and intimidation to
 prevent farm workers from cooperating with the Government in coca eradication. In-
 digenous groups complained that armed coca growers continued to invade their
 lands by force and coerce or bribe their members to cultivate illegal coca.
 Indigenous communities in areas with little or no central government presence
 impose punishment reliably reported to include the death penal on members who
 violate traditional laws or rules, although such punishment is forbidden by the Con-
 stitution.
 The Government permits prison visits by human rights monitors and news media
 representatives.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Arrests are carried out openly. The law
 requires a valid warrant, which a court must confirm within 48 hours. However,
 there were credible reports that these legal safeguards were violated in some cases.
 The police temporarily arrested large numbers of civilians in April and-May in
 connection with confrontations with coca growers (see Section L.a.). All were re-
 leased shortly after arrest. On September 23, police and coca growers clashed vio-
 lently in La Paz, wounding three protesters and six police officers. The police took
 six protesters into custody.
 Denial of justice through prolonged detention remains the most pervasive human
 rights problem. Judicial corruption, a shortage of public defenders, inadequate case-
 tracking mechanisms, and complex criminal justice procedures keep persons incar-
 cerated for months, or even years, before trial. The Constitution provides for judicial
 determination of the legality of detention. Prisoners are released if a judge rules de-
 tention illegal, but the process can take months. Prisoners may see a lawyer, but
 approximately 70 percent cannot afford legal counsel, and public defenders are over-
 burdened. Bail exists, except in some drug cases, and is generally granted.
 The Government continued to address the problem of delay of justice by imple-
 menting the 1994 constitutional reforms to streamline the judicial system and by
 taking measures to correct other deficiencies as they come to light. Although large
 numbers of prisoners continued to be released under the Personal Recognizance Law
 promulgated in 1996, most prisoners still await either trial or sentencing.
 The expanding public defender program pursues an active approach by distribut-
 ing concise information about human rights to the populace and seeking to be in-
 volved in arrest cases at the earliest possible juncture to ensure that human rights
 and due process are honored. The new program of mobile public defenders who can
 reach the more remote parts of the country has proven effective, obtaining the con-
 ditional or provisional release (often on bail) of arrested persons in about 60 percent
 of the cases handled, and is being extended to additional isolated regions.
 Children from 11 to 16 years of age can be detained indefinitely in children's cen-
 ters for known or suspected offenses, or for their protection, simply on the orders
 of a social worker. There is no judicial review.
 The 1997 abduction case of Waldo Albarracin, President of the Bolivian Perma-
 nent Assembly for Human Rights (APDH), continued to move slowly through the ju-
 dicial system. On February 11, the Chamber of Deputies approved a report by the
 Constitutional Commission and voted to have" former Police Commander Willy
 Arriaza and four other police officials tried in civil court for the abduction, unlawful
 detention, and beating of Albarracin. The Chamber also ruled that charges against
 one of the defendants, General Hernan Cortez Vargas, should be dropped, since it
 found that Cortez was forced by his superiors to sign the order to arrest Albarracin.
 However, no further action was taken in this case by year's end.
 The Government does not use forced exile as a punishment.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-Although the judiciary is independent, corruption
 and intimidation in the judicial system remain major problems. Poor pay and work-
 ing conditions help make judges and prosecutors susceptible to bribes. Five Supreme
 Court justices were the subjects of corruption allegations or lawsuits that have not
 been resolved.
 The judicial system has four levels: Investigative, trial, and superior courts, with
 the Supreme Court at the apex.
 Police present the case of an arrested person to a prosecutor. If the prosecutor
 decides to prosecute, the case is then submitted to an investigative court, which de-
 
 
 cides whether there is sufficient evidence to issue an indictment; if so, the case goes
 to a trial court. The trial court's decision may be appealed to superior court and,
 eventually, to the Supreme Court. Cases of persons arrested under the counter-
 narcotics law go directly from a special prosecutor to the trial court. The trial court's
 decision must be reviewed by the district superior court, which may confirm, lower,
 raise, or annul the sentence, or impose a sentence where there was none before.
 Both the district prosecutor and the defense attorney may make recommendations
 and comments at this stage. Superior court decisions in narcotics cases must be re-
 viewed by the Supreme Court, whose decision is final. Under the Personal Recog-
 nizance Law, persons who are absolved or found innocent in either of the two first
 instances may then be granted provisional liberty while they await the mandatory
 higher reviews.
 The authorities generally respect the constitutional provision of the right to a fair
 public trial. However, the maximum time periods permitted by law for different
 stages of the judicial process frequently are exceeded. Supreme Court justices admit
 that it is sometimes difficult to assemble the quorum needed for decisions, and con-
 sequently the Court's rulings are unduly delayed.
 Defendants have the right to an attorney, to confront witnesses, to present evi-
 dence, and to appeal judicial decisions. The authorities generally honor these rights.
 Although the law provides for a defense attorney at public expense if needed, one
 is not always promptly available. The highly formal and corrupt judicial system
 makes it difficult for poor, illiterate persons to have effective access to courts and
 legal redress.
 The Government took major steps to improve the system of justice. The President
 swore in the Judicial Council, Constitutional Tribunal, and Ombudsman, the first
 such institutions in the country's history. The Judicial Council was established to
 act as the administrative and disciplinary body of the justice system. The Constitu-
 tional Tribunal is to handle all constitutional issues, and the Ombudsman is to
 serve as a direct link between ordinary citizens and the judicial process. The Judi-
 cial Council has suspended 30 judges and fined or placed another 200 on probation
 because they misapplied the law or unlawfully delayed the judicial process.
 In 1997 a revised Criminal Code was adopted containing stronger provisions for
 the protection of life and against official corruption. A new Law on Civil Processes
 and Family Assistance shortened the periods allowed for various stages of civil suits
 and eliminated some opportunities for delaying tactics by attorneys. At year's end,
 Congress was debating a far-ranging revision of the Code of Criminal Procedures,
 which was expected to take effect in 1999.
 The Government is also expanding its urban public defenders program. There are
 12 offices nationwide, with a total of 60 employees. Plans are underway to increase
 the number of defenders and legal assistants by 36. The additional employees are
 expected to allow lawyers to increase the number of cases they can handle.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution provides for the sanctity of the home and the privacy of citizens. Al-
 though the authorities generally respect these provisions, there have been credible
 allegations of UMOPAR abuses involving illegal searches and thefts of property
 from homes. Residents in the coca-growing areas generally are reluctant to file and
 pursue formal complaints. The Human Rights Office of the Ministry of Justice in
 the Chapare region accepts and pursues complaints of human rights abuses commit-
 ted by anyone, including police, narcotics traffickers, and coca growers.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for the fundamental
 right to express ideas and opinions freely by any means of dissemination. There are,
 however, some limitations on freedom of speech. The Penal Code provides that per-
 sons found guilty of insulting, defaming, or slandering public officials for carrying
 out their duties may be jailed from 1 month to 2 years. If the insults are directed
 against the President, Vice President, or a Minister, the sentence may be increased
 by one-half.
 State-owned and private radio and television stations operate freely. Newspapers
 are privately owned, and most adopt antigovernment positions. There were credible
 reports of government attempts to intimidate some news media to provide more fa-
 vorable coverage.
 The Government respects academic freedom, and the law grants public univer-
 sities autonomous status.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The law provides for the rights
 of peaceful assembly and association, and the authorities respect them in practice.
 The Government routinely grants permits for marches and rallies and, as a rule,
 
 
 the authorities try to avoid confronting demonstrators. However, police clashed with
 union and other demonstrators on some occasions. Labor, political, and student
 groups carried out many demonstrations and rallies in La Paz and other cities
 throughout the year, particularly during the first quarter. The authorities inter-
 vened only when rallies became dangerously violent or interfered substantially with
 normal civic activity.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-Roman Catholicism predominates, and the Constitution
 recognizes it as the official religion. However, citizens may practice the religion of
 their choice. About 400 religious groups, mostly Protestant, are active. Missionary
 groups must register with the Foreign Ministry as nongovernmental organizations
 (NGO's); there was no indication that they were treated differently from other
 NGO's. The Ministry did not disallow any registrations by missionary groups.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-There are no restrictions on travel. The law permits emigration and
 provides for the right to return. The Government does not revoke citizenship for po-
 litical reasons.
 The Government cooperates with the office of the United Nations High Commis-
 sioner for Refugees and other humanitarian organizations in assisting refugees. Ref-
 ugees have been accepted for resettlement. The issue of the provision of first asylum
 did not arise. After the 1996 takeover of the Japanese Ambassador's residence in
 Lima, Peru by Tupac Amaru terrorists, the authorities found that some MRTA ac-
 tivists had used Bolivia as a safehaven and announced a more restrictive policy on
 accepting Peruvian political asylees. Nonetheless, MRTA terrorists continued to use
 the country as a safehaven and a place to plan activities.
 There were no reports of persons forced to return to a country where they feared
 persecution
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The Constitution provides citizens with the right to change their government
 peacefully, and citizens exercise this right in practice through periodic, free, and fair
 elections held on the basis of universal suffrage. Political parties ranging from far
 left to moderate right function openly. Implementing regulations for the 1994 con-
 stitutional revisions provide for half of the congressional deputies to be elected indi-
 vidually and directly, rather than from party lists. The first national election under
 these regulations was held in June 1997, with attendance by international observ-
 ers. Only one instance of tampering with ballots was detected.
 No legal impediments exist to women or indigenous people voting, holding politi-
 cal office, or rising to political leadership. Nevertheless, the number of women and
 indigenous people who have prominent positions in politics remains small. Political
 parties acceded to demands from women that they be allocated a fair share of the
 candidacies in the 1997 national elections, approving a law that every third can-
 didate on party lists must be female. There are 14 women among the 157 deputies
 and senators; there are also 2 female ministers in the Cabinet.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Aleged Violations of Human Rights
 A number of human rights groups operate without government restriction, inves-
 tigating and publishing their findings on human rights cases. Government officials
 are generally cooperative and responsive to their views. However, they criticize
 human rights advocates for paying attention exclusively to the negative aspects of
 the Government's performance. In 1997 the Government asked the IACHR to inves-
 tigate the December 1996 Amayapampa violence and cooperated in the subsequent
 investigation. The Human Rights Commission of the Congress is very active and fre-
 quently criticizes the Government publicly.
 In March Congress elected former newspaper editor Ana Maria Romer de
 Campero as the first Ombudsman. The Government has established 9 human rights
 offices around the country along with 12 public defenders offices. The human rights
 office in the Chapare has come under threat from coca growers and has complained
 to the Government that security is not adequate to complete its tasks.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution prohibits discrimination based on race, sex, language, religion,
 political or other opinion, origin, or economic or social condition. Nonetheless, there
 was significant discrimination against women, indigenous people, and the small
 black minority.
 Women.-Violence against women is pervasive. A study by the National Institute
 of Statistics found that 40 percent of all reported violent attacks in La Paz depart-
 
 
 ment in 1992-93 (the most recent statistics available) were perpetrated against
 women. A total of 11,069 complaints of violence against women were registered in
 La Paz during this period. The Government estimates that there are about 100,000
 incidents of violence against women annually nationwide and that as many as 95
 percent of them go unpunished. The Congressional Committee on Women stated
 that an average of 3.5 cases of rape or statutory rape were reported each day for
 the first half of 1995 and estimated that twice that many cases were not reported.
 The Government continued to implement programs to protect women. During the
 1997-98 legislative year, the Government, the legislature, and several civil society
 organizations debated the issue of sexual harassment, which yielded a 1997 draft
 Law Against Sexual Harassment. While the bill continues to be considered in the
 Chamber of Deputies, the debate engendered is expected to ensure action during the
 next ordinary session of Congress. The Penal Code does not define sexual harass-
 ment as a crime; authorities must try persons accused of harassment under other
 penal provisions. There are no statistics on the incidence of sexual harassment, but
 the problem is generally acknowledged to exist widely in the male-oriented society.
 In 1995 the Government promulgated the Law on Domestic and Family Violence,
 which makes rape a public crime and broadens the definition of family member
 abuse. Public agencies state that reported incidents of abuse have increased mark-
 edly as a result of the new law, as citizens become more aware of the problem and
 of the availability of help. In December the Chamber of Deputies approved a bill
 to provide benefits and protection for domestic workers, including specific protection
 from physical, psychological, and sexual aggression.
 Legal services offices devoted to family and women's rights operate throughout
 the country. Family protection police units, staffed by specially trained officers, in-
 cluding women, are also active.
 A medical security program inaugurated in July 1996 provides free medical care
 to women of reproductive age and to children under the age of 5, based on economic
 need.
 There were reports of trafficking in women for purposes of prostitution. A union
 leader asserted that employment agencies lure rural indigenous women to cities
 with promises of employment as domestic servants but then force them to work
 without salaries to repay transport and other fees and sometimes turn them over
 to houses of prostitution.
 Women generally do not enjoy a social status equal to that of men. Many women
 do not know their legal rights. Traditional prejudices and social conditions remain
 obstacles to advancement. Women generally earn less than men for equal work.
 Young girls often leave school early to work at home or in the economy. According
 to a recent study by the Secretary of Education, four out of five illiterate Bolivians
 are female. Although not effectively enforced, the national labor law is overprotec-
 tive in some aspects, limiting women to a workday 1 hour shorter than that of men
 and prohibiting them from working at night.
 Children.-The Government is aware of the precarious situation of children and
 the need to provide legal and institutional infrastructure for their protection. Seven
 Defender of Children and Adolescents offices were opened in La Paz to help protect
 children's rights and interests. However, the Government has not given the poor sit-
 uation of children sufficient political priority to ensure that it will bb corrected
 quickly and effectively.
 Although the law requires all children to complete at least 5 years of primary
 school, this requirement is poorly enforced, particularly in rural areas. Statistics
 from the Ministry of Planning's Education Reform Team show that in rural areas,
 oniy 0.7 percent of girls and 1.4 percent of boys finish high school; in urban areas,
 26 percent of girls and 31 percent of boys do so. The 1994 Education Refor Act
 sought to improve the situation of children; even optimistic observers, however,
 noted that it woud take years for it to have an impact. Prolonged teachers' strikes
 often result in lengthy school closures, limiting c ldren's access to education.
 The National Institute of Statistics calcuated in 1995 that 47 percent of children
 in La Paz were chronically undernourished, and that 10 percent of the children mi-
 grating from rural areas showed evidence of acute malnutrition.
 Many children, particularly from rural areas, lack the birth certificates and iden-
 tity documents they need to secure social benefits and protection. There are credible
 allegations that as many as 200 juveniles, for instance, are incarcerated as adults
 in the San Pedro jail for lack of reliable civil documents proving their ages. The Mi-
 nors' Code promulgated in 1992 has proven inadequate; a new Minors' Code intro-
 duced in the Congress in 1997 had not been passed by year's end.
 According to a 1995 report by the director of the National Institute of Child Devel-
 opment, 96,000 children have mental disabilities, 37,000 have physical disabilities,
 
 
 4,000 have hearing impairments, and 2,500 have visual impairments. Because of
 scarce resources, only about 6,000 of these children have access to specialized help.
 Government surveys suggest that about 1 million children (or about 1 child in 3)
 suffer physical or psychological abuse-13 percent of them at school, where corporal
 punishment and,verbal abuse are common, and 87 percent at home. About 20 per-
 cent of these children suffer abuse severe enough to result in bruises, scars, or
 burns. Although laws provide safeguards against children working, they are not ef-
 fectively enforced, and about 216,000 children work, usually to help provide for fam-
 ily subsistence, in uncontrolled and sometimes unhealthy conditions (see Section
 6.d.).
 The old practice of "criadito" service still persists in some parts of the country.
 Criaditos are indigenous children of both sexes, usually 10 to 12 years old, whom
 their parents indenture to middle- and upper-class families to perform household
 work in exchange for education, clothing, room, and board. There are no controls
 over the benefits to, or treatment of, such children, who may become virtual slaves
 for the years of their indenture.
 People With Disabilities.-In 1997 the Government promulgated regulations to im-
 plement the 1995 Law on Disabilities. The regulations require wheelchair access to
 all public and private buildings; duty free import of orthopedic devices; a 50 percent
 reduction in public transportation fares; and expanded teaching of sign language
 and Braille. A National Committee for Incapacitated Persons was established to
 oversee the law's enforcement, conduct studies, and channel and supervise programs
 and donations for the disabled. The new electoral law made arrangements for blind
 voters. In general, however, there are no special services or infrastructure to accom-
 modate people with disabilities. A lack of adequate resources impedes full imple-
 mentation of the new law. Social attitudes keep many disabled persons at home
 from an early age, limiting their integration into society.
 Indigenous People.-Discrimination against, and abuses of, indigenous people con-
 tinued. The indigenous majority generally remains at the low end of the socio-
 economic scale, facing severe disadvantages in health, life expectancy, education, in-
 come, literacy, and employment. More than one-half of all citizens speak indigenous
 dialects as their first language, and many speak no Spanish at all. Lack of edu-
 cation, inefficient farming and mining methods, indigenous cultural practices, and
 societal biases keep the indigenous people poor. They continued to be exploited in
 the workplace. Some rural indigenous workers are kept in a state of virtual slaver
 by employers who charge them more for room and board than they earn. Although
 the 1996 Agrarian Reform Law extended the protection of the national labor law
 to all paid agricultural workers, including indigenous workers, the problem persists
 for lack of effective enforcement.
 The Agrarian Reform Law provides for indigenous communities to have legal title
 to their communal lands and for individual farmers to have title to the land they
 work. The Government and indigenous leaders jointly developed provisions of this
 law. Government authorities presented communal land titles to seven indigenous
 groups in 1997.
 Indigenous people complain that their territories are not legally defined and pro-
 tected, and that outsiders exploit their resources. Specific offenders allegedly are
 coca growers and timber pirates. Indigenous groups have taken advantage of the
 Popular Participation Law to form municipalities that offer them greater opportuni-
 ties for self-determination.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Workers may form and join organizations of their
 choosing. The Labor Code requires prior government authorization to establish a
 union, permits only one union per enterprise, and allows the Government to dissolve
 unions; however, the Government has not enforced these provisions in recent years.
 While the code denies civil servants the right to organize and bans strikes in public
 services, including banks and public markets, nearly all civilian government work-
 ers are unionized. Workers are not penalized for union activities. In theory, the Bo-
 livian Labor Federation (COB) represents virtually the entire work force; however,
 only about one-half of workers in the formal economy actually belong to labor
 unions. Some members of the informal economy also participate in labor or trade
 organizations.
 Workers in the private sector frequently exercise the right to strike. Solidarity
 strikes are illegal, but the Government has neither prosecuted those responsible nor
 imposed penalties. Significant strikes centered around annual negotiations over sal-
 aries and benefits for public employees. However, their real targets were the Gov-
 ernment's economic and social reform programs. Most strikes were conducted and
 led by the militant Trotskyite element of the Urban Teachers Union, which pro-

 tested the Government's education reform plan. The most contentious issue was a
 merit-based salary system. Radical elements of the union clashed with the police in
 demonstrations around the country, and some injuries and arrests resulted. One
 teacher was seriously wounded during the protests. Other disturbances occurred in
 the Chapare region, where the coca growers unions opposed government eradication
 efforts. Dissension within the COB held disruptive public demonstrations to their
 lowest level in recent years.
 Unions are not free from influence by political parties. The COB itself is a politi-
 cal organization directed by Marxist ideologues. Its stated aim is to overthrow the
 Government's neoliberal economic program, and it .'ves little attention to serious
 collective bargaining. Most parties have labor committees that attempt to influence
 union activity and also have party activists inside the unions.
 The law allows unions to join international labor organizations. The COB became
 an affiliate of the Communist, formerly Soviet-dominated, World Federation of
 Trade Unions in 1988.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Workers may organize and
 bargain collectively. Collective bargaining, or voluntary direct negotiations between
 employers and workers without the participation of the government, is limited but
 growing. The Labor Code was written in a period in which the COB, which purports
 to represent all worker groups and interests, had quasi-governmental status and the
 exclusive authority to negotiate with state-owned enterprises. The practice was for
 the COB and the Government to negotiate a global agreement on salaries, minimum
 wages, and other work conditions each year. With the privatization of most of these
 enterprises, the COB's relevancy has diminished markedly, and the practice of di-
 rect employee-management negotiations in individual enterprises is expanding.
 The law prohibits discrimination against union members and organizers. Com-
 plaints go to the National Labor Court, which can take a year or more to rule. The
 court has ruled in favor of discharged workers in some cases and successfully re-
 quired their reinstatement. However, union leaders say problems are often moot by
 the time the court rules.
 Labor law and practice in the seven special duty-free zones are the same as in
 the rest of the country.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The law prohibits forced or com-
 pulsory labor, including forced andbonded labor by children. However, the practices
 of child apprenticeship and agricultural servitude by indigenous workers (see Sec-
 tion 5) constitute violations, as do some individual cases of household workers effec-
 tively held captive by their employers.
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment.-The law
 prohibits employment of persons under 18 years of age in dangerous, unhealthy, or
 immoral work. The Labor Code is ambiguous on conditions of employment for mi-
 nors from 14 to 17 years of age and permits apprenticeship for those 12 to 14 years
 old. This practice, sometimes tantamount to bondage (see Section 6.c.), has been
 criticized by the International Labor Organization. The extreme poverty of many
 families dictates the involuntary employment of their children for motives of sur-
 vival.
 Responsibility for enforcing child labor provisions resides in the Labor Ministry,
 but it generally does not enforce them throughout the country. Although the law re-
 quires all children to complete at least 5 years of primary school, this requirement
 is poorly enforced, particularly in rural areas. Urban children sell goods, shine
 shoes, and assist transport operators. Rural children often work with parents from
 an early age. Children are not generally employed in factories or formal businesses
 but, when employed, often work the same hours as adults.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-In conformity with the law, the minimum wage
 is subject to annual renegotiation and was increased in April by 7.5 percent to ap-
 proximately $54 (300 Bolivianos) per month, plus bonuses and fringe benefits. The
 Congress approved a further 10percent increase on December 18, which was to take
 effect in 1999. The minimum wage does not provide a decent standard of living for
 a worker and family, and most workers earn more. Although the minimum wage
 falls below prevailing wages in most jobs, certain benefit calculations are pegged to
 it. The minimum wage does not cover about 20 percent of urban workers-vendors
 and shoe polishers, for example-nor does it cover farmers, some 30 percent of the
 working population.
 Only one-half of the urban labor force enjoys an S-hour workday and a workweek
 of 5 or 5  days, because the maximum workweek of 44 hours is not enforced. The
 Labor Ministry's Bureau of Occupational Safety has responsibility for protection of
 workers health and safety, but relevant standards are pooriy enforced. Working
 conditions in the mining sector are particularly bad. Although the State Mining Cor-
 poration has an office responsible for safety, many mines, often old and using anti-
 
 
 quated equipment, are dangerous and unhealthy. In some mines operated as co-
 operatives, miners earn less than $3 per 12-hour day. They work without helmets,
 boots, or respirators in mines where toxic gases abound; they buy their own sup-
 plies, including dynamite, have no scheduled rest periods, and must survive under-
 ground from 24 to 72 hours continuously with little water or food. There are no spe-
 cial provisions in law defining when workers may remove themselves from dan-
 gerous situations. Unless the work contract covers this area, any worker who re-
 fuses to work based on the individual's judgment of excessively dangerous conditions
 may face dismissal.
