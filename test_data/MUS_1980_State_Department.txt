 MAURITIUS
 In Mauritius an independent judiciary administers a
 legal system based on Great Britain's with similar
 concern for the rights of the accused. Health and
 social services are free and available to all as is
 most education.
 Three major and several minor political parties vigorously
 compete for the allegiance of voters without government
 interference, except for the postponement, for alleged
 financial reasons, of recent municipal elections. Five
 dailies and two important weeklies as well as several
 other newspapers operate in a highly partisan fashion
 limited only by libel and slander laws.
 The principal opposition party, the Marxist-oriented
 Mauritian Militant Movement, as a result of face-losing
 political and labor dispute defeats in 1979, was much
 less prone in 1980 to utilize illegal confrontational
 strikes and violent demonstrations against the government.
 The government has had to reduce its subsidies for rice,
 the staple food of Mauritius, in the face of inflation,
 International Monetary Fund strictures and cyclone dis-
 asters.
 1.    Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 Any use of torture or inhuman punishment is prohibited
 by law. No credible allegations of torture are known
 to have been made.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 These have not occurred in Mauritius since the country
 became independent in 1968.
 c. Disappearances
 There have been no reported cases of disappearances.
 d. Arbitrary Arrestand Imprisonment
 There are no political prisoners in Mauritius. Arbitrary
 arrests occurred in the early 1970s when the government
 jailed opposition political and trade union leaders
 whom it accused of creating chaos and anarchy. Early
 in 1978 several leading opposition figures were arrested
 and prosecuted under the Public Order Act for blocking a
 public thoroughfare during an unsanctioned demonstration.
 All but one were released after fourteen days in jail.
 The remaining detainee was sentenced to three months in
 prison for advocating the killing of policemen.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 
 
 177
 Mauritius' judicial system is similar to that of Great
 Britain, with rights and procedures virtually identical.
 Since the early 1970's its record of assuring fair public
 trials to all offenders has been excellent.
 f. Invasion of the Home
 The sanctity of the home is guaranteed by law, and
 respected in practice.
 2.    Government Policies Relating to the Fulfillment of Such
 Vital Needd as Food, Shelter, Health Care and Education.
 The country's mixed economy is based on sugar produc-
 tion. Until well into the twentieth century economic power
 was largely in the hands of the small Franco-Hauritian
 sugar aristocracy. Although much economic power is retained
 by this group, the rise of labor unions and a Labor Party
 government have assured a muci more equitable distribution
 of the island's resources. Per capita GNP ($800 plus) in
 Mauritius is quite high for the developing world  Most
 workers except civil servants and high-salaried executives
 either are exempt from taxes or are able to evade payment.
 Taxes are highly progressive.
 The government has sought to provide adequate health
 care, education, food and shelter to the people.
 Government expenditures for community and social
 services (including education, health, social security,
 housing and food subsidies) have increased during the
 past four years by 60 percent and now make up 52
 percent of the annual budget.
 Health care at government hospitals and clinics is free
 for all who cannot pay. Effective family planning
 institutions and government support for population
 limitation have contributed to a decline in the birth
 rate on this densely populated island from 318 percent
 to 216 percent over a period of sixteen years. A
 concommitant reduction in population growth has occurred
 during the same period from 2.17 to 1.7 percent despite
 the fact that life expectancy has almost doubled during
 the past thirty years.
 Virtually all Mauritian children attend school. The
 island's literacy rate is 61 percent. At the beginning
 of 1977 free secondary education was made available to
 all Mauritians, along with training at the University
 of Mauritius (previously, primary education and some
 secondary education was free). Due to a deterioration
 in the economic situation and natural disasters,
 however, the university's budget was cut back necessi-
 tating the reintroduction in 1980 of tuition fees.
 Women in Mauritius are free to participate in all types
 of political, business and social activities, and a few
 hold high positions. Nonetheless, conservative religious
 and ethnic attitudes inhibit women. However, in
 October 1980 the legislative assembly passed a bill
 abolishing most of the legal stipulations discriminat-
 ing against women.
 The government subsidizes the sale of rice and flour.
 Because food imports are a serious drain on the economy,
 
 
 178
 the government has tried to diversify agricultural
 production. The results have not been encouraging.
 The government is also attempting to address the
 serious housing shortage, prodded by opposition criticism,
 but is limited by lack of resources. During 1980 the
 government at the recommendation of the International
 Monetary Fund, substantially reduced its food subsidies.
 3.    Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 Freedom of speech, press, religion and assembly is
 protected. The Public Order Act requires police permis-
 sion for demonstrations and mass meetings. Such permis-
 sion is generally although not always granted. Mauritius
 is a highly political country. Debate on political
 issues in the media and among the citizenry is vigorous.
 In the general elections held in 1976 the present opposi-
 tion party won more seats than any other political party.
 The present government rules through a coalition which
 gives it a majority of only one vote. The term of the
 present parliament will end in December 1981.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emiqration and Repatriation
 There are no restrictions on movement within the country,
 foreign travel or emigration.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Political participation is open to all adult citizens.
 One matter of human rights concern has been the
 indefinite postponement of municipal elections originally
 scheduled for December 1979 or January 1980. Ostensibly,
 the elections were not held because the government
 could not afford them in the tight economic situation.
 However, the opposition, as well as some less partisan
 groups, claim that the elections were not held to prevent
 the opposition from legally taking over all five munici-
 pal administrations in Mauritius.
 Labor unions are free to organize, bargain collectively
 and strike. Indeed, the economy is frequently in turmoil
 because of strikes and slowdowns. The dock workers and
 the sugar workers have been particularly successful in
 obtaining pay increases and improved working conditions.
 4.   Government Attitude and Record Regarding International
 and Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 There are no known requests by outside organizations to
 investigate the human rights situation in Mauritius.
