 ERITREA
 Eritrea became an independent state in May 1993, following a U.N.-supervised
 referendum in which citizens voted overwhelmingly for independence from Ethiopia.
 The Eritrean People's Liberation Front (EPLF), which led the 30-year war for inde-
 pendence, has been in control of the country since it defeated Ethiopian army forces
 in 1991, and its leader, Isaias Afwerki, serves as the President. The EPLF, renamed
 the People's Front for Democracy and Justice (PFDJ), has outlined an ambitious
 program for transition to a democratically elected government by 1997. In April
 1994, the National Assembly, partly appointed by the PFDJ leadership and partly
 elected, created a 50-member National Constitution Commission to draft a constitu-
 tion by mid-1996. The Commission presented a draft to the public in September and
 debate continued through the end of the year. The draft constitution provides for
 democratic freedoms, including the rights of free assembly, free speech, and free as-
 sociation.
 The Government made a sustained effort to reduce the armed forces, over 95,000
 strong by the end of the war for independence, to its current 47,000 strength. The
 police are generally responsible for maintaining internal security, although the Gov-
 ernment may call on the army, the reserves, and demobilized soldiers in times of
 internal disorder. The army is responsible for external and border security. Since
 1993 the army has been forced to deal with the Eritrean Islamic Jihad (EIJ), a
 small, Sudan-based insurgent group that has mounted sporadic terrorist attacks in
 western Eritrea.
 Eritrea underwent a transition from a centrally planned economy introduced by
 the former Ethiopian military dictatorship to a free-market economy introduced
 through the recent privatization of state-owned enterprises and liberalization of in-
 vestment and trade. The economy is largely based on subsistence agriculture, with
 over 70 percent of the population of 3.6 million involved in farming and herding.
 The small industrial sector consists mainly of light industries with outmoded tech-
 nologies. International economic assistance accounts for a significant portion of ex-
 
 
 ternal revenues. The country is extremely poor, with an annual per capita income
 of less than $150.
 The Government continued to enjoy strongpublic support and generally respected
 the rights of its citizens with the exception of Jehovah s Witnesses. Because of their
 refusal to vote or to participate in certain aspects of national service for religious
 reasons, the Government has imposed economic, employment, and travel restrictions
 on all Jehovah's Witnesses. A government proclamation issued in May requires that
 all private and nongovernmental organizations (NGO's) hire those who have com-
 pleted their national service tour, demonstrating the Government's resolve to estab-
 lish a national service program as a legal obligation of all citizens regardless of their
 religious beliefs. The Government has yet to permit prison visits, and an unknown
 number of persons suspected of association with the Ethiopian Mengistu regime,
 radical Islamic elements, or terrorists organizations remain in detention. The unde-
 veloped judicial system limits the provision of speedy trials. There are no domestic
 human rights organizations. Despite the Government's efforts to support rights of
 women, they generally have a lower status than men, and female genital mutilation
 (FGM) remains widespread.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political or other
 extrajudicial killings.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punshment.-
 The Ethiopian Penal Code, as modified by the transitional Penal Code of Eritrea,
 prohibits torture, and there were no reports that the authorities employed it.
 Prison conditions are Spartan but generally not inhuman. The Government does
 not permit prisoners to correspond with family and friends and restricts visitation
 privileges. There were no confirmed reports that prisoners were beaten or may have
 died due to lack of proper medical care. The Government does not permit independ-
 ent monitoring of conditions in detention facilities.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Penal Code stipulates that detainees
 may be held for a maximum of 30 days without being charged with a crime. In prac-
 tice, the authorities sometimes hold persons suspected of crimes for much longer pe-
 riods. In May 1995, on the second anniversary of independence, the Government
 pardoned andreleased 91 detainees who had been held for up to 4 years for collabo-
 ration with the Mengistu regime. An unknown number of additional suspected col-
 laborators remain in detention without charge, despite a statement by President
 Isaias in September 1995 that their cases would be dealt with soon. An unspecified
 number of persons associated with radical Islamic elements or suspected terrorist
 organizations also remained in detention without charge. There were unconfirmed
 reports that the Government arbitrarily detained several Eritrean Liberation Front
 (ELF) members.
 The Government does not use exile as a means of political control.
 e. Denial of a Fair Public Trial.-The judiciary is independent, and there were
 no known incidents of executive interference in the judicial process over the past
 year. The undeveloped judicial system, however, suffers from a lack of trained per-
 sonnel, resources, and infrastructure that in practice limits the State's ability to
 grant accused persons a speedy trial. At independence Eritrea chose to retain the
 Ethiopian legal system based on the Napoleonic Code, until the new constitution is
 promulgated, which is expected in late 1997. Under this Code, simple crimes are
 brought to the lower court and are heard by a single judge. Serious crimes are tried
 publicly by a panel of three judges, and defendants have access to legal counsel,
 usually at their own expense. Although there is no formal public defender's office,
 the Government has successfully requested that attorneys work without fee to rep-
 resent defendants accused of serious crimes who are unable to afford legal counsel.
 Defendants may appeal verdicts to the Appellate Court, which is composed of a
 president and five judges.
 Since the population is largely rural, most citizens only have contact with the
 legal system through traditional courts. Village judges, appointed by a panel of gov-
 ernment magistrates, provide justice in civil matters. Criminal cases are transferred
 to magistrates versed in criminal law. Many local issues, for example, property dis-
 putes and most petty crimes, are adjudicated by local elders according to custom or,
 in the case of Muslims, the Koran. These traditional courts cannot give sentences
 involving physical punishment.
 Crimes committed by members of the military are handled by military courts.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 
 
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-Under
 the law, warrants are required before the Government can monitor mail, telephones,
 or other means of private communication. Warrants also are required in routine
 searches and seizures, except in cases where authorities believe individuals may at-
 tempt to escape or destroy evidence. There is no indication that the Government
 monitored private mail or telephone service.
 The Government may ban any foreign publication from entering the country, and
 the press proclamation forbids the local reprinting of articles from banned publica-
 tions.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press-The draft constitution, when enacted, will pro-
 vide for freedom of speech and of the press, and citizens were generally free to ex-
 press opinions in various forums. The Government controls all media, which include
 three newspapers, one radio station, and one television station. The Government
 continued to restrict the rights of the religious media to comment on politics or gov-
 ernment policies. In theory nonreligious print media are free to criticize the Govern-
 ment. Nonetheless, criticism tends to be limited and fairly mild. Although there is
 no formal censorship body, it is likely that the media practice at least some self-
 censorship.
 The Government's press proclamation allows for individuals to publish news-
 tapers, although there are no privately owned newspapers or magazines published.
 t does not allow for private ownership of any broadcast media. The proclamation
 requires that all newspapers obtain a license from the Ministry of Information be-
 fore publication and that all reporters register with the Ministry. The Government
 may also punish "whosoever insults, abuses, defames, or slanders the Government
 or one of the constituted legislative, executive, or judicial authorities," and forbids
 the publication of any matter that contravenes general morality.
 Once the constitution is ratified, it will become the law of the land and all procla-
 mations that conflict with it will be annulled. The constitutent assembly, once elect-
 ed, is expected to ratify the new constitution by mid-1997.
 Eritrea has one institution of higher education, the University of Asmara. All fac-
 ulty members, including many from outside the country, are accorded full academic
 freedom.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Government requires a
 permit from the Ministry of Internal Affairs for a public meeting or demonstration.
 In general permits are granted freely for nonpolitical meetings or gatherings, and
 although no political demonstrations have occurred, there were no reports that per-
 mits for political demonstrations were denied. The draft constitution states that
 every citizen shall have the right to form organizations for political, social, economic,
 and cultural ends. However, the PFDJ has stated its opposition to the formation of
 religiously or ethnically based parties.
 c. Freedom of- Religion.-Although the draft constitution provides for freedom of
 religion, the Government has banned religious organizations from any involvement
 in politics. A July 1995 proclamation lists specific guidelines on the role of religion
 and religious affiliated NGO's in development and government, stating that develop-
 ment, politics, and public administration are the sole responsibility of the Govern-
 ment and people. As a result, religious organizations may fund, hut not initiate or
 implement development projects. The proclamation also sets out rules governing re-
 lations between religious organizations and foreign sponsors.
 The draft constitution provides for the "freedom to practice any religion and to
 manifest such practice." However, government persecution of the small community
 of Jehovah's Witnesses continued. In October 1994, the Government revoked the
 trading licenses of Jehovah's Witnesses and dismissed those who worked for the
 civil service. This government action resulted in economic difficulties for the Jeho-
 vah's Witnesses, especially former civil servants and businessmen.
 The Witnesses' refusal on religious grounds to participate in national service or
 vote in a referendum applied to all. This spurred widespread criticism that the
 members were collectively shirking their civic duty. The harsh measures for refusal
 to participate in national service were applied only to the Jehovah's Witnesses. In
 addition to the Government's continued denial of passports, Jehovah's Witnesses are
 also denied identification cards, trading licenses, and government housing. However,
 they are not barred from meeting in private homes.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The proposed constitution would provide fully for the rights of move-
 ment and emigration. In general citizens may live where they choose and travel
 freely internally. Some areas are restricted for security reasons. In particular, clash-
 es between government forces and Eritrean Islamic Jihad members have led the
 
 
 88
 Government to restrict travel along much of the border with Sudan. Some areas re-
 main heavily mined, a legacy of the war for independence, leading to additional
 travel restrictions.
 Citizens are largely free to travel outside the country, although the Jehovah's Wit-
 nesses, former ruling party members, those who have not completed national serv-
 ice, and intending emigrants have been denied passports or exit visas and can only
 leave the country by traveling overland to Ethiopia. In general citizens are guaran-
 teed the right to return. Instances in which citizens living abroad have run afoul
 of the law, contracted a serious contagious disease, or been declared ineligible for
 political asylum by other governments are considered on a case-by-case basis. The
 Government cooperates with the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR)
 for the repartiation of Eritrean refugees from Sudan. A pilot refugee return program
 resulted in the successful repatriation of 25,000 refugees from Sudan in 1995. A fur-
 ther 100,000 of the estimated 150,000 to 300,000 Eritrean refugees remaining in
 Sudan have been unable to participate in a UNHCR-sponsored orgrzed repatri-
 ation because of the failure of the Governments of Eritrea and Su an to conclude
 an agreement on modalities of such a repatriation.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens do not currently enjoy this right, and credible reports suggest that au-
 thority within the Government is very narrowly held. The transitional government
 is dominated by the PFDJ.
 The National Assembly in 1994 created a 50-member National Constitution Com-
 mission to draft a democratic constitution. The Commission completed a draft in
 July, and planned a series of public debates with presentation of a final draft to
 the National Assembly by year's end. The Constitution Commission also planned to
 finalish drafting election laws. Elections for the constituent assembly are scheduled
 to take place by late 1997 or early 1998. Ratification of the constitution is expected
 to take place soon thereafter with elections for a new National Assembly by late
 1997 or early 1998.
 In an effort to encourage broader participation by women in politics, the PFDJ
 named 3 women to the party's executive council and 12 women to the Central Com-
 mittee. Women occupy seats on the Constitutional Commission and in the National
 Assembly and hold senior government positions, including the ministerial portfolios
 of justice and tourism. As part of a draft plan to establish regional legislatures, 30
 percent of legislative seats would be reserved for women, who would also be able
 to compete for remaining seats.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Internal Affairs are jointly
 responsible for handling human rights inquiries. All NGO's also must register with
 the Eritrean Relief and Refugee Commission. There are no domestic human rights
 organizations in Eritrea. The Government reported no applications or registrations
 of human rights NGO's during the past year.
 In 1995 the Government proclaimed that religious organizations, including reli-
 gious-based NGO's, could not engage in development activities. The Government
 also removed religious-based indigenous NGO's completely from relief work in order
 to prevent the development of church-based organizations receiving money from
 abroad. All foreign NGO's are considered to be providing technical advice. If they
 are in Eritrea for more than 183 days, NGO's must pay an income tax of 38 percent
 of their salaries and allowances. This tax situation encourages the departure of
 NGO's and the loss of technical assistance.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Transitional Civil Code prohibits discrimination against women, children, and
 people with disabilities.
 Women.-The Government has publicly taken a firm stand against domestic vio-
 lence; health, police and judicial authorities say that no serious domestic violence
 problem exits.
 The Government consistently advocated improving the status of women, many of
 whom played a significant role as fighters in the struggle for independence. In 1991
 the provisional EPLF Government codified a brad range of rights for women, pro-
 viding for equal educational opportunities, equal pay fur equal work, and legal sanc-
 tions aginst domestic violence. In 1994 the Third Party Congress advocated more
 rights or women, including parity in the right to the use of land and other property.
 However, much of society remains traditional and patriarchal, and most women
 
 
 have an inferior status to men in their homes and communities. The law provides
 a framework for improving the status of women, but laws are unevenly imple-
 mented, because of both a lack of capacity in the legal system and ingrained cul-
 tural attitudes. In practice, males retain privileged access to education, employment,
 and control of economic resources, with disparities greater in rural areas than in
 cities.
 Women aged 18 to 40 participate, by law, in the National Service Program.
 Children.-The Ministry of Labor and Human Welfare is responsible for govern-
 ment policies concerning the rights and welfare of children. The Government re-
 cently reorganized and created under the Ministry of Social Affairs a department
 which includes the Children's Affairs Division. The Children's Affairs Division cov-
 ers child care, counseling, and probation. Due to a shortage of schools and teachers,
 half the country's children are unable to attend school.
 Female genital mutilation, which is widely considered by international health ex-
 perts as damaging to bth physical and psychological health, is practiced extensively
 on girls at an early age. The Government, through the Ministry of Health and the
 National Union of Eritrean Women, actively discourages this practice.
 People With Disabilities.-The long war for independence left thousands of men
 and women physically disabled from injuries they received as guerrillas and as civil-
 ian victims. The Government spends a large share of its resources to support and
 train these war disabled, who are regarded as heroes, and does not discriminate
 against them in training, education, or employment. There are no laws mandating
 access for the disabled to public thoroughfares or public or private buildings.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-here are no government restrictions regarding the
 formation of unions, including in the military, the police, and other essential serv-
 ices. Labor association is encouraged by the Government, which promulgated Procla-
 mation 8 in 1991 providing workers with the legal right to form unions and to strike
 to protect their interests. The Government is presently rewriting the labor code, but
 it must wait until the new constitution is ratified. The National Confederation of
 Eritrean Workers, which was part of the EPLF during the war, has reorganized
 since independence and become independent of both the Government and the PFDJ.
 It represents over 20,000 workers from 129 unions. The largest union is the Textile,
 Leather, and Shoe Federation.
 There were no strikes reported in 1996.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Eritrea is a member of the
 International Labor Organization (ILO) and worked closely with the organization in
 1993 to prepare the draft labor code, which prohibits antiunion discrimination by
 employers and establishes a mechanism for resolving complaints of discrimination.
 The Government has indicated its intention to ratify several key ILO conventions
 on labor-freedom of association, the right to bargain, a labor administration sys-
 tem, and prohibitions against child labor-but still has not done so. The Ministry
 of Labor and Human Welfare indicated that ratification of the conventions may not
 occur until after the new constitution is promulgated. Wages are determined by the
 market.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-There is no law or signed conven-
 tion prohibiting compulsory labor. There were no known instances of forced labor.
 All citizens between 18 and 40 are required to participate in the national service
 program, which includes military training as well as civic action programs. High
 school students are also required to participate in a summer work program, for
 which they are paid.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The legal minimum age for em-
 ployment is 18 years, although apprentices may be hired at age 16. While the Min-
 istry of Labor and Human Welfare is responsible for enforcement of laws pertaining
 to employment of children, there is no inspection system in place to monitor compli-
 ance. According to labor officials, 50 percent of children are not able to attend school
 due to a shortage of schools and teachers. Rural children who do not attend classes
 often work on their family farms, while urban children are often street vendors of
 cigarettes, newspapers, or chewing gum.
 e. Acceptable Conditions for Work.-There are two systems regulating employment
 conditions: The civil service system, and the labor law system. There is no legally
 mandated minimum wage in the private sector. In the civil service sector wages
 vary from $40 to $473 (250-3000 birr per month), with factory workers (in Govern-
 ment-owned enterprises) earning the highest wages. The minimum wage does not
 provide the average worker and family a decent standard of living.
 
 
 90
 The standard workweek is 48 hours, but many people work fewer hours. There
 is no legal prevision for a day of rest, but most workers are allowed 1 to 1 la.2 days
 off per week. The Government has instituted occupational health and safety stand-
 ards, but inspection and enforcement vary widely among factories. The draft labor
 law includes a number of previsions concerning women, including one that states
 that women during pregnancy shall not be assigned to jobs that could endanger
 their lives or the lives of their unborn children. Workers are permitted to remove
 themselves from dangerous work sites without retaliation.
