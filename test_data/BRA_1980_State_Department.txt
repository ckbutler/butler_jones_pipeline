 BRAZIL
 During his second year in office, President
 Joao Figueiredo continued to pursue the political
 liberalization process which has provided for human
 rights advances in Brazil in the past few years. A
 constitutional amendment to restore direct election
 of state governors and all senators was enacted in
 1980. In addition, the 1979 amnesty measure continued
 to be implemented so that the last remaining Brazilians
 imprisoned for political offenses were released.
 Underscoring its continued commitment to the political
 opening, the Figueiredo administration tolerated higher
 levels of public criticism of government (though a
 few critics were taken to court on defamation grounds).
 Some reports of police abuse of common criminals and
 suspects persisted in state and local jurisdictions,
 although there were fewer than in previous years.
 Such abuse is officially condemned and absent at the
 federal level.
 The period also provided evidence that the future
 course of liberalization may not always be smooth.
 Continued serious economic problems, notably inflation
 and income level disparities, raised anew concerns
 in some quarters that expanded political and civil
 expression could encourage dissident movements to
 take advantage of latent social tensions. Such concerns
 were underlined early in the year when labor unrest
 in the key Sao Paulo industrial area caused friction
 between labor and government and between government
 and the Catholic Church. During the summer, the nation
 experienced its first serious political violence in
 recent years in the form of bombings widely attributed
 to opponents of liberalization.
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person,
 Including Freedom from:
 a.   Torture
 Torture is prohibited by Articles 122, 129, 136, and
 148 of the Penal Code, all of which deal with physical
 mistreatment and bodily harm, and has been condemned
 by the Brazilian government. There have been no recent
 allegations of torture by federal authorities. Such
 allegations are still made occasionally against local
 police.
 b.   Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 There are no summary executions and Brazilian law
 prohibits capital punishment during peacetime. There
 is no corporal punishment for crimes. As noted above,
 some local police are alleged to have physically
 
 
 359
 abused prisoners and criminal suspects. Such practices
 are not officially condoned. Detention facilities
 are overcrowded, and the level of prison health care,
 diet, and sanitation is low. Officialp point out
 that, as with other social services, the country lacks
 resources to upgrade detention facilities. There
 are no legal distinctions in treatment of prisoners
 based on type of offense, class, or sex.
 c.   Disappearances
 Abduction, secret arrest, and clandestine detention
 do not occur. There have been no allegations of
 "disappearances" of Brazilians during 1980.
 d.   Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 Habeas corpus is constitutionally guaranteed and usually
 respected in practice. Courts are required to rule
 immediately on habeas corpus petitions. Brazilian
 law permits preventive detention in certain well-defined
 instances. In cases of offenses against the National
 Security Law, the accused may be kept in custody for
 30 days, renewable for a like period if authorized
 by competent judicial authority. Cases of persons
 being arrested and illegally held without charge are
 occasionally reported in the press. In the event
 of arrest, the law provides for immediate notification
 of a judicial authority who must then determine legality
 of the arrest, set bail (if the offense permits it),
 and hear habeas corpus petitions.
 e.   Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Brazilian law entitles an accused person to a fair
 public trial. Trial by a single judge is the general
 practice, with jury trial required in cases of willful
 crimes against life. Defendants are entitled to counsel,
 which, if necessary, will be provided by the state.
 Brazilian law requires that defendants be made fully
 aware of. the charges against them, and defendants
 and their lawyers are legally entitled to be informed
 of the evidence on which the charges are based.
 The Brazilian judicial system is constitutionally
 an independent branch of government. The judicial
 system provides for a range of specialized courts
 to deal with specific types of activity --i.e., criminal,
 civil, electoral, family, and labor. The military
 court system, which is part of the judicial rather
 than executive branch, hears cases involving persons
 charged with offenses against the National Security
 Law or military institutions.
 f.   Invasion of the Home
 The Brazilian constitution provides for the
 inviolability of the home. No authority can legally
 enter a home without a warrant, except when it is
 
 
 360
 believed that a crime is being committed or an accident
 has taken place. The Brazilian press has occasionally
 reported instances of illegal police entry.
 Section 2. Government Policies Relating to the
 Fulfillment of such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter,
 Health Care and Education
 Current Economic Conditions and Vital Needs
 After a decade of impressively high growth rates,
 the Brazilian economy is in a period of adjustment.
 From an average annual GDP growth rate of 11.5 percent
 during the pre-OPEC oil crisis period (1970-74), growth
 fell to an average of 6.3 percent in the subsequent
 period. Real GDP growth is expected to be over seven
 percent in 1980. Per capita GDP increased in real
 terms from $1,452 in 1977 to $1,738 in 1979, placing
 Brazil in the group of middle-income countries.
 The economy faced several difficult problems in 1980.
 Inflation climbed from 77 percent at the end of 1979
 to a yearly rate of over 100 percent in the second
 half of 1980, despite government efforts to stabilize
 the economy through spending cuts, price and credit
 controls, and reduced private sector investment.
 The trade deficit, aggravated by the country's heavy
 dependence on imported oil, is expected tb be over
 $2.5 billion for the year. While the volume of oil
 imports has been contained, OPEC price increases have
 thwarted government attempts to balance the trade
 account and halt the growth of inflation. Brazil's
 mounting foreign debt is estimated to be more than
 $55 billion. Debt service payments and oil import
 costs will exceed Brazil's expected 1980 export earnings
 of more than $20 billion.
 Seventy percent of Brazil's population lives within
 100 kilometers of the coast. Rural-to-urban migration
 is concentrating population increases in the cities,
 where basic economic needs are more adequately met.
 Preliminary 1980 census data indicate that the annual
 population growth rate for the past decade has been
 2.4 percent, compared with 2.9 percent for the 1960-
 70 decade. Population growth and migration have complicated
 the government's ability to keep up with the expanded
 need for public health and social services.
 Income distribution is a serious domestic social problem,
 even though evidence suggests that nearly all social
 strata have benefitted absolutely from the country's
 economic growth. According to government statistics,
 between 1960 and 1976 the concentration of income
 in the richest 10 percent of the population increased
 from 39.6 to 59.4 percent, while the share received
 by the poorest 50 percent fell from 17.4 to 13.5 percent.
 Regional income differences are marked, with the South-
 Southeast--containing slightly more than 50 percent
 of the population--earning 82 percent of the income.
 Life expectancy is officially estimated at 60 years.
 Nationally, infant mortality is 109 per 1,000 live
 births, but there are widespread regional differences.
 Health personnel and health facilities are concentrated
 in urban areas and the industrial Southeast, which
 accounts for 80 percent of the physicians, 73 percent
 of the nursing personnel and 79 percent of the hospital
 beds. The government is attempting to improve safety
 and health conditions in the work place.
 
 
 361
 Significant portions of the society lack some vital
 needs--nutrition, potable water, basic education,
 and medical care. Illustrative of this are the findings
 of a recent Brazilian congressional inquiry which
 found that Brazil has two million abandoned children
 and 18 million children without the basic necessities
 of life.
 Adult literacy was officially estimated in 1979 at
 72 percent (although some Brazilian educators believe
 this figure to be high). There were 43 children of
 school age per available teacher.
 The right to hold and sell private property is a
 fundamental principle. According to government figures,
 the concentration of landholding intensified between
 1972 and 1976, due principally to the extension of
 agribusiness and the incorporation of ranches and
 farms. In 1972 there were 3.4 million registered
 rural properties on land classified as arable, totalling
 370 million hectares. Individual properties with
 over 1,000 hectares represented 1.5 percent of all
 properties, but 51.4 percent of the total area. In
 1976 total properties had increased to 3.84 million
 units and 464 million hectares. The number of properties
 with over 1,000 hectares increased to 1.7 percent
 of all properties and accounted for 55.3 percent of
 total land area.
 In the course of Brazil's rapid though uneven economic
 development, women have made major strides in attaining
 equal status. Basic legal rights are guaranteed without
 regard to sex. In Brazil's relatively affluent, economically
 and politically dynamic urban areas, women are becoming
 increasingly active in the professions, industry,
 education, the arts, and media as well as political
 life, including a small representation in the National
 Congress. This level and this range of activities
 are much less in evidence in the rural, economically
 underdeveloped sectors of the country, and especially
 in the Northeast where poverty and traditional attitudes
 constitute obstacles. Although a legal requirement,
 equal pay for equal work is not widely practiced.
 During the year considerable public attention was
 focused on the question of abuse of women by their
 husbands, a violation which women's rights advocates
 claim has long gone unpunished and unrecognized in
 Brazil.
 Government Policies Relating to Vital Needs
 The Figueiredo administration issued the following
 general policy declaration in 1979 concerning its
 goal of improving Brazilian living standards: *It
 behooves the government to create conditions whereby
 citizens can realize, without prejudice or discrimination,
 their hopes for health, well-being, housing, education,
 employment opportunities at remunerative wages, plus
 social services provided by the government.' Among
 the "inescapableO objectives which the document set
 forth were reducing economic inequality through progressive
 taxation, improving the lot of disadvantaged regions
 by tax and credit incentives, and continuation--and
 expansion if possible--of public health programs.
 
 
 362
 Expenditures for education and culture, housing, health
 and sanitation, and welfare increased from 18.9 percent
 of the government budget in 1975 to 19.4 percent in
 1980. By contrast, military expenditures for the
 1976-79 period averaged only 9.5 percent of the government
 budget.
 While the government is committed to improving living
 standards, the Figueiredo administration has made
 clear that its immediate priorities are raising agricultural.
 production and reducing inflation. The government
 has also indicated that fulfillment of economic and
 social objectives will be dependent, over the medium
 term, on resolving the balance of payments and energy
 problems. Faced with these pressing economic problems,
 the government is finding it more difficult than in
 previous years to make progress in the fulfillment
 of vital needs.
 The country's estimated 200,000 Indians have suffered
 in recent decades from the gradual encroachment of
 Brazil's coastal-based population and from the government's
 efforts to promote economic development in the Amazon
 region and frontier areas where most Indians live.
 The increasing contact between Indians and newcomers
 has bred occasional conflict. The Figueiredo administration
 has renewed the government's commitment under the
 1973 Indian Statute to protect the Indian population,
 and the government's Indian affairs agency (FUNAI)
 has been charged under the law with the task of demarcating
 tribal lands, which would provide a greater measure
 of security for the Indians. In the face of more
 immediate priorities, however, FUNAI has remained
 an understaffed agency and the demarcation has not
 been completed on schedule.
 Section 3. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties,
 Including:
 a.   Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 The government guarantees (with minor qualifications
 discussed below) all these civil liberties which are,
 in turn, widely exercised. There continues to be
 broad acceptance on the part of the administration
 of public protest and dissent. There are no limitations
 on assemblies as long as these are not seen to threaten
 public order. Even illegal organizations such as
 the Brazilian Communist Party and the National Union
 of Students have been allowed to assemble and organize.
 Occasionally, public protests have led to skirmishes
 with security forces.
 Opposition viewpoints are freely ventilated. In the
 media there is public discussion and criticism of
 official policies and of the performance of
 administration officials from the President on down.
 In the so-called alternative (mainly leftist) press,
 this criticism is often scathing and highly personal.
 During the past year, legal action was brought against
 two federal Congressmen as a result of the latters'
 allegedly libelous criticism of the President and
 the military establishment. The cases are currently
 before the Supreme Court.
 
 
 363
 While no censorship exists, the print media are legally
 accountable for what they publish. The administration
 took action several times during the year against
 what it considered unacceptably blatant attacks, confiscating
 one edition of a leftist weekly and bringing lawsuits
 in a half-dozen other instances. Radio and TV exercise
 some internal controls on their programming to avoid
 potential conflicts over content. There are few inhibitions
 on these media, however, and programming includes
 frequent comment on controversial social and political
 topics. There has been no government harassment or
 closing of the media. There is no censorship of books,
 although there have been some official moves to restrict
 the distribution of publications judged to be pornographic.
 There has been no reported interference with academic
 inquiry in the natural or social sciences or persecution
 of professional groups.
 Labor unions have the effective right to organize,
 negotiate, and strike. However, strikes are not permitted
 in essential industries (which have been broadly defined),
 and union rights are generally circumscribed by a
 ban on partisan political activity. Organized labor
 was increasingly active in 1980, including more effective
 collective bargaining and more frequent use of the
 strike weapon. The government demonstrated general
 tolerance toward union activism, even when in excess
 of formal legal limits. However, the government intervened
 in the Sao Paulo metalworkers' strike in April-May
 1980 and removed key union leaders from office on
 the grounds that the strike was being used .for political
 purposes.
 Practice of religion is freely permitted. There is
 no state religion. Minority religions are not persecuted
 or harassed; adherence to a particular faith does
 not confer advantage or disadvantage in secular areas.
 b.   Freedom of Movement Within the Country,
 Foreign Travel, Emigration and Repatriation
 There are no restrictions on movement within the country
 or on emigration or repatriation, nor are women or
 other groups subject to separate provisions in these
 areas.
 Brazil applies a selective refugee policy, based essentially
 on geographical proximity, cultural affinity, and
 the nation's ability to absorb newcomers.  (Brazil
 has slowed overall immigration to a trickle after
 years of a much more liberal policy.) Hence, Brazil
 accepts primarily Southern Cone (Argentina, Chile,
 Uruguay) refugees. It accepted for resettlement 35
 Cubans who participated in the recent exodus and who
 requested to go to Brazil. It received a hundred
 or so Vietnamese "boat people" who had been picked
 up by Brazilian vessels. A "foreigners" law enacted
 in 1980 reportedly raised some concerns among refugees
 
 
 364
 and expatriates that their status will be jeopardized.
 The Church, too, expressed concern over the application
 of this law when a foreign priest was expelled from
 the country under its provisions in October. However,
 the government has announced that it is considering
 amendments to the text.
 Brazilian law provides for political asylum but is
 not precise on criteria. In practice, Brazil has
 been generally selective in granting asylum.
 C.   Freedom to Participate in the Political
 Process
 The Congress approved in November an administration-
 sponsored constitutional amendment restoring direct
 gubernatorial elections and making all future Senate
 elections direct. Municipal legislatures are popularly
 elected, as are mayors, except those in state capitals
 and "strategically located" cities who are appointed
 by state governors. Municipal elections scheduled
 for 1980 were postponed by the Congress for two years
 on the grounds that organization of new parties had
 made it impossible to meet the original electoral
 timetable. The opposition depicted this as a step
 away from the recent reforms in the electoral and
 other areas, although the Figueiredo administration
 reiterated its commitment to continuing the liberalization
 process.
 Citizens are free to participate in government through
 suffrage, political party affiliation, membership
 in interest groups, direct approach to office holders,
 -etc. All of these means are openly available; use
 of them varies with educational level, interest, physical
 proximity, and other factors. Voting is secret and
 mandatory for adult literates; illiterates cannot
 vote. Opposition parties and groups, except for the
 Communist Party, operate freely and participate fully
 in the political process. Problems of nationality,
 statelessness, etc., are not significant factors.
 4.   Government Attitude and Record Regarding International
 and Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged
 Violations of Human Rights
 Although the Brazilian government considers
 international and third-country investigation into
 alleged human rights violations as unwarranted
 interference in Brazil's internal affairs, the federal
 government has not impeded visits by representatives
 of such organizations in recent years. No such visits
 to investigate alleged violations in Brazil are known
 to have taken place in 1980.
 Non-governmental Brazilian organizations, such as
 the National Conference of Brazilian (Catholic)
 Bishops (CNBB), the national Brazilian Bar
 Association (OAB) and its local chapters, the
 Brazilian Press Association, and local lay and
 Church-sponsored justice and peace groups,
 investigate and publicize alleged human rights
 
 
 365
 violations or institute legal proceedings to
 redress them. As a possible consequence of this
 activity, some of these organizations - notably
 the OAB - or individuals working for them have been
 targets of recent politically motivated violence.
 Brazil is a party to a number of UN human rights
 conventions including the conventions on genocide,
 racial discrimination, refugees, and the political
 rights of married women. Brazil has not signed the
 Inter-American Convention on Human Rights.
