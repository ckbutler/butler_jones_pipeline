 AUSTRALIA
 Australia has a federal system of government and a long history as a multiparty
 parliamentary democracy. The judiciary is independent.
 Federal, state, and local police are under the firm control of civilian authorities
 and carry out their functions in accordance with the law.
 A highly developed economy, which includes manufacturing, mining, agriculture,
 and services, provides most people with a high per capita income. A wide range of
 government programs offers assistance for the minority of relatively disavantaged
 citizens.
 Laws provide for basic human rights; the Government respects and enforces these
 laws. The Government administers many programs to improve the socioeconomic
 conditions of Aboriginals and Torres Straits Is anders, who together form about 2
 percent of the population, and to address longstanding discrimination against them.
 A national study documented credible allegations that police have used excessive
 force against juvenile aborigine detainees. Societal discrimination and violence
 against women are problems, which, however, are being actively addressed.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extra judicial KIling.-There were no reports of political or
 other extrajudicial killings.
 According to a February Australian Institute of Criminology report, there was a
 12 percent increase (74 deaths in 1993 versus 83 in 1994) in total deaths in police
 and prison custody during the 12-month period ending in June 1994. The number
 of Aboriginal deaths in custody increased from 7 to 11. The same report shows that
 non-aborigine deaths in custody increased from 49 to 51. The incidence of deaths
 per 1,000 prisoners was 4.44 for aborigine detainees versus 3.65 for non-aborigine
 detainees.
 In the state of Victoria, at least eight people in 1995 were shot dead by police.
 There have been allegations in the print media and among human rights groups of
 pervasive police use of excessive force in the apprehension of suspects. Four sepa-
 rate investigations into the shootings were carried out by the state government and
 the police. These recommended a vigorous plan of action, including additional train-
 ing techniques in nonviolent apprehension, and new equipment for police officers.
 In all, there were 22 fatal police shootings in Victoria between 1988 and 1995, 5
 of which involved people with histories of mental illnss.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment-
 The law prohibits all such practices, and there were no reports that officials em-
 ployed them.
 rion onditions meet international standards and the Government permits vis-
 its by human rights monitors.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The law prohibits arbitrary arrest, deten-
 tion, or exile, and the Government observes this prohibition in practice.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution provides for an independent judi-
 ciary, and the executive and legislative branches respect its provisions.
 There is a well-developed system of federal and state courts, with the High Court
 at its apex. Almost all criminal trials are conducted by courts established under
 state and territorial legislation. The Federal Court and the High Court have very
 limited roles to play. When trials are conducted in local courts, the magistrates sit
 alone. In the higher courts, namely the state district or county courts and the state
 or territory supreme courts, trials are usually conducted by judge and jury. The jury
 decides on the facts and verdict after a trial conducted by a judge.

 The law provides for the right to a fair trial, and the judiciary vigorously enforces
 this right.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The law
 prohibits such practices. The authorities generally respect these prohibitions, and
 violations are subject to effective legal sanction.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-There is no bill of rights. In two decisions, the
 High Court indicated that freedom of political discourse is implied in the Constitu-
 tion. The Government respects these rights in practice. An independent press, an
 effective judiciary, and a functioning democratic political system combine to ensure
 freedom of speech and of the press, including academic freedom.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-Although these freedoms are
 not codified in law, citizens exercise them without government restriction.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-Citizens have complete freedom of religion. A provision
 of the Constitution precludes the adoption of a state religion.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The law provides for these rights, and the Government respects them
 in practice. The Government cooperates with the U.N. High Commissioner for Refu-
 gees and other humanitarian organizations in assisting refugees. The Government
 has continued to forcibly repatriate persons who it has determined do not have a
 valid claim to refugee status. Private human rights and refugee lobby groups main-
 tain that the Government's refugee and asylum adjudication process is applied in-
 consistently.
 Under the Migration Reform Act of 1992, asylum seekers who arrived at the bor-
 der without prior authorization to enter the country were automatically detained.
 In November and December 1994, there was a dramatic, but temporary, increase
 in the numbers of asylum seekers arriving by boat, mostly from southern China,
 bringing the annual total to 952. The majority of asylum seekers were detained for
 the duration of the often-prolonged asylum process. The detention policy has been
 an intractable issue. The policy has led to extensive litigation initiated by human
 rights and refugee lobbies charging that the lengthy detentions (in some instances
 involving children and lasting several years) violate the human rights of the refu-
 gees. In September the Government's Human Rights Commissioner, Chris Sidoti,
 initiated an investigation of alleged human rights violations arising from the pro-
 longed detention.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The Constitution provides citizens with the right to change their government
 peacefully, and citizens exercise this right in practice through periodic, free, and fair
 elections held on the basis of universal suffrage.
 No legal impediments exist to prevent women and indigenous people from holding
 public office. However, historical patterns of bias against women and the deleterious
 effects of poor educational achievement and a generally inferior socioeconomic status
 for indigenous people have contributed to their underrepresentation among political
 leaders. Approximately 14 percent of Members of Parliament (M.P.'s) are women.
 There are no Aboriginals serving as M.P.'s. The Government and the opposition
 have both declared their intent to increase the number of women elected to public
 office, but little progess has been made since these declarations.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 A wide variety of human rights groups operate without government restriction
 (and in some instances with government funding), investigating and publishing
 their findings on human rights cases. Government officials are very cooperative and
 responsive to their views.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The law prohibits discrimination based on the above listed factors, and the Gov-
 ernment and an independent judiciary vigorously enforce the prohibition.
 Women.-Social analysts and commentators estimate that domestic violence may
 affect as many as one family in three or four. Government statisticians stress that,
 because of underreporting and the lack of an agreed method for collecting statistics,
 it is impossible to provide an accurate national profile of the number of women who
 are victims of domestic violence. The Government is in the last tranche of a well-
 
 
 received national 3-year community education campaign about domestic violence
 and the legal recourse available to victims.
 Women have equal status under the law, and the law provides for pay equity.
 There are highly organised and effective private and public women's rights
 organisations at the federal, state and local levels. There is a federal-level Office of
 the Status of Women which monitors women's rights. The Federal Sex Discrimina-
 tion Commissioner receives complaints and attempts to resolve those that are
 deemed valid. A 1994 U.N. report estimated that women receive approximately 90
 percent of wages paid to men ior substantially similar work.
 A government-funded advisory body reported in 1994 that women face systemic
 discrimination within the legal system. The report indicated that discrimination
 ag"aint women permeates law, judicial interpretation, and women's access to legal
 services.
 Children.-The Government demonstrates its strong commitment to children's
 rights and welfare through its well-funded systems of public education and medical
 care. There is no pattern of societal abuse against children. The Federal Human
 Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission receives complaints and attempts to re-
 solve those it finds valid. Similarily, the six states and two territories investigate
 complaints of neglect or child abuse and institute practical measures aimed at pro-
 tecting the child when such complaints prove founded.
 People With Disabilities.-The Government has enacted legislation which pro-
 hibits discrimination against disabled persons in employment, education, or other
 state services. The Disability Discrimination Commissioner promotes compliance
 with federal laws prohibiting discrimination against disabled persons. The Commis-
 sioner also promotes more energetic implementation and enforcement of state laws
 that protect the rights of disabled persons.
 State and territory governments have not enacted legislation mandating the pro-
 vision of accessibility or the disabled. It is lawful to deny employment or services
 to those with disabilities if there are reasonable grounds for believing that the dis-
 abled person would be unable to carry out the work or would require the employer
 or service provider to furnish services or facilities which could not reasonably be
 supplied. State and territory courts have upheld or dismissed suits brought by dis-
 abled plaintiffs on a case-by-case basis. Attempts by physically impaired people to
 use antidiscrimination legislation in broader battles have not been successful to
 date.
 Indigenous People.-The Racial Discrimination Act of 1975 prohibits discrimina-
 tion on grounds of race, color, descent, or national or ethnic origin. The Ministry
 for Aboriginal Affairs, in conjunction with the Aboriginal and Torres Straits Islander
 Commission (ATSIC), has the main responsibility for initiatin  coordinating, and
 monitoring all governmental efforts to improve the quality of lie of indigenous peo-
 ples. A wide variety of government initiatives and programs seek to improve all as-
 pects of Aboriginal and Torres Straits Islander life.
 In practice, however, indigenous Australians continue to experience significantly
 higher rates of imprisonment, inferior access to medical and educational services,
 greatly redued ife-expectancy rates, elevated levels of unemployment, and general
 dcrimination which ontribute to an overwhelming feeing, ofdisenfranchisement.
 Indigenous people are imprisoned 16 times more than nonindigenous people. Over
 45 percent of aborigin e men between the ages of 20 and 30 have been arrested at
 some time in their 'ives. The prison representation rate for indigenous juvenile of-
 fenders is almost 20 times that of nonindigenous juveniles. Indigenous groups claim
 that the Government's lack of response to a series of recommendations by the 1991
 Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody contributes to these disturbing
 statistics. The Government acknowledges that socioeconomic conditions give rise to
 the common precursors of indigenous crime, e.g., unemployment, homelessness, and
 boredom.
 Police harassment of indigenous people and racial discrimination by police and
 prison custodians persists. A 1994 University of Melbourne study of 171 aborigine
 juveniles in custody stated that 85 percent reported beinghit, punched, kicke  or
 slapped by police. Preliminary data suggest that the problem highlighted by the
 1994 study continued in 1995. Most of the juveniles interviewed had complaints con-
 cerning violence occurring after apprehension and during questioning about alleged
 offenses. Government statistics have confirmed the common perception among indig-
 enous people that they are systematically ill-treated by police. Government reports
 have suggested that the pursuit of economic self-determination for indigenous peo-
 ple will greatly assist in solving the crime problems in indigenous communities and
 the inequities in rates of imprisonment.
 The average life expectancy of an indigenous person is 20 years less than that
 of a nonindigenous person. The infant mortality rate for indigenous children is three
 
 
 times that of nonindigenous children. The maternal mortality rate for indigenous
 women is five times that of nonindigenous women. The incidence of illnesses such
 as tuberculosis, leprosy, hepatitis, and of sexually transmitted diseases is 10 times
 greater among indigenous people.
 A national survey indicated that 22.5 percent of indigenous children complete sec-
 ondary education versus 76.2 percent of nonindigenous children. Only 7 percent of
 Aboriginals pursue postsecondary education.
 The Government has initiated progr sn, including a 1 billion Australian dollar
 (US$750 million) Indigenous Land Fund and a Federal Social Justice Package,
 aimed at ameliorating the challenges faced by indigenous Australians. The Govern-
 ment is also seeking ways to improve upon 1993 Native Title Legislation which has
 been largely unsuccesful in assisting aborigines to establish and pursue title to land.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right ofAssociation.-Australian law and practice provide workers, includ-
 ing public servants, freedom of association domestically and internationally. Ap-
 proximately 35 percent of the work force is unionized. Although unions carry out
 their internal functions free from government or political control, most local affili-
 ates belong to state branches of the Australian Labor Party (ALP). Union members
 must make up at least 50 percent of the delegates to ALP congresses, but unions
 do not participate or vote as a bloc.
 There are no restrictions on the right to strike. Legislation which went into force
 on March 30, 1994 for the first time legalized what had always been a de facto right
 to strike.
 Laws and regulations prohibit retribution against strikers and labor leaders, and
 they are effectively enforced. In practice, employers tend to avoid legal remedies
 (e.g., secondary boycott injunctions) available to them in order to preserve a long-
 term relationship with their unions.
 Since 1992 the federal Labor Government has used its adherence to International
 Labor Organization (ILO) conventions to override state objections to new labor rela-
 tions legislation. Recent major provisions (right to strike, parental leave, pay equity,
 minimum wage, and protection from unfair dismissals and hiring discrimination)
 were deliberately based on ILO conventions and recommendations, as well as on
 broader international conventions and covenants.
 Unions may freely form and join federations or confederations, and they actively
 participate in international bodies.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Australian law and practice
 provide workers with the right to organize and bargain collectively, and the law pro-
 tects them from antiunion discrimination.
 Federal and state governments administer centralized, minimum-wage awards
 and provide quasi-judicial arbitration, supplemented by industrywide or company-
 by-company collective bargaining.
 Government legislation has aimed to facilitate decentralized collective bargaining,
 keyed to individual enterprises, in order to relate wage increases more directly to
 gains in productivity. Workers can trade fringe benefits for greater wage increases,
 but must register their agement with the Australian Industrial Relations Commis-
 sion (AIRC), which insures that they suffer no net disadvantage. The legislation also
 created an industrial relations court to adjudicate disputes, especially the failure to
 bargain in good faith, arising from the increased use of enterpnse bargaining.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Although there are no laws pro-
 hibiting it, forced labor is not practiced.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-There is no federally mandated
 minimum age for employment, but state-imposed compulsory education require-
 ments, monitored and enforced by state educational authorities, effectively prevent
 most children from joining the work force until they are 15 or 16 years of age. Fed-
 eral and state governments monitor and enforce a network of laws, which vary from
 state to state, governing the minimum school-leaving age, the minimum age to claim
 unemployment benefits, and the minimum age to engage in specified occupations.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-Although a formal minimum wage exists, it
 has not been relevant in setting wages since the 1960's. Instead, 80 percent of work-
 ers are covered by differing minimum wage rates for individual trades and profes-
 sions, all of which are sufficient to provide a decent standard of living for a worker
 and family. However, the recent growth of cottage industry, esecially in the manu-
 facture of clothing, prompted a government-funded report in March which spawned
 a Senate motion to inquire about outwork reform.
 Most workers are employees of incorporated organizations. For them, a complex
 body of government regulations, as well as decisions of applicable federal or state
 
 
 553
 industrial relations commissions, prescribe a 40-hour or shorter workweek, paid va-
 cations, sick leave, and other benefits, including at least one 24-hour rest period per
 week.
 Federal or state safety laws apply to every workplace.
 The Occupational Health an Safety (Commonwealth Employment) Act of 1991
 provides federal employees with the legal right to cease work if they believe that
 particular work activities pose an immediate threat to individual health or safety.
 Most states and territories have laws that grant similar rights to their employees.
 At a minimum, private sector employees have recourse to state health and safety
 commissions, which will investigate complaints and demind remedial action.
