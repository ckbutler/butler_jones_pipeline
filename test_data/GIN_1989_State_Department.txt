 GUINEA
 Guinea has been ruled by the military since 1984. Under
 President Lansana Conte, the military governs the country
 through the Military Committee for National Recovery (CMRN) and
 a joint military and civilian Council of Ministers. The
 regime, which came to power following the 24-year reign of
 Sekou Toure, suspended the constitution and rules through
 ordinances, decrees, and decisions issued by the President and
 various ministers.
 Military and paramilitary forces number about 17,000 persons
 (although accurate figures are difficult to obtain), with the
 army alone consisting of some 10,000 officers and soldiers.
 The 2,000-man national guard (Gendarmerie Nationale), a police
 force, and a well-armed presidential guard provide internal
 security. Both the military and police have been involved in
 human rights abuses. In particular, abuses by police appear to
 have been a motivating factor behind the reorganization of the
 security services in 1989, placing the police under the
 direction of an army officer.
 Eighty percent of Guinea's population of 7 million is dependent
 on subsistence agriculture. Per capita annual income is
 estimated at barely $300. Mineral resources, mainly bauxite,
 diamonds, and gold, are the major exports. Under President
 Conte, Guinea's economic reform program is attempting to
 diversify the small salaried work force, primarily through the
 creation of producers' associations and cooperatives and the
 promotion of foreign investment. However, efforts to reduce
 the size of the civil service, the largest employer, have left
 recent university graduates without jobs in the public sector,
 a sinecure under the old regime. Increasing unemployment in
 1989 was a source of growing government concern.
 The huiman rights situation has improved markedly since the
 Sekou Toure years; however, human rights in Guinea in 1989
 remained circumscribed despite frequent government declarations
 of an increased dedication to human rights. Major concerns
 were the failure of the military Government to control abuses
 by often poorly disciplined security forces, including killings
 and beatings; the Government's silence on the fate of prisoners
 still unaccounted for following a 1985 coup attempt; and the
 Government's restrictions on freedoms of speech and press,
 assembly and association, and the right of citizens to change
 their government through democratic means. Women's rights are
 restricted in several important areas. Acknowledging these
 concerns, especially those in the political sphere, the
 Government has widely publicized the promulgation of a new
 constitution, scheduled for December 1990. President Conte
 announced that this document would provide for an interim
 5-year period of mixed military/civilian stewardship leading to
 a multiparty, parliamentary system of government, headed by an
 elected president, with strict separation of powers. A
 drafting committee of 50 drawn from all sectors of educated
 Guinean society, is currently drawing up a new constitution.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 There were no reports of politically motivated killings in
 Guinea in 1989. However, in October the police in Labe beat to
 
 
 147
 death a young man who had been arrested on a minor charge.
 When a group protesting the incident marched on the police
 station and attacked it, the military was called in.
 Ultimately soldiers fired into the crowd, killing 6 persons and
 injuring 18. A government minister investigated the incident,
 and subsequently the Government ordered the arrest of police
 officers responsible for the young man's death. At the end of
 1989 no formal proceedings had been launched.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances
 in 1989. However, there is still uncertainty about the fate of
 a number of military officers, mainly from the Malinke ethnic
 group-,'who disappeared after their arrest following the 1985
 coup attempt (see also Section l.e.).
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 The military Government continued in 1989 to denounce the human
 rights atrocities of the former Toure dictatorship and publicly
 seeks to enforce provisions of the 1965 penal code which forbid
 torture and abuse of authority. However, mistreatment of
 detainees continues; the police and soldiers are widely
 perceived by the public as using excess force, frequently
 involving severe beatings as in the Labe incident. Amnesty
 International's (AI) 1989 report noted that several students,
 while in police custody in 1988, had been beaten and subjected
 to mock executions.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 A suspected criminal can be detained incommunicado by the
 arresting authority during preliminary investigation and has
 the right to counsel only after appearing before a judge. Such
 detention is limited to 48 hours, or 96 hours if an extension
 is granted by a tribunal. A system of bail for those accused
 of less serious crimes, as defined by the presiding judge, is
 available at the judge's discretion. In practice, despite
 presidential admonitions and campaigns in the government-owned
 media against corruption and harassment of citizens,
 paramilitary elements use arbitrary detention as a means of
 extortion. Political detainees, such as those held after the
 1985 coup attempt, are often held incommunicado and without
 charge for extended periods of time.
 The Government has encouraged Guinean expatriates, including
 former exiles of the Sekou Toure regime, to return home, but
 few have chosen to do so. Significant numbers of Guineans live
 in neighboring African countries and in France.
 With regard to forced or compulsory labor, see Section 6.c.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The Guinean penal code provides for the presumption of
 innocence of accused persons, the independence of judges, the
 equality of citizens before the law, the right of accused to
 counsel, and the right to appeal a judicial decision. The
 judiciary includes courts of first instance (for justices of
 the peace at the local level) and two Courts of Appeal (one in
 Kankan, one in Conakry). The Court of Annulment is the Guinean
 
 
 148
 GUINEA
 court of last appeal. A special Court of State Security was
 created in 1985 to try those allegedly involved in the July
 coup attempt, but it did not meet in 1989.
 According to ordinances issued in 1988, the Military Court
 prepares and adjudicates charges against accused military
 personnel, but to ensure equality before the law, all judgments
 regarding violations under the penal code are rendered by civil
 courts. Trials are public. Those accused of major crimes have
 the right to an attorney; those accused of less serious crimes
 must pay for legal counsel.
 There is a traditional system of justice at the village or
 urban neighborhood level where litigants present their civil
 case before a village chief, neighborhood chief, or council of
 wise men for judgment. Justice is not enforced uniformly. For
 example, burglars caught in urban areas are sometimes beaten to
 death by victims and their neighbors with the tacit approval of
 police authorities. Authorities have publicly condemned such
 summary justice.
 Human rights organizations have continued to criticize the
 Government's secretive handling of those tried by the State
 Security Court and the Military Court for alleged involvement
 either with the former Toure regime or the July 1985 coup
 attempt. Much of the information concerning trial procedures
 of these Courts was never made available, and the trials were
 widely perceived as unfair. Despite presidential amnesties on
 December 31, 1987, and on October 2, 1988, which released 106
 persons (including 79 military personnel), the fate of many
 others remained unknown at the end of 1989. It was widely
 believed that many of the announced death sentences had been
 summarily carried out shortly after the suspects were arrested
 in 1985. Guinean officials have informed diplomatic and
 international human rights observers that there are no longer
 any political detainees or prisoners held in Guinea, implying
 that all those imprisoned for their connection with the 1985
 coup have been released.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Government stresses traditional family values and the
 inviolability of the home. In general, the military Government
 is less willing than the previous regime to abuse police
 powers, although unwarranted interferences in citizens' lives
 continues, mainly through individual police harassment.
 Security officials are known to monitor mail and telephone
 calls.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Government has publicly stated that it supports free speech
 and press. However, citizens do not generally feel free to
 express public criticism of the Government, although criticism
 of government officials is heard in private discussions.
 The Government owns and operates the news media, and reporters
 (who are government employees) practice self-censorship. In
 1989 investigative reporting focused on social ills and
 unscrupulous commercial practices (a favorite target of
 official criticism), but no criticism of the senior levels of
 
 
 149
 GUfIEA
 goverpment or established policies was aired. The Ministry of
 Information, Culture and Tourism continues to act both as
 administrator and censor of media services.
 Publications which incite crime or are contrary to good morals
 are prohibited, as are insult, defamation, and libel. Some
 groups--operating for the most part abroad--have expressed
 criticism ifi clandestine tracts. Many foreign publications
 circulate freely in Guinea, including some critical of the
 Government, and no attempt is made to interfere with foreign
 radio broadcasts.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Public'gatherings can take place only with the approval of the
 Government. The Guinean penal code bans any meeting which has
 an ethnic or racial character or any gathering "whose nature
 threatens national unity." Opposition groups are not
 permitted. The Government does encourage the formation of
 nonpolitical professional organizations, and their numbers
 continue to increase.
 For a discussion of freedom of association as it applies to
 labor unions, see Section 6.a.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Guineans generally enjoy religious freedom and tolerance for
 the larger religious groups. Although an estimated 85 percent
 of the population is nominally Muslim, there is no official
 state religion. The Government observes both major Christian
 and Muslim holidays. The Government and the quasi-
 governmental National Islamic League (LIN) have spoken out
 against the "proliferation of pseudo-sects (within Guinean
 Islam) generating confusion and deviation." The President has
 declared that the LIN is the only organization with
 responsibility for coordinating the observance of Islam in
 Guinea. Foreign missionaries, both Catholic and Protestant,
 operate freely in Guinea.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 The Government restricts the freedom of movement of individual
 citizens for political reasons. For example, the 67 persons
 granted amnesty at the end of 1987 were restricted to their
 area of origin following their release from prison. That
 restriction has gradually been relaxed in many cases and left
 to the discretion of local prefects (governors).
 Most Guineans, however, are free to move about the country and
 to change their place of residence and work, although in
 practice they face harassment by police and military
 roadblocks, particularly at night. It is common for individual
 citizens to pay bribes to avoid police harassment. Foreign
 travel, strictly curtailed under Sekou Toure, is now permitted.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Citizens are unable to change their government through
 democratic procedures. The military Government suspended the
 constitution and banned political parties and formal political
 activity when it took power in April 1984. The Government
 
 
 150
 GINfEA
 delayed its previously announced intention to introduce a new
 constitution in 1989. Rather, President Conte announced in
 October that there would be an interim 5-year period of mixed
 military/civilian stewardship leading eventually to a
 multiparty, parliamentary system of government, headed by a
 president, with strict separation of powers. At the end of
 1989, the interim changes in government had not been introduced
 or a timetable announced.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Senior government officials received representatives of the
 International Committee of the Red Cross concerning
 humanitarian issues, including possible prison visits. There
 are no local organizations reporting on human rights issues in
 Guinea.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 While racial or ethnic discrimination is prohibited by the
 penal code, ethnic identification is still very strong in
 Guinea, and mutual suspicion affects relations across ethnic
 lines within and outside the Government. Official government
 policy is to include representatives of all major ethnic groups
 in the Government, but the Soussou ethnic group, to which
 President Conte belongs, tends to predominate at the highest,
 most influential levels. A disproportionate number of police
 are Malinke, former President Toure's ethnic group.
 Clandestinely circulated opposition tracts frequently play on
 ethnic tensions to stir resentment against the Government. As
 noted, many of those that "disappeared" after the 1985 coup
 came from the Malinke ethnic group.
 In rural Guinea, opportunities for women are limited by custom
 and the traditional demands of subsistence farming. The
 Government has affirmed the principle of equal pay for equal
 work, but in practice women receive less pay than men in most
 jobs.
 Violence against women, mainly wife beating, is prohibited
 under criminal law and is a ground for divorce under civil
 law. Police rarely intervene in domestic disputes, and
 prosecution of wife beaters is unusual but has occurred.
 Health workers in Guinea state that wife beating exists, but
 they differ in their opinions on the extent of the problem and
 its severity. The issue has not received significant publicity
 or government attention.
 Female genital mutilation (circumcision) is practiced among all
 religious groups in Guinea: Muslims, Christians, and animists.
 According to Western health workers, the practice is nearly
 universal among Guineans. Grandmothers will frequently see to
 the circumcision of a granddaughter even when the parents are
 opposed. The most dangerous form of circumcision,
 infibulation, is not practiced.

 GUINEA
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 .Guinea's new labor code, drafted with the assistance of the
 International Labor Organization (ILO) and promulgated in
 January 1988, states that all workers have the right to create
 and participate in organizations that defend and develop their
 individual and collective rights as workers. The code also
 provides that workers have the right not to be a member of such
 organizations. Further, it stipnlates that a union must be
 independent.of political parties to be recognized as
 representative of workers. The code requires elected worker
 representatives for any enterprise employing 25 salaried
 workers. The code also grants salaried workers the right to
 strike I days after their representative union makes known
 their intention to strike.
 In practice, .most salaried Guineans--many of whom are civil
 servants--are affiliated with the country's sole trade union
 central, the Guinean. National Labor Confederation (CNTG), which
 has close ties to the Government. Private sector workers may
 strike only with the permission of the CNTG board, a
 requirement which reduces the likelihood of strikes. In March
 taxicab drivers in Conakry participated in a 1 to 2 day strike,
 protesting police, harassment and increased-insurance and
 gasoline rates. According to reports, police arrested and
 detained briefly over 50 rock-throwing drivers. Police held
 the strike leader for several days. In the past, the
 Government has dealt sternly with wildcat strikers, including
 banning those.in the public sector from furthergovernment
 employment.. The CNTG is affiliated with the.Organization of
 African Trade Union Unity.
 The ILO Committee of Experts (COE) has commended the Government
 for its new labor code but also noted that some question still
 remains regarding legislative provisions that provide for the
 establishment of compulsory arbitration. In its 1989 report
 the COE commended a revision of the code limiting the
 Government'spower to refer a dispute to compulsory arbitration
 to cases involving "essential services" and "national crisis."
 However,,the COE'observed that the statute still permits either
 party to invooke, compulsory arbitration, a practice that could
 limit the right to strike, according to the: Committee.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 Under the new code, representative workers' unions or union
 groups can organize in the workplace and negotiate with
 employers or employer unions. Union delegates are to represent
 individual and collective claims and grievances before the
 employer. Work rules and work hours established by the
 employer are to be developed in consultation with union
 delegates. individual workers threatened with dismissal or
 other sanctions have the right to.a hearing before the employer
 with a uni6n representative present. Employers must give-
 advance notice of any plan to reduce the size of their work
 force for economic reasons.
 In practice, CNTG representatives take the lead in labor/
 management talks. Collective bargaining has taken place, most
 notably in 1986 when the CNTG concluded an agreement with the
 mining companies, and again in 1988 when bank employees
 collectively bargained for substantially higher salaries.
 
 
 152
 GUIN~EA
 Labor legislation is applied uniformly throughout the country.
 There are no export processing zones.
 The above cited COE 1989 report commended the Government for
 removing a provision of the law restricting the right to hold
 union offices to Guinean nationals.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Forced or compulsory labor is not practiced in Guinea, and
 article 2 of the labor code specifically forbids it. The COE
 has noted the Government's stated intention to revise or repeal
 various obsolete laws to bring them into compliance with ILO
 conventions on forced labor.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 The minimum age for employment in practice as well as in the
 new code is 16 years of age. Apprentices, however, may be as
 young as 14 years old. Workers and apprentices below age 18
 are not permitted to work at night or more than 12 consecutive
 hours or on Sundays. According to the labor code, the Minister
 of Labor must maintain a list of occupations in which women and
 youth under age 18 may not be employed. Enforcement of these
 provisions outside of the modern sector of the economy,
 however, tends to be erratic, particularly in rural areas where
 children of all ages work on family farms.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 The Government has not yet enacted minimum wage legislation,
 but the labor code provides for the eventual establishment by
 decree of a guaranteed minimum hourly wage. There are also
 provisions for overtime and night wage rates which are fixed
 percentages of the regular wage. Wages currently paid the
 average worker in the public sector are generally not
 sufficient to provide a decent standard of living. According
 to the code, regular work is not to exceed 10-hour days or
 48-hour weeks, with a 40-hour workweek being the norm. The
 minimum weekly day of rest must be 24 consecutive hours,
 usually on Sunday. Every salaried worker has the right to an
 annual paid holiday accumulated at the rate of at least 2.5
 workdays per month of service. Several articles of the code
 provide for safe working conditions and the continued good
 health of workers. These as yet represent the goal rather than
 the practice.
