 IRAQ*
 Political power in Iraq is concentrated in a repressive one-party apparatus domi-
 nated by Saddam Hussein. The provisional Constitution of 1968 stipulates that the
 Arab Ba'ath Socialist Party governs Iraq through the Revolutionary Command
 Council (RCC), which exercises both executive and legislative authority. President
 Saddan Hussein, who is also Prime Minister, Chairman of the RCC, and Secretary
 General of the Regional Command of the ABSP, wields decisive power. A "referen-
 dum" was held on Saddam's presidency in October, Saddam received 99.96 of the
 vote for election to the presidency for a term of 7 years. This referendum was not
 democratic: it included neither secret ballots nor opposing candidates, and voters
 feared possible reprisal for a negative vote.
 Ethncally and linguistically, the Iraqi population includes Arabs, Kurds,
 Turomans, Yazids, and Armenians. Historically, the religious mix is likewise var-
 id   Shi'a and Sunni Muslims (both Arab and Kurdsh), Christians (including
 caleans and Asans), and ews (mst of wom       ave emigted), thnic divi-
 sions have resulted in civil uprisings in recent years, especially in the north and
 the suth. The Government has reacted against those who revolt with extreme re-
 pression.
 The Government's security apparatus includes militias attached to the President,
 the Ba'ath Party, and the Interior Ministry. Security forces have been responsible
 for widespread and systematic human rights abuses. They play a central role in
 maintaining the environment of intimidation and fear on which government power
 rests.
 The Government controls most of the economy, which is largely based on oil pro-
 duction, and owns all major industries. Damaged by the Gulf War and subjected to
 United Nations sanctions as a result of Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait, the economy
 continues to deteriorate. The sanctions ban all exports and allows imports only of
 food, medicine, and materials and supplies for essential civilian needs. The Gvern-
 ment's failure to comply with U.N. Security Council resolutions has led to repeated
 extensions of the sanctions. In April the Security Council passed U.N Security
 Council Resolution (UNSCR) 986 allowing a controlled sale of Iraqi oil to purchase
 food and other humanitarian goods to improve the deteriorating situation of the
 Iraqi people. The Government has refused to allow implementation of this resolution
 which would provide substantial relief supplies, but a senior-level delegation from
 Baghdad heldan inconclusive round of negotiations with the UN. Secretariat in
 February 1996. A second round has been scheduled for March.
 The Government's poor record on human rights did not improve in 1995. Human
 rights abuses are difficult to document because of government efforts to conceal the
 facts, including its refusal to permit visits by human rights monitors or other ob-
 servers and continued restrictions designed to prevent dissent. Nevertheless, it is
 clear that systemic violations increased as the regime expanded its use of torture
 and further tightened its ontrol over a all spets of Iraqi politics and society.
 Throughout the year, the Government forcibly transferred hundreds of govern-
 ment workers from one job to another, purportedly to prevent the development of
 extential opposition in any government institutions. After a failed coup attempt in
 food   and further disturbances in May and June, the Government arrested, re-
 moved from their jobs, or otherwise punished numerous Iraqis for their alleged asso-
 ciation with these incidents. After Saddam's daughters and their husbands, Hussein
 Kamel and Saddam Kamel al-Majid, defected to Jordan in August, the Government

 large extent on non-U.S. Government sources.

 reportedly arrested scores of mid-level military and civilian officials for their asso-
 ciation with the defectors. The two men and their families returned to Iraq in Feb-
 ruary 1996 after receiving promises of amnesty. Shortly after entering Iraq, the two
 were separated from their families and were killed, allegedly in a gunfight with rel-
 atives. Opposition sources report that Saddam or his sons were involved in the exe-
 cutions.
 The number of summary executions of perceived political opponents reportedly, in-
 creased, and reports of disappearances continued. Tens of thousands of political
 killings and disappearances remain unresolved from previous years. The authorities
 routinely use arbitrary arrest and detention. The judiciary is not independent; the
 President can override any court decision. The Government continues to deny citi-
 zens the right to due process and privacy and severely limits freedom of religion and
 workers' rights.
 Citizens do not have the right to change their government. The October "referen-
 dum7 on Saddam's presidency was not free. It was dismissed by most international
 observers. Max van der Stoel, the Special Rapporteur for Iraq appointed by the U.N.
 Human Rights Commission (UNHRC), cited the denial of a secret ballot and fear
 of reprisal for a negative vote. Freedom of speech, the press, assembly, and associa-
 tion do not exist, except in the northern areas which enjoy the protection of an
 internationally enforced safehaven.
 Iraqi military operations continued to target Shi'a Arabs living in the southern
 marshes. In central and southern Iraq, the regime continued to divert humanitarian
 supplies to its security forces, the milita  nd other supporters. The Government
 maintained an internal embargo againstraq'a northern governorates, blocking the
 shipment of food, medicine, and other goods from government-controlled territory to
 the Kurdish-controlled areas.
 As socioeconomic conditions deteriorated, the regime punished persons accused of
 economic crimes, military desertion, and a variety of other charges with torture, in-
 cluding the extensive use of amputation. The Government persisted in its flagrant
 interference with the international community's provision of humanitarian assist-
 ance, in contravention of the conditions of UNSCR 688. It harassed and intimidated
 relief workers as well as U.N. security personnel throughout the country. Reliable
 reports indicate that the Government continues to offer rewards for killing inter-
 national relief personnel.
 Northern Iraq was the scene of continued fighting between the two main Iraqi
 Kurd groups, the Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) and the Patriotic Union of
 Kurdistan (PUK), in which both fighters and civilians were killed. Clashes with the
 Turkish terrorist organization, the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), also resulted
 in the death of both fighters and civilians. Both Iraqi Kurdish groups and the PKK
 reportedly tortured civilians.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-The regime has a long record of exe-
 cuting perceived opponents. The U.N. Special Rapporteur, the international media,
 and other groups all reported an increased number of summary executions in 1995.
 In his February report to the U.N. Human Rights Commission, the Special
 Rapporteur stated that the Government's "aim of killing is a political one, with the
 objective of silencing dissent and suppressing opposition.
 As in previous years, there were numerous credible reports that the regime exe-
 cuted persons allegedly involved in plotting against Saddam, including high-ranking
 civilian, military, and tribal leaders, as well as members of his family and clan. One
 unconfirmed eyewitness report charged that 200 prisoners were executed in Feb-
 ruary at the Abu Ghurayb prison. Other executions occurred after several
 antiregime disturbances. The most serious incidents included an uprising in March
 led by former Gn. Wafiq al-Samarra'i an uprising in May led by Gen. Turk Ismail
 Dulaimi and other members of the Dulaimi clan; and the Augut defections of Hus-
 sein and Saddam Kamel, Saddam's sons-in-law who held high-ranking government
 positions. An undetermined number of peopl e   believed to have been executed
 extra udicially after each of these events.
 This trend continued in early 1996, when Husein and Saddam Kamel returned
 to Iraq from Jordan after reportedly receiving an amnesty. Several days after their
 return, the two were murder-ed, allegdy b  relatives who claimed that they t ook_
 action to punish the defectors for "treason. At least two other relatives who had
 not defected were killed during these attacks. While the details of the murders are
 unavailable, at least one opposition parti asserted that Saddam Hussein and his
 son, Uday, were involved in inciting the killings.
 
 
 1162
 The Special Rapporteur noted continued reports of the frequent use of the death
 penalty for such offenses as "insulting the President or the Ba'ath Party. In reports
 submitted to the U.N. Human Rights Commission in September and November, the
 Special Rapporteur cited several government decrees stipulating the death penalty
 for certain political and civil offenses (see Section i.e.) Numeous midlevel officials
 and local leaders who fled government-contrlled areas cited the fear of extrajudicial
 killing as a reason for their flight.
 In his November report, the Special Rapporteur noted that some condemned con-
 victs can buy their freedom by bribing the judge. Others have reported that in such
 cases the convict helps authorities find another person to be executed in the
 accused's place.
 The Special Rapporteur, Human Rights Watch (HRW), and other human rights
 groups reported that the Government executed several doctors who refused to per-
 form amputations imposed on persons convicted of certain crimes, or who performed
 corrective surgery on such amputees (see Section 1.c.).
 Government forces have reportedly executed numerous Shi'a inhabitants of the
 south marshes, but there was no independent means to verify these reports (see
 Section 1.g.).
 Indications persist that the Government has offered "bounties" to anyone who as-
 sassinates United Nations or other international relief workers in northern Iraq.
 During the year, the regime continued to deny the widespread killings of Kurds
 in northern Irad during the "Anfal" Campaign of 1988 (see Sections 1.b. and 1.g.).
 Both the Speciat Rapporteur and HRW have concluded that the Government's poli-
 cies against the Kurds raise issues of crimes against humanity and violations of the
 1948 Genocide Convention.
 There was no further information on the death of the prominent Shi'a
 oppositionist Taki Al-Khoei, who, along with three others, was killed in 1994 in a
 suspicious automobile crash in southern Iraq. Strong circumstantial evidence points
 to the Government's involvement.
 During the year, political killings and terrorist actions occurred in northern Iraq.
 Intra-Krdish fighting erupted over the first half of the year between two Iraqi
 Kurdish groups, the PUK and the KDP. An undetermined number of fighters and
 civilians were killed in these attacks. Later in 1995, elements of the PKK, a Turkish
 Kurd terrorist group, increased their activity in northern Iraq and reportedly killed
 local residents in an effort to control a territorial base. These groups sometimes at-
 tacked civilians, foreign relief workers, and journalists.
 b. Disappearance.-The Special Rapporteur stated in November that he continues
 to receive reports on widespread disappearances, especially in southern Iraq. The
 Government has not replied to any of the more than 15,000 cases conveyed to it in
 1994 and 1995 by the U.N. Working Group on Enforcement on Involuntary Dis-
 appearances.
 The United Nations has documented over 16,000 cases of disappeared persons. Ac-
 cording to the Special Rapporteur, most of these cases occurred during the Anfal
 Campaign. He estimates    at the total number of Kurds who disappeared during
 Anfal could reach the tens of thousands. HRW estimates the total at between 70,000
 and 150,000, and Amnesty International (AI) at more than 100,000.
 The Special Rapporteur and several human rights groups continued to request
 that the Government provide information about the arrest in 1991 of the late Grand
 Ayatollah Abdul Qasim Al-Khoei and 108 of his associates. The Ayatollah died while
 under house arrest in Al-Najaf. Others arrested with him have not been accounted
 for and the regime refuses to respond to queries regarding their status.
 'he Government failed to return or account for, a large number of Kuwaiti citi-
 zens and third-country nationals detained during the Iraqi occupation of Kuwait.
 Regime officials, including military leaders known to have been among the last to
 see the disappeared during the occupation, have refused to respond to the hundreds
 of outstanding inquiries a ut the missing. The regime denies havig any knowl-
 edge of them and claims that relevant records were lost in the aftermath of the Gulf
 War.
 In addition to the tens of thousands of reported disappearances, human rights
 $roups report that the Government continues to hold thousands of other Iraqis in
 incommunicado detention.
 Several kidnapings took place during fighting among Kurdish factions in northern
 Iraq. In September supporters of the PK took hostage several Iraqi and foreign
 relief workers at a Turkish Kurd refugee camp. AU were eventually released
 unharmed.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The security services routinely torture detainees, even though the Government is a
 party to international conventions against torture and the Constitution prohibits the
 
 
 1163
 practice. In his November report, the Special Rapporteur noted the Government's
 systemic use of physical and psychological torture, especially in southern Iraq. Ac-
 cording to former detainees, torture techniques include brandings electric shocks
 administered to the genitals and other areas beatings, burnings with hot irons sus-
 pension from ceiling fans, dripping acid on te skin, rape, breaking of limbs, denial
 of food and water, and threats to rape or otherwise harm relatives. Tormentors kill
 many torture victims and mutilate their bodies before returning them to the victims'
 families.
 The regime continues to practice amputation of ears and hands, as well as brand-
 ing, as punishment for crimes ranging from theft to military desertion. Eyewitnesses
 reported that the Government carried out second amputations and brandings on re-
 peat offenders   and  on   those  who  sought corrective   surgery  for earlier
 disfigurements. In some of these cases, the regime executed the offenders as well
 as the doctors who either performed corrective surgery or refused to carry out ampu-
 tations. In his November report, the Special Rapporteur concluded that the amputa-
 tions and brandings are "gross violations of human rights."
 Several government officials cited Islamic law (Sharia) as a rationale for ampu-
 tating the right hands of convicted thieves, but none commented on the punish-
 ments imposed on repeat offenders or the Government's disregard for rights pro-
 tected under Islamic law. One senior official claimed that brandings were instituted
 in order to avoid confusing criminals with war veterans who had-lost limbs in bat-
 tle.
 The Special Rapporteur, human rights organizations, and opposition groups con-
 tinue to receive numerous reports of women still suffering severe depression after
 they were raped while in custody. The security forces allegedly raped women cap-
 tured during the Anfal Campaign and during the occupation of Kuwait. The Govern-
 ment has never acknowledged these reports of rape or conducted any investigation.
 Although the regime made a variety of pronouncements against rape and other vio-
 lent crimes during the year, it took no action against regime activists who commit-
 ted this abuse.
 Certain prisons are notorious for routine mistreatment of prisoners. AI-Rashidiya
 Prison, on the Tigris River north of Taji, reportedly has torture chambers. The Al-
 Shamma'iya Prison, located in east Baghdad1, holds the mentally ill and is report-
 edly the site of both torture and disappearances.
 The Al-Radwaniyah Prison is a former prisoner-of-war facility near Baghdad and
 reportedly the site of torture as well as mass executions. This prison was the prin-
 cipal detention center for persons arrested following the civil uprisings of 1991, and
 returned to prominence in May as the site of executions following an uprising led
 by members of the Dulaimi clan (see Section L.a.). Many persons taken into custody
 in connection with this and other civil uprisings have not een seen since. HRW and
 others estimate that the Al-Radwaniyah Prison holds more than 5,000 detainees,
 only a few of whom may have been released following a so-called "amnesty" an-
 nouncement in July (see Section 1.d.).
 There were reports that Iraqi Kurdish groups tortured captured criminal suspects
 and political opponents. The PKI also reportedly tortured civilians captured in
 northern Iraq in the latter half of the year.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Although the Constitution and Legal
 Code explicitly prohibit arbitrary arrest and detention, the authorities routinely en-
 gage in these practices. In his September report, the Special Rapporteur stated that
 the existence of several repressive laws "quells freedom of thought, information, ex-
 pression, association, and assembly through fear of arrest." The military and secu-
 rity services, rather than the ordinary police, carry out most cases of arbitrary ar-
 rest and detention. Government officials have linked ending these practices to the
 lifting of the international embargo. They maintain that the arrests are a temporary
 preventive measure and d not constitute human rights violations.
 In the aftermath of several security incidents, security forces reportedly arrested
 hundreds of persons perceived as security threats, mainly on the basis of an individ-
 ual's personal a  iation or family onnection with opponents of the regime. Many
 of those arrested were reportedly killed while in custody (see Section l.a.).
 According to international human rights groups, numerous foreigners arrested ar-
 bitrarily in previous years remain in detent ion. n March the regime arrested two
 Americans who unknowingly crossed the Iraqi border with Kuwait. The regime's ef-
 forts to link the fate of the two men to political issues failed, and the two were re-
 leased in July.
 In July the Government issued two "amnesty" decrees: Decree No. 61, for certain
 convicted criminals, and Decree No. 64 for those convicted of political offenses. The
 Special Rapporteur noted that Decree No. 61 stipulates that criminals granted am-
 nesty maybe convicted again of the same crimes for which they were sentenced and
 
 
 1164
 that Decree No. 64 requires those granted amnesty to report to competent authori-
 ties in order to benefit. He also noted that because "there is no effective rule of law
 in Iraq, there will be little confidence in the reliability of amnesty decrees."
 Human rights groups concluded that the amnesties should not be considered le-
 gitimate. HRW observed that when some 3,000 residents of southern Iraq came for-
 ward for a similar amnesty in 1991, they were placed on trucks and subsequently
 disappeared. Further, two Iraqis who specifically were granted amnesties before re-
 turning from Jordan, where they had earlier defected, were murdered shortly after
 their return (see Section L.a.).
 There was insufficient information to determine how many persons were released
 or accepted the amnesties.
 The Special Raporteur and opposition sources reported that the regime continued
 to target the Shi'aMuslim clergy and their supporters for arbitrary arrest and other
 abuses. The Government reportedly forced some Shi'a of southern Iraq to move to
 northern areas near Kirkuk, purportedly to "Arabize" that historically Kurdish area.
 At the same time, the Government deported hundreds of Turcomans from their
 northern Iraqi homes, either to areas outside government control or to southern
 Iraq. It also refused to allow tens of thousands of Kurds and Turcomans to return
 to heir homes in Kirkuk and Mosul. These forced movements amount to a policy
 of internal exile (see Section 2.d.). There were no reports that the Government forc-
 ibly exiled anyone from Iraq.
 e. Denial of Fair Public TriaL--The judiciary is not independent, and there is no
 check on the President's power to override any court decision. The Special
 Rapporteur and international human rights groups all observed during the year
 that the repressive nature of the political and legal systems eviscerates any concept
 of rule of law.
 There are two parallel judicial systems: the regular courts, which try common
 criminal offenses; and special security courts, which generally try national security
 cases, but may also try criminal cases.
 Procedures in the regular courts theoretically provide for many protections. How-
 ever the regime often assigns to the security courts cases which on their merits,
 would appear to fall under the jurisdiction of the regular courts. Trials in the regu-
 lar courts are public, and defendants are entitled to counsel, at government expense
 in the case of indigents. Defense lawyers have the right to review the charges and
 evidence brought against their clients. There is no jury system; panels of three
 judges try cases. Defendants have the right to appeal to the Court of Appeal and
 then to the Court of Cassation, the highest court.
 The Special Rapporteur noted in his November report that numerous laws lend
 themselves to continued oppression, such as the 1994 decree stipulating the death
 penalty for automobile theft, smuggling, various categories of theft, and solicitation
 or the purposes of prostitution. In 1995 the Government also announced the death
 penalty for possession of stolen goods and for the failure of agricultural workers to
 supplyfood for government distribution.
 Government shields certain groups from prosecution for alleged crimes. A
 1992 decree grants immunity from prosecution to members of the Ba'ath Party and
 the security forces who kill anyone while in pursuit of army deserters. Unconfirmed
 but widespread reports indicate that this decree was applied often in 1995 to pre-
 vent trials or punishment of such government officials as Uday Saddam Hussein,
 the President's son. A 1990 decree grants immunity to men who kill their mothers,
 daughters, and other female family members who have committed "immoral deeds."
 Special security courts have jurisdiction in all cases involving espionage and trea-
 son peaceful political dissent, smuggling, currency exchange violations, and drug
 traffcking. According to the Special Rapporteur and other sources, military officers
 or civil servants with no legal training head these tribunals, which hear cases in
 secret. Authorities often hold defendants incommunicado and do not permit contact
 with lawyers. The courts admit confessions extracted by torture, which often serve
 as the basis for conviction.
 Many cases appear to end in summary execution, although defendants may ap-
 peal to the President for clemency. Saddam may grant clemency in any case that
 apparently suits his political goals, for example, the case of the two detained Ameri-
 cans and the purported amnesty for Iraqi exiles (see Section 1.d.).
 There are no Shari'a, or Islamic law, courts as such. Regular courts are empow-
 ered to administer Islamic law in cases involving personal status, such as divorce
 and inheritance.
 Because the Government rarely acknowledges arrests or imprisonments, it is dif-
 ficult to estimate the number of political prisoners. Many of the tens of thousands
 of persons who have disappeared or been killed in recent years were originally held
 as political prisoners.
 
 
 1165
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Government frequently disregards the constitutional right to privacy, particularly in
 cases allegedly involving national security. The law defines security offenses so
 broadly that authorities are virtually exempt from the legal requirement to obtain
 search warrants. In 1995 the authorities subjected Iraqis of various ethnic groups
 and tribal affiliations to searches without warrants (see Section 1.g.). The regime
 routinely ignores the constitutional provisions safeguarding the confidentiality of
 mail, telegraphic correspondence, and telephone conversations. The Government pe-
 riodically jams news broadcasts, including those of opposition groups, from outside
 security services and the Ba'ath Party maintain pervasive networks of in-
 formers to deter dissident activity and instill fear in the public. Voters in the Octo-
 ber "referendum" were required to name relatives on their ballots and, according to
 some opposition reports, threatened with punishment against their families if they
 voted against extending Saddam's rule.
 In his November report, the Special Rap rteur noted that because of the intru-
 siveness of the security apparatus "virtualy no citizen would risk demonstrating
 any opposition to the Presidency or Government-or would do so at his mortal
 peril."
 g. Use of Excessive Force and Violations of Humanitarian Law in Internal Con-
 fiicts.-As in previous years, Iraqi armed forces conducted deliberate artillery at-
 tacks against Shi'a civilians in the southern marshes and against minority groups
 in northern Iraq. In 1992 the Gulf War allies imposed a no-fly zone" over both
 northern and southern Iraq. The no-fly zones continue to deter aerial attacks on the
 marsh dwellers in southern Iraq and residents of northern Iraq, but they do not pre-
 vent artillery attacks in either area or the military's large-scale burning operations
 in the south.
 Throughout the year, the Government announced that it would undertake several
 water-diversion and other projects, which continued the process of large-scale envi-
 ronmental destruction. The Government claims the drainage is part of a land rec-
 lamation plan to increase the acreage of arable land, spur agricultural production,
 and reduce salt pollution in the Tigris and Euphrates rivers. However, the evidence
 of large-scale human and ecological destruction appears to belie this claim.
 Credible reports confirm the ongoing destruction of the marshes. The army contin-
 ued to construct canals, causeways, and earthen berms to divert water from the wet-
 lands. Hundreds of square kilometers have been burned in military operations.
 Moreover, the regime's diversion of supplies in the south limited the population's ac-
 cess to food, medici ne, drinking water, and transportation.
 The Government maintains an internal embargo against the three governorates
 in northern Iraq, populated primarily by Kurds and other ethnic minorities. The em-
 bargo prevents the entry of food, medicine, and other humanitarian supplies to that
 area. Beginning in 1993, the embargo also included electric power cut-offs in specific
 areas, causing the disruption of water and sanitation systems, and interfering with
 the delivery of food and fuel. The United Nations and donor governments installed
 temporary generators to alleviate the crisis. In July the Government restored some
 electricity and allowed increased fuel trade with the northern governorate of Dohuk,
 but the fuel trade was again severely restricted with the onset of winter. The entire
 northern area remains subject to the threat of future cut-offs.
 Operation Provide Comfort-a multinational coalition made up of the US., United
 Kingdom, France, and Turkey--continued enforcement of a "no fly zone" to inhibit
 government aerial activit to repress citizens in northern Iraq. However, govern-
 ment military forces continued intermittent, sometimes heavy shelling of northern
 villages by long-range artillery. The Government also maintained efforts to "Arab-
 ize" certain areas, such as the urban centers of Kirkuk and Mosul, through the
 forced movement of local residents from their homes and villages and their replace-
 ment by Arabs from outside the area (see Section 1.d.).
 Civilians were the victims of fightingbetween the forces of the two main Iraqi
 Kurd political groups, the KDP and thie PUK, during the first half of 1995. A
 ceasefire during the second half of the year sharply reduced the number of civilian
 casualties and the use of torture on those detained or arrested.
 The PKK committed numerous abuses against civilians in northern Iraq in the
 latter half of the year. In September the PKK seized eight U.N. relief workers as
 hostages at the Atrush refugee camp. The camp, populated by some 14,000 Turkish
 Kurds, has been suspected as a base for PKK terrorist activities. The relief workers
 were released unharmed after 3 days.
 In March Turkish armed forces entered northern Iraq in pursuit of PKK terrorists
 and bases. Human rights organizations charged that the Turkish operation, which
 lasted 8 weeks, resulted in some civilian deaths. However, Turkish Government an-
 
 
 1166
 
 thorities stressed that the operation sought to avoid civilian casualties. There were
 several unconfirmed reports of civilian casualties during four smaller Turkish oper-
 ations into northern Iraq during 1995.
 Land mines in northern Iraq, mostly planted by the Government before 1991, con-
 tinued to kill or maim civilians. Many of the mines were laid during the Iran-Iraq
 War, but the army failed to clear them before it abandoned the area. The mines
 appear to have been haaardly planted in civilian areas. The Special Rapporteur
 has repeatedly reminded the Government of its obligations under the Land Mines
 Protocol, to which Iraq is a party, to protect civilians from the effects of mines. Var-
 ious nongovernmental organizations continue efforts to remove mines from the area
 and increase mine awareness among local residents.
 Based on interviews with victims and eyewitnesses, the U.S. Government has con-
 cluded that the Ira i regimengaged in war crimes--willful killing, torture, rape
 pillage, hostage-taking, unlawful deportation, and associated acts-directly related
 to the Gulf War. The U.S. Government continues to urge the U.N. Security Council
 to establish an international commission to study evidence of a broader range of war
 crimes, as well as crimes aans humanity and possible genocide.
 Tugout the year, HW worked with various governments to bring a genocide
 case at the International Court of Justice against the Government for its conduct
 of the Anfal Campaign against the Kurds in 1988.111RW reported that the case is
 based on the evidence obtained from mass graves, government documents, and
 interviews with eyewitnesses. HRW and Physicians for Human Rights estimate that
 between 70,000 and 100,000 Kurds were killed, and up to 4,000 villages destroyed,
 during the Anfal Campaign. The evidence suggests that government efforts to elimi-
 nate Kurdish communities were widespread, systematica ly planned, and ruthlessly
 implemented.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-Freedom of speech and of the press do not exist,
 and political dissent is not tolerated in areas under the Government's control. The
 Government and the Ba'ath Party own all print and broadcast media and operate
 them as propaganda outlets. They generally do not report opposing points of view
 that are expressed either domestically or abroad. The Govenment also jams foreign
 news broadcasts (see Section IS.).
 Several statutes and decrees suppress freedom of speech and the press. These in-
 clude a 1986 decree stipulating the death penalty for anyone insulting the President
 or other high government officials; Section 214 of the Penal Code, which prohibits
 singing a song likely to cause civil strife; and the Press Act of 1968, which prohibits
 the writing of articles on 12 specific subjects, including those detrimental to the
 President.
 The Government arbitrarily detains writers who criticize or question government
 1995 security forces detained Aziz Said Jasim, a poitical theorist, and
 am Hashin, a journalist who published an article on the marsh Arabs of
 southern Iraq.
 Foreigners are also subject to restrictions on freedom of the press. The Govern-
 ment refused to admit a returning Danish member of the U.N. Guard Contingent
 in Iraq, which protects international humanitarian workers throughout Iraq, for car-
 rying a foreign newspaper with unfavorable coverage of Saddam.
 nnorthern Iraq, several newspapers have appeared over the past 3 years, as
 have opposition radio and televimon broadcasts.  e absence of central authority
 permits some freedom of expression, although most journalists are influenced or
 controlled by various political organizations.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-Except in northern areas, citi-
 zens may not legally assemble or organize for any political purpose other than to
 express support  or the regime. The Government regularly orchestrates crowds to
 demonstrate support for the regime and its policies through financial incentives for
 those who participate and threats of violence against those who do not.
 The Government controls the establishment of political parties, regulates their in-
 ternal affairs, and monitors their activities. Several parties are specifically out-
 lawed, and membership in them is a capital offense. A 1974 law prescribes the
 death penalty for anyone "infiltrating" the Ba'ath Party.
 Unconfirmed reports continued to circulate of small demonstrations and even con-
 frontations between farm workers and the security forces. One unconfirmed incident
 occurred in November when some 200 farmers demonstrated in An-Najaf province
 near Baghdad to protest the requirement that they contribute most of their produce
 to government authorities for rationing.
 c. Freedom of Relgion.-The Government severely limits freedom of religion. The
 Provisional Constitution of 1968 states that "Islam is the religion of the State." The
 
 
 1167
 Ministry of Endowments and Religious Affairs monitors places of worship, appoints
 the clergy and approves the publication of religious literature.
 Although Shi'a Muslim Arabs, who compose between 60 and 65 percent of the
 population, are the largest religious group, Sunni Arabs (composing only about 12
 to 15 percent of the population) have traditionally dominated economic and political
 life. Des pite legal guarantees of sectarian equality, the regime has in recent years
 repressed the Shi'a clergy and followers of the Shia faith. Security forces have wan-
 tonly desecrated Shi'a mosques and holy sites, particularly in the aftermath of the
 1991 civil uprisings. Opposition sources charged that Saddam's late son-in-law, Hus-
 sein Kamel, committedmany human rights violations in putting down the 1991 up-
 rising in southern Iraq.
 The following government restrictions on religious rights remained in effect
 throughout 1995: a ban on the Muslim call to prayer in certain cities; a ban on the
 broadcast of Shi'a programs on government radio or television- a ban on the publica-
 tion of Shi'a books, including prayer books- a ban on funeral processions- and the
 prohibition of certain processions and public meetings commemorating Shi'a holy
 ays. Moreover the Government also continued to insist that its own appointee re-
 place the late Grand Ayatollah Abul Qasim Al-Khoei, formerly the highest ranking
 Iraqi Shi'a clerrman, who died in government custody in 1992 (see Section 1.b.).
 The Shi'a religious establishment refuses to accept the Government's choice. The
 Government    so continued to harass and threaten members of the late Ayatollah
 Al-Khoei's family (see Sections L.a. and 1.b.).
 The Special Rapporteur and others report that the Government has engaged in
 various abuses against the country's 350,000 Assyrian Christians. Most Assyrians
 traditionally live in the northern governorates, and the Government often has sus-
 pected them of "ollaborating" with Ku   . Miitary forces destroyed numerous As-
 syrian churches during the Anfal Campaign and reportedly tortured and executed
 many Assyrians (see Section 4). According to HR1W and Assyrian sources, the Gov-
 ernment continues to harass and kill Assyrians throughout the country by forced
 relocations, terror, and artillery shelling.
 HR1W also reported that a group of five Iraqi Jehovah Witnesses were held for
 more than 2 months without trial by government security forces. During their im-
 prisonment, they were reportedly beaten, placed in severely overcrowded facilities,
 and denied adequate food. Although now out of prison, they still suffer periodic har-
 assment, threats of imprisonment, and extortion.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Government controls the movement within the country of citizens
 and foreigners. Persons who enter sensitive border areas and numerous designated
 security zones are subject to arrest (see Section 1.d.). Police checkpoints are common
 on major roads and highways. High-ranking officials and other key supporters of the
 regime were exempt from these restrictions, but some reports indicate that the Gov-
 ernment removed most of these exceptions and tightened internal and border travel
 controls following the August defection of Hussein Kamel and his party. According
 to the Special Rapporteur, the regime's ability to secure a voter turnout of over 99
 per cent in the October "referendum" demonstrated the regime's ability to control
 the movement of citizens in the country (see Section 3).
 The Government requires citizens to obtain expensive exit visas for foreign travel.
 Citizens may not make more than two trips abroad annually. The Government re-
 portedly prohibits some citizens from all international travel. Before traveling
 abroad, citizens are required to post collateral with the Government which is re-
 fundable only upon their return to Iraq. There are restrictions on the amount of cur-
 rency that maybe taken out of the country. Women are not permitted to travel out-
 side Iraq alone; male relatives must escort them.
 Students abroad who refuse to return to Iraq are required to reimburse any of
 their expenses that were paid by the Government. Each student wishing to travel
 abroad must provide a guarantor. The guarantor and the student's parents may be
 liable if the student fails to return.
 Foreign spouses of citizens who have resided in Iraq for 5 years are required to
 apply for nationality. The requirement is 1 year of residence for the spouses of citi-
 zens employed in government offices. Many foreigners thus have been obliged to ac-
 cept citizenship and are subject to official travel restrictions. The penalties for non-
 compliance include, but are not limited to, loss of the spouse's job, a substantial fi-
 nancial penalty, and repayment for any governmental educational expenses.
 The Government prevents many citizens who also hold citizenship in another
 country--especially the children of Iraqi fathers and foreign-born mothers-from
 visiting the country of their other nationality.
 The Government continued to pursue its discriminatory resettlement policies, in-
 cluding demolition of villages and forced relocation of Kurds, Turcomans, Assyrians,
 
 
 1168
 and other minorities. Human rights monitors reported that the Government contin-
 ues to force Kurdish and Turcoman residents of Mosul and Kirkuk to move to other
 areas in the north or the south.
 According to the Special Rapporteur, security forces continue to relocate Shi'a in-
 habitants of the southern marshes to major southern cities. Many have been trans-
 ferred to detention centers and prisons in central Iraq, primarily in Baghdad, or
 even to northern cities like Kirkuk as part of the Government's attempt to Arabize"
 traditionally non-Arab areas.
 Large numbers of Shi'a refugees from southern Iraq fled to Iran due to military
 operations in southern Iraq. There is insufficient information to estimate the num-
 ber of persons displaced by these operations due to the lack of international mon-
 itors in the area. It is estimated that as o? September more than 200,000 of the
 250,000 former inhabitants of the marshes had been driven from the area since
 1991 (see also Section L.a.).
 In late 1995, the UNHCR estimated that approximately 12,000 refugees from the
 marshes were in refugee camps in Iran. Amar Appeal, a charitable organization op-
 erating several of the camps, placed the number at more than 35,000 refugees.
 According to the UNHCR, hundreds of thousands of Iraqi refugees remain
 abroad-mainly in Iran, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Syria Turkey, Pakistan, and Jor-
 dan. Apart from those suspected of sympathizing with Iran, most fled after the Gov-
 ernment's suppression of the civil uprising of 1991; others are Kurds who fled the
 Anfal Campaign of 1988.
 Of the 1.5 million refugees who fled following the 1991 uprisings, the great major-
 ity, particularly Kurds, have repatriated themselves to northern Iraq, in areas
 where the allies have prohibited overflights by Iraqi aircraft. Several hundred thou-
 sand Kurds remain unsettled in northern Iraq because political circumstances do
 not permit them to return to their former homes in government-controlled territory.
 Northern Iraq is host to approximately 14,000 Turkish Kurds who have fled civil
 strife in southeastern Turkey. The UNHCR is treating these displaced persons as
 refugees until it reaches an official determination on their status. In late 1995,
 UNHCR successfully consolidated the Atrush Refugee Camp facilities to enhance
 protection and assistance for the refugees there.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens do not have the right to change their government. The only free and open
 elections have been held in northern Iraq, and those only for local officials and insti-
 tutions. Full political participation at the national level is confined to members of
 the Arab Ba'ath Socialist Party, estimated at about 8 percent of the population. The
 political system is dominated by the Party, which governs through the Revolution-
 ary Command Council (RCC), headed by President Saddam Hussein. However, the
 RCC exercises both executive and legislative authority. It overshadows the National
 Assembly, which is completely subordinate to it and the executive branch.
 The President wields decisive power over all instruments of government. Almost
 all powerful officials are either members of his family or are family allies from his
 home town of Tikrit.
 Opposition political organizations are illegal and severely suppressed. Member-
 ship in certain plitical parties is punishable by death (see Section 2.b.). In 1991
 the RCC adopted a law tat theoretically authorized the creation of political parties
 other than the Ba'ath; in practice the law is used to prohibit parties that do not
 support Saddam Hussein and the current Government. New parties must be based
 in iaghdad and ame prohibited from having any ethnic or religious character.
 The Government does not recognize the various political groupings and parties
 that have been formed by Shi'a Muslims, as well as Kurdish, Assyrian, Turcoman,
 and other Iraqi communities. These political groups continued to attract support
 notwithstanding their illegal status.
 In northern Iraq, all central government functions have been performed by local
 administrators, mainly Kurd, since the Government withdrew its military forces
 and civilian administrative personnel from the area after the 1991 uprising. A re-
 gional parliament and local government administrators were elected in 1992. This
 parliament last met in May 1995. Discussions among Kurdish and other northern
 Iraqi pitical groups continue on the reconvening of parliament, but the tensions
 between the PUK and KDP continue to preventparliamentary activity.
 The Government's October 15 "referendum    on Saddam's presidency was not
 democratic. Citizens were given a choice of voting for or against an extension of Sad-
 dam Hussein's rule for 7 years. No other candidates or questions were included on
 the ballot, nor were there any political debates or campaigns. Voters were obligated
 to identify themselves on theirballots. Over 99 per cent of the electorate reportedly
 
 
 1169
 voted, and Saddam received 99.96 per cent approved the extension of his presidency.
 The Special Rapporteur and human rights groups noted that the denial of a secret
 ballot, as well as fears of reprisal for a negative vote, invalidated any claim that
 the referendum was democratic.
 The law provides for the election of women and minorities to the National Assem-
 bly, but they have only token representation.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The Government does not permit the establishment of independent human rights
 organizations. It operates an official human rights group which routinely denies al-
 legations of abuses. Citizens have established several human rights groups abroad
 and in northern areas not under government control.
 As in 1994, the Government did not allow the U.N. Special Rapporteur to visit
 Iraq, nor did it respond to his requests for information on several cases. The Gov-
 ernment continued to defy various calls from U.N. bodies to allow the Special
 Rapporteur to visit the southern marshes and other regions.
 Tn 1995 the U.N. Human Rights Committee, the U.N. Subcommission on Preven-
 tion of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities, and the U.N. General Assembly
 all adopted resolutions condemning the Government's human rights violations. For
 the third consecutive year, the UNHRC called on the U.N. Secretary General to
 send human rights monitors to "help in the independent verification of reports on
 the human rights situation in Iraq." T7he U.N. Subcommission on Prevention of Dis-
 crimination and Protection of Minorities adopted a resolution reiterating the
 UNHRC request for the deployment of monitors. In December the U.N. General As-
 sembly once again endorsed the request of the Human Rights Commission for mon-
 itrs for Iraq. The Government has continued to defy these calls for the entry of
 monitors.
 Nevertheless, the Special Rapporteur dispatched members of his staff-in June to
 Kuwait and in July to Lebanon-to interview victims of Iraqi human rights abuses.
 The Special Rapporteur has asserted the need for further resources to carry out his
 mandate, while recalling that appropriate action on major issues like the Anfal
 Campaign are beyond the scope of his potential resources (see Section 1.g.).
 Several major human rights organizations, including HRW, released new reports
 on Iraq during the year. Other reports were issued by the Iraq Foundation and the
 Amar Appeal. Opposition organizations such as the Iraqi National Congress and the
 Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq also issued reports.
 The Govement continues to fail to accept U.N. Security Council Resolution 688,
 which insists that the Government afford immediate, unrestricted access by human-
 itarian workers to all those in need of assistance in all parts of Iraq. Throughout
 1995 the Government threatened, harassed, and assaulted employees of the U.N.
 and nongovernmental organizations working in Iraq (see Sections 1.g. and 2.a.).
 In April the U.N. Security Council passed Resolution 986, providing another op-
 portunity for the Government to sell oil in order to obtain food and other humani-
 tarian goods for distribution to the Iraqi people under U.N. monitoring. The Govern-
 ment rejected that resolution as an infringement on its sovereignty. However, a sen-
 ior-level delegation from Baghdad held an inconclusive round of negotiations with
 the U.N. Secretariat in February 1996. A second round has been scheduled for
 March. The Special Rapporteur noted in his November report that the Government
 failed to provide for the basic humanitarian needs of its civilian population, and that
 it is obligated to do so as a signatory tothe United Nations  ran   the Cov-
 enant on-Eonomic and Social Rights.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disabilify, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 Women.-Familial violence against women occurs but little is known about its ex-
 tent. Such abu , is customarily addressed within the tightly knit family structure.
 There is no public discussion of the subject, and the Government issues no statistics.
 Spousal violence constitutes grounds for divorce and criminal charges, but suits
 brought on these charges are believed to be rare. Other reports are impossible to
 obtain due to the Government's strict controls on freedoms of expression.
 The Special Rapporteur has commented on rape committed by the armed forces
 and security services (see Section 1.b.). He has noted that there is an unusually
 high percentage of women in the Kurdish areas, purportedly caused by the dis-
 appearances of tens of thousands of Kurdish men during the Anfal Campaign. The
 Special Rapporteur has reported that the widows, daughters, and mothers of the
 Anfal Campaign victims are economically dependent on their relatives or villages
 because they may not inhert the property or assets of their missing family meme-
 
 
 1170
 bers. Other reports suggest that economic destitution has forced many women into
 prostitution.
 Evidence concerning the Anfal Campaign indicates that the Government killed
 many women and children, including infants, by firing squads and in chemical at-
 tacks.
 The Government claims that it is committed to equality for women, who make up
 about 20 percent of the work force. It has enacted laws to protect women from ex-
 ploitation in the workplace and from sexual harassment; to permit women to join
 te reglar army, Popular Army, and police forces; to require education for girls-
 and to equalize women's right in divorce, land ownership, taxation, suffrage, and
 election to the National Assembly. It is difficult to determine to what extent these
 protections are afforded in practice. Reports indicate, however, that the application
 of these laws has declined as Iraq's political and economic crisis persists. Women
 are not allowed to travel outside Iraq alone.
 Chidren.--No information is available on whether the Government has enacted
 specific legislation to promote the welfare of children. However, the Special
 Rapporteur and several human rights groups have collected a substantial body of
 evidence pointing to the Government's continuing disregard for the rights and wel-
 fare of cldren.
 The Government's failure to comply with relevant U.N. Security Council resolu-
 tions has led to a continuation of economic sanctions. As a result, general economic
 and health conditions have deteriorated dramatically. Children have been particu-
 larly susceptible to the decline in the standard of living. Increases in child mortality
 and disease rates have been reported.
 The Special Rapporteur has observed that, under these circumstances, the Gov-
 ernment has special obligations to ensure that the most vulnerable groups in the
 Population have adequate food and health care. The S Edal Rajpporteur stated in
 his November report that Iraq's refusal to implement U. Secunty Council Resolu-
 tions 706, 712, and 986, which would permit the sale of oil in order to finance the
 import of humanitarian goods, has had an adverse effect on vulnerable populations,
 inclu ding children.
 In November the Special Rapporteur reported eyewitness accounts that the chil-
 dren of senior members of the Baath Party were treated to a variety of favors in
 the educational system, including privileged entrance and advancement throughout
 the system. These reports confirm others from recent emi*.rants alleging systemic
 corruption that prevents fair advancement by deserving children whose parents do
 not have the requisite political ties.
 The Special Rapporteur also reported in November that "the obvious imbalance
 between military expenditure and resources allocated to the fields of health care and
 education clearly illustrate the priorities of the Government." The Special
 Rapporteur has repeatedly observed that the ongoing bombardment of civilian set-
 tlements in the southern marshes hrs resulted in the deaths of many innocent per-
 sons, including women, children, and the elderly.
 People With Disabilities.-No information is available on the Government's policy
 towards people with disabilities.
 National/RaciallEthnic Minorities.-Iraq's cultural, religious, and linguistic di-
 versity are not reflected in the country's political and economic structure. Various
 segments of the Sunni Arab community which itself constitutes a small minority
 of the population, have effectively controlled the Government since independence in
 1932. Shi a Arabs, the overwhelming majority of the population, have long been eco-
 nomically, politically, and sociall  dsadvantaged. Like the Sunni Kurds and other
 ethnic and religious groups in the north, the Shi'a Arabs of the south have been
 targeted for particular discrimination and abuse, ostensibly because of their opposi-
 tion to the Government.
 The security forces reportedly were still encamped in the shrine to Imam Al at
 Al-Najaf, one of Shi'a Islam's holiest sites, using it as an interrogation center. The
 former Shi'a theological school in Al-Najaf, which the Government closed following
 the 1991 uprising, continues to be used as a public market. Security forces contin-
 ued to expel foreign Muslim clerics from Al-Najaf, under the pretext that the clerics!
 visas had expired.
 Kurds, who make up approximately 20 percent of the population, historically have
 suffered political and economic discrimination, despite the token presence of a small
 number of Kurds in the national Government (see Sections L.a., L.b., and 1.g.).
 Assyrians are an ethnic group as well as a Christian community (see Section 2.c.).
 They speak a distinct language-Syriac. Public instruction in Syriac, which was to
 have been allowed under a 1972 decree, has never been implemented. The Special
 Rapporteur reported continued discrimination against Assyrians throughout 1995.
 According to opposition reports, many Assyrian families were forced to leave Bagh-
 
 
 1171
 dad after they had fled to that city for safety following the regime's suppression of
 the northern uprising in 1991.
 Citizens considered to be of Iranian origin must carry special identification and
 are often precluded from desirable employment. Over the years, the Government
 has deported hundreds of thousands of citizens of Iranian origin (see Section 2.d.).
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Although Iraq is a party to the 1919 Constitution
 of the International Labor Organization (ILO), which provides for the freedom of as-
 sociation, trade unions independent of government control do not exist. The Trade
 Union Organization Law of 1987 established the Iraqi General Federation of Trade
 Unions, a government-dominated trade union structure, as the sole legal trade fed-
 eration. The General Federation is linked to the Ba'ath Party, which uses it to pro-
 mote party principles and policies among union members. It is also aflfliated with
 the International Confederation of Arab Trade Unions and the formerly Soviet-con-
 trolled World Federation of Trade Unions.
 Workers in private and mixed enterprises--but not public employees or workers
 in state enterprises-have the right to join local union committees. The committees
 are affiliated with individual trade unions, which in turn belong to the General Fed-
 eration.
 The Labor Law of 1987 restricts the right to strike. No strike has been reported
 over the past two decades. According to the International Confederation of Free
 Trade Unions, the severe restrictions on the right to strike include penal sanctions.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The right to bargain collec-
 tively is not recognized. Salaries for public sector workers (the majority of the em-
 ployed) are set by the Government. Wages in the much smaller private sector are
 set by employers or negotiated individually with workers.
 The Labor Code does not protect workers from antiunion discrimination, a failure
 that has been criticized repeatedly by the ILO's Committee of Experts.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Compulsory labor is theoretically
 prohibited by law. However, the Penal Code mandates prison sentences, including
 compulsory labor, for civil servants and employees of state enterprises accused of
 breaches of labor 'discipline," including resigning from the job. According to the
 ILO, foreign workers in Iraq have been prevented from terminating their employ-
 ment to return to their native countries because of government-imposed penal sanc-
 tions on persons who do so.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The employment of children under
 age 14 is prohibitedexcept in small-scale family enterprises. Children reportedly in-
 creasingly are encouraged to work in order to support their families, given the coun-
 try's harsh economic conditions. The law stipulates that employees between the ages
 of 14 and 18 work fewer hours per week than adults.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-Theoretically, most workers in urban areas
 work a 6-day, 48-hour workweek. Hours for government employees are set by the
 head of each ministry. In practice, the rate of absenteeism has likely increased with
 the deterioration of socioeconomic conditions.
 Working hours for agricultural workers vary according to individual employer-em-
 ployee agreements.
 Occupational safety programs are in effect in state-run enterprises. Inspectors
 theoretically inspect private establishments, but enforcement varies widely.
