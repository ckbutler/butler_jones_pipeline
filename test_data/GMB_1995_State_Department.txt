 THE GAMBIA
 The Gambia is controlled by a military government, the Armed Forces Provisional
 Ruling Council (AFPRC), which seized power in a coup d'etat in 1994. The AFPRC
 deposed the democratically elected government of Sir Dawda Jawara. Captain
 Yahya A.J.J. Jammeh, chairman of the AFPRC, remained Head of State throughout
 1995. Under Jammeh, the main decisionmaking organization is the military-con-
 trolled AFPRC. It rules by decree and declares its decrees exempt from legal chal-
 lenge.
 The Gambia National Army (GNA) reports to the Minister of Defense. The police
 report to the Minister of Interior. The National Intelligence Agency (NIA), estab-
 lished in June by government decree, reports directly to the AFPRC but is otherwise
 autonomous. The AFPRC and others were responsible for numerous serious human
 rights abuses.
 The Gambia's population of just over 1 million consists largely of subsistence
 farmers growing rice, millet, maize, and groundnuts (peanuts), the country's pri-
 mary export crop. The private sector, led by reexporting, fisheries, horticulture, and
 tourism, contracted continuously since the 1994 coup. Cuts in international eco-
 nomic assistance have worsened the economic decline.
 The Governmentes poor human rights record worsened during the year as the
 coup leaders continued to commit widespread and repeated human rights abuses.
 Citizens do not have the right to change their government. The AFPRC also ar-
 rested and detained senior government officials and members of the press. It held
 detainees incommunicado and did not acknowledge their detentions, detained armed
 forces and police personnel without charge, banned political parties, curbed political
 activities, publications, and other communications, intimidated the press, dissolved
 local governments, and revoked rights to travel and transfer funds or assets for sen-
 ior officials of the former Jawara government. The courts have traditionally been
 subject to a certain degree of executive influence. AFPRC decrees have abrogated
 due process and allowed the Government to search, seize, and detain without war-
 rant or legal proceedings. The AFPRC ordered the arbitrary arrest, firing, and re-
 tirement of government officials and civil service employees loyal to the previous
 government. Security forces have tortured detainees. Discrimination against women
 persists. While health professionals have focused greater attention on the dangers
 of female genital mutilation (FGM), this practice is widespread and entrenched.
 The AFPRC shortened the transition schedule for return to a democratic, civilian
 government from 4 years to 2 years because of pressure from the international com-
 munity, concerns over the collapse of tourism and other business activity, and in
 response to expressions of Gambian political views. It repeatedly denied its inten-
 tion to stay in power and, although delayed, has proceeded with the transition time-
 table. The National Consultative Commission has completed its work. Despite harsh
 press intimidation, a relatively free, outspoken press still exists.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-Former Minister of Interior Sadibou
 Haidara, arrested in an alleged countercoup January 27, died June 3 in prison. Al-
 though the AFPRC attributed his death to preexisting high blood pressure,
 Haidara's death is widely believed to have resulted from intentional mistreatment
 by prison authorities. While an autopsy was performed, the results were not made
 pubuic.
 On June 23, Finance Minister Ousman Koro-Ceesay's charred remains were found
 in his burned vehicle with part of his skull missing. He had attended Chairman
 Jammeh's departure from Yundum International Airport earlier that day. As with
 the Haidara case, no results of any investigations were made public. It is widely
 believed that Ceesay's death was a politically motivated killing by the AFPRC.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 In May two GNA soldiers, allegedly under the orders of the AFPRC, attempted to
 abduct Lamin Waa Juwara, former independent Niamina Minister of Parliament.
 They were unsuccessful.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 While the AFPRC did not suspend provisions of the Constitution prohibiting torture
 and other cruel, inhuman, or degrading punishment, it ignored these provisions in
 its treatment of former ministers and military and police detainees.
 Former AFPRC Vice Chairman Sabally, arrested in the alleged January
 countercoup, was detained without visitation rights at Mile 2 prison. He was widely
 
 
 102
 believed to have been tortured after his arrest, and credible reports indicate he has
 lost some of the use of his hands because of torture by electric shock.
 Conditions at Mile 2 prison are reported to be austere, overcrowded, and lacking
 in medical facilities. Prisoners are locked in their cells for more than 20 hours each
 day. Other reports indicate that the AFPRC assigned military guards to augment
 the corrections staff at the prison, and      there were credible reports of
 malnourishment, illness, and beatings of military and security detainees. In March
 military police surrounded the prison because of reports of demonstrations against
 poor food and living conditions, and long detention without trial. Women are housed
 separately.
 There was one death while under detention (see Section L.a.).
 In June the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) visited the Mile 2
 facility and reported that 33 of the original 53 detainees known to the ICRC were
 still imprisoned. According to the ICRC, at least 7 of these detainees are political
 prisoners and the other 25 were released. Since the ICRO's visit, only sporadic pris-
 on information became available. August press reports list a total of 50 detained
 military personnel. The ICRC visited again in October an d reported that conditions
 were adequate.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The AFPRC frequently and arbitrarily
 arrested military and police personnel, civil servants, parastatal stafl and media
 representatives. In Jun   e AFPRC declared by decree that the NIA would have
 the power to search, seize, detain, or arrest any individual or property without due
 process. In October the AFPRC issued a decree allowing a 90-day detention without
 charge and without writ of habeas corpus which has retroactive force.
 After promulgation of Decree 57, incidents of targeted searches and investigations
 increased. The AFPRC primarily targeted nongovernmental organizations and mem-
 bers of the press for investigation and detention. In July six employees of the Daily
 Observer newspaper were interrogated and released by NIA officers in reference to
 an advertisement in the newspaper. The NIA suspected that the advertisement was
 a coded message to trigger a mercenary takeover.
 The regime subjected prominent civilians in and out of government to lengthy sur-
 prise interrogations in uncomfortable circumstances, often lasting overnight, and de-
 tained some officials for extended periods. For example, vice president of the Gam-
 bian Bar Association Ousainou Darbo was detained incommunicado from October 15
 through November 6, when he was released unconditionally. The authorities gen-
 erally did not permit families, reporters, or other private citizens to visit military
 and police detainees. They did occasionally permit exceptional visits by detainees'
 spouses after direct petitions to the Vice Chairman of the AFPRC.
 At least 14 of those detained during the July 1994 coup remained in custody at
 year's end. The AFPRC has not provided an accounting of current detainees. Some
 of those detained after the attempted countercoup in November 1993 were granted
 amnesty; the authorities brought charges against others. Along with the military
 and police personnel in long-term detention, authorities detained an unknown num-
 ber of additional people for shorter periods, ranging from hours to 26 days.
 In the alleged countercoup attempt in January, the AFPRC arrested and detained
 an additional group of opposition figures, including Sabally and Haidara. Sabally's
 trial ended in December; he was convicted on two charges and sentenced to a total
 of 9 years' imprisonment, to be served concurrently (see Section 1.c).
 There was another wave of detentions in October. Many of those detained had ties
 to the Peoples Progressive Party. The AFPRC has not formally exiled its opponents.
 However, three senior officials of the former government, President Jawara, Vice
 President Sabally, and secretary general Janha, remain abroad under explicit threat
 of arrest and detention if they return. Other officials who were outside the country
 at the time of the coup are at similar risk.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-Although the Constitution provides for an inde-
 pendent judiciary, the courts are traditionally responsive to executive branch pres-
 sure. The judicial system comprises a Judicial Committee of the Privy Council
 (based in London), the Supreme Court of The Gambia, The Gambia Court of Appeal
 and the magistrate courts (one in each of the five divisions plus one in Banjul and
 one in Kanifing). Village chiefs preside over local courts at the village level. The
 AFPRC claimed that judicial provisions of the Constitution remained in effect, but
 it exempted its own decrees from court challenge and ignored due process with re-
 spect to arrest, detention, and trial.
 In early 1995, detention review tribunals comprised of a lawyer, a police officer,
 and a private citizen completed recommendations on the cases of military detainees.
 In most cases, the tribunal did not find enough to merit to continue the detentions.
 Tribunal action was advisory only. The AFPRC could have ordered the indefinite de-
 tention of military and police officers from the 1994 coup and countercoup.
 
 
 Since coming to power the AFPRC granted amnesty to 38 detained soldiers from
 the 1994 coup. Seven others were sentenced to 9 years' imprisonment in June for
 a November 1994 countercoup attempt.
 The AFPRC appointed a number of commissions to investigate individuals and or-
 ganizations suspected of corruption. These commissions have powers similar to that
 of a grand jury, including the authority to imprison and fine for contempt, and to
 imprison or demand bond from individuals considered likely to abscond.
 The AFPRC seized over 6,000 tons of imported rice owned by a Gambian business
 consortium. While the rice had all appropriate health documents, it was declared
 "unfit for human consumption," and summarily dumped into the ocean. The AFPRC
 neither waited for nor acknowedgedjudicial decisionmaking authority in the issue.
 Despite these incidents, the judicial system remains structurally intact and recog-
 nizes customary, Shari'a, and general law. Customary law covers marriage and di-
 vorce for non-Muslims, inheritance, land tenure, tribal and clan leadership, and all
 other traditional and social relations. Shari'a law is observed primarily in Muslim
 marriage and divorce matters. Under Shari'a, women receive half of what men re-
 ceive in inheritance. General law, following the English model, applies to felonies,
 misdemeanors in urban areas, and the formal business sector. Trials are public, and
 defendants have the right to an attorney at their own cost.
 The trial of former AFPRC Vice Chairman Sabally was conducted in a military
 court with a civilian judge at Fajara military barracks. He was charged with three
 counts of treason. This trial was closed to the public and all reports came from the
 army press office (see Section 1.d.)
 Three journalists from The Point newspaper were arrested in March and charged
 with inciting public alarm. After a trial lasting 6 months, all three were acquitted.
 Although total numbers are not available, most prisoners detained under the
 AFPRC's anticorruption campaign, or for security reasons, are political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-Existing
 constitutional safeguards against arbitrary search and seizure were abrogated as
 part of Decree 45. APPRC priorities in security matters and corruption investiga-
 tions override all constitutional safeguards. Police seized private documents and
 property without due process and placed armed guards at homes and other prop-
 erties suspected of having been acquired with embezzled or misappropriated funds.
 The AFPRC froze accounts of people under suspicion and prohibited by decree the
 transfer of their property. It denied persons under house arrest access to inter-
 national telephone service. Security officials are believed to monitor and record tele-
 phone communications.
 Because of the ban on political parties and activity, membership in political orga-
 nizations is forbidden.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech
 and press but in practice the AFPRC significantly restricted these freedoms. AFPRC
 Decree 11 prohibits political activities of all kinds, including possession and dis-
 tribution of political literature or engagg in political discourse by any other means.
 The AFPRC attempts to require dplomats to secure government approval for all
 public statements. The AFPRC used summary arrest, interrogation, and detention,
 to intimidate and silence journalists who published articles which it deemed inac-
 curate or sensitive. Six employees of the Daily Observer were arrested and ques-
 tioned in reference to an advertisement in June. Fear and government activity
 forced all the newspapers to exercise self-censorship. English, French, and other for-
 eign newspapers and magazines are available.
 The NIA began harassing two journalists from The Point following their acquittal
 in September (see Section .e.). It prevented journalist Pap Saine from leaving the
 country and instructed immigration officials to seize Saine's passport and inves-
 tigate his nationality. It later allowed Saine to leave. Non-Gambian journalists were
 also a target of NIA intimidation. Journalist Brima Ernest, a native of Sierra Leone,
 was forced into hiding for fear of deportation. He has since fled the country. Sierra
 Leonean journalist Cherno Ceesay was arrested for articles he wrote about alleged
 police beatings. He was deported.
 Although the AFPRC called for analysis and criticism of its government, it has
 on occasion carried out reprisals upon individuals who publicly criticized the Gov-
 ernment. Although there is no television station, the country receives broadcasts
 from Senegal. Private consumers also use satellite systems, but these systems are
 rare. Creation of the country's first station, which will be a parastatal organization,
 is in progress.
 Broadcasts from the one government and two private radio stations normally did
 not reach listeners in the eastern part of the country. Private radio stations simul-
 
 
 104
 
 cast news provided by Radio Gambia, the government station. Senegalese and inter-
 national radio broadcasts attract wide audiences.
 There is no university but a university extension program was established in No-
 vember, and classes were scheduled to begin in 1996. In October a teacher was
 questioned by the NIA regarding some remarks he had made to a student about the
 AFPRC.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-AFPRC Decree Four bans pe-
 litical organizations and politicalmeetings of any kind. Other kinds of assembly
 opuen tothe public require police permits, which are generally easy to obtain. The
 Government discouraged people from gathering in large groups.
 c. Freedom qf Rehgion.-The Constitution, which was partially suspended or
 modified after the AFPRC took power, and traditional laws provide for freedom of
 religion. Adherents of all faiths are free to worship without government restriction.
 d. Freedom of Movernent Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Constitution provides for freedom of movement. Freedom of move-
 ment for ordinary citizens remained unimpeded, but the authorities prohibited those
 under investigation for corruption or security charges from leaving the country. All
 civil servants and government officials must obtain permission to leave the country.
 Journalists have, in addition, been required to produce travel clearances. Former
 ministers were not allowed to leave The Gambia.
 In October there was a large influx of refugees from the Casamance region of Sen-
 egal. The Gambia continues to host approximately 2,000 Senegalese refugees, and
 the AFPRC continued to work with the Office of the United Nations High Commis-
 sioner for Refugees, the Gambian Red Cross, and other organizations in dealing
 with refugees. The Government does not force repatriation of those with a valid
 claim to refugee status.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens do not have the right to change their government. Political parties are
 banned, and the AFPRC exercises total power. The first decree issued by the
 AFPRC suspended legislative and executive sections of the Constitution, including
 provisions for Parliament and elections. The AFPRC has promised to hold elections
 by July '996.
 At one point this year, four of the 13 ministers in the AFPRC Executive Council
 (cabinet) were women. The AFPRC has appointed more women to government posts
 than the previous government.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The AFPRC indicated that international human rights concerns are not appro-
 priate for those suspected of corruption or involvement in subversion, since they are
 considered criminals. There are two organizations whose primary mandate is the
 promotion of human rights-the International Society for Human Rights (ISHR) and
 the African Centre forDemocracy and Human Rights Studies. ISHR has conducted
 training in democratic rights and civic education. In October it denounced the
 AFPRC decrees and called for their abrogation.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution prohibits discrimination against persons based on race, sex, reli-
 gion, disability, language, or social status.
 Women.-Domestic violence, including spouse abuse, is occasionally reported but
 its occurrence is reportedly not extensive. Police respond if cases are reported, and
 prosecute offenders if citizens file complaints. The media cover cases on trial.
 Shari'a law usually applies in divorce and inheritance matters. Marriages are usu-
 ally arranged, and polygyny is practiced. Women normally receive a lower propor-
 tion of assets distributed through inheritance than do male relatives.
 Although four women were appointed to the AFPRC executive council, women face
 extensive discrimination in education and employment. Females constitute about
 one-third of primary school students and roughly one-fourth of high school students.
 Employment in the formal sector is open to women at the same salary rates as
 men. No statutory discrimination exists in other kinds of employment, although
 women are generally employed in endeavors such as food vending or subsistence
 farming.
 Children.-The Government does not mandate compulsory education and second-
 ary opportunities are limited. The care and welfare of children in distress is consid-
 ered primarily a family responsibility. Authorities intervene if cases of abuse or mal-
 treatment are brought to their attention.
 
 
 105
 The practice of female genital mutilation (FGM) which is widely condemned by
 international health experts as damaging to both physical and psychological health,
 is widespread and entrenched. Up to 60 percent of females may have undergone this
 procedure in early youth. Rural women strongly support the practice of female cir-
 cumcision. In 1993 village women drove a prominent female FGM opponent from
 an upcountry village for speaking against the custom. The AFPRC has yet to take
 a position on FGM.
 Early in the year, the AFPRC deported to Senegal most of the Almudo population,
 rumored to be as large as 350 students and teachers. The situation of the Almudos,
 mostly Senegalese young male Koranic students aged 8 to 12 placed in the care of
 Koranic teachers, has elicited significant concern. These children are expected to beg
 for their food and clothing as well as to support their teachers.
 People With Disabilities.-There are no statutes or regulations requiring acces-
 sibility for the disabled. No legal discrimination against the physically disabled ex-
 ists in employment education, or other state services. Severely disabled individuals
 subsist primarily trough private charity. Less severely disabled persons are fully
 acceptedin society and encounter no discrimination in employment for which they
 are physically capable.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Labor law remains unmodified by the AFPRC re-
 gime. The Labor Act of 1990 applies to all workers, except civil servants. The Act
 specifies that workers are free to form associations, including trade unions, and pro-
 vides for their registration with the Government. It specifically prohibits police offi-
 cers and military personnel, as well as other civil service employees, from forming
 unions or striking. About 20 percent of the work force is employed in the modern
 wage sector, where unions are most active. Roughly 30,000 workers are union mem-
 bers, about 10 percent of the work force.
 The Gambian Worker's Confederation and the Gambian Workers' Union are the
 wo main independent and competing umbrella organizations. Both are recognized
 by the Government, but relations with the AFPRC were not tested.
 The Labor Act authorizes strikes but requires that unions give the Commissioner
 of Labor 14 days' written notice before beginning an industrial action (28 days for
 essential services). It prohibits retribution against strikers who comply with the law
 regulating strikes. Upon application by an employer to the Supreme Court, the court
 may prohibit industrial action that is ruled to be in pursuit of a political objective.
 The court may also forbid action judged to be in breach of a collectively agreed pro-
 cedure for settlement of industrial disputes, but unions may appeal the decision.Be-
 cause of these provisions and the weakness of unions, few strikes occur.
 Unions may affiliate internationally, and there are no restrictions on union mem-
 bers' participation in international labor activities. The country, applied in June to
 oin the International Labor Organization (ILO). It has been accepted in principle,
 tut must make modifications to its labor and employment laws. Furthermore, be-
 cause The Gambia is currently under military, not democratic, rule, it cannot be ad-
 mitted to ILO membership.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The Labor Act allows workers
 to organize and bargain collectively. Although trade unions are small and frag-
 mented, collective bargaining does take place. Each recognized union has guidelines
 for its activities specified by the appropriate industrial council established and em-
 powered by the Labor Act. Union members' wages exceed legal minimums and are
 determined by collective bargaining, arbitration, or market forces. The Labor De-
 partment registers agreements reached between unions and management after in-
 suring that the agreements are in compliance with labor law. No denial of registra-
 tion has been reported. The Act also sets minimum contract standards for hiring,
 training, terms of employment, wages, and termination of employment. The Act pro-
 vides that contracts may not prohibit union membership. Employers may not fire
 or discriminate against members of registered unions engaged in legal union activi-
 ties.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The criminal code prohibits com-
 pulsory labor, and it is not practiced.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The statutory minimum age for
 employment is 18 years. There is no compulsory education, and because of limited
 secondary school openings, most children complete formal education by age 14 and
 then begin work. Employee labor cards, which include a person's age, are registered
 with the Labor Commissioner, but enforcement inspections rarely take place. Child
 labor protection does not extend to youth performing customary chores on family
 farms or engaged in petty trading.
 
 
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work--Minimum wages and working hours are estab-
 lished by law through six joint Industrial Councils-Commerce, Artisans, Transport,
 Port Operations, Agriculture and Fisheries.
 Labor, management, and Government are represented on these councils. The low-
 est minimum wage is about $1.35 (14 Dalasi) per day for unskilled labor. This mini-
 mum wage is not adequate to sustain a suitable standard of living for a worker and
 family. Only 20 percent of the labor force, those in the formal economic sector, are
 covered by the minimum wage law. The majority of workers are privately or self-
 employed, often in agriculture. Most citizens do not live on a single worker's earn-
 igs but share resources within extended families.
 The basic legal workweek is 48 hours within a period not to exceed 6 consecutive
 days. A half-hour lunch break is mandated. In the private sector, the workweek in-
 cludes four 8-hour work days and 2 half-days (Friday and Saturday). Government
 employees are entitled to 1 month's paid annual leave after I year of service.
 Private sector employees receive between 14 and 30 days of paid annual leave,
 depending on length of service.
 The Labor Act specifies safety equipment that an employer must provide to em-
 ployees working in designated occupations. The Factory Act authorizes the Ministry
 of Labor to regulate factory health and safety, accident prevention, and dangerous
 trades and to appoint inspectors to ensure compliance with safety standards. En-
 forcement is spotty owing to insufficient and inadequately trained staff. Workers
 may refuse to work in dangerous situations and may demand protective equipment
 and clothing for hazardous workplaces.
