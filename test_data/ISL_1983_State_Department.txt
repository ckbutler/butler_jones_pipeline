 ICELAND
 Iceland is a modern democratic social welfare state with a
 parliamentary institution--the Althing--which is the oldest
 elected Parliament in the world. Iceland's highly literate and
 educated people take an active interest in politics and
 participate in high percentages in the country's regular
 elections. Iceland has no military forces or political
 security apparatus. There is a small and highly professional
 police force. Icelanders enjoy a fair and efficient civil and
 criminal justice system. Internally, Iceland's human rights
 practices are exemplary. Internationally, Iceland and
 Icelanders are strong defenders of individual human rights.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Unlawful or Arbitrary Deprivation of Life
 Politically motivated or officially sanctioned unlawful
 deprivation of life does not occur in Iceland.
 b. Disappearance
 There have been no known cases of 'disappearance' of persons.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Both law and practice in Iceland regard coercive methods and
 harsh punishment as abhorrent. Physical punishment is not
 permitted in Icelandic penal institutions. Prisons and jails
 are modern and clean; health care and diet are excellent. The
 number of prisoners confined in Iceland is numbered in the
 tens. Most are held under light security conditions, though
 somewhat stricter precautions are taken with those convicted of
 serious crimes. There are virtually no restrictions on family
 or attorney visits.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Due process of law is guaranteed in Icelandic legal codes and
 observed in practice. Habeas corpus exists and is honored.
 Any person detained by the authorities must be brought before a
 judge within 24 hours and charged or released. There is no
 preventive detention. There are no political prisoners in
 Iceland.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 A fair and public trial is a matter of course in Iceland.
 Icelandic courts are free of political control, though the
 lower court system is administered by the Ministry of Justice.
 The Supreme Court carefully guards its complete independence.
 There are no special or military courts. Right to counsel is
 guaranteed, and the state pays attorneys' fees when defendants
 cannot. Juries are not normally used, but multiple-bench
 courts are common, particularly on appeal. The small
 population and simple administrative division of the country
 allow a relatively informal administration of justice, but due
 process is rigorously observed.

 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Icelandic law, custom, and practice are based on a longstanding
 regard for the autonomy of the individual and the impropriety
 of government interference with the personal rights of
 citizens. Judicial warrants are required prior to entry into
 homes, except in cases of hot pursuit. Arbitrary intrusions by
 official bodies, political organizations, or any other
 organized group into the personal liberties of Icelanders have
 not occurred.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Restrictions on personal speech and the press are unknown in
 Iceland. The country's many newspapers are owned either
 independently or by the political parties and engage freely in
 criticism of the Government and each other. Radio and
 television broadcasting are a government monopoly. Journalists
 in radio and television are expected to be nonpartisan and to
 maintain standards of professional ethics. Public boards
 representing all political parties, as well as other interests,
 have been established by the Parliament to supervise the
 operation of state broadcasting. Censorship is applied to
 print and film materials to control public display of hardcore
 pornography or excessive violence, but there is no political
 censorship of any media.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Individuals in Iceland are free to join together formally or
 informally to promote nonviolent causes or to protest
 government policies or actions. 'An active web of voluntary
 organizations plays a large part in the social and political
 life of the country. All such organizations are free to
 maintain whatever international contacts they desire.
 The labor movement is highly organized in Iceland and permeates
 the entire work force. It is an important element in the
 development and administration of a comprehensive social
 welfare system similar to that of Scandinavia. The labor
 movement spans the political spectrum, with labor leaders
 affiliated with all the major parties active in individual
 unions, federations, and the national labor organizations.
 Labor unions are both active and influential in national
 economic and political life, and they are internally organized
 in accord with democratic norms. In 1983, the unions
 experienced a considerable setback to their traditional role as
 arbiters of national wage policy when a newly elected
 government abolished wage indexation and placed a moratorium on
 bargaining for wage increases until February 1984. These
 efforts to control runaway inflation in Iceland have been
 denounced by union leaders from opposition parties as an
 interference with free collective bargaining rights. As of
 November 1983, no organized protest actions or strikes have
 materialized, leading local political analysts to speculate
 that the trade union membership is also concerned about the
 effects of three-digit inflation on its well-being and is
 waiting to see ifthe Government's economic recovery policy
 
 
 1024
 achieves its intended effect by the end of the year. Labor's
 international contacts are limited only by the shortage of funds
 or staff time to maintain them, and are especially strong with
 Nordic regional labor bodies.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 The Lutheran Church is the established church of Iceland, and
 the vast majority of Icelanders are nominally Lutheran. There
 is complete freedom for other religious faiths. Religious
 affiliation is not a major factor in political or social life.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel,
 Emigration, and Repatriation
 Icelanders have complete freedom of movement within the country,
 and the freedom to travel abroad, emigrate, or return to Iceland
 at will.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to
 Change Their Government
 The political system in Iceland is a fully functioning
 parliamentary democracy, with a high level of individual
 participation in politics and a wide range of voluntary
 organizations and interest groups, which both represent the
 diverse political interests of the population and interact with
 the formal parliamentary structure. The last national election,
 in April 1983, resulted in the orderly transfer of power to a
 new coalition government in May 1983. Voter turnout for all
 elections is high, reflecting the nation's high level of
 literacy and voluntary involvement in public affairs. The use
 of party primaries, proportional representation in multi-member
 districts, and a cultural insistence on representation of the
 views of all parties in public matters all contribute to an
 active formal and informal political life, while also
 practically insuring the continuation of coalition governments
 in Iceland.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 There are no known allegations of human rights violations in
 Iceland. Iceland is represented on the European Human Rights
 Commission of the Council of Europe and has provided a judge to
 the European Human Rights Court. There are several human rights
 organizations in Iceland, including Amnesty International, which
 take an active interest in international human rights
 questions. Amnesty International does not comment on Iceland in
 its 1983 Report, and Freedom House rates Iceland "free.'
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 Icelanders enjoy a standard of living and the benefits of a
 social welfare state on the Scandinavian model. Per capita
 gross national product (GNP) declined during 1982 to
 approximately $9,580, mainly as a result of the depreciation of
 
 
 1025
 the local currency against the dollar, and, per capita GNP in
 real terms fell further in 1983. National policy stresses full
 employment. Education through the university level is free.
 The adult literacy rate in 1983 was 99 percent. Primary school
 enrollment ratios in 1983 were 99 percent for males and 100
 percent for females. The population in both rural and urban
 areas has access to safe water.
 The population of 236,000 is ethnically homogeneous. No forms
 of discrimination exist in the provision of services, the
 exercise of rights, or participation in public life.
 Icelanders are fiercely egalitarian. Full participation in
 political life, as elsewhere in the Western world, has
 traditionally been overwhelmingly a male preserve. In 1983,
 for the first time since 1918, a national women's list
 contested parliamentary elections, resulting in the election of
 four additional women to the Althing. Late in 1983, women*
 committee members of the predominantly rural-based Progressive
 Party served notice on that party's leadership that unless an
 increased allocation of party positions were guaranteed to
 women, they too would consider the formation of independent
 women's election lists for Progressive Party women. Iceland's
 chief of state is a woman.
 Infant mortality in Iceland is only seven per 1,000 births.
 Life expectancy at birth is 73 years for men and 79.2 for women.
