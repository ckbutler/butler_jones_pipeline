 IRAN*
 Iran is officially an Islamic Republic under the leadership of
 Ayatollah Ruhollah Musavi Khomeini. Its formal system, based
 on the Constitution approved in 1980 by popular referendum,
 follows a parliamentary pattern with a legislature and a
 president elected from among multiple candidates by universal
 suffrage. However, only candidates meeting highly restrictive
 religious and political criteria are permitted to contest
 elections, and the choice offered to voters is limited. The
 regime's hold on power is reinforced through arrests,
 executions, and other forms of intimidation.
 The regime is dominated by a political elite composed of Shi'a
 Muslim clerics who support Khomeini and of laymen aligned with
 these clerics. The regime, however, is not monolithic, and
 there are major differences on theology and on economic issues
 such as private property ownership, government versus private
 control of foreign trade, industrial policy, and strategy for
 the war with Iraq.
 The human rights situation in Iran continued to be affected in
 1987 by the Iran-Iraq war, which was increasingly
 internationalized during the year primarily as a result of
 Iranian actions. Apart from its toll of hundreds of thousands
 of casualties, the war has resulted in large-scale population
 displacement and has-had a drastic impact on the quality of
 life of all segments of Iranian society.
 Nine years after the 1979 ouster of the Shah and the advent of
 the Islamic Revolution, the Iranian regime still considers
 itself revolutionary but must grapple with the need to revive
 the economy- and operate political and social ,institutions,
 both new and old, in a productive manner. Although Iran is an
 oil-rich developing country, the disruptions of the
 revolutionary period and the war have caused serious economic
 deterioration. Inflation and unemployment remain high, and
 corruption and black market activities continue to flourish.
 Iran's human rights record in 1987 continued to show serious
 abuses. In its 1987 special report, Amnesty International
 (AI) expressed concern about the large number of executions,
 torture, arbitrary arrest and detentions, and lack of due
 process in political dissent cases.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 Reliable stat stics were not available on the number of people
 killed for political or religious reasons in 1987. Due to the
 lack of basic procedural safeguards for defendants tried in
 revolutionary courts, which handle virtually all political
 cases, most of the executions ordered each year by such courts
 amount to summary executions. It is also difficult to
 separate cases of executions for participation in violent
 activities or narcotics trafficking from executions based
 purely on the defendants' beliefs, statements, and
 *Because of the absence of a United States Missi6n in Iran,
 this report draws heavily on unofficial sources.

 IRAN
 associations, given the regime's practice of cloaking the
 latter category with charges from the former.
 The Special Representative to the U.N. C4mmission on Human
 Rights estimates that there were more than 7,000 executions in
 Iran between 1979 and.tho end of 1985. He notes that the
 number, of execution's has declined since 1984.
 Political violence was also perpetrated by opposition groups,
 including the Mojahedin-e-Khalq, which appears to be the most
 active antiregime organization in Iran. After xelocating to
 Iraq from France in mid-1986, the Mojahedin organization
 expanded..iTs -attacks and operations in Iran' against
 Revolutionary -Guards, clergy, and'members of the Government.
 b. Disappearance
 No informalon is available on the number of disappearances in
 1987.
 Although.there are some cases of long-term disappearance,
 disappearances are, for the most part, seldom permanent.
 People are arbitrarily arrested or carried off, held without
 chargej and some are summarily executed; the society, however,
 is not tightly controlled, soa persistent relative can
 usually determine who was responsible for the arrest-and
 locate the detainee.
 C. Torture.and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or'Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Stories of.torture-in Iran's prisons are rampant andcover a
 wide range of inhuman practices. Mock executions reportedly
 are a favorite method of torture, along with blindfolding and
 solitary confinement. Beatings of all kinds appear to he
 common. Allegedly, prisoners are beaten on the soles of their
 feet until they can no longer walk; others.have had damaged
 kidneys as a result of being kicked and beaten. According to
 AI, suspension by the arms or wrists is also a common form of
 torture.             -
 Torture apparently occurs in government prisons or in
 government houses in which prisoners of special interest are
 held for questioning. Presumably it takes place with the
 sanction of top officials. Many of these reports come from
 persons who themselves were in the prisons and who, in some
 cases, experienced the torture.
 The regime continues to revise Iran's civil code to conform
 more closely with its interpretation of Islamic law. In 1985
 the Government announced the development and inauguration of a
 new machine for surgical amputation of the hands of convicted
 thieves. As interpreted in Iran, this punishment consists of
 amputation of the four fingers of the right hand. There were
 subsequent.announcements of the use of this device. There are
 many reports of floggings, both as a means of torture and as a
 foroal punishment for sexual offenses. Death by stoning has
 been reinstituted as a punishment for certain crimes against
 morality.
 In its report, "Torture in the Eighties," AI expressed concern
 that torture has become a routine practice in at least some
 Iranian prisons and noted in particular two kinds of
 ill-treatment of prisoners:, the officially sanctioned
 
 
 1161
 IRAN
 punishment of prisoners by whipping, and the torture of
 prisoners held in incommunicado detention during interrogation
 to extract confessions.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, Exile, or Forced Labor
 Although arrests for expression of views critical of or
 different from those of the Government have decreased during
 the past several years, opposition to the regime itself or to
 an Islamic form of government still may lead to arbitrary
 detention. If there is a formal accusation, the charge is
 usually subversion, antiregime activities, or treason. There
 is also evidence that some persons are arrested on trumped-up
 criminal charges (for example, on drug charges) when their
 actual "offenses" are political; the lack of fair trials and
 other procedural safeguards encourage such a practice.
 According to Al, in some cases relatives of the politically
 suspect have been detained and held until the suspect is found.
 Political arrests are made by members of the Revolutionary
 Guard or, less commonly, by members of komitehs, local
 neighborhood groups which have assumed a quasi-official role.
 No judicial determination of the legality of detention exists
 in Iranian law. AI notes that there is no legal time limit on
 incommunicado detention. Suspects are held for questioning at
 local Revolutionary Guard offices or in jails. In some cases
 an Islamic clergyman is involved; in others, unidentified
 questioners, sometimes including torturers. It is unclear
 whether this questioning constitutes a trial by a-revolutionary
 court or whether it is part of the investigation process.
 Sometimes defendants are released after several hours or days,
 but the process may be repeated two or three times before the
 authorities decide the detainee is innocent or that he is
 guilty and should be jailed. Time spent in detention does not
 count toward fulfilling prison sentences.
 A number of foreigners (including one American) were arrested
 in Iran during 1987. (At least two Americans are now
 imprisoned in Iran). These foreigners sometimes appear to
 become pawns in power struggles between various leaders and
 factions, with release dependent on how long it takes for
 their usefulness in this regard to be exhausted. The Iranians
 do not regularly grant consular access to these persons, nor
 do they notify the embassies involved that their nationals
 have been detained.
 Information as to whether forced labor is used in Iran is
 unavailable.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial          ,
 Most of those arrested have a trial of some sort, and although
 so-called trials of major opposition figures have sometimes
 been telecast, no trial by a revolutionary court can be called
 fair or public. If the trial is given publicity, it-is
 generally because the prisoner has already been forced to
 confess to crimes.
 In his report of January 1987, the U.N. Special Representative
 said that he had received reports "that accused persons had
 not been informed of the charges against them, could not
 communicate with counsel of their own choosing, had no legal
 assistance assigned to them, could not examine witnesses of
 the prosecution, had sometimes not been informed of the
 verdict and the sentence handed down to them, and had been
 
 
 1162
 IRAN
 denied the right to their conviction'and sentence being
 reviewed-by ahigher'tribunal." AI believes that defendants
 in trial proceedings are presumed guilty.
 Restraints-on-arbitrary actions of the revolutionary courts
 were reportedly severely weakened in 1985 by a government
 decision to limit the review authority of the Supreme Court.
 Formerly., all cases decided-by the revolutionary Courts-were
 subject to.review by the Supreme Couft,-permitting improper
 decisions to-be overturned. ,Under the 1985 decision, however,
 the Supreme Court can only-examine those cases which are
 recommended for reviewiby the Supreme Judicial-Council, which
 consists bfithe, Chief Justice, the Prosecutor General, and
 three mullahs. The judicial system is further weakened by the'
 fact that revolutionary courts can consider cases formally
 under the jurisdiction of the civil.and criminal courts.,
 ASsignment of cases to-regular rather than revolutionary  -
 courts is.haphizard and apparentlyoccurs mainlywhen arrests
 are made by regular police. Revolutionary courts can also
 overturn the, decisions of civilian courts.
 For commbn criminalcoffenses, many elements of the       -
 prerevolutionary judicial system survive, and the-accuSed
 often.have the:right to a public trial with benefit of lawyers
 of theirown choosing, !aSsuming they can affard the fee. Even
 this judiciarysis not fdlly independent, however. Many of the
 former judges were-retired dfter thb-revolution,-and new
 judges selected.  One criterion:for new judges is grounding in
 Islarpiclawj and-poljtical'acceptability is-a requirement for
 any government positionL Favorable verdicts reportedly-can
 often be "purchased' from the-judges serving'on civil and -
 criminal courts and'to a lesser degree from judges of
 revolutionary courts.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Government is attempting~to remaketIranian s6ciety
 according to Khomeini's interpretation'of"Shi'a Islam. It
 rejects the Western distinction between a public sphere which
 the Governmentmay control and 'a sphere of private life -
 (religion,, culture, thdught; and pritate behavior) which the
 State may not properly control.- The regime defines itself as
 Islamic and-attempts to'enforce a way of life asserted to be
 Islamic.
 Since Khomeini's.eight-point decree of December 1982, Iranians
 have enjoyed somewhat greater freedom in their private lives.
 One of the eight points provided that no one had the right to
 enter private homes without a warrailt. - An'exception 'was -made
 for suspected hideouts of opposition groups. The decree did
 say that if Revolutionary Guards'entered a-home believing it -
 to be an opposition hideout and found they had made a mistake,
 they were to depart, even if they had found evidence of
 un-Islamic activitiqs'such-as the-presence of alcoholic
 beverages.* The decree also stated that mail should not be.
 opened or telephones tapped unless there was good reason to
 suspect antiregime activities. While homes are still entered,
 mail is-still opened, and phones are still tapped, these
 violations occur less frequently than in pievious years. A
 Headquarters for the Enforcement of.the'Imam's Decree was set
 up, as were.a number of provincial and local offices. These
 offices, which may still be in operation, a-e said to have
 received thousands of complaints about violations of rights of
 privacy.                           -.
 
 
 1163
 IRAN
 Special Revolutionary Guard units check on social activities.
 Women whose clothing does not completely cover the hair and
 all of the body except hands and face, or who wear make-up,
 are subject to arrest.
 Neighborhood komitehs, which originally acted as "block
 wardens," monitoring the activities of residents, seem to have
 been less active in the last few years. There have been
 efforts to disband them, and many may have, in fact,
 disappeared.
 g. Violations of Humanitarian Law in Armed Conflicts
 Iran holds an estimated 45,000 to 65,000 Iraqi prisoners of
 war (POW's). There are continuing reports of Iranian attempts
 to pressure POW's to oppose the Iraqi President and adhere to
 a revolutionary Iranian line. Former prisoners have reported
 that Iran subjects POW's to whippings, random executions and
 psychological torture.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution'states that "publications and the press may
 express ideas freely, except when they are contrary to Islamic
 principles, or are detrimental to public rights." In practice,
 most publications are controlled by the Government; independent
 publishers run the risk not only of press shutdowns and
 confiscation of publications and equipment but of arrest and
 summary punishment if they are overly critical of the regime.
 Examples of such punishments were sufficiently numerous in
 past years to retain a chilling effect. All books are required
 to be submitted to the Ministry of Islamic Guidance for
 censorship before they can be published. Publishers, authors,
 and printers also engage in substantial "self-censorship"
 before submitting books to the Ministry in an effort to avoid
 the substantial penalties, including economic losses, incurred
 when books are rejected. While there are competing newspapers
 in Iran, and officials and policies of the Government are
 often subjected to public criticism, newspapers are forbidden
 to criticize Khomeini and the concept of the Islamic republic,
 or support the right of self-determination for any ethnic
 groups in Iran. Nevertheless, some independent publishers out
 orf favor with the regime continue to survive and some books
 and pamphlets critical of the regime are published without
 reprisal.
 Foreign books, newspapers, and magazines may be imported only
 after review.
 All broadcasting facilities are government owned.
 Academic freedom has increased in the last several years, and
 universities operate under looser constraints than in the
 early days of the revolution. As part of the admissions
 process, all'Muslim students must pass examinations that
 demonstrate knowledge of the Koran and Islamic precepts. The
 relatively few Jews and Christians who enter universities
 reportedly must pass tests demonstrating khowledge of their
 respective religions. All textbooks are reviewed by
 government authorities to determine their acceptability.
 
 
 1164
 IRAN
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Although  hC (Qfns.tultOn per'mits unarmed assemblies and.
 marches tidb Y- U y do noe violate the principles of
 Islam," the only ones permitted in practice are those
 sponsored by t    overnment,. uchas Friday prayers and-
 sermons  and'pakades on 6 fficial occasions.
 The Constiution jermits political parties, groups,
 professional associations, and both Islamic and minority
 religious associations, but most independent organizations
 have either been baded, co-opted by the Government, or are
 moribund: Restrictiohs Dd freedom of speech and assembly
 discouraged tbe participation in the 1984 parliamentary
 elect iiis of any party other than the semiofficial Islamic
 RepublicanPaify'(IRP), now defunct.
 There'were until recently no legpl labor unions, although some
 unauthorized unions had been organized and were active.
 However, a new national labor union, the Islamic Union,
 reportedly was created in late 1985 under a law enacted by the
 Parliament. All economic concerns with a minimum of 50
 employees are permitted to have a. branch of. the new uni-pn,
 whose goal is said to be to protect workers' interests'and
 further -tpeir profess.pnal development. Nominally independent,
 it reportedly is controlled'by the Labor Ministry.
 It is ,alsQ believed that ther are officially :sanctioned
 "Islanfitc workers coukcils" in some factories. 'These,.however,
 are moje.ina:tluments of g6yernment control thin bddies that'
 represent sor%66rs' interests, although they have frequently
 been able to block layoffs or fixings of workers.
 In July '986,'largenumbers. of Iranian physicians, nurses, and
 chemists,,we t'on "9trike to protest proposed legislation
 enabling� the Government to take over the Iranian Medical
 Association. Mny physic5ans who took part in the strike
 report dly werehYrdssed, atrested, and beaten, !ncludin% the
 leader of the Iranian Medkcal _ssociation, who suffered a
 heart attack after ill-treatmint. The Association was.
 dissolved, and the Parliapent subsequently adopted legislation
 setting  u a new organization in which government-appointed'
 members-constituted a majority. "
 c. Freeddm of Religion
 Iran terms itelf an Islamic republic, and religion is closely
 intertwined with government. Grand Ayatollah Khomeini is
 recognized as the supreme leader, and this position is viewed
 as having iomethihg akin to divine sanction. The President
 and many other top officials are mullahs (religious leaders),
 as are the Speaker of the Parliament and nearly half the
 Parliament deputies.
 Approximately 90 percent of Iranians'are Shi'a Muslims. Aside
 from slightly over 1 percent who are non-Muslmm  (Baha'ls,
 Christians, Zoroastrians, and -Jews), the resCare Sunni
 Muslims. The'Sunnis are mostly Kurds, Arabs, Turkomans,
 Baluch, and othere thnic minorities. Their political
 influence is very limited. The Constitution declares that
 "the official religion of Iran is Islam and the sect followed.
 is Ja'fari Shi'ism," but it also states that "other Islamic
 denominations shall enjoy complete respect." Although Sunnis
 have encountered religious discrimination on the local level,
 the regime has made efforts to reduce Shi'a-Sunni antagonism.
 
 
 1165
 IRAN
 Tests of Islamic knowledge and orthodoxy, required in the early
 postrevolutionary years for public or semipublic employment,
 have been dropped on the grounds that they conflict with the
 constitutional provision that "the interrogation of people
 regarding their beliefs is forbidden." This provision is
 ignored, however, in the treatment of members of the Baha'i
 faith.
 The Bahali religion is not recognized in Iran, and since the
 revolution the Baha'is, Iran's largest non-Muslim minority
 (300,000-350,000 members), have suffered severe persecution,
 mainly government-directed and aimed at the religious
 leadership. In August 1983, the Prosecutor General issued an
 order that effectively banned all Baha'i religious activity
 and provided the legal foundation on which virtually all
 members of the faith can be charged with crimes. Baha'i
 property has been confiscated, shrines demolished, businesses
 disbanded or confiscated, and known Baha'is denied
 public-sector employment and social services. Baha'i
 marriages are not recognized. Participation by Baha'is in
 social welfare organizations is forbidden, their businesses
 are outlawed, and teaching of the faith is not permitted.
 Although the Baha'i national leaders dissolved the community's
 organizations in obedience to the Prosecutor General's edict,
 they subsequently were arrested, and at least some were
 executed.
 Many ordinary Baha'is also have been arrested. Charges are
 vague: "crimes against God," "corruption on earth," "warring
 against-God," and "Zionism" are among the most frequent. The
 real reason for the brrests seems to be advocacy of Baha'ism.
 In January 1987, approximately 500 Baha'is were released from
 jail. The National Spiritual Assembly of Baha'is in the
 United States notes that most of those released were persons
 whose jail terms were nearing completion and that many still
 are subject to prosecution. As of December 1987, approximately
 200 Baha'is remained in prison. Approximately 200 Baha'is
 have died following torture since the beginning of the
 revolutionary period; at least 5 executions occurred during
 1987.
 The small Christian, Jewish, and Zoroastrian (the pre-Islamic
 religion of Iran) populations are concentrated mainly in urban
 areas. Their religions are recognized by the Constitution,
 and they elect representatives to seats reserved for them in
 the Parliament. They are permitted to practice their
 religions, to instruct their children, and, although with a
 great deal of disruptive interference, to maintain schools.
 There continue to be reports of officially sanctioned
 discrimination against these minorities, particularly in the
 areas of employment and public accommodations, and of severe
 discrimination by the Government against Muslims who have
 converted to Christianity. Other reports indicate growing
 religious tolerance and readiness to accept employment of
 minorities in the professions. Nevertheless, Christians are
 sometimes suspected of harboring sympathies with Western
 powers, while Jews are seen as pro-Israeli and therefore a
 possible fifth column against Islam and Iran. In this
 connection, Jews are subject to travel restrictions which are
 not applied to members of other recognized religious groups.

 tave, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Iranians may travel to any part of Itan, except for the war
 zone on thea border with Iraq and, ii times of heavy fighting,

 purposes of military security. Persons may change their place

 without undue difficulty, and in recent years many who fled at
 the time of the revolution have returned and have sough ,

 Iranian passports have always been stamped "not valid for
 emigration,* but the Government does nQt make a clear  -
 distinction between legal resideDce in another country and
 emigration.-.According to the. regulations, Iranians with a -
 legal residence.outside Iran may be issued passports and -
 advance exit visas by the Iranian embassy, consulate, or
 interests section in their country of residence., Iranians who
 'have acqu rei U.S. citizenship are considered Iranian (in
 effect dual nationals) unless they have formally renounced
 their Iranian citizenship in accordance with Iranian law.
 Dual nationals have complained that the Iranian Interests
 Section in Washington will neither give them visas in their
 U.S. passports jior issue them Iranian passports and exit visas
 on the grounds that their res-idence in the U.S. is not legal
 because, according to Iranian law, they emigrated illegally.
 Although such services may. be denied, there are no known
 instances of the denial of Iranian citizenship to Iranians who
 left Iran, or to those who have remained there.
 
 
 1167
 IRAN
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 The Government of Iran is dominated by Ayatollah Khomeini and
 a group of religious leaders and their lay associates who share
 a belief in the Ayatollah as the supreme -leader of the
 revolution and in the legitimacy and desirability of a
 theocratic state based on his interpretation of Shi'a Islam.
 Citizens are not free to question or to change this theocratic
 form of government.
 The only political party represented in the Government--the
 Islamic Republican Party (IRP)--was disbanded in June 1987 at
 the request of President Ali Khamene'i (IRP Secretary General)
 and Parliament Speaker Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, and with
 the consent of Ayatollah Khomeini. The IRP was described as
 no longer needed, but its dissolution is widely believed to
 have been the result of increasing party factionalism and
 discord.
 Beginning a year after the Shah's departure, the revolutionary
 regime has held elections at fairly regular intervals for
 president, Parliament deputies, members of the Council of
 Experts (responsible for choosing Khomeini's successor), and
 members of local government councils. All.elections have been
 hard fought, generally with several candidates for every
 position. All candidates must be approved by the Council of
 Guardians, however, and only those meeting the Council's
 vaguely described political and religious criteria may run.
 In practice,.only supporters of the theocratic state are
 accepted. There has, however, been considerable diversity of
 opinion among candidates on economic and social questions.
 A presidential election was held in 1985, but the Council of
 Guardians denied certification as candidates to 51 of 54
 applicants. Only the incumbent President, Hojjatollah Ali
 Khamenei, and two fellow members of the now defunct IRP were
 permitted to run.
 The independence of the Parliament is enshrined in the
 Constitution and exists to a .large degree in practice. While
 Parliament deputies are typically allied with various powerful
 political and religious officials, they may speak and vote
 independently and may shift from one faction to another. The
 Parliament holds genuine debates, normally broadcast live on
 radio, on a wide variety of issues but not, however, including
 central issues such as the war or the fundamental character of
 the Islamic Republic. In some cases,-laws proposed by the
 Executive have been voted down.
 The Constitution provides for a Council of Guardians composed
 of 12 members: 6 clerics unilaterally appointed by Khomeini,
 and 6 lay members well-grounded in Islamic law who are
 nominated by the head of the Judicial Council subject to the
 Parliament's approval. The Council of Guardians must certify
 all bills passed by the Parliament as being in accordance with
 Islamic law and the Constitution. If bills fail to be .
 certified, they are sent back to the Parliament for revision.
 They cannot become law until passed by the Parliament and
 certified by the Council. The Council has rejected various
 important bills and portions of bills passed by the Parliament,
 including legislation on land reform, foreign trade, private
 enterprise, the press code, and reform of the civil code.

 IRAN'
 Section-4 0Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The regime in, Iran: is- disdainful -of foreign human rights
 groups, government-sponsored or, independent, and regards them
 as a Western means of interfering in the country's internal
 affairs. Aside from permitting the International Committee of
 the Red Cross (IGRC) to-visit POW camps and assist in several
 small-scale POW exchanges between Iran and Iraq over the past
 few years, Iran has allowed no visits by any humanitarian
 groups since January 1985, when a U.N.-appointed team visited
 POW camps. Since 1984 the Government has refused to allow a
 U.N. Human Rights Commi.ssion special representative to enter
 Iran td prepare his reports and has not commented on human
 rights violations submitted for consideration. There are no
 internal human rights groups.
 In October 1986, the Iranian Government announced that the
 ICRC would be permitted to visit POW camps. Since November
 1986, the ICRC has been visiting camps and interviewing
 prisoners. It has assisted in several POW exchanges between
 Iran and Iraq, and its officials visited Tehran and Baghdad
 earlier this year to discuss hunanitarian topics, including
 activities related to POWs.
 In August and November 1986,'AI sent two memoranda-to the
 Government of Iran expressing concern about torture, arbitrary
 arrest, and unfair political trials.. As Iran is a party to
 the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, AI
 also offered recommendations on Iran's penal code. There was
 no response from the Iranian Government.
 Section -5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Always the object of discriminatory practices in Iran's,
 conservative society, women have faced even more
 discrimination since the Revolution. Ultraconservative dress,
 entirely hiding the hair and. all of the body except the face
 and hands, is now a requirement for all women, regardless of
 their religion, national origin, citizenship, or diplomatic
 status. WoMen.-have been harassed, detained, or physically
 attacked if they appeared in public in clothing which official
 or self-appointed guardians of public morality deemed
 insufficiently modest. Employment opportunities for women are
 more restricted than was the case under the Shah. Women are
 legally barred from being judges. Although there are cultural
 barriers making employment in professional-level positions
 difficult to obtain, women do work as lawyers, physicians, and
 statisticians, and in other professions in both the public and
 private sectors. Two women serve as deputies in the
 Parliament.
 The Family Protection Act, passed under the Shah, was revoked
 by the ,Islamic Government and replaced by a civil code
 reflecting Islamic law. A bill passed in mid-1983 did give   -
 women the right to divorce their husbands, and regulations
 announced in 1984 substantially broadened to 12 the number of
 grounds for which a woman may seek divorce. A husband still
 may obtain a divorce without having to state a reason or go to
 court. The new marriage regulations provide for improved
 financial settlements for wives whose husbands divorce them.

 IRAN
 As noted in Section 2.c., the Christian, Jewish, Zoroastrian,
 and Baha'i minorities reportedly suffer officially sanctioned
 discrimination in a number of areas, particularly with respect
 to employment and public accommodations. Muslims who have
 converted to Christianity are similarly discriminated against.
 CONDITIONS OF LABOR
 Iranian labor law, which exempts agriculture, domestic
 service, family businesses, and, to some extent," other small
 businesses, forbids employment of minors under 12 years and
 places special restrictions on the employment of minors under
 18 and of women. Under the law, women and minors may not be
 used for hard labor or, in general, for night work. The labor
 law also establishes a 6-day workweek of 48 hours maximum
 (except for overtime at premium rates), with 1 day of rest
 (normally Friday) per week as well as at least 12 days per
 year of leave with pay and a number of paid public holidays.
 There are also legal provisions with respect to minimum wages
 and health and safety in workplaces. Given the large segments
 of the economy exempted from the labor law, the State's still
 unresolved administrative disorganization resulting from the
 revolution, the effects of the war with Iraq, and the general
 lack of labor unions which are both legal and effective, it is
 unclear to what extent the provisions of Iran's labor law
 actually affect most of the labor force. Despite the war,
 unemployment remains high, probably in the 30 percent range.
