 
 UNITED KINGDOM
 The United Kingdom plays a leading role in the develop-
 ment of democratic institutions and human rights practices.
 Its traditions of law and individual rights are widely
 recognized and respected. The British people and their
 government continually seek to maintain and improve the
 consistent high quality of human rights practices domes-
 tically and to promote higher levels internationally.
 The long traditions of the British people on matters
 of fair play, legal safeguards, and individual rights are
 brought to a test by the situation in Northern Ireland,
 where the British government strives to preserve public
 safety and combat terrorist violence within a sharply divided
 community while ensuring respect for human rights for the
 people of Northern Ireland.
 1.   Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 British law forbids mistreatment or torture of prisoners,
 and provides penalties for such abuse.
 In 1971, Ireland brought a case against the United Kingdom
 before the European Commission on Human Rights, alleging
 that British security forces in Northern Ireland were respon-
 sible for ill treatment of persons held in cases of suspected
 terrorism, especially through use of five sensory deprivation
 interrogation techniques. In this case, Ireland cited
 Article 3 of the European Convention for the Protection
 of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (to which the
 United Kingdom and Ireland are signatories), which prohibits
 torture and inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.
 After four years of investigation, the European Commission
 on Human Rights concluded that some of the allegations
 set forth in the Irish suit concerning torture and inhuman
 or degrading treatment had merit. The Irish government,
 because it had not received full satisfaction on all points
 of its case, then appealed the case to the European Court
 of Human Rights, which in a January 1978 decision rejected
 the specific charges of torture.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 During the deliberations of the European Court of Human
 Rights, the British Attorney General announced that the
 United Kingdom would not contest the Commission's adverse
 findings, but emphasized that the interrogation techniques
 under contention had been voluntarily and publicly abandoned
 in March, 1972, with substantial compensation awarded to
 those involved. He stated that these techniques would
 no longer be used, under any circumstances, by the British
 government. The Attorney General also pointed out that
 the British government was strengthening military and civilian
 
 (690)
 
 
 691
 directives against the use of.police measures which might
 be considered mistreatment or torture. The Attorney General
 emphasized the United Kingdom's intention to do anything
 reasonably possible to ensure observance of the Human Rights
 Convention. He concluded by voicing the hope that, in
 view of these actions, the Court would simply take note
 of the Commission's adverse conclusions against the United
 Kingdom and recognize the unambiguous British action in
 response to the charges brought in the Irish suit. Ireland
 did not accept a British request that the suit be dropped
 before final judgment. The Court found, at the same time
 that it rejected charges of torture, that the sensory depriva-
 tion interrogation techniques had constituted a breach
 of Article 3 of the Convention in that they amounted to
 inhuman and degrading treatment.
 In June 1978, Amnesty International issued a report of
 its mission which visited Northern Ireland from November
 28 to December 6, 1977. The mission-was primarily concerned
 with allegations of mental and physical maltreatment by
 the Royal Ulster Constabulary of persons under interrogation
 as suspected terrorists. On the basis of considering the
 cases of 78 out of the 3,444 arrested by the Constabulary
 as suspected terrorists in 1977, Amnesty International
 concluded that maltreatment had taken place "with sufficient
 frequency to warrant the establishment of a public inquiry
 to investigate it." Amnesty International recommended
 that, "for reasons relating to protection of suspects and
 police officers alike, a public and impartial inquiry be
 established to investigate the allegations of maltreatment,"
 including consideration of "the rules relating to interrogation
 and detention, admissibility of statements, and the effective-
 ness of machinery for investigating complaints against
 the police of assault during interview." Pending such
 an inquiry, Amnesty International recommended that "immediate
 steps should be taken to ensure that suspects being interviewed
 by the Royal Ulster Constabulary on suspicion of terrorism
 are protected against possible maltreatment," including
 such measures as "access to lawyers at an early stage of
 the detention."
 After publication of the Amnesty International report,
 the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Mr. Roy Mason,
 responded on behalf of the British government in the House
 of Commons on June 8. He emphasized that the British govern-
 ment was acutely aware that terrorism can present a grave
 dilemma for democratic governments, involving the striking
 of a difficult balance between effectively combatting such
 terrorist activity and maintaining the civil liberties
 of a free society. He affirmed the government's determination
 to uphold the law by all means in its power and to deal
 by due legal process with those who offend against the
 law. He stated that the British government did not authorize
 and would not condone the ill treatment of persons held
 in custody. He noted that the Chief Constable of Northern
 Ireland had pledged that such ill treatment would be dealt
 with in accordance with law, and he invited Amnesty Interna-
 tional to submit its evidence in individual cases to the
 Director of Public Prosecutions to determine whether criminal
 prosecution was warranted.  (Amnesty International subsequently
 
 
 692
 declined to submit its evidence on the ground that it had
 pledged confidentiality to its sources.) On June 16, 1978,
 the British government established an independent Committee
 of Inquiry to consider police practice and procedures in
 Northern Ireland relating to interrogation. The Committee,
 chaired by Judge H. G. Bennett, issued its detailed report
 on March 16, 1979. The report noted that one of the purposes
 of its inquiry was to ensure as far as possible that ill-
 treatment of prisoners could not take place. The Committee
 also noted that the Royal Ulster Constabulary had been
 a prime target for terrorists and that, in the course of
 its inquiry, the Committee had seen abundant evidence of
 a coordinated and extensive propaganda campaign to discredit
 the police.
 The Committee reviewed extensive evidence, including the
 records of civil complaints against police practices, the
 record of court cases (convictions and dismissals) considered
 on the basis of confessions obtained from prisoners, and
 reports of medical experts. It noted, as did Amnesty Interna-
 tional, that complaints have not been made against the
 Royal Ulster Constabulary's uniformed officers and that
 less than 500 of the Constabulary's total force of more
 than 6,000 actually engage in interrogation.
 The Committee ekamined extensive medical evidence from
 both official and independent sources. It constructed
 five categories based on the evidence reviewed: (a) "prisoners
 who complained of ill-treatment which was unlikely to leave
 physical evidence, and in whose cases medical examination
 was negative" (the largest category); (b) complaints which
 were clearly fabricated; (c) injuries that were undoubtedly
 self-inflicted; (d) injuries which could have been inflicted
 by others, yet could have been self-inflicted; and (e)
 most importantly, cases where evidence indicated "injuries
 sustained during the period of detention in the police
 office" and "inflicted by someone other than the prisoner
 himself." The British government announced in July 1979
 that this last category included 15 cases. The Director
 of Public Prosecutions confirmed an earlier decision not
 to proceed in nine of these cases, since there was not
 enough evidence to warrant a prosecution of any member
 of the Royal Ulster Constabulary. One case was still under
 consideration, and, in accordance with administrative procedure
 processing of five others was awaiting the outcome of criminal
 proceedings against the complainants.
 The Bennett Committee report lists 66 separate "major conclu-
 sions and recommendations" designed to improve the police
 interrogation system and protect prisoners against ill-
 treatment and policemen against false allegations. It
 also praised improvements already made in police procedures
 in recent years. The British government has accepted all
 of the Committee's recommendations on police practices
 and procedures, and these have been or are in the process
 of being implemented. These included, for example, closed-
 circuit TV in interviewing rooms, greater access to counsel,
 and closer supervision of interrogators by their superiors.
 On March 10, 1979, less than a week before the Bennett
 Report was made public, Dr. Robert Irwin, an official of
 
 
 the Association of Police Surgeons of Great Britain, alleged
 that 150 to 160 suspected'terrorists he had examined in
 police custody during the past three years had sustained
 ill treatment during interrogation by the Royal Ulster
 Constabulary. Speaking in Parliament on March 12, the.
 then Minister of State for Northern Ireland acknowledged
 that Dr. Irwin had reported through established channels
 on some cases of suspected ill treatment, and stated that
 all these cases had been investigated. On March 13, the
 Chief Constable of the Royal Ulster Constabulary announced
 that an exhaustive analysis of the records kept by the
 Constabulary's complaints and discipline branch showed
 that, during the past three years, Dr. Irwin had examined
 65 persons who had made complaints about their treatment
 during police custody. The Chief Constable stated that
 in only 10 cases did Dr. Irwin either agree with the complaint
 or find injuries which he believed were consistent with
 the allegations. The Chief Constable noted that, in three
 of these cases, the Director of Public Prosecutions had
 directed no prosecution against the accused police officers
 and that, in the remaining seven cases, a decision on prosecu-
 tion was awaiting the trial of the complainants.
 The problem of confinement conditions in Northern Ireland,
 particularly at the Maze prison, continued to receive public
 attention during 1979. The basic issue is whether prisoners
 convicted of "politically-motivated" crimes should be entitled
 to "special status" within the prison. Beginning in 1972,
 the British government granted "special status" to those
 serving sentences for politically-inspired violence. Immediately
 prior to this decision, prisoners who were members of the
 Irish Republican Army had engaged in a hunger strike for
 such status. All prisoners convicted of terrorist crimes
 -- Republican and Loyalist -- were thereafter put into
 segregated compounds where they wore their own clothes,
 did no prison work, and were responsible for their own
 internal discipline. In March 1976, the then Secretary
 of State for Northern Ireland announced that persons convicted
 of terrorist crimes committed thereafter would be treated
 as common criminals but that those who already had "special
 status" would be allowed to serve out their sentences accordingly.
 Loyalist and Official Irish Republican Army prisoners convicted
 after the cutoff date at first would not acknowledge the
 new rule, but then dropped their opposition. However,
 the majority of prisoners who were members of the Provisional
 Irish Republican Army or of the Irish Republican Socialist
 Party refused to acknowledge their criminal status or to
 abide by prison regulations regarding such matters as clothing,
 work routines, and personal hygiene. Prison authorities
 responded by restricting routine privileges, e.g., mixing
 with other prisoners, additional family visits and mail
 (beyond the statutory one visit and one letter per month),
 food parcels, and allocation of tobacco and reading materials,
 and denied striking prisoners any "remission" of sentences
 (normally one day off for each day of good behavior).
 Exercise is not forfeited as punishment and can be taken
 without clothes or in underclothes if the weather permits,
 but cannot be taken wearing only the prison issue blanket.
 In practice, protesting prisoners have refused to take
 exercise unless clothed with the blanket. Despite the
 protests and the publicity generated by them, the British
 government has declined to reinstitute "special status."
 
 
 This position is supported by Parliament and both major
 political parties. Prison authorities routinely rotate
 prisoners to clean cells to reduce the risks from unhygienic
 conditions, which, as they point out, are created solely
 by the actions of the prisoners themselves.
 c. Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 Under the "Criminal Justice Act, 1967," police are empowered
 to make arrests for a list of defined "arrestable offenses."
 Procedures for habeas corpus, bail, and suits for false
 imprisonment are routinely available in the United Kingdom.
 The absence of a written constitution and the supremacy
 of Parliament allow for the suspension of individual rights
 on a temporary basis. Continuing violence in Northern
 Ireland has presented the government with a serious problem
 of protecting the rights and safety of the province's popula-
 tion as a whole. Acting on the premise that the fundamental
 "right to life" was in serious jeopardy in Northern Ireland,
 the British government proposed and Parliament adopted
 two acts to deal with the threat: the Northern Ireland
 (Emergency Provisions) Act of 1973, which is applicable
 only to Northern Ireland, and the Prevention of Terrorism
 (Temporary Provisions) Act of 1976, which is applicable
 to the entire United Kingdom. Although both these acts
 empower the restriction of personal liberties, they are
 subject to parliamentary review and to mandatory renewal
 at frequent intervals. They were renewed by Parliament
 in 1979. Detention without trial under the 1973 Act was
 discontinued in December 1975, although that provision
 of the Act remains in force. In its September 1976 report,
 the European Commission on Human Rights found that such
 detention had been justified as "strictly required by the
 exigencies of the situation" under Article 15(i) of the
 European Convention on Human Rights. The European Court
 of Human Rights upheld this view in its January 1978 decision.
 The 1973 Act permits other exceptions to normal British
 legal practice, including non-jury trials in cases of terrorist
 offenses, because of the likelihood of intimidation of
 jurors, and search without warrant in cases of suspected
 terrorism. The Act also empowers police to arrest without
 warrant a person suspected of involvement in terrorism
 and to detain him or her up to 72 hours on their own authority.
 The 1976 Act allows such detention for 48 hours but also
 provides that suspected terrorists can be held for up to
 seven days on specific authorization by the Secretary of
 State for Northern Ireland. Under the 1973 Act, members
 of the armed forces on duty may also arrest suspected terrorists
 without warrant and hold them for up to four hours, after
 which they must be transferred to police custody. There
 have been no allegations that these limits have been exceeded
 by the police or the armed forces.
 In February 1979, the Northern Ireland Standing Advisory
 Commission on Human Rights announced, in its fourth (1977-
 1978) annual report to the Secretary of State for Northern
 Ireland, that, during the next two years, it intended to
 examine as its first priority the content and operation
 
 
 of emergency anti-terrorist legislation. The Commission,
 which was established under the Northern Ireland Constitution
 Act of 1973, noted that, although a principal objectivp
 of this emergency legislation is to protect the right of
 life in a context of continuing violence, it inevitably
 detracts from the free enjoyment of other rights. The
 Commission set itself the task of considering the continuing
 need for each provision of this legislation, judging how
 the security forces exercise their emergency powers, and
 assessing the effectiveness of safeguards against abuse.
 Although the Commission's recommendations are not binding
 on the British government, the Secretary of State for Northern
 Ireland is required by law to present them to both Houses
 of Parliament.
 d. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The British judicial system is one of the most refined
 in the world. Fair trial is guaranteed by law and observed
 in practice. All criminal proceedings are conducted in
 public, with the exception of cases involving public security
 (under the Official Secrets Acts), cases heard in the juvenile
 courts, from which the public, but not the press, are excluded
 (Children and Young Persons Act of 1933), and cases in
 which, on the ground of public decency, the judge has discre-
 tion to close the court while evidence of a particularly
 intimate character is being given by a child or young person.
 In the trial of charges under the Official Secrets Acts,
 the court is only closed (if at all) during the hearing
 of such parts of the trial as the judge, in his discretion,
 deems desirable; and the sentence must always be passed
 in public.
 e. Invasion of the Home
 Searches and seizures are regulated by law, and judicial
 remedies are available for abuse of these regulations.
 In some well-defined cases related to suspected terrorism,
 police officers or members of the armed forces on duty
 are permitted to enter homes without warrants where there
 is strong suspicion of wrong-doing.
 2.   Government Policies Relating to the Fulfillment of
 Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care and
 Education
 The fulfillment of basic'economic and social needs has
 been among the principal topics of British political discussion
 for generations. The United Kingdom has been a pioneer
 in the development of the welfare state, particularly since
 1945. The British national health scheme is among the
 most comprehensive in the world. British governments,
 regardless of party, have given high priority to education
 and housing, and to care for needy persons.
 The Northern Ireland economy in recent years has suffered
 from lack of growth because of its dependence on declining
 industries. There have been strong allegations over the
 years of substantial variances between the economic status
 
 
 696
 and privileges of the Protestant and Catholic communities
 in Northern Ireland. Despite British government efforts
 in recent years to redress this imbalance, the Protestant
 part of the Northern Ireland community continues to be
 more prosperous, to be on the average more highly skilled,
 and to control most of the economy. In spite of British
 efforts to attract investment, the unemployment rate in
 Northern Ireland is about double that of the United Kingdom
 as a whole, and this burden falls disproportionately on
 the Catholic population. In an effort to improve the lot
 of the Northern Ireland community, the British government
 has put large sums of money into Northern Ireland in comparison
 with the rest of the United Kingdom. The government's
 expectation is that an improved economic situation would
 have a favorable impact on the political problem. However,
 the long-term economic prospect is still uncertain.
 3.   Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 Personal liberty and freedom of speech are accepted parts
 of the British way of life. There is no formal bill of
 rights. However, these freedoms are well established by
 history, custom, and tradition. The safeguards for this
 system lie in representative government, in the power and
 the will of individual citizens to make their wishes known
 through that government, and in an independent judiciary.
 There have been occasional and well-publicized disturbances
 arising from racial frictions. However, racial discrimination
 in employment, education, training, housing, advertising,
 and provision of goods, facilities, and services is effectively
 barred by the Race Relations Act of 1976 and previous legisla-
 tion. The Commission for Racial Equality was established
 under the 1976 Act to work toward the elimination of discrimi-
 nation and to promote equality of opportunity and good
 relations between different racial groups. There is no
 major distinction between legal norms and practice in Britain
 regarding minority rights. Effective administrative and
 judicial remedies are available to those with grievances.
 Because of the large number of immigrants from the Commonwealth
 countries, immigration policy is among the subjects most
 actively discussed in the political arena. British immigration
 law is governed by successive immigration acts. The acts
 explicitly preclude discrimination on the basis of race.
 Revisions of the immigration rules proposed by the government
 in 1979 state that "immigration officers will carry out
 their duties without regard to the race, color, or religion
 of people seeking to enter the United Kingdom."
 In Northern Ireland, the British government is dealing
 with two sharply divided traditions, each with its own
 myths and stereotypes stemming from centuries of intermittent
 hostility and compounded by systematic campaigns of distortion
 and propaganda on both sides.
 The Protestant-dominated provincial government structure
 which existed from 1921 to 1972 engaged in systematic discrimi-
 nation against Catholics in politics, housing, and employment.
 However, during the period 1969-72, when violence was
 
 
 increasing, this government made great strides in passing
 legislation designed to end discrimination in all these
 areas. Further corrective legislation has been passed
 by the British Parliament since direct rule was imposed
 in 1972. The main advances in legal protection since 1969
 include: institution of universal suffrage, along with
 proportional representation in place of single-member districts,
 and abolition of voting limitations based on wealth or
 property ownership; prohibition of religious or political
 discrimination by any level of government; establishment
 of a Commissioner for Complaints to deal with grievances
 against local councils and public bodies; establishment
 of a central housing authority to meet the problem of sectarian
 discrimination in housing allocation and launching of new
 housing projects; prohibition of discrimination in employ-
 ment, and establishment of a Fair Employment Agency to
 promote equality of opportunity; and a special effort to
 recruit more Catholics into the civil service and police.
 In response to the prevailing terrorist violence in Northern
 Ireland, the British Parliament included in the Northern
 Ireland (Emergency Provisions) Act of 1973 a section prohi-
 biting membership in or support of organizations (both
 Protestant and Catholic) which are involved in terrorism.
 These organizations are specifically listed in the statute;
 this list does not include political parties, even those
 with close links to terrorist organizations. Persons prose-
 cuted under this statute are brought to trial in accordance
 with normal criminal procedures..
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel and Emigration
 There is freedom of movement, foreign travel and emigration.
 As an exception to these general principles, a person involved
 with terrorism may be prevented from travelling from Northern
 Ireland to Great Britain or vice versa. However, no one
 may be excluded from an area in which he ordinarily resides.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 This freedom is well-developed and enshrined in British
 history. The franchise is given to all persons 18 years
 of age or over for parliamentary and local elections.
 Participation in the political process -- discussion, debate,
 publication of dissenting views -- is open to all persons
 and political parties. Revision and improvement of the
 electoral system constitute a subject of continuing formal
 and informal debate.
 British law bars discrimination on the basis of sex, race,
 religion, or ethnic origin. Equal status for women is
 provided in the Sex Discrimination Act of 1975 and the
 Sex Discrimination (Northern Ireland) Order of 1976. There
 is equal opportunity for women in the professional fields;
 and, under the Equal Pay Act of 1970 (and corresponding
 legislation for Northern Ireland), women are entitled to
 equal pay with men when doing work that is the same or
 broadly similar. The Equal Opportunities Commission assists
 
 
 698
 in the enforcement of these acts. There is a separate
 commission for Northern Ireland.
 The British trade union movement is one of the most active
 and influential in the world. The right to strike is virtually
 unrestricted.
 The United Kingdom is a party to the International Covenant
 on Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant
 on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights.
 4.   Government Attitude and Record Regarding International
 and Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The British government has maintained a fully open attitude
 toward international inquiries into alleged violations
 of human rights. Britain is the host country of international
 non-governmental organizations in the human rights field,
 such as Amnesty International. There are numerous active
 national organizations in this field as well, located in
 London and throughout the United Kingdom. The British
 government is a firm advocate of measures to improve the
 human rights machinery of the United Nations.
