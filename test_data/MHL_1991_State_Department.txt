 MARSHALL ISLANDS
 The Republic of the Marshall Islands is a nation of 31 small,
 coral atolls scattered over a large area of the Central
 Pacific, comprising a total land area of about 70 square
 miles. The-population, of Micronesian origin, is estimated at
 48,000 and is concentrated primarily on Majuro and Kwajalein
 atolls. The Marshall Islands constituted part of the Trust
 Territory of the Pacific Islands, administered by the United
 States from 1947 to 1986 pursuant to an agreement with the
 United Nations. In October 1986, the Republic of the Marshall
 Islands became a sovereign, self-governing nation under the
 Compact of Free Association with the United States.
 Political legitimacy in the Marshall Islands rests on the
 popular will expressed by majority vote in accordance with a
 constitution uniquely blending British and American precepts,
 including a strong, American-style bill of rights. The
 legislature consists of the Parliament, known as the Nitijela,
 with 33 members and a Council of Chiefs (Iroij), the latter
 serving largely a consultative function on matters dealing with
 custom and traditional practice. The executive branch of the
 Government consists of the President and his appointed Cabinet,
 all of whom are elected members of the Nitijela. The President
 is elected by majority vote from among the membership of the
 Nitijela. The Constitution calls for an independent judiciary.
 Under the Compact of Free Association the United Statqs is
 responsible for defense and national security. Consequently,
 the Marshall Islands has no security forces of its own aside
 from national and local police forces, which are firmly under
 the control of the civil authorities.
 The economy depends mainly on transfer payments from the United
 States. Coconut oil and copra exports, a small amount of
 tourism, and the fishing industry generate limited revenues.
 No human rights abuses were reported in 1991.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:

 b. Disappearance
 No politically motivated disappearances or abductions were
 reported.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Torture and other cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or
 punishment are expressly forbidden by the Constitution; the
 prohibition is observed in practice.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The Constitution contains safeguards against arbitrary arrest
 and detention, and no such incidents were reported.

 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The right to a fair public trial is expressly provided for in
 the Constitution and observed in practice. There were no
 reported denials of fair public trial. In 1991 the Nitijela
 pressured a high court judge to resign because of its
 unhappiness with the way he was running a trial. Earlier in
 1990, Nitijela interference with the workings of the
 Independent Nuclear Claims Tribunal caused two of the judges to
 resign. It is unclear at this point if the court's future
 independence will be jeopardized by interference from the
 Cabinet or Nitijela.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The privacy of the home is protected by law and respected by
 the Government. There was no known instance of arbitrary
 intrusion by the State into the private life of the individual.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution provides for freedom of speech and press, and
 it is accorded in practice. There are two operating radio
 stations, one government owned and one privately owned, and one
 television station operated by the national museum.
 The country's sole newspaper is privately owned and operated by
 U.S. citizens long resident in the Marshall Islands.
 At one point in 1991 the Government, displeased with editorial
 criticism, put pressure on the privately owned newspaper by
 canceling all government printing orders, which are a major
 source of income for the company that puts out the newspaper.
 After a few weeks, the order was rescinded. The newspaper
 printed advertisements and letters to the editor from the
 opposition party during the 1991 election campaign.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Freedom of peaceful assembly and association is provided for in
 -the Constitution and observed in practice.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Free exercise of religion is provided for in the Constitution
 and observed in practice. There is no state religion. The
 majority of the population is Christian. Missionaries are free
 to seek converts and freely do so.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Citizens are free to travel within the country and abroad.
 There are no restrictions on emigration or repatriation.- There
 are no displaced persons other than those from Bikini atoll who
 left that atoll in 1946 because of scheduled nuclear testing on
 their island. Pending further rehabilitation of the environment
 of Bikini, contaminated in the tests, the Bikinians remain
 resident elsewhere in the Marshall Islands and in the United
 States.

 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 The Government of the Marshall Islands is chosen by secret
 ballot in free and open elections every 4 years. Suffrage is
 universal for men and women 18 years of age and older. Until
 the Nitijela election of 1991, political parties, when they
 existed, coalesced around a -particular political issue and then
 dissolved when the issue was resolved. However, in the 1991
 Nitijela election, a new political party was formed, the Ralik
 Ratak Democratic Party, which opposed the Government on a whole
 range of issues. The party was able to contest the election
 freely.
 In 1988 a law was passed prohibiting political activity by
 aliens. An offending alien is-subject to deportation at the
 discretion of the Cabinet. Although the law has never been
 invoked, its invocation could result in deportation without due
 process.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 While there are no official restrictions, no local
 nongovernmental organizations that concern themselves with
 human rights have been formed. There have been no reported
 allegations of human rights violations by the Government or any
 known requests for investigations,
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 The Constitution prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex,
 race, color, language, religion, political or other opinion,
 national or social origin, place of birth, family status, or
 descent. No instances of such discrimination were reported.
 Inheritance of property and traditional rank is matrilineal,
 with women occupying positions of importance within the
 traditional system. No instances of unequal pay for equal work
 or sex-related job discrimination were reported.
 Allegations of violence against women are rare and relate
 mainly to domestic conflict. Assault is a criminal offense,
 but in some cases women are reluctant to prosecute their
 spouses. Women's groups have held infrequent meetings to
 publicize women's issues and to create a greater awareness of
 the rights of women.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 The Constitution provides for the right of free association in
 general. This freedom of association is interpreted by the
 Attorney General of the Marshall Islands as allowing the
 existence df labor unions, although none has been formed yet.
 The Constitution is silent on the right to strike, and thus far
 the Government has not addressed this issue.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 There is no legislation concerning collective bargaining or
 trade union organization. However, there are no bars to the

 MARSHALL ISLANDS
 organization of trade unions or to collective bargaining.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 The Constitution specifically prohibits involuntary servitude,
 and there is no evidence of its practice.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 Marshallese law contains no prohibition on the employment of
 children. Children are not typically employed in the wage
 economy, but some assist their families with agriculture.
 fishing, and other small-scale family enterprises.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 There is a government-specified minimum wage established by
 law, and it is adequate to maintain a decent standard of living
 by local standards. There is no legislation concerning maximum
 hours or occupational safety and health.
