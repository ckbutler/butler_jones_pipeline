 LITHUANIA
 Lithuania regained its independence in 1991 after more than 50 years of occupa-
 tion by the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (U.S.S.R.). Lithuania's form of gov-
 ernment is a parliamentary democracy. The new Constitution, adopted by a popular
 referendum on October 25, 1992, provides for a popularly elected unicameral legisla-
 ture, called the Seimas, a popularly elected President, who functions as Head of
 State with considerable powers in foreign and security affairs, and a Government
 led by a Prime Minister and other ministers, appointed by the President and ap-
 p roved by the Seimas. The Government exercises authority with the approval of the
 Simas and the President. In parliamentary elections on October 25 and November
 15 (for undecided runoff contests), a majority of Lithuanians voted for candidates
 from the Lithuanian Democratic Labor Party (LDDP), the successor to the Com-
 munist Party of Lithuania, which in 1989 broke away from the Soviet Communist
 Party. International observers, including those from the Council of Europe and from
 the Ofce for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights of the Conference on Secu-
 rity and Cooperation in Europe, deemed the voting to be free and fair. The Seimas
 elected Algirdas Brazauskas, the. LDDP chairman, as its Chairman and as Acting
 President, pending the election to the newly established Presidency scheduled for
 February 14, 1993.
 The new Lithuanian security structure includes the domestic police subordinate
 to the Interior Ministry; military forces administered by the Ministry of Defense; a
 security service charged with internal security functions; and a Parliamentary De-
 fense Service responsible for the protection of the Parliament and its leaders, includ-
 ing the Head of State. According to the Constitution, the State Defense Council,
 made up of the President, the Prime Minister, the Chairman of the Seimas, the De-
 fense Minister, and the Chief Commander of the Army, addresses major security
 and defense issues. The President serves as the Commander in Chief o? the armed
 forces. The Parliament's National Security Committee exercises routine oversight of
 the military and security forces and must approve the annual defense budget. The
 Lithuanian and Russian Defense Ministers signed an agreement on September 8 for
 the complete withdrawal of Russian troops from Lithuania by August 31, 1993. De-
 spite subsequent an nouncerents from Mosow about a postponement and suspen-
 sion of troop withdrawals, Russian forces appear to be withdrawing in a regular and
 orderly fashion.
 Lithuania inherited from the U.S.S.R. a centrally planned economy that it is
 gradually transforming into a market-oriented system. A brad-based privatization
 program open to all citizens resident in Lithuania resulted in most of the housing
 stock and considerable portions of farmland as well as small businesses reverting
 to private ownership. Large industrial companies remain largely under state owner-
 ship, but they are also scheduled for eventual privatization. The Government has
 persevered in its price liberalization program.At the same time, the general eco-
 nomic decline of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), with which Lith-
 
 
 832
 uania conducted the bulk of its commerce, exacerbated Lithuania's economic difficul-
 ties, leading to severe inflation, declining per capita income and industrial output,
 material shortages, and some rationing, particularly of energy products.
 Freedom of speech, press, assembly, association, and religion are provided in law
 and respected in practice. In September 1991, the Lithuanian Parliament dissolved
 four district councils, two of which represented predominantly Polish communities,
 leading to allegations that the democratic rights of these residents were being re-
 stricted at the local government level. District council elections were held on Novem-
 ber 22 but were not definitive because voter turnout was below the legally required
 threshold of 50 percent. Another round of voting at the district level will take place
 in the spring of 1993. Ethnic Poles participated in the national elections, and six
 were elected to the Seimas, four representing the Union of Poles and two represent-
 ing other political groups. Lithuania passed a citizenship law that is fully in line
 with European standards (see Section 5). There is no evidence of state-sponsored
 discrimination against any persons residing in Lithuania.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 7. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from
 a. Political and  Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of
 extrajudicial killings by Lithuanian authorities in 1992.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of abductions or disappearances caused
 by Lithuanian officials. By early 1992, virtually all Lithuanian men who had been
 drafted into the Soviet army (including those who were forcibly inducted) had re-
 turned home.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 There were no reports that Lithuanian officials engaged in or condoned torture and
 other cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-By .law, police may detain a person for
 up to 72 hours based upon reliable evidence of criminal activity. At the end of that
 period, a warrant must be approved by a magistrate and a decision made whether
 or not'to make a formal arrest. The authorities have a total of 10 days to present
 supporting evidence. Once a suspect is formally charged, prosecutors may keep the
 suspect under investigative arrest for up to 2 months before taking him to court.
 In exceptional circumstances, investigative arrest may be extended by a further 6
 to 9 months with the written approval of the Procurator General. The right to an
 attorney, provided for in the Constitution, exists from the moment of detention.
 Two well-known political figures charged with collaborating with the Soviet-era
 Committee for State Security (KGB) were kept under investigative arrest in accord-
 ance with proper procedures. One was released on health grounds, while the other
 remained in investigative detention.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-Lithuania's judicial system consists of a two-tier
 structure of district courts and the Supreme Court, which hears appeals from the
 district courts. Court decisions are arrived at independently. The Procurator Gen-
 eral exercises an oversight responsibility through a network of local prosecutors who
 work with police investigators from the Ministry of Interior in preparing prosecution
 evidence for the courts. Jury trials are not used in Lithuania.
 A law reforming much of the structure and procedures of Lithuania's judicial sys-
 tem was passed and scheduled to take effect in November 1992. The implementation
 of the law, however, was suspended, pending completion of new civil and criminal
 procedural codes in early 1993.
 The Constitution provides defendants with the right to counsel. Public defense at-
 torneys are routinely assigned to persons charged with serious offenses. Defendants
 also have the right to hire an attorney of their choice. In practice, the right to legal
 counsel is constricted by the shortage of trained lawyers-only 340 registered law-
 yers practice in Lithuania-who reportedly find it difficult to cope with the esti-
 mated 50-percent rise in criminal cases before the courts in 1992. Outside observers
 have recommended the establishment of a public defender system to regularize pro-
 cedures for provision of legal assistance to indigent persons charged in criminal
 cases. By law, defense attorneys have access to government evidence and can
 present evidence and witnesses. Routine, written requests for evidence generally are
 honored by the courts and law enforcement agencies. No political trials are known
 to have ten place in 1992.
 Government efforts to rehabilitate persons charged with anti-Soviet crimes led to
 reports in 1991 that some people alleged to have been involved in crimes against
 humanity during the Nazi occupation were also benefitting from this rehabilitation.
 A special judicial procedure was established to examine each case to determine
 whether a crime against humanity may have been involved and whether or not the
 
 
 person was ever formally charged with such an offense. The rehabilitation of two
 persons suspected of crimes against humanity was overturned in 1992. The Procu.
 racy a ppealed to the Supreme Court to annul the rehabilitation of four other per.
 sons alleged to have committed war crimes. The cases are pending. Acting President
 Brazauskas informed a visiting delegation of holocaust experts from Israel that, as
 of early December, Lithuanian officials determined that five persons guilty of war
 crimes had been mistakenly rehabilitated since 1991.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family Home, or Correspondence.-Lithua-
 nian authorities do not monitor the corresponenoe or communications of citizens.
 With the written authorization of the Procurator General, however, law enforcement
 and national security agencies may engage in surveillance and monitoring activities
 on grounds of exceptional national security needs. The evidence collected in this way
 must be regularly submitted to a parliamentary committee for its review and ap-
 proval. Except in cases of hot pursuit or the danger of disappearance of evidence,
 search warrants signed by a procurator are required before police may enter private
 dwellings.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-Freedom of speech is widely respected. There
 is no exercise of prior restraint over either print or broadcast media and no restric-
 tion on disclosure, except in cases of national security. In early 1992, there were
 occasional complaints from the press associated with opposition groups that it had
 less access to government officials and official information than the progovernment
 press.
 Three private radio stations, including one broadcasting in Polish, began operat-
 ing in Lithuania in 1992. A commercial television station partly funded by the State
 also started limited broadcasts in Vilnius in September in addition to the two state-
 run channels.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-There are no laws thatpro-
 hibit public gatherings. During 1992 a large number of public meetings and dem-
 onstrations took place, with rightwing groups and blue-collar workers being espe-
 cially active. Members of the Polish minority organized picketing timed to coincide
 with visits by foreign dignitaries to draw attention to their concerns.
 Both the Constitution and the. 1990 Basic Law respect the right of Lithuanians
 to associate freely, requiring only that they Inform local government authorities of
 planned demonstrations. The Parliament, however, outlawed the Moscow-backed
 Communist Party in Lithuania in light of its support for the January 13, 1991, mili-
 tary crackdown and the August 1991 Soviet coup attempt. Other organizations asso-
 ciated with the Soviet occupation authorities were also banned. Some members of
 the Communist Party contributed to the formation of the Lithuanian Democratic
 Labor Party which was not banned and was the victor in the fall elections. Former
 officials of dommunist-era Lithuania were not arrested, except those charged with
 specific crimes.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-There were no restrictions on the exercise of religious
 freedom in 1992. The Government recognizes no state religion, although the Roman
 Catholic Church has the largest following in the country, and its clergy is the most
 visible in public life. Religious instruction was widely introduced in Lithuanian
 schools in 1992, but parents have the right to enroll their children in secular 'eth-
 ics" classes as an alternative. The former Jesuit College in Kaunas was reestab-
 lished and numerous Catholic Churches around the country were reopened. A Jew-
 ish culture center and museum were established in Vilnius.Protestant groups began
 roselytizing activity, organizing public prayer meetings and religious instruction.
 e Government hwi clearly expressed and practiced its opposition to the handful
 of anti-Semitic events in 1992. There is no significant anti-Semitic activity in Lith-
 uania at present, and the Government is firmy opposes to any such manifestations.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Trave Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-Under Lithuanian law, citizen and permanent residents are permitted
 free movement within, and return to, their country. There are no restrictions on for-
 eign travel, although the lack of hard currency makes such travel expensive for vir.
 tually all residents of Lithuania.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Lithuania is now a parliamentary democracy. Lithuanian election law requires
 that parliamentary elections be conducted by secret ballot. The ballots are printed
 in the Lithuanian language. Suffrage is universal. Forty political parties and asso-
 ciations are registered, of which 27 took part, either as individual contenders or in
 coalition with other groups, in the October 25-November 15 elections to Parliament.
 
 
 Of the 27 registered party, association, or coalition slates running in the elections,
 only 6 won enough votes to enter the new Parliament. International observers deter-
 mined that the national elections were free and fair.
 Seventy of the 141 parliamentary seats are proportionately mandated with the re-
 maining 71 representatives elected directly. Apaty must draw 4 percent of the na-
 tional vote to be represented in Parliament. National minority slates, however, are
 exempt from this rule. Two of the four Union of Poles representatives elected to the
 new Seimas won their seats on a proportional basis, even though the Union slate
 captured only 2 percent of the nationwide proportional vote. The other two won in
 district races. In addition, two other ethnic Poles were elected representing other
 political groups.
 The Lithuanian Democratic Labor Party (LDDP) won an absolute majority, with
 73 of the 141 Parliamentary seats. The rightwing Sajudis, the mainstream Christian
 Democratic Party, the Social Democratic Party, the Union of Poles, and one rep-
 resentative from a separate Christian Democratic grop make up the opposition.
 Marking a smooth transition of power, the new Government was constituted in
 early December. The LDDP decided to retain four of the former governing party's
 ministers, including the former Deputy Prime Minister, who was nominated as the
 Prime Minister (LUbys).
 The new Parliament, called the Seimas after its prewar predecessor, was elected
 to a 4-year term. One of its first acts was the election of LDDP Chairman Algirdas
 Brszauskas as Chairman of the Seimas and Acting President, pending direct elec-
 tions to the Presidency on February 14, 1993. According to the Constitution, the
 President appoints the Prime Minister with the concurrence of a majority of mem-
 bers of the Seimas.
 Lithuanian citizens voted on referendums in May and June: the ru-st called for
 a directly elected executive presidency; the second demanded the withdrawal of Rus-
 sian troops from Lithuania by the end of 1992. The referendum on the Presidency
 gained the support of 69 percent of those who voted. But the relatively low voter
 turnout, 57 percent, meant that the measure failed to obtain the necessary 50 per-
 cent of all eligible voters. The referendum on troop withdrawals, however, suc-
 ceeded. About 90 percent of those who voted were in favor of the measure, and 76
 percent of eligible voters cast ballots. Thus 68 percent of all registered voters sup-
 ported that referendum.
 The citizenship law of December 11, 1991, extends citizenship to persons who
 were born in the territory of the Republic of Lithuania, who were citizens prior to
 1940, as well as their children and grandchildren, and who became citizens under
 the legislation in effect prior to the new effective date of December 11 1991. All
 applications for retention, restoration, and naturalization must go throug a citizen-
 ship committee appointed by Parliament. In order to qualify for naturalization, an
 applicant: must pass a Lithuanian-language eamination; must have been resident
 in Lithuania for the last 10 years; must have apermanent job or source of income;
 and must renounce his current citizenship. Moreover, the Lithuanian-Russian
 Agreement of July 29, 1991 offered Lithuanian citizenship to Russian residents who
 had taken up residence in Lithuania as of the date of the Agreement's signing. Well
 over 90 percent of ethnic Poles, Russians, and others were ranted Lithuanian citi-
 zenship.
 There are no de jure restrictions on women a participation in politics or govern-
 ment, but for cultural or historical reasons they are underrepresented in political
 leadership positions. There are 10 women deputies in the 141-membr Seimas but
 none currently in the Prime Minister's Cabinet.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The Association for the Defense of Human Rights in Lithuania is an umbrella or-
 ganization for several small human rights groups. The Association lobbies Par-
 rament on human rights issues, and its meml~rs occasionally write articles in the
 press advocating human rights causes, although the Association is not very well
 known nor particularly active. Lithuanian authorities actively encouraged inter-
 national and nongovernmental human rights groups to tr-avel to Lithuania. The Sec-
 retary General of the Council of Europe visited Lithuania from February 16 to 19
 to investigate local human rights conditions and the status of ethnic minorities in
 preparation for Lithuania's future accession to the Council of Europe.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Ses, Religion, Language, or Social Status
 Lithuanian constitutional law prohibits discrimination based on race, sex, religion,
 or ethnic background. Non-Lithuanian ethnic groups, comprising about 20 percent
 of the population, include Russians, Poles aansaedarussansreUkrainians, iad Jews.
 
 
 835
 Minority nationalities have ready access to primary and secondary education in
 their own languages. State radio and television programs include a fair selection of
 programs in minority languages. Numerous periodicals are readily available in Rus-
 sian and Polish.
 Relations between the Lithuanian authorities and the sizable ethnic Polish com-
 munity in the southeast region of Lithuania, however remained strained. After the
 August 1991 Soviet coup attempt, the Lithuanian Pariament voted to suspend four
 district councils, two of which were located in predominantly Polish communities.
 The Parliament also suspended a county council in Snieckus (now called Visaginas)
 representing a predominantly Russian community. The charges leveled against the
 councils of Vilnius and Salcininkai districts (as well as the Snieckus county council)
 were that they acted to p reserve Soviet rule during Lithuania's independence strug-
 gle and supported the August 1991 coup attempt. Lithuanian administrators were
 appointed pending the election of new officials. In the November 22 elecions to the
 Vilnius and Salcininkai district councils, voter turnout was too low to allow for de-
 finitive results under Lithuanian election law, and new elections will be held in the
 spring of 1993. New elections to the Snieckus county council were set for February
 14, 1993. The Polish community also expressed concern that the planned consolida-
 tion of Lithuania's territorial administrative units might have the effect of diluting
 the majority status of ethnic Poles in the reorganized districts.
 Non-Lithuanians, especially Poles, have expressed concerns about the possibility
 of job discrimination arising from implementation of the lanage law, many public
 sector employees were required to attain a functional knowledge of Lithuanian with-
 in severalyears. Language-testingcommittees were scheduled to begin their work
 in the fall of 1992, but their establishment was delayed until January 1993. Hence,
 official testing of Lithuanian-language proficiency in accordance with the 1989 law
 has not yet commenced. There does not yet appear to be any documented evidence
 of dismissals based on the prvisions of this law. In addition, Lithuanian authorities
 have asserted that no one would be dismissed solely because of an inability to meet
 the lanwage requirement.
 Cntitution provides equal rights for men and women. Official policy speci-
 fies equal pay for equal work. There are, however, significant inequalities in Lithua-
 nian society based on sex. Women are underrepresented in some professions and in
 the managerial sector as a whole. Women, however, enjoy maternity and day-care
 benefits. Statistics are not available on the incidence of abuse directed at women.
 Several women's organizations were established in 1992. One, the League of Lithua-
 nian Women, includes several female parliamentary deputies who are attempting to
 introduce legislation protecting women's rights. Another organization, the Associa-
 tion of Women groups businesswomen mainly from Kaunas, the second largest city
 of Lithuania. he League's members and representatives of other groups report that
 public awareness of women's issues is still at a rudimentary stage. Abuse of women
 in the home is reportedly common, especially in connection with alcohol abuse by
 husbands, but institutional mechanisms for coping with this problem are generally
 not available. Official statistics on the incidence of abuse of women are not avail-
 able. Fledgling women's rights organizations are attempting to increase public
 awareness of women's issues.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The 1991 Law on Trade Unions and Article 50 of
 the 1992 Constitution recognize the rights of workers and employees to form and
 join trade unions. The Law on Trade Unions formally extends these rights to em-
 ployees of the police and the armed forces, although the Collective Agreements Law
 of 1991 does not allow collective bargaining by government employees involved in
 law enforcement and security-related work. On October 22, 23 of 25 Lithuanian
 trade unions formed a Joint Representation of the Lithuanian Trade Unions. The
 Lithuanian branch of the USS.R.'s All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions re-
 named itself the Confederation of Free Trade Unions before the advent of Lithua-
 nian independence. A genufiely free trade union called the Lithuanian Workers
 Union (LDS) emerged in 1990 and organized Lithuanian workers to defend their in-
 terests. The LDS now claims a dues-paying membership of 50,000, organized in 35
 regonal groupings.
 There are no restrictions on Lithuanian unions affiliating themselves with inter-
 national trade unions. The Union of Teachers (which is associated with the LDS)
 reportedly is affiliated with the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions.
 The LDS and its component organizations currently maintain loose cooperative con-
 tacts with international trade unions.
 The 1991 Law on Trade Unions and Article 51 of the 1992 Constitution provide
 for the right to strike. In February, 70 percent of workers in the public service sec-
 
 
 tor engaged in a strike to preserve their jobs. Hairdressers and photo studio opera-
 tors went on strike to protect their jobs, and scattered strikes by truck and bus driv-
 ers generally reflected dissatisfaction with the state management of their enter-
 prises. In at least three or four cases, the drivers succeeded in replacing the direc-
 tors of these firms.
 b. The Rieht to Organize and Bargain Collectively.--Collective bargaining and the
 right of unions to organize employees are protected by the Collective Agreements
 Law, although several provisions of this law reportedly hinder the establishment of
 new union organizations. According to the Collective Agreements Law, unions must
 have at least 30 founding members in large enterprises or have a membership of
 one-fifth of all employees in small enterprises to be registered. Difficulties commonly
 arise in state enterprises whose employees are represented by more than one union.
 LDS representatives charge that state managers sometimes prefer the old-style Con-
 federation of Free Trade Unions over the LDS unions as collective bargaining part-
 ners. In general, free trade union spokesmen say that managers often determine
 wages without regard to trade union wishes, except in larger factories with well-
 organized trade unions. The Government issues periodic decrees that serve as guide-
 lines for state enterprise management in setting wage scales.
 No export processing zones have yet been established in Lithuania.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Constitution prohibits forced
 labor.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-Free trade union representatives
 indicate that the mechanisms for monitoring minimum wage legislation are rudi-
 mentary. Complaints about infringements of child labor regulations generally are
 referred to local prosecutors who investigate the charges and take legal action to
 stop violations. A proposed labor inspection service responsible to the Cabinet of
 Ministers would be empowered, among other things, to enforce minimum wage regu-
 lations, but Parliament has yet to pass the necessary legislation establishing this
 service. Available evidence suggests that child labor is not a widespread phenome-
 non.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The legal minimum wage, although periodi-
 cally revised to take inflationary trends into account, is still insufficient to provide
 a worker and family a decent standard of living. These adjustments generally lag
 behind the national inflation rate which totaled approximately 800 percent in 1992.
 If enacted the labor safety bil before Parliament would set down the rights of
 workers confronted with hazardous conditions and provide legal protection for work,.
 ers who file complaints about such conditions. The Constitution provides that work-
 ers have the right to safe and healthy working conditions. Currently, however, the
 Labor Code inherited from the Soviet period provides most of the legal guidelines
 governing worker safety standards.
