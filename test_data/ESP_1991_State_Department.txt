 SPAIN
 Spain is a parliamentary democracy with a constitutional
 monarch, King Juan Carlos I. In free and open parliamentary
 elections in-October 1989, Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez was
 elected to a third term.
 The security forces are under the full control of the
 Government; allegations of human rights abuse are investigated,
 and those found guilty are punished by law. Spanish security
 services also maintain anticorruption brigades that investigate
 allegations of fraud and dishonesty within each service.
 The Spanish economy is market based, with primary reliance on
 private initiative, although there are still a sizable number
 of publid sector enterprises. Since Spain joined the European
 Community in 1986, its economy has been one of the fastest
 growing in Western Europe. Spain continues to experience high
 .unemployment, amounting to approximately 16 percent as of
 September. High unemployment is due in part to the entry of
 large numbers of people into the labor force, which has
 disproportionately affected women and youth. Actual
 unemployment is estimated to be considerably lower than the
 Government's figures indicate, due to the existence of an
 extensive underground economy.
 The fundamental rights of freedom of speech, assembly, press,
 religion, movement, and participation in the political process
 are provided for in the Constitution of 1978 and are respected
 in practice. In 1991 the principal source of human rights
 abuses continued to be the protracted campaign of terrorism
 waged by the Basque Fatherland and Freedom separatist group
 (ETA). The Government continued its efforts to bring individual
 terrorists to justice while adhering to democratic standards of
 due process and civil rights. While suspected terrorists
 arrested and charged with crimes frequently asserted that they
 were abused by police, there were no confirmed cases. The
 Government and the public gave increasing attention to the
 exploitation of the country's increasing number of illegal
 immigrants.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section I Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 There were no known political or other extrajudicial killings
 by government forces. In approximately 66 terrorist-related
 incidents from January through November, approximately 36 people
 were killed and 148 injured. The number of incidents increased
 from 1990, as did the severity of these attacks, resulting in
 more deaths and injuries. As in 1990, the vast majority of
 those killed were members of the Guardia Civil, the National
 Police, and the military. Of the 66 incidents, 54 were
 attributed to the ETA, 4 to the First of October Anti-Fascist
 Group (GRAPO), 3 to a Galician nationalist group, and the
 remaining 5 to small extremist groups in Catalonia and the
 Basque country.
 Cooperation between the Spanish and French Governments in the
 fight against the ETA led to the French Government's
 extradition of several suspected low-level ETA terrorists to
 Spain; so far, no high-ranking ETA leaders have been extradited.
 Although ETA violence increased in 1991, the Spanish authorities
 
 
 1230
 SPAIN
 scored a series of successes against the ETA, weakening key
 cells in San Sebastian and Barcelona.
 Violence from the GRAPO decreased in 1991 thanks in part to the
 arrests in late 1990 of two key members of the organization and
 several arrests in late 1991. In Catalonia, the nationalist
 group Terra Lliure (Free Land) in July renounced its use of
 violence and disbanded, vowing to achieve Catalan independence
 via political means.
 Two ranking police officers, who had been in pretrial custody
 since 1988 on charges that they organized a secret antiterrorist
 death squad (Antiterrorist Liberation Group, or GAL), were
 convicted in July, and each was sentenced to 108 years in
 prison in September. The delay in bringing the two policemen
 to trial is not unusual for a criminal case (see Section l.e.).
 b. Disappearance
 There are no claims that police or government security forces
 carried out secret arrests or kidnapings. No kidnapings for
 ransom were reported in 1991.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Although detainees charged with terrorism routinely assert that
 they are abused during detention, and similar charges are
 sometimes made by persons arrested for criminal offenses, there
 were no documented instances of police abuse during 1991. In
 April 1990, however, the ombudsman-like Office of the Defender
 of the People expressed'concern about the persistence of cases
 of alleged ill-treatment of detainees by members of the security
 forces. The Government actively investigates incidents in which
 police officers are accused of such abuses and prosecutes when
 the evidence warrants. An improved police attitude with respect
 to human rights in recent years may be attributed to this
 demonstrated willingness of the Government to punish improper
 police behavior, as well as to enhanced police training and
 discipline, publicity in the press, and concern by the police
 unions themselves with denunciations of police misconduct.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Under the Constitution, a person is free from arbitrary arrest
 and detention, and normally a suspect may not be held more than
 72 hours without a hearing. The penal code, as reformed in
 1988, permits a suspected terrorist to be held an additional 2
 days without a hearing. Exile is not practiced.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The Constitution provides for an independent judiciary and the
 right to a fair public trial. This right is observed in
 practice. Defendants have the right to be represented by an
 attorney, at state expense for the indigent. The right to be
 released on bail is guaranteed, unless the court has reasons to
 believe a suspect may flee or constitutes a serious threat to
 public safety. The law provides for an expeditious judicial
 hearing following arrest. Suspects may not be confined for more
 than 2 years before being brought to trial, unless a further
 delay is authorized by a judge. The period of pretrial custody
 may be extended up to 6 years, at the judge's discretion. In
 practice, pretrial custody generally is less than 1 year. In
 cases of petty crime, suspects released on bail may face a wait
 
 
 1231
 SPAIN
 of as long as 5 years before their trial comes up. Following
 conviction, defendants may appeal to the next higher court.
 The judicial structure comprises territorial, provincial,
 regional, and municipal courts with the Supreme Tribunal at its
 apex. The Constitutional Tribunal has jurisdiction over
 constitutional issues. The European Court of Human Rights is
 the final arbiter in cases concerning human rights.
 In September the Spanish press publicized a report by the Human
 Rights Committee of the Conference for Security and Cooperation
 in Europe on alleged abuses of the pretrial custody system in
 Spain. The report focused on the overcrowding of Spanish
 prisons and the growing number of inmates who had already served
 time equal to their probable sentences before reaching trial.
 The Office of the Defender of the People denied the report's
 allegations and pointed to a significant amount of work done in
 the areas of sanitation and education in Spain's prisons.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Constitution protects the privacy of the home and
 correspondence. Under the criminal code, government authorities
 must obtain court approval before searching private property,
 wiretapping, or interfering with private correspondence. The
 present antiterrorist law gives discretionary authority to the
 Minister of Interior to act prior to obtaining court approval
 "in cases of emergency." There have been no complaints that,
 the Minister has abused this authority.
 The Ministry of the Interior in December 1990 proposed
 legislation broadening police authority to search certain
 residences and dethin citizens without a court order. The
 proposed law raised certain constitutional questions which
 continue to be debated in the press and in the Parliament.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Freedom of speech and the press are provided for in the
 Constitution, and the Government scrupulously observes these
 provisions. Opposition viewpoints, both from political parties
 and other organizations, are freely aired and are widely
 reflected in the media. In 1990 three new private commercial
 television stations went on the air. Earlier, the only
 television stations were government owned.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 As provided in the Constitution, all groups have the right of
 free assembly and association for political or other purposes.
 This right is fully respected and freely practiced.
 c. -Freedom of Religion
 There is no state religion in Spain. Roman Catholicism is the
 predominant religion, but other religions are represented and
 function with full freedom. Adherence to a particular faith
 neither enhances nor diminishes a person's status.
 In February 1990, the Government concluded landmark accords with
 federations of Spanish Jews and Protestants which ended a state
 of official legal discrimination against the two religions.
 The accords place Protestants and Jews on an equal legal footing
 
 
 1232
 
 SPAIN
 with Catholics, except in the matter of financial support from
 the Government, which both faiths have renounced. Protestant
 and Jewish students now have the right to receive separate
 religious instruction in public schools, as Catholics do.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Spanish citizens have complete freedom to travel within and
 outside the country. The Government restricts neither
 emigration nor repatriation. The law on aliens permits
 detention of a person for up to 40 days prior to expulsion but
 specifies that the detention may not take place in a prison-
 like setting. Spain has a liberal refugee law. Generally, the
 Government grants refugee status on the recommendation of the
 United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Spain is a multiparty democracy with open elections in which
 all citizens 18 years of age and over have the right to vote.
 Spaniards elect representatives to a two-chamber federal
 Parliament as well as to provincial and local bodies. At all
 levels of government, elections must be held every 4 years.
 Elections.were held in May to elect mayors and municipal
 councils, as well as members of legislatures in 13 of Spain's
 17 autonomous regions. Opposition parties and groups take an
 active part in the political process. Candidates are drawn
 from four major national parties, three major regional parties,
 and a number of minor parties.
 Spanish politics contain an important regional element which is
 particularly strong in Catalonia and the Basque country. These
 two "autonomous communities" (similar to U.S. states) support
 several regional parties that reflect the desires of many
 Basques and Catalans to give political expression to their own
 linguistic and cultural identities. These parties advocate a
 variety of views and provide a legitimate democratic alternative
 to separatist groups that advocate achieving independence
 through terrorist violence.
 Participation of women in the political process continues to
 increase. In 1988 the ruling Spanish Socialist Workers Party
 (PSOE) instituted a quota system requiring 25 percent of its
 candidates to be women. The number of successful women
 candidates increased substantially in Spain's national
 elections in October 1989. However, uxder Spain's electoral
 system, the percentage of votes won determines the number of
 candidates elected from the party list; hence a candidate's
 place on the list is crucial in determining election. Since
 many women candidates have been placed in the lower half of the
 list, the number elected has never reached 25 percent.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Human Rights Association of Spain in Madrid is the largest
 and most respected national human rights organization. The
 association has a well-earned reputation for independence and
 objectivity. The Human Rights Institute of Catalonia in
 Barcelona offers seminars on resolving human rights issues
 through the country's legal system. The Foreign Ministry,
 through an Office of Human Rights Affairs, takes an active
 
 
 1233
 SPAIN
 interest in human rights issues internationally. The Government
 cooperates readily with international organizations
 investigating allegations of human rights abuses (such as the
 European Commission for the Prevention of Torture) and
 international nongovernmental human rights groups as well as
 with independent national groups.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 The Constitution provides for equal rights for all citizens,
 and an independent ombudsman actively investigates complaints
 of human rights abuses by the authorities.
 During the past 16 years of democracy, Spanish women have
 achieved a greater degree of equality under the law, gained
 increased access to the educational system, and entered the
 work force in larger numbers. Nonetheless, traditional
 attitudes continue to result in de facto discrimination. There
 is considerable regional variation in the extent of such
 discrimination. Since assuming power in 1982, the PSOE has
 undertaken a number of significant initiatives for women,
 including the establishment of the Women's Institute in 1983,
 which actively attempts to promote social, political, and
 economic equality. In 1991 the Women's Institute began to
 draft an update of the 1988 plan for equality of opportunities
 for women that targets several areas of concern. Although
 one-third more women (mainly those younger than 29 years of
 age) work outside the home than a decade ago, the frequency of
 such employment in Spain is still relatively low.
 The Government has continued to target sexual abuse, violence,
 and harassment of women in the workplace as areas of great
 concern. The majority of cases are probably not reported owing
 in part to the unsympathetic attitudes of some police and
 judicial personnel. However, the number of reported cases has
 continued to grow in recent years, possibly indicating an
 increased awareness among Spanish women of their right to seek
 legal redress. In 1989 Parliament passed a law prohibiting
 verbal and physical harassment in the'workplace.
 Several levels of government provide a number of institutional
 remedies, such as shelters for battered women. The Government
 also is attempting through educational programs to change public
 attitudes that contribute to violence against women. The
 Women's Institute has charged that some judges are reluctant to
 get involved in what they feel should remain a domestic problem.
 Similarly, in smaller towns some police officers have been
 reluctant to accept complaints from battered women. To deal
 with this problem, the Ministry of the Interior initiated a
 program in 1986 that created special sections within police
 departments to deal with violence against women, staffed by
 specially trained women officers. In 1991 the overall number
 of reports of rape increased as a result of new definitions of
 the act of rape elaborated in past years.
 Gypsies, a minority group representing 3 percent of the
 population, continue to suffer de facto discrimination in
 housing, schools, and jobs. Legal mechanisms exist by which
 Gypsies may seek redress, and the Government has stated its
 commitment to securing equal rights and treatment for Gypsies.
 A representative of the Gypsy community serves as special
 advisor to the Minister of Interior. Cases of discrimination
 against Gypsies by local communities received wide press
 condemnation in October and, in response, local authorities
 
 
 1234
 SPAIN
 have taken positive actions to bring peace to those communities.
 The local government in Madrid, for example, began a program to
 relocate Gypsy families living in shacks on the outskirts of
 the capital to housing projects in established communities and
 has toughened enforcement of existing antidrug laws to assuage
 fears that such relocations will increase drug-related crime.
 In 1991 Spain's human rights groups and media gave increasing
 attention to the question of human rights for the growing
 numbers of illegal immigrants from north and sub-Saharan
 Africa. The media criticized police authorities for their
 alleged mistreatment of northern and sub-Saharan Africans
 illegally in Spain, although there were no confirmed cases of
 abuse. Following an increase in deportations of illegal
 immigrants from northern Africa during 1991, Spanish
 authorities announced that they were willing to legalize the
 status of approximately 100,000 of these immigrants.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 All workers, except those in the military services, judges,
 magistrates, and prosecutors, are entitled to form or join
 unions of their own choosing without previous authorization.
 The only requisites for organizing a union are the formation of
 a group of more than two workers and registration with the
 Ministry of Labor and Social Security, which is routinely
 granted. Spain has over 200 registered trade unions. The only
 union presently in existence that is not legally registered is
 the Unified Trade Union of the Guardia Civil, which the
 Constitutional Court ruled in 1986 could not be registered as
 it purports to represent military personnel barred from
 unionization by the Constitution.
 Under the Constitution, trade unions are free to choose their
 own representatives, determine their own policies, represent
 their members' interests, and strike. They are not restricted
 or harassed by the Government and are independent of political
 parties. A strike in nonessential services is legal when it
 fulfills the requirement of 5 days' prior notice. Strikes
 affecting essential services require 10 days' prior notice and
 must respect legal minimum service requirements, which are
 negotiated between the employer and the unions. Strikes. occur
 frequently in Spain, although most are of short duration. The
 most significant strike in 1991 was held by public sector
 employees, including transportation workers, demanding a wage
 increase. The employees were successful and received the
 increase after a 4-day strike. In 1990 a magistrate declared a
 strike illegal for the first time since current legislation was
 enacted, but the decision was overturned by the Supreme Court
 in 1991.
 Spanish unions are free to form or join federations and
 confederations and affiliate with international bodies, and
 they do so without hindrance.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 The right to organize and bargain collectively was established
 by statute in 1980. Trade union and collective bargaining
 rights were extended to all workers in the public sector,
 except the military services in 1986. Public sector collective
 bargaining in 1990 was broadened to include salaries and
 employment levels, but the Government retained the right to fix
 
 
 1235
 SPAIN
 salary and employment levels if negotiations did not achieve an
 agreement. Collective bargaining is widespread in both the
 private and public sectors. Private sector collective
 bargaining agreements cover 60 percent of workers, although
 only a minority are actually union members. In July the
 Government attempted to reach a tripartite agreement with
 employers and the two major trade union confederations on a
 social progress pact to base wage increases on the rate of
 inflation and on productivity gains. However, these talks
 ended inconclusively when the union leaders withdrew from the
 meeting. Labor regulations and practices in free trade zones
 and export processing zones are the same as in the rest of the
 country. Union membership in these zones is reportedly higher .
 than the average throughout the economy.
 The law prohibits discrimination by employers against union
 members and organizers. Discrimination cases have priority in
 the labor courts. A prominent multinational company was fined
 heavily in 1991 for discrimination against union organizers.
 One practice that the unions consider discriminatory is the use
 by employers of temporary employment contracts. Around 32
 percent of the work force is employed under this type of
 contract. The unions believe that employees engaging in union
 organizing under this type of contract are frequently not
 allowed to renew their contracts. Legislation adopted in 1990
 has given trade unions a role in controlling work contracts to
 prevent abuse of contract and termination actions.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Forced or compulsory labor is outlawed in Spain and is not
 practiced. The legislation is effectively enforced.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 The legal minimum age for employment as established by statute
 is 16 years. The Ministry of Labor and Social Security is
 primarily responsible for enforcement. The minimum age is
 effectively enforced in major industries and in the service
 sector. It is more difficult to control on small farms and in
 family-owned businesses. Legislation prohibiting child labor
 is effectively enforced in the special economic zones. The
 employment of persons under 18 years of age at night, for
 overtime work, or in sectors considered hazardous by the
 Ministry and the unions is also legally prohibited.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 The legal minimum wage for workers over age 18 is considered
 sufficient for a decent standard of living. Minimum wages for
 those aged 16 and 17 are less. The minimum wage is revised
 every year in accordance with the consumer price index. A
 40-hour workweek is established by law. Spanish workers enjoy
 12 paid holidays a year and a month's paid vacation.
 Government mechanisms exist for enforcing working conditions
 and occupational health and safety conditions, but bureaucratic
 procedures are cumbersome and inefficient. Safety and health
 legislation is being revised to conform to European Community
 directives. The National Institute of Safety and Health within
 the Ministry of Labor has technical responsibility for
 developing labor standards, but the Inspectorate of Labor has
 responsibility for enforcing the legislation through judicial
 action when iifractions are found. Workers have legal
 protection for filing complaints about hazardous conditions.
