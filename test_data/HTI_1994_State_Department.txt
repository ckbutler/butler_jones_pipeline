 HAITI
 Haiti underwent profound changes in 1994. An illegal military regime, which had
 assumed power after ousting President Jean-Bertrand Aristide in a 1991 coup, re-
 tained firm control of the country for the first 9 months. During this time, the level
 of human rights abuses escalated. Meanwhile, the international community was im-
 posing additional pressures on Haiti-including a near-total economic embargo-in
 response to the military leaders' failure to abide by their agreements with the inter-
 national community in 1993 to step down from power.
 The human rights abuses during these 9 months of the de facto regime included
 political and extrajudicial killings by the security forces and their allies; disappear-
 ances; and politically motivated rapes, beatings, and other mistreatment of citizens,
 both in and out of prison. Although the Constitution places responsibility for public
 security and law enforcement on the Haitian armed forces (Forces Armees dHaiti,
 or FAd H, which include the police), under the de facto regime the FAdH and its
 
 
 421
 various affiliates completely disrupted the rule of law and used their monopoly of
 power for financial gain as well as to subjugate and abuse the populace.
 Paramilitary personnel in civilian clothes, including "attaches" and provincial sec-
 tion chiefs (the latter were a buncts to the FAd H, authorized under military regula-
 tions), both assisted the FAd'H and conducted much of the intimidation and violent
 repression. Other supporters, including a group that had emerged in 1993 as the
 Revolutionary Front for Advancement and Progress of Haiti (FRAPH), allied them-
 selves with FAd'H leadership. FRAPH consolidated its position throughout the coun-
 try in the first part of 1994, opening offices in most towns and villages, and infiltrat-
 ing poorer neighborhoods.
 The human rights monitors of the United Nations/Organization of American
 States International Civilian Mission (ICM), who returned to Haiti in late January
 after having left in October 1993, documented the ongoing state of repression and
 brought it to international attention. They were, however, themselves subject to har-
 assment and threats from the de facto authorities and their allies. After April, lack
 of security confined the ICM largely to Port-au-Prince and other main cities. The
 de facto authorities expelled the ICM in early July 1994; afterwards, other human
 rights and local organizations reported an increase in violations.
 On July 31, the United Nations Security Council (UNSC), "gravely concerned" by
 the "deterioration of the humanitarian situation in Haiti, in particular the continu-
 ing escalation of the illegal de facto regime of systematic violations of civil liberties,"
 adopted Resolution 940, which called for the formation of a multinational coalition
 to use "all necessary means" to remove the illegal regime and return Haiti's legiti-
 mate Government to power.
 On September 19, the US.-led Multinational Force (MNF) peacefully entered
 Haiti, 1 day after an accord worked out by former President Jimmy Carter, former
 Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Colin Powell, and Senator Sam Nunn, who
 traveled to Haiti and negotiated on behalf of the U.S. Government at the request
 of President Clinton. The accord required General Raoul Cedras and the military
 regime he headed to resign from power by October 15.
 Following its deployment, the MNF worked to establish a secure and stable envi-
 ronment, and it restored Haitian cabinet ministers to their Ministries. Par-
 liamentarians were able to return to their offices to work on urgent legislation, in-
 cluding an amnesty bill and a constitutionally mandated law to create a national
 police force separate from the armed forces and under the supervision of the Min-
 istry of Justice. Following the departure of General Cedras and other leaders of the
 de facto regime, President Aristide returned to Haiti on October 15, culminating the
 restoration to power of the legitimate Government. The ICM monitors also returned
 during this time.
 Parliament adopted the amnesty legislation in early October and the police bill
 in early November, as well as a law banning paramilitary forces. The Government
 worked with U.S. officials to evaluate members of the FAdu and create an interim
 public security force of 3,500, whose training included a human rights component.
 This security force was deployed throughout the country by year's end, under the
 supervision of International Police Monitors (IPM's) from over 20 nations, and as-
 sisted by police trainees. The Government also developed plans for a new police
 academy to train between 3,000 and 4,000 new civilian police in 4-month intensive
 courses beginning in early 1995. In late December, the Government announced a re-
 duction in FAd-lpersonnel from 6,000 to 3,500.
 Yearend MNF reports stated that a secure and stable environment had been es-
 tablished and that political violence had been drastically reduced. At the same time
 there was a noticeable increase in crime, primarily around the capital. By the end
 of 1994, the executive branch had promulgated the police law but not the amnesty
 bill. The mandates of all members of the Chamber of Deputies, two-thirds of the
 Senate, and most municipal offices neared an end. All three branches agreed to se-
 lect members for a Provisional Electoral Council to conduct mandated legislative
 and municipal elections early in 1995.
 Weakened first by years of government mismanagement and then by inter-
 national sanctions atr the 1991 coup, the economy deteriorated drastically in 1994,
 and the already difficult living conditions of the general populace declined even
 more. While contraband gasoline continued to enter the country, its price soared,
 limiting citizens' ability to operate their automobiles. Fuel shortages also curtailed
 public transportation, isolated far-flung towns, and reduced the availability of elec-
 tric power. On the return of President Aristide, however, the international commu-
 nity began to work with the Government to rebuild Haiti's economy. Humanitarian
 assistance programs were expanded, and programs to provide access to medical care
 continued.

 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-In the 5-month period until its ex-
 pulsion by the de facto regime on July 13, the ICM recorded 340 cases of
 extrajudicial killings and suspicious deaths. In the months following the ICM's de-
 parture from Haiti, one coalition of local human rights organizations reported 41
 extrajudicial killings for the month of July alone. Local organizations reported that
 extrajudicial killings ontinued at that rate in Augut and early September.
 Prior to September 19, military and police authorities, assisted by their civilian
 adjuncts, were responsible for several multiple killings and  seurity actions." In
 February police killed at least six young men who belonged to a political organiza-
 tion in a raid on a house in the Cite Sleil neighborhood of Port-au-Prince. Police
 sources asserted the deaths resulted from a gang dispute. 1CM monitors, however,
 found evidence of a well-planned police raid on the group. At the end of April, mili-
 tary authorities in Gonaves, who were seeking a pr-Aristide activist, opened fire
 on a wide area of beach in the slum area of Raboteau, killing as many as 26 per-
 sons. They asserted the action was in response to a terrorist attack on the police
 station, but there was no evidence of any such attack. Also in July, citizens discov-
 ered the shallow graves of 12 young men in Gressiers, near Leogane. The police as-
 serted that the 12 were car thieves killed in a gun battle, but local residents re-
 ported hearing no shots nearby, and the police did not explain the unorthodox bur-
 ial. In late June and July, the military commander in Les Cayes department insti-
 tuted a series of sweeps, allegedly seeking those responsible for an attack on the
 military post in Camp Perrin. At least five of the men the police arrested during
 these sweeps died in police custody, following reported beatings and torture.
 Attaches, FRAPH members, and armed urban bandits called "zenglendos" took
 advantage of the climate of impunity to carry out both political and criminal
 killings. Following the murder of a FRAPH member in late December 1993, uniden-
 tified terrorists set fires which engulfed several blocks in Cite Soleil, resulting in
 at least six deaths, many more missing, and hundreds left homeless. Witnesses gave
 evidence supporting FRAPH complicity. Armed civilians killed a group of four
 known Aristide supporters in a late May attack, also in Cite Soleil.
 In a high-profile incident, unknown persons shot and killed Father Jean-Marie
 Vincent, an associate of President Aristide and former activist priest, outside the
 chapter house of his order in Port-au-Prince on August 28. An ambulance and police
 investigatory team arrived within minutes, before the killing had even been re-
 ported. A week later, an unidentified gunman killed a local attorney in a drive-by
 shooting, within sight of police headquarters, allegedly because of his work on a
 prominent murder trial. The authorities, responding to intense pressure particularly
 on the Vincent murder (see Section 2.c.), claimed to have undertaken investigations
 but they made no serious effort and never announced any results.
 Through the first 9 months of 1994, residents continued to discover the bodies of
 persons killed by gunshot or machete in the streets of Port-au-Prince. Certain roads
 were particularly well-known as drop-off sites for corpses, which sometimes re-
 mained there for several days until health authorities picked them up. Given the
 complete lack of police or judicial investigation, it is difficult to determine how many
 of these were politically motivated cases, as opposed to criminal, but there is sfI
 cient evidence to support the presumption that a significant number were, in fact,
 political killings. FRAPH members or other armed civilians reportedly had seized
 some of these persons prior to the discovery of the remains. The de facto govern-
 ment not only took no action to curb political killings but even accused the ICM and
 other human rights groups of purchasing cadavers and leaving them in the streets
 to discredit the military regime.
 Political violence was dramatically reduced in the weeks after the entry of the
 MNF on September 19. While politically motivated violence continued in isolated in-
 stances, it became infrequent by early November, although there was a noticeable
 increase in common crime, particularly around the capital. In one instance, armed
 civilians attacked peaceful pro-Aristide demonstrators in Port-au-Prince with gre-
 nades on September 29, killing several people. A FRAPH attack against populist
 marchers September 30 resulted in two dead. Anti-Aristide elements remained, par-
 ticularly in remote areas, where they killed and intimidated local inhabitants in sev-
 eral instances. Neighbors beat a well-known Haitian painter to death in early Octo-
 ber, some human rights oups alleged that the assailants were attaches. The death
 of the deputy ma or of the central plateau town of Mirebalais, who was found be-
 headed in early November, may have been involved in a dispute with a local section
 chief. In incidents in both Port-au-Prince and the provinces, crowds beat-some-
 
 
 423
 times to death-individuals they named as attaches, members of FRAPH or, in two
 cases in the central plateau and northern provinces, members of the FAdH.
 The MNF also documented attacks against members of the Haitian armed forces
 and FRAPH adherents. Two opposition members of Parliament reported their
 houses were attacked during the weekend of President Aristide's return to Haiti,
 and mobs tore down police stations in several towns, including the capital. At the
 end of the year, the U.N. Secretary General reported to the UNSC that 'following
 the arrival of the MNF and the subsequent disintegration of the FAd H, the human
 rights situation has improved. Politically motivated violence and human rights
 abuses have decreased, though individual acts still occur sporadically and the 10M,
 for instance, has investigated beatings of detainees by the FAd'H. It has also re-
 ceived reports of violent attacks by former section chiefs, attaches, or alleged
 FRAPH members. Since the killing of the second deputy mayor of Mirebalais on No-
 vember 4, 1994, however, the ICM has not heard of any murder ascribed to the
 former military or paramilitary forces."
 b. Disappearance.-The ICM reported 131 cases of disappearance or "seizures"
 from January through June and human rights org anizations continued to report
 disappearances throughout the summer and until the arrival of the MNF. Histori-
 cally, those who disappear in Haiti either are never found or are found dead. There
 is credible evidence of FRAPH and attache participation in many of these reported
 disappearances. Information gathered by the ICM and other human rights groups
 as well as that uncovered in refugee case investigations, indicates that bth armed
 civilians and military personnel in civilian clothing seized people and took them to
 private 'jails" where these armed groups mistreated and sometimes killed their vic-
 tims.
 There were no reports of disappearances after the entry of the MNF.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Although the 1987 Constitution prohibits unnecessary force or restraint, psycho-
 logical pressure, orphysical brutality, the military regime and the de facto authori-
 ties largely ignored these constitutional protections, and ill-treatment remained
 widspreaduntil the entry of the MNF in September. The de facto authorities ro-
 tinely employed brutal beatings with fists and clubs, torture, and other cruel treat-
 ment on detainees. When the MNF inspected the prison in Lea Cayes, it found 40
 detainees, some of whom had beating wounds on the buttocks which went to the
 bone. The   facto authorities tolerated and condoned widespread physical abuse of
 detainees, creatinga climate of impunity which resulted in some particularly vicious
 activities. The authorities and their paramilitary adjuncts reputedly made use of the
 "disk", in which a victim is tied in a position which permits a more thorough beat-
 ing by club, and of "kalot marasa," a torture technique in which the assailant claps
 beth hands over a victim's ears simultaneously, bursting the eardrums. In the
 southwest town of Chardonnieres, the local corporal cut off the ear of an accused
 thief and carved his initials in his flesh. The authorities disciplined him--and then
 only nominally--only aftr he beated to a senior officer.
 Paramilitary assailants (and reportedly military officers in mufti) increasingly
 used rape as an instrument of intimidation. The ICM registered 52 cases ofpohiti-
 cally motivated rape from January through May, and reports continuedto   er-
 ceived after the ICM's expulsion. In some cases, the victim herself had been involved
 in some political activity. A more common pattern, however, was the use of rape or
 other sexual abuse as a means of intimidating a woman's politically active male rel-
 atives and neighbors. In some instances, assailants reportedly abused girls as young
 as 12 or 13 years of age. The majority of such rapes occurred in the slums of Port-
 au-Prince, aithough some cases were reported in the provinces.
 Prisoners and detainees suffered from a lack of the most basic hygiene facilities
 as well as from inadequate food and health care, including medical treatment for
 injuries received in custody. In most prisons, prisoners and detainees had to rely
 on family to bring food and medicine; there were many reliable reports, including
 in bth iLes Cayes and Leogane, of the authorities denying families entry for that
 purpose. The authorities routinely violated the law by detaining children together
 with adults. A nongovernmena organization (NGO) that had performed prison
 monitoring was unable to continue in 1994, after threats and attacks forced its di-
 rector into exile in late 1993. The International Committee of the Red Crss (ICRC)
 did, however, appoint a permanent representative in Haiti and was able to obtain
 permission for some monitoring from the de facto government. The 1CM monitors
 were able only occasionally to gain access to detainees, and not at all after April.
 After the M!NF's deployment, the ICRC continued to monitor prison conditions
 with a full team of delegates. Although the MNF was able to mare improvements,
 the military regime had allowed the prisons to deteriorate so much that the Aristide
 
 
 424
 Government had not been able to develop a comprehensive rehabilitation plan by
 year's end.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest Detention, or Exile.-Arbitrary arrest and detention were a
 persistent human ri Aits problem in Haiti since the 1991 coup. The ICM, in a last
 press release before its July 1994 departure, simply listed this category of violation
 at "several hundred."
 According to the Constitution, the authorities may arrest a person only if they ap-
 prehend the suspect during the commission of a crime, or if an authorized judge has
 issued a warrant. The authorities must bring the person before a judge within 48
 hours of arrest. In practice, however, soldiers and provincial officials regularly used
 arbitrary arrest and detention to intimidate the people and to extort money from
 them. The frequency of this practice makes it dicult to determine the number of
 arrests on purely political grounds, but the two were often interrelated. Provincial
 section chiefs generally knew well the members.of-local g aroots organizations and
 reportedly detained them during times of poitical tension and released them upon
 paymeat of abribe.
 Polie also sometimes arrested family members of a wanted man and held them
 to force him out of hiding. For example, police arrested 17-year-old Balaguer
 Metayer in November 1993 when they sought his brother in connection with "terror-
 ism" in the Gonaives area. Despite strng international pressure and a court order
 in Haiti, the police held the youth until August, when they abruptly released him.
 Most arbitrary arrest cases pass unnoticed outside the victim's family. In some in-
 stances, international pressure succeeded in bringing about the release of some de-
 tainees, such as Aristide supporter Gardy Leblanc in Miragoane in August and an
 approved refugee applicant in the southern town of Chantal.
 The Constitution provides for the separation of the police from the armed forces.
 President Aristide sent legislation to the Parliament to fulfill this provision by cre-
 ating a new civilian police force under the supervision of the Ministry of Justice.
 After parliamentary approval, the Government promulgated the new law on Decem-
 ber 26.
 Following the restoration of the legitimate Government by the Multinational
 Force, the international community initiated a program to create an interim police
 force meeting internationally recognized human rights standards to assume public
 security responsibilities and to seect, train, and deploy a new civilian police force.
 The program included four elements: International Polie Monitors (IPM's), an In-
 terim Public Security Force (IPSF), police trainees from the US. safe haven in
 Guantanamo, and a new police academy.
 In consultation with US. officials and human rights organizations, the Aristide
 Government evaluated former FAd'H personnel for h~uman rights abuses and crimi-
 nal activities. The nearly 3,000 personnel selected comprise the IPSF. To augent
 the IPSF, a group of 964 police trainees from the migrants in the US. safe haven
 in Guantanamo were selected and trained. Both the IPSF and the trainees--who as-
 sist them by performing routine police functions such as managing traffic-received
 training that included strong human rights components.
 At year's end, the interim police had been deployed throughout the country, under
 the direct supervision of the over 1,000 law enforcement personnel from some 20
 nations who make up the IPM1s. The IPM's are deployed to each of Haiti's districts
 in mentor the police and monitor their activities and prevent violations of inter-
 nationally recognized human rights standards.
 By December, preparations by the Haitian Government and US. officials were
 well advanced for the creation of a police training facility to build a new, profes-
 sional police force recruited openly and fairly from througout Haiti. The academy,
 which was to open at the end of January 1995, would train an initial complement
 of 4,000 police in a series of 4-month courses. These new police will replace IPSF
 personne as they graduate.
 By the end of the year, the MNF, acting under the mandate of UNSC Resolution
 940 to use all necessary means to establish a stable and secure environment, had
 detained approximately 30 persons, until such time as they could be turned over to
 a competent Haitian judicial authority for eventual disposition as may be appro-
 priate under Haitian law.
 The Constitution prohibits involuntary exile of citizens. While some have left the
 country voluntarily or personal or political reasons, the Government did not make
 use of exile as punishment.
 e. Denial of Fair Public TriaL.-The Constitution provides for an independent judi-
 ciary and the right to a fair public trial. However, this right is widely and severely
 abridged, primarily because the judicial system is highly inefficient and corrupt
 after -years of governmental neglect and popular contempt dating back to the
 Duvalier era. Political figures across the spectrum recognize that reform of the judi-
 
 
 425
 cial system is critical; it is understaffed and its members lack training and adequate
 compensation.
 The Constitution expressly denies police and jdicial authorities the right to inter-
 rogate persons chargd with a crime unless the suspect has legal counsel present
 or waives this right Nevertheless, interrogation without legal counsel present is the
 norm, and the use of beatings and torture to extract confessions was widespread
 prior to deployment of the MNF. Governments since the Duvalier era have ap-
 pointed and removed judges at will and have exerted political influence at every
 stage of the judicial process. Although the Aristide Government has asserted it will
 select judges in accordance with the Constitution, the Parliament has not yet adopt-
 ed legislation establishing the mechanisms necessary for selection of judicial person-
 nel.
 The Code of Criminal Procedure fails to assign clear responsibility to investigate
 crimes and divides authority to prosecute among police, prosecutors, and investigat-
 ing magistrates. The Code stipulates two criminal court sessions Jer year, each last-
 ing 2 weeks, to try all major crimes requiring a jury trial. Faiure to reform the
 Code has resulted in a huge backlog with detainees sometimes waiting for years
 in pretrial detention for a court date. For example, during the August session of the
 criminal assizes, the court heard only eight cases. At the beg ing of September,
 there were 534 civil prisoners at the national penitentiary, of whom only a fraction
 were serving sentences. The rest were accused persons held without bail. If ulti-
 mately tried and found innocent, the detainee has no recourse against the Govern-
 ment for time already served.
 Although the Government began to plan reforms of the judicial system, at years
 end the system remained highly inefficient and corrupt, and the Government had
 brought to justice few perpetrators of human rights abuses. The Government did
 initiate a system of 'triage' in which three judges would review the cases of persons
 for whom incarceration is no longer appropriate. In addition, working with U.. offi-
 cials, the Government began to select Ministry of Justice personnel to receive train-
 ing courses in basic administration of justice issues.
 Although the Constitution includes the right to counsel, there is no law that the
 Government must provide counsel in the event that the accused cannot afford it.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution provides that no house search or seizure of papers may take place ex-
 cept in accordance with the law. Correspondence is also defined as inviolable.
 Prior to September 19, soldiers and other armed persons frequently entered pri-
 vate homes for illegal purposes in Port-au-Prince and the rovinces. In August there
 was a rash of attacks on the homes of politicians, including parliamentarians and
 the mayor of Petionville, the capital's main suburb. Attaches and FRAPH members
 were involved in raids on homes, but victims also reported seeing soldiers personally
 known to them and dressed in civilian clothing among their attackers. In addition,
 gangsters violently raided entire neighborhoods of Port-au-Prince, taking advantage
 of their ties to police and the general climate of impunity to steal and rape. When
 the armed persons entered looking for a particular individual, they frequently beat
 or otherwise harmed family members during the search.
 The police, along with armed civilians acting at their behest, frequently used
 roadblocks to conduct illegal searches, especially during periods of real or perceived
 political tension. The discovery of pro-Aristide posters or literature during a police
 search of a house or vehicle frequently resulted in physical abuse and illegal arrest.
 There were credible reports that police and military also seized private correspond-
 ence during such searches.
 After the arrival of the MNF and the restoration of the legitimate Government,
 such abuses were dramatically reduced.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech
 and the press, and, in the last quarter of 1994, these rights were increasingly exer-
 cised. The more open climate contrasted with the first 9 months of the year when
 the military regime and de facto authorities significantly abridged freedom of ex-
 pression and the press through intimidation and the resultant self-censorship. The
 authorities routinely harassed radio and print journalists and vendors of pro-
 Aristide publications. The de facto regime increased restrictions on the press in late
 May and again with the illegal institution on August 1 of a state of siege, issuing
 a decree forbidding the press to publish "foreign propaganda= or information that
 might "alarm the populace." The decree threatened the broadcast media, warning
 that their facilities were subject to military requisition. In mid-August, the regime
 forbade the media to use statements and information from foreign embassies and
 their press services. The regime also restricted foreign journalists from traveling
 
 
 426
 outside of Port-au-Prince and entering certain "strategic zones." The de facto au-
 thorities deported a US. news team in August after filming at the airport and de-
 tained the team's two Haitian employees for 10 days.
 With an illitera  rate of approximately 80 percent broadcast media, especially
 Creole-language radio, are the principal means by wbich the populace receives infor-
 mation. For most of the year, there were 14 radio stations in Port-au-Prince, 6 of
 which offered news programming. Four radio stations operating before the Septem-
 ber 1991 coup closed permanently, but some stations sympathetic to President
 Aristide, including Tropic FM, continued to operate. Two independent daily news-
 papers operate in Port-au-Prince. Pro-Aristide weeklies published in Haiti and the
 United States were sold in the streets through most of the year, in September, the
 locally published ibete ceased operation, citing increased threats to distributors.
 However, the journal resumed publication soon after arrival of the MNF.
 In the months following the restoration of President Aristide's Government, sev-
 eral new journals appeared, among them a US.-based magazine, strongly anti-
 Aristide in its outlook. The press covered the activities of the newly restored Gov-
 ernment and the MNF extensively and without censorship. Radio Antilles, a radio
 station that had gone off the air in 1991, returned on New Year's Day 1995. The
 national television station was off the air for a time following the intervention, but
 just as it resumed broadcasting in December, the Minister of Information dismissed
 its director, a Malval appointee, sparking a mass resignation of employees.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The de facto authorities se-
 verely restricted the constitutional rights of freedom of assembly and association fol-
 lowing the 1991 coup. Until the arrival of the MNF, the fear of a military or para-
 military attack was sufficient to prevent most meetings, including those of nonpoliti-
 cal organizations, from taking place. There were credible reports from all parts of
 the country that the military engaged in a systematic effort to inhibit association.
 In July police and armed civilians attacked a regular meeting of the K-16 political
 coalition, led by legitimate Port-au-Prince mayor Evans Paul and Senator Turnep
 Delpe. The participants scattered; the police detained one person for a day but killed
 no one. The police arrested some community organizers, even of nonpolitical organi-
 zations, and sometimes beat, harassed, or intimidated them into fleeing their own
 communities. Grassroots liberation theology organizations known as "Ti Legliz" re-
 mained a strong base of support for President Aristide in the countryside. These
 groups and their leaders were particular targets of military and paramilitary har-
 assment. The police prevented civic education, community health, and literacy orga-
 nizations from operating normally.
 In a report to the U.N. Security Council covering the end of 1994, the U.N. Sec-
 retary General said, "Haitians can now enjoy their fundamental rights, in particular
 freedom of expression, association and assembly. In a number of places, however
 people have said that they are afraid to meet or demonstrate, because of continued
 activities by former FRAPH members or attaches. Politically motivated arrests by
 local judicial officials associated with FRAPH have occurred, but arrests for the ex-
 pression of political views have largely ceased. Large numbers of displaced people
 have come out of hiding and returned to their homes. Overall, there is a feeling of
 liberty and a sense of security which did not exist previously. This is particularly
 striking in the areas where the MNF has been deployed. The flurry of acts of venge-
 ance and retribution which erupted immediately prior to, and after, the return of
 President Jean-Bertrand Aristide on October 15, 1994, was short-lived. The Presi-
 dent has repeatedly called for reconciliation and his appeals have been heeded by
 the population."
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution protects the right to practice all reli-
 gions and faiths, provided that practice does not disturb law and order. Religion is
 an integral part of Haitian life and culture and is practiced widely. There are no
 government restrictions on missionary activities, affiliation with overseas coreligion-
 ists, religious instruction, or publishing.
 There were few hi-profile attacks on churches or church-related organizations
 in 1994. There were, however, a number of attacks on, and threats against, individ-
 ual priests openly supportive of Aristide or opposed to the de facto authorities.
 The August murder of Father Vincent (see Section L.a.) was probably tied to his
 actual and symbolic role in organizing citizens rather than his religious affiliation.
 At the same time, unidentified persons threatened Pere Samedi, a -Ti Legliz priest
 active in the slums of Jeremie, and many churches throughout the country bore
 anti-Aristide graffiti, as well as slogans directed against socially activist priests. In
 Aquin, gunmen fired upon the local Catholic church. A local army officer in
 Chardonnieres arrested and beat a priest who was distributing religious youth jour-
 nals in early August, and armed civilians attempted in July to attack a Belgian
 priest active in the human rights community in Port-au-Prince.
 
 
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emtration, and Re-
 patriation.-There are no legal restrictions on the movement of citizens within the
 country. The departure of boat people is technically illegal, but the authorities rare-
 ly enforced the pertinent laws. Occasionally they took some token legal action
 against organizers, and in a few instances they fired on departing boat people to
 deter them by intimidation. Members of the military and police also attempted to
 intimidate persons applying at US. refugee processin  centers in Haiti by harassing
 and occasionally beating them. Individuals m nthe military and under the de facto
 government occasionally harassed repatriated boat people in isolated incidents, but
 the authorities did not pursue a policy of general repression against them.
 The number of internally displaced persons increased due to economic, political,
 and security concerns. Historically, internal migration in Haiti has largely been
 from the countryside to the city, but after the September 1991 coup many Haitians
 reversed this flow, reting to their former abodes. This migration continued at the
 same time that many ru     families also were moving into the capital and other
 cities in pursuit of economic opportunities. One estimate by local human rights orga-
 nizations places the number of internally displaced Haitians in 1994 at 300,000.
 Departures by sea to escape the country's economic and political problems contin-
 ued. During the first half of the year, the United States continued its policy of re-
 turning Haitians interdicted on the high seas directly to Haiti under the terms of
 the Alien Migrant Interdiction Operation agreement. Boththe de facto government
 and the restored democratic Government cooperated in implementing the terms of
 this agreement. The United States began offering the bat people the option of ship-
 board refugee hearings in May and discontinued involuntary repatriation completely
 in July, taig them to safe haven at US. naval facilities at Guantanamo, Cuba,
 instead. After the return of President Aristide, the United States repatriated Hai-
 tians from the safe haven. The Aristide Government also cooperated i the reatri-
 ations of Haitian citizens from other countries, including The Bahamas and Cuba.
 After commercial flights to and from Haiti ceased in July, the de facto government
 occasionally obstructed, but ultimately did not prohibit, the departure of citizens
 across the land border.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Rght of Citizens to Change Their Gouern-
 ment
 The September 1991 military coup forcly abridged the right of citizens to change
 their government. Coup leaders forced President Aristide to flee the country, and
 most senior members of his administration either went into hiding, fled the country,
 or took refuge in foreign embassies. The continuing adamant refusal of the military
 regtime and its backers to allow the peoples will to be expressed was the root of
 most politically motivated human rights violations. Voters elected members of Par-
 liament and such local officials as mayors along with President Aristide at the end
 of 1990. The coup leaders persecuted some local elected officials and ousted them
 from office after the coup.
 Despite international diplomatic efforts and sanctions, a military triumvirate con-
 tinuedt control the security forces and thus the country. Commander in Chief Gen-
 eral Raoul Cedras, Chief of Staff General Philippe Biamby, and Metropolitan Police
 Chief Michel Francois adamantly opposed the return of the constitutionally elected
 President. Members of Parliament remained in place and played a continuing role
 in po.litical events. In early 1994, many members of Parliament, as well as other
 politicians, worked together on a "parliamentary plan" to resolve the political crisis.
 _After its failure, a group of renegade Senators, including eight who had been
 elected in illegal elections on January 18, 1993, seized control of the Senate, effec-
 tively prhibiting the legitimate Senate president from exercising the functions of
 his office. The Chamber of Deputies was unable to achieve a quorum during the
 summer of 1994, preventing the passage of any legislation. In May te illegal- par-
 allel Senate rubberstamped the appointment of de facto President Emile Jonassaint
 and the nominations of his cainet members, but all legal semblance of a Par-
 liament had disintegrated by September 12, the closing date for the year's Chamber
 of Deputies session.
 President Aristide had appointed Robert Malval Prime Minister in 1993. He re-
 signed in December of that year but continued as acting Prime Minister until Octo-
 ber. The military leadership and the de facto authorities prevented him and his
 ministers from carrying out most of their functions throughout the first three quar-
 ters of 1994. Following the arrival of the MNF, President Aristide convoked the Na-
 tional Assembly in special session under terms of the Constitution to consider am-
 nesty legislation for coup-related crimes, a bill creating a national civil police force
 separate from the military, and other legislation. The Parliament passed both an
 amnesty bill and legislation creating a new police force. With the end of parliamen-
 
 
 428
 
 tary and municipal mandates near, legislators, politicians, and the President
 reached a consensus in December on aProvisional Electoral Council (CEP). By
 year's end, the CEP was drafting legislation necessary to carry out the elections,
 which are expected to take place in April or May 1995.
 There are no legal impediments to women's participation in politics or govern-
 ment, but in practice the generally lower societal status of women limits their role
 in these fields. While there are only 3 women among the 79 members in the Cham-
 ber of Deputies, there are also 3 women heading ministries in the Aristide Cabinet,
 and 1 female Deputy Minister.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 About a dozen local human rihts groups exist in Haiti, and most grassroots orga-
 nizations, whether geographicay or politically based, track violations against their
 members. By September only a handful of attorneys offered pro bono legal assist-
 ance to these groups, and all exercised caution as result of threats to their safety.
 Prior to September 19, human rights organization officials reported repeated
 threats. In July, for example, gun-wielding civilians attacked a Belgian priest active
 in the Haitian religious community and the human rights field, but the attackers
 fled when local residents challenged them. Local human rights groups managed to
 operate freely enough to gather data on reported violations, and to offer humani-
 tarian assistance (e.g., shelter, food, medical care) to those whom the authorities
 abused or persecuted.
 The ICM a team of international human rights observers under joint United Na-
 tions and Organization of American States auspices, returned to Haiti in January,
 after a 3-month withdrawal. The monitors, who numbered about 90, remained until
 July 13, when the de facto government declared the ICM to be in illegal status and
 ordered its expulsion. Until then, the military and the de facto civilian authorities
 largely tolerated the ICM's activities, although local officials intermittently blocked
 ICM monitors from access to prisons. The monitors reported ongoing threats, how-
 ever, from paramilitary operatives and attaches. In March armed civilians harassed
 a team of investigators in the central plateau town of Hinche while local military
 officers stood by without acting. In late April, a team in Borgne was the object of
 an orchestrated military demonstration, apparently with the active complicity of
 general staff officers from Port-au-Prince. The international community generally
 recognized the ICM as both a reliable investigatory body and a buffer, during its
 presence, against more egregious violations, at least on the part of the regime itself.
 The ICM resumed operation in October following the arrival of the MNF.
 Representatives of international human rights organizations visited Haiti from
 time to time. These groups also faced threats and harassment, but their high profile
 permitted them to operate relatively freely. In May the Inter-American Commission
 on Human Rights (IACHR) visited to gather information on the human rights situa-
 tion. The IACHR attempted to return in August, but the de facto authorities refused
 to grant clearance for a charter flight to land. The IACHR finally visited in October
 and noted the improvement in human rights observance after arrival of the MNF.
 The ICRC established a permanent representative in Port-au-Prince and was able
 to perform some prison monitoring, although the de facto government was slow in
 responding to requests to visit detainees. Following the MNF's deployment, the
 ICRC continued to monitor prison conditions at the National Penitentiary and at
 prisons outside Port-au-Prince.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The 1987 Constitution does not specifically prohibit discrimination on the grounds
 of race, sex, religion, disability, language, or social status. It does, however, provide
 for freedom of religion and guarantees equal working conditions regardless of sex,
 beliefs, or marital status. It specifically states that handicapped persons shall have
 the means to assure their autonomy, education, and independence.
 Women.-Although women are often the breadwinners for rural and urban poor
 families, they do not enjoy the same economic and social status as men. In some
 social strata, tradition limits women's roles; peasant women, for example, remain
 largely in the traditional occupations of farming, marketing, and domestic tasks.
 Poorer families sometimes ration education money to pay school fees for male chil-
 dren only. Nonetheless, women have occupied prominent positions in both the public
 and private sectors in recent years.
 Knowledgeable local authorities report that bth criminal and domestic violence
 and rape occur but are rarel reported or prosecuted. After the MNF's deployment
 victims increasingly reported criminal incidents, including rape. In November and
 
 
 429
 December, victims reported one to two rapes per week in Port-au-Prince. Existing
 laws and penalties against these crimes would be adequate were they enforced.
 Children.-Rural families continued to send young children to serve as unpaid do-
 mestic labor for more affluent city dwellers. The use of children in this manner is
 not limited to the wealthy class; middle and lower class families also follow the
 practice, called "restavek.* A 1991 U.N. study cited the estimated 109,000 restavek
 children as an example of slavery practiced in the 20th century. Employers compel
 the children to work long hours, provide them with poor nourishment, little or no
 education, and frequently beat them or abuse them sexually.
 Port-au-Prince's large population of street children includes runaway restaveks, as
 well as children orphaned or separated from their families. The abysmal state of the
 economy only worsened the plight of such children, who are held in little regard.
 Rumors of street children being targeted by paramilitary operatives were probably
 based on the general disregard for the well-bing of such children. Local human
 rights groups do not regard the plight of restavek children as a priority and do not
 report on abuses of children or actively seek to improve their situation. The Govern-
 ment took no measures to protect or otherwise provide for the restaveks or the
 street children.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-Some 99 percent of Haitians are descend-
 ants, in whole or in part, of African slaves who won their war of independence from
 France in 1804. The remaining population is of European, Middle Eastern, North
 American, or Latin American origin. There are longstanding social and political ani-
 mosities among Haitians, often tied to ethnic/racial heritage or class; some of these
 animosities date back before Haiti's revolutionary period.
 There are two official languages: Creole, which is spoken by virtually all Haitians,
 and French, which is spoken by about 20 percent of the population. The inability
 to read, write, and speak French has long limited the political and economic oppor-
 tunities available to the majority of the population. Many argue that the French-
 speaking elite have used language requirements as an additional barrier to the ad-
 vancement of the Creole-speaking majority.
 People With Disabilities.-Despite the constitutional provision for means of auton-
 omy for the handicapped, there is no enacting legislation mandating provision of ac-
 cess for people with disabilities. There is no overt ill-treatment of people with dis-
 abilities, but, given the desperate poverty in which the vast majority of Haitians
 live, those with disabilities face a particularly harsh existence.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution and the Labor Code provide for the
 right of association and provide workers, including those in the public sector, the
 right to form and join unions without prior government authorization. The law re-
 quires a union, which must have a minimum of 10 members, to register with the
 Ministry of Social Affairs within 60 days of its establishment. Union membership,
 marginal before the 1991 coup and even more so now, is estimated at I percent of
 the total labor force. There are five principal labor federations: the Autonomous
 Central of Haitian Workers, the National Confederation of Haitian Teachers, the
 Federation of Unionized Workers, the Confederation of Haitian Workers, and the
 Independent General Organization of Haitian Workers. Each of these organizations
 maintains some fraternal relations with various international labor organizations.
 Given the effect of the international sanctions on the formal sector of the econ-
 omy, and, with unemplonment running as high as 80 percent, unions were almost
 irrelevant, except as an instrument for keeping track of and offering limited assist-
 ance to their members. During the period of de facto rule, the military continued
 to employ widespread repression and violence against those who engaged in trade
 union activities. Many union leaders closed their offices and went into hiding in the
 aftermath of the 1991 coup. Armed civilians attacked a meeting of officials of one
 of the large unions in August 1994 and beat several of those present. Unions, as
 well as all other citizen groups or assemblies, could meet only with the express writ-
 ten permission of the military. Since the return of President Aristide, labor unions,
 like other institutions of civil society, have been free to associate. In meetings with
 the Government and representatives of the international community, unions have
 sought to encourage investment and an increased job market for their members.
 A tripartite commission of labor, management, and government been to revise
 the Labor Code in 1986 and concluded its negotiations in 1992. However, Par-
 liament has yet to approve the new Code. The revised Code recognizes the right to
 strike but restricts the duration of certain types of strikes, as did the previous code.
 It also stipulates that the Ministry of Social Affairs must recognize workers' right
 to strike in each case before a strike is legal.
 
 
 430
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The Labor Code protects
 trade union organizing activities and stipulates fines for those who interfere with
 this right. While the de facto authorities curtailed union activities, job losses as a
 result of economic conditions had a far more damaging impact on union activities.
 Prior to the 1991 coup, organized labor activity was generally concentrated in the
 Port-au-Prince area, primarily in a large pivate sugar refinery, in the assembly sec-
 tor, and in state enterprises, all three of which suffered drastic job losses following
 the oup.
 Collective bargaining, which has never been widespread, was nonexistent in 1994.
 Employers generally set wages unilaterally. While Haiti has no export processing
 zones, prior to the trade embargo it did have a sizable export-oriented assembly sec-
 tor. The Labor Code does not distinguish between industries producing for the local
 market and those producing for export. Many assembly sector companies were the
 focus of developmental efforts; they received greater outside scrutiny and were con-
 sequently somewhat more generous with benefits and wages. Employment in the ex-
 port assembly sector, however, declined drastically from 1991 through 1994, result-
 ing in a loss of an estimated 34,500 jobs. As the assembly sector contracted, unions
 that were particularly strong in this sector declined accordingly.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Labor Code prohibits forced
 or compulsory labor, but the Government rarely enforces these provisions. Children
 continued to be subjected to forced domestic labor (see Section 5).
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The minimum employment age for
 minors in all sectors is 15 years. Fierce adult competition for jobs ensures that child
 labor is not a factor in the industrial sector. Children under 15 commonly work at
 odd jobs in both rural and urban settings to supplement family income. The Min-
 istry of Social Affairs is responsible for enforcement of child labor laws, but the
 International Labor Organization has criticized the enforcement as inadequate.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The law establishes a minimum wage, and a
 few weeks before the September 1991 coup, Parliament set a new minimum wage
 of about $1.85 (26 gourdes) per day for workers in the industrial sector. Although
 the minimum wage technically became law before the coup, the Government never
 published the legislation in the official Gazette; nevertheless, companies in the as-
 sembly sector adopted it. Even if the private sector applied the revised minimum
 wage widely, it would not provide a worker and family with a decent living. The
 minimum wage law also applies to agricultural workers, but the authorities do not
 enforce it. Thus the majority of wage earners, who work in the agricultural sector,
 must survive on considerably less than the minimum wage.
 The Labor Code govems individual employment; it sets the normal workday at
 8 hours and the workweek at 48 hours, with 24 hours of rest on Sunday. It also
 establishes minimum health and safety regulations. Employers in the industrial sec-
 tor, which is concentrated in the Port-au-Prince area and more accessible to outside
 scrutiny, generally observe these laws in practice. However the Ministry of Social
 Affairs does not enforce them. It also does not enforce Labor Code provisions on
 health and safety. With more than 50 percent of the population unemployed, work-
 ers are not able to exercise the right to remove themselves from dangerous work
 situations without jeopardy to continued employment.
