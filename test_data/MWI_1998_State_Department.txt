 MALAWI
 The Republic of Malawi held its first democratic, multiparty elections since inde-
 pendence in 1994, following 30 years of authoritarian, one-party rule. Constitutional
 power is shared between the popularly-elected president and the 177-member Na-
 tional Assembly. President Bakili Muluzi leads the United Democratic Front (UDF)
 party, which holds an 83-seat plurality in the National Assembly, but has built a
 voting majority through alliance with independent and "rebel" opposition members
 of the Assembly. The opposition Malawi Congress Party (MCP), formerly the sole
 legal party, holds 45 seats, while the opposition Alliance for Democracy (AFORD)
 holds 28 seats. Seven AFORD "rebel" Members of Parliament (MP's) and eight
 former MCP MP's sit as independents. Seven seats are vacant. The legislature dem-
 onstrated only limited independence from the executive. The 1997 High Court ruling
 that cabinet ministers could not sit as MP's at the same time has not been imple-
 mented. The Government respects the constitutional provisions for an independent
 judiciary; however, the judicial system is inefficient and lacks resources.
 The National Police, headed by the Inspector General of Police under the Ministry
 of Home Affairs, are responsible for internal security. The police occasionally called
 on the army for support. While violence and common crime have become frequent,
 there was no indication of violence organized by remnants of the Malawi Young Pio-
 neers (MYP), formerly the MCP's paramilitary wing. Despite notable improvements,
 there continued to be credible allegations of human rights abuses by the police.
 The country is a very poor, with a narrow economic base characterized by a small
 and highly concentrated industrial sector, low levels of foreign and domestic invest-
 ment, and few mineral resources. Agriculture dominates the economy, contributing
 about 87 percent of export earnings, 36 percent of gross domestic product, and em-
 ploying over 80 percent of the labor force. Three crops--tobacco, tea, and sugar-
 generate about 78 percent of export earnings, with tobacco providing the largest
 share. There is little industry and mining, and no known economically viable depos-
 its of gemstones, precious metals, or oil. The country is a landlocked nation, and
 transport costs constitute over 40 percent of its imports-a serious impediment to
 economic development and trade. While the country has followed a series of struc-
 tural adjustment programs since the early 1980's, major progress towards economic
 liberalization, particularly in agriculture, did not occur until the 1990's. The Govern-
 ment continues to divest its ownership of public enterprises. Wealth remains con-
 centrated in the hands of a small elite. In 1997 per capita income was approxi-
 mately $220 and average annual inflation dropped from 15 percent to 9.2 percent.
 However, a 55 percent currency devaluation in August resulted in a substantial eco-
 nomic shock.
 The Government generally respected the human rights of its citizens in many
 areas, but serious problems remained. There were instances of deaths of detainees
 while in, or shortly after release from police custody. While the number of incidents
 declined, the police continued to abuse detainees and to use excessive force in han-
 dling criminal suspects. Prison conditions remained harsh and life threatening.
 Lengthy pretrial detention, an inefficient and understaffed judicial system, and lim-
 ited resources called into question the ability of defendants to receive a timely, and
 in some cases, fair trial. High levels of common crime prompted angry mobs to exe-
 cute summarily alleged criminals.
 The state-controlled Malawi Broadcasting Corporation continued to broadcast on
 two radio channels and controlled broadcast news coverage and editorial content. In
 addition to a private station that broadcasts religious programming, a second pri-
 
 
 249
 vate station began broadcasting in August. By contrast the print media continued
 to report freely. Parliament passed legislation in June on membership and proce-
 dures for the Human Rights Commission' which is mandated by the constitution to
 explore human rights violations. In December five public members were appointed
 to the commission. Women continued to experience severe societal discrimination,
 and violence against women and children remained a problem. The Government
 took steps in its economic development programs to assist disadvantaged women.
 On two separate occasions, the Government prevented the Malawi Congress of
 Trade Unions from holding large public meetings.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political
 killings. There were incidents of deaths of detainees while in, or shortly after re-
 lease from, police custody. These deaths involved possible use of excessive force or
 possible negligence. For example, in September in the town of Namitete, a bus driv-
 er in police custody allegedly was beaten to death. He was buried without his family
 being allowed access to the body.
 A large number of prisoners died largely due to harsh prison conditions (see Sec-
 tion 1.c.).
 Frustrated by inadequate law enforcement and rising crime, angry mobs some-
 times resorted to vigilante justice in beating, stoning, or burning suspected crimi-
 nals to death. The police identified over 40 such cases in the first quarter of the
 year and made some attempts-largely unsuccessful-to identify and arrest those
 responsible.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution prohibits torture and other cruel, inhuman, or degrading treat-
 ment. Although that provision is generally respected, the Inspectorate of Prisons, an
 investigative body mandated by the Constitution, confirmed that the police contin-
 ued to abuse detainees physically. There have been some marginal improvements
 resulting from training in investigative interviewing skills and from workshops
 aimed at changing officers' attitudes. However, limited resources for training and
 facilities have resulted in very slow process. While higher ranking officials dem-
 onstrated familiarity with new standards for the humane treatment of prisoners,
 their subordinates commonly employed unacceptable techniques. According to the
 October .1997 Inspectorate of Prisons report, unacceptable techniques used by police
 included beatings, physical assault, and the use of wire instead of handcuffs to re-
 strain prisoners and to force confessions. These abuses are sometimes hidden by
 keeping a prisoner in police custody until wounds heal before turning the prisoner
 over to the prison system for remand. The mistreatment is partly due to the mis-
 taken belief of many police officers that the law requires them to present a case (not
 just charges) to the court within 48 hours of arrest. The Government continued to
 seek community involvement in its comprehensive reform of the police.
 Prison conditions remained harsh and life threatening. Overcrowding, inadequate
 nutrition, and substandard sanitation and poor health facilities remained serious
 problems. According to the Inspectorate of Prisons report, harsh conditions and in-
 adequate health care contributed to the deaths from disease of over 200 inmates
 over a 20-month period from January 1996 to August 1997. While not kept in sepa-
 rate facilities, women are segregated within the prison compound and tended by fe-
 male guards. Only four prisons have separate facilities for juveniles. In the other
 prisons, juveniles are incarcerated with adults.
 The Inspectorate of Prisons and local organizations monitor police behavior and
 prison conditions without government interference.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The law permits the accused to challenge
 the legality of detention, to have access to legal counsel, and to be released or in-
 formed of charges by a court of law within 48 hours. n an effort to comply with
 the 48-hour rule, police occasionally resorted to beatings in order to obtain informa-
 tion necessary to their case. In cases where the court determines that a defendant
 cannot afford to supply his own counsel, legal services are provided by the Govern-
 ment. With few persons able to afford legal counsel, the country's four public defend-
 ers were not sufficient to meet the needs of indigent detainees. Bail is frequently
 granted to reduce prison overcrowding. Its use often bears only a tenuous relation
 to the merits of an individual's situation. At year's end, approximately 30 percent
 of the 6,800 prison inmates were detainees awaiting tria.
 The Government does not use forced exile.

 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution provides for an independent judi-
 ciary, and the Government respects this provision in practice. However, the judicial
 system is handicapped by serious weaknesses, including poor record keeping, short-
 age of attorneys and trained personnel, a heavy caseload, and a lack of resources.
 The Constitution provides for a High Court, a Supreme Court of Appeal, and sub-
 ordinate magistrate courts. The Chief Justice is appointed by the President and con-
 firmed by the National Assembly. Other justices are appointed by the President fol-
 lowing a recommendation by the Judicial Service Commission. All justices are ap-
 pointed until the age of 65 and may be removed only for reasons of incompetence
 or misbehavior, as determined by the President and a majority of the Parliament.
 By law defendants have the right to a public trial but not to a trial by jury. In
 murder cases, the High Court nevertheless used juries of 12 persons from the de-
 fendant's home district. Defendants are also entitled to an attorney, the right to
 present and challenge evidence and witnesses, and the right of appeal. However, the
 judiciary's budgetary and administrative problems effectively denied expeditious
 trials for many defendants.
 Traditional court judges, absorbed into the magistrate court system, receive some
 training in court procedure and the body of law that they administer. The High
 Court also began a training program for lay magistrates.
 Juvenile offenders have special rights under the Constitution, including the right
 to be separated in custody from adults, to be treated in a manner that recognizes
 their age and the possibility for rehabilitation, and to be exempt from the punish-
 ment of life imprisonment without the possibility of release. However, while they
 are treated and tried as juveniles, many juvenile offenders are incarcerated with
 adults.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-Govern-
 ment authorities generally respected the constitutional right to privacy regarding
 person, family, home, and private communications. However, army and police forces,
 in carrying out sweeps for illegal weapons, did not obtain search warrants as re-
 quired by law. Postal authorities have apparently ceased their former practice of
 opening and inspecting private correspondence.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedoms of
 speech and of the press, and the Government generally respected these rights in
 practice. The Government generally tolerated the broad spectrum of political and
 ideological opinion presented in the country's two dozen newspapers. However,
 media representatives complained about government secrecy and periodic verbal
 threats against members of the press by government officials. In January six army
 soldiers, allegedly upset over an article about HIV/AIDS in the military forces, en-
 tered an opposition newspaper office, assaulted journalists and damaged equipment.
 The army investigated the incident, and the army commander apologized publicly
 in July, stating that the raid had been the act of individuals and had not been au-
 thorized by the army. There is no record of any action being taken against the sol-
 diers.
 Malawi has four radio stations. One private station began broadcasting in
 Blantyre in August, and only broadcasts music and entertainment. A second station
 broadcasts only religious programming and is not permitted to broadcast news. In
 addition the Government has issued licenses for another private station, which has
 not begun broadcasting, a second religious station, and a community radio station
 based in Mangochi district. State-owned Malawi Broadcasting Corporation (MBC),
 which broadcasts on two channels, is the most important medium for reaching the
 public. MBC programming was dominated by reporting on the activities of senior
 government figures and official government positions. Parties and groups opposed
 to the Government largely were denied access to the broadcast media. MBC refused
 to broadcast paid public announcements of labor union events. In November Par-
 liament passed a communications bill that established an independent communica-
 tions regulatory authority responsible for issuing licenses for radio, television, and
 Internet service providers.
 There were no restrictions on academic freedom.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 freedom of assembly and association, and the Government respects these rights in
 practice. Authorities routinely granted official permits; which are required by law
 for large meetings. However, despite being properly notified by the Malawi Congress
 of Trade Unions (MCTU), police prevented the MCTU from holding large open meet-
 ings in January and February.
 
 
 The Government requires organizations, including political parties, to register
 with the Registrar General in the Ministry of Justice. There were no reports of
 groups being denied registration during the year.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the
 Government respects this right in practice. Religious groups must register with the
 Government. Missionaries experienced occasional difficulties in renewing employ-
 ment permits, despite the Governments revision of its policy and procedures on
 temporary employment permits (TEP's) in 1997 (see Section 2.d.).
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-Citizens have freedom of movement and residence within the country,
 and the right to leave and return. Despite the lifting of restrictions on where Asians
 could live, there have been few Asians or other expatriates who have relocated from
 cities and towns to rural areas.
 The Government cooperated with the Office of the United Nations High Commis-
 sioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in managing the refugee community. According to the
 UNHCR, Malawi hosted over 900 refugees, primarily from Somalia and the Great
 Lakes region, at the country's refugee center. Although the Government grants refu-
 gee status, it does not accept refugees for resettlement and does not permit them
 to work or study. Asylum applicants are granted hearings to make their case for
 asylum status. In February 1997, the Government decided that no further applica-
 tions for asylum from Rwandans would be considered. The Government also invoked
 the principle of first country of asylum against many of the Rwandans and Congo-
 lese who either had requested asylum in another country or had the opportunity to
 do so. Although there were no reports of bona fide refugees seeking first asylum
 being turned away, nongovernmental organization (NGO) sources continue to ex-
 press concern that some of those found not to be bona fide refugees-primarily Con-
 golese-were rejected because of poor quality translation or ambiguous questions
 that trapped or misled otherwise qualified refugees. There were no reports of forced
 return of persons to a country where they feared persecution.
 Although the Government introduced a new policy for temporary employment per-
 mits (TEP) for foreigners in 1997, the slow and inconsistent processing of TEP appli-
 cations caused concern and sometimes hardship to businessmen, teachers, health
 workers, and missionaries (see Section 5). In a case characterized by a lack of due
 process, an expatriate director of a relief and development NGO was ordered to
 leave the country after apparently offending a politically well-connected member of
 the Board of the Malawi Congress of Nongovernment Organizations (CONGOMA).
 Business residence permits are readily granted to new investors.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens are generally able to exercise this constitutional right. Malawi has uni-
 versal suffrage for citizens 18 years of age and older. There were allegations of vote
 buying and intimidation in 1997 and 1998 by-elections.
 President Muluzi, Vice President Justin Malewezi, and a 34-member cabinet exer-
 cise executive authority. The Second Vice Presidency remains vacant following the
 resignation of Chakufwa Chihana and the collapse of the UDF-AFORD coalition.
 While the executive and the legislature were elected in free, democratic elections,
 the executive in fact exerted considerable influence over the legislature. In 1997 the
 Minister of Local Government announced that, to hold down costs, local government
 elections would be postponed. In December Parliament passed legislation which pro-
 vides for elected councils in each of the 26 districts. The Electoral Commission an-
 nounced that local government elections would be held 3 months after presidential
 and parliamentary elections scheduled for May 1999. Although the Government does
 not prevent the operation of opposition political parties, the parties have alleged
 that the Government utilizes bribery and other inducements to encourage opposition
 party divisions and defections of key personnel to the UDF.
 There are no laws that restrict the participation of women or minorities in the
 political process. However, there are very few women in prominent government posi-
 tions. Only two women are ministers, and there are nine women in the National
 Assembly.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 A wide variety of local and international human rights groups operated without
 government restriction, training civic educators, advocating changes to existing laws
 and cultural practices, and investigating and publishing their findings on human
 rights cases. Government officials are generally cooperative and responsive to their
 views.
 
 
 The Ombudsman is mandated by the Constitution to investigate and take legal
 action against government officials responsible for human rights violations and
 other abuses. The work of the Ombudsman's office was hampered when the Om-
 budsman was dismissed in August by the Public Appointments Committee for al-
 leged financial malfeasance following a thorough investigation by the Auditor Gen-
 eral. A new Ombudsman was scheduled to be appointed in January 1999. The Om-
 budsman's freedom of action was circumscribed by legislation that requires a war-
 rant and a 3-day waiting period to gain access to certain government records.
 The Constitution also provides for a National Compensation Tribunal (NCT) to
 adjudicate claims of criminal and civil liability against the former government. As
 of August 1997, the NCT estimated that it would need $35 million to cover the esti-
 mated 7,000 filed claims; to date, only 15 percent of these claims have been re-
 solved. Very few claims were settled during the year due to a lack of funds. Other
 large sums were disbursed to settle non-NCT lawsuits against the Government for
 similar human rights violations. However, the prominence of many of the recipients
 raised concerns of favoritism. In June Parliament passed legislation on membership
 and procedures for the constitutionally mandated Human Rights Commission, which
 is entrusted with monitoring and protecting against violations of constitutional
 rights. In December five public members were appointed to the Commission but it
 had not begun to operate by year's end.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution specifically provides for equal rights for women; forbids discrimi-
 nation based on language, culture, or religion; and generally provides every citizen
 the right to equality and recognition before the law. In practice the capacity of gov-
 ernment institutions to assure equal rights for all citizens is limited.
 Women.-Spousal abuse, especially wife beating, is common. Malawian society has
 begun to take problems of violence against women seriously. The press published
 more frequent accounts of rape and abuse, and the judiciary imposed heavier pen-
 alties on those convicted of rape. However, domestic violence is not discussed openly
 by women, reportedly even among themselves, and there are no confidential shelters
 or facilities for treatment of women who suffer physical or sexual abuse. Police do
 not normally intervene in domestic disputes.
 Under the Constitution, women have the right to full and equal protection by law
 and may not be discriminated against on the basis of sex or marital status. In prac-
 tice, however, discrimination against women is pervasive, and women do not have
 opportunities equal to those available to men. Women have significantly lower levels
 of literacy, education, political representation, formal and nontraditional employ-
 ment opportunities, and access to resources to increase agricultural productivity.
 Women, especially in rural areas, historically have been unable to complete even
 a primary education, and are therefore at a serious disadvantage finding employ-
 ment. In education accepted economic and social practice hampers the ability of
 women and girls to succeed. The literacy rate among women aged 15 to 45 is less
 than 35 percent. Male literacy in the same age group is about 45 percent. Girls drop
 out of school more frequently than boys do, and in the final year of primary school,
 only about 25 percent of students are girls. Despite recent significant gains in girls'
 education, large gaps remain between girls' and boys' achievement. Still, there have
 been signs of improvement in education for girls. Girls entered first grade in the
 same proportion as boys this year, and 39 percent of secondary school entrants are
 girls.
 Women often have less access to legal and financial assistance, and wives are
 often victims of discriminatory inheritance practices in which the majority of the es-
 tate is taken unlawfully by the deceased husband's family. Women are usually at
 a disadvantage in marriage, family, and property rights but have begun to speak
 out against abuse and discrimination. Female-headed households are disproportion-
 ately represented in the lowest quarter of income distribution. In a country where
 85 percent of the population is rural, 70 percent of the rural female population farm
 full-time. Typically, women work more hours than men to complete the same farm
 tasks because they rarely have comparable tools and equipment and remain respon-
 sible for all household tasks. Women have limited access to agricultural extension
 services, training, and credit. Some progress has been made in all of these areas
 with gender training for agricultural extension workers and the gradual introduc-
 tion of rural credit programs for women. The participation of women in the limited
 formal labor market is particularly constrained. Women make up less than 5 per-
 cent of the managerial and administrative staff.
 
 
 Women face significant health problems. Malawi has a high maternal mortality
 rate. HIV/AIDS is a major threat, and females in the 15 to 24 age bracket are six
 times more likely to be HIV positive than men.
 The Law Commissioner has undertaken a review of legislation that discriminates
 against women and has proposed legislation to bring the law into compliance with
 new constitutional standards. In 1997 Parliament passed an affiliation bill that
 raised the minimum level of child support. In June Parliament passed a wills and
 inheritance bill that increased widows' rights.
 The Government addresses women's concerns through the Ministry of Women,
 Youth, and Community Services. The National Commission on Women in Develop-
 ment coordinates government and NGO activities. The inaugural meeting of the
 Gender Initiative Network (GIN) was held in 1997. The GIN attempts to bring to-
 gether the largely urban women's rights activists and the overwhelming rural ma-
 jority to discuss common interests.
 Children.-The Constitution provides for equal treatment of children under the
 law, and the Government greatly increased spending on children's health and wel-
 fare. The Government established free primary education for all children in 1994,
 although education is not compulsory. Well over half of the country's children live
 in poverty, mostly in rural areas. Children in rural, female-headed households are
 among the poorest. A few charitable organizations attempted to reduce the number
 of *id beggars in urban areas and find alternative care for them. The problem of
 street children worsened as the number of orphans whose parents died from HIV/
 AIDS increased. In 1995 there were an estimated 140,000 children who had lost
 their mother to AIDS, and this is expected to increase to 300,000 by 2000.
 Only one-third of children have easy access to safe drinking water. Infant mortal-
 ity is high. Child malnutrition is a serious problem.
 There are societal patterns of abuse of children. A few small ethnic groups prac-
 tice female genital mutilation, which is widely condemned by international health
 experts as damaging to both physical and psychological health. The media have also
 begun to report on the sexual abuse of children, especially in relation to traditional
 practices of initiation. While rites to initiate girls into their future adult roles are
 still secret, new information suggests that abusive practices are widespread and
 more damaging than previously believed. Also, the belief that children are unlikely
 to be HIV positive contributes to the sexual abuse of minors. National data on AIDS
 cases show that adolescent girls are three to four times more likely than adolescent
 boys to be HIV positive or to suffer from AIDS.
 In November 1997, Parliament passed an affiliation bill, which raised the mini-
 mum level of child sup ort.
 People With Disabilities.-The Government has not mandated accessibility to
 buildings and services for the disabled, but one of the national goals in the Constitu-
 tion is to support the disabled through greater access to public places, fair opportu-
 nities in employment, and full participatioin n all spheres of society. There are both
 public and privately supported schools and training centers, which assist individuals
 with disabilities. There are also several self-supporting businesses run by and for
 persons with disabilities. In December President Muluzi established a new cabinet
 position, the Minister Responsible for the Welfare of People with Disabilities.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-Malawians of African heritage are members
 of indigenous tribes and are not discriminated against by government or society.
 Former restrictions on where Asians could live and work are now unconstitutional
 (see Section 2.d.).
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The 1996 Labor Relations Act (LRA) entered into
 force in 1997. Workers have the legal right to form and join trade unions, but
 unions must register with the Registrar of Trade Unions and Employers' Organiza-
 tions in the Ministry of Labor and Vocational Training (MOLVT). Army personnel
 and police may not belong to trade unions, but other civil servants are allowed to
 form unions. There are no unusually difficult registration procedures. Given the low
 percentage of the work force in the formal sector (about 12 percent), plus the lack
 of awareness of worker rights and union benefits, only a minuscule percentage of
 the work force are union members. Statistics on the numbers of union members are
 not available. Unions are independent of the government, parties and other political
 forces.
 The LRA allows members of a registered union to strike only after all dispute set-
 tlement procedures established in a collective agreement and conciliation procedures
 have faled. The law requires a notice in writing to the employer and the MOLVT
 at least 7 days before a strike. The law also forbids temporary replacement of labor,
 and allows peaceful picketing during strikes. However, members of a registered
 
 
 254
 union in "essential services" do not have the right to strike. Essential services are
 specified as services whose interruption would endanger the life, health, or personal
 safety of the whole or part of the population; they are determined by the industrial
 relations court upon application by the Minister of Labor. The law provides similar
 procedures for lockouts.
 Laws do not specifically prohibit retaliation against strikers. There is no prohibi-
 tion on actions against unions that are not legally registered. Arbitration rulings are
 legally enforceable.
 Unions may form or join federations, and have the right to affiliate with and par-
 ticipate in international workers' organizations with the permission of the govern-
 ment. Although there are no restrictions on the number of union federations, Ma-
 lawi has only one, the MCTU. All unions are affiliated with it.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Unions have the right to or-
 ganize and bargain collectively. The LRA requires at least 20 percent of employees
 (excluding senior managerial staff) to belong to a union before such union can en-
 gage in collective bargaining at the enterprise level. The LRA requires at least 15
 percent union membership for collective bargaining at the sector level. The law pro-
 vides for the establishment of industrial councils in the absence of collective agree-
 ments for sector-level bargaining. Industrial council functions include wage negotia-
 tion, dispute resolution, and industry-specific labor policy development. Collective
 agreements are legally binding, and must be deposited by both parties with the Reg-
 istrar of Trade Unions.
 The law prohibits antiunion discrimination by employers, and requires that em-
 ployers reinstate workers dismissed because of union activities.
 Parliament approved legislation to establish export-processing zones (EPZ's) in
 1995. As of September, 15 companies held licenses to operate under EPZ status, and
 10 were operational. The full range of labor regulations applies to the EPZ's.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Constitution prohibits forced
 labor, and such labor is not employed. The law does not specifically prohibit forced
 and bonded labor by children, but such practices are not known to occur. Significant
 child labor in agricultural work and domestic service occurs largely as a function
 of extreme poverty and longstanding cultural tradition.
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment.-The Con-
 stitution defines children as people less than 16 years of age. It prohibits the em-
 ployment of children in work that is hazardous, harmful, or interferes with their
 education. The law does not specifically prohibit forced and bonded labor by chil-
 dren, but such practices are not known to occur. Primary education is free and uni-
 versal, but not compulsory. Budgetary constraints largely preclude minimum work
 age and child labor law enforcement by police and Ministry of Labor and Vocational
 Training inspectors. There is significant child labor on tobacco and tea farms, sub-
 sistence farms, and in domestic service. There is no special legal restriction on chil-
 dren's work hours.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The Ministry of Labor and Vocational Training
 sets separate urban and rural minimum wage rates based on recommendations of
 the Tripartite Wage Advisory Board comprised of representatives of labor govern-
 ment, and the private sector. The urban minimum wage amounts to about $0.59 per
 day (MK24.80), including $0.07 for rent; in all other areas it is roughly $0.42
 (MK17.50) per day, including $0.04 for rent. The minimum wage rates, revised in
 August, are insufficient to provide a worker and family with a decent standard of
 living. Wage earners tend to supplement their incomes through farming activities.
 The MOLVT lacks resources to effectively enforce the minimum wage. However, the
 minimum wage largely is irrelevant for the great majority of citizens who earn their
 livelihood outside the formal wage sector.
 The maximum legal workweek is 48 hours, with a mandatory weekly 24-hour rest
 period. The laws require payment for overtime work and prohibit compulsory over-
 time. In practice employers frequently violate statutory time restrictions. The law
 protects foreign workers in correct legal status. Illegal foreign workers are subject
 to deportation.
 The Workers' Compensation Act includes extensive occupational health and safety
 standards. Enforcement of these standards by the MOLVT is erratic. Workers-par-
 ticularly in industrial jobs-often work without basic safety clothing and equipment.
 Workers have the right to remove themselves from dangerous work situations with-
 out jeopardy to continued employment. However, given the low level of education
 of most workers and the high level of unemployment, they are unlikely to exercise
 this right. Workers dismissed for filing complaints about workplace conditions have
 the right to file a complaint at the labor office or sue the employer for wrongful dis-
 missal.
