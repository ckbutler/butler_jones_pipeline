 BURMA
 
 The Socialist Republic of the Union of Burma is the largest
 and most ethnically diverse country in mainland Southeast
 Asia. It is governed under a constitution adopted in 1974,
 which established a one-party parliamentary system with
 parallel government and party structures and a state-run
 economy.
 In August 1981, President U Ne Win announced his intention
 to give up the post of president after national elections.
 In November, Burma's newly elected unicameral legislature,
 or Pyithu Hluttaw, selected a new council of state.
 In keeping with the constitution, the duly elected chairman
 of the council of state, U San Yu, became president. U Ne
 Win has been the dominant political leader in Burma since
 1962, when military forces ousted the civilian government
 of Prime Minister U Nu. U Ne Win remains chairman of the
 Burma Socialist Programme Party (BSPP), and is expected
 to continue to guide Burma's political life for some time
 to come.
 Following the 1962 coup, opponents of the revolutionary
 government and regional separatists were jailed, generally
 without trial. Other political opponents went into exile
 abroad. Most of the jailed persons were released in the
 late 1960's and early 1970's, but it was not until 1978
 that a gradual relaxation of -government restrictions led
 to asignificant reduction in reports of human rights
 abuses. Criticism of government policy, however, is still
 limited to that voiced within the party/government structure.
 Criticism of the government outside of this structure is not
 tolerated.
 In 1980, President U Ne Win amnestied all exiles and
 insurgents who would return to Burma within 90 days.
 Almost 2,200 of the government's former opponents accepted
 the offer. In a related move, President U Ne Win invited
 former Prime Minister U Nu to return to live in Burma, and
 the offer was accepted. The president also announced an
 amnesty for political prisoners and convicted criminals,
 under which more than 15,000 people were released.
 A second step in the government's clemency program was the
 introduction of a system of awards and pensions to many
 people, including.political dissidents, who had played an
 active part in the Burmese independence movement and post-
 independence governments.
 Insurgency and ethnic separatism have been major problems
 for all Burmese governments since independence. Today,
 most insurgent groups, have turned to black-market and
 narcotics trafficking as a major source of financing their
 activities. While the government has confined the insurgents
 to remote and sparsely populated border areas, countering
 their activities is a significant drain on scarce national
 resources. In contested areas, there are recurrent but
 unconfirmed reports of human rights abuses by all parti-
 cipants in the fighting.
 In a major conciliatory move, the government entered into
 peace talks in late 1980 with the largest insurgent group,
 the Burma Communist Party (BCP). In May 1981, the govern-
 ment announced that these talks had broken down because of
 unacceptable BCP demands for legal status, an autonomous
 
 (558)
 
 
 559
 area under BCP control, and continued maintenance of the
 BCP armed forces. The government currently seeks to expand
 the participation of ethnic minorities in the party and the
 government.
 1.   Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 Persistent but unconfirmed reports suggest that the security
 arms of the government have used and continue to use
 physical and psychological coercion, including torture,
 during investigation of cases involving national security,
 major organized crime (including narcotics trafficking),
 and political opposition. There have also been unconfirmed
 reports that certain of the various insurgent groups active
 in Burma employ death threats, beatings, and other forms of
 mental and physical torture against villagers who resist
 them in the areas where they operate.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Except for the reports of abuses mentioned above, there
 is no confirmation of any intentional pattern of cruel,
 degrading, or discriminatory treatment or punishment.
 In part because of the generally low standard of living,
 conditions in Burmese prisons are poor. Prisons are
 overcrowded; diet and medical attention are limited.
 In addition to standard prisons, the government has estab-
 lished a system of work camps to which convicts are assigned
 for manual labor, including road building and quarry work.
 A system of temporary paroles permits convicts with good
 records to make short visits home from these camps.
 Summary executions and corporal punishment are not permitted
 under the Burmese judicial. system. No death sentences are
 known to have been implemented the past year, although
 capital punishment is permitted under Burmese law.
 There have been unconfirmed reports that some insurgent
 groups have carried out summary executions of suspected
 informers.
 c. Disappearances
 The government exercises broad powers of detention, but
 over the past year there have been no known cases of persons
 being held secretly or having "disappeared" for protracted
 periods or of attempts to hide arrests from family members
 or friends.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 A 1975 anti-subversion law permits indefinite detention.
 The government neither acknowledges holding political
 prisoners nor feels compelled to justify the detention
 or-imprisonment of any individual. The number of political
 prisoners is uncertain; some persons whose activities may
 have been considered political have also been charged with
 criminal offenses or with inciting violence; others have
 been released without trial. While the exact number of
 political prisoners is unknown, it is believed to be very
 low as a result of the May, 1980, amnesty described in the
 introduction.

 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The 1974 constitution provides for public trials. A limited
 number of cases involving intelligence or politically
 sensitive crimes are tried in camera and are closed to the
 public. The burden of proof is on the prosecution and the
 accused has the right to an attorney. Justice is admini-
 stered by a system of People's Courts with the right of
 appeal to higher levels (up to the National Council of
 People's Justices). Most judges are lay persons, untrained
 in law, who are selected by the party. Courts are advised
 by professional legal officers, some of whom are former
 judges. Civilians, even when charged with security
 offenses, are tried by the People's Courts rather than
 by courts martial.
 Court decisions are not determined solely by the codified
 law but are also affected by Burmese concepts of community
 harmony and fair play, as well as by Burmese socialist
 concepts.
 In normal practice, defendants can consult freely and
 privately with their lawyers, and defendants and defense
 lawyers are aware of the charges and evidence against them
 and are permitted to submit their own evidence. There have
 been allegations that these procedures are not always
 followed. In some political cases also, the government is
 alleged to have influenced the judgments and sentences.
 f. Invasion of the Home
 The 1974 constitution guarantees the privacy and security
 of the home. This right, however, is frequently abridged
 in practice by local authorities, government security
 forces, and insurgent groups.
 2.   Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 All mass media in Burma are government-owned and controlled.
 Journalists are subject to strict guidelines as to what can
 be broadcast or published, especially regarding political
 matters. All forms of communications -- domestic and
 imported books and periodicals, stage plays, motion
 pictures, musical recordings -- are subject to government
 control. In 1980, the government strengthened its control
 over literature published in Burma with the founding of a
 nationwide literary worker'a organization.  Public criticism
 of the government's leadership is not tolerated.
 Freedom of religion, guaranteed in the 1974 constitution,
 is widely observed in Burma, a largely Buddhist country with
 sizable Christian, Muslim, and animist minorities.
 Beginning in 1980, the government has sought to strengthen
 its links with and control over the Buddhist monkhood.
 The government appointed a National Buddhist Council
 empowered to regulate the monkhood; it instituted regulations
 requiring certification of monks by religious superiors
 and the government; and it also issued identification and
 residence cards to monks, which allow it to enforce residence
 and movement controls similar to those imposed on the rest
 of the population. During 1981, the National Buddhist
 Council, with government encouragement, began to carry out
 a "purification" of the Buddhist clergy. Under this program,
 several hundred monks have been disrobed on charges of
 
 
 561
 personal misconduct in violation of Buddhist religious
 canons. In keeping with a decision by Buddhist eccele-
 siastical courts, the government banned the activities
 and doctrine of two Buddhist sects in October 1981.
 Religious minorities are free to practice in Burma, but
 the government discourages close ties between Burmese
 congregations and international religious bodies.
 Political assembly and organizing are permitted only within
 the framework of the Burma Socialist Programme Party and
 its associated mass organizations. The party sponsors
 workers', peasants' and youth organizations, which provide
 some opportunity for ordinary citizens to express themselves
 politically. These organizations serve primarily, however,
 as vehicles for communicating national policies and
 implementing government programs. Secular organizations
 not approved by the government are banned.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration and Repatriation
 The 1974 constitution guarantees the right of Burmese
 citizens to live anywhere within Burma. Exceptions apply
 to areas of insurgent or military activity. Both citizens
 and non-citizen residentsof Burma are subject to travel
 restrictions and controls and must obtain permission to
 travel or to stay outside the township of their residence.
 Foreign travel is difficult, except for official purposes.
 Over the last two years lengthy bureaucratic and legal
 requirements for permission to travel abroad have been
 slightly streamlined. Nevertheless, issuance of travel
 documents is sometimes denied on political grounds.
 Emigration is permitted, but bureaucratic procedures are
 cumbersome. Prospective emigrants must reimburse the
 government for their university and professional education,
 and students who hqve completed certain government-financed
 professional studies abroad must put in a fixed number of
 years of government service before being permitted to resign
 or to emigrate. Some individuals of non-Burmese ancestry
 (for example, Indian or Chinese), although born and living
 in Burma, are considered foreign nationals under the
 present Burmese nationality regulations. In the event of
 emigration, they may be required to acquire foreign travel
 documents.
 The amnesty announced in May 1980, permitted Burmese exiles
 living abroad to return to Burma, and many prominent former
 politicians and insurgents took advantage of the offer.
 Former policies had virtually prohibited the return of
 Burmese-born emigres.
 Burma has not permitted the resettlement or granting of
 safehaven within Burma to foreign refugees. Informed
 sources have stated that several hundred ethnic Chinese
 refugees have been detained in Burmese prisons for having
 entered Burma illegally. There appears to be no significant
 outflow of refugees from Burma. Some Burmese Muslims of
 Malay ancestry have settled in northern Malaysia, but their
 primary motive for leaving Burma appears to be the search
 for a better economic life.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 The government of Burma is an authoritarian one-party
 system with the leadership drawn largely from the military
 officer corps. The single party is known as the Burma
 
 
 562
 Socialist Programme Party (BSPP). No other political
 groups are permitted. Political opposition is not
 tolerated.
 Although Burma has universal suffrage, the BSPP chooses
 the only slate of candidates.
 Occasionally the BSPP nominates non-party candidates.
 Participation in the BSPP is open to all adult citizens
 who meet candidacy requirements. Less than five percent
 of the adult population are full party members. Party
 membership is virtually a prerequisite for many government
 jobs. The party mechanism provides for modest political
 participation by an individual and allows limited self-
 criticism of bureaucratic failures.
 Persons with a significant proportion of non-Burmese
 ancestry (in practice, Chinese or Indian) are informally
 barred from higher party and government offices, and may
 be asked to resign from them if their mixed ancestry is
 discovered. BSPP Chairman U Ne Win in November 1981,
 called for legislation formalizing this procedure, but no
 action has yet been taken on his recommendation.
 There are hundreds of thousands of non-citizen residents
 of Burma, primarily of Chinese or Indian origin. Those
 holding foreign citizenship and proper documentation are
 eligible for registration as legal alien residents of Burma.
 Those lacking documentation are subject to deportation.
 Resident aliens are not eligible to attend graduate and
 professional schools, to join consumer cooperatives, or
 to take certain categories of employment. Internal travel
 of aliens is restricted. A new citizenship law which may
 affect the status of resident aliens is under consideration.
 An unknown but considerable number of residents of Burma
 neither have Burmese citizenship nor can obtain official
 documentation from another country. They are usually not
 able to emigrate, as Burma does not normally recognize
 stateless documentation for exit purposes.
 3.   Government Attitude and Record Regarding Inter-
 national and Non-governmental Investigation of
 Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 In the past, the Socialist Republic of the Union of Burma
 has not responded directly to rare foreign commentary on
 alleged human rights violations in Burma. During 1981,
 Burmese officials avoided meeting with a representative
 of a non-governmental human rights organization concerning
 a reported imprisonment of ethnic Chinese refugees.
 4.   Economic and Social Circumstances
 Burma remains one of the poorest nations in the world in
 terms of per capita income, which last year had only
 reached US$174. Burma is, however, nearly self-sufficient
 in food and energy.  (Burma has available for consumption
 106 percent of its caloric nutritional requirements, and
 imports only small quantities of specialized types of fuels.)
 In the last five years, Burma has made significant economic
 progress, reversing a long period of economic stagnation and
 decline. Over the past five years, because of a major
 infusion of capital from multilateral and bilateral donors
 and the successful implementation of high-yield variety
 programs in the agricultural sector, Burma's gross domestic
 product has risen at almost 7 percent a year, and topped 8.3
 
 
 563
 percent last year. (For comparison, the annual population
 growth rate is 2.2 percent.) Paddy production over the
 past four or five years has grown 45 percent, a significant
 achievement as 40 percent of Burma's foreign exchange
 earnings comes from rice.
 The Burmese government's egalitarian approach to development
 has assured access by a majority of the population to basic
 economic requirements. Government economic policies since
 1962 at first produced a decline in GDP growth rates, ending
 in a negative rate for Burmese fiscal year 1971/72.
 However, limited changes in policy have since turned this
 decline around, with GDP growth reaching 8.3 percent for
 Burmese fiscal year 1980/81 after four years of 6 percent
 annual growth. Burmese economic policies have also largely
 eliminated the extreme differentials in income that mark
 other developing economies. The Rangoon consumer price
 index has shown little increase over the past four years,
 and the official rate of inflation has remained less than
 5 percent annually over the same time period.
 As of 1974, according to official sources, Burma had a
 literacy rate of 67 percent. This may be significantly
 higher at present. In the last three years, the Burmese
 government has actively promoted an adult literacy campaign,
 and over one-half of the townships in Burma have already
 proclaimed complete victories over illiteracy. Education
 in Burma is free through the university level, but access
 to higher education beyond the tenth standard (grade) is
 controlled by a system of examinations.
 Construction in urban areas has not kept pace with popu-
 lation growth, and there is a shortage of housing in the
 major population centers. In other areas, Burma has been
 able to house its people adequately.
 Basic health care facilities are available throughout the
 country, and graduates of the institutes of medicine enter
 the Government Health Center directly for assignment in
 both rural and urban areas. Lack of resources, however,
 limits the effectiveness of the health care program, and
 there are shortages of a variety of drugs.
 Although the right to own property is guaranteed by law,
 the state retains residual rights to the disposition of
 land. Burma's land reform program in the countryside has
 been effective in eliminating rural tenancy.
 By law and tradition Burmese women may own land, obtain
 a higher education, enter the professions, and engage in
 business on the same basis as men. Women retain their names
 after marriage. Women are, however, under-represented in
 politics and in the senior levels of government, reflecting
 in part the military background of most of Burma's present
 leaders.
