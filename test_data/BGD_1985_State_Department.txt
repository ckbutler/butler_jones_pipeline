 BANGLADESH
 Bangladesh is governed by a Martial Law Administration (MLA)
 headed by President H.M. Ershad. Ershad, a General in the army
 who also holds the posts of Chief of Army Staff and Chief
 Martial Law Administrator, took power through a bloodless coup
 d'etat in March 1982 and became President in December 1983. In
 the coup, the military suspended the Constitution, dissolved
 the Parliament, and dismissed an ineffective, if popularly
 elected President. Martial law regulations give powers to
 General Ershad and to a three-level structure of martial law
 courts which are beyond judicial challenge in civil courts.
 In the exercise of these powers, the Martial Law Administration
 has generally been more restrained than its initial verbal
 assertion of unchecked powers would imply. As the military
 Government has become less preoccupied with eradicating
 corruption and more concerned with the normal chores of
 governing, encouraging economic development, implementing
 administrative decentralization and reform, and attracting
 civilian political support, the actual use of heavy-handed
 martial law measures has declined; abuse of individual rights
 by the security forces overall has been minimal. The regime is
 committed to holding elections and restoring constitutional
 government.
 Bangladesh is one the poorest and most densely populated
 agricultural countries in the world. Since an estimated 70
 percent of Bangladeshis subsist below an absolute poverty
 level, the MLA's avowed priority is economic development. Its
 key programs aim at increased agricultural yields, reduced
 population growth, administrative decentralization, and private
 sector development. An important goal in implementing its
 policies is the eradication of corruption and inefficiency.
 However, reports persist of widespread corruption within the
 MLA itself.
 The gradual liberalizing trend of 1984 continued into the early
 months of 1985 as the regime sought the cooperation of the
 major opposition parties in its plans to hold national
 elections. Negotiations between the Government and the parties
 had broken down three times during the course of the previous
 year, each time on the issue of the type of government which
 would be in place while elections are held; the parties have
 insisted that the MLA step aside to permit a "neutral"
 government to hold elections; the regime insists that martial
 law--suitably liberalized--be maintained until the elected
 government is available to take control. Following the third
 breakdown in negotiations, and to forestall threatened violent
 protests, the regime reimposed a harsher version of martial law
 than had been in force for the previous year. All political
 activity was banned from March I to October 1, martial law
 courts were reestablished, writs against the Government
 prohibited, censorship tightened, and--from March to July--the
 university closed.
 In a new effort to begin the process again of liberalizing the
 political system preparatory to elections, the Government
 relaxed many of these measures again on October 1, permitting
 the resumption of political activity so long as it was "indoor"
 (no mass-meetings, processions, etc.). Following the summit
 meeting of South Asian leaders in Dhaka in early December,
 there was a further announcement that the ban on political and
 
 
 1190
 BANGLADESH
 trade union activity would be totally relaxed on January 1,
 1986 amid renewed speculation that elections will be announced
 for the spring of 1986.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 Killing for directly political motives is not common in
 Bangladesh, although violence between factions, gangs, and
 economic adversaries sometimes assumes political coloration.
 Several persons were killed during confrontations among
 students, opposition political elements, and government
 security forces in 1985.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no confirmed reports of disappearance resulting from
 official action.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Police treatment of common prisoners is often rough, up to and
 including abusive interrogations and beatings. Fatalities from
 such mistreatment are rare. Incidents of police brutality are
 reported in the press regularly and Amnesty International, in
 its 1985 report, expressed concern about allegations of
 torture. Punishment of police and jail officials involved in
 mistreating a prisoner takes place in cases where the victim or
 his friends and family can attract publicity, but most
 mistreatment of obscure victims goes unpunished. Organized,
 systematic government-instigated violence against individuals
 is not characteristic of Bangladesh.
 Bangladesh's overcrowded jails reflect the country's extremely
 poor living conditions. In at least the larger prisons, the
 conditions under which prominent persons and political
 prisoners ("Class A" prisoners) are held are markedly better
 than those afforded ordinary criminals. In April 1983, a
 commission to study penal reform with an eventual goal of
 improving facilities and evolving from a penal to a
 correctional system was constituted. Due primarily to resource
 constraints, prospects for rapid implementation of prison
 reforms are slight.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 In general, whenever participation in demonstrations or other
 political activity has prompted the MLA summarily to arrest or
 detain individuals, authorities have sought to notify families
 expeditiously of the detained and arrested individuals'
 whereabouts. Such demonstrators and activists are seldom held
 for long. Opposition leaders arrested during the ban on all
 political activity in 1985 were held variously from several
 weeks to several months without trial, and then released; the
 total number of detainees during this period may have reached
 more than 1,000. Two of the most prominent detainees were
 Begum Khaleda Zia, leader of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party,
 and Sheikh Hasina Wazed, leader of the Awami League. Observers
 
 
 1191
 BANGLADESH
 estimate that the number of persons in custody for offenses
 other than common law ones does not exceed 100.
 Martial law regulations authorize arrest on reasonable
 suspicion that the suspect has committed an offense and do not
 provide for habeas corpus. However, the suspension of habeas
 corpus is in practice only partial, and it is now possible in
 limited circumstances to bring writs against the Government.
 Offenses under these regulations include criticism of martial
 law, creation of panic, political activity, interference with
 the defense service, corruption, and smuggling.
 The Special Powers Act of 1974 remains in effect. Under this
 law, persons may be detained without charge for 24 hours, held
 with the consent of a magistrate for 30 days, and held
 indefinitely with government approval.
 During the past year, Bangladeshi legal and human rights
 organizations have exposed several cases of people arrested on
 minor charges who have remained in jail without trial,
 forgotten for 5 to 10 years. In the past, over half of the
 prison population was reportedly undergoing or awaiting trial.
 There is no forced labor.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 While several special martial law courts still exist, most
 civil and criminal cases are heard by civilian courts in public
 trials in which the right to counsel is respected. Processing
 cases can be both time-consuming and expensive, working a
 hardship on the vast majority of litigants and discouraging
 many from seeking redress through the courts. However, fair
 public trials do not appear to be intentionally denied.
 Under new regulations which apply to civilian courts, if
 investigation has not been completed and charges have not been
 filed in an ordinary case within 90 days, the case must be
 dismissed and the prisoner freed. To accomplish the goal of
 speedy justice, these regulations also broaden the powers of
 the police and lower courts and limit appeal rights in minor
 cases. There are no indications that these enlarged powers and
 more summary procedures have been misused by the police or
 lower magistrates. It is not clear, however, how widely they
 have been implemented.
 The Martial Law Administration has undertaken the dispersal of
 magistrate courts to the newly established Upazilla
 (subdistrict) level of government, and administrative
 decentralization of the high court appellate judiciary benches
 which currently sit in six cities outside Dhaka.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Bangladesh authorities do not normally engage in arbitrary
 invasion of the home. For the civil court system, a judicial
 warrant is required before authorities enter a home, and courts
 require evidence of a reasonable basis of suspicion of
 involvement in a crime before issuing a warrant. Martial law
 regulations provide for entry and search of the home under the
 same conditions but extend these powers to both military and
 police authorities. MLA officials have been known to enter the
 homes of opposition leaders without warrants; individuals have
 
 
 1192
 BANGLADESH
 been detained and premises searched. This practice was
 especially prevalent during the early days of the martial law
 crackdown from March 1 to October 1, 1985. Wiretaps are not
 widely employed, although they are believed to be used
 selectively. It is also believed that the authorities
 occasionally monitor the correspondence of selected
 individuals. The Government maintains civilian and military
 intelligence services which concern themselves, in part, with
 domestic events, and whose influence and capability, although
 not pervasive, may be growing.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Government owns and operates all radio and television
 facilities and owns and controls one of the four
 English-language dailies, two vernacular dailies, and one
 weekly. Most of the many Bengali-language periodicals and
 newspapers are privately owned. A number of nongovernmental
 newspapers are supported by political parties and reflect
 various political views. Major papers carry a balance of news
 from the Government and the opposition. The Bangladesh news
 media avoid explicit criticism of the Government on topics
 perceived as particularly sensitive. The Government has
 detained and tried journalists for writing articles critical of
 martial law (an offense under martial law regulations), but all
 such persons eventually have been released.
 The Government exercises authority to ban foreign and domestic
 publications. A lengthy ban on the Bengali-language newspaper
 Dainik Desh was lifted in May 1985 after its owner joined a
 political party faction aligned with the MLA. In September
 1985, Jai Din, a weekly of political analysis and commentary
 opposed to the MLA, was banned. Jai Din joins two other
 publications, Ittehad (banned in October 1984) and Jooi Jatra
 (banned in August 1984). that are still prohibited from
 publishing.
 On March 1, 1985, when it banned all political activity, the
 Government also closed all the universities. The universities
 were reopened in July. In September 1985, repeated clashes
 between progovernment and antigovernment students at Dhaka
 University prompted the Vice Chancellor to request police
 intervention. Eighty-nine nonresident students and outsiders
 were arrested. Periodic violent clashes between rival student
 groups are common.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The original martial law regulations prohibited any activity by
 a political party, any meeting of a political nature, and any
 gathering of over 100 people with the exception of cultural,
 literary, or religious events. The Government relaxed this ban
 in 1983 by authorizing indoor political gatherings. It later
 lifted the remaining restrictions and allowed free political
 activity, which culminated in a series of general strikes and
 demonstrations in the fall of 1984.
 In 1985 this pattern repeated itself. On March 1 all political
 activities were again banned in connection with the
 presidential referendum and Upazilla elections. The
 Government's justification was that the voters should decide
 the issue in a calm atmosphere free of agitation and
 
 
 1193
 BANGLADESH
 disruption. The ban on political activity was progressively
 relaxed throughout the summer of 1985. The opposition parties
 began to hold indoor meetings, and reports of the meetings
 appeared in the press.
 The ban on political activity was officially loosened to allow
 "indoor politics" again beginning October 1, and further
 loosened to allow full political activity as of January 1,
 1986. Elections will possibly be held in the spring of 1986.
 Workers in Bangladesh normally enjoy the right to associate
 freely, to organize, and to bargain collectively. A ban on
 trade union activity instituted in March 1985 was lifted on
 January 1, 1986. Because of a low level of industrialization,
 labor unions represent no more than five percent of the work
 force. Although only a small portion of the work force is
 unionized, unions are powerful and important in certain key
 sectors--jute, tea, the railroad, and the national airline.
 Unions are heavily involved in politics; of 17 trade union
 federations, only 1 claims no political affiliation. Most
 unions are urban-based and serve as fronts for political
 parties. These unions participate actively in the general
 strikes and rallies mounted by the country's political
 parties. Bangladesh has a progressive labor law, but it is
 often ignored by both management and labor. Unions need no
 prior permission from the Government to form; however, the
 Government does supervise union elections, which gives it the
 power to influence those elections should it choose to do so.
 Unions are free to draw up their own constitutions and rules,
 elect their representatives, and formulate their programs.
 There are no restrictions on joining confederations and
 affiliating with international organizations. Individuals do
 need government clearance to travel to international labor
 conferences and attend programs sponsored by foreign labor
 institutions; such clearances are routinely granted. Under
 Bangladesh's labor law the Government can suspend or dissolve
 individual unions; in 1983 the National Registrar of Trade
 Unions withdrew recognition from a number of trade unions for
 noncompliance with technical provisions of the labor law. In
 theory, Bangladeshi workers have participatory rights in all
 union business; in practice, that right is often violated by
 both employers and union leaders. In theory, unions and their
 members are fully protected against antiunion discrimination;
 in practice, employers regularly fire workers for union
 activities and harass union activists and leaders. Antiunion
 discrimination is especially prey-alent in the garment industry,
 most of whose workers are young women. Employers, through
 connections in the Government and the military, often have any
 legal actions that unions might file against them forgotten or
 quashed. Reportedly, this is especially true in the garment
 industry where many factories are owned by active and retired
 army officers.
 A coalition of 14 trade union federations (SKOP) led a 48-hour
 general strike in December 1984 with the support of the major
 political parties after the Government failed to implement
 fully an agreement on wages and other benefits reached by the
 SKOP in May 1984. Talks between SKOP and the Government were
 concluded on February 18, 1985, with agreement on amendments to
 the Industrial Relations Ordinance and the Employment of Labor
 Act. On March 1, 1985, the Government banned all trade union
 and political activities. A number of trade union leaders who
 actively supported political parties were arrested; nearly all
 
 
 1194
 
 BANGLADESH
 were released by year's end. On January 1, 1986 political
 parties as well as trade unions were again permitted a full
 range of activity.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Bangladesh is predominantly Islamic. Conversion from one
 religion to another is permitted. Proselytizing by Bangladeshi
 citizens is allowed under Article 41 of the Constitution,
 subject to law, public order, and morality. Proselytization is
 largely directed toward minority groups such as Hindus and
 tribals. There is strong social resistance against efforts to
 convert persons from the majority Muslim religion. Certain
 Islamic organizations continue to voice concern over Christian
 missionary activities and the conversion of Muslims to
 Christianity. All Bangladesh governments have pledged equality
 of treatment and-freedom of worship to Hindu, Buddhist, and
 Christian minorities, who combined constitute approximately 17
 percent of the population. Although this policy is
 substantially respected, the numerical predominance of Muslims
 and South Asia's history of communal violence and
 discrimination contribute to minority concern.
 Members of minority religious groups are disadvantaged in
 practice although not by law in their access to government
 positions and political office. Members of some minorities,
 principally Hindus, have lost or had serious difficulty
 retaining their properties as a result of prejudicial
 administration of vested property laws which provide that
 property belonging to persons who left Bangladesh between 1965
 and 1971 shall be managed by the Government. The Government is
 authorized to use and to sell this property, which it has
 sometimes done to the disadvantage of former owners. In
 October 1983, the Government announced the establishment of
 three religious welfare trusts for the Hindu, Buddhist, and
 Christian communities.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Bangladesh citizens are free to move within the country, but
 there are designated "protected areas" near the borders and
 certain other locations from which all nonresidents may be
 banned. Bangladeshis are generally free to visit or emigrate
 abroad, subject to foreign exchange controls. In some
 instances, persons deemed to be security risks have not been
 allowed to travel abroad. Civil servants must obtain
 "no-objection certificates" from the ministry in which they are
 employed before traveling abroad, and citizens going overseas
 to work must register with the ministry responsible for
 manpower export. The right of repatriation is observed.
 Although the Government has no stated policy on refugee and
 asylum matters, in 1979 it provided temporary asylum to sizable
 groups of Arakanese Muslim refugees from Burma.
 Approximately 250,000 non-Bengali Muslim Biharis or "stranded
 Pakistanis" remain in Bangladesh, pending resettlement in
 Pakistan. After independence in 1971, these non-Bengalis opted
 for Pakistani citizenship. Pakistan has agreed to take them
 back provided financing for resettlement costs, estimated at
 $500 million, is made available from outside sources. A
 Saudi-based Islamic social organization is actively seeking to
 raise the money. Camp dwellers may seek employment and conduct
 
 
 1195
 BANGLADESH
 other activities, but face disadvantages as noncitizens. Some
 Biharis have lost property as a result of laws confiscating
 Pakistani holdings, but those Biharis who chose to become
 Bangladeshi citizens in 1971 are entitled to full rights of
 citizenship.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 The average Bangladeshi citizen has little opportunity to
 exercise the right to self-government. Such elections as are
 held are held at the pleasure of the Government, not by the
 authority of a constitution. In those elections the Government
 determines the issues and the terms under which political
 parties can participate.
 Throughout the year, the Government displayed a continuing
 commitment to hold elections and restore constitutional
 government. Twice the government has scheduled national
 elections--in December 1984 and April 1985--and twice the main
 opposition political alliances refused to participate, fearing
 that the Government would use martial law powers to influence
 the process. Following the ban on all political activity, the
 Government held a referendum on March 21 which endorsed the
 Government's policies and permitted President Ershad to remain
 in power until national elections are carried out. The
 opposition boycotted the presidential referendum and carried
 out an unsuccessful campaign of violence and intimidation to
 disrupt the polling. Although the referendum was a victory for
 the President, the turnout was far lower than that claimed by
 the Government. On May 16 and 20, the Government held nonparty
 elections at the local level for Upazilla (subdistrict)
 chairmen, postponed the previous year because of an opposition
 boycott. The opposition boycotted again, but failed, despite a
 second campaign of violence, to prevent nomination and
 polling. The election was marked by reports of substantial
 vote tampering, but much of this appears to have been done by
 individual candidates, and not by the Government.
 Progovernment candidates won a majority of the seats.
 President Ershad has indicated that national elections may be
 held in the spring of 1986.
 After independence in 1972, and again between 1976 and 1982,
 members of Bangladesh's elite endeavored to establish a
 democratic form of government by framing a constitution and
 experimenting with parliamentary and presidential systems.
 Nonetheless, Bangladesh has spent 8 of its 14 years since
 independence under martial law, both contributing to and
 reflecting the weakness of its political institutions, the
 staggering magnitude of its economic problems, and a belief
 among the military that it is the only national institution
 able to bear responsibility for national affairs.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Several international nongovernmental human rights
 organizations, including Amnesty International, the
 International League for Human Rights, and the International
 Commission of Jurists, are represented in Bangladesh. The
 Government has not obstructed independent outside
 investigations of alleged human rights violations.
 
 
 1196
 BANGLADESH
 In its 1985 report, Amnesty International noted that several
 hundred political prisoners were released during 1984 but that
 government opponents engaged in nonviolent protests continued
 to face arrest and detention, and it expressed concern at
 reports of the torture of criminal suspects in police custody,
 the ill-treatment of detained students, and extrajudicial
 executions by law enfor6ement personnel in the Chittagong Hill
 Tracts. Freedom House rates Bangladesh "partly free." Several
 Bangladeshi organizations and individual lawyers are active in
 defending human rights through publicity designed to inform
 people of their rights, the provision of legal aid to the poor,
 and challenges in the courts. The majority of cases brought to
 and handled by these organizations involve the rights of
 pretrial prisoners and the treatment of women.
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 In Bangladesh, efforts to induce economic growth confront
 serious obstacles. The 100 million people live in 55,000
 square miles, making Bangladesh the most densely populated
 agrarian country in the world. The population growth rate is
 about 2.8 percent per year. Nearly half the population is
 under 14 years of age. With the exception of natural gas and
 fertile alluvial soil, the country lacks natural resources.
 Annual per capita income amounts to only about $130 per year.
 Funds for investment, as well as the transportation and
 communications infrastructure, are extremely limited. In
 fiscal year 1985 approximately 75 percent of the development
 budget came from foreign aid; this figure is projected to
 increase to as high as 84 percent in the fiscal year 1986.
 Bangladesh's agricultural sector accounts for approximately 74
 percent of employment. The share of agricultural production in
 the gross domestic product (GDP) has fluctuated from 47.1 to
 45.7 percent over the last four years. The economy is highly
 susceptible to fluctuations in the world market, commodity
 prices, and especially the vagaries of nature. The low-lying
 land and dependence on monsoon rains, combined with extremely
 simple farming methods, mean that a tropical storm or a few
 weeks variation in rainfall patterns can change subsistence
 into famine in a particular locality. After near record floods
 in 1984, the country was hit by a tidal wave in 1985 that
 killed thousands and displaced hundreds of thousands. The
 difficulties presented by the nature of the land and climate
 are compounded by social factors. Approximately one-half of
 the rural households are effectively landless. The average
 farm size is approximately 3.5 acres, typically with several
 plots, widely separated from one another, constituting a single
 holding. Gains in food production have been offset in large
 part by population growth, and Bangladesh still has an annual
 food deficit.
 Bangladesh's industrial and service sectors are small,
 employing approximately 10 percent of the labor force and
 contributing about 9 percent to GDP. While no accurate
 measurements of unemployment and underemployment exist, both
 are pervasive and are estimated as high as 40 percent
 nationally. Women are virtually absent from the cash work
 force, except in the export-oriented garment industry. Their
 wages lag behind those of men, even for the same work.
 In addition to its large development program, which includes
 agricultural modernization, road building, rural
 electrification, and delivery of family planning and health
 
 
 1197
 BANGLADESH
 services, the Government has instituted industrial and tax
 policies to strengthen the private sector in an effort to
 encourage the growth of productive industry. Despite
 government inducements, relatively few industries have located
 in rural areas because the basic infrastructure of
 transportation, communication, and electrification is
 inadequate. The poverty of Bangladesh is evident in the poor
 health and nutritional standards of the country. Life
 expectancy at birth is 50 years. The infant mortality rate is
 approximately 140 deaths per 1,000 live births. Only 35
 percent of the population has access to safe water. On a per
 capita basis, nutritional intake indicates a downward trend
 over the last 15 years.
 Literacy appears to be declining overall, and exhibits a marked
 disparity between males and females and between urban and rural
 dwellers. Despite the Government's commitment to expand
 primary, secondary, and technical schooling, broad-based modern
 education is far from a reality and rapid population growth is
 overwhelming those facilities which do exist. The
 technological level of capital and human assets is rudimentary,
 and the exodus of educated and trained persons, given the
 meager base, is substantial.
 Bangladesh's labor law stipulates minimum ages for various
 types of employment; in industries where unions are strong
 these minimums are enforced, but the poverty of the country is
 such that children are regularly engaged in any line of work
 they can get, especially fieldwork. In general, regulations
 regarding minimum wages, hours of work, and occupational safety
 and health are not strictly enforced.
 Underlying attitudes and social barriers circumscribing the
 participation of women in activities beyond the home are
 strongly entrenched and show few signs of weakening. For the
 approximately 86 percent of Bangladeshi women who live in rural
 areas, early marriage, high child-bearing rates, and long hohrs
 of household labor leave little opportunity for nonfamily
 interests or outside employment. No culturally acceptable
 alternative to marriage exists for women (or men), and
 childlessness is viewed as a personal catastrophe. Even in
 urban areas and among the affluent, the traditional social
 system makes women economically dependent on their husbands or
 other male relatives.
 By custom and by Islamic tradition, women occupy a subordinate
 place and receive unequal treatment before the law on a
 widespread basis. The ability of a family to seclude its women
 is a symbol of middle or high social status; poverty forces a
 grim equality of the workplace. The daily press testifies to a
 pattern of domestic violence (murder, rape, torture), breach of
 matrimonial contract, denial of inheritance rights, and
 desertion which victimizes women and which is particularly
 acute among the poor. The rate of suicide among women is
 reportedly almost three times higher than among men. In
 October 1983, the Government promulgated a stringent ordinance
 to deter such cruelties to women as murder, kidnapping,
 abduction, and trafficking in women. The ordinance brings
 together the various statutes applicable to women and stiffens
 the penalties for abuse. It provides the death penalty for
 those directly responsible for a "dowry killing" or for killing
 a woman in the course of a rape, although it does not address
 the abuse of a woman stopping short of murder or rape or taking
 place within the family or home. "Dowry killings" usually
 
 
 1198
 BANGLADESH
 share a common theme: the bride's family has not made full
 payment of a supposedly promised dowry, so the husband or his
 family attacks and sometimes murders the bride.
 A simmering guerrilla movement bred of social disruption,
 economic decline, and spiritual demoralization continued
 through 1985 among the approximately 400,000 tribal people who
 inhabit the Chittagong Hill Tracts, a geographically and
 socially atypical part of an otherwise homogeneous country.
 The predominantly Buddhist tribal population has been alienated
 by the Government's claim to land which the indigenous people
 regard as tribal property. Over the past decade, successive
 governments have settled close to 300,000 ethnic Bengalis in
 that territory, radically altering the ethnic balance in the
 area from 90 percent tribal in 1947 to 54 percent tribal in
 1981. This population shift is continuing, although no longer
 officially encouraged. Sporadic clashes pitting police, army,
 and border patrol units against tribal insurgents continue.
 Although the number of deaths is believed to be low, no
 reliable statistics are available.
 Conditions in the Chittagong Hill Tracts lend credence to
 charges of human rights abuses by the army and Bengali
 settlers. Contact between tribals and foreigners traveling in
 the area is actively discouraged by the Government. In an
 attempt to end the insurgency, the Government announced in
 October 1983 an amnesty for all guerrillas effective through
 February 1985. The program has since been extended. In May
 1985, over 200 members of one of the guerrilla factions
 surrendered to government forces. Although the Government
 considers its new policy generous, the antigovernment tribal
 leadership continues to demand the preservation of the
 autonomous culture of the Chakmas and other tribes rather than
 integration into Bengali Islamic culture. In particular, the
 guerrillas continue to call for an end to Bengali settlement in
 the Chittagong Hill Tracts.
