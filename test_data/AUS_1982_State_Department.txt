 AUSTRALIA
 Australia is a multi-party parliamentary democracy. Voting is
 compulsory for those over the age of 18. The Australian
 Federal Parliament consists of a 125-member House of
 Representatives and a 64-member Senate. Seats in the House of
 Representatives are allocated among the states and territories
 according to population. The Senate consists of ten members
 from each of the six states and two members from each of the
 two territories. The next federal elections are scheduled to
 take place no later than November 1983.
 Australia has an advanced industrial economy with a high per
 capita income and government programs that provide economic
 support for the relatively disadvantaged elements of the
 population. The Government is committed to maintaining minimum
 standards of health and well-being for all Australians.
 Australia has actively supported immigration into Australia and
 has also taken a very large number of refugees in proportion to
 its population. As a result, the Australian population now
 includes a significant mixture of ethnic groups, both European
 and Asian.
 Australia has been in the forefront of those countries
 promoting human rights both domestically and internationally.
 Fundamental human rights are guaranteed by law and respected in
 practice. Protection of the rights of Australia's 180,000
 aboriginals is of particular concern to the Government. Racial
 discrimination is prohibited by law. The Government recognizes
 that aboriginals are a disadvantaged group and has provided
 special programs and assistance. During 1981-1982 the federal
 Government provided more than $228 million for aboriginal
 advancement programs.
 Human rights are fully protected in Australia. There is full
 participation in the political process and individuals are not
 subject to infringements of person or property. The Government
 makes a major effort to investigate reports of discrimination
 and to implement fully laws protecting the individual.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom frome
 a. Killing
 There were in 1982 no known instances of politically-motivated
 killings in Australia by either the Government or by domestic
 opposition groups. In the past there have been incidents of
 violence by terrorist groups supporting foreign causes, but no
 .such incidents occurred in 1982.
 b. Disappearance
 There have been no reports of "politically-motivated
 disappearances in Australia.
 c.  Torture
 Torture is not condoned in Australia, and there are no reports
 that it is practiced. Protection against torture and cruel
 treatment derives from English common law. Perpetrators would
 be punishable under criminal law governing assault, battery,
 and malicious wounding.
 
 
 661
 d. Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 Australian law prohibits cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment
 or punishment, and this prohibition is respected in practice.
 Abuse of prisoners and use of excessive force by police are not
 condoned, and there are adequate procedures to deal with
 offenders. Prison and detention facilities provide adequate
 shelter, food, and medical care. Prisoners' families and
 lawyers are allowed freely to visit them.
 e. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 Australian law prohibits arbitrary arrest and imprisonment and
 this prohibition is respected in practice. Arrested
 individuals must be brought before a magistrate without undue
 delay. Writs of habeas corpus are available to ensure that
 persons are not arrested without charges being brought against
 them promptly and to guarantee their right to apply to the
 courts for release pending trial. Preventive detention is not
 practiced.
 f. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Australian law guarantees the right to a fair hearing, the
 right to a fair public trial and the unimpeded right of
 counsel. There are no reports that these guarantees are denied
 in practice. Public assistance is available for those unable
 to pay for legal counsel. Defendants are informed in advance
 of charges and have pre-trial access to evidence against them.
 By law defendants are entitled to call and cross-examine
 witnesses and are protected against self-incrimination and
 double jeopardy. Australians are protected by law against ex
 ptt facto criminal prosecutions. The Australian judiciary-Ts
 ndependent. Judges are appointed by the executive branch and
 remain in office until retirement or resignation. Civilians
 are tried in civil courts and have the right of appeal to
 higher courts.
 g. Invasion of the Home
 Under Australian law and in practice, no search may be
 conducted without a judicially issued warrant. The Australian
 federal police may make use of listening devices in national
 security and narcotics investigations, with authorization from
 the judiciary.
 2. Respect for Civil and Political Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 These basic rights are guaranteed in law and respected in
 practice. Private enterprise plays the dominant role in the
 media and there is no press censorship. Opposition parties are
 completely free to express their viewpoints. There is no
 political censorship of books or artistic works. There is full
 academic freedom.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Freedom of assembly is guaranteed in Australia. Occasionally
 there have been complaints that the laws or regulations of a
 particular state limit assembly. For example, in Western
 Australia, the Police Act, as amended, requires that advance
 permission be obtained from the Commissioner of Police or an
 authorized officer before a procession or a public meeting can
 be held in a public place. The Commissioner may not withhold
 
 
 662
 permission unless he has reasonable grounds to believe the
 .meeting will imperil public safety. Only infrequently has
 permission to hold a meeting at a specific place been denied
 because of concern about public safety. Upon several
 occasions, however, individuals, mostly trade unionists, have
 been arrested and fined for holding meetings without obtaining
 permission in advance.
 Australian trade unions are strong, well organized, and active
 both in politics and in industrial relations. Approximately
 54% of the Australian working force is unionized. The rights
 to organize, strike, bargain collectively, and lobby are
 guaranteed in law and exercised in practice (including by
 government employees) .
 c. Freedom of Religion
 There is complete freedom of religion in Australia. There is
 no established church and there are no restrictions on
 religious activities or membership. Religious affiliation does
 .not affect civil, political, economic, or other secular status.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel,
 Emigration, and Repatriation
 There are no restrictions on movement within or outside of
 Australia including the right of emigration and repatriation.
 Race is barred as a criterion for approval or rejection of
 application to immigrate to Australia. Australia has been in
 the forefront of countries accepting refugees for
 resettlement. Since 1975, Australia has taken more than 65,500
 refugees from Indochina. In addition, Australia has welcomed
 significant numbers of refugees from elsewhere in the world,
 including Eastern Europe, and the Middle East.
 e. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 As a multi-party parliamentary democracy, Australians
 participate in their Government through a two-chamber
 parliament, elected by popular vote, voting is compulsory.
 State electoral procedures are set by each individual state.
 Occasionally there have been complaints that certain amendments
 relating to the enrollment and voting procedures of the state
 of Western Australia have had the effect of restricting the
 right of aborigines to vote.
 3. Government Attitude Regarding International and Non-
 governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations of
 Human Rights
 The Federal Racial Discrimination Act of 1975 prohibits all
 forms of racial discrimination based on color, race, ethnic
 background, or place of birth. In 1982, the High Court of
 Australia upheld the constitutionality of this Act some
 provisions of which had been challenged by the state of
 Gueensland in 1981. Under the 1975 Act an annual report has
 been prepared by the Commissioner for Community Relations, an
 exercise which has proved an effective instrument for achieving
 greater equality of opportunity and enjoyment of human rights
 for the entire Australian community.
 In 1981 Parliament approved the creation of an Australian Human
 Rights Commission which has assumed responsibility for the
 administration of the Racial Discrimination Act. The
 Commission is charged with promoting the observance of human
 rights by monitoring Commonwealth laws and regulations, hearing
 complaints, and making recommendations to the Government. The
 
 
 663
 Commission is authorized to cooperate with state governments on
 human rights matters under state jurisdiction. The Human
 Rights Commission actively investigates reports of social
 discrimination in Australia. Dring the first six months of
 1982 the Commission received more than 350 complaints for its
 review and investigation. Approximately one-third of the
 complaints related to aboriginal people.
 The Australian aboriginals traditionally were a racially
 distinct people living as hunter-gatherers and dispersed across
 Australia. At the time of European settlement about 200 years
 ago, it is estimated that there were about 300,000 aboriginals
 spread throughout Australia. They comprised 500 tribes,
 speaking about 200 different languages. There are now about
 180,000 aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders in Australia -
 more than one per cent of the country's population.
 The Government acknowledges that the aboriginal population is
 disadvantaged in such areas as education, housing, health, and
 employment. The Government has a range of programs aimed at
 providing to aborigines services available to other
 Australians, plus additional services to improve their
 socio-economic conditions. In 1981, a World Council of
 Churches delegation visited Australia and later issued a report
 which questioned the Government's efforts to help the
 aborigines. In response, government officials acknowledged
 that there were still deficiencies in aboriginal conditions,
 but pointed to the significant progress that has been made in
 past years and underlined the Government's continuing
 commitment to improving aboriginal welfare.
 The question of land rights on aboriginal reserves has been of
 continuing controversy in Australia. This question is
 primarily the responsibility of state governments. In some
 states land reserved for aboriginals has been vested in
 aboriginal land trusts as freehold land. In Queensland the
 state Government has proposed a grant of dbed in trust, rather
 than freehold tenure, but this has not been accepted by
 aboriginal groups who argue that it does not provide adequately
 secure land tenure for the aboriginal inhabitants of reserves.
 Australia has ratified the International Convention on the
 Elimination of all Forms of Racial Discrimination and reports
 biennially to the UN Committee on the Elimination of Racial
 Discrimination. It is the Government of Australia's policy to
 respond to all communications transmitted by the United Nations
 Secretary General which allege violations of human rights in
 Australia. The Government has also replied to cases raised by
 the London-based Anti-Slavery Society and the Minority Rights
 Group regarding complaints by aborigines.
 There are a number of organizations in Australia which are
 active, strong, and independent monitors and protectors of
 human rights, including the Australian Chapter of the
 International Commission of Jurists and the Australian Council
 of Civil Libertarians. In addition, the Office of the
 Commonwealth Ombudsman, established in 1977, is empowered to
 investigate complaints concerning administrative actions of
 Commonwealth government departments, statutory bodies, and
 other authorities. Whenever maladministration is found to
 occur, the Ombudsman is required to report to the body
 concerned and may include recommendations for remedy. In the
 event of a failure to comply with a recommendation, the
 Ombudsman may report the matter to the Prime Minister and
 Parliament.

 4. Economic, Social, and Cultural Situation
 Australia enjoys one of the highest living standards in the
 world. In 1981, the per capita Gross National Product was
 $9,818.1 and the infant mortality rate was 11 per thousand live
 births. Life expectancy at birth was 73.7 years in 1980. The
 population of Australia in 1981 was 14.8 million and the 1980
 population growth rate was 1.7%. Adult literacy is effectively
 100%. About 28 percent of the budget is devoted to social
 security and welfare. Basic food, shelter, health care, and
 social security benefits are guaranteed for the entire
 population, including recent immigrants.
