 BRAZIL
 Brazil is a constitutional federal republic composed of 26 states and the federal
 district. The federal legislative branch exercises authority independent of the execu-
 tive branch. On October 4, voters reelected President Fernando Henrique Cardoso
 to a second 4-year term. Citizens also cast votes for all 513 federal deputies, one-
 third of the Senate, and for governors and state assemblies. This marked the third
 time since the end of military rule in 1985 that citizens freely chose their president
 and elected the legislative bodies in accordance with the 1988 Constitution. All par-
 ties are able to compete on the basis of fair and equal procedures. The judiciary is
 independent but inefficient and subject to influence.
 Police forces fall primarily under the control of the states. State police are divided
 into two forces: The civil police, who have an investigative role, and the uniformed
 police, known officially as the "military police," who are responsible for maintaining
 public order. Although the individual state governments control the uniformed po-
 lice, the Constitution provides that they can be called into active military service
 in the event of an emergency, and they maintain some military characteristics and
 privileges, including a separate judicial system. In September 1997, the Justice Min-
 istry created a public security secretariat to coordinate efforts to reorganize and
 modernize the police forces. The federal police force is very small, primarily inves-
 tigative, and plays little role in maintaining internal security. The state police forces
 committed numerous serious human rights abuses.
 Brazil has a market-based, diversified economy. The Government, which tradition-
 ally played a dominant role in shaping economic development, is encouraging great-
 er private sector participation in the economy through privatization of state enter-
 prises, deregulation, and removal of impediments to competition. Industrial produc-
 tion, including mining operations and a large and diversified capital goods sector,
 accounts for approximately 34 percent of gross domestic product (GDP); agriculture
 contributes about 13 percent. Brazil exports both manufactured and primary goods.
 Among the principal exports are coffee, soybeans, textiles, leather, meagial
 products, and transportation equipment. Per capita GDP was about $5,000 in 1998
 and the economy grew at a rate of 0.5 percent. Although income distribution im-
 p roved sightly in 1998, it remained highly skewed, and the poorest half of the popu-
 lation received only 10 percent of national income while the richest tenth received
 48 percent.
 Te Government generally respected the human rights of its citizens, but there
 continued to be numerous serious abuses. State police forces (both civil and uni-
 formed police) committed many extrajudicial killings, and the police also tortured
 suspects under interrogation, arbitrarily detained persons, and conducted illegal
 searches. Off-duty police were implicated in killings or hire, kidnapings for ransom,
 and other abuses. Prison officials often beat inmates to maintain order. The state
 governments concerned did not punish most perpetrators of these abuses effectively.
 Wie state police forces dismissed increasing numbers of police officers for improper
 or criminal behavior, police tribunals (special cour~ts for the uniformed police) re-
 mained overloaded, rarely investigated cases thoroughy, and seldom convicted abus-
 ers. The separate system of uniformed police tribunas contributes to a climate of
 impunity for police officers involved in extrajudicial killings or abuse of prisoners.
 Legislation enacted in 1996 gave civil courts jurisdiction over intentional homicide
 committed by uniformed police officers but left control of the initial inquiry in the
 hands of the police, which can preempt investigation and prosecution of cases.
 The poor bear the brunt of most violence. Prison conditions range from poor to
 harsh. The judiciary has a large case backiog and often is unable to ensur he eright
 to a fair and speedy trial. Justice is slow and often unreliable, especially in rural
 areas where some powerful landowners use violence to settle land disputes and in-
 fluence the local judiciary. Violence against women, racial minorities, and homo-
 sexualss a problem. Discrimination against women and religions and racial minori-
 
 
 ties is also a problem. Child prostitution and abuse are problems. Despite constitu-
 tional provisions safegarding the rights of indigenous people, government authori-
 ties fail to protect them adequately from outsiders who encroach on their lands and
 fail to provide them with aequate health care and other basic services in many
 areas. However, the Government has demarcated 115,000 square miles of indige-
 nous lands in the past 4 years, and about 11 percent of the country is identified
 for the roughly 330,000 indigenous people. The authorities do not adequately enforce
 laws against forced labor, including that by children. Illegal child labor is a serious
 problem.
 Established in April 1997, the National Secretariat of Human Rights in the Jus-
 tice Ministry oversees the implementation of a 1996 Action Plan to address human
 rights abuses. The Government continued its inter-ministerial campaigns against
 child labor and expanded its scholarship program to keep primary and secondary
 students in school. However, because of jurisdictional and resource limitations, the
 efforts of the Federal Government had an uneven and limited impact in many of
 the states where human rights violations are most common.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-Extrajudicial killings continued to
 be a serious problem throughout the country. In urban areas, high crime rates, a
 low standard of police training, failure to apprehend most criminals, and an inept
 and inefficient criminal justice system all contribute to police brutality and killings
 of criminal suspects. Human rights groups report that the uniformed police often
 summarily execute suspected criminals rather than apprehend them and then file
 false reports describing the executions as shootouts. The Permanent Forum against
 Violence in Alagoas stated that the practice of executing young petty criminals is
 widely referred to in police circles as "social surgery." A 1997 Human Rights Watch
 report described the unjustified use of deadly force in police raids in urban shanty-
 towns; extrajudicial killings, justified in official reports as "resisting arrest;" and use
 of executions by off-duty officers to respond to minor provocations or to resolve per-
 sonal vendettas. The Government's failure to investigate, prosecute, and punish po-
 lice who commit such acts creates a sense of impunity that continues to encourage
 human rights abuses.
 All crimes less serious than murder committed by uniformed police officers
 against civilians remain in the military justice system. Of 2,359 cases against police
 officers that were sent to police tribunals in Sao Paulo state between January and
 October, 64 percent were retired without a court hearing. Cases were retired for in-
 sufficient evidence and lack of knowledge of the author of the crime. According to
 a study released in November by the Institute for Religious Studies (ISER), 98 per-
 cent of the 301 cases of police homicides the Institute examined from 1993 to 1996
 were determined to be "legitimate self-defense" and not brought to trial. ISER's
 medical researcher noted that in 245 cases there were signs of execution, including
 13 cases with gunshot wounds made at point blank range. In 64 percent of the cases
 examined, the victims were shot in the back.
 The number of citizens killed in conflicts with police in Sao Paulo rose 17 percent
 over 1997, according to the state government. According to the Sao Paulo police om-
 budsman, 60 percent of the victims had no prior police records, a fact that he be-
 lieves casts doubt on police claims that 80 percent of shooting victims were resisting
 arrest. Off-duty police officers committed 31 percent of police homicides during this
 period. This is the first year state police provided statistics on homicides committed
 by off-duty officers, a measure long called for by human rights organizations. Sao
 Paulo state's civil (investigative) police killed 45 persons during the first 9 months,
 a 309 percent increase over the same period in 1997. The Sao Paulo state Secretary
 for Public Security ordered investigations of all homicides committed by police in the
 line of duty in response to public questioning of police practices.
 Police homicides roughly doubled in Rio de Janeiro from 1997 to 1998, where po-
 lice killed 511 persons through October. According to another ISER study, Rio de
 Janeiro police officers rarely fired to immobilize rather than kill; half of the victims
 were killed with four or more bullets, and the majority of victims were shot in either
 the shoulders or the head. Forty cases clearly demonstrated execution-style deaths,
 where victims were first immobilized and then shot at close _range. Victims were
 often young, black, and without criminal records.
 The shooting of two suspected bank robbers by a police officer in Rio de Janeiro,
 recorded on video tape and broadcast in its entirety on the national evening news,
 graphically illustrated the commonplace use oflethal force by the police and the
 public's tolerant attitude toward such practices. On August 5, a uniformed police of-
 
 
 518
 
 ficer on duty in a busy public square in the Ipanema neighborhood of Rio de Janei-
 ro, alerted by a bystander, approached two men on a parked motorcycle who were
 suspected of ust having robbed a local bank. The uniformed policeman drew his gun
 and approached the two men. As he came close enough to question them, he also
 attempted to take a gun from one suspect who then attempted to draw the gun him-
 self. Without further warning, the policeman shot both suspects in the head at point
 blank range in succession and fired four more times as the suspects lay on the
 ground. The initial intense media coverage of the incident focused mostly on the
 ositive public response to the policeman's actions. His superiors decoratedhim for
 bravery. Some media and human rights observers questioned the appropriateness
 of the officer's action, his lack of training and preparation to deal with such an inci-
 dent, and his use of lethal force in a crowded public area.
 The state assembly of Rio de Janeiro in June suspended the controversial bravery
 awards for police that are linked by human rights observers to increased fatalities.
 The state assembly overturned Governor Marcelo Alencar's -veto and enacted a law
 that requests the executive to submit to the assembly legislation specifying criteria
 for the awards. The Governor appealed the assembly's action in the courts, arguing
 that the law is unconstitutional. -In September the state Minister of Public Security
 appealed to the assembly for reinstatement of the bravery awards, arguing that they
 were needed to maintain adequate salaries for the uniformed police. However, the
 Governor-elect of Rio de Janeiro state, who is to take office in January 1999, an-
 nounced that he would not seek to reinstate the bravery awards.
 Police involvement in criminal activities often produces killings. Throughout the
 country, off-duty police were implicated in killings for hire, kidnapings for ransom,
 and instances of "social cleansing," or the killings of persons considered undesirable
 such as criminals, street children, and homosexuals. For example, in September
 1997 off-duty Sao Paulo police officers were implicated in the kidnaping and murder
 of an 8-year-old boy. In 1996 in Belo Horizonte a group calling itself "Reacion" and
 reportedly composed of active duty and former police officers killed three street chil-
 dren. No new information was available on either investigation. Some incidents
 were widely publicized and drew attention to the need for better training and more
 pay for the police.
 The Inter-American Commission on. Human Rights (IACHR) stated in a December
 1997 report that the police forces require widespread reform to curb repeated in-
 stances of violence and other abuses. The report stated that the number of deaths
 in Rio de Janeiro attributed to state police officers averaged 20 a month in 1996,
 which it termed an "alarming phenomenon." It stated that one battalion covering
 slum areas was responsible for one third of the deaths. The IACHR also stated that
 the state police killed three times as many persons as those they injured in civilian
 confrontations, a reversal of normal patterns. The IACHR noted that "this is evi-
 dence of the use of excessive force and even shows a pattern of extrajudicial execu-
 tions by the Rio de Janeiro police."
 On the night of August 3, four uniformed policemen in the city of Salvador ab-
 ducted two transvestite prostitutes, took them to a nearby beach, and ordered them
 at gunpoint to enter the rough surf and, to swim as far as they could. One victim
 drowned. The other survived and later identified his four assailants, who subse-
 quently were arrested. The four policemen claimed they were acting under orders
 om superiors and implicated one of their commanding lieutenants. The lieutenant
 was not charged.
 On December 16, gunmen murdered Ceci Cunha, a federal deputy in the north-
 eastern state of Alagoas, her husband, her brother-in-law, and his mother. They
 were shot and killed shortly after an investiture ceremony for new Alagoas members
 of the federal Chamber of Deputies. The police arrested two suspects, one of them
 an employee of Cunha's elected alternate, who stands to inherit her seat in the
 Chamber. The investigation continued at year's end.
 Harsh prison conditions, official negligence, poor sanitary conditions, lack of medi-
 cal care, and dangerous conditions led to a number of deaths in prisons (see Section
 1.c.).
 In December 1997, unknown assailants shot and killed four street residents who
 were sleeping outdoors in the Madurerira neighborhood in Rio de Janeiro. No sus-
 pects have been arrested, and there was no information available as to progress in
 an investigation, if any, of the killings.
 A 1996 law giving civil courts jurisdiction over intentional homicide committed by
 uniformed police officers was used in some high-profile cases. In the first such case,
 a civilian court in Sao Paulo convicted Otavio Gamba, the leader of a uniformed po-
 lice squad caught torturing and murdering civilians on video in a roadblock in the
 Sao Paulo neighborhood of Diadema in March 1997 and sentenced him to 65 years'
 imprisonment. Although Gambra received sentences totaling 65 years in jail for fa-
 
 
 519
 
 tally shooting Mario Josino, as well as attempted homicide and abuse of authority,
 he will serve the maximum sentence permitted under the law, which is 30 years.
 Civil courts also gave three other officers sentences ranging from 4 to 26 years; four
 other officers involved in the widely publicized roadblock incident awaited trial at
 year's end. Police tribunals in August already had sentenced the eight policemen to
 jail terms ranging from 18 months to 4 years for their involvement in the case.
 These sentences largely conform to the maximum permitted by the tribunals, but
 all but one of the defendants is to serve the police tribunal's sentence under house
 arrest. The Sao Paulo uniformed police expelled two other officers for their involve-
 ment in the incident, but have not punished the officers responsible for supervising
 the group. The commander of the police battalion in the neighborhood, after initially
 being relieved of duty, was reinstated and suffered only administrative punishment.
 In most less prominent cases, the decision whether a policeman acted in self-de-
 fense or committed an intentional homicide is based on an investigation performed
 by the police force itself; almost without exception, the police investigators conclude
 that suspects were "resisting arrest."
 Federal authorities in the state of Mato Grosso do Sl are investigating 5 uni-
 formed policemen regarding 11 death-squad style killings committed in 1997. A
 state legislator monitoring the investigation believes that these policemen commit-
 ted at least 40 such homicides. In a separate incident, the authorities charged one
 of the five with killing for hire.
 Human rights monitors visiting the morgue in Maceio, Alagoas state, found that
 the bodies of 12 persons, who aegedly were the victims of a death squad that in-
 cluded members of the police, were missing. The authorities had been investigating
 the group, known as the Uniformed Gang, because most of its members reportedly
 were police officers. They arrested more than 60 police officers, and the courts sen-
 tenced 3 of them to 6-year prison terms for illegal possession of machine guns.
 The president of the state Supreme Court of Acre, with the assistance of federal
 authorities, reopened 110 murder and torture cases previously suspended by state
 authorities for lack of evidence. He claimed that at least 30 of the cases involve
 death squads with police participation. His investigation led to charges against one
 uniformed policeman and a civlian, who are being held in the Federal District be-
 cause of threats made against them.
 Five policemen charged in December 1997 with the February 1997 murder of
 Osvaldo Manoel da Silva await trail. The policemen ciaimed that da Silva died as
 a result of wounds suffered while resisting arrest, but a reconstruction of the events
 by a credible university forensic team indicated that he was shot three times while
 in the ambulance on the way to the hospital.
 Sao Paulo civil authorities continue to investigate five Sao Paulo policemen in
 connection with the May 1997 killing of three homeless persons during a riot that
 erupted at a low-income housing project in geater Sao Paulo. The poice were carry-
 ing out a court order to remove over 400 19ilies that had occupied the  fazenda
 da Juta" housing complex illegally on May 3. The police operation was broadcast
 on television and criticized as an excessive use of force. The authorities have not
 yet indicted the officers under investigation.
 The authorities continue to investigate the May 1996 death-squad killings in the
 Franco da Rocha neighborhood of Sao Paulo. Witnesses identified five uniformed po-
 lice officers as having arrested four men who were found dead a few hours later.
 Franco da Rocha is one of Sao Paulo state's poorest communities and the location
 of a clandestine dumping site for the victims of death squads. Since 1993 at least
 212 bodies have been found there, including 50 victims killed by bullets to the head.
 The arms and heads of some of the bodies were removed in an apparent attempt
 to conceal the victims' identities.
 A Rio de Janeiro court sentenced Marco Aurelio Dias, the final defendant in the
 case of the massacre of eight street children near the Candelaria church in down-
 town Rio de Janeiro in 1993, t 204 years in prison (18 years for each homicide and
 12 years for each attempted homicide). The penultimate defendant, Marcos Vinicius
 Manuel, had been sentenced to 89 years in prison in late 1997.
 In November a jury acqultted 10 officers accused of participating in the 1993 kill-
 ing of 21 residents of the Vigario Geral neighborhood of Rio de Janeiro. Human
 rights groups had monitored the case closely and strongly criticized the verdict. The
 Public Ministry planned to contest the decision. Two of the original 33 defendants
 have died, 2 are in prison, and no trial date has been set for another group of 19
 police officers in the case.
 State authorities in Pato have asked for a change in venue from the city of
 Maraba to the state capital of Belem in the case of 153 police officers charged in
 1997 with intentional murder in the November 1996 massacre of 19 landless work-
 er in Eldorado de Carajas. State prosecutors charge that the majority of jury mem-
 
 
 520
 bers selected in Maraba are prejudiced because of their ties to land-owning inter-
 ests. Federal government agents are protecting journalist Mariza Romao, who re-
 ceived a series of death threats after testifying against the police officers charged
 in the case.
 In 1997 state authorities charged the commander and 19 other police officers in-
 volved in the August 1995 massacre of 9 squatters in Corumbiara, Rondonia, with
 intentional homicide, which meant that those accused are to be tried in regular
 courts rather than by a special police tribunal. They also charged four squatter lead-
 ers with intentional homicide for the deaths of two policemen, as well as for the
 deaths of the nine squatters. The authorities justified the latter charges by declar-
 ing that the leaders were responsible for the land invasion that sparked the con-
 frontation. The medical examiner reported that most of the squatters killed had
 been shot in the back at short range and that many of the bullets had traveled from
 the top of the body downward, indicating that the victims had been killed from be-
 hind while kneeling. At year's end, a Rondonia state court was reviewing the ap-
 peals filed after the local judge decided which cases would go to a Jury.
 Retired military police Colonel Ubiratan Guimaraes appealed a judge's September
 decision to try him in civil court for his role in the deaths of 111 inmates during
 the October 1992 Carandiru prison riot in Sao Paulo. If tried, Guimaraes would be
 the first policeman of the rank of colonel to face a civilian jury under the 1996 law.
 In October Guimaraes lost his reelection to the Sao Paulo state assembly, which
 previously had provided him with parliamentary immunity and shielded him from
 9 rosecution. Civilian prosecutors continue to investigate charges against 121 other
 ao Paulo police officers accused of crimes ranging from homicide to use of excessive
 force while quelling the riot. In March civil prosecutors filed charges against 85 of
 those police officers, including 43 senior officers. As of year's end, no trial date had
 been set. Human rights activists have brought the case before the IACHR as an ex-
 ample of impunity in human rights cases.
 here were no developments in the 1997 killing of radio show host Edgar Lopes
 de Faria (see Section 2.a.)..
 The rural Landless Workers' Movement (MST) continued its campaign of illegally
 occupying land identified as unproductive, blocking highways, and occupying gov-
 ernment buildings, leading to continued confrontations with landowners, their gun-
 men, and policemen. MST activists destroyed private property during some occupa-
 tions. A group of MST activists kidnaped three employees of the federal land reform
 agency in the state of Para in September and held them for over 36 hours until the
 government agreed to provide the group with food staples.
 In April an employee of a local landowner reportedly shot and killed MST leader
 Sadi Padillo in Abelardo Luz, Santa Catarina. The local Labor Party president
 charged that an armed militia paid by local landowners had targeted MST leaders
 for murder. Padilla had led a group of 300 families who occupied a local holding
 but who had left peacefully after reaching an agreement with the Governments
 land reform agency. The Pastoral Land Commission (CPT) reported that 26 landless
 activists were murdered- through November. In December Sao Paulo state police re-
 ported finding the bodies of two MST members with bullet wounds in their heads
 and signs of torture. They had been leaders of a group of 180 peasant families who
 occupied land in September near Sao Jose dos Campos in northeastern Sao Paulo
 state. Such killings usually go unpunished, because the landowners thought to be
 responsible for many of them reportedly control the police in isolated areas and in-
 tinidate local judges and lawyers with violence and threats of violence.
 In March an appellate court upheld the August 1997 court decision to prosecute
 four suspects accused of killing Pataxo Indian leader Galdino Jesus dos Santos for
 manslaughter rather than murder. The authorities appealed this ruling and still
 seek to prosecute them on homicide charges. Dos Santos died in April 1997 after
 five youths set him on fire while he was asleep on a small bench.
 In August a federal appeals court upheld the decision of the state Supreme Court
 of Espirito Santo to move the retrial of MST leader Jose Rainha to the state capital
 of Vitoria. Rainha's attorneys convinced the state court that he faced a biased jury
 in Pedro Canario. No trial date had been set by year's end. A jury in the small,
 rural town of Pedro Canario, Espirito Santo, sentenced Rainha to 26  years for the
 1989 murders of landowner Jose Machado Neto and police officer Sergio Narciso da
 Silva. The jury convicted Rainha even though the prosecution presented no material
 evidence and witnesses testified to Rainha's presence 1,500 miles away from the
 scene of the crime. Since Rainha's sentence exceeded 20 years, he was automatically
 entitled to a retrial.
 In December a Sao Paulo jury found former Sao Paulo precinct chief Carlos
 Vasconcelos innocent in a retrial for his participation in the deaths of 18 inmates
 in 1989 in a jail administered by the civil police's 42nd Delegation. A jury previously
 
 
 521
 
 had acquitted Vasconcelos on the same chargers in 1996, but state prosecutors ap-
 pealed the decision. A 1997 court decision sentenced police investigator Celso Jose
 da Cruz to a 516-year jail term for involvement in the same killing;, Cruz appealed
 the verdict and awaited a retrial at year's end. Twenty-nine other policemen
 charged as codefendants in the case still were awaiting trial.
 According to human rights activists monitoring the case, proceedings have stalled
 against the former mayor of Rio Maria, in the state of Para, who was charged with
 the 1985 murder of Joao Canut, the first president of the rural workers union in
 Rio Maria. Canuto's daughter, Luzia Canuto, received death threats as a result of
 the case. In June the IACHR criticized the Government for failing to prosecute the
 crime.
 In coordination with the National Secretariat of Human Rights or on their own,
 several states, including Sao Paulo, Rio Grande do Sul, Minas Gerais, Espirito
 Santo, Ceara, Sergipe, and Bahia have implemented some form of human rights
 awareness training for the uniformed police. In many cases, including that of Bahia,
 the police authorities invited local nongovernmental organizations (NGO's) to con-
 duct or assist in the training. The secretariat expanded an ongoing human rights
 training program for policemen coordinated with Amnesty International to 10
 states.
 The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) in October completed its
 first course of human rights training for high-ranking military police officers from
 21 states at the federal police academy in Brasilia. The program is scheduled to run
 for 2 years and train over 300 police officers. The course is designed to have these
 officers pass the training on to junior ranking officers and police recruits at the
 state level. The ICRC is implementing the program under the auspices of the Jus-
 tice Ministry's police coordination secretariat.
 In December 1997, the military police in Sao Paulo initiated a community-policing
 program that is expected to take 10 years to implement fully. The police formed a
 committee composed of over 20 human rights groups, judges, and community lead-
 ers to assist and assess the project. They also instituted a policy of "recycling" po-
 licemen involved in shootings, removing them from patrols for 6 months and offering
 them counseling. As of November, one-fifth of the Sao Paulo state military police
 force (16,000 of 80,000 policemen) have received training under the program, and
 4,300 policemen participate in community policing patrols. Additionally, the police
 have increased the acquisition of and training in the use of nonlethal arms such as
 tear gas, rubber bullets, and electric stun devices. Human rights groups maintain
 that the effect of these programs has been limited, at best However, human rights
 activists in many states reported increased willingness of police authorities to ad-
 dress their concerns and to deal with problems brought to their attention.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 However, off-duty police reportedly were involved in several abductions for ran-
 som. In 1997 the human rights division of the public prosecutor's office in Belo
 Horizonte reported that, in the previous 7 years, it had received nearly 100 com-
 plaints of "disappearances" of persons from Belo Horizonte in which the police alleg-
 edly were involved. In the majority of cases, the alleged victims were criminal sus-
 pects.
 In 1995 Congress passed legislation recognizing and assuming government re-
 sponsibility for the deaths of political activists who "disappeared" during the mili-
 tary regime while in the custody of public officials and obligating the Government
 to pay indemnities of between $100,000 and $150,000 to each of the families. In Sep-
 tember 1997, President Cardoso signed a decree awarding reparations to the fami-
 lies of 43 such persons. A commission created by the law continued to evaluate re-
 quests for, and authorize payment of, indemnities.
 MST activists kidnaped three government employees for 36 hours in September
 (see Section l.a.).
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution and a 1997 law prohibit torture and provide for severe legal pen-
 alties for its use. However, there are frequent credible reports that police torture
 and beat criminal suspects to extract information, confessions, or money. In a highly
 publicized case in May, police in Rio de Janeiro tortured Deilson Santana, a suspect
 in the brutal killing of an 18-year-old student in an affluent Rio de Janeiro neigh-
 borhood. After a separate investigation into the murder cleared Santana of any re-
 sponsibility, the officers responsible for the torture unsuccessfully tried to implicate
 him in an unrelated crime in an effort to discredit him.
 The Government estimated in its 1994 report on the internal human rights situa-
 tion that fewer than 10 percent of cases of mistreatment by police are reported. Vic-
 tims generally are poor, uneducated about their rights, and afraid to come forward
 for fear of reprisals. Human rights activists claim that beatings in Sao Paulo prisons
 
 
 led to the deaths of Carlos Alberto Moura in February and Otovio dos Santos Filho
 in October 1997.
 The Sao Paulo state police ombudsman received 696 complaints through Septem-
 ber alleging torture, abuse, or mistreatment. These represented 24 percent of all
 complaints received, compared with 11 percent of all complaints received in 1997.
 The ombudsman's office attributed this rise to a growing public awareness of its
 work and willingness to report cases of abuse. Nonetheless, the ombudsman's office
 believes that the number of cases reported represents only a fraction of those that
 take place. In June the civil police in Sao Paulo opened an inquiry into the system-
 atic torture of prisoners occurring in January and February. Of the 350 prisoners
 held in a detention facility during this period, 107 showed evidence of a similar pat-
 tern of beating that included broken fingers, arms, legs, and jaws, according to state
 medical authorities. The civil police dismissed four officers as a result of the inves-
 tigation. In another case, prison authorities dismissed a prison guard who report-
 edly beat prisoners with a baseball bat.
 In testimony before the federal Chamber of Deputies' human rights committee in
 April, a member of the National Conference of Catholic Bishops prison pastoral com-
 mission criticized the abusive practices of two special units of the Sao Paulo civil
 police, the Special Operations Group and the armed unit for the prevention of rob-
 beries and assaults. Local chapters of the Center for Human Rights in the state of
 Tocantins submitted evidence of over 30 cases of torture committed by the police in
 the state to the federal Chamber of Deputies' human rights committee in December.
 State prosecutors removed the director of the state's provisional prison from her
 post and indicted her after two inmates were tortured in February.
 On June 15, the Federal District civil police dismissed police officer Jorge Tadeu
 dos Santos and charged him with torture for beating a prisoner who had been de-
 tained for a traffic violation. This was the first case brought under the 1997 torture
 legislation in the Federal District.
 The state of Santa Catarina created a panel to award citizens imprisoned or tor-
 tured for political motives between 1961 and 1979 compensation in amounts ranging
 from the equivalent of $4,400 to $26,500.
 Prison conditions range from poor to harsh. Severe overcrowding is prevalent, es-
 pecially in larger cities. According to Ministry of Justice figures for 1997, prisons
 nationwide held 101,482 prisoners although the total designed inmate capacity was
 74,592. In the states with the largest prison populations, including Sao Paulo, Rio
 de Janeiro, Bahia, Rio Grande do Sl, and Pernambuco, overcrowding is signifi-
 cantly worse. In the state of Sao Paulo, which holds 40 percent of the national pris-
 on population, 52 percent of inmates were serving their sentences in police stations
 or local jails, according to state statistics from 1997. Most penal authorities do not
 have the resources to separate minor offenders from adults and petty offenders from
 violent criminals. Sao Paulo's prison system, in particular, suffers from chronic over-
 crowding, corrupt and abusive local prison management, and prisoner access to
 weapons and drugs.
 In February prisoner Elcio Oliveira Lima died of heat prostration in an over-
 crowded local jail in the Santa Cruz neighborhood of Rio de Janeiro. A police officer
 on duty told the press that the temperature in the jail cells routinely reached 115
 degrees. Another officer stated that there was a constant shortage of water in the
 jail. Lima was detained with 13 other prisoners in a 4.5-foot by 9.5-foot cell with
 an official capacity of 7 persons.
 Prison riots were frequent occurrences. Sao Paulo state officials reported a 147
 percent increase in prison revolts from 1996 to 1997 (from 72 to 178 incidents). On
 Dcember 28, 1997, inmates took over the prison in Sorocaba, Sao Paulo state, in
 an effort to cover up an escape attempt. They took visitors and prison officials hos-
 tage; one inmate and a visitor were killed. After 3 days of negotiations, 400 special
 police stormed the prison and freed the hostages. The authorities subsequently
 transferred 20 inmates to other prisons. In the first 7 months of 1998, 103 prison
 riots occurred in Sao Paulo state. On November 27, prisoners in the police station
 holding facility in Sao Paulo's Diadema neighborhood took a guard prisoner, de-
 manding to be transferred from the overcrowded facility. They proceeded to kill
 three prisoners, two in front of television cameras. The authorities agreed to trans-
 fer 23 inmates, and the prisoners released the guard. On the same day, 5 armed
 men freed 109 detainees from a police station in Campinas; the facility was de-
 signed to hold 40 persons but held 179 at the time. Discipline is difficult to maintain
 under such conditions, and prison officials often resort to inhuman treatment to
 maintain order. According to the Catholic Church's prison ministry, guards beat all
 24 prisoners in the "dungeon" section of Sao Paulo's notorious Carandiru prison on
 January 24 after discovering one knife. Similar beatings occurred on March 24 at
 Sao Paulo's 42nd precinct after guards discovered an escape tunnel.

 Prisons do not provide adequate protection against violence inflicted by inmates
 on each other. On November 27, inmates burned two prisoners to death in a jail
 in Orlandia. In the Barreto Campelo maximum-security penitentiary in the state of
 Pernambuco, 22 prisoners died in a period of 1 week in violence attributed to battles
 between drug gangs in which .prison guards also were involved, according to press
 accounts. The prison held roughly twice as many prisoners as its designed capacity.
 Prisoners are subject to extremely poor health conditions as well. Scabies and tuber-
 culosis, diseases not common in the general population, are widespread in Sao Paulo
 prisons. The Ministry of Justice estimates that 10 to 20 percent of the national pris-
 on population is HIV positive. Denial of first aid and other medical care is some-
 times used as a form of punishment.
 In November President Cardoso approved a law authorizing alternative sentenc-
 ing, aimed in part at easing prison overcrowding. A Ministry of Justice plan to con-
 struct 52 new prisons and renovate and enlarge existing prisons was elayed and
 construction contracts had not been awarded by year's end. The program is designed
 to add capacity to the prison system for 24,465 inmates, according to the Ministry.
 Twelve of the new prisons are to be constructed in Sao Paulo. Sao Paulo prison au-
 thorities transferred 3,773 inmates from the most overcrowded urban jails to prisons
 in the interior of the state, but the authorities did not meet their goal of transfer-
 ring 12,000 prisoners during the year.
 In December Human Rights Watch issued a comprehensive report on prisons enti-
 tled '"ehind Bars in Brazil." The report is based on an intensive review of prison
 conditions in 8 of the 27 states and meticulously documents inhuman conditions and
 a range of human rights abuses throughout the prison system.
 Although it is government policy to permit prison visits by independent human
 rights monitors, state authorities frequently denied such access. The Human Rights
 Watch report noted that gaining access to prisons was surprisingly difficult," and
 that barriers ranged from outright denial of access to the use of procedural delays.
 Only three states of the eight investigated-Amazonas, the Federal District, and Rio
 Grande do Norte-made their prisons completely accessible. The authorities in Rio
 de Janeiro state completely denied access. The authorities in Paraiba state denied
 Human Rights Watch investigators unmonitored access to the inmates at the Roger
 penitentiary in December 1997, despite a judicial order allowing for the possibility,
 only months after the deaths of 11 prisoners within the facility. Also in December
 1997, the governor of Ceara issued a decree barring members of the Catholic
 Church's prison ministry from entering prisons in that state, citing the mission's
 presence as a factor causing a prison riot in Fortaleza earlier that month. The
 Church's prison ministry strongly denied the charge.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The law prohibits arbitrary arrest and
 detention, and the Government generally observes this prohibition; however, police
 continued at times to detain persons arbitrarily. The Constitution limits arrests to
 those caught in the act of committing a crime or those arrested by order of a judicial
 authority. The authorities usually respect the constitutional provision for a judicial
 determination of the legality of detention, although some convicted inmates are held
 beyond their sentences due to poor record keeping. The law permits provisional de-
 tention for up to 5 days under specified conditions during a police investigation, but
 a judge may extend this period. However, groups that work with street children
 claim that the police sometimes detain street youths illegally without a judicial
 order or hold them incommunicado.
 The Government does not use forced exile.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The judiciary is an independent branch of govern-
 ment, but it is inefficient and subject to political and economic influence. In many
 instances, lower-income, less-educated citizens make limited use of the appeals proc-
 ess that otherwise might ensure the right to fair trial.
 The judicial system, with the federal Supreme Court at its apex, includes courts
 of first instance and appeals courts. States organize their own judicial systems but
 must adhere to the basic principles in the Constitution. There is also a system of
 specialized courts that deal with police, labor, elections, juveniles, and family mat-
 ters.
 Special police courts have jurisdiction over state uniformed police (except when
 charged with intentional homicide); the record of these courts shows that conviction
 is the exception rather than the rule. A human rights group in the northeast that
 studied alleged police crimes against civilians tried in police courts from 1970 to
 1991 found that only 8 percent of the cases resulted in convictions. In Sao Paulo,
 another study found that only 5 percent of cases resulted in convictions. A study
 of police homicides in Rio de Janeiro state in 1993-96 found no instance of a convic-
 tion in 301 cases (see Section l.a.). These courts (which are separate from the
 courts-martial of the armed forces, except for the final appeals court) are composed
 
 
 524
 of four ranking state uniformed police officials and one civilian judge. With too few
 judges for the caseload, there are backlogs, and human rights groups note a lack
 of zeal among police charged with investigating fellow officers.
 In 1996 the President signed legislation giving ordinary courts jurisdiction over
 cases in which uniformed police officers are accused of intentional homicide against
 civilians. However, the internal police investigation determines if the homicide was
 intentional, and the police tribunal decides whether to forward a case to a civil court
 for trial. As a result, cases almost never come to trial. The first known case was
 the Gamba conviction in Sao Paulo (see Section L.a.).
 In a speech before the Order of Brazilian Attorneys in July, President Cardoso
 criticized the slowness and poor administration of the justice system and said that
 reform was imperative. The President noted that the Supreme Court had ruled on
 over 40,000 cases in 1997 and, citing a figure provided by the Institute of Economic,
 Social, and Political Studies of Sao Paulo, said that 90 percent of cases ruled on by
 appellate courts were redundant. The president of the federal Supreme Court com-
 plained in a 1997 press interview about the volume of appeals that by law the Su-
 preme Court must review. It takes 8 years to reach a definitive decision in the aver-
 age case, a delay the Supreme Court president considered unjust. At the appellate
 court level, a large backlog of cases hinders the courts' ability to ensure fair and
 expeditious trials.
 Defendants are entitled to counsel and must be made fully aware of the charges
 against them. According to the Ministry of Justice, approximately 85 percent of pris-
 oners cannot afford an attorney. In such cases, the court must provide one at public
 expense; courts are supposed to appoint private attorneys to represent poor defend-
 ants when public defenders are unavailable, but often no effective defense is pro-
 vided. Juries decide only cases of willful crimes against life, including crimes by po-
 lice; judges try all others.
 The right to a fair public trial as provided by law generally is respected in prac-
 tice, although in ruralareas the judiciary generally is less capable and more subject
 to the influence of local landowners, particularly in cases related to indigenous peo-
 ple and rural union activists. Similarly, local police are often less zealous in inves-
 tigating, prosecutors are reluctant to initiate proceedings, and judges find reasons
 to delay when cases involve gunmen contracted by landowners to eliminate squat-
 ters or rural union activists.
 Low pay, combined with exacting competitive examinations that in some years
 eliminate 90 percent of the applicants, make it difficult to fill vacancies on the
 bench. The system requires that a trial be held within a set period of time from
 the date of the crime. Due to the backlog, old cases frequently are dismissed. Ac-
 cording to a former judge, this encourages corrupt judges to delay certain cases pur-
 posely, so that they can be dismissed. Lawyers often drag out cases as long as pos-
 sible in the hope that an appeals court might render a favorable opinion and be-
 cause they are paid according to the amount of time that they spend on a case.
 The president of the state Supreme Court in Acre reported that state police told
 him explicitly that they would not investigate police involvement in death squads
 for fear of reprisal when he attempted to reopen cases suspended for lack of evi-
 dence (see Section L.a.).
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution provides for freedom from arbitrary intrusion into the home, although
 wiretaps authorized by judicial authority are permitted. The law regulating the con-
 ditions under which wiretaps may be used appears to strike a fair balance between
 giving the police an effective law enforcement tool and protecting the civil liberties
 of citizens. There were no reports of illegal entry for political reasons, but illegal
 entry into homes without a warrant occurs in searches for criminal suspects. The
 inviolability of private correspondence is respected.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution prohibits all forms of censor-
 ship and provides for freedom of speech and a free press, and the authorities respect
 these rights in practice.
 Newspapers and magazines, which are privately owned, vigorously report and
 comment on government performance. Both the press and broadcast media routinely
 discuss controversial social and political issues and engage in investigative report-
 ing. Most radio and television stations are privately owned; however, the Govern-
 ment has licensing authority, and politicians frequently obtain the licenses. Current
 or former congressmen, some of whom are or were members of the committee that
 oversees communications, own many television and radio stations. It is difficult to
 determine how many media outlets are indirectly controlled by politicians since con-
 
 
 525
 cessions are often registered in the names of family members or friends linked to
 them. In addition, the Government regularly approves transfers of concessions al-
 ready granted to other individuals with little oversight.
 The penalty for libel under the 1967 press law-a prison term-is considered ex-
 treme by judges and rarely is imposed. Press criticism has described it as an archaic
 and authoritarian law inherited from the military regime. In a report issued in Oc-
 tober, the National Association of Journalists (ANJ), which represents 115 separate
 press organizations, claimed that the threat of prohibitive fines and jail sentences
 discouraged freedom of the press. The ANJ cited two judgments made during the
 year against publishers that amounted to hundreds of thousands of dollars and in-
 cluded jail terms of several months.
 Complex electoral campaign laws regulate the broadcast media and prescribe com-
 plicated arrangements to apportion the free use of commercial radio and television
 time granted to political parties during an election campaign. The short periods for
 rulings and nonappeal provisions of the regulations are designed to enforce dis-
 cipline and to ensure that remedies, are applied in a timely matter. A Sao Paulo
 electoral court levied stiff sanctions on two television stations for violations during
 the election campaign, in one case for comments made by a sensationalist talk show
 host that were deemed to favor one candidate. Although the rulings provoked con-
 troversy, in general media and free speech advocates accept the manner in which
 the campaign laws are enforced.
 Foreign publications are widely distributed; prior review of films, plays, and radio
 and television programming is practiced only to determine a suitable viewing age.
 The October ANJ report documented a number of violent threats and physical at-
 tacks, including killings, against the press since 1995. These include 12 murders of
 journalists in retaliation for investigative reporting on organized crime, police cor-
 ruption, government fraud, and human rights abuses. In October 1997, unknown as-
 sailants killed Edgar Lopes de Faria, the host of a radio show in the state capital
 of Mato Grosso do Sul, who had announced that he would disclose the names of the
 region's organized crime leaders. No arrests have been made in any of these cases.
 In addition to killings, the ANJ report cites numerous cases of intimidation and
 death threats made against journalists during the same period.
 Academic freedom is respected.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 the right to assemble peacefully, and the Government respects this right in practice.
 Permits are not required for outdoor political or labor meetings, and such meetings
 occur frequently.
 The Constitution provides for the right of freedom of association, and the Govern-
 ment respects this right in practice.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the
 Government respects this right in practice. There is no favored or state religion. All
 faiths are free to establish places of worship, train clergy, and proselytize, although
 the Government controls entry into Indian lands.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-There are no restrictions on movement, except entry into protected In-
 dian areas, nor are there any restrictions on emigration or return. However, a par-
 ent is not allowed to leave the country with children without the permission of the
 other parent.
 In July 1997, the Government passed legislation with provisions for asylum and
 refugee status intended to conform with the principles of the 1951 United Nations
 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees and its 1967 Protocol. The Govern-
 ment provides first asylum and cooperates with the office of the U.N. High Commis-
 sioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and other humanitarian organizations in assisting ref-
 ugees. There were 800 requests for refugee status during the year, 480 cases were
 granted and 320 cases were denied. According to the UNHCR, there were 2,350 ref-
 ugees in the country at year's end.
 There were no reports of the forced return of persons to a country where they
 feared persecution.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The Constitution provides citizens with the right to change their government
 peacefully, and citizens exercise this right in practice through periodic, free, and fair
 elections held on the basis of universal suffrage. Voting is secret and mandatory for
 all literate citizens age 18 to 70, except for military conscripts who may not vote.
 It is voluntary for minors age 16 to 18, for the illiterate, and for those age 70 and
 over.
 
 
 Women have full political rights under the Constitution and are increasingly ac-
 tive in politics and government. However, cultural, institutional, and financial bar-
 riers continue to limit women's participation in political life. The number of female
 candidates for office in the national elections roughly doubled from the number in
 1994, according to statistics released by the Supreme Electoral Court. Women con-
 stituted 12.3 percent of the total candidates. However, their representation in the
 national Congress decreased from 7.6 percent to 5.7 percent after the elections; 29
 women were elected to the 513-seat Chamber of Deputies, and 5 to the 81-seat Sen-
 ate. There were 2 women in the 29-member Cabinet.
 Brazil's diverse ethnic and racial groups, while free to participate politically, are
 not represented in government and politics in proportion to their numbers in the
 general population.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 A number of local and national human rights groups operate without government
 restriction, investigating and publishing their findings on human rights cases. Fed-
 eral officials generally are cooperative and responsive to their views.
 Established in April 1997, the Justice Ministry's National Secretariat of Human
 Rights oversees implementation of a 1996 action plan to address human rights
 abuses. The secretariat administered or sponsored programs to reduce violence
 among the poor, to train police officials in human rights practices, and to combat
 discrimination against blacks, women, children, indigenous people, the elderly, and
 the handicapped. In December the National Human Rights Secretary, Dr. Jose
 Gregori, received the United Nations Human Rights Prize for his role in implement-
 ing the plan and his accomplishments on behalf of human rights, dating back to his
 cooperation with groups trying to restore democracy during the period of military
 The IACHR's December 1997 report noted President Cardoso's "objective treat-
 ment' of human rights problems and the positive thrust of the national human
 rights action plan, adopted in 1996. The report also strongly criticized Brazil for vio-
 lating a broad range of human rights, including police violence and involvement in
 extrajudicial killing, violence against and exploitation of minors, and general impu-
 nity for human rights violators. President Cardoso publicly accepted the findings of
 serious human rights abuses in the IACHR report, acknowledging in a speech that
 the nation could not, "as in the past, pretend these things do not exist." In 1998
 Dr. Gregori and other government officials cooperated with IACHR inquiries into
 several specific cases.
 In December the Senate ratified legislation accepting the binding jurisdiction of
 the Inter-American Court of Human Rights. When the Government deposited its ac-
 ceptance, it stated that the action applies on a nonretroactive basis.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 Discrimination on the basis of sex, race, religion, or nationality is against the law,
 yet women, blacks, and indigenous people continued to experience discrimination.
 The International Labor Organization (ILO) notes that important differences in
 wages exist to the detriment of women and blacks, particularly in rural areas. The
 Government passed a law in May 1997 that provides prison penalties and fines for
 racist acts, including promulgation of pejorative terms for ethnic or racial groups,
 use of the swastika, or acts of discrimination based on sex, religion, age, or ethnic
 There continued to be reports of violence against homosexuals, although it was
 not always clear that the victims' sexual orientation was the reason. The Gay Group
 of Bahia (GGB), Brazil's best known homosexual rights organization, other human
 rights organizations, and Amnesty International have in the past 5 years docu-
 mented the existence of skinhead, neo-Nazi, and "machista" gangs that attacked
 suspected homosexuals in cities including Rio de Janeiro, Salvador, Belo Horizonte,
 and Brasilia. In some cases these gangs included police officers.
 The GGB maintains that increasing numbers of homosexuals are being killed be-
 cause of their sexual orientation in Salvador, citing as an example the murder on
 August 28 of Roberto Jorge Franco, a well-known proprietor of a gay nightclub in
 Salvador with close ties to the GGB. Information from the GGB and other homo-
 sexual rights groups clearly indicates that transvestite prostitutes, the most visible
 homosexual group, are at a greater risk of violence than other homosexuals. Police
 routinely extort money from transvestites and often beat or kill those who fail to
 cooperate. A board member of the Permanent Forum against Violence in Alagoas,
 Pedro Montenegro, and the president of the Gay Group of Alagoas, Marcelo
 
 
 527
 Nasciemento, received death threats after denouncing the involvement of the civil
 police in a series of murders of transvestites in the city of Maceio in 1997. In August
 in the city of Salvador, four military policemen beat and then forced two transves-
 tite prostitutes to enter the ocean in a particularly dangerous area. One of the vic-
 tins drowned (see Section l.a.).
 Women.-There is a high incidence of physical abuse of women. Most major cities
 and towns have established special police offices to deal with crimes of domestic or
 sexual violence against women; such offices total over 200. Rapes reported to the
 police in the state of Rio de Janeiro increased 34 percent in the period between 1994
 and 1997, according to the state Ministry for Public Security. Both state authorities
 and women's rights activists agree that a large number of rapes go unreported. The
 Sao Paulo Center for Assistance to Female Victims of Sexual Violence reported that
 400 women sought the center's intervention in rape cases after receiving no help
 from the police.
 In rural areas, abused women have little recourse since there are no specialized
 police offices available to them. Men who commit crimes against women, including
 sexual assault and murder, are unlikely to be brought to trial. Although the Su-
 preme Court in 1991 struck down the archaic concept of "defense of honor" as a jus-
 tification for murder of a wife, courts are still reluctant to prosecute and convict
 men who claim that they attacked their wives for infidelity. In June the National
 Movement for Human Rights reported that female murder victims were 30 times
 more likely to be killed by current or former husbands or lovers than by others.
 The federal police in Rio de Janeiro state created a specialized unit to deal with
 crimes of trafficking in women and children. The unit reported 15 active investiga-
 tions into trafficking; 12 for trafficking to Spain, 2 to Israel and 1 to Japan. In the
 past, they also have handled cases involving traffic to Italy and Portugal.
 The Constitution prohibits discrimination based on sex in employment or pay and
 provides for 120 days of paid maternity leave. However, the provision against wage
 discrimination rarely is enforced. According to official statistics released in August,
 women with a high school education or less earn, on average, 63 percent of the sala-
 ries earned by men with the same level of education. Black women earn on average
 26 percent of a white male's salary. A recent study by a sociologist showed that
 women who started working in positions in which they earned twice the minimum
 wage advanced in pay after 10 years to a wage of seven times the minimum wage.
 Men starting in the same positions earned 2.6 times the minimum wage and ad-
 vanced to a wage of 10.9 times the minimum wage after 10 years. A Ministry of
 Labor survey reported that the average starting salary for high school educated
 women in Sao Paulo was one-third less than the average starting salary for high
 school educated men.
 In response to the maternity leave law, some employers seek sterilization certifi-
 cates from female job applicants or try to avoid hiring women of childbearing age.
 In an effort to end such practices, President Cardoso signed a law in 1995 that pro-
 hibited employers from requiring applicants or employees to take pregnancy tests
 or present sterilization certificates. Employers who violate the law are subject to a
 jail term ranging from 1 to 2 years, while the company must pay a fine equal to
 10 times the salary of its highest paid employee.
 Children.-Despite progressive laws to protect children and a growing awareness
 of their plight through media and NGO campaigns, millions of children continue to
 suffer from the poverty afflicting their families, must work to survive, and fail to
 get an education. A report issued by the Brazilian Institute for Geography and Sta-
 tistics (IBGE) stated that the number of children between the ages of 10 and 14
 who were employed decreased by 163,000 from 1993 to 1995. However, more than
 3.8 million children in the same age range continue to work, many of them together
 with their parents, under conditions approximating forced labor or debt bondage
 (see Sections 6.c. and 6.d.). Many other children beg on the streets of cities. School-
 ing is free and compulsory for the first six grades and is available in all parts of
 the country. The education system does not exclude any groups.
 There are no reliable figures on the number of street children, some of whom are
 homeless, but the majority of whom return home at night. Disparities in the num-
 bers of children living in the street reported by children's rights activists indicate
 the difficulty of arriving at accurate estimates. In Rio de Janeiro, an organization
 aiding street children estimated recently that 30,000 frequent the streets by day but
 probably less than 1,000 sleep there. In Sao Paulo, NGO's aiding street children es-
 timated that some 12,000 children roam the streets by day'and that from 3,000 to
 5,000 of them live permanently on the streets. In Salvador, Bahia, NGO's estimate
 the number of children who sleep in the streets to be less than 1,000, although this
 number fluctuates widely during the weeks between Christmas and Carnival, when
 
 
 children from the region are attracted to the city by the large number of tourists
 and festivals.
 NGO's in Rio de Janeiro have made enough shelters available for homeless chil-
 dreh, but some children prefer the freedom and drugs that street life offers. NGO's
 report that extreme poverty at home or sexual abuse by fat~hers and stepfathers are
 the principal reasons so many children choose to live in the streets. A national study
 of rape cases carried out by a group of Sao Paulo academics indicated that family
 members committed roughly 70 percent of rapes within their own homes. An IBGE
 study reported that 47 percent of Sao Paulo children come from families that earn
 less than $200 per month. Nationwide, the Inter-American Development Bank esti-
 mates that some 30 million children live below the poverty line and increasingly
 come from households headed by women.
 Because street children have a high rate of drug use and- have been involved in
 assaults and robberies, a significant portion of the public supports harsh police
 measures against them, viewing the issue as one of crime and security, not human
 rights. According to the Children and Adolescents Defense Center (CEDECA) in
 Bahia, 207 children were killed in the city of Salvador in 1997, an increase of 39
 percent over 1996. Through August 53 children under the age of 17 were killed in
 Salvador. CEDECA attributes the vast majority of these homicides to the action of
 police and death squads. Government and NGO resources for street children have
 not been able to keep up with the high demand.
 Homicide has become the leading cause of death among 15- to 17-year-olds, with
 its rate more than tripling since, 1980, according to a survey published in November
 1997. The survey, conducted by IBGE and the United Nations Children's Fund,
 found that 23.5 percent of deaths in that age- group were homicides, compared with
 7.8 percent in 1980. Among children between the ages of 10 and 14, homicide ac-
 counted for 5.1 percent of all deaths. In Rio de Janeiro, according to the Division
 for the Protection of Children and Adolescents and the Court of Infancy and Youth,
 approximately 659 minors were shot to death in 1996, up from 596 in 1995.
 The Government continued its campaign against sex tourism and child prostitu-
 tion, a significant problem throughout the country, but particularly prevalent in the
 major coastal tourist cities in the northeast The media reported on the spread of
 child prostitution from coastal cities to the rural interior of the northeast, particu-
 larly in towns located on well-traveled highways. Children's rights advocates in the
 northeastern states of-Bahia, Alagoas, and Ceara warned that the importance of sex
 tourism in encouraging child prostitution has been overstated and that local social
 conditions have fueled demand for child prostitutes. The Federal District has a 24-
 hour number for -reporting cases of sexual abuse, E special police unit to investigate
 sexual crimes against children, and special teams at all clinics and hospitals to treat
 child victims of violence or sexual abuse.
 One NGO, the SOS Children Center, in operation about 18 months, operates a
 toll-free hot line for reporting :sexual exploitation of minors. It has received 1,000
 credible reports from throughout the country, of -which 20 involved trafficking to for-
 eign countries.
 People With Disabilities.-The Constitution contains several provisions for the dis-
 abled, stipulating a minimum wage, educational'opportunities, and access to public
 buildings and public transportation. However, groups that work with the disabled
 report that state governments failed to meet the legally mandated targets for edu-
 cational opportunities and work placement. There was little progress in the elimi-
 nation of architectural barriers to the disabled.
 According to the Federal Ministry of Education, in 1997 only 5 percent of the esti-
 mated 6 million school age children with disabilities had access to specialized in-
 struction. Throughout the country, only 43 percent of school districts offer special
 instruction for disabled children. In the nine states in the-northeast, only 24 percent
 offer special instruction.
 Indigenous'People.-Brazil's approximately 330,000 Indians, who speak 170 dif-
 ferent languages, have a constitutional right to their traditional lands. The Con-
 stitution also recognizes the social organizations, customs, languages, and beliefs of
 -indigenous people. However, indigenous rights groups expressed concern that in
 practice the authorities allow indigenous peoples only limited participation in deci-
 sions affecting their lands, cultures, traditions, and the allocation of natural re-
 sources. They also criticized the Government for devoting insufficient resources to
 provide health care and other basic services and to protect indigenous reserves from
 non-Indians. Illegal mining, logging, and ranching are serious problems on Indian
 lands, -leading to degradation of the land and violent disputes with non-Indians who
 have occupied a majority of these lands. On May .20, Francisco de Assis Araujo of
 the Xucuru tribe, a prominent campaigner for the indigenous population, was killed
 
 
 529
 in Pesqueira, Pernambuco. He had defended the land claims of his tribe, whose
 lands are being encroached upon by ranchers.
 The 1988 Constitution charged the Federal Government with demarcating indige-
 nous areas within 5 years. As of year's end, the Government had completed the de-
 marcation process of roughly 115,000 square miles, bringing the total proportion of
 identified indigenous lands that have been demarcated legally from 16 percent to
 55 percent. This included demarcation of the 20.7- million-acre Vale do Javari re-
 serve in the state of Amazonas, the largest in the country. The Government has
 identified 11 percent of the national territory for indigenous people.
 In January 1996, the Government issued decree 1775, which allows nonindige-
 nous parties to challenge demarcations based on property claims. The Government
 argued that the decree was necessary in order to balance its constitutional obliga-
 tions both to demarcate indigenous lands and to protect the rights of property own-
 ers. Although indigenous rights activists severely criticized the decree at the time
 of its promulgation, it has accelerated the demarcation process rapidly by transfer-
 ring the adjudication of property claims from the extremely slow and inefficient civil
 courts to an administrative process overseen by the Ministry of Justice.
 Within the procedures set forth in the decree, the National Indian Foundation
 (FUNAI) rejected within 7 months all 419 of the challenges made in 1996. In 1997
 then-Justice Minister Nelson Jobim overturned decisions made by FUNAI and
 upheld claims brought against the demarcation of nine indigenous areas, including
 the Raposa Serra do Sol, by the Macuxi, Taurepang, Ingariko, and Wapixana tribes.
 In December the Federal Government issued a decree recognizing the original
 boundaries of the Raposa Serra do Sol indigenous area, effectively overturning Min-
 ister Jobim's decisions. FUNAI may now complete the demarcation process of
 Raposa Serra do Sol as it was originally identified.
 The court of justice in Ilheus, southern Bahia, ruled that the Pataxo tribe was
 the legitimate heir to some 133,000 acres of land in Bahia. However, the chances
 of recovering any of this land from the 280 large landowners who occupy the terri-
 tory appear slim.
 The Constitution provides Indians with the exclusive use of the soil, waters, and
 minerals on indigenous lands, subject to congressional authorization. In granting
 authorization, the Constitution stipulates that the views of the affected communities
 must be considered and that the communities also must "participate" in the benefits
 gained from such use. However, legislation regulating mining on indigenous lands
 is pending before the Congress. The Catholic Church-affiliated Indigenous Mission-
 ary Council (CIMI) criticized the regulations within the legislation that would pro-
 vide for indigenous groups' approval of mining concessions and their participation
 in the profits from mining on the grounds that they do not sufficiently address the
 constitutional rights of indigenous people.
 Due partly to the Government's failure to provide adequate medical care, as re-
 quired by law, indigenous people have suffered epidemics of malaria, measles, and
 tuberculosis. The National Health Foundation reported that 40 percent of the
 Yanomami tribe suffered from malaria. The infant mortality rate among the
 Yanomami in 1997 was 13 percent, while infant mortality among non-Indian resi-
 dents was only 1.5 percent. According to health workers' unions, poor working condi-
 tions and lack of resources from the Government make it very difficult for health
 workers to travel into indigenous areas to provide sufficient medical care.
 Members of the Pataxo community in the state of Bahia in June accused federal
 deputy and medical doctor Roland Lavigne of initiating a program of mass steriliza-
 tion among Pataxo women in exchange for votes during his 1994 electoral campaign.
 Pataxo women were reluctant to have children because of the general level of pov-
 erty in their community, and campaign workers reportedly convinced them that
 sterilization was the only effective form of birth control. CIMI claims to have inde-
 pendently confirmed that Lavigne sterilized at least 56 Pataxo women over the last
 4 years. In the small settlement of Itaju do Colonia, all 10 of the women of child-
 bearing age of the Pataxo Ha-ha-hae tribe were sterilized. CIMI reported that
 Lavigne paid campaign workers according to the number of Pataxo women brought
 to area hospitals. Pataxo leaders claimed that the sterilizations were a deliberate
 program of genocide intended to eliminate their tribe and free their land for farmers
 who illegally occupy the Pataxo reserve. Pataxo leaders requested federal police pro-
 tection in August after receiving threats from farmers who are settled on their land.
 The Government is investigating Lavigne for illegally offering services in ex-
 change for votes, providing medical services to Indians without FUNAI approval,
 misuse of public health funds, and performing illegal sterilization operations on
 women under the age of 25. CIMI accused FUNAI of failing to meet its constitu-
 tional requirement to protect the Pataxo.
 
 
 Religious Minorities.-Human rights activists continued to express concern be-
 cause of discrimination against Jews by neo-Nazi groups in the south. According to
 a staff member of the Sao Paulo state assembly's Human Rights Committee, over
 300 incidents of neo-Nazi inspired violence have occurred since 1992; 204 of those
 incidents occurred in Sao Paulo state.
 NationallRaciallEthnic Minorities.-Although racial discrimination has been ille-
 gal since 1951, darker skinned citizens say that they frequently encounter discrimi-
 nation. Legislation in force since 1989 specifically prohibits, among other practices,
 denial of public or private facilities, employment, or housing to anyone based on
 race. A 1997 amendment to this law added prohibitions against and jail terms for
 the incitement of racial discrimination or prejudice and the dissemination of racially
 offensive symbols and epithets. In July researchers from the Folha de Sao Paulo
 newspaper reported knowledge of ouly three convictions handed out since the laws
 passage in 1989. No appeals court has ever considered a case under the law, con-
 fiming a lack of convictions. The Folha report quoted a knowledgeable federal offi-
 cial as saying that the three levels of the justice system responsible for implement-
 ing the law (police, prosecutors, and judges) are incapable of recognizing racism
 against blacks. Police and prosecutors often do not consider cases of discrimination
 brought to them by blacks to be serious matters.
 In Sao Paulo human rights activists continued to express concern because of dis-
 crimination against blacks and poor persons from the northeast by neo-Nazi groups
 in the south. A group of human rights activists led by the chairman of the Sao Paulo
 state assembly's Human Rights Committee called for investigation intd the use of
 the Internet by racist organizations to disseminate illegal propaganda. The chair-
 man identified the National Socialist Union for Sao Paulo and the National Front
 for Order and Progress as two of the groups. In August a university student in Sao
 Paulo was charged under the antidiscrimination law with disseminating racially of-
 fensive materials on the Internet.
 Most blacks are found among the poorer sectors of society. According to govern-
 ment statistics released in August, a male head of household with black or mixed
 African ancestry, with a high school education or less, earns on average 48 percent
 as much as his white counterpart. Women in the same category earn an average
 of 46 percent as much as white females. Other government statistics show that the
 monthly per capita income for white males is 6.3 times the minimum wage; for
 white women, 3.6 times the minimum wage; for black men, 2.9; and for black
 women, 1.7. Illiteracy is also a problem: 32 percent of blacks are illiterate, compared
 with 14 percent of whites. Of 30,000 students at the University of Sao Paulo in
 1997, only about 1,000 were black.
 Even though nearly half of the population has some African ancestry, very few
 senior officials in government, the armed forces, or the private sector are black.
 Black consciousness organizations challenge the view that Brazil is a racial democ-
 racy with equality for all regardless of skin color. They assert that racial discrimina-
 tion becomes most evident when blacks seek employment, housing, or educational
 opportunities.
 Blacks are often the victims of violence at a level disproportionate to their per-
 centage in the population. For instance, a human rights NGO active in the north-
 east, the Luiz Freire Cultural Center, has reported that of the 1,378 murder victims
 in Recife in 1994, 87 percent were black.
 A much higher percentage of blacks are convicted by courts than whites, according
 to professor Sergio Adorno of the University of Sao Paulo's Nucleus for the Study
 of Violence. Adorno analyzed 500 criminal cases judged in Sao Paulo courts in 1990
 and found that 60 percent of whites able to afford their own lawyers were acquitted,
 while only 27 percent of blacks who hired lawyers were found not guilty.
 In September 1997, the Federal GovernmenVs Interministerial Working Group for
 the Valorization of the Black Population issued 29 recommendations, including the
 creation of affirmative action programs for university admissions and government
 hiring. The group is charged with proposing public policies to increase the participa-
 tion and access of Afro-Brazilians in society. The Presidents public acknowledge-
 ment in November 1995 that racism and discrimination exist was unprecedented,
 for presidents had maintained in the past that persons were discriminated against
 because they were poor, not because of their skin color.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Labor Code provides for representation of all
 workers (except members of the military, the uniformed police, and firemen) but im-
 poses a hierarchical, unitkr system funded by a mandatory union tax on workers
 and employers. The Cardoso Government, with support from the unions, proposed
 abolishing the tax. The measure awaited approval by the Congress at year's end.
 
 
 The sole bureaucratic requirement for new unions is to register with the Ministry
 of Labor, which by court decision must accept the registration and record it.
 Under a restriction known as "unicidade' (one per city), the code prohibits mul-
 tiple unions of the same professional category in a given geographical area. The
 1988 Constitution freed workers to organize new unions out of old ones without
 prior authorization of the Government, but retained other provisions of the old
 Labor Code. All elements of the labor movement as well as the International Con-
 federation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) criticize the retention of unicidade. The
 Government promised to end unicidade but has not yet proposed legislation to do
 so.
 Unicidade has proven less restrictive in recent years, as more liberal interpreta-
 tions permitted new unions to form and, in many cases, to compete with unions and
 federations that had already enjoyed official recognition. In practice, unicidade is en-
 forced by the system of labor courts, which retain the right to review the registra-
 tion of new unions and to adjudicate conflicts over their formation. This often can
 result in complicated jurisdictional quarrels. A splinter group used the principle of
 unicidade to resist a consolidation movement by the Workers' Unitary Central
 (CUT) and formed its own metalworkers' local in the ABC industrial suburbs of Sao
 Paulo in 1995. The dispute took 3 years and numerous court appearances by all con-
 cerned before reaching a settlement. The settlement, approved by a majority of the
 members of the unions involved, provided for the reincorporation of the dissident
 union into the Sao Paulo ABC's metalworkers' union.
 Otherwise, unions are independent of the Government and, at least nominally, of
 political parties. Approximately 20 to 30 percent of the work force is organized, with
 well over half this number affiliated with an independent labor central. Intimidation
 of rural labor union organizers and their agents continues to be a problem.
 The Constitution provides workers the right to strike (except for the military, po-
 lice, and firemen). Enabling legislation passed in 1989 stipulates that essential serv-
 ices must remain in operation during a strike and that workers must notify employ-
 ers at least 48 hours before beginning a walkout. The Constitution prohibits govern-
 ment interference in labor unions, but provides that "abuse" of the right to strike
 (such as not maintaining essential services, or failure to end a strike after a labor
 court decision) is punishable by law. In the case of public employees, the Constitu-
 tion specifies their right to strike, subject to conditions enacted by the Congress.
 Since the Congress has yet to pass the complementary legislation, labor and legal
 experts debate the limits of the right to strike for public employees. In practice, the
 Government has not interfered with their right to strike. However, in May 1995,
 a month-long strike by Petrobras (the public oil monopoly) employees greatly incon-
 venienced the public and was judged abusive by the Supreme Labor Court.
 Petrobras subsequently dismissed 59 union members. The strike caused many-in-
 cluding labor leaders-to call for limits on public employees' right to strike.
 CUT, the parent central of the petroleum workers' unions, submitted a complaint
 to the International Labor Organization (ILO) Committee on Freedom of Associa-
 tion, arguing that the firing of 59 union members as a result of the strike was in
 effect a violation of the right to strike. In November 1995, the ILO body found that
 the nature of the labor court's procedures, which allow either party to submit a dis-
 pute for what amounts to binding arbitration, 'nay effectively undermine the right
 of workers to strike and does not promote effective collective bargaining." The ILO
 recommended that the legislation be amended so that disputes can be submitted to
 judicial authorities only with the permission of both parties or in a case of interrup-
 tion of essential services. The ILO also recommended that the workers be rehired.
 The ILO further argued that the high fines levied on the local unions for defiance
 of a court order to return to work amounted to a serious limitation of the right to
 strike. In July President Cardoso signed into law an amnesty for the fines that the
 courts had levied on the petroleum workers' unions, and Petrobras rehired the 59
 workers, effectively ending the dispute.
 Teachers, autoworkers, municipal transit workers, metalworkers, and dock and
 port workers all went on strike during the year. In addition, in August federal cus-
 toms officers conducted a work-to-rule slowdown that had the same impact as a
 strike in delaying the processing of both imports and exports. Formerly, the courts
 almost automatically ruled strikes abusive; in recent years the courts have applied
 the law with more discretion. The 1989 strike law prohibits dismissals or the hiring
 of substitute workers during a strike, with certain exceptions, provided that the
 strike is not ruled abusive.
 Although the law makes no provision for a central labor organization, three major
 groups have emerged: the Workers' Unitary Central, the Workers' General Confed-
 eration (CGT), and the Forca Sindical (FS). A fourth central, the Social Democratic
 Union (SDS), emerged in September 1997. The centrals do not have legal standing
 
 
 532
 to represent professional categories of workers, but all three centrals effectively can
 acquire such standing by a   iating with existing statewide federations or nation-
 wide confederations, or by forming new federations and confederations.
 Unions and centrals freely affiliate with international trade union organizations.
 All three major centrals are affiliated with the ICFTU.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The Constitution provides for
 the right to organize. With government assistance, businesses and unions are work-
 ing to expand and improve mechanisms of collective bargaining. However, the scope
 of issues legally susceptible to collective bargaining is narrow. The labor court sys-
 tern exercises normative power with regard to the settlement of labor disputes, dis-
 couraging direct negotiation. The Cardoso Government made expansion of collective
 bargaining one of its major objectives in the labor sector. The Minister of Labor who
 took office in April reemphasized this point.
 In mid-1995 the Cardoso administration promulgated a provisional measure that
 simultaneously ended inflation indexing of wages, allowed for mediation of wage set-
 tlements if the parties involved so desired, and provided greater latitude for collec-
 tive bargaining. Unions have welcomed these changes, since previously the Labor
 Court and the Labor Ministry had responsibility for mediation in the preliminary
 stages of dispute settlement. In many cases free negotiations set wages; labor court
 decisions set them in others. Under the provisional measure, parties now may
 choose mediation freely.
 The ILO notes that important differences in wages continue to exist to ihe det-
 riment of women and blacks, particularly in the rural sectors (see Section 5).
 The Constitution incorporates a provision from the old Labor Code that prohibits
 the dismissal of employees who are candidates for or holders of union leadership po-
 sitions. Nonetheless, dismissals take place, with those dismissed required to resort
 to a usually lengthy court process for relief. In general, the authorities do not effec-
 tively enforce laws protecting union members from discrimination. Union officials
 estimate that only 5 percent of'such cases reaching the labor court system are re-
 solved within days through a preliminary judicial order. The other 95 percent gen-
 erally take 5 to 10 years (and sometimes longer) to resolve.
 Labor law applies equally in the free trade zones. The unions in the Manaus Free
 Trade Zone, like rural unions and many unions in smaller cities, are relatively
 weaker vis-a-vis industry than unions in the major industrial centers.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Although the Constitution pro-
 hibits forced labor, there were credible reports of forced labor in many parts of the
 country. The Catholic Church's Pastoral Land Commission continued to report on
 cases of forced labor in some states. Forced labor is common on farms that produce
 charcoal for use in the iron foundries and the steel industry, and in the sugar indus-
 try (see also Section 6.d.).
 Federal authorities admit that enforcement resources are inadequate and, as a re-
 sult, state and federal officers have been unable generally to conduct timely inves-
 tigations of compulsory labor, although their record is improving. The Government
 passed legislation in December further defining forced labor and prescribing specific
 penalties for those convicted under the law.
 Local police acknowledge that overseers or owners of many farms withhold pay
 from migrant laborers and use force to retain and intimidate them, but such viola-
 tions fall within the jurisdiction of the federal Ministry of Labor, which has 3,000
 inspectors for the entire country. Because of its limited resources, the Ministry gen-
 erally investigates only those cases for which it has received a complaint.
 The Federal Government has a task force to combat forced labor. The task force
 includes representatives from five different ministries and uses federal law enforce-
 ment officers across the borders of the various states, so that enterprises cannot rely
 on friendly local authorities to escape punishment. To support task force activities,
 the Ministry of Labor created mobile inspection teams directed by regional centers
 throughout the country. During 1995-97, the teams carried out more than 400
 raids, which uncovered more than 130,000 persons working under conditions of
 forced labor. The CPT has noted that the task force's effectiveness sometimes is
 hampered by its inability to arrive in an area without advance warning and by the
 often minimal collaboration of the federal police. In an effort to combat forced labor,
 in 1997 the CUT initiated a 24-hour hot lie with a toll free number for reporting
 instances of forced labor. However, the persons responsible for exploiting forced
 labor usually go unpunished because freed workers are often afraid to testify
 against those who recruited and supervised them, and because the authorities have
 found it difficult to identify and locate the owners of farms or businesses that ex-
 ploit forced labor.
 The law prohibits forced and bonded labor by children, but it is not enforced ade-
 quately. Labor organizations continue to aegeothat in  nig and the rural econ-
 
 
 533
 omy thousands of workers, including minors, are hired on the basis of false prom-
 ises, and subjected to debt bondage and to violence if they try to escape.
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment.-The Gov-
 ernment amended the Constitution in December to raise the minimum working age
 from 14 to 16 years. Under the amendment, apprenticeships may only begin at age
 14; previously, judges could authorize apprenticeships for children beginning at 12
 years of age. However, the authorities rarely enforce additional legal restrictions in-
 tended to protect working minors under age 18, and the problem is widespread. In
 recognition of this, the Ministry of Labor has initiated a special effort to protect
 working adolescents, with pilot programs underway in a number of states. The Con-
 gress is considering a government proposal to amend the Constitution to prohibit
 all labor by children under the age of 14.
 The law requires permission of the parents for minors to work, and working mi-
 nors must attend school through the primary grades. Schooling is free and compul-
 sory for the first six grades, and available in all parts of the country. The majority
 of children remain in school until age 14. The law bars all minors from night work,
 work that constitutes a physical strain, and employment in unhealthful, angerous
 or morally harmful conditions. However, the Government estimates that 60,000 chil-
 dren work in unhealthful conditions. The law prohibits forced and bonded labor for
 all workers, including children. However, enforcement varies considerably depend-
 ing on the location (see Section 6.c.).
 Despite legal restrictions, official figures state that nearly 3 million 10-to--14-year-
 old children were employed, accounting for 4.6 percent of the work force. Many chil-
 dren are forced by economic necessity to work alongside their parents in cane fields,
 cutting hemp, or feeding wood into charcoal ovens; frequent accidents, unhealthy
 working conditions, and squalor are common in these cases.
 The authorities rarely enforce legal restrictions intended to protect working mi-
 nors under the age of 18, and the problem of child labor is serious. Enforcement
 of restrictions is limited by the small number of inspectors available. Inspection suf-
 fers from a lack of resources and, as with forced labor, inspectors generally act on
 the basis of complaints and tips concerning the use of child labor. However, when
 inspections do take place, they are effective. Employers illegally using child labor
 have been fined heavily for their offenses.
 A report published by the Sergipe state government in 1997 stated that 10,000
 children and adolescents between the ages of 6 and 18 were part of the labor force
 in the orange growing region, with 54 percent between the ages of 7 and 14. Sergipe
 has acknowledged that the problem of child labor is widespread, and the state
 launched a federally funded program in May aimed at encouraging families to keep
 children in school rather than at work in the orange groves.
 Sugar cane growers illegally employ children and adolescents ranging from 7 to
 17 years of age, many cutting cane with machetes. The charcoal industry, hemp cul-
 tivators in the northeast, and orange growers all have used illegal child labor. Chil-
 dren also perform various tasks in the mining and logging industries in the Amazon
 region. In addition, although both the Government and the industry have made
 strong effots to eliminate it, there is still some child labor in the shoe industry.
 The private sector and particularly the Toy Manufacturers' Foundation for Chil-
 dren's Rights (Abrinq) have been active in trying to remedy many of these abuses.
 Abrinq reached an agreement with the Sao aulo state sugar producers to remove
 child labor from that industry. In addition, Abrinq persuaded Abecitrus, the citrus
 export organization, to agree to remove child labor from its operations. Because of
 Abrinq's efforts, Volkswagen and General Motors, as well as other automakers, are
 studying the role of child labor in charcoal production, which is used to produce the
 cast iron and steel used in cars. Both manufacturers agreed to cease using products
 in which child labor is an element.
 Abrinq has emphasized not just ending child labor but also putting children into
 good-quality schools. The shoe manufacturers in the city of Franca, with the help
 of Abrinq, virtually eliminated child labor there and enhanced the educational op-
 portunities of children whom they formerly employed. A similar project with Min-
 istry of Labor direction has been successful in removing child labor from the shoe
 industry in Rio Grande do Sul. In Mato Grosso do Sul, a government-sponsored
 project has taken children from the charcoal industry there to the classroom, with
 parents receiving roughly the equivalent of the child's monthly earnings as long as
 the child attends school. The project, which began with 1,000 children, has been ex-
 panded to involve nearly 2,500 children.
 Because of the success of the program in Mato Grosso do Sul, the Ministry of
 Labor expanded the program to the sugar producing regions of Pernambuco, where
 20,000 children participate, and to the hemp-growing area of Bahia, which has a
 program for more than 8,000 children. In addition, the Ministry has begun a pro-
 
 
 534
 gram to raise public consciousness concerning child labor, which Ministry officials
 consider the key to eradication of the problem.
 In October 1997, the Sao Paulo state government promulgated a law that pro-
 hibits the state from using contractors who exploit child labor.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The minimum wage is approximately $111
 (130 reals) a month, which is not sufficient to provide a decent standard of living
 for a worker and family. A recent survey by the Getulio Vargas Foundation deter-
 mined that the poverty level is 45 reals a month per person. However, a 1997 study
 by the Interunion Department of Socioeconomic Studies and Statistics concluded
 that the minimum wage was only slightly more than one-fourth that necessary to
 support a family of four. The Interunion study weighed urban data more heavily
 than did the Vargas Foundation, accounting for some of the disparity of these con-
 clusions. Many workers, particularly outside the regulated economy and in the rural
 northeast, reportedly earn less than the minimum wage.
 The Constitution limits the workweek to 44 hours and specifies a weekly rest pe-
 riod of 24 consecutive hours, preferably on Sundays. The Constitution provides for
 pay and fringe benefits and establishes new protection for agricultural and domestic
 workers, although not all provisions are en forced. All workers in the formal sector
 receive overtime pay for work beyond 44 hours, and there are prohibitions against
 excessive use of overtime.
 Unsafe working conditions are prevalent throughout the country. Fundacentro,
 part of the Ministry of Labor, sets occupational, health, and safety standards, which
 are consistent with internationally recognized norms. However, the Ministry has in-
 sufficient resources for adequate inspection and enforcement of these standards.
 There are also credible allegations of corruption within the enforcement system. If
 a worker has a problem in the workplace and has trouble getting relief directly from
 an employer, the worker or union can file a claim with the regional labor court, al-
 though in practice this is frequently a cumbersome, protracted process.
 The law requires employers to establish internal committees for accident preven-
 tion in workplaces. It also protects employee members of these committees from
 being fired for their committee activities. Such firings, however, do occur, and legal
 recourse usually requires years for resolution. While an individual worker does not
 have the legal right to depart a workplace when faced with hazardous conditions,
 workers may express such concerns to the internal committee, which would conduct
 an immediate investigation.
