 THE GAMBIA
 The Gambia is ruled by President Yahya A.J.J. Jammeh, the former chairman of
 the Armed Forces Provisional Ruling Council (AFPRC) that seized power in a coup
 d'etat in 1994, deposing the democratically elected government of Sir Dawda
 Jawara. Jammeh became President following controversial elections in September
 1996, which observers considered neither free nor fair. Following his election,
 Jammeh dissolved the AFPRC and declared the Cabinet to be the sole ruling body
 until the election of the National Assembly and the adoption of a new Constitution.
 Four of the 13 Cabinet members are retired army officers who were Jammeh's allies
 during or immediately following the coup, and the armed forces strongly support the
 Government. In January the Constitution of the Second Republic came into effect,
 restoring formal constitutional government, and citizens chose a new National As-
 
 
 sembly in elections whose results generally were accepted by the opposition.
 Jammeh's party, the Alliance for Patriotic Reorientation and Construction (APRC)
 won 33 of the 45 Assembly seats filled by-election. Although formal constitutional
 rule was restored, key constitutional provisions have not been tested in the courts
 and opposition forces continue to encounter official interference. The judiciary re-
 portedly has been at times subject to executive branch pressure, but courts dem-
 onstrated their independence in 1997 in a number of cases.
 The Gambian National Army (GNA) reports to the Minister of Defense (who is
 now the President). The police report to the Minister of Interior. The National Intel-
 ligence Agency (NIA), established in 1995 by overnment decree, reports directly to
 the President but is otherwise autonomous. embers of the security forces commit-
 ted serious human rights abuses.
 The Gambia's population of just over 1 million consists largely of subsistence
 farmers growing rice, millet, maize, and groundnuts (peanuts), the country's pri-
 mary export crop. The private sector, led by reexporting, fisheries, horticulture, and
 tourism, contracted after the 1994 coup but is regaining strength. However, cuts in
 international economic assistance coupled with high population growth and a poor
 harvest have hampered any rapid economic growth. Per capita gross domestic prod-
 uct is estimated to be $360.
 The Government's human rights record improved somewhat, but serious problems
 remain. President Jammeh's dominance and restrictions on opposition parties con-
 tinued, and in practice citizens still do not have an effective right to change their
 government, however, legislative elections held in January were accepted by the op-
 position; presidential elections are scheduled for 2001. Security forces beat detainees
 and, in one serious incident, security officials detained and tortured eight opposition
 party supporters. Prison conditions remained poor. On occasion security forces arbi-
 trarily arrested and detained citizens, and the courts are traditionally responsive to
 executive branch pressure, although they demonstrated their independence. The
 Constitution declares illegal the prosecution of any member of the AFRC for any of-
 ficial act or omission in the performance of official duties following the 1994 coup.
 The Government limited freedom of assembly and association. Although opposition
 forces were active and vocal in the National Assembly, decrees limiting certain polit-
 ical and other human rights remained in effect. Government intimidation of the
 press continued, and the independent press practiced self-censorship. The right to
 travel and the right to transfer funds or assets remained restricted for some senior
 officials of the former Jawara government facing corruption charges. Discrimination
 and violence against women persists. While government health professionals have
 focused greater attention on the dangers of female genital mutilation, the practice
 is widespread and entrenched.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 . a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no confirmed reports of
 political or other extrajudicial killings.
 The circumstances of the death of Yaya Drammeh, a rebel accused of treason, at
 Mile 2 prison on May 25 have not been publicly explained. Drammeh was one of
 five men accused of treason for his role in an attack on an army barracks in Novem-
 ber 1996 during which six soldiers were killed.
 In October a group of soldiers patrolling a beach shot and killed a man. The De-
 partment of State for Defense offered official condolences and stated the matter
 would be "judiciously and expeditiously addressed." At year's end there had been no
 reports of arrest or charges.
 There were no 'developments in the 1995 deaths of Saidbou Haidara or Finance
 Minister Ousman Koro-Ceesay. The opposition continued to use the lack of effective
 investigation in these cases to criticize the Government.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution forbids torture or inhuman or degrading punishment. However,
 agents of the State used torture on at least one documented occasion, and security
 forces also beat military and security detainees.
 In June eight United Democratic Party (UDP) officials and supporters (seven men
 and one woman) were arrested, detained at National Intelligence Agency (NIA)
 headquarters, and tortured by security forces. At a press conference, they revealed
 cuts, bruises, and lacerations on their bodies. Other reports indicated more serious
 physical abuses. On June 26, the Government promised a full investigation and ap-
 propriate action by the Attorney General. Since the incident, police investigators
 have interviewed some witnesses; however, no one has been arrested and no results
 
 
 127
 of the investigation have been made public. The press and human rights observers
 also report the detention and severe beating of UDP member Yaya Sanneh, who was
 arrested by soldiers on July 27. Sanneh was reportedly held for several days aftr
 makingcomments about an abortive attack on a military base near the border with
 tSIenbegaeal.
 Prison conditions at Mile 2 and Janjanbureh prisons remained poor. Mile 2 prison
 was reported to be austere, overcrowded, and lacking in medical facilities. Prisoners
 are locked in their cells for over 20 hours each day. There were credible reports of
 beatings, malnourishment and other harsh treatment of political, military, and secu-
 rity detainees. Women are housed separately.
 In Jueneewspaper reports claimed that there was a riot at Mile 2 Prison in
 which 12 prisoners were injured. Two reportedly later died of the injuries. The Gov-
 ernment contested these reports and spediically denied that any prisoners had been
 killed. In July police raided Mile 2 prison in an attempt to curb reported drug traf-
 icking and poor performance b security guards. Subsequently, however, a number
 of prison guards were dismisse and the prison was placed un er new management.
 Conditions in one local jail were reportedly unsanitary and overcrowded. Inmates
 slept on cement benches or the floor with no blankets. There was one water tap in
 the cell area, but often no water.
 Following visits by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), in late
 1996 the Government agreed in principle to prison visits by the African Center for
 Democracy and Human Rights Studies (ACDHR). The ICRC visited Mile 2 prison
 at least twice in 1997, but by year's end there had been no" visits by the A~DR
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The new Constitution includes provisions
 to provide protection against arbitrary arrest and detention. However, on occasion
 security forces arbitrarily arrested and detained citizens. Periods of detention
 ranged from a few hours to 5 days. In 1995 the AFPRC declared by decree that the
 NIg would have the power to search, seize, detain, or arrest any individual or prop-
 eIty without due process, and that the Minister of Interior could order a 90-day de-
 tention without charge and not subject to writ of habeas corpus. In 1996 Decree 66
 gave the Minister of Interior authority to extend detentions without charge for re-
 newable 90-day increments. These decrees have not been formally revoked, and the
 new Constitution provides that such decrees remain in effect until found to be in-
 consistent with its provisions. The Government has stated that it no longer enforces
 these decrees; in practice the Government appears not to enforce them. The Con-
 stitution now requires that detainees be brought before a court within 72 hours and
 police appear to be respecting this provision in practice.  w
 While approximately 30 people have been briefly held and questioned, the last
 oup of      iical detainees (including former member of Parliament Lamin Waa
 Juwara) dating from the AFPRC regime was released on February 3.
 Three opposition supporters were detained without charges for several days in
 March. Eight opposition party officials and supporters were detained for 5 days in
 June and tortured in detention (see Section 1.c.). In July another opposition party
 member reportedly was detained for several days and tortured. In other instances,
 opposition party supporters and officials were held for questioning for periods of less
 than 1 day.
 In January journalist Moco Mccauley was detained for 2 days, charged with work-
 ing illegally, and threatened with deportation to Liberia. After his release, Mccauley
 fled to Sierra Leone, citing harassment from the Government.
 In July police called in for questioning journalists Alhagi Yorro Jallow and Alien
 Badara Sowe, demanded that they reveal their sources, detained them briefly, and
 summoned them for questioning several times over a period of several days. Both
 Jallow and Badara had written articles reporting a prison riot.
 The Government did not exile opponents. However, former President Jawara re-
 mains outside the country under threat of arrest and detention on corruption
 charges if he returns. Other senior officials of the former government, e.g., Vice
 President Saihou Sabally, and Secretary General Abdou Sara Janha, also remain
 outside the country but do not face official charges.
 e. Denial of Fair Public TriaL-The Constitution provides for an independent judi-
 ciary; however, the judiciary reportedly has been at times subject to executive
 branch pressure, but courts demonstrated their independence in 1997 in a number
 of cases. For example, in October the Court of Appeal, the country's highest court,
 overturned the treason convictions and death sentences of four men who led an
 abortive coup in November 1996. The Government is appealing this decision to the
 Privy Council in London. The Court of Appeal has also overturned several criminal
 convictions in less publicized cases.
 The judicial system comprises a Judicial Committee of the Privy Council (based
 in London), the Court of Appeal, high courts, and the eight magistrate's courts. The
 
 
 new Constitution provides for an October 1998 reconfiguration of the courts in
 which a Supreme Court would replace the Privy Council as the ultimate court of
 appeal. Village chiefs preside over local courts at the village level.
 The AFPRC appointed a number of commissions to investigate individuals and or-
 ganizations suspected of corruption during the First Republic. These commissions
 have powers similar to a grand jury, with additional authority to recommend the
 seizure of assets, to imprison and fine for contempt, and to imprison or demand
 bond from individuals considered likely to abscond. There is a ban on political activ-
 ity by ministers of the former government and three plitical parties. This ban is
 inconsistent with the new Constitution, but has not  en chalenged in court or
 withdrawn by the Government. Violation of the ban is punishable by life imprison-
 ment.
 The judicial system recognizes customary, Shari'a, and general law. Customary
 law covers marriage and divorce for non-Muslims, inheritance, land tenure, tribal
 and clan leadership, and all other traditional and social relations. Shari'a law is ob-
 served primarily in Muslim marriage and divorce matters. Under Shari'a women re-
 ceive half of what men receive in inheritance. General law, following the English
 model, applies to felonies, misdemeanors in urban areas, and the formal business
 sector. Trials are public, and defendants have the right to an attorney at their own
 cost.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 new Constitution prohibits such abuses, and the Government generally respects
 these prohibitions in practice. The Government, however, has not canceled Decree
 45, which abrogated constitutional safeguards against arbitrary search, but remains
 formally in effect pending a finding by a court of law that the decree is inconsistent
 with the Constitution. In practice the Government appears not to enforce it.
 In March three UDP members were arrested at the party leader's house and held
 without charges for a few days. In November police briefly disrupted a political
 gathering at the same house.
 On June 8 a number of UDP activists were arrested at a cinema hall and another
 was arrested in the street outside a minister's home. On September 25, two UDP
 party secretariat members were arrested on private premises while holding a meet-
 ing. They were released without charge the same day. An editor of the New Citizen,
 which repeated the inaccurate charge in a UDP press release that the party mem-
 bers were tortured by poice, was detained for 6 hours, told that he would be
 charged with causing public alarm, and released without charge but warned that
 the matter was still under investigation.
 Observers assume that the Government monitors citizens engaged in activity that
 it deems objectionable. In the past, surveillance included monitoring of telephones
 and mail. Various investigating commissions made indings this year resulting in
 the forfeiture of private property, principally that held by former government and
 parastatal officials. The work of these commissions, which began under the AFPRC
 regime, is sanctioned under the new Constitution with provisions for due process.
 It is not clear, however, that the full rights of due process were accorded to officials
 investigated by the commissions before the Constitution took effect. The evidentiary
 standards applied by the commissions in ordering the forfeiture of money and prop-
 erty are not clear, and orders by the commissions have not yet been subject to effec-
 tive judicial review.
 The Government restricted the right to transfer funds or assets of some senior of-
 ficials of the former Jawara government accused of corruption.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The new Constitution provides for freedom of
 speech and the press; however, in practice the Government significantly limits the
 full exercise of these freedoms by using police pressure and laws that inhibit the
 media.
 In January two foreign journalists and one foreign employee, working for the
 independent newspaperThe Daily Observer, were deported for working out of sta-
 tus, after the paper ran a series of articles critical of immigration authorities. Daily
 Observer offices were visited several times by immigration police and by the Na-
 tional Intelligence Agency. In October the editor of the Daily Observer was deported
 for failing to pay certain payroll taxes.
 The Government employed arrest, detention, and interrogation to intimidate jour-
 nalists and newspapers that published articles that it considered inaccurate or sen-
 sitive (see Section 1.d.). Decrees 70 and 71, enacted in March 1996, required all
 newspapers to post a $10,000 bend or ease publication. These derees and the  ear
 of reprisals and government action have had a chilling effect. Although still inde-
 
 
 endent, the nongovernment press grew cautious, with the four major independent
 ailiespracticing a significant degree of self-censorship. However, strong criticism
 of the Government is nonetheless frequent, and opposition views appear in the inde-
 pendent press. English, French, and other foreign newspapers and magazines are
 available.
 Radio broadcasts from one government and two private stations normally reach
 listeners in the eastern part of the country. Government radio and television cover
 opposition remarks made in the National Assembly, but otherwise serve as propa-
 ganda instruments for the Government and its supporters. Private radio stations si-
 mulcast news provided by Radio Gambia, the government station, but independent
 news is also broadcast. Senegalese and international radio broadcasts attract wide
 audiences. Wealthy private consumers also use satellite systems.-
 There is no university, but a university extension program completed its second
 academic year in August. There are no reports of any government restrictions on
 academic freedoms.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 freedom of assembly; however, the Government restricts this right in practice. Al-
 though AFPRC's 1996 Decree 89 formally lifted the ban on political activities, the
 authorities rarely grant the principal opposition party (UDP) authorization for pub-
 lic meetings, andeven private meetings were broken up by the security services.
 The Constitution provides for freedom of association; however, the Government
 limited this right in practice. Decree 89 also banned three major opposition political
 parties, all former presidents, vice presidents, and ministers from political activity;
 the penalty providing life imprisonment for an individual or a $100,000 fine for an
 organization considerably restricted political activity. Despite the fact that the de-
 cree apparently conflicts with the new constitutional provisions, the decree has not
 been challenged in court. The three major parties have not resumed activity nor
 have the various political figures done so.
 On November 21, police tightly restricted people and vehicles permitted at the air-
 port to welcome the return of UDP leader Darboe and a state house guard fired
 upon a press vehicle covering Darboe's return. On November 22, riot police unsuc-
 cessfully attempted to break up a UDP welcome home party at Darboe's residence.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the
 Government respects this right in practice. Adherents of all faiths are free to wor-
 ship without government restriction. In June the imam of the mosque at Statehouse
 aroused concern when he criticized the Ahmadi Islamic sect, and the expatriate
 leadership and expatriate staff of the sect left the country, claiming fear of persecu-
 tion. The Government intervened in the dispute and subsequently the sect agreed
 to the return of the expatriates to their leadership and technical functions with mis-
 sionary work to be conducted by local Ahmadi.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Constitution provides for freedom of movement but allows for "rea-
 sonable restrictions.' Although freedom of movement for ordinary citizens remained
 unimpeded, the authorities prohibited those under investigation for corruption or se-
 curity charges from leaving the country. A number of journalists and government
 officials have been required to produce travel clearances, but former ministers have
 received their passports and the leader of the opposition UDP and other opposition
 figures have traveled outside the country without incident.
 The Government cooperates with the office of the United Nations High Commis-
 sioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and other humanitarian organizations in assisting ref-
 ugees. The Government provides first asylum and it provided for approximately
 3,000 persons from Liberia and Sierra Leone in 1997, including approximately 1,800
 Sierra Leoneans who sought refuge this year. There were no reports of forced expul-
 sion of those having a valid claim to refugee status, although some male Sierra
 Leoneans who fled by boat in June were not allowed to disembark in Banjul. The
 Government works with the UNHCR in approving cases: The UNHCR identifies
 those that qualify for asylum or refugee status and the Government approves. There
 were no reports of persons forced to return to countries in which they feared perse-
 cution.
 The Gambia hosts approximately 8,000 refugees from Sierra Leone, Senegal, Libe-
 ria, and other countries. The Government continues to host approximately 3,500
 Senegalese refugees from the Casamance region, including some 1,500 who arrived
 during the year. The Government continued to work with the UNHCR, the Gambian
 Red Cross, and other organizations in dealing with refugees. In November 1996, fol-
 lowing an attack on a military barracks near the Senegalese border, the Govern-
 ment reviewed the status of many of the refugees from Liberia and Sierra Leone,
 but there were no reports of forced expulsion of those having a valid claim to refu-
 gee status.

 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Despite a new Constitution and January legislative elections, in practice citizens
 still do not have an effective right to change. their government. Citizens attempted
 to exercise the right to change their government through a democratic process in
 presidential elections held in 1996. However, the few international observers that
 were present noted serious problems in the electoral process. Foreign governments
 condemned the election as not free and fair primarily because of restrictions im-
 posed by the Government on opposition campaign efforts and access to the govern-
 ment-owned media prior to the election.
 In January the Constitution of the Second Republic came into effect, and citizens
 chose a new National Assembly in elections whose results were accepted by the op-
 position. Opposition activity in the National Assembly is becoming increasingly sig
 nificant and opposition assembly members state their views forceully. In Febrary
 members of the opposition UDP briefly walked out of the National Assembly in pro-
 test of an APRC candidate nomination. However, political activity is still restricted
 by the Government's frequent refusals to authorize opposition meetings and by the
 continuing authority of Decree 89, which although apparently unconstitutional has
 not been challenged in the courts. Decree 89 bans three former political parties and
 all persons who held the offices of President, Vice President, and minister since
 1965 from involvement in politics until 2024.
 During the campaign p rior to the January parliamentary elections, President
 Jammeh was accompanied by a security entourage that included a military vehicle
 with an antiaircraft gnn and another military vehicle with a machine gun. Opposi-
 tion attempts to organize and engage in public politics are still frustrated by police
 refusals to grant permits and by the detention of activists. For example, in early
 1997, one former UDP National Assembly candidate and some colleagues were orga-
 nizing a meeting. The meeting was not disrupted, but the candidate and a colleague
 were ordered to report to the police. They were detained for approximately 8 hours,
 although not charged.
 The Constitution provides for the democratic election of the President every 5
 years. National Assembly elections are held 3 months after the Presidential elec-
 tions.
 The Constitution prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex, and there are no
 ohstacles to the participation of-women in government. The Vice President and 3
 of the 15 ministers in the Cabinet are women.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of human Rights
 There     several organizations whose mandates provide for human rights mon-
 itoring. The AFPRC's Decree 81 of 1996 requires nongovernmental organizations to
 e with a National Advisory Council, which has the authority to deny, sus-
 register cancel any NGO's right to operate (including that of international NGO's).
 Government, however, did not take action against any NGO's during the year.
 There are two major organizations whose primary mandate is the promotion of
 human rights-the International Society for Human Rights (ISHRA) and the Afri-
 can Center for Democracy and Human Rights Studies (ACDHSR). Both ISHRA and
 ACDHRS have conducted training in democratic rights and civic education.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The new Constitution prohibits discrimination based on race, sex, religion, disabil-
 ity, language, or social status. The Government generally respects these prohibi-
 tions. Howeve statements by the imam of State House in June prompted the with-
 drawal of the expatriate leadership and professional staff of the Asadi religious
 sect. The Government later provided the sect with assurances against persecution.
 Women.-Domestic violence, including abuse, is occasionally reported;its occur-
 rence is believed to be fairly common. Policetend to consider these incidents to be
 domestic issues normally outside their ordinary jurisdiction.
 Shari'a law is usually applied in divorce and inheritance. Marriages are usually
 arranged, and polygyny is practiced. Women normally receive a lower proportion of
 assets distributed through inheritance than do male relatives.
 Empoyent in the formal sector is open to women at the same salary rates as
 men. No statutory discrimination exists in other kinds of employment, although
 women are generally employed in endeavors such as food vending or subsistence
 farming.
 Traditional views of women's roles result in extensive societal discrimination in
 education and employment. Families generally educate male children before female
 
 
 131
 children. Females constitute about one-third of primary school students and roughly
 one-fourth of high school students.
 Active women s rights groups exist, focused primarily on economic advantages and
 the elimination of female genital mutilation (FGM).
 Children.-The Government is committed to children's welfare. The Department
 of Education and the Department of Health, Social Welfare and Women's Affairs are
 the two most generously funded of all departments. However, lack of resources lim-
 its state provision of both education and health services.
 The new Constitution mandates free compulsory primary education, but given the
 current state of the educational infrastructure, this provision represents a goal and
 not an accomplishment. There is no effective compulsory education. Opportunities
 for secondary education are even more limited. The care and welfare of children in
 distress is considered primarily a family responsibility. Authorities intervene when
 cases of abuse or mistreatment are brought to their attention.
 The practice of female genital mutilation which is widely condemned by inter-
 national health experts as damaging to both physical and psychological health, is
 widespread and entrenched. Reports place the number of women having undergone
 FGM anywhere from 60 to 90 percent. Seven of the nine major ethnic groups prac-
 tice FGM at ages vaiying from shortly after birth until 18 years old.- The Govern-
 ment in recentyears has publicly supported the eradication of FGM and discourages
 FGM through health education. However, FGM carried out with parental consent
 is not considered a criminal act. The Government has not passed legislation against
 FGM and, in the absence of legislation, the judiciary is not prepared to address the
 problem.
 People With Disabilities-There are no statutes or regulations requiring acces-
 sibility for the disabled. No legal discrimination against the physically disabled ex-
 ists in employment, education, or other state services. Severely disabled individuals
 subsist primarily through private charity. Less severely disabled individuals are
 fully accepted in society and encounter no discrimination in employment for which
 they are physically capable.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Labor Act of 1990, which applies to all workers
 except civil servants, specifies that workers are free to form associations, including
 trade unions, and provides for their registration with the Government. It specifically
 prohibits police officers and military personnel, as well as other civil service employ-
 ees, from forming unions or striking. About 20 percent of the work force is employed
 in the modern wage sector, where unions are most active. Roughly 30,000 workers
 are union members, comprising about 10 percent of the work force.
 The Gambian Workers Confederation and the Gambian Workers' Union are the
 two main independent and competing umbrella organizations. Both are recognized
 by the Government.
 The Labor Act authorizes strikes but requires that unions give the Commissioner
 of Labor 14 days' written notice before beginning an industrial action (28 days for
 essential services). It prohibits retribution against strikers who comply with the law
 regulating strikes. Upon application by an employer to a court, the court may pro-
 hibit industrial action that is ruled to be in pursuit of a political objective. The
 Court may also forbid action judged to be in breach of a collectively agreed proce-
 dure for settlement of industrial disputes. Because of these provisions and the weak-
 ness of unions, few strikes occur.
 Unions may affiliate internationally, and there are no restrictions on union mem-
 bers' participation in international labor activities. The country applied in June
 1995 to join the International Labor Organization. It has been accepted in principle,
 but must make modifications to its labor and employment laws.
 b, The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The Labor Act of 1990 allows
 workers to organize and bargain collectively. Although trade unions are small and
 fragmented, collective bargaining takes place. Each recognized union has guidelines
 for its activities specified by the appropriate industrial council established and em-
 powered by the Labor Act. Union members' wages exceed legal minimums and are
 determined by collective bargaining, arbitration, or agreements reached between
 unions and management after insuring that the agreements are in compliance with
 labor law. No denial of registration has been reported. The act also sets minimum
 contract standards for hiring, training, terms of employment, and provides that con-
 tracts may not prohibit union membership. Employers may not fire or discriminate
 against members of registered unions engaged in legal union activities.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Constitution prohibits com-
 pulsory labor, and it is not known to occur.
 
 
 Although the Government does not formally prohibit forced or bonded labor by
 children, it is not known to occur. Most children performing customary chores or
 who are engaged in petty trading do so as a part of an extended family.
 d. Status of Child Labor Practicesand Minimum Age for Employment.-The stat-
 utory minimum age for employment is 18 years. There is no effective compulsory
 education, and because of limited secondary school opnings most children complete
 formal education by age 14 and then begin work. Employee labor cards, which in-
 clude a person's age, are registered with the Labor Commissioner, but enforcement
 inspections rarely take place. Child labor protection does not extend to youth per-
 forming customary chores on family farms or engaged in petty trading.
 Although the Government does not formally prohibit forced or bonded labor by
 children, it is not know to occur (see Section 6.c.).
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-Minimum wages and working hours are estab-
 lished by law through six joint Industrial Councils-Commerce, Artisans, Transport,
 Port Operations, Agriculture, and Fisheries.
 Labor, management, and the Government are represented on these councils. The
 lowest minimum wage is about $1.16 (12 dalasis) per day for unskilled labor. This
 minimum wage is not sufficient to provide a decent standard of living for a worker
 and family. Only 20 percent of the labor force, those workers in the formal economic
 sector, are covered by the minimum wage law. The majority of workers are privately
 or self-employed, often in agriculture. Most citizens do not live on a single worker's
 earnings but share resources within extended families.
 The basic legal workweek is 48 hours within a period not to exceed 6 consecutive
 days. A 30-minute lunch break is mandated, nationwide, the workweek includes 4
 8-hour work days and 2 4-hour work days (Friday and Saturday). Government em-
 ployees are entitled to 1 month's paid annual leave after 1 year of service. Private
 sector employees receive between 14 and 30 days of paid annual leave, depending
 on length of service.
 The Labor Act specifies safety equipment that an employer must provide to em-
 ployees working in designated occupations. The Factory Act authorizes the Ministry
 of Labor to regulate factory health and safety, accident prevention, and dangerous
 trades and to appoint inspectors to ensure compliance with safety standards. En-
 forcement is spotty owing to insufficient and inadequately trained staff. Workers
 may refuse to work in dangerous situations and may demand protective equipment
 andclothing for hazardous workplaces.
