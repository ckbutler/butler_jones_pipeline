 ZAIRE
 Following independence in 1960, Zaire experienced almost
 seven years of civil war or semi-anarchy. President
 Mobutu's main task over the last thirteen years has been
 to reestablish the Government's authority over a vast
 country with more than 200 often mutually antagonistic
 ethnic groups. In these exceptionally difficult political
 circumstances, and against the background of Zaire's
 tragic early years of independence, the Government has not
 yet succeeded in developing institutions to protect basic
 human rights. President Mobutu developed a tightly
 centralized, one-party political system to bring the
 country under effective political and administrative
 control from the capital of Kinshasa. The invasions of
 Shaba Province in March 1977 and May 1978 undercut the
 Government's fragile sense of security and resulted in
 numerous violations of human rights. Military assistance
 received from friendly countries helped the Government to
 reestablish authority. However, major improvements in the
 human rights field will depend on progress in refining and
 revitalizing the economy, in ending corruption, in disci-
 plining the military and in broadening political access
 and participation. Economic and political reforms have
 begun in some areas. If pursued and accompanied by
 measures to improve the nation's security apparatus,
 these could lead to improvements in the human rights
 field.
 A separate report by the Congressional Research Service
 (CRS) published in July 1978, and dealing almost exclusively
 with events of 1977 and earlier, reaches similar conclusions
 about the causes, kinds and frequency of human rights
 violations in Zaire.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 
 (192)
 
 
 There have been reports alleging the use of torture by
 Zairian officials, notably in the preliminary report on
 Zaire by Americans for Democratic Action. The Department
 of State has been unable to confirm these reports.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment and punishment
 occur from time to time. Such treatment appears to be
 largely the result of arbitrary actions by poorly-led
 and badly-paid civil law enforcement and military
 personnel who use their positions to abuse and intimidate
 the public.
 In February 1977, fourteen alleged rebels were summarily
 hanged in public by members of a Zairian military unit.
 At least some of the victims' bodies were subsequently
 mutilated by a Zairian soldier. While these executions
 reportedly were not authorized by the Zairian Government,
 the perpetrators of the executions were not brought to
 account.
 In April, several prison and justice officials, including
 the former Minister of Justice, were convicted of
 embezzling funds earmarked for prisoners' food, thereby
 contributing to the deaths of a significant number of
 prison inmates in 1977. The Zairian Government's
 investigation preceding the trial is reported to have
 resulted in a sharp decline in 1978 in prison death
 attributed to malnutrition. Prisons still tend to be
 crowded, unsanitary and poorly provided with food and
 medicines. In part this reflects Zaire's poor economic
 situation as well as administrative failures. Of three
 prisons visited by international organization authorities
 in Shaba in 1978, only one was found adequate. Nutritional
 and health conditions in the others were well below
 standard.
 c. Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 During 1978, President Mobutu freed about five well-known
 political prisoners, notably former Foreign Minister
 Nguza Karl-I-Bond. The President also issued a general
 amnesty for all opponents of the regime living in
 
 
 194
 neighboring countries. However, in 1978, as part of
 the Government's reaction to the Shaba war and its
 aftermath, arbitrary arrests and imprisonment increased
 over the previous year. It is estimated that 1,000 to
 1,500 individuals were arrested in the Shaba region and
 transported to the Lokandu detention camp in the Kivu
 region. The International Committee of the Red Cross
 was denied access to these detainees. According to
 sources, including one former detainee, conditions in
 the camp were very poor, with an absence of medical care
 and food that resulted in the deaths of some of those
 detained. The government closed the detention camp in
 October 1978, releasing all detainees. The former
 prisoners have been encouraged by the government to
 settle in rural rather than urban areas. Government
 officials in Shaba also arrested a small number of those
 who returned to Zaire under the general amnesty noted
 above as suspected adherents of or collaborators with
 the rebel ex-Katanga gendarmes.
 As he has done in the past, President Mobutu has issued
 public instructions that corrupt policemen and soldiers
 are to be punished for their misdeeds. They nevertheless
 continue to rob and otherwise abuse the population,
 particularly in Shaba. However, the presence in Shaba
 of the Inter-African Forces, composed of Moroccan,
 Senegalese, and other non-Zairian troops, greatly
 reduced the incidence of the worst excesses.
 Involuntary impressment into the Army is common but
 sporadic.
 d. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The Government of Zaire revamped its judicial system in
 1978. One of the main objectives was to facilitate
 prompt trials and to eliminate extended pretrial
 detention. However, some critics maintain that provisions
 of the new Judicial Code may have the effect of
 depriving citizens of sufficient time to prepare
 adequate legal defense. All judges, including those on
 the Supreme Court, were placed under the new office of
 the President of the Judicial Council. All legal
 decisions can be sent down for reconsideration by
 decision of the President of the Judicial Council.
 
 
 195
 Since the judiciary is not independent, it does not
 provide a check on the executive branch of government.
 Persons charged with what are deemed to be non-political
 crimes are entitled to, and have often received, a fair
 public hearing by an impartial tribunal. One objective
 of the judicial reorganization noted above was to
 reduce the level of corruption in the courts. President
 Mobutu has repeatedly denounced the prevalence of
 "justice for the highest bidder." Those accused of
 political crimes or certain civil infractions, such as
 trafficking in precious minerals, have usually been
 tried in the state security court. In some cases
 political crimes are judged by ad hoc courts.
 The fourteen alleged rebels executed by Zairian authori-
 ties in February 1977 (see l.b. above) are not known to
 have been charged nor tried in a court. In March 1978,
 the government held a public trial of 84 alleged
 terrorist conspirators accused of plotting a coup.
 many observers believe the prosecution failed to prove
 its case against many of the defendants, and question
 the court's impartiality. Immediately after the trial,
 thirteen of the convicted conspirators were executed by
 firing squad. Sixteen defendants were acquitted, while
 49 were sentenced to prison terms ranging from one to
 twenty years.
 e. Invasion of the Home
 Invasion of the home seldom occurs. When it does, it
 is usually without approval of the responsible Govern-
 ment official. During the 1978 Shaba war and its
 aftermath, mass break-ins and arrests took place during
 searches, sometimes only ostensible, for rebels and
 their sympathizers.
 2. Governmental Policies Relating to the Fulfillment
 of Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care
 and Education
 The living standard continued its precipitate decline
 during 1978. Economic mismanagement and corruption
 contributed to this decline. There were indications as
 of late 1978, however, that economic reform efforts
 
 
 196
 were underway which, if continued and enforced, should
 improve the medium term economic situation. These measures
 included: (A) first steps toward improving the recapture
 of foreign exchange earnings; (B) agreement to staff
 certain key economic positions with foreign experts
 supplied by international institutions; and (C) substantial
 devaluation of the currency.
 In the meantime, wages lagged far behind inflation in 1978
 for the third consecutive year. The continued erosion of
 workers' purchasing power reduced many urban workers to
 poverty. The government channelled inadequate resources
 into progress which would help sustain or improve Zairian
 living standards. The deterioration of the agricultural
 sector continued, for example, with the decline in invest-
 ment in such vital infrastucture as roads and railways.
 Peasants reverted to subsistence farming when cash crops
 could not be transported to market. Corruption continued
 to be a major factor impeding economic development and
 contributing to the decline in government services.
 Health care continued to decline; the best hospitals
 lacked basic medicines and supplies, and rural clinics
 had next to nothing. Upper income consumption of luxury
 imports remained high.
 Elementary and secondary educational institutions, which
 were largely returned to Church management in 1977, have
 begun a slow recovery from detrimental effects of government
 control over the preceding five years. The standards and
 facilities at the state-run National University continue
 to deteriorate.
 3. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Includ-
 ing:
 a. Freedom of Thought, Speech, Press, Religion
 and Assembly
 In November 1978 the Legislative Council (parliament)
 exercised its newly acquired right to "interpellate"
 Cabinet members, including the Foreign Minister i.e.,
 to present formal questions that require public reply
 in person before parliament by the department head
 responsible). During fifteen hours of debate spread over
 two days, the legislature sharply questioned the Prime
 
 
 197
 Minister, three other ministers and one deputy minister
 for alleged administrative deficiencies. The questioning,
 conducted with notable candor, was broadcast live on
 television and radio. Virtually the entire text
 of the debates was also published in one of Kinshasa's
 two daily newspapers. Encouraged by this example of
 open political discussion, politically aware Zairians
 expressed the hope that this trend would continue.
 The press is permitted to print comment and complaints
 dealing with broad segments of Zairian life, but
 the President or his family and associates are not
 criticized. Foreign press and periodicals are occasion-
 ally censored or prohibited. Freedom of assembly is
 prohibited unless under the aegis of the single political
 party.
 Four religions -- Protestantism, Catholicism, Kimbanguism,
 and Islam -- are officially recognized by the Govern-
 ment of Zaire. All other religions are illegal, but
 judicial sanctions are sporadic. While the threat of
 government interference remains, there were few restric-
 tions on the recognized religious institutions in 1978.
 Despite the public reading and wide distribution of a
 pastoral letter that was highly critical of current
 socio-economic conditions, for example, the Government.
 continued to tolerate censure from the pulpit. Christmas,
 banned as an official holiday since 1972, was restored
 to Zaire's calendar in 1978.
 b. Freedom of Movement within the Country, Foreign
 Travel and Emigration
 Foreign travel an emigration are generally unrestricted.
 However, the Government occasionally delays or denies
 issuance of exit visas to individuals. Movement within
 the country is generally unrestricted, but temporary
 limitations may be imposed on travel to specific areas
 such as Shaba.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Participation in the one-party political process is
 obligatory. All Zairians aged eighteen and over must
 vote. Local, regional, and party elections were held
 
 
 198
 in the fall of 1977. There were no scheduled elections
 in 1978. Although there is some freedom of debate
 within the party's politburo and some attention to
 grass-roots views, important decisions are ultimately
 taken by Mobutu.
 Zairian women can attain positions of reponsibility;
 one woman serves as member of the cabinet. In general,
 status of women in Zaire is strongly influenced and
 limited by African custom and tradition.
 Zaire has a single legal labor movement, the National
 Union of Zairian Workers (UNTZa). It is subordinate to
 the ruling party. In August 1978, for the second
 year in a row, UNTZa held elections.
 The government officially deplores, and its constitution
 bans, ethnic and social discrimination, but regional
 and tribal factors affect access to jobs, both in
 government and private sectors, and to higher education.
 Recently the Zairian Army was purged of many members of
 the Shaban and Kasaian tribes and in its subsequent
 recruitment drive few were recruited from those areas
 or from Bandundu.
 4. Government Attitude and Record Regarding Inter-
 national and Non-governmental Investigation of
 Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 During 1978 missionaries and international organ-
 izations, including the International Committee of the
 Red Cross and the United Nations High Commissioner for
 Refugees, were permitted to operate relatively freely
 in Zaire. Although a formal request to visit a detention
 camp was not granted before the camp's disbandment,
 several other prisons were inspected during the year.
 Zaire continued to harbor refugees from almost every
 country along its border as well as from southern
 Africa during 1978. While it has only limited resources
 for meeting the refugees' needs, the Zairian Government
 facilitated the work of several international bodies
 which provided assistance to them. Successful efforts
 to normalize relations between Zaire and Angola made
 
 
 199
 possible the return of large numbers of Zairian refugees
 living in Angola. However far fewer Angolan refugees
 living in Zaire chose to return home.
