 BURUNDI
 Burundi is a one-party state under the leadership of
 President Jean-Baptiste Bagaza, who came to power in
 1976 in a bloodless coup d'etat. His government
 espouses a program of national reconciliation between
 the two major population groups and reforms in both the
 political and economic spheres. The key problems
 facing the country are economic. Landlocked Burundi is
 a poor, densely populated country with most people
 living at a subsistence level on tiny farms scattered
 over the country's hilly terrain. The nation has few
 natural resources, and the remaining unused arable land
 and forests are under increasing pressure because of
 population growth. The literacy rate and general
 education levels are low. Health care is meager.
 Politically, a crucial factor is the country's communal
 structure. While all Burundians speak the same language
 and have the same culture, the minority Tutsi (15
 percent of the population), traditionally cattle
 herders, have for centuries dominated the political,
 social and economic life of the country. From time to
 time this domination has led to violence as the majority
 Hutu (84 percent of the population) who are traditionally
 farmers, have tried to increase their power. The most
 recent and devastating example of this occurred in
 1972, during the government-sanctioned massacres which
 left over 200,000 Burundians, mostly Hutu, dead or
 refugees in neighboring countries. To address these
 problems the government has given major emphasis to
 economic development and to various political reforms
 designed to win the confidence of the Burundian people
 as a whole. Traditionally a poor but well-managed
 economy, Burundi has in recent years received increasing
 amounts of foreign assistance, most of it concentrated
 in the key agricultural sector. Political reforms have
 included the abolishment of a head tax, the promulgation
 of a new legal code on the family giving increased
 rights to women, a substantial reduction in the role of
 the military in government affairs, the strengthening
 of Burundi's sole political party, Uprona, which
 entailed a large-scale membership campaign, and, most
 recently, the announcement of a new constitution which
 was the subject of a popular referendum on November
 18, 1981. The. new constitution provides for basic civil
 rights guarantees, an elected national assembly, and
 election of the president for a five year term by
 universal suffrage. President Bagaza was confirmed in
 office in 1979 and will not have to face election until
 1994. As yet, no date has been set for national
 assembly elections.
 
 
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 Several articles of the Burundi penal code deal with
 the treatment of prisoners. Torture is forbidden by
 law and there were no reports of torture in 1981.
 Beatings occasionally occur during the arrest and
 questioning of prisoners, particularly those who
 threaten violence against the police, resist arrest,
 or are arrested in connection with violent crimes.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Executions, which take place only after due process,
 are rare. Prisons are overcrowded and dirty, and
 prisoners arrested for violent crimes such as rape or
 murder and those who resist arrest may be ill-treated.
 The government claims to discipline police and prison
 officials guilty of abusing prisoners. There is no
 independent information to confirm or refute these
 claims. Freedom House in 1981 noted reports of brutality.
 c. Disappearances
 There have been no reports of disappearances.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 The state has broad police powers which permit arbitrary
 arrests and imprisonment. For example, individuals
 have been arrested as a form of harrassment for indiscreet
 behavior, e.g., criticizing the president or his
 policies. However, these powers are used sparingly.
 Legally, a person may be held for only five days before
 being charged, but some are detained for longer periods
 of time. Preventive detention exists but is not common.
 e. Denial Of Fair Public Trials
 Burundi law provides for speedy public trials with
 counsel. The law specifies that charges must be stated
 formally within five days of an arrest. The lack of
 trained legal personnel often causes delays from
 several weeks to more than a year. By law, the judiciary
 is independent of the executive and the military, but
 there are indications that occasional munipulation
 on purely political grounds does occur.
 A state security court was established by presidential
 decree on April 17, 1980, and was provided for in the
 new constitution. It has jurisdiction over both civilian
 and military personnel who are accused of acts against
 the state. The mandate of the court allows it jurisdiction
 over almost any felony case the government chooses to
 refer to it. The court is presided over by the president
 of the supreme court and four counsellors appointed by
 the president. The counsellors are nominated by
 the minister of justice. The counsellors must comprise
 one representative from the judiciary, one from the
 military and two public individuals. The prosecutor
 before the supreme court represents the state before
 the security court as well. The main difference
 between the state security court and the civilian
 
 
 33
 courts are that state security court proceedings need
 not be public and the only form of appeal is a motion
 for reconsideration before the same court. No cases
 have been brought before the court since its establishment.
 f. Invasion of the Home.
 Court warrants are required by law for an official to
 enter a private residence. Exceptions sometimes occur
 in politically-related cases, e.g., if an individual is
 suspected of plotting against the state. There have
 been reports of other kinds of violations of the home
 such as bugging or demolition.
 2. Respect For Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 The government controls all domestic media. The
 French-language daily "Le Renouveau" and the Kirundi
 language weekly "Ubumwe" are published by the ministry
 of information, which also runs the only domestic radio
 station. Editorial direction comes from the presidency
 and is pro-government, but occasionally editions have
 featured muted criticims of government mismanagement
 and raised political and economic issues. There
 is no television station in Burundi, and in November
 1980 the government seized all television sets used by
 Burundi nationals to watch telecasts from Zaire.
 Foreign movies are subject to censorship, but cuts are
 generally made only on material deemed sexually explicit
 which might offend public morals. Normally there is no
 interference with the distribution of foreign publications.
 The government encourages academic inquiry into the the
 social sciences.
 The express authorization of the government is required
 for all political meetings or speakers, and this
 effectively guarantees government control of public
 fora. The labor movement is affiliated with the
 country's only political party and follows government
 policy. wildcat strikes lasting a few hours have
 occurred, but a government-controlled mediation
 process rules out any longer or officially-sanctioned
 strikes. A presidential decree issued in 1981 prohibits
 strikes by government officials. Despite these constraints,
 members of the labor movement assemble often and have
 frank discussions.
 Freedom of religion is slightly restricted in Burundi.
 Government insistence that religious groups meet only
 on Sunday has met with opposition. In addition, the
 involvement of many foreign missionaries in social work
 with the poor, who are overwhelmingly Hutu, has at
 times aroused government suspicion and led to the
 expulsion of missionaries from the country. However,
 very few expulsions have taken place since 1979 when 74
 missionaries were forced to leave. The government has
 not prevented church and missionary groups from
 replacing expelled missionaries or refused admission to
 new arrivals. The government has made clear that
 churches are free to carry out their work, but must
 confine their activities to religion and stay out of
 political matters.
 
 
 b. Freedom of Movement within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration and Repatriation
 Movement is generally free within Burundi. There is no
 curfew. Foreign travel and emigration are open to
 all. The government encourages voluntary repatriation.
 Burundi's refugee and asylum practices are humane.
 Cooperation with the United Nations High Commission for
 Refugees (UNHCR) is close. The country's estimated
 70,000 refugees, primarily Tutsi of Rwandan origin who
 fled to Burundi in the early sixties, receive good
 treatment and most have been successfully resettled.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 The military-backed government rules by decree, without
 popular referendum procedures, and endeavors to control
 all political activity. Only one political party, the
 government-sponsored Uprona party, is permitted. It
 is open to all Burundians who profess allegiance to its
 principles. The government announced in 1979 that a
 membership drive had resulted in over one million new
 members, or over half of the adult population of the
 country. Since Uprona is organized down to the communal
 level, it can in theory act as a vehicle for the
 communication of grass roots political concerns to
 the leadership.
 The position of the party in the structure of the
 government was strengthened substantially at the time
 of the party's national congress in December 1971. The
 49 member Uprona central committee and its eight-member
 politbureau replaced the Supreme Revolutionary Council,
 composed of twenty-nine senior military officers, which
 had ruled Burundi from 1976. Both the politbureau and
 the central committee are chaired by the president, who
 is also president of the party. The membership of the
 central committee and, to a lesser extent, the politbureau
 includes men, women, youth, labor. Hutus are represented
 at the ministerial level of government and are represented
 in the senior ranks of the party but only to a minor
 extent, given the proportion of Hutus in the population.
 The military is represented in each major party body.
 The party undertook in 1980 to draft a constitution
 that was the subject of a referendum in November, 1981.
 The new constitution provides for a strong presidency
 and a national assembly. Both the president and the
 members of the national assembly are to be elected by
 universal suffrage. The president must be the head of
 the Uprona party, but candidates for the national
 assembly need not be party members. The constitution
 contains basic civil rights guarantees, and explicitly
 states that women have the same rights as men.
 3.   Government Attitude and Record Regarding
 International and No)-International Investigation
 of Alleged.Violations of Human Rights
 In 1981 an International Committee of the Red Cross
 team visited Burundi to investigate prison conditions,
 but there have been no other reports to indicate that
 the government has received requests for outside
 
 
 35
 assessments on human rights. However, in its 1981
 report Amnesty International expressed concern at
 detentions without trial in Burundi.
 4.   Economic and Social Circumstances
 Burundi is one of the world's poorest countries and has
 a per capita GNP of $180 (1979). Population density is
 among the highest in Africa, and the population is
 growing at an estimated rate of 2 percent (1970-79).
 The percentage of the population below the absolute
 poverty level was estimated in 1979 at 55 percent for
 the urban population and 85 percent for the rural
 population. The economy is overwhelmingly dependent on
 a primitive agricultural sector which supports 90
 percent of the population. Coffee is the only
 significant cash crop and export, but low world coffee
 prices coupled with severe transport problems to the
 nearest seaport, Dar Es Salaam, have led to a signifi-
 cant decline in hard currency earnings. The low level
 of development affects both Hutu ano Tutsi, with
 differences in economic status between the two groups
 generally not discernable in the countryside. In the
 few urban areas, Tutsi have long dominated government
 and education and continue to have a significant
 edge.
 Health care and nutrition are inadequate. The latest
 available statistic on infant mortality shows a rate
 Qf 140 deaths per 1000 live births (1970). While
 the percentage of the small urban population with
 access to safe water is high, estimated at 94 percentage
 of the much larger rural population is very low. Life
 expectancy at birth was 40.5 years (1980); 39.4 for
 males and 41.7 for females. Calorie supply available
 for consumption relative to nutritional requirements
 has been estimated most recently at 97 percent.
 Education, despite considerable government efforts,
 remains far below the needs of the population. The
 adult literacy rate is 25 percent. Enrollments at the
 primary school level in 1977 were only 23 percent of
 the relevant age group (28 percent for males; 18
 percent for females). Only a small fraction of those
 completing primary school can obtain places in the
 nation's 35 secondary schools. An even smaller percentage
 of students win places in the nation's sole university,
 but once there, they receive high-quality instruction
 in a competitive environment.
 The role of women in society is undergoing considerable
 change. However, women traditionally hold a secondary
 position. Their legal status was improved in the 1980
 legal code on families, and the constitution eliminates
 any further legal basis for discrimination. Fewer women
 than men manage to attain an education, but once an
 education is attained, women can generally find suitable
 employment. In the political life of the country,
 women are represented at all levels. The union of
 Burundian women (UTB), the women's affiliate of the
 Uprona.party, is engaged in several social programs and
 is regularly- called upon to stimulate mass support for
 Uprona party policies.
