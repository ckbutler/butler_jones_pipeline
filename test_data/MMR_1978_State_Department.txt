 BURMA
 The Socialist Republic of the Union of Burma is governed
 under a Constitution promulgated in 1974 after approval
 by national referendum. Under this basic law, President
 Ne Win presides over a one-party form of parliamentary
 government and serves as chairman of the sole legal
 political party, the Burma Socialist Programme Party
 (BSPP). The guiding philosophy of the BSPP reflects
 doctrinaire socialism, Burmese nationalism, and tradi-
 tional Buddhist welfare concepts. Neither the BSPP nor
 the People's Assembly plays a major role in determining
 national policy, however, because all important powers
 are in the hands of the President.
 1.   Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 There have been unverified reports, but no direct evi-
 dence, that the Government employs physical and psycho-
 logical coercion in the course of interrogations in
 cases which have serious political implications or
 involve national security.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Apart from the reports noted in section la, the Depart-
 ment of State is not aware of any pattern of intention-
 ally cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment
 employed by the Burmese Government nor of discriminatory
 treatment against any particular group of prisoners.
 Conditions in Burmese jails are generally very poor and
 overcrowded, but this is primarily a consequence of the
 low standard of living in the country.
 c. Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 Authoritative information is lacking on the size and
 composition of Burma's prison population, but there
 
 (352)
 
 
 353
 are political prisoners. Widespread arrests on politi-
 cal charges occurred under the Revolutionary Council
 prior to 1974. The Department of State believes almost
 all of those arrested were subsequently released.
 The 1974 Constitution prohibited detention without
 arraignment beyond 24 hours, but a 1975 anti-subversion
 law in effect suspended this provision. In instances
 of widespread public disturbances in 1974 and 1975, mass
 arrests were made of students and workers. Over 200
 students were also arrested in March 1976, following a.
 public demonstration. Later in the same year a number
 of Army officers reportedly were detained in connection
 with an alleged plot against the Government, although
 all but six were subsequently released. In 1977, three
 persons were convicted of plotting to overthrow the
 Government after a lengthy, well-publicized trial.
 In the fall of 1977, there were reportedly scores of
 arrests of Party officials in the wake of a BSPP internal
 realignment, but exact numbers are not known.
 The Department is not aware of any major political
 arrests in 1978. Many political detainees are tried on
 criminal charges; others are held or released without
 trial.
 In 1978, approximately 200 students were released prior
 to the completion of their sentences, but others remain
 in jail. Amnesty International's 1977 report stated
 that there were "at least several thousand political
 prisoners" in Burma. The Department of State is unable
 to verify that figure.
 d. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The 1974 Constitution provides for public trial and
 access by Burmese citizens to the courts. The burden
 of proof is on the prosecution, the accused has the
 right to an attorney, and lawyers are permitted to
 practice freely. Justice is administered by a
 system of people's courts with appeal to higher levels
 culminating in the National Council of People's Justices.
 The judges are lay persons untrained in law who are
 selected by the Party. They are advised by professional
 legal officers, usually former judges under the British-
 developed legal system. The advice of these legal offi-
 cers may or may not be accepted. In addition to codified
 law, traditional Burmese notions of community harmony,
 
 
 354
 fair play and socialist concepts are among the factors
 which affect court decisions. In a few cases with
 national political overtones, such as the coup plots
 of 1976 and 1977, judgments and sentences apparently
 have been dictated by the Government.
 e. Invasion of the Home
 The 1974 Constitution guarantees the privacy and secur-
 ity of the home, but it is abridged in practice, espe-
 cially during public disturbances, in situations
 involving insurgent activity, and other instances of
 suspected threats to national security.
 2.   Governmental Policies Relating to the Fulfillment
 of Such Vital Human Needs as Food, Shelter, Health
 Care and Education
 Burma's annual per capita gross national product of
 about $130 places it among the world's poorest countries.
 This poverty limits the Government's abilities to
 improve living conditions. The present Government is
 committed to socialist concepts of social and economic
 justice. Since it took power in 1962, the Government
 has brought about substantial redistribution of wealth
 and has made genuine, if ineffective, efforts to provide
 for the basic needs of its citizens. However, Burma's
 average economic growth rate over the past decade has
 been 3 percent, barely exceeding population growth.
 Most independent local and foreign observers attribute
 the low rate of growth of this potentially prosperous
 nation to the Government's poor management of the
 state-owned economic sector, the lack of capital invest-
 ment and the absence of individual incentive.
 In Burma, the military and political elite generally
 enjoy a higher standard of living than most ordinary
 citizens, although by international standards even the
 elite live very modestly. The impact of corruption on
 the poor is not extensive, but a majority of the popu-
 lation is involved in or tacitly supports a shadow
 black market economy. Officials probably benefit more
 from privileged access to housing, food supplies,
 consumer goods, and transportation and health care
 facilities than from actual corruption.

 3.   Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Includ-
 ing:
 a. Freedom of Thought, Speech, Press, Religion
 and Assembly
 Freedom of expression is limited in Burma and public
 criticism of the leadershiD is not tolerated. Public
 media are government-owned and controlled. The few
 foreign publications permitted to be imported are
 occasionally censored. Foreign radio broadcasts are
 widely and freely available to all who wish to listen.
 Freedom of assembly, however, is restricted. For example,
 secular mass organizations (including labor unions)
 independent from either government or party control are
 banned. Instead, party-sponsored workers' and peasants'
 organizations, youth leagues and similar groups have
 been formed. These organizations provide some oppor-
 tunity for expression of the views of ordinary citizens,
 but largely serve as a means of communicating national
 policies, implementing government programs and other-
 wise enlisting popular support for the Government.
 Freedom of religion is a basic tenet of the 1974 Consti-
 tution and to our knowledge iswidely observed.
 The people of Burma represent a number of different
 ethnic and religious groups. The Kachins and Karens,
 for example, speak their own languages and many are
 Christian. The Shans speak a variant of Thai and share
 Buddhism with the majority Burmans. These differences
 have helped generate considerable communal and religious
 tension throughout Burmese history. Within the areas
 controlled by the Government, these groups live together
 in relative harmony and enjoy more or less equal treat-
 ment. Minority groups are represented in government
 bodies and services, including the highest organs of
 government, although ethnic Burmans retain a numerical
 majority of positions as well as a monopoly on actual
 political power.
 Of the minorities in the remote regions, the Shans,
 Karens and Kachins are the most prominent. Segments of
 each group have long supported armed insurrections of
 varying size and intensity against the Government,
 seeking political control of their respective homelahds.
 Historical separation, economic aspirations, personal
 
 
 356
 ambitions of some insurgent leaders and ethnic and
 religious differences underlie these separatist move-
 ments. Attempts by past Governments to negotiate with
 these minorities have failed to produce settlements.
 For many years the Government has had great difficulty
 in maintaining control over outlying regions, even by
 military means.
 Many of these insurgent groups, including the Burmese
 Communist Party, partially support their efforts against
 the Government by opium production and trafficking in
 narcotics. Also operating in the Shan states of Northern
 Burma are ethnic Chinese-led groups which engage almost
 exclusively in the smuggling of narcotics and other
 goods.
 During the spring of 1978 more than 150,000 South Asian
 Muslims crossed the border into Bangladesh from Burma's
 Arakan State, creating a serious problem for Bangladesh
 and requiring substantial amounts of outside relief.
 Allegations by the Muslims of mistreatment by Burmese
 authorities were denied by the Burmese Government.
 In July an agreement was reached between Burma and
 Bangladesh for the return of virtually all of the
 refugees. As of late December 1978, about 50,000
 refugees had returned to Burma.
 Women in Burma are generally treated on an equal basis
 with men. They share equally in education, enter the
 professions, control family finances, dominate retail
 trade and own a great deal of the real estate.
 They generally have equal status under law and inherit
 equally with men. Only in the political arena are they
 seriously underrepresented.
 b. Freedom of Movement within the Country, Foreign
 Travel and Emigration
 The 1974 Constitution guarantees the right of citizens
 to live anywhere within Burma. Exceptions apply to
 military areas or areas of insurgent activity (at least
 one-half of the country). Non-citizen residents of
 Burma (primarily Indians or Chinese, many of whom were
 born in Burma) are also subject to travel restrictions.
 
 
 In practice, foreign travel is denied to all but a few
 Burmese, mostly military and government officials or
 participants in officially-sponsored or sanctioned
 exchange programs. One of the Government's main
 reasons for restricting foreign travel is to conserve
 scarce foreign exchange. Another is to deter an exodus
 of educated trained manpower. Emigration is permitted,
 although bureaucratic and legal requirements make it a
 lengthy and expensive process for most Burmese.
 The prospective emigrant must resign any government
 job, repay the Government for any higher education,
 and pay advance income tax on anticipated earnings
 abroad.   Emigres who have adopted foreign citizen-
 ship were until recently not permitted to return to
 Burma for even a temporary visit. This restriction
 has been relaxed since 1976.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 The Government and sole legal political party, the BSPP,
 are controlled by President Ne Win. Although there is
 universal suffrage, the electorate has limited choice
 in national and local elections, since there is only
 one slate of candidates for public office, pre-deter-
 mined by the Party. The Party often considers more
 than one candidate for a particular position during the
 period of preparation of the slate and the election
 lists include some non-BSPP candidates, a few of whom
 are elected to office. A candidate must receive at
 least 50.1 percent of the votes cast in order to be
 declared elected.
 Although nominal self-criticism of BSPP policies and
 practices is encouraged within the Party and public
 criticism of government bureaucratic failings is per-
 mitted, public criticism of BSPP policies and perform-
 ance is not tolerated.
 4.   Government Attitude and Record Regarding Inter-
 national and Non-Governmental Investigation of
 Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The Department of State is not aware of any independent,
 outside investigations of human rights conducted within
 Burma. Nor do we know of any requests for such investi-
 gations by internationally-recognized organizations.
