 LUXEMBOURG
 Luxembourg is a constitutional monarchy and parliamentary
 democracy. The Grand Duke is the Chief of State, but his
 duties are mostly ceremonial. Real power rests with the
 12-member Government, headed by the Prime Minister and
 responsible to Parliament, which receives its authority
 through free and fair elections.
 The police respect human rights. The country is free from
 strife, and residents enjoy fair and efficient judicial and
 penal systems.
 Luxembourg is a highly developed, industralized state with a
 free enterprise economic system and a high standard of living.
 Luxembourg continued its commitment to human rights in 1988.
 There were no allegations of abuse during the year.
 Individual human rights are ensured by the Constitution and
 protected in practice, and Luxembourg actively promotes human
 rights internationally. It continues efforts to treat its
 relatively large foreign population fairly and to engage labor
 unions in the industrial decisionmaking process.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 Killing for political reasons has not taken place.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no known abductions or hostage-taking cases.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment, or Punishment
 Torture is prohibited by law and does not occur. Prisoners
 are treated fairly, have free choice of attorneys, are allowed
 visitors, and are housed in modern facilities. Luxembourg
 ratified the Council of Europe Convention for the Prevention
 of Torture on September 6, 1988.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Due process is provided by law and observed in practice.
 Luxembourg law is a composite of local practice, legal
 tradition, and foreign systems--French, Belgian, and German.
 Any person detained by the authorities must be charged no
 later than 24 hours after arrest. Preventive detention does
 not exist, but persons may be incarcerated pending trial, if
 so ordered by a judge. Exile is not imposed. With regard to
 forced or compulsory labor, see Section 6.c.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Luxembourg's judiciary is independent and free from executive
 or military interference. Military courts exist, but
 civilians are not subject to their jurisdiction. The right of
 defendants to have legal counsel, at public expense if
 necessary, is assured. Charges are formally and clearly
 
 
 1126
 LUYEMBOURG
 stated. Defendants have the right to be present at trial, and
 they are presumed innocent until proven guilty. Verdicts may
 be appealed by either the defendant or the State. An appeal
 results in a completely new judicial hearing, and sentences
 can be increased as well as decreased. There are no political
 prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Luxembourg law and customs are based on regard for personal
 freedom. The State, political organizations, and other
 organized entities do not arbitrarily intrude into the private
 lives of Luxembourg residents. Police must have a warrant,
 issued by the judiciary, to enter a private home. Statutes
 prohibit other violations of the home such as demolition, the
 sealing of doors and windows, and electronic surveillance.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution provides for freedom of speech and the press,
 and it is respected in practice. Except for restrictions on
 pornography, there is no censorship of the media. The
 broadcast industry is privately owned, except 4 percent which
 is indirectly controlled by the French Government. The
 industry operates independently from the Luxembourg
 Government. The print media are privately owned and
 controlled. Academic freedom is respected.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Freedom of'peaceful assembly and association is assured
 constitutionally and respected in practice. There are no
 limitations on orderly public meetings. All groups enjoy the
 right of free assembly. For a discussion of freedom of
 association as it applies to labor unions, see Section 6.a.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 There is no state religion in Luxembourg, and one may freely
 practice the religion of one's choice. Statistically,
 Luxembourg is about 90 percent Roman Catholic. This faith is
 deeply intertwined with the conservative culture of the
 country; for example, there is no government funding for
 abortions.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 There are no restrictions on movement within the country
 (including changing residence or workplace), foreign travel,
 or emigration and repatriation. Refugees are treated fairly,
 and they are not forced to return to countries in which they
 fear they would be persecuted. There are no forced
 resettlements.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Luxembourg's Government is democratically elected. All
 Luxembourg citizens 18 years of age and older may participate
 in national elections, held every 5 years, and in local
 elections, held every 6 years. Voting is by secret ballot
 
 
 1127
 LUXEMBOURG
 with multiple candidates for most positions. Luxembourg's
 large foreign population (26 percent) does not have the right
 to vote, but it may exert considerable influence on the
 political process indirectly by joining labor unions or other
 organizations. Opposition groups, including political
 parties, function openly and freely, without fear of
 government repression. Women participate actively in
 Luxembourg's political process. Although there are no women
 in the current Government, the leader of the parliamentary
 opposition and the Mayor of Luxembourg City are both women.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 There were no requests for the investigation of human rights
 abuses. Luxembourg has consistently supported international
 and nongovernmental investigation of alleged human rights
 violations. The Red Cross, Amnesty International, and the
 U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees have representatives in
 Luxembourg.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Discrimination based on the above factors is prohibited by
 law. Adequate food, shelter, health care, and education are
 available to all inhabitants regardless of race, religion,
 sex, ethnic background, or political opinion.
 About 27 percent of working age women are in the paid labor
 force. This is about one-third of all paid workers; however,
 few women in Luxembourg are senior executives. Equal pay for
 equal work is mandated by law. Women and men enjoy the same
 property rights. Property acquired during a marriage is
 divided equally upon dissolution of the marriage, unless a
 prenuptial agreement exists which stipulates how property is
 to be divided. Family members are protected by law. Several
 women's rights groups are active in Luxembourg.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Workers have the right to associate freely, to choose their
 own representatives, publicize views, and determine their
 programs. The two largest industrial unions are linked to,
 but organized independently from, Luxembourg's Socialist Party
 and Christian Social Party respectively. A large percentage
 of the work force is unionized, but membership is not
 mandatory. Workers have the right to strike, although strikes
 are rare. Unions are free from government interference and
 maintain unrestricted contact with international bodies in
 their fields.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 The Constitution ensures freedom of union activity and
 protects union leaders and members from discrimination.
 Unions have the right to organize and bargain collectively on
 behalf of their members, and this right is applied uniformly
 throughout the country. Worker representatives are required
 in all businesses of 15 or more employees. In businesses with
 over 150 employees, 50 percent of the joint works councils are
 elected by the employees. In businesses with more than 1,000
 
 
 1128
 LUXEMBOURG
 employees, one-third of the membership of the boards of
 directors must be employees or their elected representatives.
 An effective system exists to hear and adjudicate employment-
 related complaints.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.
 Forced or compulsory labor does not exist.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 The employment of children under the age of 15 is prohibited.
 Child labor laws are strictly enforced. Adolescent workers
 (ages 15 to 17) are provided special protection by law, such
 as limiting overtime and specifying the number of hours which
 may be worked continuously.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 Luxembourg's health and safety standards are among the highest
 in the world. A safe working environment is mandated by law
 and enforced through a stringent inspection system, which can
 impose severe penalties. Pregnant women who work receive
 special consideration in the workplace. The normal workweek
 is 40 hours, spread over 5 days. Premium pay is required for
 work outside the normal workweek. Work on Sunday is generally
 prohibited, except in certain circumstances such as continuous
 process industries (steel and chemical), and for certain
 workers such as maintenance and security personnel. All
 workers receive a minimum of 5 weeks of paid vacation a year,
 in addition to paid holidays. The minimum wage is $4.35 per
 hour for all workers 18 years of age and older. Younger
 workers are subject to a lower minimum wage. This is $2.60
 per hour for workers 15 years old. The minimum wage increases
 annually until the worker is 18. A supplement is added for
 workers with dependents.
