 AFGHANISTAN
 Invaded by Soviet armed forces in December 1979, Afghanistan
 is now wracked by a country-wide insurgency in which some
 115,000 occupying Soviet troops plus regime forces are pitted
 against the Afghan resistance, or mujahidin, supported by the
 vast majority of the people. This is in keeping with Afghan
 history, in which the greatest moments of common endeavor for
 the independent-minded Afghans occur in the face of foreign
 invasion.
 In 1978, a Marxist-Leninist coup overthrew President Daoud,
 who in 1973 had deposed his cousin, the last Afghan king, and
 established a republican-style government. The 1978 coup
 established the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan, with Noor
 Mohammad Taraki, Secretary-General of the Marxist-Leninist
 People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan, as President of the
 revolutionary council and Prime Minister. Opposition to a
 Communist regime developed almost immediately and spread
 throughout the country. Differences among leaders also
 surfaced and resulted in numerous killings, purges, and
 imprisonments. In March 1979, Hafizullah Amin replaced Taraki
 as Prime Minister, but Taraki kept the office of President.
 In September 1979, intraparty factionalism erupted in a
 showdown between the two leaders, Amin and Taraki, resulting
 in the death, under still unexplained circumstances,-of Taraki
 and the assumption of full power by Amin.
 Against this background, the Soviet Union intervened directly
 on December 27, 1979, and brought by March 1980 its military
 presence to a total of 85,000 troops. Amin and his family
 were killed in a Soviet armored assault against the
 Presidential palace, and in his place the Soviets installed
 Babrak Karmal.
 Soviet influence escalated dramatically after the 1979
 invasion. Soviet advisers moved into controlling positions in
 government ministries, the army, and the security apparatus
 and now either directly make, or are deeply involved in, all
 significant political, military, and social decisions. The
 Soviets dominate the central governmental apparatus while a
 Marxist-Leninist party provides the political front for a
 ruling clique, centered around Babrak Karmal, whose authority
 depends on the presence of Soviet troops.
 The Soviets seek not only to dominate Afghanistan
 strategically but also to reshape this traditional Muslim
 society in the Soviet mold. The slender base of support for
 Moscow's chosen instrument, the Marxist-Leninist People's
 Democratic Republic of Afghanistan, and the determination of
 the resistance, has led the ruling party and its adherents to
 resort to ruthless means to preserve itself in power.
 There was little change in the human rights situation in
 1984. The most pervasive violator of human rights is the
 secret police, Khad. Precise figures are not published, but
 probably more than 25,000 persons work full time for this
 multifaceted organization, modeled on the Soviet KGB. Soviet
 secret police serve as advisers. Khad is responsible for
 foreign and domestic intelligence collection and clandestine
 operations and for maintaining regime control through
 surveillance, arrest, interrogation, and imprisonment.
 Tensions in urban areas continued to be fanned in 1984 by
 systematic violations of the sanctity of the home and person
 
 40-387 0 - 85 - 74
 
 
 1160
 AFGHANISTAN
 as increasingly ruthless Khad forces searched private homes
 for arms, political opponents, military recruits, and loot.
 Outside of Kabul, where regime control is limited or
 nonexistent, human rights continued to be violated on a scale
 unprecedented in recent Afghan history by Soviet and Soviet-
 directed forces. In 1984, the Soviets stepped up the policy
 of harsh reprisals against the civilian populace in militarily
 strategic regions and areas of greatest resistance. In April,
 the strategic Panjsher Valley was subjected to large-scale
 carpet bombing by high-altitude, Soviet-based bomber aircraft
 as a prelude to a largely Soviet military thrust with some
 20,000 troops into a valley which once supported over 100,000
 persons, but which is now virtually deserted. After occupying
 a portion of the valley, Soviet troops systematically
 destroyed cultivated fields and killed livestock. Kandahar
 was repeatedly bombed and strafed by Soviet jets and
 helicopter gunships through 1984; Herat and its surrounding
 villages were bombed repeatedly, as were dozens of other
 localities around the country.
 In the countryside, it has become standard Soviet practice to
 bombard or even level whole villages suspected of harboring
 resistance fighters. Sometimes old men, women, and children
 are rounded up and shot. This devastation of towns and
 villages has forced many civilians to seek refuge in Kabul
 whose prewar population of less tnan 1 million has now swelled
 to nearly 2 million. More arrive with each new Soviet
 offensive.
 In addition, well over 3 million Afghans have become external
 refugees because of regime/Soviet military action and their
 opposition to regime oppression. In large areas of the
 countryside where the mujahidin are in virtual control,
 wartime conditions and animosities among competing resistance
 groups have resulted in a further trampling of human rights.
 Multiple taxation, arbitrary detention, and banditry prevail
 intermittently in some areas. Prospects for an improvement of
 the human rights situation appear bleak.
 After five years of warfare against the bulk of the country's
 population and following repeated calls for withdrawal by the
 U.N. General Assembly and regional organizations, the Soviets
 have shown no intention of withdrawing their soldiers, seeking
 a political settlement, or reducing their influence. Nor have
 the mujahidin and the Afghan people shown signs of any
 inclination to quit the struggle.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section I Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 Arbitrary killings and other acts of violence by Soviet troops
 continued to be reported throughout 1984. In May, Soviet
 soldiers in a jeep machine-gunned a group of Afghans waiting
 at a bus stop in Kabul, killing and wounding several
 bystanders. Reportedly, the Soviets had been drinking and
 were acting in retaliation for an attack on a Soviet vehicle
 in the same neighborhood. Travelers from Kandahar have grown
 increasingly fearful of the trip overland because of the
 possibility of Soviet air strikes against civilian buses on
 
 
 1161
 AFGHANISTAN
 the Kandahar-Kabul highway. There have been numerous reports
 of similar individual, or mass, revenge killings of Afghan
 villagers by Soviet troops. As one example, a credible report
 described the August killing of 29 women, children, and
 elderly persons at a small village near Kama east of Jalalabad
 in revenge for a mujahidin attack on a Soviet outpost in the
 vicinity the day before.
 Summary executions of captured mujahidin on the battlefield
 are common. In late October, Soviet officers reportedly
 ordered the execution of 450 mujahidin who surrendered when
 their ammunition ran out. Despite the fact that fighting
 against the Soviets and the regime is a daily occurrence
 throughout the country, there are no known prisoner-of-war
 camps for resistance fighters. Regime propaganda seldom
 mentions the capture of resistance fighters but makes frequent
 references to their *elimination.' Reports continue to
 circulate that resistance forces nave also killed captured
 Afghan and Soviet soldiers. Though some prisoners in Afghan
 jails have been killed, there is less direct evidence of such
 executions in 1984 than in past years. However, the general
 pattern remains: according to one report, 12 members of a
 single family were summarily executed in the Pul-e Charkhi
 Prison last year.
 The Soviets continue to employ particularly cruel types of
 anti-personnel explosives in an effort to restrict the
 movement of resistance forces. Butterfly mines and other
 explosive devices disguised as household objects or toys have
 been strewn along trails and paths in the southwest and
 eastern regions of the country. Many Afghans assert that the
 relatively large number of leg and foot injuries seen on
 Kabul's streets and in Peshawar's hospitals result from such
 explosive devices.
 Assassination by mujahidin of Afghan Communist party members,
 suspected police agents and informants, and Soviets in Afghan
 cities is a common occurrence. The resistance also has
 continued sporadic acts of urban terrorism. Several
 restaurants and bars frequented by the secret police have been
 bombed, as was Kabul's airport with heavy loss of life in
 August. Innocent bystanders have also been killed or
 injured. Random rocket or mortar attacks on Kabul (and other
 cities) by resistance forces have also resulted in loss of
 life.
 Evidence indicates that Soviet and Afghan forces have used
 lethal chemical and toxin weapons. Reports of chemical and
 toxin agents used include mycotoxins (poisons derived from
 natural biological sources), nerve gases, incapacitants,
 blister agents, carbon monoxide, and nonlethal gases delivered
 by a variety of means. Although there have been no confirmed
 incidents since 1982, there were continuing reports in 1984
 that chemical agents are still being used.
 b. Disappearance
 Under the previous Communist regimes of Nur Mohammad Taraki
 and Hafizullah Amin, persons frequently disappeared and were
 never heard from again. Under the Babrak Karmal regime,
 families, as a rule, eventually find out when missing
 relatives have been swept up in the continuing dragnets for
 military conscripts or have been detained by the secret
 police, often without formal charges.
 
 
 1162
 AFGHANISTAN
 There continued to be reports of abductions of Khad members by
 the resistance. In almost all cases, those abducted are
 reported to have been murdered or detained for lengthy periods.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Torture and physical intimidation remain among the main
 techniques used by the security services to extract
 information or confessions from detainees and to inflict
 punishment. Survivors of Afghan prisons continue to recount
 tales consistent with a generalized pattern of torture,
 involving electric shock, beatings, extraction of fingernails,
 and burning of genitalia.
 One man reported having been arrested and held for three
 months after being shot in a cross-fire between DRA soldiers
 and resistance fighters. During his incarceration, he was
 repeatedly subjected to electric shocks in an effort to coerce
 a "confession.' Another person arrested in Kandahar and held
 over two months on charges he had worked for foreigners before
 the "revolution' related that electric shock was commonly used
 on him and on other prisoners suspected of political crimes.
 In another instance, in late October regime troops and Khad
 members reportedly dragged children from their homes and held
 them under water in an effort to extort information and
 confessions from their terrified parents during a series of
 house-to-house searches near Kabul.
 All Afghan governments, including those prior to the 1978
 Communist coup, have probably treated some prisoners
 brutally. Only since 1978, however, has the use of torture
 become widespread and systematic. This trend has been
 accompanied by increasing reports from former inmates,
 detainees, and prisoners of the presence of Soviet *advisers'
 at such interrogation sessions. While these advisers
 apparently do not actually take part in torture, they make no
 attempt to halt it and their presence strongly suggests Soviet
 approval. Credible reports also indicate that Soviet guards
 have replaced Afghans at Kabul's notorious Pul-e Charkhi
 Prison.
 In its report Torture in the Eighties, Amnesty International
 noted that it had received reports of the torture and
 ill-treatment of people taken into custody by Afghan military
 personnel, and more especially by Rhad, the secret police;
 that prisoners are alleged to have been subjected to beatings,
 deprivation of sleep, and electric shock torture; and that
 prisoners which it had interviewed, and other reports which it
 had received, indicate widespread torture in as many as eight
 Khad interrogation centers in Kabul.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Afghans in areas controlled by the regime live in constant
 fear of arbitrary arrest or detention by the secret police.
 Even President Karmal has criticized his security forces for
 arbitrary abuses. Persons are often picked up for questioning
 on the word of Khad informants and are not told of the charges
 against them. Warrants are not used. Most political
 prisoners are charged with crimes such as treason, espionage,
 or terrorism. Formal charges are usually brought only after
 months of interrogation, if ever. In cases where the regime
 
 
 1163
 AFGHANISTAN
 wishes to demonstrate to the public its effectiveness in
 apprehending its opponents (e.g., the August 31 Kabul airport
 bombing), the security organs can rapidly produce as many
 'suspects' as needed. In such instances, there is generally a
 publicly televised recantation followed often by a 'public'
 show trial and swift execution. In other instances,
 unfortunate victims may be rounded up in house-to-house
 searches, imprisoned, and virtually forgotten by the
 authorities. Political crimes range from armed opposition to
 authorship or distribution of leaflets against the regime or
 the Soviet occupation, but the definition may be tailored to
 fit any opponent of the regime.
 Bail is not a feature of Afghan law. However, in cases of
 common crimes involving wealthy persons or persons with good
 connections with the regime, bail is sometimes granted.
 Corruption is widespread and it is possible for the families
 of those detained for common crimes to have them released
 after bribes are paid to secret police agents or members of
 the regime.
 Afghan regime sweeps for army conscripts and illegal retention
 of soldiers beyond their term of service also regularly occur
 and constitute detention on arbitrary grounds. As a result of
 recruiting problems and the high rate of desertions, in 1983
 the regime began to retain reservists beyond their legal
 release date. Revised draft laws further reduced exemptions
 and led to the recall of others who had completed their
 military service. The regime continued to use house-to-house
 searches and press gangs in the bazaars and markets of the
 major cities to obtain conscripts, often seizing those with no
 legal liability to service.
 In areas not controlled by the regime, Soviet or Afghan
 soldiers or suspected secret police agents are dealt with in
 various ways. Suspected Khad agents are either killed or
 detained after an informal mujahidin inquiry. Regime soldiers
 are often considered fellow Muslims and are instructed to
 return to their villages. Soviet soldiers are sometimes
 killed out of hand. In many cases, such as in the Panjsher
 Valley, they are kept under detention, while others have been
 transported to safekeeping across the border. Prisoners held
 by the mujahidin reportedly face harsh conditions. However,
 the ratio of known Soviet soldiers in captivity to the number
 of Soviets reportedly captured appears low, suggesting that
 many Soviets are summarily executed. Under a 1982 agreement,
 the mujahidin have delivered to the International Committee of
 the Red Cross 11 Soviet prisoners-of-war to serve a 2 year
 internment in Switzerland before repatriation to the U.S.S.R.
 As of December 31, seven had been released, one had escaped,
 and three remained interned.
 e. Denial of Pair Public Trial
 All courts, whether civil, military, "revolutionary* or
 security, are controlled by the Peoples' Democratic Party of
 Afghanistan, and laws governing their organization and
 jurisdiction set out as the first priority the safeguarding of
 the gains of the 'revolution." One consequence is that
 plaintiffs may be denied judicial process because of charges
 regarding their political beliefs or social position. Most of
 those accused of non-political offenses are apparently tried
 in the civil court system under the norms of pre-Communist
 judicial codes. However, political prisoners are often
 
 
 1164
 AFGHANISTAN
 imprisoned for months without trial or formal proceedings and
 are tried and sentenced in secret with Khad playing the major
 role. They are not allowed lawyers and seldom are able to
 question hostile witnesses. On the rare occasions when
 foreigners are accused of political crimes, they are denied
 defense counsel of their own choice and are not allowed to
 question regime witnesses, whose testimony is invariably
 accepted as fact by the court.
 During 1984, the regime continued to stage public 'show
 trials' of political opponents. It was clear well before the
 trials" that guilt and sentencing were foregone conclusions.
 Press accounts repeatedly used formulations such as 'the
 suspects will be tried and sentenced," indicating the sham
 nature of the *trials.' In most cases, the penalty was death,
 although occasionally (for example, in the case of one young
 man allegedly involved in the August Kabul airport bombing)
 lengthy prison sentences were substituted. Death penalties
 generally are carried out quickly after only a pro forma
 review without appeal by the ruling revolutionary council.
 In areas not controlled by the regime, civil and criminal
 cases are apparently tried by Islamic *qazis' (judges) under
 traditional Shari'a law and Afghan custom. The imposition of
 such sentences as death, stoning, or mutilation is reportedly
 rare. There are also some mujahidin courts for trying Soviet
 and regime soldiers or suspected regime agents. Little is
 known of these bodies, although they are believed to be based
 on Islamic jurisprudence.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Afghan regime and the Soviet occupation forces do not
 recognize the right to an undisturbed private sphere of
 activity. This fundamental political axiom is reinforced by
 wartime conditions. In the cities and during operations
 against villages, areas are frequently cordoned off and
 subjected to house-to-house searches for military conscripts,
 :ujahidin fighters, and weapons. Members of the secret police
 commonly accompany the military and read book titles and
 correspondence for evidence of unorthodox opinion or
 connections. House-to-house searches in Kabul are often
 conducted in the early morning before daybreak.
 Rights to privacy and freedom from arbitrary interference vary
 widely in areas controlled by local mujahidin leaders and are
 no doubt influenced by military needs. The Afghan resistance
 has generally tried not to antagonize the civilian population
 by arbitrary demands for shelter or supplies, but there are
 always exceptions, and growing suspicion caused by the
 increased use of informers and agents can only compound an
 already difficult situation.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 There is no freedom of speech or press in those areas within
 reach of the regime. All media are owned and controlled by
 the regime and tightly supervised by Soviet officials. The
 press, radio, and television are used solely to convey regime
 policy and the Soviet interpretation of world events. Soviet
 films and entertainment programs are frequently featured on
 
 
 1165
 AFGHANISTAN
 Afghan television to reinforce that interpretation. Since
 mid-1982, the regime has forbidden the unlicensed import and
 sale of foreign video and audio tapes, magazines, books,
 posters, and other publications. The great majority of new
 books on sale in Kabul, irrespective of language, are
 published in the U.S.S.R. Afghans are guarded in their
 private conversations, even among friends or colleagues, lest
 anti-regime or anti-Soviet remarks be reported to the secret
 police. Western radio broadcasts in the local languages are
 regularly jammed although some programs do get through to
 Afghan listeners and constitute one of their main sources of
 information. The regime has hampered the efforts of
 non-Communist news media to cover the war inside Afghanistan
 and has imprisoned or expelled foreign correspondents captured
 while accompanying the mujahidin. Soviet and regime spokesmen
 have threatened any further foreign journalists with capture
 or death.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 There is no freedom of peaceful assembly or association in
 those areas controlled by the regime; the regime only permits
 assemblies which are regime-sponsored and orchestrated. The
 regime frequently stages *spontaneous' meetings in the capital
 and provinces to create the impression of popular support.
 Demonstrations at Western embassies similarly can be arranged
 on demand. All organizations are tightly controlled by the
 regime. Trade associations and unions of workers and of
 peasants are closely modeled after those in the U.S.S.R. and
 serve as vehicles for the further politicization, and
 Sovietization, of Afghan society. Religious organizations are
 similarly supervised and monitored.
 Employees have been threatened with loss of jobs or
 imprisonment if they refuse to join party organizations. In
 some cases, families are warned that their children will be
 forced out of school if they do not join one of the youth
 organizations. This campaign to restrict and channel
 political and social activities has led to a further exodus by
 Afghanistan's already shrunken upper and middle classes.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Afghanistan has for centuries been an overwhelmingly Islamic
 (Sunni) nation, though small Hindu, Sikh, and Jewish enclaves
 of foreign origin have traditionally been tolerated. The
 former Communist regimes of Taraki and Amin were militantly
 secularist. As this orientation was a major factor in the
 armed resistance to these regimes' authority, the Babrak
 Karmal regime makes a great show of dedication to Islamic
 principles; the media portray regime figures as defenders of
 the faith and the resistance as destroyers of mosques; major
 regime policies are immediately given the imprimatur of the
 regime-controlled Council of Religious Figures. In areas
 under its control, the regime selects, censors, and pays the
 mullahs for individual mosques. Such clerics are considered
 to be secret police agents by many Afghans and have been
 frequent targets for assassination by the resistance. Despite
 such propaganda, the vast majority of the religious leadership
 and the people of Afghanistan consider the regime and its
 sponsors to be anathema, totally contrary to the tenets of
 Islam.
 
 
 1166
 AFGHANISTAN
 Conditions pertaining to freedom of religion vary widely in
 areas under mujahidin control. In those parts of Afghanistan
 under fundamentalist leadership there tends to be greater
 Islamic orthodoxy, while for regions under moderate leadership
 greater diversity is allowed.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Domestic travel has been severely curtailed by the war.
 Overland movement has become more difficult because of
 physical damage to roadbeds and destruction of bridges.
 Surface travelers also risk being caught in fights between
 mujahidin and Soviet forces. The civilian traveler is faced
 with frequent checkpoints or roadblocks by Soviets, regime
 forces, mujahidin, and, in some cases, bandits. Tolls are
 often extracted. Regime officials ordinarily travel by air,
 since they risk being identified and killed by the mujahidin.
 Air travel has become more dangerous because of occasional
 resistance attacks on aircraft and airports. Such an attack
 occurred in September 1984, when a projectile fired by a
 mujahidin group hit an Ariana Afghan Airlines DC-10 about 20
 kilometers from Kabul.
 The regime severely curtails foreign travel by Afghans under
 its control. Permission for travel to the West by
 professionals is routinely denied out of fear they will not
 return. Some businessmen can still obtain passports, but many
 Afghans are forced to pay bribes of $1,000 or more for a
 passport. Bank accounts and real estate are often asked as
 surety for return, and the regime seizes the property of
 persons absent from Afghanistan for more than a year.
 Passports are generally limited to one trip only and are
 seized at the airport upon return. Afghan pilgrims to Mecca
 are carefully screened and are issued documents valid only for
 Saudi Arabia in an effort to assure return to Afghanistan.
 While legal emigration is virtually impossible, large numbers
 continue to leave clandestinely to seek refuge abroad. The
 regime has seized entire families who presented insufficient
 justification for traveling on routes commonly used to leave
 the country surreptitiously. Most estimates place the number
 who have fled the country at over 3 million. The regime has
 often asserted that exiles are welcome to return without
 penalty; however, most expatriate Afghans remain deeply
 suspicious of the regime's intentions and have not returned.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Since the Soviet invasion, a repressive one-party state ruled
 by the People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan has given way
 to a totalitarian apparatus directly controlled by the Soviet
 Union. In fact, however, the regime and Soviets exert control
 over only a few major cities; in many cities, such as Herat
 and Kandahar, this control is limited and is challenged
 frequently by armed resistance attacks. Most of the
 countryside is, for practical purposes, not under regime
 control. Soviet militaryand civilian advisers sit in almost
 all ministries and make or approve every significant
 decision. The party itself is modeled along Soviet lines and
 is headed by a 12-member politburo. The party is torn by
 feuding between its Parcham and Khalq factions. The less
 numerous Parcham faction, presently favored by Moscow, retains
 
 
 1167
 AFGHANISTAN
 control of the party apparatus. Political assassinations in
 Kabul are often suspected to be the work of rival factions
 rather than of the mujahidin. Regime figures put party
 membership at 120,000 (including candidate members) although
 active membership is much lower. Membership in the People's
 Democratic Party of Afghanistan, the only legal political
 party, is a prerequisite for meaningful participation in
 public affairs and professional advancement in many fields.
 There has been no legislature or election since the 1978
 Communist coup, and the regime rules by edict.
 Local mujahidin groups control political, judicial, and
 educational activities in roughly three-quarters of the
 country. In some areas, resistance leaders are traditional
 local leaders, in others younger military organizers. Since
 this leadership is in defiance of the formal government
 apparatus, the authority of such leaders necessarily depends
 on some form of informal popular consent, often approval by
 the traditional local "jirga" or council.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 No international non-governmental organizations are permitted
 to operate in Afghanistan. The International Committee of the
 Red Cross has not been allowed in Kabul since 1982.
 In its 1984 report, Amnesty International expressed concern
 about the imprisonment of prisoners of conscience, detention
 of political prisoners without charge or trial, torture and
 ill-treatment of detainees, the use of the death penalty,
 reported extrajudicial executions, and the fact that the few
 trials of political prisoners it had learned of appeared to
 fall far short of international standards. Freedom House
 calls Afghanistan *not free.*
 In December the Helsinki Watch, a group founded to promote
 compliance with the human rights provisions of the 1975
 Helsinki agreement, issued a 212-page report on human rights
 violations in Afghanistan since the Soviet intervention in
 1979. The report states that it soon became clear from
 interviews with Afghan refugees that 'just about every
 conceivable human rights violation is occurring in Afghanistan
 and on an enormous scale.'
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 Although there are no reliable current demographic statistics,
 standards of nutrition and health care have clearly declined
 since the 1978 Communist coup and the 1979 Soviet invasion,
 especially outside the major cities. The war has disrupted
 the international marketing system, caused the devaluation of
 the currency, and interrupted the movement of surplus
 agricultural products from one region to another. The Soviets
 have destroyed crops and livestock in certain regions such as
 the Shomali north of Kabul, the Logar Valley, and the Panjsher
 Valley. The result has been the creation of areas with
 inadequate food supplies and occasional pockets of severe food
 shortages. Food imported from the U.S.S.R. is distributed
 chiefly in the few cities under regime control.
 
 
 1168
 AFGHANISTAN
 According to World Bank statistics, the population of
 14,448,000 is growing at an annual rate of 2.4 percent. Given
 the large number of casualties among the civilian population,
 life expectancy has declined to 37 years and the infant
 mortality rate is 181.6 per 1,000 live births. Although rural
 health delivery services have never been adequate, at present
 they are nonexistent except for folk medicine, a limited
 number of Afghan paramedics who are usually only semiskilled
 and serve in mujahidin-controlled areas, and those services
 provided by foreign doctors who have entered the country
 clandestinely. Medical services provided in urban areas under
 regime control are also inadequate because of the influx of
 rural people driven from their villages by military action,
 war-related casualties, an overall shortage of doctors and
 qualified staff, and a severe lack of medicines, equipment,
 and even sheets and beds.
 The war also has had a drastic impact on education. Most
 rural schools were destroyed by the resistance when the regime
 attempted to turn them into political indoctrination centers.
 Many others have been closed because of the danger to regime
 teachers. Formal education even in major cities, such as
 Kandahar, has been brought to a virtual standstill as a result
 of daily fire fights. In most rural areas, education seems to
 be in the hands of traditional Islamic teachers. The regime's
 inability to maintain the strength of its armed forces has led
 to the drafting of boys as young as 15 (16 is the official age
 limit), and attendance at Kabul University has been limited to
 women, party members, and men who have completed military
 service. In secure urban areas, schools for girls and boys
 are functioning, with curricula reoriented to conform to the
 Soviet model. The regime has initiated a literacy program in
 the military forces using ideological tracts as texts.
 Each year several thousand young Afghans are sent to the
 Soviet Union for training heavily geared to political
 indoctrination. In 1984, at least 3,000 young teenagers were
 sent to various Soviet Central Asian republics for *summer
 vacation.* And over 300 children between 7 and 10 years old
 were reported by Afghan medics to have been sent to the
 U.S.S.R. for over 10 years total education.
 Though party members, secret police, regime figures, and some
 merchants may have been enriched by the war, most Afghans have
 suffered economically. Except for regime-subsidized wheat
 products, the cost of many food items and housing has risen
 faster than personal income. Heating fuel costs have become
 exorbitant. Although electricity is relatively inexpensive,
 it is frequently unavailable in the winter. Because of severe
 fuel shortages followed by wartime destruction of power lines
 into Kabul, electricity during 1984 was generally unavailable
 between August and November. Difficulties with surface travel
 and repeated bombings of formerly rich agricultural and
 pastoral areas such as the Shomali and the Northern Steppe
 have led to a decrease in traditional Afghan cash crops and
 exports such as grapes, dried fruit, and karakul lambskins.
 Production of traditional handcraft items for export, such as
 carpets, has also been severely impeded by the war, and the
 once thriving tourism industry has completely vanished.
 Participation of Afghan women in activities beyond home and
 field is severely limited by traditional beliefs, customs, and
 religious practices. In areas of intense fighting and
 mujahidin control, the role of women remains much as it
 
 
 1169
 AFGHANISTAN
 tradionally has been. Since the Soviet installation of the
 Babrak Karmal regime, the social position of individual women
 has tended to improve in Kabul and other cities controlled by
 the regime. Access to education by younger women has
 increased and the media have put much emphasis on literacy
 courses for females. In an attempt to attract more women to
 the regime's banner and to fill the gap caused by males in the
 army or fighting for the resistance, women have been placed in
 a number of non-traditional professions such as radio and
 television, banking, and the civil service. Few women,
 however, aside from one politburo member, have anything
 approaching a decisionmaking position. The vast majority of
 women under regime control have seen no improvement in their
