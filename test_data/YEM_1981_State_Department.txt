 THE PEOPLE'S DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF YEMEN*
 
 The People's Democratic Republic of Yemen (PDRY or South
 Yemen), is a one-party state, dominated by a Marxist
 political party dedicated to restructuring the economic
 and social order. The ruling Yemen Socialist Party
 derives from the National Liberation Front which came to
 power with independence in 1967, following protracted
 civil conflict with competing nationalist/revolutionary
 groups. The current president, Ali Nasser Mohammad, came
 to office in mid-1979 upon the resignation of his
 predecessor, Ahmed Al-Fatah Ismail. Ismail had gained
 office in 1978 after winning a power struggle within the
 ruling party. 'The president before him, Salim Rubay'i
 Ali, was executed. The Yemen Socialist Party hierarchy
 comprises the governing elite. Policy questions are
 decided by a small group of party and government
 officials. Officials losing power struggles have been
 executed, placed under house arrest, or forced into
 political and social obscurity.
 South Yemeni society in recent years has experienced
 profound and traumatic changes. Since independence,
 Aden's leaders have sought to eliminate the traditional
 tribal forces and to subject tribal groups to party and
 central government control. As a result, entire classes,
 such as traditional tribal leadership and religious
 elements and the private business community, have
 virtually disappeared from the society.
 Settlement of the bedouin is a major government effort.
 The government has also sought to limit the influence of
 the mercantile community in Aden. As a result of these
 efforts to restructure traditional society, large numbers
 of South Yemenis, perhaps 300,000 - 500,000 (15%-20% of
 the population), have left the country.
 The PDRY supports terrorism. It has in the past given
 aslyum to aircraft hijackers, and allows its territory to
 be used by several groups for the training of
 international terrorists. The National Democratic Front,
 a North Yemeni insurgent group, is conducting a violent
 conflict with the government forces of the Yemen Arab
 Republic (North Yemen) out of sanctuaries in the PDRY,
 with the knowledge, support and encouragement of the Aden
 government. During the 1970s, similar groups based in
 the PDRY conducted an insurgency in Oman.
 South Yemen's constitution purports to guarantee a wide
 range of human rights. In practice, South Yemen is a
 tightly controlled state in which the rights of
 individuals are subordinated to the economic and political
 interests of the ruling party and state.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 *The United States maintains no diplomatic mission in
 Aden. The People's Democratic Republic of Yemen severed
 diplomatic relations and expelled all United States
 personnel in 1969. In view of the closed nature of the
 regime and the lack of an American presence there, it is
 difficult to obtain information on the human rights
 situation.

 a. Torture
 Although the constitution prohibits torture, there have
 been reports that torture is practiced. These have been
 denied by the government. In 1978, Amnesty International
 stated that prisoners were subject to "brutal torture,
 known in some cases to have resulted in paralysis or even
 death."
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 Prison conditions in South Yemen are reported to be poor,
 with inadequate sanitary facilities, monotonous and meager
 rations, and harsh treatment. In 1978, Amnesty
 International expressed concern over prison conditions in
 the PDRY, including serious deficiencies in hygiene, food,
 health care and the overall treatment of prisoners. In
 addition to torture, AI reported "frequent and arbitrary
 harassment of prisoners by prison guards."
 c. Disappearances
 In addition to trials and jailing of thousands of
 political opponents and the flight into exile of hundreds
 of thousands, many opponents of the regime disappeared.
 In 1977, Amnesty International investigated reports of ten
 people who had disappeared and were believed dead. The
 1981 Amnesty International Report states that, according
 to reports, hundreds of people have disappeared since
 independence in 1967 and some have disappeared from
 prisons where they had been receiving regular visits from
 their families. Freedom House also reports hundreds of
 disappearances.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 Individuals are reportedly thoroughly investigated prior
 to arrest, and arrest and detention practices follow legal
 requirements. No information is available regarding how
 arbitrary the definition of a crime might be. Amnesty
 International has reported the cases of members of the
 pre-independence federal government imprisoned without
 charge or trial since 1967, as well as of other political
 prisoners similarly detained since 1970-75. The last
 available estimate (1976) was that there might be as many
 as 10,000 political prisoners in South Yemen, but no
 current statistics are available.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 No reliable information is available, but the Freedom
 House 1981 survey noted that people's courts had handed
 down death sentences against protesting farmers.
 f. Invasion of the Home
 The constitution guarantees the sanctity of the home,
 except in connection with "actions affecting the security
 of the revolution and in accordance with the law." There
 have been no reports of violations of traditional mores
 which insure the privacy and integrity of the home from
 forceful entry.
 According to reports, international mail and telephone
 communications and the communications of suspect
 individuals are monitored on occasion.

 2. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, including%
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 Yemenis are traditionally very open in their views, and
 have been known to discuss political issues with
 foreigners with great candor when privacy is assured.
 However, PDRY law requires that anti-regime and anti-party
 statements be reported, and a widespread informant system
 reportedly exists, placing a severe constraint on the
 exercise of free speech.
 Freedom of the press is purportedly guaranteed by law.
 However, the public media is state-owned and operated, and
 all newspaper and magazine articles reportedly must be
 approved by the appropriate editorial staff. Foreign
 publications are known to circulate freely, once they have
 been unofficially introduced into the country. Those
 foreign newspapers and magazines normally sold within the
 PDRY are known to have been censored occasionally.
 The constitution declares Islam to be the state religion,
 but guarantees freedom of religious expression. In
 practice, the government has attempted to minimize the
 influence of religious leaders.
 h. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration and Repatriation
 The government controls departures from Yemen. Exit
 permits are required and are not freely provided. PDRY
 citizens are free to travel within their province of
 residence without restriction, and, except for some
 restricted security areas, without special documentation
 among the other provinces.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 The constitution guarantees the right to vote to males and
 females over the age of eighteen. The Yemen Socialist
 Party, dominated by a marxist cadre, is the only legal
 political party. All others are prohibited by law, and
 only YSP-approved candidates can contest elections.
 Decisions are made at the highest levels of the party
 organization, where personality and faction play a major
 role in decision making. The losers in factional
 struggles for power have sometimes suffered exile or
 execution.
 3. Government Attitude and Record Regarding International
 and Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Amnesty International delegates were last permitted to
 visit a prison in 1975. South Yemen has not replied to
 repeated requests from Amnesty International for
 information about prisoners. The regional delegate of the
 International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) carried
 out a mission to the PDRY in February-March, 1981. In
 addition to meeting with senior government officials, the
 ICRC delegate was allowed to interview some 400 detainees,
 7 of whom were charged with political offenses. Four of
 these interviews were conducted without witnesses.

 4. Economic and Social Circumstances
 The PDRY has a population of 1.9 million, with a per
 capita income estimated at $480 in 1979. Almost
 one-fourth of the population lives in the area of Aden,
 about 150,000 are nomadic bedouin, and the rest are
 -scattered in the rural areas. It is estimated that about
 150,000 men work in the oil-producing states of the Gulf
 and.Saudi Arabial and-their remittances constitute a
 crucial.source of foreign exchange. About 40% of the
 labor force is employed in agriculture, which produces
 12.6% of the Gross Domestic Product.
 Life expectancy at birth was 45 years in 1970, up from 36
 years in 1960. Between 1970 and 1979, the rate of
 population growth was 2.3%, compared to 1.9% in the
 previous decade.
 Education and. health care are free and the government has
 .made a major effort to increase the literacy rate.
 Western visitors have.been impressed by the number and
 .appearance of school children visible on the streets of
 Aden. Current. estimates place 72% of school-age children
 in primary school.. The government requires illiterate
 adults to attend.literacy classes. The number of
 hospitals has increased dramatically since independence,
 and there are social welfare centers. Equality of both
 sexes is guaranteed by law. Western visitors report
 seeing numerous women actively engaged in the labor
 force. ...Polygamy, child marriage and arranged marriage are
 prohibited.
 Poverty is widespread, and there are frequent food
 .shortages in South Yemen. Because of severe financial
 constraints, only a small percentage of the budget is
 devoted to domestic development, current accounts
 constitute the bulk of government spending. South Yemen
 has acquired large amounts of Soviet military equipment in
 .recent. years, but. the terms of payment and .the consequent
 impact on other sectors of the .economy is unknown.
 Housing is in particularly short supply in Aden. It is
 almost impossible for single persons to obtain housing.
 Living space is rationed according to the size of the
 family unit. Western visitors.have remarked on the
 existence of "shanty towns' on the outskirts of the city.
 New housing developments are presently under construction
 by Western contractors in Aden. Housing applications are
 initiated through the basic level of organization of the
 ..Yemeni Socialist Party. All furnishings must be rented
 through the state.
 ...Basic food items which are in short supply, such as rice,
  sugar.and cooking oil, are rationed. Recent estimates
 indicate that the caloric intake declined from 91% of
 normal nutritional requirements in 1970 to 81% in 1978.
 Reports indicate that there is little, private business.
 .The government.has recently moved to attract PDRY
 .nationals living abroad to return by expanding private
 business opportunity. Western visitors have reported that
 much of the local retail trade is carried out by small,
 regulated private businesses, although other reports
 suggest that these conduct only a small percentage of this
 trade.
