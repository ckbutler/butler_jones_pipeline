 CANADA
 
 Canada in 1978 again demonstrated its clear commitment
 to human rights. Parliament, the press and the public
 are quick to react to any real or suspected infringe-
 ment of human rights, not only in Canada but elsewhere
 in the world. Canada is a staunch supporter of United
 Nations resolutions and declarations concerning human
 rights and has accepted large numbers of refugees.
 The 1977 Canadian Human Rights Act provided for a Federal
 Human Rights Commission which combats discrimination by
 ensuring that, at the federal level, all public agencies
 and crown corporations provide equal employment oppor-
 tunity and eliminate discrimination based on race, creed,
 country of national origin, sex or pardoned criminal
 record.
 In June 1978, Prime Minister Trudeau presented to Parlia-
 ment a landmark draft bill proposing major changes in
 the Canadian Constitution that would strengthen human
 freedoms and reform the upper House of Parliament and
 the Canadian Supreme Court. The proposed "Charter of
 Rights and Freedoms" would add comprehensive statements
 of political and legal rights and freedoms to Canada's
 Constitution. It would also guarantee rights regarding
 the use of English and French languages, freedom of
 conscience and thought, and protection against unreason-
 able searches and seizures and the retroactive applica-
 tion of criminal sanctions. The bill is currently the
 subject of public and Parliamentary debate.

 2. Governmental Policies Relating to the Fulfillment
 of Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care
 and Education
 The Canadian Government has demonstrated a strong commit-
 ment to improving the lot of the poor. The federal
 and provincial governments participate in social welfare
 programs. All Canadians are covered by a national med-
 ical and health insurance program. There is a compre-
 hensive and generous program of unemployment insurance
 compensation administered by the federal Department of
 Employment and Immigration. About 2.1 million Canadians
 over 65 receive old-age security payments. Federal and
 provincial tax systems are progressive. Canadian labor
 unions in both the public and private sectors enjoy wide
 freedom of action.
 While there have been individual abuses for which members
 of Parliament and civil servants have been indicted, the
 governmental system of Canada is almost entirely free
 from corruption. Canadian law enforcement agencies enjoy
 a high regard and the attitude of Canadians toward them
 is supportive.
 
 
 3. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Inclu-
 ding:
 a. Freedom of Thought, Speech, Press, Religion
 and Assembly
 These freedoms are guaranteed by law and respected in
 practice.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country,
 Foreign Travel and Emigration
 Laws guarantee freedom of internal movement within the
 country, foreign travel and emigration.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political
 Process
 Canada is a constitutional monarchy with a parliamentary
 form of government and a strong democratic tradition.
 Elections are orderly and governments are stable.
 The status of French Canadians within the confederation
 is a matter of serious national concern. Historical
 factors have limited the range of political and eco-
 nomic opportunities open to the cultural and linguistic
 minority of francophone Canadians but the Canadian
 Government is deeply committed to ensuring the full
 realization of equal opportunity for all ethnic groups
 within the country. The Government has made extensive
 efforts to encourage a positive public attitude toward
 minorities. Much emphasis has been placed on the
 fostering of a bilingual, multicultural society in
 which all may enjoy freedom from discrimination.
 Discrimination on the basis of sex is outlawed. A
 Cabinet Minister is specifically charged with responsi-
 bility for the status of women; A Federal Advisory
 Council on the Status of Women, consisting of thirty
 women with distinguished records in business, government
 and social service, advises the minister on wqomen's
 affairs and on measures to maintain sexual equality in
 legislative policy.

 4. Government Attitude and Record Regarding Inter-
 national and Non-governmental Investigation of
 Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 To the knowledge of the Department of State, Canada's
 human rights performance has prompted no outside re-
 quests for investigation.
