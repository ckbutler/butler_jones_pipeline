 ALGERIA
 Algeria is a Socialist, Islamic state in which power is vested
 in a single political party, the National Liberation Front
 (FLN). As party Chairman and Minister of Defense, President
 Chadli Bendjedid holds the key decisionmaking positions.
 Nonetheless, most important decisions are taken by a consensus
 of the military, government, and party elites, who share the
 common experience of their struggle for independence from
 France, won in 1962. Though a new generation of technocrats
 has begun to emerge, a sense of revolutionary, anticolonial
 mission remains basic to the ruling elite's perception of
 Algerian national goals.
 Internal security is maintained principally by the urban
 police and the gendarmerie, which generally adheres to
 constitutional guarantees against arbitrary arrest and
 imprisonment. They are supported by the military security
 forces, which have greater leeway to make arrests. The
 military security forces and the police were accused of
 widespread abuse and torture of detainees during riots which
 broke out in Algiers and several other cities in early
 October. The Government has undertaken an investigation into
 these charges.
 The Government is continuing its shift in emphasis from heavy
 industry to the development of agriculture, job creation,
 devolution of economic decisionmaking and the satisfaction of
 unmet social needs. It has been hampered in reaching these
 goals, however, by low oil prices, high population growth, and
 inflation.
 The October riots, in which destruction was extensive,
 apparently were the immediate result of popular frustration
 over basic commodities shortages and rising prices. When
 civilian police were unable to restore order after 2 days, the
 Government invoked martial law and used the army to quell the
 rioting. The Interior Minister reported that 159 people died,
 including 154 demonstrators and 5 police officers. Other
 accounts indicated the death toll may have been as high as
 800. The Justice Minister said 3,743 people had been held on
 charges related to the riots, but the Government released a
 number of these detainees shortly after the unrest, and on
 November 1 President Bendjedid granted provisional liberty to
 those still in custody. As of the end of 1988, those already
 tried and convicted on riot-related charges reportedly were
 freed pending appeal of their cases, although there has been
 no indication of when the courts would take up the appeals.
 Following the disturbances, President Bendjedid declared his
 intention to expand public participation in political life.
 He held a referendum on November 3 on a proposal which to some
 extent reduced party dominance by making the Prime Minister
 answerable to the National Assembly rather than to the
 President, as in the past. The Government also announced
 additional changes, including reform of the FLN, which were
 endorsed at the November 27-28 FLN party congress and later
 will be submitted to another referendum. The party reforms
 allow non-FLN candidates to run in local, provincial, and
 national assemblies elections and grant some autonomy to FLN
 "mass organizations." The FLN congress also endorsed
 President Bendjedid's nomination for a third presidential
 term, and he was reelected December 22 in a referendum-style
 election in which he ran unopposed.

 ALGERIA
 Although the Algerian Human Rights League (ALHR) lobbied
 successfully for the release of almost all political prisoners,
 civil liberties remained restricted in 1988. The principal
 human rights concerns were the large number of deaths and
 injuries which resulted from the use of military force to
 quell the October riots, and reports that emerged late in the
 year of widespread torture employed by government forces
 during the disturbances. President Bendjedid met with ALHR
 representatives to review concerns resulting from the riots,
 and the Government has undertaken an investigation into torture
 allegations; thus far, no specific findings have been
 announced. Late in the year the ALHR criticized the
 Government's banning of an event focusing on the torture
 allegations.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There were no reports of deliberate political killings.
 However, as noted above, at least 159 persons were killed
 during the October riots when the military was called in to
 quell the disturbances.
 b. Disappearance
 Abductions, secret arrests, and clandestine detention are not
 known to be practiced. There were no reports of such practices
 in 1988.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Although the Constitution prohibits torture, there were a
 number of reports that torture was employed by the security
 forces on a wide scale during and after the October riots.
 The French-language weekly Algerie Actualite published
 accounts graphically describing the experiences of six
 reported torture victims, and the'ALHR released a report of
 its commission of inquiry into human rights abuses in which it
 found that there were 51 reported cases of torture out of 228
 reported cases of human rights violations which it had
 examined. The report stated that the methods of torture
 included beating, clubbing, knife wounds, electric shock,
 forcing detainees to crawl nude across glass and gravel,
 sexual violence, sodomization, burning with cigarettes, and
 forced swallowing of noxious liquids. According to the ALHR
 report, one of the victims died as a result of torture.
 In a speech to the FLN sixth party congress, President
 Bendjedid, reiterating his opposition to the use of torture,
 said he had instructed the Justice Ministry to investigate
 reports of torture. The Government also dismissed the chief
 of the military police that reportedly used torture, but as of
 year's end no charges relating to torture had been filed
 against security forces' personnel.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The Constitution states that no one may be held, arrested, or
 prosecuted except as provided by law. It also provides that
 detention for questioning in criminal investigation cases
 
 
 1279
 ALGERIA
 cannot exceed 48 hours, after which the suspect must be
 charged or released. This period may be extended to 4 days in
 ordinary criminal cases and to 8 days in state security cases.
 Detainees must be informed immediately of charges against
 them. Once charged, an individual may be held under preventive
 detention indefinitely while his case is being investigated.
 There are frequent charges of incommunicado detention of
 suspects, principally by the military security forces. There
 is no bail system. Lawyers are entitled to have access to
 their clients at any time. Meetings are supervised visually
 by a guard.
 Amnesty International (AI) has noted its concern about cases
 of prolonged incommunicado detention, and leaders of the ALHR
 declared in 1987 that elimination of this abuse as well as the
 practice of "administrative" or technical house arrest was
 their first priority. Although the League has been encouraged
 by President Bendjedid to promote respect for the law by all
 agencies of government, the ALHR did not forcefully pursue
 this sensitive issue during 1988. The League announced that
 it would issue a report on preventive detention in 1989.
 In October, prior to the riots, the Government reportedly
 rounded up labor activists associated with the outlawed
 Communist Parti L'avant Garde Socialiste (PAGS), believing
 they instigated strikes at major state enterprises around the
 country. Later, during the rioting, the Government announced
 the arrest of over 900 persons, reportedly including several
 hundred demonstrators caught in the act of rioting, and an
 unknown number of individuals, many o.f them university
 professors and leftists, detained because of their opposition
 political activities. Within 10 days after the rioting,
 however, the Government made public its intention to prosecute
 only those adult detainees who had been accused of criminal
 conduct during the disturbances and to release all other
 detainees. Most of those detainees were released soon after
 the announcement, and it appears that the rest have since been
 freed.
 Persons arrested for the expression of views critical of or
 different from those of the Government are generally charged
 with disturbing the public order, associating with illegal
 organizations, or, in extreme cases, threatening state
 security.
 Exile is not a legal form of punishment in Algeria. A number
 of opposition figures, notably former President Ben Bella,
 live abroad to escape arrest and trial.
 With regard to forced or compulsory labor, see Section 6.c.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The judicial system is divided into three parts: civil
 courts, military courts, and the State Security Court. There
 are no Islamic courts in Algeria. The civil courts are
 generally independent of executive or military control.
 Military courts deal directly with espionage and with offenses
 committed by military personnel. The State Security Court,
 located at Medea, is not in permanent session but has
 jurisdiction over cases that are deemed "to endanger the
 national security." At least a ministerial-level decision is
 required to refer a case to the State Security Court, which
 generally provides procedural protection similar to that of
 
 
 1280
 ALGERIA
 civilian courts. Interested observers are allowed to attend
 trials held in this court.
 Defendants in civil and security courts have free access to
 counsel, and there is no harassment of defense counsel. The
 Algerian Bar Association has a pool of lawyers who provide
 free services to defendants who cannot afford private counsel.
 As far as is known, defendants are made fully aware of the
 charges against them at the time they are bound over for
 trial. Defendants have the right to confront witnesses and
 present evidence. Trials are public, although not generally
 publicized, and defendants have the right to appeal.
 In the first days of October's civil unrest, the Government
 announced that persons arrested would be tried in "special
 tribunals" set up to handle speedily the large number of cases
 resulting from the riots. Within days, the special tribunal
 at Annaba had handed out heavy sentences to six detainees. In
 mid-October, however, after the ALHR had publicly condemned
 such tribunals, the Government announced that persons arrested
 during the riots would be tried in the regular court system,
 with full benefit of their right to a competent defense.
 Those sentenced in Annaba, like all others prosecuted on
 riot-related charges nationwide, have been released pending
 appeal under President Bendjedid's November 1 grant of
 provisional liberty.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Membership in political organizations is not required, except
 for senior government and military officials who are almost
 always members of the FLN party. An efficient police force,
 responsible for tracking possible sources of dissent, is
 believed to use informers. It is also believed that the
 police use telephone monitoring systems, rarely with prior
 court authorization.
 The Constitution provides for the inviolability of the home
 and it is generally respected, except in cases involving
 military security. Police may not enter a house without a
 warrant from the local prosecutor or investigating magistrate,
 and may not enter a residence during night hours.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Although the Constitution includes a provision for freedom of
 expression, it also states that such freedom may not be used
 to "undermine the foundations of the Socialist revolution."
 In practice, all print media are published either by the
 Government or the party, and all journqlists are government
 employees. The distribution of foreign newspapers and
 magazines is controlled.
 Some foreign publications are available only in small
 quantities. However, the French-language weekly Jeune Afrique
 is proscribed because it is seen as hostile to Algerian
 interests, and the French daily Le Monde is occasionally
 seized. Radio and television stations are government
 controlled. Before the October riots, the Government had not
 permitted criticism of its authority, the one-party system, or
 Algerian foreign policy. Criticism of specific domestic
 programs and policies, corruption and inefficiency in
 
 
 1281
 ALGERIA
 government, and even to some extent the Socialist system was
 allowed. Since the riots, however, the Government has allowed
 greater freedom of expression and permitted more criticism of
 Algerian political and economic institutions. Such criticism
 may appear on state-run television, in the weekly organ of the
 ruling FLN Party, Revolution Africaine, and in the weekly
 newspaper Algerie Actualite.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 All nongovernment associations must be approved by state
 authorities who have traditionally refused to recognize groups
 with political, economic, *or social views that differ from
 those of the FLN. In 1987, however, the Law on Associations
 was amended to permit most citizens' organizations to begin
 functioning without obtaining advance approval from the
 Interior Ministry. However, approval must be obtained by
 associations concerned with politically sensitive matters or
 matters in which foreigners are involyed. The ALHR set the
 precedent as the first important association allowed to exist
 outside the FLN structure and control; other new associations
 have begun to follow, for example, the Algerian Consumer
 Association and the Family Planning Association. Since the
 October riots a number of independent organizations of
 professional groups and others have formed to protest the
 authorities' use of torture during the unrest. These groups
 appear to be operating withouLofficial sanction and it is
 unclear whether they will be permitted to continue their
 activities.
 Mass organizations for youth, women, farmers, veterans, labor,
 and professional groups are all tightly controlled by the
 party and constitute the primary government-recognized
 associations. They are intended to play key political roles in
 mobilizing popular support for various government programs and
 elections and maintain relations with recognized international
 bodies in their fields. During its November 27-28 party
 congress, the FLN endorsed a.plan to grant some autonomy to
 these mass organizations by, for example, dropping the
 longstanding requirement that they be headed by FLN members.
 Although individuals are technically free to assemble,
 security personnel watch public gatherings closely. For a
 discussion of freedom of association as it applies to labor
 unions, see Section 6.a.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Legally an Islamic state, Algeria protects the rights of the
 very small Christian and Jewish populations to worship in
 their churches and synagogues. There is little evidence of
 individual prejudice. The Christian clergy directs its
 activities to the foreign community. The Islamic clergy is
 government trained. Friday mosque sermons are not formally
 censored, but government monitoring constrains the Islamic
 clergy's freedom of expression. However, flourishing mosque
 construction, largely financed by private donations, has
 exceeded the government's ability to provide trained imams and
 thereby to control proceedings at all the country's mosques.
 The yearly pilgrimage to Mecca is government organized.
 
 
 1282
 ALGERIA
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Freedom to travel within Algeria and abroad and to emigrate is
 provided for by law and generally is respected in practice.
 An exit visa is no longer required, but men who are 19 years
 of age or older must have proof of completion of mandatory
 2-year military service, and employees of state organizations
 who are paying back educational scholarships through work must
 have valid leave papers to exit the country. Passports
 sometimes take months to acquire, although this situation is
 improving. The amount of hard currency which Algerians may
 carry abroad (the equivalent of $200 once every 4 years) had
 been the primary limitation on foreign travel, and in late
 1988 the Government suspended even that meager allowance as
 part of stringent economic austerity measures imposed to cope
 with its rising international debt.
 Foreign diplomats must apply for permission to travel farther
 than 50 kilometers from Algiers. The 50-kilometer limit for
 diplomats is not strictly enforced, and permission to travel
 farther is quickly granted upon application. Travel within
 Algeria for other travelers is generally unrestricted, except
 in areas designated as "military zones." Visitors must
 register with the local police if they are staying overnight.
 Gendarmerie checkpoints in the countryside routinely inspect
 vehicle registrations and occasionally search vehicles.
 The Constitution provides for the right of political asylum.
 It is estimated that more than 100,000 refugees from the
 Western Sahara live in camps in southwestern Algeria. They
 are largely supported by the Government and, to a much lesser
 extent, by the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR).
 Algeria continues to provide refuge and support to an
 estimated 11,000-12,000 drought victims from Niger and Mali
 located in 4 camps near Tamanrasset. The Algerian Government
 continues to hold discussions with the Niger and Mali
 governments and with international organizations on the
 conditions for returning these remaining drought victims to
 their countries of origin, but little progress is evident.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Under Algeria's one-party system, citizens do not have the
 right to change their government, and civil liberties remain
 restricted. Political rights, in particular, have been
 circumscribed by the party and the Government, which have
 limited the electoral choices and restricted public debate to
 officially sanctioned forums and issues. During its November
 27-28 party congress, hgwever, the FLN endorsed a plan to
 allow non-FLN candidates to stand in local, provincial, and
 national assemblies elections.
 Major political decisions are made by the top leadership of
 the party, Government, and military, all three headed by
 President Bendjedid. The political process has been confined
 to the single party, which significantly limited deviation
 from the path prescribed by the ruling authorities. Basic
 policy decisions are not strictly questioned, but popular
 grievances are supposed to be aired within the party
 organization. Some diversity of views is also evident in the
 National Assembly, the provincial and local councils, and the
 government-controlled press. The National Assembly, whose
 members in the past have all been nominated to run for
 
 
 1283
 ALGERIA
 election by the FLN, has begun to assert itself in recent
 yearsby modifying in a conservative direction key aspects of
 government-sponsored reform legislation. Some very limited
 political opposition, such as student demonstrations, is
 tolerated. Opposition political tracts are sometimes
 circulated, almost certainly with official knowledge, but
 persons caught with them may be subject to arrest. More
 expression of criticism has been tolerated since the October
 disturbances.
 The October riots revealed limitations on the ability of the
 FLN to serve as the primary mechanism for interaction between
 the Government and the people. A negative public attitude
 toward the FLN evidenced by attacks on party and government
 installations in many localities led to efforts to reform the
 party.
 There is universal adult suffrage.  In past elections,
 candidates for public office were nominated by the party, but
 voters usually had a choice among two or more candidates.
 However, in presidential elections, there is only one
 candidate, nominated by the FLN congress. The November 27-28
 congress nominated President Bendjedid for a third term. He
 was subsequently reelectedon December 22, receiving 10.6
 million votes out of a total of 11.6 million votes.
 Women are moderately active in political life. Four women are
 members of the FLN's Central Committee, and 60 women ran for
 seats in the 295-member National Assembly in elections in
 1987. However, only 6 were elected, marking a decline from
 the previous number of 10 female deputies.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The officially recognized Algerian League of Human Rights
 (ALHR), established in 1987 by a number of independent
 Algerians, grew to 350 members in 1988 with representation in
 nearly half of the country's provincial districts. As noted
 above, it lobbied successfully in 1988 for the release of
 almost all political prisoners. Following the October riots,
 the group reviewed with President Bendjedid its concerns about
 human rights abuses during the disturbances, and formation of
 commissions of inquiry to examine these allegations. It also
 called for a national investigative commission to determine
 the causes of the disturbances. President Bendjedid
 instructed the Justice Minister to investigate reports of
 torture. By year's end the Justice Ministry had taken no
 specific action against any individuals. The ALHR issued a
 statement December 31 applauding President Bendjedid's
 commitment to civil liberties, but denouncing recent
 government actions which it said seemed to run counter to that
 commitment, including the banning of a "symbolic trial of
 torture in Algeria," to have been sponsored by the Committee
 for National Mobilization Against Torture, and a roundtable
 human rights discussion organized by the FLN's weekly
 publication Revolution Africaine.
 The Algerian Government normally does not readily discuss its
 human rights record with outside governmental or
 nongovernmental organizations. Although the Government gave
 official recognition in 1987 to the ALHR, it continued to
 refuse to recognize internationally known human rights lawyer
 Ali Yahia Abdennour's unsanctioned human rights league. After
 
 
 1284
 ALGERIA
 releasing from prison or house arrest all the members of this
 league in 1987, in 1988 the Government granted Abdennour
 himself permission to travel outside the country. In
 September Abdennour was arrested by Algerian authorities and
 charged with making antigovernment statements to the press
 while in France in August, but he was subsequently released.
 Efforts to date to establish an office of AI in Algiers also
 have not been successful.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 It does not appear that minority groups are treated unfairly
 in access to jobs, housing, education, and health care. The
 Government's difficulties in meeting these social needs are
 mostly linked to the country's extremely rapid population
 growth, and minorities seem to fare no better or worse than
 the Arab majority. The Government continues to give special
 attention, however, to the building of houses, schools, and
 municipal infrastructure in Berber regions. One result is
 that the rate of school attendance among Berbers is higher
 than in most other parts of the country. Nevertheless, Berber
 ethnic consciousness remains strong and is fueled mostly by
 their desire to preserve their distinctive cultural identity
 and language in the face of the Government's emphasis on the
 development of Algeria's Arab identity. Berber spokesmen
 assert that the Government seeks to repress the distinct
 Berber culture, including teaching and propagation of the
 Berber language.
 Women generally enjoy equality under the law, but there are
 exceptions. For example, the 1984 family code permits
 polygamy, makes it more difficult for a woman than a man to
 obtain a divorce, and awards only 4 months of alimony to the
 woman in the event of divorce, regardless of the husband's
 means and the circumstances under which the divorce was
 obtained. Both culture and tradition make it difficult for
 women to follow an independent path; a woman remains
 throughout her life under the legal guardianship of a
 man--whether husband, father, or brother--regardless of her
 age or civil status.
 About 250,000 Algerian women work outside the home and an
 increasing number are trained and employed in the
 professions. Women serve in the armed forces. The literacy
 rate in Arabic or French (or both) among males over the age of
 9 is 65 percent and only 40 percent for females in the same
 category. However, an effort has been made to close the gap
 separating women from men in education. According to
 government statistics, 72 percent of all school-age girls were
 enrolled in 1985. The rate of female school attendance varies
 widely from urban centers to conservative rural areas. The
 Government has established a nationwide educational program
 for women encouraging proper spacing of pregnancies as a means
 of safeguarding the mother's health, improving infant care,
 and reducing the high population growth rate. The program
 provides free access to contraceptives and counseling on a
 voluntary basis. Abortion is illegal in Algeria. There are
 no coercive population control practices.
 
 
 1285
 ALGERIA
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Workers do not have the right to form autonomous labor
 unions. In 1987 the International Labor Organization (ILO)
 Committee of Experts reported that the single trade union
 system in Algeria was reinforced by legislation and acted to
 deny workers the possibility of establishing and joining
 organizations of their own choosing. Since 1962 the right to
 organize and represent workers has been the prerogative of the
 General Union of Algerian Workers (UGTA), an FLN "mass
 organization.* Though considered a government entity, the
 UGTA in 1988 took on more of an activist role, particularly
 concerning wages and job security, as the effects of the
 Government's austerity program were increasingly felt. In
 late 1988 there were widespread instances of workers defying
 the UGTA and establishing independent, factory-level trade
 unions.
 Strikes are illegal in the public sector, and may only be
 called in the private sector upon the approval of the UGTA
 authorities. The ILO Committee of Experts has pointed out
 that legislation prescribing prison sentences for striking
 workers is an infringement of the right to strike. It has
 also noted the impropriety of having internal union strike
 decision procedures determined by an official presidential
 ordinance rather than by union bylaws. In several recent
 instances, however, workers in private enterprises have
 successfully engaged in unsanctioned work stoppages to win
 more pay and protect benefits. Moreover, in the fall of 1988
 there was a wave of strikes by public employees and workers in
 state enterprises without apparent legal reaction. Still,
 most labor-management disputes are resolved in face-to-face
 meetings, often with the intermediary presence of Labor
 Ministry inspectors.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 A new labor law, passed in July, maintains UGTA's status as
 the sole authorized worker's representative, while providing
 for full representation and unfettered organizing under UGTA
 auspices, collective bargaining, access to the workplace,
 unrestricted issuance of union publications, and time off for
 official union activities. In the wake of labor unrest in the
 fall, however, the July reforms remain to be translated into
 practice and further revisions of labor legislation appear
 possible. Antiunion discrimination remains illegal, and
 unions are granted the right to initiate collective and
 individual court cases against employers. Labor laws are
 enforced uniformly throughout the country. There are no
 export processing zones in Algeria.
 c. Prohibition of Forced 6r Compulsory Labor
 There is no forced or compulsory labor.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 The minimum employment age is 18 years old. The minimum age
 is enforced in the state sector, the country's largest
 employment sector. It is unregulated in the small private
 sector, but violations are not widespread.
 
 
 1286
 ALGERIA
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 The new law did not change Algeria's employment standards.
 There is a 44-hour workweek and strict occupational and health
 regulations. The legal minimum wage is very low--$225 at the
 official exchange rate--and is not adequate to provide a
 family with a decent standard of living, given the large
 average size of Algerian families.
 
 
 1287
