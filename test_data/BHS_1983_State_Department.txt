 THE BAHAMAS
 The Bahamas, with a population of about 220,000, is a multiparty,
 parliamentary democracy. As a Commonwealth country, its political
 and legal traditions are similar to those of Great Britain, with
 emphasis on the rights of individuals. The Government has a Prime
 Minister, a Cabinet, a Parliament, an independent judiciary, and
 regular national elections. The Progressive Liberal Party has
 governed since 1964 under the same leader, Sir Lynden Pindling.
 The country has a tradition of human rights observance. The
 Constitution provides for the protection of fundamental rights and
 freedoms without discrimination by reason of race, origin,
 political opinions, color, creed, or sex, and its provisions are
 carried out in practice. The judiciary is independent, and the
 Privy Council in the United Kingdom serves as the court of final
 appeal.
 No major changes have occurred in the human rights record in the
 past year.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Unlawful or Arbitrary Deprivation of Life
 There have been no killings for political motives during recent
 years. There are no known terrorist groups in the country.
 b. Disappearance
 There have been no cases of abduction, secret arrests, or
 clandestine detention.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Torture and cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment
 are prohibited by the Constitution. There are some credible
 reports of police brutality in making arrests, occasionally
 involving American citizens as well as Bahamians. Redress is
 possible through the courts but is rarely sought.
 The downtown Nassau jail is crowded and unsanitary. Conditions at
 the Fox Hill Prison are austere but adequate, and the prison has a
 rehabilitation program.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The Constitution prohibits arbitrary arrest and imprisonment and
 requires that persons be charged without undue delay. This is
 observed in practice. There are no political prisoners. Habeas
 corpus is observed. Charges must be brought within 24 hours of an
 arrest.
 a. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Trials are fair and public. The Constitution entitles defendants
 to counsel, and access to defendants is freely permitted. The
 judiciary is independent of executive or military control, and
 there is no political interference in its activities.

 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Government of The Bahamas does not interfere in the private
 lives of its citizens. The sanctity of the home is safeguarded
 by custom, law, and tradition and is respected in practice.
 The Constitution permits searches to occur only with a
 court-issued warrant. Personal privacy is respected, and there
 are no known cases of wiretapping or interception of
 correspondence.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 There continues to be full freedoms of speech and press. There
 are three privately owned daily newspapers, one privately owned
 radio station with three frequencies, and one television
 station. Some of the newspapers support political parties,
 including the radical left. The television station is
 government-owned and has been accused continually of political
 reporting biased in favor of the ruling party. There is no
 political censorship or intimidation of journalists.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Constitution protects the right to assemble freely and
 associate with others and specifically mentions political
 parties and trade unions. Labor unions are independent of the
 Government and are free to organize, assemble, bargain, and
 strike. -In October on the reconvening of Parliament, the
 unions failed to obtain a permit for a street demonstration but
 demonstrated nevertheless. The police were restrained in
 controlling the demonstrators, and only a few persons hurling
 objects were arrested. Many unions are affiliated with
 counterparts in other countries and in the International Labor
 Organization.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 There is no state religion, and there are no advantages to
 belonging to any particular religion. Freedom of conscience is
 protected, and discrimination on the basis of creed is
 prohibited. The Rastafarians believe they are persecuted by
 the police, but in fact, the police actions have been directed
 against some of the Rastafarian practices, such as drug use and
 the appropriation of property, which are illegal.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel,
 Emigration, and Repatriation
 There is freedom of movement within and outside the country.
 An estimated 12,000 - 20,000 Haitians who left Haiti mainly for
 .economic reasons now reside illegally in The Bahamas. During
 1983 approximately 400 who had been incarcerated were quietly
 repatriated to Haiti. The Bahamas continues to be concerned
 about the arrival of illegal aliens, principally Haitians, and
 insists upon its sovereign right to repatriate them to their
 country of origin. This illegal flow and the repatriations
 appear to be economically rather than politically motivated.

 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to
 Change Their Government
 The Bahamas is a constitutional parliamentary democracy
 governed by a freely elected Prime Minister and Parliament,
 with a resident Governor General under the British Commonwealth
 system. The political process is open to all elements of the
 society. There are two principal political parties, the
 governing and dominant Progressive Liberal Party and the
 opposition, the Free National Movement.
 The Progressive Liberal Party led the country for seven years
 of internal self-government before independence in 1973, and
 has held power without interruption since that time. It
 currently holds 32 of the 43 seats in Parliament. The Free
 National Movement, a more conservative party, holds the other
 11 seats. The leftist party, the Vanguard, has no seats.
 The Progressive Liberal Party has used its tenure in office to
 strengthen its political position and, conversely, to weaken
 the opposition through selective political appointments and by
 hiring mostly political supporters as civil servants. The
 opposition has increasingly accused the party of
 "victimization" or the use of its dominant position to provide
 jobs and business contracts to its supporters but not to its
 opponents.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 There have been no requests from international organizations to
 investigate human rights conditions in The Bahamas. The
 Government has not generally been active in human rights
 affairs but has criticized human rights violations in South
 Africa. Amnesty International did not mention The Bahamas in
 its 1983 report. Freedom House rated the country *free" but
 noted the ruling party's discriminating use of its position to
 strengthen itself in relation to its opposition.
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 Although The Bahamas is made up of some 700 islands or cays,
 only 10 have populations of any size. Of these, two islands,
 New Providence (Nassau) and Grand Bahama, contain over 75
 percent of the population of about 220,000 people. Most
 economic and cultural activities take place on these two
 islands, particularly in New Providence. The Government has
 sought to develop the other, "family," islands to curb the
 movement by young people to the two major centers of activity.
 The Bahamas has a good record of nondiscrimination on sexual,
 racial, and religious grounds. Notwithstanding the transfer of
 political power from the colonial white elite to a black
 majority (80 percent) in the 1960's, a few white Bahamians hold
 high-level civil service and political posts, and one is a
 member of Parliament. Women participate prominently in all
 levels of business and government. In both law and practice
 women enjoy equal status. Women serve as Permanent Secretaries
 in ministries, and one holds a seat in Parliament. Women are
 well represented in the professional and private sectors. Many
 businesses in the principal commercial district catering to
 tourists are owned by women. Several of the magistrates are
 female, and women serve as uniformed police officers.

 According to Bahamian statistics, there has been marked
 improvement in health conditions in recent years. Life
 expectancy at birth reached 69 years by 1979, and the infant
 mortality rate dropped to 29.4 per 1,000 live births in 1983.
 The World Bank estimates the annual population growth rate was
 two percent in 1983. Sixty-five percent of the population had
 access to safe water, with 100 percent in urban areas but only
 13 percent in rural areas in 1979.
 The Bahamas has 925 hospital beds, and Ministry of Health
 doctors make regular trips to the outer islands.
 In education, the Government is placing new emphasis on
 technical and vocational training. While literacy rates have
 remained about 93 percent over the past decade, shortages of
 teachers, equipment, and supplies as well as deterioration of
 many schools have resulted in a weakening of education in the
 public school system. There are 225 schools in The Bahamas, of
 which 62 are primary.
 Per capita Gross National Product was estimated at $2,750 in
 1979. Inflation in 1981 was an estimated 13 percent.
 Unemployment is an estimated 25 percent and climbs to
 approximately 50 percent for Bahamians between 16 and 24 years
 of age. Some of the unemployed have apparently turned to crime
 and drug smuggling.
 The Government is trying to reduce unemployment, particularly
 by creating new jobs in tourism through both private and public
 investment. The Bahamas has announced plans to establish a
 free trade zone in New Providence to create additional
 employment opportunities.
