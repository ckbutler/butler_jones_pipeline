 HONG KONG
 Hong Kong, a small, densely populated British dependency, is a
 free society with legally protected rights but without a broad
 democratic base. Its constitutional arrangements are defined
 by letters patent and royal instructions. Executive powers are
 vested in a British Crown-appointed Governor who holds
 extensive authority. Ultimate control over the territory,
 however, rests with the United Kingdom Government. The
 Governor, by convention, rarely exercises the full extent of
 his powers. The Government is advised by an appointed
 Executive Council. The legislature is only partially elected
 by universal suffrage. The judiciary is an independent body
 adhering to English common law with certain variations.
 Fundamental rights ultimately rest on oversight by the British
 Parliament. In practice, however, Hong Kong largely controls
 its own internal affairs.
 A well-organized pivilian police force maintains public order
 and respects the human rights of the populace.
 Hong Kong's free market economy continued its transition toward
 becoming a shipping, marketing, and finance center. It serves
 as an investment center of trade with China and as a
 communication and transportation hub for Asia. Per capita
 gross domestic product increased by 3.6 percent in 1991 to a
 projected $13,534.
 Several significant events in 1991 strengthened human rights in
 the territory. In June the legislature passed a Bill of
 Rights, modeled on the International Covenant on Civil and
 Political Rights. Although it provided a 1-year "freeze"
 period during which six laws relating to law and order are
 exempt, the bill is already beginning to have a real impact on
 the protection of human rights. ThePeople's Republic of China
 (PRC) Government said it reserved the right to review the bill
 after 1997 when Hong Kong reverts to Chinese sovereignty. For
 the first time in the territory's history, voters went to the
 polls on September 15 to directly elect--in free and fair
 elections--18 members of the new legislature. Nevertheless,
 the directly elected members constitute less than a third of
 the membership of the legislature. Fully representative
 government employing universal franchise does not exist in Hong
 Kong, and people do not have the power to change their
 government. Liberal forces that swept the direct elections are
 pressing for a faster pace of democratization.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section I Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 There were no reports that such killings occurred.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reports of any disappearances.
 c. Torture.and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Torture and other extreme forms of abuse are forbidden by law
 and subject to punishment. Individual acts of police brutality
 occurred. More than 1,600 complaints of "police assault" were
 
 
 1302
 HONG KONG
 made in 1990,'of which 29 were substantiated. Disciplinary
 measures ranged from instituting criminal proceedings to
 placing warnings in the offendeis' service record. In January
 a panel investigating allegations of police brutality at a camp
 for Vietnamese boat people called for disciplinary action
 against some of the officers involved. The police are still in
 the process'of reviewing the recommended sanctions.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 British legal protections and common law traditions govern the
 process of arrest and detention and ensure substantial and
 effective legal protections against arbitrary arrest or
 detention. Exile is not practiced.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Hong Kong's judicial and legal systems are organized according
 to principles of British constitutional law and legal
 precedents and feature, inter alia, an independent judiciary
 and trial by jury. The right to a fair public trial is
 guaranteed and practiced. In September the Appeals Court
 overturned several provisions of the Dangerous Drug Law which
 presumed a defendant guilty until proved otherwise.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The right of privacy is generally respected and provided for by
 law. However, the extraordinary powers of the Independent
 Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) have been criticized by
 some human rights groups. Vested with powers which are
 normally exercised only by a judicial officer, the ICAC has
 independent authority to issue arrest or search warrants, and
 it operates on the assumption that any excessive, unexplainable
 assets held by a civil servant are considered to be ill-gotten
 until proven otherwise. The ICAC's extensive powers are
 expected to be modified or changed as a result of the enactment
 of the Bill of Rights.
 Section 2 Respect. for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 There is a tradition of free speech and press as practiced in
 Great Britain. Numerous views and opinions, including those
 independent or critical of the British and Hong Kong
 Governments, are aired in the mass media, in public forums, and
 by political groups. In January the High Court cleared on
 appeal five activists who were convicted and fined in July 1990
 for an earlier incident, during which they used megaphones
 without permits to protest the PRC-drafted Basic Law, Hong
 Kong's constitution after 1997, and to collect money without a
 permit to help prodemocracy activists in China. In a decision
 described as "an historic affirmation of the independence of
 the judiciary," the Chief Justice admonished the Executive
 Branch for abusing the court process.
 Accusing the Government of bowing to pressure from China,
 student activists criticized the Government for denying entry
 to several overseas Chinese students holding valid visas to
 attend a conference in July on democracy in China.
 
 
 1303
 HONG KONG
 International media organizations operate freely in Hong Kong
 but restrictions, rarely imposed, may be placed on the press
 under several ordinances of Hong Kong law. Hong Kong media
 representatives have expressed concern over the provision of
 the 1988 film censorship ordinance that permits the censoring
 of a film if the film would seriously damage good relations
 with "other territorial units." A local arts ,center canceled a
 film series examining the June 4 Beijing massacre. The films
 were eventually shown under a different sponsor. Pressure from
 China, as exemplified by a PRC political figure calling on the
 Chinese courts to take legal action against the local media,
 raised concern within the territory. A survey released in
 September revealed that 69 percent of local journalists
 believed press freedom would be curtailed after 1997. There is
 also concern that self-censorship is rising when dealing with
 China. According to the same survey, 23 percent admitted they
 were apprehensive about criticizing China.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 These freedoms are practiced without significant hindrance.
 The Government, on grounds of maintaining public order and
 security, may impose controls on the route and time of
 processions.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Government policy and general practice ensure freedom of
 religion.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Travel documents are obtainable freely and easily, subject to
 neither arbitrary nor discriminatory practices. There is
 freedom of movement within Hong Kong. Citing the Bill of
 Rights, the courts struck down in July provisions that'
 prevented people from leaving the territory for nonpayment of
 taxes.
 Hong Kong citizens, though citizens of a British dependent'
 territory, do not enjoy the right of abode in the United
 Kingdom (U.K.). In February, however, the Government accepted
 applications for full U.K. citizenship in accordance with the
 British Nationality (Hong Kong) Act of 1990 which was passed in
 the wake of the heightened concern over the future of the
 territory after the June 4 crackdown in Beijing. The Act
 granted U.K. passports with the right of abode in Britain to up
 to 50,000 heads of family and their dependents. More than
 65,000 applications were received for the 43,250 places
 available in the first phase of the program.
 In response to the large outflow of boat people from Vietnam to
 Hong Kong, the Government implemented a screening program for
 all Vietnamese arriving in Hong Kong after June 16, 1988. It
 detains new arrivals in prison-like centers until and unless
 they are classified as refugees. Those whom the Government and
 the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) conclude are
 not refugees remain in the detention centers until their
 repatriation to Vietnam can be arranged in cooperation with the
 UNHCR.
 During 1991 new arrivals were still held in austere, crowded
 detention centers. The Government continued a screening
 process to identify genuine refugees. The UNHCR and interested
 
 
 1304
 HONG KONG
 observers noted during the year that the Government had
 substantially improved this process since the inception of the
 program. In April, nine Vietnamese, who had challenged the
 fairness of the screening procedures with a lawsuit, settled
 the case in return for a second evaluation of their claim by
 the Government. After the review, the Government recognized
 two of the nine people as refugees. The remaining seven
 persons asked the UNHCR to use its mandate to classify them as
 refugees. The UNHCR had not made a decision by the end of the
 year.
 The year 1991 saw a renewed influx of boat people, fueling
 local calls for the Government to take further measures to
 address the problem. By the end of September 19,500 boat
 people had arrived, bringing the total number to 64,870, equal
 to more than 1 percent of the territory's population. Despite
 the steady inflow of people during the year, the Legislative
 Council, reflecting the desires of many Hong Kong residents,
 refused to appropriate money to build new living quarters. The
 result was increasingly crowded conditions in the existing
 detention centers. Sporadic, internecine violence flared up in
 the centers between rival gangs. The homicide rate increased
 slightly over previous years. There were no significant acts
 of government intrusion.
 Over the summer months, government representatives engaged in
 negotiations with the Vietnamese Government and the UNHCR in
 Hanoi regarding the establishment of an internationally managed
 holding center in Vietnam for those people who have been
 finally classifised as nonrefugees. The Vietnamese rejected
 the proposal but agreed to a renewal of mandatory repatriation
 from Hong Kong.
 On November 9, the Hong Kong Government carried out the
 mandatory repatriation of 59 Vietnamese bbat people who had
 previously returned to Vietnam voluntarily and then traveled to
 Hong Kong a second time. Several of the returnees resisted,
 and unarmed police officers carried them aboard the plane. The
 Hong Kong Government repatriated, without incident, 16 more
 "doublebackers" on December 10, together with 12 Vietnamese
 asylum seekers whose claim to refugee status had been denied.
 The United States Government reiterated its opposition to the
 forcible return of persons classified as nonrefugees and its
 support for voluntary repatriation.
 The Government maintained its 10-year policy of forcibly
 returning Chinese citizens to the People's Republic of China,
 except in rare instances in which a person qualified as a
 refugee within the meaning of the U.N. Protocol Relating to the
 Status of Refugees. Some human rights groups criticized the
 Government on one occasion for repatriating a person to the PRC
 despite his claim of having a well-founded fear of
 persecution. During'1990 an average of 76 Chinese people,
 mostly young men, were arrested and returned per day.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 While Hong Kong is a free society with most individual freedoms
 and rights protected by law and custom, citizens of the
 territory do not have the right to change their government.
 The Governor is appointed by, and serves at the pleasure of,
 the Crown. He is advised on policy by an appointed Executive
 Council. Legislation is enacted and funds provided by the
 Legislative Council, which also debates policy and questions
 
 
 1305
 HONG KONG
 the administration. Though the Governor has the ultimate
 control of the administration of Hong Kong, by convention he
 rarely exercises the full extent of his powers. In practice,
 decisions are arrived at by consensus.
 Representative government employing universal franchise does
 not exist. In a limited step toward a more democratic form of
 government, voters on September 15 were able to elect for the
 first time 18 of the 60 members of the new legislature. Of the
 rest, 21 were either appointed by the Government or are
 themselves government officials. Another 21 were elected by
 functional groupings, e.g., lawyers. Critics charge that
 functional constituencies disproportionately represent the
 economic and professional elites and, moreover, violate the
 concept of one person, one vote, since voters in functional
 constituencies can vote both in a functional and a geographic
 constituency. Liberal forces won 16 of the 18 seats and urged
 the Government to approach China to increase the number of
 directly elected seats in the next legislature to be elected in
 1995. China refused to consider any increase.-
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 There are no official barriers to the formation of local human
 rights groups. 'The Government has consistently cooperated with
 international and nongovernmental organizations on human rights
 issues. The UNHCR and nongovernmental human rights
 organizations have full access to Hong Kong's centers for
 Vietnamese boat people. In April delegates from the
 Government, as well as from local human rights groups, attended
 and submitted status reports to a U.N. Human Rights Committee
 hearing on Hong Kong which focused on the importance of
 continued international monitoring of human rights after 1997.
 A delegation from the International Commission of Jurists
 arrived in June to conduct hearings on human rights. An
 international delegation observed the September elections.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or.Social Status
 The Chinese language has equal status with English in many
 government operations. Enabling legislation passed in March
 1987 provides for principal legislation to be enacted on a
 bilingual basis. The Attorney General's Chambers, moreover, is
 responsible for translating existing laws into Chinese.
 Legislative Council proceedings are also bilingual. The
 Government is continuing its efforts to place Hong Kong Chinese
 in top administrative and policy positions but progress has
 been slow, especially in the legal and police departments and
 the judiciary.
 The only legislation to protect the rights of battered women is
 the Domestic Violence Ordinance, passed in 1987, which enables
 a woman to take out a 3-month injunction on her husband. This
 may be extended to 6 months. In addition, domestic violence
 may be prosecuted as common assault under existing criminal
 statutes. The Government enforces these laws and prosecutes
 violators. Nevertheless, women's action groups are pressing
 for better legal and government provisions for battered wives.
 They called for public housing to house women as soon as they
 leave their violent husbands. Figures for cases of battered
 spouses known to the Government have been dropping over the
 past 3 years from 433 in 1988/8� to 252'in 1989/90 and 228 in
 
 
 1306
 HONG KONG
 1990/91. Admissions to two women's refuges, one operated by
 the Social Welfare Department and the other by Harmony House, a
 private voluntary agency, have not shown a dramatic increase.
 The number of women admitted to Harmony House ranged from 166
 in 1988 to 105 in 1989, 141 in 1990 and 164 in 1991. Figures
 for the government-run refuge showed a similar trend: 126, 97,
 139, and 136. Nevertheless, all sources say that many
 instances of domestic violence are not reported, owing partly
 to cultural factors which frown on exposing family crises to
 the public eye, but also to a lack of well-publicized
 information about assistance and resources available.
 Women's groups complained that the Bill of Rights does not
 adequately deal with sexual discrimination, including on pay,
 employment, and inheritance. They urge that the International
 Convention for the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination
 Against Women be extended to Hong Kong. A controversial
 amendment to force spouses to testify against their abusive
 partners was defeated in the legislature in May. While a
 number of women hold senior appointive government positions,
 only two women were elected to the legislature.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 The right of association and the right of workers to establish
 and join organizations of their own choosing are guaranteed
 under local law. Trade unions must be registered under the
 Trade Union Ordinance. The basic precondition for registration
 is that at least seven persons must serve in the same
 occupation. Once registered, unions become corporate bodies
 and enjoy immunity from certain civil suits involving breaking
 of contingent contracts or interference with trade owing to
 work stoppages by their members. Unions also have the right to
 elect their own representatives, publicize their views, and
 determine their own bylaws and policies in representing
 members' interests. The Government does not discourage or
 impede union formation. An amendment to the Trade Union
 Ordinance in 1988 permits unions to maintain political action
 funds which are restricted to local elections. Dur-ing 1990, 23
 new unions were registered.
 Nonetheless, only about 439,000 workers (or 15.8 percent) out
 of a total labor force of 2.8 million belong to one of the 494
 registered unions. Apathy toward unionism on the part of
 workers, reinforced by the Confucian cultural heritage and its
 emphasis on family responsibility, is the principal reason for
 this phenomenon.
 Work stoppages and strikes are permitted. However, there are
 some restrictions on this right for civil servants. Employees
 hired on a contract basis may be fired for breach of contract
 if they walk off the job. As of the end of November, work
 stoppages resulted in the loss of 202 workdays.
 Hong Kong labor unions may form federations, confederations, or
 affiliate with international bodies. Any affiliation with
 foreign labor unions needs the consent of the Government; no
 request has been turned down.
 As a dependent territory of the United Kingdom, Hong Kong is
 not a member in its own right of the International Labor
 Organization (ILO). The United Kingdom makes declarations on
 behalf of Hong Kong concerning the latter's obligations
 
 
 1307
 HONG KONG
 regarding the various ILO conventions. To date Hong Kong has
 implemented provisions applying 29 conventions in full and 18
 others with modifications. In the Basic Law, China has
 undertaken to continue to adhere to these conventions after
 1997.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 The right to organize and bargain collectively is guaranteed
 under local law. Hong Kong laws pertaining to collective
 bargaining cover mainly the shipping, textile, public
 transport, public utility, and carpentry trades, and the
 catering, construction, public service, and teaching
 professions. Wages are usually set by employers on the basis
 of market factors. While collective bargaining does take
 place, it is not widely practiced, and in general there are no
 mechanisms specifically to encourage it.
 Hong Kong law does, however, provide for a system to handle
 settlement of disputes. Free conciliation service is afforded
 by the Labor Relations Division of the Department of Labor
 (DOL) to employers and employees involved in labor disputes or
 grievances. This division is charged with finding a mutually
 acceptable settlement, although it does not have the authority
 to impose a solution. According to the Government, the vast
 majority of disputes are resolved with the assistance of this
 division. If initial conciliation efforts are unsuccessful, a
 dispute may be referred to arbitration with the consent of the
 parties, or a board of inquiry may be established to
 investigate and make suitable recommendations. Use of this
 system is widespread. Workers are protected against antiunion
 discrimination under Hong Kong legislation. Employees who
 allege such discrimination have the right to have their cases
 heard by the DOL's Labor Relations Division. Employers who
 attempt to prevent or deter an employee from joining a labor
 union, or who terminate an employee for joining a labor union,
 are liable to a fine of approximately $650.
 Individual labor claims are adjudicated by the Labor Tribunal,
 a part of the judicial branch, which provides quick,
 inexpensive machinery for resolving disputes arising between
 workers and management over breach of contract, wages in lieu
 of notice, or termination of service, arrears of wages, and
 other claims relating to pay. The Tribunal complements ,the
 conciliation service provided by the DOL's Labor Relations
 Division.
 There are no export processing zones in Hong Kong.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Existing labor legislation prohibits forced labor, and it does
 not appear to be practiced.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 Under the Women and Young Persons Regulations and Employment
 for Children Regulations, minors are allowed to do limited
 part-time work in nonindustrial establishments beginning at age
 13, subject to conditions aimed at ensuring a minimum of 9
 years' education. They are allowed to engage in full-time work
 at age 15. Employment of females under age 18 in
 establishments subject to liquor regulations is prohibited.
 The Labor Inspectorate conducts workplace inspections to ensure
 that working hours conform to the law and that no persons under
 
 
 1308
 HONG KONG
 the age of 15 are employed. During 1990 the Inspectorate
 carried out 220,148 inspections of more than 21,818
 establishments in industrial and nonindustrial sectors, which
 resulted in 63 cases of child eniployment brougft before the
 courts. Some labor observers maintain, however, that
 successful prosecution against employers who hire underaged
 workers is rare, partly because of the inadequate number of
 inspectors and partly because of the reluctance of workers to
 testify against-their employers.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 There is no legislated minimum wage. Wage rates are determined
 by supply and demand. In view of continued tightness in Hong
 Kong's labor market (unemployment was 1.7 percent for the third
 quarter of 1990), higher wages were offered to workers,
 particularly in the construction industry and service sectors.
 Many employees also enjoy a year-end bonus of a month's pay or
 more. Some employers in the manufacturing sector provide
 workers with various kinds of allowances, free medical
 treatment, and free or subsidized transport.
 The Women and Young Persons Regulations under the Employment
 Ordinance control hours and conditions of work for women and
 young people in industry. Hours of work are limited to 8 per
 day and 48 per week between 6 a.m. and 8 p.m. for women and
 between 7 a.m. and 7 p.m. for young persons under age 19.
 There are no legal restrictions on hours of work for men.
 Overtime is restricted to 2 hours per day and 200 days per year
 for women and is prohibited for all persons under 18.
 The Labor Department's Factory Inspectorate promotes workers'
 safety and health in industry through education, publicity, and
 inspection in accordance with the Factories and Industrial
 Undertakings Ordinance and subsidiary regulations. The
 Inspectorate pays particular attention to safety in high-risk
 areas of factories and construction sites. During 1990
 inspectors visted 17,769 factories and 630 construction sites
 and issued 870 summons. As part of a complementary effort, the
 Department's Occupational Health Division investigates claims
 of occupational diseases, conducts environmental testing in the
 workplace, and provides medical examinations to employees in
 occupations that involve the handling of hazardous materials.
 Independent labor unions maintain that the small number of
 qualified factory inspectors is a longstanding problem.
