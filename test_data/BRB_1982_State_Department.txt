 BAREADOS
 Barbados is a constitutional democracy. Its House of Assembly
 is the third oldest in the Western Hemisphere, after Bermuda
 and Virginia. A basic statement of the rights and privileges
 of Barbadians, known as the Charter of Barbados, was proclaimed
 in 1652 and has been upheld by those governing the island.
 Barbados achieved full independence on November 30, 1966. It
 enjoys a free and democratic system of government. Its two
 political parties are based more on history and personalities
 than on ideological differences. Both parties tend toward
 moderate socialism and have taken control of power in turn
 during three decades of self-rule. The Prime Minister is the
 head of government. The Governor General, a Barbadian named by
 the British monarch, wields very little political power.
 Current annual per capita income in Barbados is approximately
 US$3,400 which puts the country in the forefront of developing
 Eastern Caribbean countries. The mainstays of the economy are
 light manufacturing, tourism, services, and sugar. Trends in
 1982 indicate that the country has closely adhered to the
 rights granted and protected by the nation's Constitution. The
 human rights situation in Barbados is excellent. The current
 situation is likely to continue into the foreseeable future.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Killing
 No cases of killing for political motives have been reported in
 years.
 b. Disappearance
 There have been no reports in 1982 of disappearances.
 c. Torture
 Torture is specifically prohibited by the Constitution, and
 there have been no reports that it is practiced.
 d. Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 There have been no reports of cruel, inhuman, or degrading
 treatment or punishment. Prison conditions are humane. There
 have been no reports that prisoners are physically mistreated.
 Attorneys have ready access to their clients. Amnesty
 International has protested the execution of some convicted
 murderers by hanging.
 e. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 The Constitution prohibits arbitrary arrest and imprisonment.
 This prohibition is respected in practice. The right of habeas
 corpus is guaranteed and observed. An individual must be taken
 before a court of law within 72 hours after arrest.
 f. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The Constitution provides that persons charged with a criminal
 offense be given a fair, public hearing within a reasonable
 time by an independent and impartial court. Defendants are
 presumed innocent until proven guilty. These guarantees are
 respected in practice. The judiciary acts independently and is
 free from intervention from other branches of government.

 g. Invasion of the Home
 The Constitution prohibits arbitrary search or entry. This
 prohibition is respected in practice. Warrants are required
 for entry and search of privately-owned property.
 2. Respect for Civil and Political Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution guarantees freedom of speech and press. These
 freedoms are respected in Barbados. The two regular newspapers
 and one radio station function independently of the
 Government. The Government owns and operates the Caribbean
 Broadcasting Corporation Radio and Television Service, which is
 modeled after the British Broadcasting Corporation. However,
 charges of Government intervention in the media have been
 rare.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The constitutional guarantees for peaceful assembly and private
 organizations are observed. Labor is free, strong, and well
 organized in Barbados. Protests or strikes have occurred when
 collective bargaining has failed. Although one major union has
 some ties to the opposition party, in general labor leaders and
 the rank-and-file are motivated primarily by economic and
 social, not political, considerations.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 There is full freedom of religion. While the Anglican and
 Methodist faiths dominate, even the smallest religious groups
 have houses of worship.
 d. Freedom of Movement within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 There are no impediments to free movement of citizens or legal
 residents within or without Barbados. The Constitution
 guarantees the right to move freely throughout the country, to
 reside anywhere in Barbados, to enter and leave Barbados, and
 to be exempt from expulsion. Barbados has had a limited number
 of refugees and requests for asylum. These are handled on a
 case-by-case basis. Barbados has been generous in its
 treatment of those whose applications are denied. In at least
 one known case, it granted a refugee a one-year temporary visa
 after his application for asylum was denied, in order to allow
 him to make alternate arrangements.
 e. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Barbados is a parliamentary democracy following the British
 model, There are no impediments to participation in the
 political process. The ruling political party, the Barbados
 Labor Party is termed "moderate* with a socialist orientation
 similar to that of the British Labor Party. The other major
 party in Barbados, the Democratic Labor Party, does not differ
 from the ruling party in basic objectives. Consequently,
 electoral contests and political disputes are essentially
 partisan encounters with a focus on personalities as much as
 issues. There is no discrimination based on race or sex.
 Barbados is a signatory to the Convention on the Elimination of
 All Forms of Discrimination Against Women adopted by the United
 
 
 404
 Nations in December 1979. Women actively participate in all
 aspects of national life. One cabinet member is a woman, and
 women are well-represented at all levels in both the public and
 private sectors.
 3. Government Attitude Regarding International and Non-
 governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations of
 Human Rights
 There have been no reports of human rights violations in
 Barbados or requests by human rights groups either within or
 outside the country to investigate allegations. Barbados
 officially advocates strengthening the human rights machinery
 of the United Nations and the Organization of American States.
 The Government is in favor of more investigations of alleged
 violations of human rights in other countries and increased use
 of fact-finding or observer teams to monitor controversial
 political and electoral situations. There are several small
 groups fostering international human rights consciousness.
 4. Economic, Social, and Cultural Situation
 Barbados has a population of 286,000 with a low (0.9 percent)
 growth rate due to continued emigration and a declining birth
 rate. A tradition of political stability and prudent economic
 management has helped to place Barbados high on the World Bank
 list of developing countries in terms of per capita income.
 Barbados had a 1981 gross national product per capita income of
 about $3,400. However, after several years of solid.economic
 growth, Barbados has been in a period of economic downturn
 caused by a combination of sugar crop shortfalls in two
 successive years, continued increase in world petroleum prices
 (75 percent of the oil used is imported), and a 10 percent
 decrease in tourist sector activity. The Government has
 carefully monitored the economic barometer, has raised taxes
 and reduced public sector spending, and has sought an IMF
 standby credit to compensate for reduced foreign exchange
 receipts from the tourism and sugar industries.
 The 1966 proclamation of the Constitution called for the
 Government to promote the general welfare of the citizens of
 Barbados through equitable distribution of wealth. Both past
 and present Governments have pursued that goal by attempting to
 wipe out pockets of poverty while respecting private property.
 The ruling Barbados Labor Party in June 1981 committed itself
 to several public welfare goals, including improvements in
 public housing and community centers and an overhaul of the
 somewhat regressive tax system.
 Citizens have long enjoyed access to public and private
 educational systems, the object of considerable national pride,
 and the adult literacy rate is estimated at 99 percent. The
 government has embarked on a program of expanding the secondary
 school system to ensure that sufficient facilities exist for
 students leaving the primary system.
 Adequate medical care is available to all residents through
 local clinics and hospitals under the Government's health
 program. There is one doctor for every 1,500 people. Average
 life expectancy for Barbadians is 70.8 years. Infant mortality
 is 25.1 per 1,00Q births. Government health insurance programs
 cover all Barbadians. The Government is attempting to meet
 shelter needs through its low-cost housing program. Overall,
 Barbadians are well housed. Land ownership, however, is highly
 concentrated, with 10 percent of the population owning over 95
 
 
 405
 percent of the total. The Government has devoted over 60
 percent of its operating budget and almost 30 percent of its
 capital budget to the fulfillment of vital needs. It also
 contributes to the direct provision of essential goods and
 services through its involvement in statutory boards and
 corporations, such as the Barbados Marketing Corporation,
 intended to guarantee distribution of agricultural products at
 reasonable prices; the Public Assistance Board, which provides
 for the indigent; and the Child Care Board. One hundred
 percent of the population has access to safe water.
