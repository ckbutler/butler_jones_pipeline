 MOZAMBIQUE
 Mozambique gained its independence from Portugal in 1975.
 The government and the sole political party, the Front for
 the Liberation of Mozambique (Frelimo), espouse Marxist-
 Leninist principles and pursue this conception of socialism.
 An extremely poor country, Mozambique's development since
 independence has been hampered by emigration of much of the
 trained personnel, military attacks during the Rhodesian
 war, adverse weather and a persistent insurgency. Civil and
 political rights are greatly circumscribed. Application of
 the law is becoming somewhat more uniform. There have again
 been publicized releases from the "reeducation camps,"
 discussed below, and a presidential instruction to bring the
 operation of these camps into conformity with the constitu-
 tion. Organized religious groups have noted some improvement
 in the government's acceptance of their role.'
 Parts of central Mozambique have been afflicted by civil un-
 rest perpetrated by one or more anti-government organizations.
 Evidence strongly suggests that the oppositon forces are en-
 couraged and supplied from the Republic of South Africa.
 There are documented cases of forced recruitment into these
 bodies as well as their use of torture to intimidate the pop-
 ulace. The government has responded by attempting to concen-
 trate the population in more easily defensible communities
 and reportedly has resorted to coercion in doing so.
 In January 1981, a South African military force entered
 Mozambique and the environs of the capital. It destroyed
 three residences, killing and kidnapping a number of South
 African citizens who were members of the African National
 Congress. Since this occurrence, there has been at least
 one border incident between South African and Mozambican
 military forces resulting in fatalities.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 Torture is prohibited by the constitution. President Machel
 admitted in a speech on November 5, however, that police and
 security officials had, on occasion, illegally used corporal
 punishishment and intimidation to obtain confessions.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 Extremely spartan conditions in places of detention reflect
 societal conditions and are not imposed for purposes of
 discipline. Prisoners of all types were forcibly detained
 in isolated detention camps called by the government "reedu-
 cation centers" in the period following independence. Those
 still confined in these centers reportedly are individuals
 suspected of counter-revolutionary acts or attitudes. No
 other distinction by type of penalty is apparent. Condi-
 tions in some of the camps are reportedly severe, reflecting
 official neglect of the camps.
 During the last year 14 individuals were convicted of
 capital crimes and nine executed, by order of revolutionary
 military tribunals, for crimes "against the people and state
 security." In the absence of a supreme court, there is no
 right of appeal in such cases although there is a presiden-
 tial review.

 c. Disappearances
 There have been no reports of officially inspired *disappear-
 ances."
 d. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 As Mozambique's judicial system has become more institution-
 alized, the occurrences of arbitrary arrests have declined.
 Individuals detained for criminal and political counter-
 revolutionary activities in the immediate post-independence
 period were sent to *reeducation centers." There have been
 publicized releases of different categories of such prisoners
 in recent years including the qualified release of approxi-
 mately 1,250 individuals in August and September 1981. Many
 were released only on the condition that they stay and live
 in the isolated regions near the camps where they had been
 detained. On the occasion of the release of one such group
 in September, President Machel acknowledged that individuals
 were being held in reeducation camps in apparent contradic-
 tion of Mozambican law. A national commission to investigate
 the situation and bring practices into conformity with the
 constitution was established. Its report is still awaited.
 The government has never published figures on the number of
 individuals confined to reeducation camps'but those who
 remain may still number in the thousands.
 The concept of habeas corpus is recognized but administra-
 tive shortcomings and deficiencies vitiate its application.
 Regulations prescribingbrief periods of detention prior
 to bringing formal charges have been promulgated.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Mozambique uses the inquisitional system of justice which
 places considerable initiative and power in the hands of
 investigatory and trial judges. In significant cases in
 the main provincial courts, public defenders are provided.
 Judgment is rendered by one qualified judge and four
 elected "Jurors" by majority vote. In district courts one
 qualified judge and two jurors are instructed to apply
 .good sense* and the constitution in reaching their ver-
 dicts. They may not direct incarceration. Non-security
 related trials are open to the public.
 A revolutionary military tribunal, established in 1979 in
 response to overt and covert Rhodesian military actions in
 Mozambique, deals with cases involving (undefined) "crimes
 against the people and state security." Since Zimbabwe's
 independence, tribunals have tried individuals captured in
 encounters with insurgent groups and those found to be asso-
 ciated with foreign military activities. Nine individuals
 have been executed, five more have been condemned to death
 and several score more have been sentenced to lesser penal-
 ties by four tribunals. Tribunals are staffed by military
 officers and take place in camera.
 f. Invasion of the Home
 The constitution guarantees sanctity of the home. In prac-
 tice, however, civil and security authorities exercise broad
 discretionary powers in carrying out their duties. In the
 last year there were a number of warrantless arrests of prom-
 inent Mozambican and foreign residents. It is widely assumed
 that surveillance devices are attached to the telephone
 network.

 2.   Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 Public opposition to government policies and personalities is
 not tolerated and criticism is confined to matters of marginal
 importance. The press is operated by the government, and
 admittedly and actively promotes Frelimo's social and politi-
 cal objectives. Publication and distribution of domestic
 and imported books is controlled through the government's
 institute for books and records. There is no formal censor-
 ship, but journalists hew closely to the party line.
 There is no state religion in Mozambique. The constitution
 grants individuals "the right to practice or not to practice"
 religion. After independence there were extensive expropria-
 tions of religious facilities, arrests of a number of clergy-
 men because of their presumed links to the colonial regime,
 and the imposition of administrative controls on the prac-
 tice of religion. A gradual relaxatign has occurred in the
 past year. Meetings between religioud leaders and the
 highest levels of the government have been publicized and
 have contributed to an improved climate for the activities
 of religious groups. There have been joint efforts in
 humanitarian undertakings. Administrative procedures which
 had created obstacles to fulfilling religious observances
 have been applied more evenly so as not to impede them.
 However, many former places of worship and instruction
 remain unavailable to their sponsoring sect and administra-
 tive restrictions still limit the activities and movements
 of clergymen in some areas.
 Membership in any organized religious group does not appear
 to confer appreciable advantage or disadvantage in an
 individual's secular standing. Some of the practices of
 traditional cults are criticized and ridiculed by the
 Government and Party organs.
 Assembly and the right to organize are greatly circumscribed.
 The government and party authorize and dominate mass movements,
 professional associations, and "production groups" at indus-
 trial and commercial enterprises. There are no recognizable
 trade unions.
 b. Freedom of Movement within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration and Repatriation
 Travel within the country is controlled by administrative
 and security requirements. Travel abroad is not regarded as
 a right but permission is routinely granted for business,
 educational, recreational, and humanitarian reasons. Emigra-
 tion by Mozambican citizens is not addressed in law or
 regulation although in practice it is discouraged. These
 conditions apply equally to both sexes and all groups.
 There is an indeterminate flow of economic and political
 refugees to neighboring countries. A 1980 agreement with
 Swaziland provides for the reciprocal, forcible return of
 citizens apprehended for illegally entering either country.
 An average of between 35-50 individuals, primarily from
 neighboring countries, are registered as refugees in Mozambi-
 que at any one time. A larger number of individuals from
 South Africa enjoy safehaven. Although Mozambique is not a
 signatory to international conventions on refugees, Mozambi-
 que generally observes their terms.
 There are two broad groupings of individuals seeking repatri-
 
 
 179
 ation. Those who for economic or political motives left the
 country before independence are generally encouraged to
 return to Mozambique. Those dual nationals who, after
 independence, exercised their option to assume their non-
 Mozambican nationality must apply for the right of return.
 The government has shown clemency in considering several
 hundred such cases.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Nozambique is a one party state controlled by the Marxist-
 Leninist party, Frelimo. The party's membership is an
 unknown but small percentage of the total population. The
 constitution guarantees universal adult suffrage. At the
 community and district levels local issues are discussed and
 formal elections held. Officials are chosen from a single
 slate and the extent of public participation is limited to
 endorsement or rejection. Official candidates are occasion-
 ally rejected. There is no open opposition to the party or
 the government. The issues of nationality, citizenship and
 statelessness have not arisen.
 Women are constitutionally guaranteed the same civic rights
 and duties as men. The government and the party have promoted
 the concept that all citizens, including women, must take an
 equal responsibility in society. Women participate in all
 aspects of political life and a few hold senior positions in
 the party and government. Urban women seem to have the same
 access to training and positions of authority as do men. The
 National Women's Organization is given attention and status
 designed to ensure that women enjoy equal rights and the full
 protection of the law. The organization is particularly
 active in areas of development, adult education, literacy and
 social services.
 3. Government Attitude and Record Regarding International
 and Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Neither independent internal nor systematic outside investi-
 gations of human rights have been carried out in Mozambique.
 Amnesty International, relying on reports and public docu-
 ments, has registered its concerns with alleged detention
 without trial, political.imprisonment and use of the death
 penalty. The government has allowed journalists and selected
 scholars to travel extensively in the country and visit
 'reeducation centers.*
 There is local representation of the United Nations High
 Commissioner for*Refugees (UNHCR) and a chapter of the
 International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) was opened in
 1981. Mozambique's performance in response to massive
 dislocation caused by the war in Zimbabwe was generous and
 undertaken at considerable sacrifice. Mozambique is not a
 signatory to international human rights or refugee conven-
 tions.
 4.   Economic and Social Circumstances
 Mozambique has a GNP per capita income of less than $250.
 An estimated 85 percent of its 12.2 million inhabitants is
 engaged in subsistence agriculture. Since independence in
 1975, the modern sector has been beset by chronic equipment,
 personnel and raw material shortages. Production and pro-
 
 
 180
 ductivity in the small industrial sector have experienced
 a general decline, and it is estimated that most industrial
 enterprises are operating at less than 50 percent of capac-
 ity. There has been a proliferation in the number of
 state companies and enterprises as the government pursues
 its objective of organizing the economy along socialist
 lines. However, in the retail and internal trade sector,
 the government has devolved a number of small businesses
 and shops to private enterpreneurs. Appeals for foreign
 investment have continued, but without marked success.
 A continuing cycle of natural disasters, including floods
 and drought, has dimmed Mozambique's agricultural production
 prospects, and made problematical the provision of adequate
 food to a growing population. Mozambique allocates a signif-
 icant portion of its foreign exchange to purchase cereals
 abroad. It receives food relief from a number of interna-
 tional donors and continues to subsidize food staples and
 other basic necessities in an effort to meet the fundamental
 nutritional needs of its citizens.
 A food rationing scheme for the capital of Maputo and
 surrounding areas was introduced in March 1981 and plans
 call for extending the system to other cites. In rural
 areas, malnutrition and undernourishment continue to afflict
 a large segment of the peasant population. Life in rural
 areas remains extremely austere despite government efforts
 to "urbanize the countryside" through creation of communal
 villages and other larger groupings. Resultant dislocations
 have, in fact, further disrupted the already tenuous food
 production/distribution system.
 Unemployment and underemployment in urban areas are high.
 A new wage and salary law which was introduced in late 1980
 established a national wage and salary scale. It increased
 the wages of the lowest paid agricultural and industrial
 workers to the relative financial detriment of trained and
 professional workers.
 Despite growing demands on its limited financial resources,
 the government has continued to emphasize health, human
 services and agriculture as its top development priorities.
 In the publicized 1981 budget, the equivalent of $154.2
 million was allocated to health and education, 14.1 percent
 more than last year and 40 percent of the total increase in
 current government expenditures for 1981. Mozambique's social
 programs are administered in a nondiscriminatory fashion to
 all elements of its population. Racism is abhorrent to the
 Frelimo regime, and no major ethnic conflicts exist among the
 country's major tribal groupings. Many ethnic Portuguese and
 Asians hold important positions in the government and party.
 Genuine efforts have been made to integrate women at all
 levels of society and particular attention is paid to the
 rights and needs of women and children.
 During the colonial period, the African population had
 little access to medical services, and few medical facili-
 ties existed outside of major urban areas. The cumulative
 effect of this historical neglect is reflected in the vast
 medical and health needs faced by Mozambique in 1981.
 Population growth is about 2.5 percent per annum, and life
 expectancy at birth is about 46 years. Maternal mortality
 and morbidity rates are among the highest in Africa. The
 infant mortality rate is 48 per thousand live births and,
 according to UN statistics, 40 percent of all deaths in
 Mozambique occur among children under 5 years of age. At
 least 30 percent of all Mozambican children under 12 suffer
 from undernourishment or malnutrition. Only about 10 percent
 
 
 181
 of Mozambique'& population has access to safe water supplies,
 although the government has initiated a program to supply
 safe water and sanitation facilities to rural and underserved
 urban populations.
 Medical care in Mozambique is nationalized and available at
 very low cost, but its scope and effectiveness are limited
 by a shortage of facilities, doctors, and medical personnel.
 A national program of maternal and child health care and
 family planning was initiated in 1981 in cooperation with
 the .N FUnd for Population Activities. Efforts to increase
 the number of doctors and para-medics through training and
 expanded recruitment abroad have continued.
 Mozambique has made some gains in its educational programs.
 Current estmates are that 15 to 20 percent of the population
 age 15 or more is literate as compared to an adult literacy
 rate in 1978 of only 11 percent. This increase results from
 two national literacy campaigns since independence, continu-
 ing emphasis on adult education, and growing access to
 primary school education. Serious problems remain, however.
 There is a critical shortage of qualified primary and
 Secondary school teachers and UN sources estimate that 2
 million of the eligible school age group still remain beyond
 the reach of the existing educational system. In 1981, a
 campaign was launched at the highest level of the government
 to improve the recognized poor quality of primary and
 secondary school education in Mozambique.
