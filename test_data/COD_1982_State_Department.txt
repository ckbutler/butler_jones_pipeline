 ZAIRE
 Zaire today is a highly centralized and personalized one-
 party state which, due to a lack of preparation by the for-
 mer colonial power, came to independence under particularly
 adverse circumstances. There was a serious civil war fol-
 lowing independence and there have been two invasions from
 abroad. The task of creating and maintaining national unity
 in the vast country remains a priority concern of the coun-
 try's political leadership which emerged in the chaos of the
 early independence years.
 According to the terms of the Constitution, all Zairian
 citizens are automatically members of the People's Revolu-
 tionary Movement. The Executive Council (Prime Minister and
 Council of Ministers), the Legislative Council, and the only
 official labor organization are organs of the ruling
 party. The party-state derives its ideology from the ideas
 and Policies of its president-founder, Mobutu Sese Seko.
 The formation of additional parties is forbidden by the
 Constitution. The President is head of state, appointing
 the Prime Minister (First State Commissioner) and his
 cabinet. He is also the party leader and appoints members
 of its highest organ, the Central Committee. Under the
 Constitution the President can promulgate laws by decree,
 although he shares law-making authority with the elected
 Legislative Council (National Assembly). Elections were
 held in 1982 for local and municipal councils and for the
 National Legislative Council, with multiple candidates,
 screened by the party, for most offices. Zaire has a
 civilian government, but military officers are sometimes
 appointed to government positions, and President Mobutu, who
 retains his military rank, heads the Defense Ministry.
 Zaire's economy, which is based on a combination of private
 and partially state-owned enterprises, remains a critical
 problem. The decline in export receipts, and the inability
 to strengthen economic management have helped provoke a
 serious shortage of foreign exchange and eroded the welfare
 of Zaire's citizens. Most Zairians suffer from a lack of
 food, shelter, health care, transportation, access to
 education, and jobs that pay adequate wages.
 In 1982, at the highest levels of government, efforts were
 undertaken to cooperate more regularly with international
 human rights organizations. President Mobutu received an
 International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) delegation
 early in the year and he personally took steps to facilitate
 the task of the ICRC. However, lower-level officials con-
 tinued to respond slowly to instructions from the ministerial
 level to cooperate with the ICRC. These reforms aimed at
 eliminating abuses and qenerally improving penal system
 management resulted in the release of some prisoners and the
 arrest of officials implicated in malfeasance. Despite
 these efforts, prison conditions, poor to begin with because
 of insufficient supplies and funds, continued to decline.
 Reports of civil liberties abuses--arbitrary arrest, pro-
 longed detention without charges, extortion--were still
 frequent. Thirteen ex-parliamentarians received prison
 sentences for attempting to form a second political party,
 
 
 353
 which the Constitution forbids--a development which called
 attention to the limits on political expression and open
 dissent.
 Zaire, as in the past, provided support and shelter for
 300,000 refugees from Angola, Rwanda, Burundi, Uganda, and
 Zambia. Since 1978, some 200,000 Zairian exiles have been
 repatriated under a government amnesty plan.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Preedom from:
 a. Killing
 There were no substantiated cases of murder for political
 motives, by either the Government or opposition political
 organizations.
 b. Disappearance
 People are arrested and held, sometimes in secret prisons,
 by security services. There are no formal notification
 procedures but security services generally admit custody
 when approached by relatives, friends, and international
 human rights organizations. The number of disappearances is
 undetermined, but the problem appears not to have worsened.
 c. Torture
 There were numerous allegations of torture and some instances
 in which political prisoners were severely beaten, although
 the number of torture incidents is not known. Disciplinary
 action against personnel inflicting physical punishment is
 sporadic.
 d. Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 Physical punishment is not administered as part of sen-
 tences for crimes. However, not all local and lower-level
 officials have been sufficiently educated about the rights
 of prisoners and abuses in jail do occur. Embezzlement and
 mismanagement also plague the prison system. Nationwide,
 prison conditions continue to deteriorate. Poor conditions
 are not an intentional form of degradation, but rather
 mirror general socio-economic conditions in the country.
 Crowding, unsanitary facilities, malnutrition and, in
 several instances, starvation afflict all categories of
 prisoners. Many prisons feed inmates by allowing them to
 farm, hunt, and fish where possible. Families usually
 provide additional food and supplies when permitted.
 Recent cases of criminal neglect and malfeasance have pro-
 voked investigations and the arrest of some of those impli-
 cated. President Mobutu has signed into law judicial and
 penal reforms designed to eliminate detention abuses, reduce
 prison populations, and improve prison management. Implemen-
 tation of these reforms is slow, but during 1982 some 250
 prisoners were released. With the cooperation of the ICRC,
 the Zairian Government is implementing a program of prison
 improvement, focussing on sanitation and food self-sufficiency.

 e. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 Police sweeps and arbitrary arrests decreased in Kinshasa in
 1982, but there is no way to estimate the number of persons
 still being held without charge or benefit of due process.
 Arbitrary arrest and prolonged detention continue to be
 problems despite the legal requirement that those arrested
 be brought before a magistrate to hear charges within 24
 hours.
 There are only 600 magistrates (roughly one per 70,000
 people) in the country. In practice, defendants in criminal,
 security, and military cases are often held for extended
 periods without charges. Some are released after months
 of detention without being brought to trial; others are
 released but placed under restriction during the investiga-
 tion. Corruption is common among irregularly-paid or under-
 paid officials, and arrests are often made by low- and
 mid-level officials on flimsy charges, in order to extort
 bribes for release or to settle personal vendettas.
 Nonjudicial sanctions against persons suspected of threat-
 ening the security of the state are authorized by law. Such
 sanctions range from administrative detention and house
 arrest to banishment to home villages and restriction of
 movement and travel. Suspected critics of the regime have
 been detained without charges by military and security
 services. While several of the more internationally known
 arrestees have been released, others less influential or
 publicized remained in detention for long periods. During
 the past year, some primary and secondary school teachers
 were arrested and deported to their villages in order to
 break a teachers' strike. Family members, friends, and
 supporters of the 13 ex-parliamentarians on trial for
 illegally organizing another political party were arrested
 during the trial, but released in stages afterward.
 f. Denial of Pair Public Trial
 Trials are usually public, and the right to a fair trial
 is provided by law. Defendants have the right to a defense
 counsel, who is generally free from government pressure.
 Indigent defendants are assigned free counsel by the court.
 Private lawyers continue to enjoy freedom and independence
 from government control. In practice, the fairness of
 trials, particularly at the lower levels, is sometimes
 compromised by bias or corruption. Poorly paid judges
 solicit and accept bribes from defendants to render favor-
 able verdicts, and from accusers to find the defendant
 guilty.
 In 1972, a special court for state security was established
 to hear cases involving threats to national security,
 armed robbery, and smuggling. The procedures outlined for
 legal protection in civil courts also apply to defendants
 in security courts, except that the security courts' judg-
 ments cannot be appealed. Procedures for military courts
 are provided for in the military penal code. Normally,
 these courts hear only cases involving military personnel.
 In times of emergency and military operations, the Presi-
 dent can suspend the civilian courts and require that
 all cases be tried in military courts.
 
 
 355
 g. Invasion of the Home
 Although not always observed in practice, judicial warrants
 are required by law before the police are permitted to
 search a home, except in cases of threats to national
 security.
 2. Respect for Civil and Political Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Zairian Constitution provides for freedom of expression
 and guarantees the right of every Zairian citizen to express
 freely his opinions and feelings, whether orally or in
 writing. However, like all other constitutional rights,
 freedom of expression is qualified by the need to insure
 "public order and good conduct."
 The Government controls the media and press which are
 expected to promote the development of the country according
 to the ideals and principles set forth by Zaire's political
 party. Radio and television are owned and operated by the
 Government, and major newspapers are only nominally privately
 owned. Media censorship tends to be self-imposed, and
 journalists are circumspect in their criticism of high
 officials. Criticism of certain government practices,
 inadequate services, and corrupt officials frequently
 occurs, although politically sensitive subjects are eschewed.
 Direct criticism of the President and his policies is a
 criminal offense. Instances of harassment and arrests of
 journalists are rare. Zairian journalists must be members
 of the state-controlled press union in order to practice
 their profession, so ouster from the union and consequent
 loss of one's livelihood is a serious threat. Journalists
 whose writings stray out of line are promptly instructed or
 reprimanded.
 There is no serious clandestine press. Popular theater and
 "radio trottoir" (sidewalk radio), fueled by rumor, gossip
 and speculation, constitute significant undercurrents of
 popular opinion and "news." Views which run contrary to the
 official party line are denied an outlet in the media.
 Artistic and academic freedom of expression are subject to
 the same restrictions and self-censorship as the press.
 Imported publications, including books and periodicals, are
 subject to censorship if they are critical of Zaire, and
 from time to time books and certain issues of magazines are
 banned. Mail is regularly opened by security services.
 Electronic surveillance is not normally used; the government
 security services rely heavily on informer networks.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Under the Constitution, all citizens are members of the
 sole political party, and only it and its subgroups
 may hold public meetings. The Government permits the
 existence of several non-political self-help ethnic associa-
 tions, but these groups have on occasion had meetings
 disrupted because of purported political activities. The
 
 
 356
 Government recognizes one labor union which is an extension
 of the MPR, and whose Secretary-General is a member of the
 MPR Central Committee. The nonconfrontational union
 is prohibited from organizing strikes. It can negotiate
 wage contracts and tends to concentrate its efforts on
 bread-and-butter issues. All workers employed in the public
 and private sectors are members of the party and employers
 pay the union two percent of total salaries for employee
 dues. The majority of workers (55 percent), however, are
 employed in unregulated small commerce and agriculture and,
 therefore, are not covered by the union. Zairian labor's
 relations with international labor organizations are not
 directed by the Government, but are consistent with general
 Zairian foreign policy goals.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 The Government officially sanctions most of the major world
 religions and has established procedures for new churches to
 obtain legal recognition. Virtually all Zairians are free
 to worship as they wish. Nearly 65 percent of Zaire's popula-
 tion is affiliated with Christian churches. Relations between
 the state and the Catholic Church--the only nationally-based
 institution not under the direct control of the party--remain
 cool and, at times, tense.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 In principle, any Zairian citizen may obtain a passport and
 exit visa. In practice, this process is sometimes delayed
 and impeded by underpaid officials. A married woman must
 have her husband's authorization before obtaining a passport,
 but once the document is issued she need not get her husband's
 approval to travel. If her husband is incapacitated in some
 way or refuses to authorize the passport, she can take her
 case to the courts, which are empowered to override a husband's
 denial. Travel within Zaire is generally unrestricted,
 although special permits are required in certain (mainly
 diamond mining) areas.
 The Government of Zaire's official estimate of the number
 of refugees to whom it provides safehaven is 300,000
 (215,000 Angolans, 22,000 Rwandans, 11,000 Burundians,
 50,000 Ugandans'and 1,800 Zambians). Since the Government
 permits refugees to seek employment and settle on farms,
 most are self-sufficient and integrated into the Zairian
 economic system within a few years of arrival. Zaire allows
 refugees access to all social services provided Zairian
 citizens. Since the declaration of general amnesty for
 refugees and political exiles in June 1978, some 200,000
 Zairians have been repatriated from Angola, Zambia, Europe,
 Sudan, and Tanzania. In 1982, the Government offered
 amnesty to, and is facilitating the resettlement of, some
 400 former rebels in Kivu Province, with some ICRC and US
 Government assistance.
 e. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Although the National Assembly and territorial assemblies
 have some legislative and administrative authority, the key
 
 
 357
 instruments of power remain highly centralized and controlled
 by President Mobutu. The Prime Minister and the Cabinet, as
 well as all governors and judges, are appointed by the Presi-
 dent. The Government of Zaire is in the process of creating
 a nationwide system of territorial assemblies in an effort
 to achieve a certain amount of administrative decentralization.
 The formation of additional political parties is constitution-
 ally barred. Thirteen ex-parliamentarians trying to organize
 a second political party were tried, convicted, and sentenced
 to 15 years imprisonment under the Zairian penal code of con-
 spiring to overthrow the Government. Suffrage is universal;
 by law, all eligible Zairian citizens are required to vote,
 and nonvoters are subject to arrest and fines.
 In 1982, direct, popular elections were held for municipal
 councils, for rural zonal councils, for urban zonal councils
 and for the national parliament. These were held as prescribed
 by the Constitution five years after the last such elections.
 The Government conducted an extensive and intensive campaign
 of voter information by television, radio, lectures, and the
 written media. Although all candidates were screened by the
 party's Central Committee, voters had a choice of candidates
 (an average of five per district) in the parliamentary
 elections. During the electoral campaigns, discussion of
 economic and political issues was restrained. Voter turnout
 was estimated at somewhat less than 50 percent.
 3. Government Attitude Regarding International and Non-
 governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations of
 Human Rights
 The Zairian Government made a greater effort during 1982 to
 cooperate with internationalhuman rights organizations and
 to improve Zaire's human rights image. President Mobutu
 personally met with an ICRC delegation early in the year.
 However, lower-level officials continued to respond slowly
 to instructions from the ministerial level to cooperate with
 ICRC. There were some prisoners accused of crimes against
 state security whom the ICRC was not able to see. Amnesty
 International remains concerned about reported detention
 without charge or trial of suspected opponents of the
 Government, the imprisonment of prisoners of conscience
 without fair trails, the administrative banishment of other
 prisoners of conscience, harsh prison conditions, and reports
 of torture and ill-treatment of prisoners.
 4. Economic, Social, and Cultural Situation
 Zaire is sub-Saharan Africa's second-largest country in
 area (over two million square kilometers) and third largest
 in population (about 30 million). With an annual population
 growth rate of two percent, the standard of living of the
 average citizen is lower today than in the 1960s and 1970s.
 Collapsing global demand, especially falling world mineral
 prices, rapidly rising import prices, heavy government
 expenditures on ill-conceived capital projects, the cumula-
 tive effects of policies which do not encourage growth, and
 corruption all have contributed to a dramatic deterioration
 in the Zairian economy and the Government's ability to
 rectify the situation. Real GDP growth was negative in the
 1975-1982 period, with per capital GDP in 1981 estimated at
 
 
 358
 $250 at the official exchange rate. The annual inflation
 rate was about 100 percent in 1979, and about 50 percent in
 both 1980 and 1981.
 Approximately 75 percent of the population is engaged primarly
 in subsistence agriculture. Industry operates at a maximum
 of only 30 to 40 percent capacity. Unemployment statistics
 are unreliable and probably misleading. Underemployment is
 the more serious problem, and the average urban family
 depends on petty commerce to make ends meet. Remuneration
 for productive activity in the public services sector is so
 inadequate that many civil servants must supplement their
 incomes through commercial activities. Low salaries and job
 insecurity have contributed to the institution of corruption
 in the Government and military with the result that unpaid
 or underpaid soldiers and gendarmes engage in petty harass-
 ment and extortion throughout the country.
 Because of low capital investment and maintenance, Zaire's
 basic infrastructure--particularly transportation, marketing
 and communications--has deteriorated steadily since indepen-
 dence in 1960. The absence of reliable and reasonably priced
 transport impedes the movement of agricultural products from
 food exporting areas (for example, Kivu Province in the east)
 to importing areas (for example, Kinshasa in the west).
 Unrealistic agricultural pricing policies, the high cost of
 transport and overall inflation make even the staple food
 (manioc) expensive for the average Zairian. Malnutrition,
 prevalent among both urban and rural inhabitants, is probably
 the single most serious health problem, contributing to high
 rates of illness and death from other causes. Life expectancy
 for the total population in 1980 was 47 years. Health care
 is curative rather than preventive and is extremely limited
 in quality and availability in both the urban and rural areas.
 The literacy rate in Zaire for persons over 15 varies
 regionally, but is about 58 percent nationwide with rates
 lower in rural areas and lowest for rural women. There are
 no concerted government programs to raise the adult literacy
 rate. There are only a quarter as many girls enrolled in
 primary schools as there are boys. Lack of books and
 supplies, high drop-out rates at all levels, and frequent
 teacher strikes have contributed to declining quality of
 education at all levels throughout the country. Unofficial
 regional and ethnic quotas in the university are designed to
 protect various ethnic groups from exclusion. Women's
 rights to own property and participate in the political and
 economic sectors are protected by law. However, married
 women must obtain their husband's authorization before
 opening a bank account, accepting a job, or renting or
 selling real estate. There is a growing number of women in
 the professions, government, and universities, and while the
 Government is focussing attention on the condition of women,
 their role is still somewhat restrained by custom.
