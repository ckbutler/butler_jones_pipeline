 CAMEROON
 Political power in Cameroon is heavily concentrated in the
 presidency. The President appoints all government and party
 officials and makes all major decisions, although key
 parliamentarians in the National Assembly and others have some
 behind-the-scenes influence. Cameroon had an active multiparty
 system when it became independent, but under former President
 Ahidjo, all parties were gradually consolidated into the
 Cameroon National Union, renamed in 1985 under President Paul
 Biya the Cameroon People's Democratic Movement (CPDM). Biya
 began a policy of democratizing the party structure in 1987 at
 the grass roots in preparation for multiple candidate municipal
 elections in 1987 and multiple candidate legislative elections
 in 1988.
 Internal security responsibilities are shared by the National
 Police (Surete National), the National Intelligence Service
 (Centre National Pour les Etudes et Recherche, CENER), the
 Ministry of Territorial Administration, Military Intelligence,
 and, to a lesser extent, the Presidential Security Service.
 The Ministry of Territorial Administration is in charge of
 prisons, and the National Police has the dominant role in
 enforcing internal security laws. The CENER and the military
 are still involved in both those functions, but to a lesser
 degree.
 Cameroon's economy remains strong, with a per capita gross
 domestic product ($1,130 in 1986) that places Cameroon among
 the middle-income developing countries. Nonetheless, it
 remains plagued by many problems of underdevelopment and its
 economy declined in 1987 as revenues from oil and other raw
 material exports fell. Cameroon's diversified agricultural
 base and the Government's conservative economic policies
 should help the country weather declining terms of trade and
 other external difficulties.
 During the 22 years of President Ahidjo's rule, Cameroon's
 diversity and the armed violence in some parts of the country
 were used to justify authoritarian control and harsh
 restrictions on civil liberties. In contrast, under President
 Biya the human rights environment has improved, but this
 progress was marred by two incidents in 1987 in which
 officials of the Cameroon Tribune, the Government's
 francophone daily, were detained. In both instances, the
 detainees were reportedly released by order of President
 Biya. By most estimates, 10 to 20 political detainees,
 holdovers from the arrests that followed the attempted 1984
 coup, remain in custody.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There were no reports of political killing.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reports of disappearance.
 
 
 39
 CAMEROON
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Torture is proscribed by the criminal code, which renders
 evidence obtained by torture inadmissible. In addition, the
 penal code prohibits public servants from using force against
 any person. However, very poor prison conditions, including
 inadequate food and sanitation, and limited medical facilities
 reqiain problems. Prisoners have reportedly suffered from
 severe malnutrition unless provided food by friends or
 families. Persons under "administrative detention" (i.e.,
 political detainees) are kept in special camps or prisons.
 Access to the administrative detention centers by families and.
 friends is severely restricted.
 4,,.Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, Exile, or Forced Labor
 Under Cameroonian law, a person arrested on suspicion of.
 committing an offense may not be held more than, 48 hours
 without a court order. This provision is generally observed.
 However, after.an investigating magistrate has determined that
 the case should be brought to trial and has issued a warrant
 to that effect, there is no limitation on how long the detainee
 may be..held in "preventive detention" pending trial. Accused
 persons-awaiting trial constitute the majority of..persons in
 the prisons at Yaounde andDouala. Release on bail is
 infrequent. The CENER does not bring its detainees before
 magistrates for investigation, as is the norm under the penal
 code.,,-;,,,.
 PersQflsqany be held in~administrative detention under
 legislation pertaining'to subversion. The penal code defines
 detention as the "loss of liberty for a political felony or
 misdemeanor." Such detention by regional authorities is
 initially for 1 month, renewable twice, and may be extended up
 to an additional 6 months by the Minister of Territorial
 Administration. Generally, those arrested and placed in
 administrat.Ve detention do not disappear--their families are
 told where they are, and.they are eventually released,
 although the detention may be lengthy. Political detainees,
 10 to 20 of whomare currently estimated to. be in custody, are
 usually held underthis type of detention. -Under state of
 emergency provisions, authorities may also order detention for
 up-.to 1-week for persons judged "dangerous to public security."
 The Minister of Territorial.Administration may also order
 detention'pf such persons for up tq 2 months; the order is
 renewable without limitation. The state of emergency
 provisions were not used in 1987.
 Locpal police occasionally harass citizens and threaten to.
 detain ".hem-unless bribes are paid. These actions are not
 condoned by high goyernment officials and have been sharply
 criticized by the President. In October 1987, the Secretary
 of. Statp for lnternalSecurity publicly reminded pol-ice that
 they..must not become criminals in enforcing the law and they
 must-enfirca it fairly..
 There are no reports 9f fprced labor being practiced in
 Cameroon.
 e- Denial of Fair Trial
 Trial by a presiding magistrate is guaranteed by law, and this
 practice is followed with the exception of persons held under
 asdministrative detention. Public trials are also guaranteed
 
 
 40
 CAMEROON
 by law, although exceptions are allowed for the public good or
 national security reasons. Trials which involve prominent
 persons or which are controversial are sometimes held in
 private. Magistrates in Cameroon are a corps of career civil
 servants responsible to the Minister of Justice and are
 required to have law degrees. Their decisions are generally
 not subject to government interference, and they are usually
 considered to conduct fair trials. There was an instance in
 1987, however, in which a magistrate was apparently the object
 of a retaliatory transfer after rendering a civil judgment
 against the Government. Defendants in felony cases are
 provided attorneys if they cannot afford one.
 Crimes involving subversion or illegal use of weapons, as well
 as crimes involving the military, are tried by military
 tribunal. Each tribunal has three members, and its presiding
 officer must be a magistrate and often is a military officer.
 As in civil cases, defendants are entitled to either public or
 private counsel.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Both invasions of the home and tampering with correspondence
 are violations of Cameroonian law. However, there are reports
 that police enter homes without warrants during periodic
 searches for criminals in low-income neighborhoods. Police
 officials also sometimes enter homes and demand to see
 receipts for household property as a customs law enforcement
 measure. Surveillance of suspected political dissidents,
 including monitoring of mail and of telephone conversations,
 is also common.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution of 1972 provides for the freedom of expression
 and press, but under Cameroonian law and practice these
 freedoms are restricted. No written ground rules exist, and
 the private press must submit each issue for censorship to see
 what is deemed acceptable and what is not. There is no
 evidence that anyone is punished for privately criticizing the
 Government, and freedom of public discussion exists to a degree
 that was unknown during the Ahidjo era. The private press
 continues to flourish, with close to 20 newspapers publishing
 on a regular schedule.
 Although no newspapers were closed during 1987, several
 incidents impinged upon the freedom of the Cameroonian press.
 In December 1986, the Minister of Justice criticized the press
 for considering itself a fourth branch of government,
 emphasized the need for state controls over the press, and
 warned of severe sanctions in the event of press misbehavior.
 In January 1987, two senior officials of the Cameroon Tribune,
 the government francophone journal, were arrested after the
 unauthorized publication of a presidential decree; the
 journalists were released over 1 month later but were
 subsequently fired. In March, three officials of the Cameroon
 Tribune were detained and interrogated by the CENER, Cameroon's
 security service, following the publication of an article
 about a conference on political literature held at the
 National University of Cameroon in Yaounde. In addition to
 the journalists, two academic participants were arrested and
 interrogated at the same time. As was the case in the earlier
 
 
 41
 CAMEROON
 incident, President Biya ordered the five detainees released
 when he learned of the arrests upon his return to Cameroon
 from a trip abroad.
 There has been increased editorial comment in the
 government-controlled press and radio, although the official
 journalists, bound by rules governing the behavior of civil
 servants,,enjoy much less latitude than do their private
 counterparts. Most official journalists are civil servants
 and can be transferred to less desirable jobs if they do not
 censor their own reporting. Cameroonian television has been
 on the air since December 1985, and although the television
 journalists seem to have more leeway to tackle sensitive
 social' issues and governmental corruption, they, like their
 printf and radio counterparts, practice self-censorship on
 controversial political issues.
 In past years, issues of international publications have been
 seized because they contained articles about Cameroon which
 the Government'considered inflammatory or defamatory.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The frepdoms of assembly and association, while provided for
 in the-Constitution, are restrictedoin practice and in law.
 The Caieroonian penal code prohibits public meetings,
 demonstrations, or processions without prior government
 approval, and organizations must register with the Government.
 The sole labor union, the Organization of Cameroonian Workers
 Union, <OCWU), operates within the framework of the official
 political party, and the top union .leadership is chosen by the
 Government. Pursuant to, its policy of democratization, the
 OCWU'permitted multiple candidates in the worker delegate
 electi9is in November, but OCWU retained the right to approve
 candidacies in advance. The union does qot play a major role
 in Cameroonian politics, although it has a membership of
 approximately 450,000 workers in a woring population of more
 than 3 million. It  ursues individual worker grievances and
 seeks improvements in government programs for worker safety
 and training.
 The OCWU participates in government-regulated labor
 negotiations, but strikes are illegal. Political activity by
 the trade union, excepting action designed to protect economic
 and other interests, is prohibited. The union maintains
 contact with foreign trade union organizations, notably the
 African-American Labor Center, but such contact requires
 government authorization. Cameroon is a member of the
 International Labor Organization (ILO), and rank and file
 union members comprise the labor component of the Cameroonian
 delegation to its meetings. The union is also a member of the
 Organization of African Trade Union Unity.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Freedom of religion is provided for in the Constitution and is
 generally respected. In order for a religious group to exist
 and function legally, it must be approved and registered with
 the Ministry of Territorial Administration. On at least one
 occasion, the Ministry rejected an application from a small
 religious group on the ground that it was too nearly identical
 to an existing group. Roughly 20 percent of Cameroonians are
 Muslim, 30 percent Christian, and the rest animist. Officials
 of tfie Government and party are drawn from members of all
 
 
 CAMEROON
 denominations. Missionaries played a major role in the
 development of Cameroon and continue to be active.
 However, the Jehovah's Witnesses, who do not acknowledge the
 supremacy of the state, were banned in 1970 and periodically
 have been targets of harassment since then, including
 imprisonment. In the most recent incident, a Jehovah's
 Witness, Augustine Kong, was reportedly sentenced to 2 years'
 imprisonment in June in an illegal border crossing case.
 Amnesty International, in its 1987 report (covering 1986)
 mentioned several specific cases involving the arrest of
 Jehovah's Witnesses, e.g., Andre Beygue Yakana, who was
 arrested in 1984 for attending an unofficial religious service
 in his home. Amnesty International adopted Yakana as a
 prisoner of conscience.
 Observance of traditional religions is not discouraged by the
 Government, although acts of witchcraft, magic, or divination
 "liable to disrupt public order or tranquility, or to harm
 persons or property" are outlawed with penalties of up to 10
 years' imprisonment.
 Independent Muslim and Christian publications exist in
 Cameroon, and there is no evidence that they are censored more
 heavily than the secular press.. The exception, again, is the
 Jehovah's Witnesses, who are not allowed to publish or
 distribute their religious materials.
 d. Freedom of Movement within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Freedom of movement within the country is not restricted by
 law. In practice, however, police frequently stop travelers
 to check identification documents as a security and immigration
 control measure. Exit visas are required to leave the country
 and sometimes are obtainable only after long bureaucratic
 delays. In some cases, these delays may represent attempts by
 the Government to discourage or even prevent departure. The
 Government has also been known to refuse issuance of a
 passport, or to confiscate an already issued passport, in
 order to prevent someone from traveling abroad. Cameroonians
 who leave the country must deposit sums sufficient to buy a
 return air ticket for repatriation should they become stranded
 abroad. There are no restrictions on voluntary repatriation.
 Women must obtain the permission of their husbands or fathers
 to leave the country.
 Over the years, Cameroon has served as a safehaven for
 thousands of displaced persons and refugees. The Government
 currently acknowledges the presence of approximately 50,000
 Chadians in Cameroon, some 7,500 of whom have been recognized
 by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR)
 as political refugees and are living at the UNHCR camp at Poli.
 The remaining Chadians have integrated into the Cameroonian
 economy and do not receive government or international
 assistance. Cameroon is also host to refugees from South
 Africa, Zaire, Angola, and other African nations, and there
 are approximately 100 Namibians in Cameroon as students.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Cameroon continues to be a one-party state with political
 power and administrative responsibility concentrated in the
 presidency. While the Constitution implies the legality of
 
 
 43
 CAMEROON
 other political parties, in fact, only one party, the CPDM, is
 currently permitted,.and therefore citizens cannot change the
 party in power through the electoral process. On June 26,
 1986, the Cameroon Supreme Court'ruled against the latest
 attempt by Dr. Joseph Sende to gain legal recognition for the
 Union des Populations du Cameroun (UPC), the second time under
 the Biya Government that the Supreme Court rejected Sende's
 plea. As before, the Court denied Sende on the ground that he
 is an active:member of the CPDM.. No one attempted to gain
 legal recognition of a second political party in 1987.
 Although-the election law theoretically permits multiple
 candidates for the presidency, President Biya ran unopposed in
 the January 1984 elections and received 99.98 percent of the
 votes. ThePresident appoints.all governors, prefects, and
 cahinet ministers.
 Cameroon's political system is a product of the country's
 ethnic and linguistic diversity, which includes some 230
 languages and 3 separate European traditions (French, British,
 and.German). Both French and English are official languages,
 although some Anglophones allege political discrimination by
 the majority Francophones. A careful balancing act, within
 the one party, is required to maintain political cohesion.
 Membership -in the CPDM is open to all religious and ethnic
 groups. While the-party remains essentially a centrally
 controlled organization, it is gradually broadening itself
 pursuant to the program adopted by..the 1985 CPDM Congress.
 Localtparty meetings held -throughout the country in 1986 were
 aimed at encouraging .the use of the party for two-way
 communication between the people, and the Government. The
 first open-municipal elections with,multiple candidacies were
 held on October 25, 1987, and a 1987 law provides for multiple
 candidacies for the ,1988 Natipnal Assembly elections as well.
 Externally based dissident groups, including the Union des
 Populationa.du Cameroun (Francophone) and the Cameroon
 Democratic. Party (Anglophone), periodically send letters or
 pamphlets Into the country. The Government attempts to seize
 these documents':when theyarrive. A number of former UPC
 members are now. active in the CPDM.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Under President Biya, the Government has given increased
 attention to human rights issues, both internally as a part of
 President Biya's program of "democratization" and in public
 statements in forums such as the United Nations.
 The Government of Cameroon does not publicly acknowledge or
 respond to investigations of alleged violations of human
 rights by nongovernmental organizations (e.g., Amnesty
 International).
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Access to the Government's social programs is open to all
 Cameroonian citizens on a nondiscriminatory basis. Girls made
 up 45.5 percent of elementary students in 1984-85, the last
 school year for which statistics are available. Women are
 underprivileged, both in access to higher education and in
 terms of professional opportunities. Girls from the southern
 part of the country, although disadvantaged at the secondary
 
 
 CAM4EROON
 education level when compared with boys from the same areas;
 have a considerable educational lead over girls and boys from
 the eastern and northern provinces. One of the goals of the
 sixth 5-year plan for economic, social, and cultural
 development is to improve educational opportunities for women.
 Women are promised equal rights under the Constitution and are
 politically active in the party and the sole labor union. The
 women's wing of the party has developed programs aimed at
 encouraging the economic and social productivity of
 Cameroonian women. Women are represented in the modern
 sector, although not proportionately in the upper levels of
 administration and in the professions. There are some women
 in the armed forces. There are currently five women in
 President Biya's Government but no women governors or prefects.
 As a result of the 1983 legislative elections, the percentage
 of women in the National Assembly increased from 10 to 14.
 CONDITIONS OF LABOR
 The Cameroonian National Labor Code sets the minimum working
 age at 14, the minimum annual paid vacation at 18 days, and
 the legal workweek at 40 hours for nonagricultural employees
 and up to 48 hours per week for agricultural workers. In
 order to make room for younger workers, civil servants are
 being encouraged to retire upon reaching the minimum
 retirement age of 55. Minimum monthly wages are set by the
 Government for all public and private sector jobs. Wage rates
 are based on geographic zones, types of industry, and
 qualifications of workers and length of service. The lowest
 wages are insufficient to support a family but, in most cases,
 they are supplemented by a second job or another family
 member's earnings. Workers with middle-range wages are also
 likely to need second incomes to support a family, especially
 in Yaounde and Douala. Because of Cameroon's relatively
 healthy economy, workers have opportunities to supplement
 their wages with second jobs. Occupational health and safety
 is mandated by law, based on ILO standards. In theory, these
 standards are enforced by inspectors of the Ministry of Labor,
 but they lack the means for effective enforcement.
