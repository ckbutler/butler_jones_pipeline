 BULGARIA
 Bulgaria is a parliamentary republic ruled by a democratically elected govern-
 ment. Following s election victory in late 1996 in the country's second direct presi-
 dential elections President Petar Styanov of the Union of Democratic Forces (DF)
 was inaugurated in January and began a 5-year term of office. At the beginning of
 1997, the Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP), heir to the Communist Party, and two
 nominal partners governed in a coalition. Widespread political unrest caused by a
 worsening economic crisis culminated in cripphmg nationwide strikes and daily
 antigoveroment protests in January and early February. Under mounting popular
 pressure, the BSP-led Government agreed in early February to hold early elections
 in April, in which the UUF-led coalition won an absolute majority in the National
 Assembly. UDF leader Ivan Kestov was chosen as Prime Minister. The judiciary is
 independent but continued to suffer from corruption and structural and staing
 problems.
 Most internal security services are the responsibility of the Ministry of the Inte-
 rior, which exercises incomplete control of the police, the Central Service for Com-
 bating Organized Crime, the National Security Service (civilian intelligence), inter-
 nal security troops, border guards, and special forces. The change of government
 brought a change in leadership and management of most of these services in some
 cases replacing security officials involved in the notorious State Security rganiza-
 tion      n as DS) and its repressive activtiies during the pre-1989 Communist re-
 gmem Both before and after the change in government, some members of the police
 force committed serious human rights abuses.
 The pest-Communist economy continued to be heavily dependent on money-losing
 state- enterpriesr although the                         Miwing private setor now accounts for about 45
 percent of ecoomic activity, an privatization is accelerating. Most people are em-
 ployed in the industrial and service sectors; key industries include food processing,
 chemical and oil processing, metallurgy, and-energy. Principal exports are agricul-
 tural products, cigarettes and tobacco, chemicals, and metal products. The trans-
 formation of the economy to a market-oriented system waso retarded by continued
 political and social resistance. Slow progress inthe privatization of the large Com-
 munist-era state enterprises was a major reason for economic stagnation in 1996.
 The failure to implement structural reforms led to an economic collapse in 1996 and
 early 1997. The financial stem stabilized after a brief hyperinflationary period
 after the switch to a caretacer government, but gross domestic product continued
 to decline through most of the year. The new Government announced its commit-
 ment to an accelerated privatization program. The service and consumer goods sec-
 tors in private hands continued to be the most active. The new Government intro-
 duced a currency board and implemented fical and monetary austerity, budget and
 staff cuts, and radical economic restructuring. The 1996 economic crisis affected the
 employment of ethnic minorities disproportionately. The annual per capita gross do-
 mestic product of $1,130 provides a relatively low standard of living.
 The Govenent generally respected the human rights of its citizens, but prob-
 lems remained in some areas. Police used unwarranted lethal force against suspects
 and minorities in some cases. Security forces beat suspects and inmates and at
 times arbitrarily arrested and detained persons. Government control of the police
 is not sufficiently complete to ensure full accountability. This results in a climate
 
 
 1010
 of impunity and inhibits government attempts to end police abuses. Conditions in
 some prisons are harsh, and pretrial detention is often prolonged. The judiciary is
 underpaid, understaffed, and has a heavy case backlog; corruption also exists. Con-
 stitutional restrictions on political parties formed on ethnic, racial, or religious lines
 effectively limit participation for some groups. Both the Government and private
 citizens continued to obstruct the activities of some nontraditional religious groups.
 Discrimination and violence against women remain serious problems, and some
 women are victims of trafficking and forced prostitution. Societal mistreatment of
 Roma is a serious problem. The limited social service system does not adequately
 assist homeless and other vulnerable children, notably Romani children. Further,
 security forces harass, physically abuse, and arbitrarily arrest and detain Romani
 street children.
 The National Assembly passed legislation, initiated by the new Government, to
 open the dossiers created by the former state security services to inspection both
 by a government commission and by private citizens. The Socialist opposition op-
 posed the law and challenged its legitimacy in the Constitutional Court; the Court,
 however, upheld its main provisions.
 The new Government placed a high priority on combating crime and corruption.
 It amended the Penal Code and the Property Insurance Act, inter alia, to expedite
 judicial processing, penalize organized crime and racketeering, increase rights of
 self-defense, provide for witness protection, permit and regulate government use of
 electronic surveillance and wiretapping to fight organized crime, and increase the
 severity of sentences for numerous serious crimes.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-Police officers used unwarranted le-
 thal force against criminal suspects, as well as against members of minority groups
 whether or not suspected of any crime, resulting in several deaths.
 On January 7, Stefan Stanev, age 50, died under unexplained circumstances while
 in custody at the police station of Popovo. Responding to pressure by human rights
 groups, the Military Prosecutor's Office began an investigation in June. To date no
 results have been released to the public.
 On February 2, a Plovdiv traffic police officer shot to death Elin Elenov
 Karamanov, a 29-year-old Rom from Plovdiv, under questionable circumstances.
 Karamanov had been with a friend who claimed that they were both looking for
 scrap iron near the Maritsa River when they suddenly noticed a policeman about
 100 feet away. The friend said that he ran away, but Karamanov remained. The
 next day, Karamanov's wife went to the police station, where she was told that an
 unidentified man had been killed. When she then went to the morgue she discovered
 her husband's remains. According to a forensic expert, the cause of death was a gun-
 shot wound to the head, behind the right ear. An investigation was under way at
 year's end.
 On February 18, a policeman, and a civilian hunter who came to the assistance
 of the police officer, shot Boris Vasilev Kalinov and Vasil Strahilov Kalinov, both
 Romani men, who were allegedly stealing cables. Boris Kalinov was wounded in the
 knee by the policeman, and Vasil Kalinov was shot to death from a distance of
 roughly 7 feet. Boris later denied resisting arrest. The policeman claimed that the
 two men were attacked by 14 Roma wielding pickaxes and shovels and had no other
 recourse than to use deadly force. An investigation was under way at year's end.
 The civilian who fatally shot Kalinov was accused of murder. The military prosecu-
 tor in Plovdiv started criminal proceedings, but no progress was reported by year's
 end.
 Following his arrest and possible mistreatment at the hands of police in Burgas
 in March, criminal suspect Georgi Biandov died in a hospital under suspicious cir-
 cumstances. No charges were brought in the case.
 Kolo Todorov, a 32-year-old Rom arrested in mid-May for theft, was reportedly
 shot and killed while trying to escape detention in Assenovgrad.
 On June 5, police in Sofia shot in the head a citizen of mixed-race parentage
 named Petar Robert Karandzha: He died the next day. The police claimed that he
 was shot while attempting to escape from investigative detention. The Bulgarian
 Helsinki Committee expressed concern that no evidence was presented that
 Karandzha had threatened others' lives or safety or that the police had exhausted
 other means of restraint. An internal investigation took place, and the police in-
 volved were exonerated.
 
 
 1011
 In mid-November Mincho Simeonov Surtmachev was apprehended as a robbery
 suspect and later died of wounds sustained from a severe beating while in police
 custody. A police officer was charged in the case.
 On January 29, 1996, a 17year-old Rom, Anguel Zabchikov, died while in police
 custody in Razgrad, apparently as a result of a beating. The plice told Zabchikov's
 family that he fell and fractured his skull while fleeing the poice and died instantly.
 The police later reported that he died as a result of excessive alcool in the blood-
 stream. In addition to the fractured skull, Zabchikov's family described numerous
 signs of severe beating and handcuff marks on both wrists. Criminal Rroceedings
 were terminated in 1997 by the Military Prosecutor's Office in Varna on the grounds
 that there had been no abuse committed by the police offiers involved. Following
 an appeal by Zabchikov's mother, the Regional (Civil) Prosecutor's Office in Razgrad
 initiated criminal proceedings, but on March 4 the investigation was suspended.
 However, the European Court of Human Rights agreed to try the case.
 No progress was registered in the case of the shooting death of former Prime Min-
 ister Andrei Lukanov in 1996. In the case of Ivan Benchev, who was beaten to death
 in 1996, one policemen was convicted. His appeal was pending at year's end.
 Due to public pressure from   human rights nongovernmental organizations
 (NGO's), charges were brought against the police officer accused of fatally shooting
 Orthodox priest Yordan Tsolov in 1994, although the trial had not begun by year's
 end.
 Interior Ministry data show 21 complaints of police brutality were filed in 1996,
 of which 3 were judged justified. For the period January through September 1997,
 24 such complaints were received of which 7 were considered to be of merit. The
 Ministry statistics reflect only those official complaints registered by the alleged vic-
 tims. Human rights NGO's report that they receive many more complaints from per-
 sons who are too intimidated to lodge an official complaint with government authori-
 ties. The Minister-of Interior in the new Government publicly acknowledged that
 abuses exist in the police force and announced his determination to bring offending
 police officers to justice. For example, he disbanded the renegade Special Police Unit
 in July after the unit attacked security personnel in a Sofia nightclub in a person-
 ally motivated vendetta (see Section l.c.). The police have generally refused to make
 investigative reports available to the public.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances;
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution expressly prohibits torture and cruel, inhuman, or degrading treat-
 ment. Despite this prohibition, police beat criminal suspects, members of minorities,
 and antigovernment demonstrators.
 According to a March report of the Council of Europe's Committee for the Preven-
 tion of Torture (CPT), "criminal suspects deprived of their liberty by the police in
 Bulgaria run a significant risk of being ill-treated at the time of their apprehension
 and/or while in police custody, and. . . on occasion resort may be had to severe ill-
 treatment/torture." The CPT delegation included medical professionals who exam-
 ined detainees and found evidence in the form of "physical marks or other medical
 conditions consistent with their allegations." The report further described conditions
 in National Investigative Service detention facilities as "almost without exception
 . . . inhuman and degrading."
 On January 10, the first day of nearly a month of daily public demonstrations
 against the BSP Government, a large crowd of antigovernment protesters broke
 through a police cordon and occupied the National Assembly building. Although
 there were reports of troublemakers among the crowd, the majority was nonviolent.
 During the early hours of January 11, special police units forcibly removed the dem-
 onstrators, resorting to the indiscriminate use of force. Former Prime Minister Filip
 Dimitrov -was among those severely beaten by police. The Bulgarian Helsinki Com-
 mittee reported that 295 people were injured, 11 of whom required inpatient hos-
 pitalization. Then-Minister of Interior Nikolai Dobrev announced an investigation,
 but no punishment was meted out by year's end. In January 1998, it emerged fol-
 lowing the publication of a previously classified tabinet meeting transcript that the
 order to use force against the demonstrators was issued by then-Prime Minister
 Zhan Videnov.
 In February masked police raided a Romani neighborhood in Pazardjik and beat
 local residents in what was seen as retaliation for the theft of food from a grocery
 earlier that day by several Romani protesters. The Human Rights Project reported
 that approximately 60 Romani citizens were beaten in the course of the raid. Ac-
 cording to family members, one man died in June as a result of improperly treated
 wounds received from the police during that incident. No criminal prosecution of
 those responsible for the mistreatment took place, although the district court agreed
 to consider civil claims.
 
 
 1012
 The Bulgarian Helsinki Committee also reported that in March police raided the
 "Flamingo, a Sofia bar run by gay rights activists. No warrant was produced, and
 Rpolice beat several of the bar's employees and patrons. The police allegedly con-
 fiscated documents and other items in an attempt to gain access to a list of those
 who frequent the Flamingo. They also reportedly kept several of those present dur-
 ing the raid in custody at a police station with their hands cuffed to a bar over their
 heads for 20 hours. None of those involved filed a formal complaint.
 Human Rights Project reported that in April two Romani theft suspects in
 Nedyalsko were handcuffed by police and tied to a tractor. The police, who had ear-
 lier beaten the suspects along with two others, forced the Roma to run after the
 tractor for approximately 1 kilometer. The police then drove the tractor (with the
 two Roma still attached) to the village square, where villagers stoned and beat the
 two men. The victims are preparing to file a complaint.
 In June a raid at an outdoor disco in Sofia resulted in 51 complaints of inappro-
 priate police behavior reported to the Bulgarian Helsinki Committee. Several offi-
 cers reportedly harassed and mistreated those patrons who did not produce identi-
 fication in a timely manner.
 On June 4 and 5, Danail Mladenov, a 23-year-old Rom from Valchedram was
 taken to a police station and questioned regarding a theft. Although police records
 indicated that he was not implicated in any theft, police officers allegedly attempted
 to obtain a confession by beating the soles of his feet (as well as his palms). His
 family asserted that he had visible injuries resulting from mistreatment. Mladenov
 filed a complaint with the Military Prosecutor's Office, but the prosecutor refused
 to initiate criminal proceedings.
 Also in June, several Sliven policemen beat theater director Zlatko Gulekov, alleg-
 edly for making excessive noise in public. Gulekov was reportedly beaten in a police
 station.
 Fifteen members of the Special Police Unit went to another Sofia nightclub in
 July to avenge the ejection of one of their colleagues the night before. According to
 news reports quoting security employees of the club, an officer was ejected the night
 before because he was intoxicated and behaving aggressively. The 15 officers se-
 verely beat several employees of the club, 3 of whom subsequently required hos-
 pitalization. Interior Minister Bogimil Bonev reacted quickly by disbanding the unit.
 Despite an announcement that those officers responsible would be turned over to
 the military prosecutor, to date no reports of further prosecution have emerged.
 Also in July, the families of three Romani  Is between the ages of 10 and 14
 accused the Elhovo police of brutality. They aeged thathe e police threatened the
 children with firearms, forced them to crawl on the ground while verbally abusing
 them with ethnic slurs, and then shapped the eldest and hit her with a truncheon.
 The girls were then reportedly intimidated into confessing to theft. The parents
 maintain that they were not informed of the detention of their daughters and have
 submitted a companttothe Military Prosecutor's Office in Sliven; no action was
 taken on the complaint by year's end.
 In September a loin, Ivo Karlovo, was arrested on suspicion of theft of a cow in
 Sopot. The police allegedly beat Karlovo with batons and metal wire and extin-
 guished a cigarette inhis palm while verbally abusing him with ethnic slurs. The
 Human Rights Project fied a complaint with the Military Prosecutor's Office but
 has yet to receive a reply.
 In October four police officers allegedly assaulted Roma in three cafes in Sofia's
 Hristo Botev neighborhood. Witnesses claimed that the officers, who were drunk,
 beat bystanders and forced a couple out of bed and then made them crawl naked
 on the floor. Yanko Atanassov and his son Nikolai told Human Rights Project per-
 sonnel that they were s                     attack. Yanko claimed to have been
 handcuffed and then beaten b the officers, and Nikolai said the policemen forced
 him to burn his father's enitals with a lighter.
 A Human Rights Watch report released in 1996 documenting police mistreatment
 of Romani street children stated that plice harass and physically abuse the chil-
 dren. Children described being chased, licked, and grabbed by police on the street.
 Conditions in some prisons are harsh, and iclude severe overcrowding, inadequate
 lavatory facilities, and insufficient heating and ventilation. Credible sources re-
 ported cases of brutality committed by prison guards against inmates; in some
 cases, prisoners who complained were placed in solitary confinement. The process
 by which prisoners may complain of substandard conditions or of mistreatment does
 not appear to function. Deputy Minister of Justice and Legal Euro-Integration
 Zlatka Rousseva visited 10 of Bulgaria's 13 prisons after taking office.
 The Government cooperated fully with requests by independent observers to mon-
 itor conditions in those prisons under the authority of the Ministry of Justice. Such
 
 
 1013
 
 cooperation was not the case for the detention centers operated by the National In-
 vestigative Service (see Section 1.d.).
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution provides for protection
 against arbitrary arrest and detention; however, police often arbitrarily detain
 street children. The Constitution provides for access to legal counsel from the time
 of detention. Police normally obtain a warrant from a prosecutor prior to apprehend-
 ing an individual; otherwise, in emergency circumstances judicial authorities must
 rule on the legality of a detention within 24 hours. Defendants have the right to
 visits by family members, to examine -evidence, and to know the charges against
 them. Charges may not be made public without the permission of the chief prosecu-
 tor. Pretrial detention is limited to 2 months under normal circumstances, although
 this may be extended to 6 months by order of the Chief Prosecutor, who may also
 restart the process. In practie persons are often detained for well over 6 months.
 In an August interview, Deputy Minister of Justice Rousseva said that people were
 known to have spent up to 4 years in prison without an indictment. Under the
 terms of an August amendment to the Code of Criminal Procedure, pretrial deten-
 tion for new detainees can last no more than 1 year or, if the alleged offense is pun-
 ishable by over 15 years' imprisonment, life imprisonment, or capital punishment,
 no more than 2 years.
 As of August 1, According to the Ministry of Justice, 1,516 inmates were in pre-,
 trial detention, 2,403 were on trial, and 7,857 had been convicted (for a total inmate
 population of 11,776). These figures do not include those held in custody by the Na-
 tional Investigative Service (NIS), for which figures are not available. The Bulgarian
 Helsinki Committee has attempted without success to gain access to NIS facilities
 in order to investigate allegations of abuse. Attempts to obtain information on the
 numbers held have also met with frustration.
 In the event of a conviction, time spent in pretrial detention is credited toward
 the sentence. The Constitution provides for bail, and some detainees have been re-
 leased under this provision, although bail is not widely used.
 A Human Rights Watch report in 1996 found that "police often arbitrarily detain
 street children, hold them in custody, question them, and then release them after
 registering the children with the Children's Pedagogic Office or referring them to
 a local Commission, the body which is authorized under the Juvenile Delinquency
 Act to recommend confinement of a child in a Labor Education School."
 The Government does not use forced exile.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-Under the Constitution the judiciary is granted
 independent and coequal status with the legislative and executive branches. How-
 ever, the judiciary continues to struggle with problems such as corruption, low sala-
 ries, understaffing, antiquated procedures, and a heavy backlog of cases. Partly as
 a legacy of communism and partly because of the court system's corruption, struc-
 tural, and personnel problems, many citizens have little confidence in the judicial
 system. Human rights groups complain that local prosecutors and magistrates some-
 times fail to pursue vigorously crimes-committed against minorities. Few organized
 crime figures have been prosecuted to date, but the new Government has made the
 battle against organized crime a priority and has reformed the Penal Code and
 sought external assistance to that end.
 The court system consists of regional courts, district courts, and Supreme Courts
 of Cassation (civil and criminal appeal) and Administration. The Government has
 not yet carried out several of the reforms provided for in a 1994 judicial reform bill,
 including revised procedures for the two separate Supreme Courts. The Constitu-
 tional Court, which is separate from the normal court system, is empowered to re-
 scind legislation it considers unconstitutional, settle disputes over the conduct of
 general elections, and resolve conflicts over the division of powers between the var-
 ious branches of government. Military courts handle cases involving military person-
 nel and some cases involving national security matters. The Constitutional Court
 does not have specific jurisdiction in matters of military justice. Judges are ap-
 pointed by the 25-member Supreme Judicial Council and, after serving for 3 years,
 may not be replaced except under limited, specified circumstances. The 12 justices
 on the Constitutional Court are chosen for 9-year terms as follows: a third are elect-
 ed by the National Assembly, a third appointed by the President, and a third elected
 by judicial authorities.
 The Constitution stipulates that all courts shall conduct their hearings in public
 unless the proceedings involve state security or national secrets. There were no re-
 ported complaints about limited access to courtroom proceedings. Defendants have
 the right to learn of the charges against them and are given ample time to prepare
 a defense. The right of appeal is provided and widely used. Defendants in criminal
 proceedings have the right to confront witnesses and to have an attorney, provided
 by the state if necessary, in serious cases.
 
 
 1014
 
 Human rights observers consider so-called "Educational Boarding Schools" (for-
 merly known as "Labor Education Schools ") to which problem children can be sent
 to be little different from penal institutions. However, since the schools are not con-
 sidered prisons under the law, the procedures by which children are confined in
 these schools are not subject to minimal due process. This denial of due process is
 criticized by human rights observer groups such as the Bulgarian Lawyers for
 Human Rights. Children sometimes appear alone despite the requirement that par-
 ents attend hearings; the right to an attorney at the hearing is expressly prohibited
 by law. Decisions on these cases are not subject to judicial review, and chi dren typi-
 cally stay in the Educational Boarding Schools for 3 years or until they reach major-
 ity age, whichever occurs first. In late 1996, the National Assembly enacted legisla-
 tion providing for court review of sentencing to such schools, setting a limit of a 3-
 year stay, and addressing other problems in these institutions (see Section 5). Some
 observers dismiss these provisions as a formality, as the child is not present to
 speak on his or her own behalf (nor is the defense lawyer, nor the child's parents).
 Until September former dictator Todor Zhivkov remained under house arrest on
 charges stemming from his involvement in the coercive campaign to rename and as-
 simiate ethnic T~urks in the mid-1980's, channeing funds to arm third-world coun-
 tries, and estabishing a fund to assist leftist workers' organizations worldwide.
 Zbivkov was granted a temporary release in August in order to attend a function
 in h~is honor. In September the Miitary Prosecutor's Office released Zhivkov from
 house arrest but imposed parole-like conditions that require him to report regularly
 to the police and forbid him from leaving the country.
 One of the primary figures in a long-running case involving the prosecution of
 former high-level Communists for various financial misdeeds, former Prime Minister
 and one-time senior Communist official Andrei Lukanov, brought a complaint
 against these proceedings to the European Commission of Human Rights. In 1996
 the Commission ruled that the detention of Lukanov from July to December 1992
 was unlawful. Although Lukanov was shot and killed in Sofia on October 2, 1996,
 the European Court of Human Rights found in Lukanov's favor in March and or-
 dered the Government to pay damages, legal costs, and expenses to Lukanov's next-
 of-kin. The Government complied.
 There was no progress in a case begun in 1993 relating to the forced assimilation
 and expulsion of ethnic Turks in 1984-85 and 1989, nor in a trial relating to the
 notorious death camps set up by the Communists after they came to power in 1944.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution provides for the inviolability of the home, the right to choose one's
 place of work and residence, and the freedom and confidentiality of correspondence.
 Human rights observers expressed concern that illegal wiretaps may persist; specu-
 lation was fueled by an incident in January when, immediately after a journalist
 revealed in a telephone conversation his possession of a videotape allegedly incrimi-
 nating the security services in police brutality, the police arrived at his home and
 confiscated the tape. Procedures were subsequently introduced by the Government
 that are designed to prevent the abuse of legal wiretaps by the security forces.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech
 and of the press, and the Government generally respects this right in practice. In
 1996 the National Assembly passed, over President Zhelev's veto, legislation that
 was publicly criticized by Council of Europe experts and Bulgarian journalists for
 the inhibitions it would impose on freedom of the broadcast media. Critics of the
 media law were concerned, for example, that the makeup of the National Council
 for Radio and Television would subject the media to political influence by the party
 in power. Asked by 74 opposition Members of Parliament to rule on the law, the
 Constitutional Court in November 1996 declared this and numerous other provisions
 unconstitutional. Until a revised bill is enacted, the broadcast media are left in a
 legislative void but operate freely. Meanwhile the Government appointed a new Na-
 tional Council.
 A variety of newspapers are published freely by political parties and other organi-
 zations representing the full spectrum of political opinion, although journalists fre-
 quently color their reports to conform with the views of the political parties or eco-
 nomic groups that own their respective newspapers.
 Some human rights observers charge that prosecutors use their authority to issue
 arrest warrants to intimidate reporters who criticize their work. However, only one
 case apparently occurred during the year, when journalist Yovka Atanassova was
 convicted in March of allegedly libeling prominent business and political figures
 whom she reported had worked as State Security Organization informants. Another
 
 
 1015
 
 Journalist was released from prison after serving the full term of a 6-month sentence
 begun in 1996; he was convicted of libel for accusing a prosecutor of corruption.
 Pending enactment of the new media legislation, national television and radio
 broadcasting both remained under parliamentary supervision. Some media observ-
 ers expressed concern that such parliamentary supervision fosters censorship and
 a lack of balance in the state-controlled media. After confidential records of his gov-
 ernment were made public in January 1998, it emerged that Socialist Prime Min-
 ister Zhan Videnov restricted the national television network's coverage of
 antigovernment demonstrations in January 1997.
 There are two state-owned national television channels that broadcast in Bul-
 garian. Until the end of August, there was also a national channel that broadcast
 ussian programming and another that carried a mixture of Cable News Network
 International and French-language programming. All foreign broadcasts ended in
 the autumn when previously-granted broadcast licenses expired. Bulgarian National
 Television has been planning Turkish-language programming for at least 4 years,
 but broadcasts have not yet begun (there are, however, two daily half-hour radio
 broadcasts in Turkish). There is no private national broadcast station, but a number
 of privately owned regional stations operate. After initial government approval in
 the fall of 1994 of an application to create a privately owned national broadcast tele-
 vision station, no further steps have been taken by either the current or previous
 governments to license such a station.
 Foreign government radio programs such as the British Broadcasting Corporation,
 Deutsche Welle, and the Voice of America had good access to commercial radio fre-
 quencies. Television and radio news programs on the state-owned media present op-
 position views, but opposition members claim that their activities and views are
 given less air time and exposure than the those of the ruling party. There are no
 formal restrictions on programming. Both television and radio provide a variety of
 news and public interest programming, including talk and public opinion shows.
 More than 30 independent radio stations are licensed. Some private stations com-
 plained that their licenses unduly restricted the strength of their transmissions in
 comparison with state-owned stations. Radio transmitter facilities are owned by the
 Government.
 Private book publishing remained unhindered by political considerations, but pub-
 lishers suffered heavy losses as a result of the economic crisis. Additionally, many
 publishing houses are small and operate on slender profit margins.
 The Government respects academic freedom.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The right to peaceful assembly
 is provided for by the Constitution, and the Government generally respected this
 right in practice. The authorities require permits for rallies and assemblies held out-
 doors, but most legally registered organizations were routinely granted permission
 to assemble. However, on several occasions police broke up gatherings and services
 of unregistered religious groups, including those of Jehovah's Witnesses, Word of
 Life, The Unification Church, and Baha'is. These religious groups were denied reg-
 istration by the Council of Ministers. The Government also broke up a Muslim reli-
 gious gathering in August; although the Muslim religion is recognized and sub-
 sidized by the State, this particular gathering was deemed "nonauthorized" (see Sec-
 tion 2.c.).
 Vigorous political rallies and demonstrations were a common occurrence. Most
 took place without government interference, with the notable exception of the con-
 troversial events at the National Assembly building on January 10 and 11 (see Sec-
 tion 1..).
 The Government has undertaken to respect the rights of individuals and groups
 freely to establish their own political parties or other political organizations. How-
 ever, there are constitutional and statutory restrictions that limit the right of asso-
 ciation and meaningful participation in the political process. For example, the Con-
 stitution forbids the formation of political parties along religious, ethnic, or racial
 lines and prohibits "citizens' associations" from engaging in political activity. This
 provision is designed to prevent the development of parties based on a single ethnic
 or other group that could prove divisive for national unity by stirring up ethnic ten-
 sion for political purposes. Nonetheless, the mainly ethnic Turkish Movement for
 Rights and Freedoms (MRF) is represented in the National Assembly. The other
 major political parties generally accept the MRF's right to participate in the political
 process.
 The Constitution also prohibits organizations that threaten the country's terri-
 torial integrity or unity or that incite racial, ethnic, or religious hatred. The Govern-
 ment has refused since 1990 to register a self-proclaimed Macedonian rights group,
 Omo-Ilinden, on the grounds that it is separatist. In April and again in May, police
 
 
 1016
 
 broke up attempts by the group to hold public meetings. There were no known pros-
 ecutions for simple membership in this group.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-Although the Constitution provides for freedom of reli-
 gion, the Government restricts this right in practice for some non-Orthodox religious
 groups. The ability of a number of religious groups to operate freely continued to
 come under attack, both as a result of government action and because of public in-
 tolerance. The government requirement that groups whose activities have a reli-
 gious element register with the Council of Ministers remained an obstacle to the ac-
 tivity of-some religious groups, such as Jehovah's Witnesses, Word of Life, the Unifi-
 cation-Church, and- Baha'is, which have been denied registration. In December the
 Directorate of Religious Affairs registered the "United Evangelical Churches," an al-
 liance of five evangelical churches, and in August it registered the Gideons as a "re-
 ligos group."
 7he Ministry of Education announced plans to include a course on religion in the
 high school curriculum beginning with the 1998-99 school year. The plan reportedly
 calls for a "world religion" course that avoids endorsing any particular faith.
 The Government refused many requests for visas and residence permits for for-
 eign missionaries, some of whom came under physical attack in public places. Mem-
 bers of the Mormon Church reported continued acts of harassment and assault, in-
 cluding some perpetrated by government authorities themselves. Two groups of
 Mormon missionaries were singled out for extensive searches and had religious and
 other literature as well as personal belongings confiscated at Sofia Airport in April.
 At no point did the customs officials cite any law that.would have been breached
 by the importation or possession of the Mormons' -literature but insisted that they
 - were acting under orders from their superiors. When one missionary was later ad-
 -vised that the items could be retrieved at the airport, he was arrested for alleged
 possession of methamphetamines which, according to customs authorities, were con-
 tained in over-the-counter dietary supplements that were removed from the mission-
 aries' luggage at the time of confiscation. The Minister of Interior acted promptly
 to obtain his release. A criminal investigation is still pending.
 In late 1995, Jehovah's Witnesses brought a complaint to the European Commis-
 sion of Human Rights about the Government's refusal to register the organization.
 'The Commission ruled that Jehovah's Witnesses' appeal was admissible before the
 Commission, and the Government subsequently indicated in the press that it might
 be willing to come to terms out of court with Jehovah's Witnesses on those practices
 that the Government has considered objectionable. Talks were continuing between
 the two parties at year's end. Proposed legislation allowing alternatives to compul-
 sory military service provided a possible oportunity for agreement. One member of
 Jehovah's Witnesses who was imprisoned or refusing to serve in the military was
 released in 1997. Another member of Jehovah's Witnesses, an Austrian citizen, was
 ordered to leave the country in September.
 On several occasions the police shut down religious meetings of unregistered
 groups. In April and August, police broke up Word of Life religious gatherings, and
 in May customs officials at Sofia Airport confiscated videotapes belonging to the
 same religious group. In April and in June, police broke up meetings of the Unifica-
 tion Church and confiscated literature and other items. In May two members of Je-
 hovah's Witnesses in Petrich were beaten and driven out of town by local members
 of the political party "Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization." No action
 was taen by law enforcement authorities. In June police broke up a Jehovah's Wit-
 ness gathering in Plovdiv and confiscated religious materials. In August police en-
 tered the home of a Jehovah's Witness member to break up a religious gathering,
 confiscated religious materials, books, and personal videos, and filmed those present
 at the meeting. Also in August, Haskovo municipal authorities banned a public
 meeting of Baha'is and forced them to abandon an apartment in the city. Later in
 August, police raided an Islamic religious seminar on the grounds that it was not
 registered. On this occasion, the police brought cameramen with them who recorded
 the raid for broadcast on national television news. These incidents lend credence to
 charges by human rights activists that the police are monitoring and interfering
 with the activities of many unregistered groups.
 The Constitution designates Eastern Orthodox Christianity as the "traditional" re-
 ligion. Along with the Orthodox Church, a number of major religious bodies, includ-
 ing the Muslim and Jewish communities, receive government financial support.
 There was no evidence that the Government discriminated against the members of
 any reliious roup in making restitution to previous owners of properties that were
 nationaized duing the Communist regime. The Government actively supported
 property restitution for a group representing the Jewish community. For most reg-
 istered religious groups, there were no restrictions on attendance at religious serv-
 ices or on private religious instruction. A school for imams, a Muslim cultural cen-
 
 
 1017
 ter, university theological faculties, and religious primary schools operated freely.
 Bibles and other religious materials in the Bulgarian language were on most occa-
 sions freely imported and printed, and Muslim, Catholic, and Jewish publications
 were published on a regular basis. Nevertheless, police confiscated religious lit-
 erature during searches of Mormon missionaries, a visiting Word of Life minister,
 and Jehovah's Witnesses.
 In September three Bulgarian Socialist Party members of Parliament proposed
 the levying of fines against those leaders of religious groups who have been denied
 registration yet continue to perform religious ceremonies. The fines would range
 from $56 to $560 (100,000 to 1 million Leva).
 During compulsory military service most Muslims are placed in construction units
 where they often perform commercial or maintenance work rather than serve in nor-
 mal military units. The mainly ethnic Turkish Movement for Rights and Freedoms
 (MRF) protested this practice (see Section 5).
 A long-running feud in the Muslim community ended in October. Until then many
 Muslims viewed the Government's recognition of Nedim Gendjev as Chief Mufti to
 be interference in their affairs. Many members of the ethnic Turkish minority
 viewed Gendjev as a collaborator with the "Regeneration Process" of the Zhivkov re-
 gime in the 1980's, during which many ethnic-Turkish citizens were intimidated
 into exchanging their Turkish names for Bulgarian ones. The Government continued
 to refuse to recognize the election of a rival Chief Mufti, Fikri Sali, who was elected
 at an alternative Islamic conference in 1995. In late October, the leadership of the
 Muslim community participated in a unification conference organized by the Gov-
 ernment and elected a new Mufti, Mustafa Alish Hadji, who was found acceptable
 by the majority of supporters of both former rival muftis. The Government there-
 upon registere both adji and the new statutes of the Muslim leadership as adopt-
 ed by the conference.
 At the Department of Theology of Sofia University all students are required to
 present a certificate of baptism from the Orthodox Church, and married couples
 must present a marriage certificate from the same in order to enroll in the Depart-
 ment's classes; in 1996 two non-Orthodox applicants were denied admission to the
 Department when they were unable to present such certificates. The applicants then
 appealed to the local courts. One local court has already decided in favor of one ap-
 plicant.
 The schism that opened in the Orthodox Church in 1992 continued, and the Gov-
 ernment refused to recognize an alternative Patriarch elected by his supporters in
 1996. The Supreme Court ruled that the decision was unlawful, but the alternate
 Patriarch remained unregistered by the new Government.
 d- Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Constitution provides for freedom of movement within the country
 and the right to leave it, and these rights are not limited in practice, with the excep-
 tion of limited border zones that are off limits both to foreigners and citizens not
 resident therein. Every citizen has the right to return to Bulgaria, may not be forc-
 ibly expatriated, and may not be deprived of citizenship acquired by birth. A num-
 ber of former political emigrants were granted passports and returned to visit or
 live. The new Government revoked the passports of several former government fig-
 ures who were under investigation for chargs of corruption.
 Bulgaria has provisions for granting asylum or refugee status in accordance with
 relevant United Nations acts in this field, and the Government provides first asy-
 lum. However, domestic and international human rights organizations expressed
 concern over the Government's handling of asylum claims and reported that there
 may be cases in which bona fide refugees are forced to return to countries where
 they fear persecution. In the absence of a refugee law, the procedures followed by
 the Government's National Bureau for Territorial Asylum and Refugees (NBTAR)
 are regulated by an Ordinance for Granting and Regulating Refugee Status. The
 NBTAR is currently drafting a proposed refugee law, which has yet to be submitted
 to the National Assembly. The NBTAR asserts that it gives a fair hearing to all per-
 sons seeking asylum or refugee status but admits that there may be cases that do
 not come to its attention before the applicants are returned to the country from
 which they came. In 1996 the Ministry of Interior reported that 2,600 people were
 denied entry at borders over the past few years. It is not known how many of these
 persons requested asylum; no figures for 1997 were available.
 The NBTAR reports that, from its inception in 1993 until August 31, a total of
 1,798 people applied for asylum. Of these cases, 341 persons were granted asylum,
 73 were denied, and for 186 applicants the procedure was terminated (usually be-
 cause the applicant could not be found). Domestic and international human rights
 organizations complained that the asylum process is slow (it can take up to 4 years),
 and that many of those who have been granted refugee status have yet to receive
 
 
 1018
 
 the necessary documents enabling them to move about freely and work. Due to the
 arrival of only a relatively low number of refugees, the NBTAR is no longer seeking
 to establish reception centers (blocked in 1994 by skinheads and local citizens
 groups) but still plans to open transit centers.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens have the right to change their government and head of state through the
 election of the President and of the members of the National Assembly, although
 the constitutional prohibition of parties formed on ethnic, racial, or religious lines
 has the effect of circumscribing access to the political process for some groups (see
 Section 2.b.). Suffrage is universal at the age of 18.
 Citizens exercised the right to change their government in April. Popular unrest
 in the form of general strikes and daily protests during the -political crisis of Janu-
 ary and early February led to a political capitulation by an extremely unpopular
 and widely discredited government and agreement to move immediately to new elec-
 tions. The populace believed that the Government, dominated by the Bulgarian So-
 cialist Party, bore the brunt of the blame for the economic malaise that began with
 the banking crisis in the spring of 1996 and worsened with the collapse of the na-
 tional currency (Lev) in late 1996 and early 1997. The Government bowed to popu-
 lar pressure and agreed on February 4 to allow President Petar Stoyanov (who was
 elected in late 1996 and took office in January) of the United Democratic Forces to
 select a caretaker government in p reparation for early parliamentary elections in
 April. Free and fair elections, which were observed by international monitors, were
 held on April 19, and resulted in an absolute majority for the UDF. UDF parliamen-
 tary group leader (and former opposition leader) Ivan Kostov was chosen by his
 party as Prime Minister.
 There are no restrictions in law on the participation of women in government. A
 number of women hold elective and appointive office at high levels, including three
 cabinet-levelposts and several key positions in the National Assembly. The Minister
 of Foreign Affairs and the leader of the UDF parliament    group (the dominant
 party in thenew Government) are both women. Women hold just under 11 percent
 of the seats in the National Assembly.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Local and international human rights groups operate freely, investigating and
 publishing their findings on human rights cases. Local human rights roups did not
 report significant improvement in their dealings with government officials. Govern-
 ment officials, especially local officials, are occasionally reluctant to provide informa-
 tion or active cooperation. The failure of the National Investigative Service to allow
 access by human rights groups to its detention centers is of particular concern.
 Sectioh 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution provides for individual rights, equality, and protection against
 discrimination, but in practice discrimination still exists, particularly against Roma
 and women.
 There have been reports of inadequate police response to incidents of societal vio-
 lence against homosexuals, but few victims of such assaults are willing to press
 charges. Police also beat homosexuals during one incident in March (see Section
 2.c.).
 Women.-Domestic abuse is a serious and common problem, but there are no offi-
 cial statistics on its occurrence. The Animus Association (AA), a nongovernmental
 organization that offers help and support to female victims of violence, reported 65
 cases of-domestic violence and 5 cases of trafficking in women between May 1996
 and September 1, 1997. The actual incidence of each is certainly much higher, as
 these represent those cases in which the victim (or, in some trafficking cases, an
 overseas women's group) was willing and able to contact Animus.
 Currently the law exempts from state prosecution certain types of assault if com-
 mitted by a family member, and the Government does not assist in prosecuting
 crimes of domestic assault unless the woman has been killed or permanently in-
 jured The courts prosecute rape, although it remains an underreported crime be-
 cause some stigma still attaches to the victim. The maximum sentence for rape is
 8 years; convicted offenders often receive a lesser sentence or early parole. Ministry
 of Interior figures reveal that from January through April, 14 women were mur-
 dered, 14 were victims of attempted murder, 53 suffered serious injuries, 119 were
 reported raped, and 16 were reported as victims of attempted rape. Marital rape is
 a crime but is rarely prosecuted. Courts and prosecutors tend to view domestic
 
 
 1019
 abuse as a family rather than a criminal problem, and in most cases victims of do-
 mestic violence take refuge with family or friends rather than approach the authori-
 ties. No government agencies provide shelter or counseling for such persons, al-
 though there is a private initiative to address the problem.
 In 1997 the Government for the first time enacted a law against trafficking in
 women. Several cases of trafficking in women were uncovered between May 1996
 and September 1997. The AA reports that, according to foreign women's organiza-
 tions, Bulgarian women comprise the fourth largest group of victims of forced pros-
 titution in Western and Central Europe. Typically, the women are lured away with
 offers of overseas jobs as nannies, waitresses, dancers, shop assistants, or fruit-pick-
 ers and are surprised to discover that virtual indentured servitude in prostitution
 awaits them. The AA also reports that the most common destination for such
 women is Cyprus, but that Greece, Turkey, Italy, Germany, Poland, Belgium, the
 Netherlands, the Czech Republic, and Macedonia have all een used either for the
 transit or "sale" of victims. One victim alleged that the police were involved in traf-
 ficking her in the town of Petrich, although this report has not been confirmed.
 Women have reportedly been lured into Bulgaria from the former Soviet Union and
 Macedonia, also for forced prostitution.
 Many of the approximately 30 women's organizations are closely associated with
 political parties or have primarily professional agendas. Some observers believe that
 women's organizations tend to be associated with political parties or professional
 groups because feminism in itself has negative connotations in Bulgarian society. Of
 those that exist mainly to defend women's interests, the two largest are the Wom-
 en's Democratic Union in Bulgaria, heir to the group that existed under the Com-
 munist dictatorship, and the Bulgarian Women's Association, which disappeared
 under communism but has now reemerged and has chapters in a number of cities.
 The Constitution forbids privileges or restrictions of rights on the basis of sex.
 However, women face discrimination both in terms of recruitment and the likelihood
 of layoffs. Official figres show the rate of unemployment for women to be higher
 than that for men. women are much more likely than men to be employed in low-
 wage jobs requiring little education, although statistics show that women are equal-
 ly likely to attend university Women, in the main, continue to have primary respon-
 sibility for child rearing and housekeeping even if they are employed outside the
 home. There are liberal provisions for paid maternity leave.
 Children.-The Government is enerally committed to protecting children's wel-
 fare but, with limited resources, faels short in several areas. It maintains, for exam-
 pIe, a sizable network of orphanages throughout the country. However, many are
 indisrepair and lack proper facilities. Government efforts in' education and health
 have been constrained by serious budgetary limitations and by outmoded social care
 structures. The Constitution provides for mandatory school attendance until the age
 of 16. Groups that exist to defend the rights of children charge that an increasing
 number of chiildren are at serious risk as social insurance payments fall further be-
 hind inflation and are often disbursed as much as 6 months late; this situation was
 compounded in the early months of the year when the Lev was losing value rapidly.
 The most egregious example of neglect occurred at the Home for Mental  Handi-
 capped Children in Djurkovo, where seven children died from manutrition and
 hypothermia in January and February. Accordingto Amnesty International, 9-year-
 old Angelina Atanasva weighed 7 kilograms (15/2 pounds) when she died on Feb-
 ruary 25, and 18-year-old Diana Dechkova weighed 11 kilograms (24 pounds) when
 she died 2 days later.
 There is apparently no provision for due process of law for Romani and other juve-
 niles when they are detained in Labor Education Schools run by the Ministry of
 Education (MOE). Living conditions at these reform schools are poor, offering little
 medical, educational, or social opportunities. Generally, staff members at these in-
 stitutions lack the proper qualifications and training to adequately care for the chil-
 dren. Degrading and severe punishment, such as the shaving of a child's head, re-
 duction in diet, severe beatings, and long periods of solitary confinement, are com-
 mon at the schools. In 1996 the MOE acknowledged problems at the schools, attrib-
 uting the cause to a lack of funding. In late 1996, the National Assembly enacted
 ledcation providing for court review of sentencing to such schools and addressing
 other problems in the reform school system (see Section i.e.).
 The vast majority of children are free from societal abuse, although some Romani
 children are frequent targets of skinhead groups; homeless or abandoned children
 were particularly vulnerable. Some Romam minors were forced into prostitution by
 family or community members. Little police effort was expended to address these
 problems. New legislation calls for the establishment of shelters for homelesas chil-
 dren.
 
 
 1020
 
 People With Disabilities.-Disabled persons receive a range of financial assistance
 includ   ree public transportation, reduced prices on modified automobiles, and
 free equipment such as wheelchairs. However, as in other areas, budgetary con-
 straints mean that such payments have fallen behind. Disabled individuals have ac-
 cess to university training and to housing and employment, although no special pro-
 srans are in place to allow them to live up to their full employment potential. To
 date little effort has been made at the national level to change building or street
 layouts to help blind or otherwise physically disabled persons. A pilot project for
 minibus transportation of people with disabilities began operation in December in
 six major cities.
 In 1995 the National Assembly passed legislation requiring the relevant ministry
 and local governments to provide a suitable   an aritectral environment for
 the disabled within 3 years. However, a moratorium on the law continues until the
 Ministry of Construction has completed issuing new construction standards that
 more fully take into account the needs of the disabled. The Union of Disabled People
 in Bulgaria reports that minor improvements (i.e., ramps in hospitals) are being
 made on a local level in some areas. Policies of the Communist regime, which sepa-
 rated mentally and physically disabled persons, including very young children, from
 the rest of society have persisted.
 Religious Minorities.-Discrimination, harassment, and general public intolerance
 of "nontraditional" religious minorities (i.e., the great majority of Protestant Cbris-
 tian religions) remained a problem. Deep-rooted suspicion of Evangelical denomina-
 tions among the populace is widespread and pervasive across the political spectrum.
 Often cloaked in a veneer of "patriotism," a lack of tolerance for the religious beliefs
 of others enjoys significant popularity, and mainstream public pressure for contain-
 ment of "forein religious sects" inevitably influences plicymakers.
 An Evangelical Congress held in May in Sofia was greeted with an outpouring of
 hostility. A purported provocative comment by a visiting American pastor (who al-
 legedy referred to Bulgarians as "pagans ") triggered demonstrations by clergy of
 the Bulgarian Orthodox Church, certain political parties, University of Sofia theol-
 ogy students, and other students who joined the theology students in a gesture of
 solidarity. Bulgarian  Patriarch Maxim referred to the Evangelicalss "traitors of
 faith and country." Orthodox riests were among the most militant protesters, en-
 gaging in disorderly conduct that tried the patience of riot police on the scene. In
 one instance, plice were seen to react quickly in defense of four Evangelical church-
 goers when mob behavior threatened their safety. One newspaper ran a story during
 the Evangelical Congress in which an apparently gratuitous link was made between
 the suicide of a 15-year-old by and "the influence of a sect." Chief prosecutor Ivan
 Tatarchev later commented that the May Evangelical Congress "should have been
 banned." The Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization (a political party
 represented in the governing coalition, with two seats in the National Assembly)
 also condemned Evangelical groups. In the face of this religious harassment, not a
 single Bulgarian politician spoke out in favor of the right of all citizens t worship
 according to their own beliefs.
 Numerous articles in a broad range of newspapers depicted lurid and inaccurate
 pictures of the activities of non-Orthodox religious groups, attributing the breakup
 of families to the practices of these groups.
 Groups denied registration such as Word of Life and Jehovah's Witnesses faced
 discriminatory practices (see Sections 2.b. and 2.c.), as did registered groups which,
 despite full compliance with the law, were greeted withdhostility by the press, pub-
 lic, and certain government officials.pMormon missionaries reported numerous inci-
 dents of both official and private harassment, most notably by customs officers (see
 Section .2.c.). They were also assaulted on occasion. The police took no action when
 two members of Jehovah's Witnesses were beaten in Petrich in May (see Section
 2.c.).
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minoriiies.-Ethnic~ Turks comprise almost 10 percent of
 the population. Although estimates of the Romani population vary widely, several
 experts put it at about 6 percent. (Bulgarian Muslims or "Pomaks" are a distinct
 group of Slavic descent, omprising 2 to 3 percent of the population, whose ancestors
 converted from Orthodox Christianity to I slam. Most are Muslim, although a num-
 bet have become atheists or converted to Christianity.) These are the country's two
 largest minorities. There are no restrictions on the speaking of Turkish in public
 or the use of non-Slavic names.
 Voluntary Turkish-language classes in public schools, funded by the Government,
 continued in areas with significant Turkish-speaking populations, although some ob-
 servers complained that the Government was .discouraging the optional angnage
 classes in areas with large concentrations of Bulgarian Muslims. According to MOE
 figures, there are 844 Turkish language teachers for 64,000 children who study
 
 
 1021
 Turkish as their mother tongue. Some ethnic Turkish leaders, mainly in the MRF,
 demanded that Turkish-language schooling be made compulsory in ethnic Turkish
 areas, but the Government has resisted this.
 In the 1992 census approximately 3.4 percent of the population identified itself
 as Romani. The real figure is probably about twice that high, since many persons
 of Romani descent tend to identify themselves to the authorities as ethnic Turks or
 Bulgarians. Romani groups continued to be divided among themselves, although
 several groups had some success presenting Romani issues to the Government. As
 individuals and as an ethnic group, Roma faced high levels of discrimination.
 Attacks by private citizens on Romani communities continued. On July 20 in
 Sliven, four youths ranging in age from 12 to 16 beat a Roma woman, continuing
 to kick her after she had fallen to the ground. The woman died of her injuries the
 next day. When asked why they committed such a crime, one boy replied that he
 wanted to kill her because she was a Gypsy. In December the district court at
 Sliven sentenced Miroslav Karapetkov, age 16, to 11/2 years in prison and Hranimir
 Petkov, age 16, to 6 months' imprisonment on probation. Two of the other attackers,
 both age 13, could not be tried, since they were juvenile offenders.
 On April 6, according to Human Rights Project, 5 Roma were beaten in front of
 the town hall in Sredno Selo by a crowd of approximately 100 persons after they
 were accused of stealing cattle from a nearby village.
 On June 1, three apparently drunken soldiers violently harassed Roma in the vil-
 lage of Sarantsi. According to witnesses, they entered the Roma neighborhood and
 beat several passers-by while shooting at others. One man was shot in the stomach
 at close range. The police arrested the soldier who fired the weapon, and an inves-
 tigation is under way.
 The investigation into the death of Anguel Ivanov, who was killed by seven teen-
 agers in Shumen in 1996 remains incomplete. One of the victims of an attack by
 skinheads on three Roma in Samokov in 1996 filed charges, which were refused by
 the District Prosecutor's Office in February. After an appeal by an attorney from
 Human Rights Project, the case was reopened for additional investigation.
 Police harass, physically abuse, and arbitrarily arrest Romani street children (see
 Sections 1.c. and 1.d.). Roma encounter difficulties applying for social benefits, and
 rural Roma are discouraged from claiming land to which they are entitled under the
 law disbanding agricultural collectives. Many Roma and other observers made credi-
 ble allegations that the quality of education offered to Romani children is inferior
 to that afforded most other students. The Government has been largely unsuccessful
 in attracting and keeping many Romani children in school.
 Workplace discrimination against minorities continued to be a problem, especially
 for Roma. Employers justify such discrimination on the basis that most Roma have
 relatively low training and education. Supervisory jobs are generally given to ethnic
 Bulgarian employees, with ethnic Turks, Bulgarian Muslims, and Roma among the
 fi-sttobelaid off.
 During compulsory military service most Roma (and Muslims-see Section 2.c.)
 are shunted into units where they often perform commercial, military construction,
 or maintenance work rather than serve in normal military units. The MRF pro-
 tested this practice, as did human rights groups and labor observers who cited it
 as a violation of International Labor Organization (ILO) accords. There are only a
 few ethnic Turkish and Romani officers in the military, and reportedly only one
 high-ranking Muslim officer.
 Thousands of Bulgarians, mainly in the southwest, identify themselves as Mac-
 edonians, most for historical and geographic reasons. Members of the two organiza-
 tions that purport to defend their interests, Omo-Ilinden and Tmo-Ilinden, are be-
 lieved to number in the hundreds (see Section 2.b.).
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The 1991 Constitution provides for the right of all
 workers to form or join trade unions of their own choice, and this right was appar-
 ently freely exercised. Estimates of the unionized share of the work force range from
 30 to 50 percent. This share continues to shrink as large firms lay off workers, and
 most new positions appear in small, nonunionized businesses.
 There are two large trade union confederations, the Confederation of Independent
 Trade Unions of Bulgaria (CITUB), and Podkrepa. CITUB, the successor to the
 trade union controlled by the former Communist regime, operates as an independent
 entity. Podkrepa, an independent confederation created in 1989, was one of the ear-
 liest opposition forces but is no longer a member of the Union of Democratic Forces,
 formerly the main opposition party and now in Government. In 1995 a third trade
 union confederation, the Community of Free Union Organizations in Bulgaria
 (CFOUB), was admitted to the National Tripartite Coordination Council (NTCC),
 
 
 1022
 which includes employers and the Government (see Section 6.b.). In 1996 a new self-
 described labor union/civic organization called "Promyana" (Bulgarian for "change ")
 was founded with the explicit goal of removing the Bulgarian Socialist Party from
 power via early elections. Although never officially registered as a labor union,
 Promyana attracted members of various professions and trades to its ranks and par-
 ticipated visibly in the January and early February demonstrations.
 The 1992 Labor Code recognizes the right to strike when other means of conflict
 resolution have been exhausted, but "political strikes" are forbidden. This prohibi-
 tion was widely ignored in January and early February when workers across the
 country from a variety of industries joined with students and then-opposition politi-
 cal parties in massive general strikes that brought much of the country's economic
 activity to a halt. The strikes ended when agreement was reached on February 4
 to holdearly parliamentary elections in April.
 Workers In essential services are prohibited from striking, but a common practice
 of such workers is to hold an "effective strike" in which they stop or slow their ac-
 tivities for an hour or two. This practice was employed repeatedly in the politically
 motivated popular unrest in January and early February.
 No evidence emerged that the Government interfered with the right to strike, and
 several work stoppages took place. The Labor Code's prohibitions agalnst antiunion
 discrimination include a 6-month period of protection against dismissal as a form
 of retribution. While these provisions appear to be within international norms, there
 is no mechanism other than the courts for resolving complaints, and the burden of
 proof in such a case rests entirely on the employee.
 No restrictions exist on affiliation or contact with international labor organiza-
 tions, and unions actively exercise this right.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Coilectively.-The Labor Code institutes
 collective bargaining, which is practiced nationally and on a local level. The legal
 prohibition against striking for key public sector employees weakens their bargain-
 ing position; however, these groups were able to influence negotiations by stagn
 protests and engagI in other pressure activities without going on strike. ot
 CITUE and Pokrpa cornplined that while the legal structure  or collective bar-
 gaining was adequate, many employers failed to bargain in good faith or adhere to
 agreements reached. Labor observers viewed the Governments enforcement of labor
 contracts as inadequate.
 There were several instances in which an employer was found guilty of antiunion
 discrimination, but the employers appealed the decisions. The backlog of cases in
 the legal system delayed further action, effectively postponing, perhaps indefinitely,
 the redress of workers' grievances.
 The same obligation of collective bargaining and adherence to labor standards
 prevails in the export processing zones, and unions may organize workers in these
 areas.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Constitution prohibits forced
 or compulsory labor, including that perfored by children. Many observers a ed
 that the practice of shunting minority and conscientious-objector military draftees
 into work units that often carry out commercial construction and maintenance
 projects is a form of compulsory labor (see Section 5). The Bulgarian Helsinki Com-
 mittee (BHC) reported in December that the Slavovitsa Labor Educational School
 employs forced child labor to produce articles sold in domestic and international
 markets. According to the report, minors are used as prison laborers for agricultural
 and industrial tasns as well. The BHC claims that forced labor by underage detain-
 ees-occurs in many "Labor Educational Schools," but cites Slavovitsa as the most
 eregious offender.
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment.-The
 Labor Code sets the minimum age for employment at 16 years; the minimum age
 for dangerous work is set at 18 years. Since children are not legally permitted to
 work, and the Constitution forbids forced or compulsory labor or all, forced and
 bonded labor by children is also forbidden bylaw.However, reports of such practices
 emerged during the year (see Section 6.c.). Employers and the mMiistry of Labor and
 Social Welfare (MLSW) are responsible for enforcing these provisions. Child labor
 laws are enforced well in the formal sector, but at least one child protection group
 believes that children are increasingly exploited in certain industries (especially
 small family-owned shops, construction, and periodical sales) and by organized
 crime (notably for prostitution and distribution of narcotics). No reliable data are
 currently available or the informal sector. According to the ILO, to date no violators
 of child labor laws have been fined or imprisoned. Underage employment in the in-
 formal and agricultural sectors is increasing as collective farms are broken up and
 the private sector continues to grow. In addition, children are known to work on
 family-owned tobacco farms.

 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The national monthly minimum wage at the
 close of the year was approximately $25 (45,500 Leva). The minimum wage is not-
 enough to provide a wage earner and family with a decent standard of living. Non-
 payment of wages and wage payments in arrears increased as many firms reg-
 istered increasing losses in the opening weeks of 1997 during the worst days of the
 economic crisis. Twelve state-owned plants reportedly paid no wages at all in the
 second quarter. The extremely high inflation (and accompanying devaluation of the
 Lev) prevailing at that time further eroded the value of delaed salary payments.
 The Constitution stipulates the right to social security and welfare aid assistance
 for the temporarily unemployed, although in practice such assistance is often either
 late or not paid.
 The Labor Code provides for a standard workweek of 40 hours with at least one
 24-hour rest period per week. The MLSW is responsible for enforcing both the mini-
 mum wage and the standard workweek. Enforcement has been generally effective
 in the state sector but is weaker in the emerging private sector.
 A national labor safety program exists, with standards established by the Labor
 Code. The Constitution stipulates that employees are entitled to healthy and non-
 hazardous working conditions. The MLSW is responsible for enforcing these provi-
 sions. Under the Labor Code, employees have the right to remove themselves from
 work situations that present a serious or immediate danger to life or health without
 jeopardizing their continued employment. In practice a refusal to work in situations
 with relatively high accident rates or associated chronic health problems would re-
 sult in the loss of employment for many workers. Conditions in many cases are
 worsening due to budget stringencies and a growing private sector that labor inspec-
 tors do not yet supervise effectively. Protective clothing is often absent from hazard-
 ous areas (goggles for welders, helmets for construction workers, etc.) since employ-
 ers often imp y that payment for such measures would have to be deducted from
 the overall budget used to pay workers' wages. Although the prestige of organized
 labor rose with the ultimate success of the popular general strikes early in the year,
 the overall well-being of workers deteriorated in 1997. The pervasive economic crisis
 and imminent, long-overdue privatizations have created a heightened fear of unem-
 ployment, leading to a reluctance on the part of workers to pursue wage and safety
 demands.
 On September 1, the country suffered its worst mining disaster when seven min-
 ers were killed and many more were injured in an accident at the Bobov Dol pits
 (three more miners later died of their injuries). An investigation revealed that neg-
 ligence due to a lack of proper safety precautions was responsible for the disaster.
