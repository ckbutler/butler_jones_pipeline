 VIETNAM
 The Socialist Republic of Vietnam (SRV) is a totalitarian state
 ruled by the Vietnamese Communist Party, the sole source of
 political power. Although there were significant leadership
 changes in 1986, the ruling group remains essentially those who
 fought the long war of independence from France, took power in
 the north after the country was partitioned in 1954, launched
 the armed effort to gain control of South Vietnam in the early
 1960's, and unified Vietnam after the fall of Saigon in 1975.
 A strong sense of nationalism has characterized Vietnam's
 history and culture for more than 1,000 years. Resistance
 against Chinese empires encroaching from the north and
 expansion at the expense of declining civilizations (the Cham
 and Khmer) to the south and west have had a major effect on
 Vietnamese political culture, reinforcing a perception of
 Vietnam as the natural leader of Indochina and fostering a
 narrow sense of identity in the generally northern-based
 Vietnamese leadership group.
 This cultural and historical background has important
 implications for human rights in Vietnam. Regional, religious,
 ethnic, and other groups outside of the northern, Communist
 core are viewed with suspicion. The loyalty of southerners has
 been questioned because of their separate political and
 cultural history. Many religious leaders, despite legally
 guaranteed freedom of religion, have been imprisoned on what
 free societies would classify as political charges. Cham
 Muslims in the south and minority groups of the central
 highlands are particular targets of government repression.
 The public security apparatus is pervasive, but in the recent
 past it has.relaxed intrusive controls, especially over the
 average citizen who does not have ties to the previous regime
 in the south or express opposition to the current leadership.
 The Government has imprisoned those suspected of political
 crimes in reeducation camps without trial or charge.
 Fundamental rights and liberties, including freedom of
 association and the right to privacy, are severely restricted.
 Vietnam also has transgressed human rights in Cambodia, which
 it has occupied for a decade.
 In December 1986, the Vietnamese Communist Party held what was
 then seen as a watershed Sixth Congress. The Congress resulted
 in the apparent retirement of the old guard, the ascendance of
 Nguyen Van Linh as party leader, and promises of greater
 political openness and economic restructuring. Since then only
 limited progress has been made in both the political and
 economic realms, in part because of differing views among the
 leadership on how to proceed, resistance to change in the
 obdurate bureaucracy, and the obstacles posed by the extreme
 poverty of the country. This near stagnation also
 characterized the human rights situation. Positive
 developments included: 1) literature and elements of the press
 were more lively and honestly critical of the regime's
 shortcomings; 2) the Government continued to grant amnesty to
 reeducation camp inmates; 3) travel restrictions were eased;
 and 4) the apparent failure of the controversy over the
 Vatican's canonization of Vietnamese martyrs to reverse the
 regime's relaxation of restrictions on Vietnamese Catholicism.
 Offsetting these developments, however, was the trial and
 conviction of a group of writers in the spring of 1988 and
 subsequent trials of alleged counterrevolutionaries,
 particularly two Buddhist monks who were sentenced to death.

 RESPECT FOR H[T]AN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 Information on current conditions in reeducation camps is
 scarce, but reeducation camp detainees released in 1987 have
 reported that guards sometimes shot to death those attempting
 to escape. There were reports that in the absence of
 high-ranking officials, guards kicked to death inmates who
 appeared to resist orders. Conditions in the camps are severe;
 a significant number of deaths result from malnutrition,.
 exhaustion, and other unnatural causes.
 b. Disappearance
 There is no recent evidence of political abductions by
 government security organizations and no reports of
 disappearances or hostage-taking by forces resisting government
 authorities.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 There are credible and consistent reports from refugees
 concerning the severity of conditions in reeducation camps and
 prisons. The authorities have attempted to produce conformity
 through confinement, hard labor, self-criticism, and
 indoctrination. Detainees face substandard nutrition, poor or
 nonexistent medical care and severe and often arbitrary
 punishment for minor infractions of camp rules.. An inmate
 released in 1987 stated that he was shackled in solitary
 confinement in a room without light for several months. Former
 detainees have also reported that inmates were sometimes tied
 to posts over anthills and then beaten.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The Vietnamese legal system is characterized by arbitrary
 detention, without charge or other form of legal process, under
 Jthe guise of reeducation. For major crimes, including alleged
 political offenses, public security officials must obtain
 warrants before apprehending and searching suspects. The
 officials are not required, however, to show these warrants to
 those they apprehend. Officials then can hold suspects for an
 indefinite period. Refugees have reported that authorities
 sometimes wait several months before notifying relatives of
 those arrested. According to refugees, since 1979 the normal
 practice has been to conduct kangaroo trials of those
 apprehended on political charges, detain them in jail for
 several months, and then move them to reeducation camps. One
 former inmate reported that there are two kinds of camps:
 indoctrination and penal. Inmates whom the authorities
 consider particularly recalcitrant are sent to the latter.
 Accurate figures for the number of people in prisons and
 reeducation camps are not available. The Vietnamese media have
 not publicized numbers for the prison population and have
 released conflicting reports on the total number of inmates in
 reeducation camps. In June 1988, Interior Minister Mai Chi
 Tho told newsmen that 500,000 people, including more than
 100-,000 "officers" had been sent to reeducation camps after
 the fall of Saigon in 1975. A high-ranking SRV official told
 
 
 958
 VIETNAM
 a visiting U.S. delegation that 1,000 remained in the camps as
 of early 1988. In January 1988, Party Leader Nguyen Van Linh
 announced that all inmates would be released by the end of the
 year and would be allowed to emigrate.
 The Government has announced a number of amnesties over the
 last 13 years. The Vietnamese media reported that in
 September 1987 the Government released 480 who had been
 officials in the south before 1975. The following month,
 1,014 more were released, and in September 1988 an additional
 30 were freed from the camps. After the February amnesty, the
 Vietnamese announced that 159 former South Vietnamese
 officials or "collaborators" remained in the camps, but in May
 1988 a Deputy Foreign Minister told newsmen that the figure
 was from 200 to 300. The following month a government
 information officer told journalists that no more than 190 or
 so former southern officials were still in the camps, but
 neither aspect of Linh's January promise has been fulfilled.
 For routine crimes, a suspect may be apprehended on a warrant
 which stipulates the nature of the crime and which authorizes
 detention for 2 months prior to trial. A 2-month extension of
 the detention period may be obtained on application. There is
 no provision for bail or legal counsel prior to trial.
 Camp populations are composed of ordinary criminals,
 prostitutes, drug addicts, those charged with political
 offenses, persons apprehended attempting to flee the country,
 intellectuals, former military chaplains, and clergy from both
 Buddhist and Christian faiths, as well as former officials and
 military officers associated with South Vietnam. The
 Government uses the camps to remove from society those persons
 whom it sees as dissidents, particularly leaders of potential
 opposition groups.
 According to one report, although basic sentences for many
 former South Vietnamese officials have ranged from 2 through 7
 years, sentencing appears to be arbitrary. The report
 asserted that the length of sentence was correlated directly
 to rank and position held (former intelligence and
 psychological warfare officers were given longer than normal
 sentences) and correlated inversely to the bribe paid by the
 detainee's family. In a small move toward leniency, Ho Chi
 Minh City (formerly Saigon) authorities in July 1987 announced
 that reeducation could be deferred for those who were
 pregnant, ill, related to war invalids or war dead, or faced
 with serious family difficulties. No information is available
 on the extent to which this guideline has been implemented.
 With regard to forced or compulsory labor, see Section 6.c.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Persons charged with offenses rarely receive a fair public
 trial. The defense counsel is supposed to ensure that proper
 legal procedures are followed, in accordance with the
 defendant's rights under the Constitution, and to explain the
 proceedings to the defendant. However, the defense counsel is
 not an advocate for the defendant as in other countries that
 have both common and civil law systems. In general, the legal
 system operates as an agency for the enforcement of regime
 directives; it is not independent from political intervention.
 According to refugees, a new penal code announced in mid-1985
 has not engendered any true reform in the legal system.
 
 
 959
 VIETNAM
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Government operates a nationwide system of population
 surveillance and control through a household registration
 system and party-appointed block wardens who use informants to
 keep track of each person's activities. This system exists in
 both urban and rural areas. It works imperfectly in southern
 Vietnam, however, partly because of a shortage of trusted
 party workers. In the recent past, the security apparatus has
 reduced its overt control over the population, particularly
 the average citizen who has no ties to the previous southern
 regime and who expresses no opposition to the current
 Government. In addition, according to refugees, the
 population is increasingly able to circumvent security
 restrictions through bribery of party and government officials.
 There have been reports of official and nonofficial security
 wardens conducting searches of homes for draft-age males in
 order to fulfill draft quotas. There continue to be reliable
 reports that Ministry of the Interior officials inspect and
 sometimes confiscate mail and packages sent to Vietnam,
 particularly those sent to politically suspect persons.
 Outgoing mail is subject to inspection and censorship.
 Security officials have also followed foreign visitors. The
 Western press reported one incident in early 1988, when police
 forced a Vietnamese to confess that she had allowed a foreigner
 into her home.
 The State encourages and reportedly sometimes compels family
 planning in an effort to reduce the growth rate of Vietnam's
 burgeoning population. Refugees have reported that the
 official limit is two children to a family, but this is often
 ignored, especially in the south. Recently, inducements and
 penalties have been reaffirmed, but there is no official
 corroboration of refugee reports that some women have been
 forced to have abortions in an effort to uphold the two-child
 limitation.
 The regime has widely publicized its program to relocate
 millions of people to "new economic zones" in virgin or
 unproductive rural areas in order to reduce unemployment in
 urban centers and expand agricultural production. The
 Vietnamese media characterize this resettlement as voluntary,
 but in many cases it has involved coercion as local officials
 have striven to meet quotas. The resettlement program
 initially targeted those whose views and backgrounds were seen
 as politically suspect and who were often therefore unable to
 find employment. Conditions in these zones are reportedly
 extremely poor. Almost no basic services are provided,
 although the Government does pledge to supply housing, tools,
 seeds, and fertilizer. Many resettled persons found it
 impossible to maintain life in these zones and returned to the
 cities where they were forced to live without the ration cards
 and neighborhood registration cards essential to procuring
 regular employment, food, and essential services. A ranking
 Vietnamese official recently stated that at least 500,000 such
 unregistered people reside in Ho Chi Minh City. In 1987 the
 Government acknowledged that living and working conditions in
 the zones were not satisfactory. As a result, according to a
 Western press report, Hanoi modified the program and reduced
 the number scheduled to be moved in the 1985-1990 Five-Year
 Plan from 3 to 1.5 million. Even so, the targets have been
 difficult to meet. Vietnamese media reported that in the
 first quarter of 1988 the Government was able to move only
 
 
 960
 VIETNAM
 about one half (42,700 people) the number called for in the
 state plan, and in December 1988 Hanoi radio said facilities
 at the sites are still "highly inadequate."
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Freedom of speech is severely limited in Vietnam. The
 Ministry of Culture and Information and Communist Party organs
 control all newspapers, books, and other publications, as well
 as all cultural exhibitions. Criticism of the party and the
 Government is allowed only within limits set by authorities.
 In the period leading up to the December 1986 Party Congress,
 the media published a number of critical articles, presumably
 aimed at easing senior leaders out of power. In line with his
 more open style, the new Party General Secretary, Nguyen Van
 Linh, initiated a series of articles in May 1987 outlining
 what needed to be done to put the country on the right track.
 Responding to this more critical approach, the media published
 a number of reports revealing corruption and inefficiency.
 In 1988 the Politburo released a resolution on culture and art
 encouraging this trend. The Government also announced a draft
 press law to give journalists clearer guidelines on the limits
 of negative reporting. The resolution of the June 1988 Fifth
 Party Plenum, however, was ambivalent about the parameters of
 acceptable criticism. The resolution praised the press for
 revealing officials' shortcomings, but criticized the cultural
 and art sectors for overemphasizing the negative while
 underemphasizing the positive. The resolution also criticized
 the "lax control" over video showings. According to Western
 press reports, video cinemas had screened domestic and foreign
 films critical of Vietnamese society. Nevertheless, the
 overall trend in 1988 was toward greater openness in the
 artistic realm. Two books, for example, addressed topics that
 previously were taboo, the war in Cambodia and Communist
 atrocities in the 1968 Tet offensive. Another sign of a thaw
 was the plan, reported by Western media, of the Writers
 Association to reinstate the membership of five authors
 expelled from the group 30 years earlier after they had called
 for greater literary freedom.
 The SRV remained sensitive to foreign influence in the
 cultural sphere. Asia Watch, a Western human rights group,
 reported that four writers and a postal worker were convicted
 in April 1988 of trying to communicate with foreigners. In
 May 1988, the Vietnamese media also criticized the performance
 of a visiting Hong Kong cultural troupe for undermining the
 cultural values of young people.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 There are prohibitions against meeting either publicly or
 privately to criticize or protest government actions or
 policies. According to refugees, citizens must obtain
 permission to hold gatherings of over three people.
 Nongovernmental organizations, such as church groups, can meet
 only for approved and narrowly defined objectives, such as
 religious services. According to Vietnamese Radio in
 September, a court in Ho Chi Minh City sentenced Buddhist
 monks (who had been held since 1984) to death for creating a
 "counterrevolutionary organization called the Vietnam Human
 Rights Front and later the Forces of Free Vietnam." In
 September one lay person was also sentenced to death for
 
 
 961
 VIETNAM
 counterrevolutionary activities. In October, presumably in
 response to adverse foreign reaction, these cases were
 submitted to the Court of Appeal for reconsideration, and the
 death sentences of the two monks were commuted to 20-years'
 imprisonment.
 Mass organizations, such as women's federations, have been
 organized to maintain control over various sectors of the
 population. They disseminate propaganda and policy
 guidelines, support party-sanctioned activities, but also
 recently have been encouraged to take more active watchdog
 roles.
 For a discussion of freedom of association as it applies to
 labor unions, see Section 6.a.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 The Government tolerates the existence of most religious
 groups and allows some religious services but is concerned
 that religious groups could become seedbeds of subversion and
 political opposition. It has consistently attempted to divide
 and control the Catholic, Buddhist, Hoa Hao, Cao Dai, Muslim,
 and other religious groups, in part by establishing
 government-controlled policymaking bodies such as the Catholic
 Patriotic Association. In the past the Government has
 attempted to prevent the growth of religious groups by
 blocking publication of religious materials and prohibiting
 the training of new clergy.
 In 1987 the Government slightly eased its policy on religion
 even as it continued to take strong measures against religious
 persons it-considered a threat to the regime. According to
 foreign observers, Catholics and Protestants were able to
 attend church services without government interference. The
 Government permitted two Catholic leaders to attend a
 worldwide synod, and it sanctioned the opening of two
 seminaries. (The Government continued to control the teachers
 at the seminaries, however, and determined which students
 would be admitted, generally ruling out those with ties to the
 former southern regime.) In 1987 the number of priests
 ordained, according to the Western press, increased from a
 handful in 1986 to 150. The Government also allowed printing
 of the New Testament but apparently continued to bar
 importation or publication of the Bible.
 In 1988 the controversy over the Vatican's canonization of 117
 martyrs who had served the church in Vietnam seriously
 threatened the gains that had been made the previous year in
 easing church-state relations. These martyrs, 21 of whom were
 Europeans, had worked in Vietnam in the 11th and 18th
 centuries, and Hanoi accused the Vatican of honoring colonial
 collaborators. The Vietnamese complained that Rome had not
 consulted with it before announcing the canonization and had
 chosen the date of the former southern regime's armed forces
 day (June 19) for the ceremony. The media also criticized
 Vietnamese Cardinal Trinh Van Can for signing the canonization
 application during a trip abroad without prior discussion with
 the "Vietnamese Church" or the State. The Government held
 study sessions for Vietnamese Catholics to insure that they
 knew the official line. Hanoi barred Vietnamese bishops from
 attending the canonization ceremony, but the bishops
 nevertheless expressed their support for it in a telegram to
 the Pope. Subsequently, Hanoi may have moderated its stance
 on the canonization. The Catholic Patriotic Association
 
 
 962
 VIETNAM
 reportedly wrote a positive article on the ceremony, and the
 Government allowed open display of pictures of the martyrs.
 Another area of church-state friction was the March 1988
 petition of Hue Archbishop Nguyen Kim Dien for restoration of
 his civil rights. The Government forbade him from performing
 his pastoral duties in 1984 after he had opposed participation
 of a priest in his diocese in the Catholic Patriotic
 Association. The Archbishop died on June 8, 1988.
 According to Western and Vietnamese sources, the number of
 Catholic faithful is increasing. The Vietnamese media
 reported in January 1988 that Catholics number 4 million. The
 Vatican put the figure at 6 million. Hanoi and Rome both put
 the number of priests at 12,000 and bishops at 40. According
 to one report, six seminaries were open as of mid-1988, but
 they faced a shortage of teachers. Despite these positive
 developments, a military chaplain freed from a reeducation
 camp in 1987 reported that 125 chaplains remained in the camps
 at the time of his release.
 Most of Vietnam's 30,000 Muslims are members of the Cham
 minority, which the regime distrusts. The linkage of Cham,
 Khmer Krom, and hilltribe (Montagnard) groups provides the
 only sizable resistance movement in Vietnam: the United
 Liberation Front of Oppressed Races (FULRO). In its
 repression of the Cham, the Government has eliminated the
 position of mufti (religious leader) within the Muslim
 communities, disbanded organized Muslim associations, and
 severed links with overseas Muslims. The regime forbids the
 religious pilgrimage to Mecca and has not given permission for
 the Muslim community to participate in the Koran reading
 contest held annually in Malaysia. Many Muslim schools have
 been closed, but most mosques remain open. Importation and
 publication of the Koran is forbidden.
 About half of Vietnam's population is Buddhist, but Vietnamese
 media have reported that only 6 million are active adherents.
 The majority belong to the Mahayana sect. Vietnamese
 authorities have tried repeatedly since 1975 to suppress and
 intimidate the Mahayana leadership. Officials have seized
 temples and transformed them into public buildings. They have
 arrested monks intermittently since 1975. According to a
 Western human rights watch group, a large number of monks
 remain in reeducation camps. The Vietnamese press agency
 reported that in January 1988 monks numbered more than 10,000
 and that there were 2 university-level institutes of Buddhism.
 The regime's attempts to control and suppress the Buddhists
 became more systematized as a result of a conference, which it
 organized in November 1981 and which established the Unified
 Vietnam Buddhist Church. The group's charter states that it
 is "the only Buddhist organization representing Vietnamese
 Buddhism in all other relations in the country and with other
 countries." Strong controls are outlined in the charter: all
 Buddhist temples are placed under the control of local people's
 revolutionary committees; prayer sessions and meditations, as
 well as meetings between monks of different temples, are
 allowed only with the permission of the local committees.
 Most of the Theravada Buddhists are ethnic Khmer (Khmer
 Krom). Numbering about 800,000, they live in southern and
 southwestern Vietnam, and have provided the Vietnamese forces
 occupying Cambodia with interpreters and staff. Nevertheless,
 
 
 963
 VIETNAM
 the Vietnamese distrust the Khmer Krom, partly for historical
 reasons   A number of Theravada leaders have been imprisoned.
 The regime has also persecuted other religious groups. The
 Hoa Hao (an anti-Communist Buddhist armed sect) strongly
 resisted the Communist takeover of the south in 1975. As a
 result, the Government violently repressed the sect and
 arrested virtually all of its leaders. The regime still
 maintains tight control over Hoa Hao areas. Refugees have
 reported that Hoa Hao adherents continue to resist the
 authorities and demand their human rights even in reeducation
 camps. The regime has also arrested many of the leaders of
 the Cao Da, a uniquely Vietnamese armed sect that embraces
 elements of Buddhism and Christianity. In previous years
 refugees reported police occupation of the Cao Dai Holy See in
 Tay Ninh City. The official press kras claimed that Cao Dai
 leaders used the Holy See to establish an antigovernment
 subversive organization, for broadcasting and printing
 antigovernment messages, and for storing arms for an
 uprising. Some leaders have been tried and executed for these
 activities, according to the official media. The trial of 2
 Cao Dai leaders and 31 alleged accomplices was publicized in
 August 19a3.
 Adherence to a religion is incompatible with membership in the
 Communist Party, which espouses atheism. Party membership is,
 in turn, a major stepping-stone toward political, economic, and
 educational advancement in Vietnam.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Approval is required for all foreign travel. In early 1988,
 however, the Government announced that it would authorize
 private travel abroad for education, tourism, medical
 treatment, and visits to close relatives. The travel would be
 restricted to 3 months, except in the case of travel for
 education or medical treatment, and violators would be barred
 from further travel for 3 to 5 years. Until this
 announcement, permission for temporary travel abroad was
 normally granted only to government officials or approved
 spokesmen for quasi-government organizations. In June 1988,
 the Government issued a circular on granting exit visas for
 family reunification. It applied to husbands and wives,
 children, parents, and brothers and sisters.
 Identity cards are required for internal travel. They
 generally are not issued to those released from reeducation
 camps, but one former detainee reported that he was able to
 purchase one for the equivalent of $500 in 1987. No one is
 allowed to change his residence or work location without
 permission from the authorities. Since public security cadres
 frequently check each household's occupants against the
 official family register, unauthorized absences can subject
 families to punishment.
 In previous years the Vietnamese had reduced the number of
 departures of Vietnamese refugees to the United States and
 other receiving countries. After extended negotiations, the
 Vietnamese allowed renewed interviews of qualified refugees
 and immigrants by U.S. Government officers in September 1987.
 This resulted in 1988 in a program whereby a number of
 Amerasians and of those seeking family reunification emigrated
 to the United States. In bilateral talks in July 1988, the
 United States and Vietnam reached agreement in principle on
 
 
 964
 VIETNAM
 the resettlement to the United States of former reeducation
 center detainees. Subsequently, the Vietnamese unilaterally
 suspended talks on the implementation of this program.
 Refugees left Vietnam clandestinely during 1987 at a high
 rate. In part, this was because of a safer route opened
 across Cambodia. This trip involved land and sea travel from
 Ho Chi Minh City to eastern Thailand. Those who fled paid
 facilitators on the average $2,000 to $3,000 per person,
 usually after they reached their destination safely. This
 route virtually shut down in early 1988 after Thailand
 instituted deterrent measures. Some who fled were forced to
 go back to Vietnam. According to several reports, these
 repatriates faced no punishment or discrimination after their
 return. In midyear, as part of Hanoi's effort to improve its
 image abroad, the Vietnamese agreed to increase acceptance of
 voluntary repatriates, provided there was financial
 assistance. An accord was signed with Hong Kong, and the
 Vietnamese also offered to encourage volunteers from camps in
 Malaysia to return.
 In mid-1987 Vietnam relaxed its restrictions on tourist
 permits for those who had fled the country, prompted in part
 by the need to earn foreign exchange. Now, only those who
 committed "serious crimes" are not allowed to visit.
 Since the occupation of Cambodia by Vietnam, large numbers of
 Vietnamese have settled in Cambodia. Although some of these
 persons are former residents expelled by the Lon Nol Government
 and later by the Khmer Rouge, others are first-time settlers.
 In June 1988, Vietnam adopted a new nationality law. It
 stated that those who wished to divest themselves of
 Vietnamese citizenship could renounce it formally but that the
 Government would need to approve the request.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Citizens are not free to change their Communist-dominated
 system of government. All authority and political power is
 vested in the Vietnamese Communist Party. Political
 opposition to this system is not tolerated. The Politburo of
 the Central Committee of the Vietnam Communist Party is the
 supreme decisionmaking body in the nation. The Politburo's
 powerful Secretariat oversees day-to-day implementation of
 directives. The party leadership selects candidates for the
 Central Committee, while periodic national party congresses
 merely ratify the previously selected candidates. Each
 congress is made up of delegates from the party apparatus of
 each province, who are similarly selected by those at higher
 levels.
 Ostensibly the chief legislative body, the National Assembly,
 has long followed the guidelines and policies of the party
 but, in the past year, has been accorded some role in policy
 development and oversight. Government policies and ministers
 were openly criticized at the June 1988 session which saw the
 first open election of the premier. The party choice, Do
 Muoi, won, but his southern opponent, Vo Van Kiet, got about a
 third of the votes cast. National Assembly elections are held
 in Vietnam every 5 years. However, the elections scheduled
 for 1986 were postponed until April 1987. These elections
 were slightly more democratic than previous ones. In the
 past, the party selected most candidates, but this time
 
 
 965
 VIETNAM
 candidates were nominated in public meetings. However, the
 quasi-governmental mass organization, the Vietnam Fatherland
 Front, evaluated all candidates. Voters had an opportunity to
 criticize candidates and had a greater selection than before,
 with 829 competing for 600 seats. From the single list
 presented to them, voters may only strike out the names of
 candidates for whom they do not wish to vote. In several
 cases during the most recent elections for the National
 Assembly, however, no candidate received sufficient votes. In
 those cases it was necessary to hold follow-up elections with
 new candidates.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government does not cooperate with international human
 rights groups and it strongly resents criticism of its human
 rights policies.
 Foreign delegations and journalists who have been allowed to
 visit reeducation camps have been shown only model camps.
 Former detainees have described extensive preparations to
 beautify camps prior to visits, temporary removal of most
 detainees during the visit, and careful briefing of the
 remaining detainees by Communist party cadres on what to tell
 delegation members. The Government does not permit the
 existence of private human rights groups in Vietnam.
 Vietnam is not a member of any international human rights
 organization, nor is it active in promoting human rights in
 other countries. In 1988, however, the Vietnamese permitted
 the Vietnamese Red Cross to participate in international
 meetings.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Gradual assimilation and cooption appear to be the
 Government's long-run strategy for most minorities. The
 Government has created special schools in the Hanoi area to
 train minority cadres to be the "eyes and ears" of the party
 among their own people. Highland minorities in central
 Vietnam are subject to repression if suspected of ties with
 resistance groups. Officially programmed resettlement of
 ethnic Vietnamese into the highlands is designed in part to
 increase government control over minority groups once
 dedicated to hunting, gathering, and slash-and-burn
 agriculture. As new inhabitants change ancient land use and
 ownership patterns, the tribes are being forced into settled.
 agriculture. Minorities in the south, such as the Chinese and
 the Indians, have been encouraged to leave the country. Since
 the adoption of economic reforms, however, the Government has
 valued the entrepreneurial skills of the Chinese population
 and has allowed a limited renaissance of private enterprise in
 Cholon, the area of Ho Chi Minh City where the Chinese
 population is concentrated.
 People released from reeducation camps face considerable
 discrimination, according to refugees. They do not regain
 their citizenship until 1 year after leaving the camps, if
 then. In addition, their children generally are not allowed
 to attend college.
 
 
 966
 VIETNAM
 According to a Western academic specialist on Vietnam, the
 regime divides students applying for admission into
 universities into categories depending on their family
 status. Refugees have confirmed this and added that the
 regime goes back three generations when assessing family
 background. The passing grade on entrance examinations is
 lower for those with close links to the current regime (such
 as children of party officials). The passing grade required
 of those at the other end of the spectrum, such as children of
 officials of the former southern government, is so high as to
 virtually foreclose the possibility of attending university.
 The party committee in each school reportedly has the final
 determination as to who will graduate. Similarly, study
 abroad is restricted to politically acceptable persons.
 Women do not appear to face discrimination in general
 employment. Women, however, do not have positions in the
 leadership of the country in proportion to their numbers.
 There are no women in the Vietnamese Politburo and only a
 handful in the party Central Committee.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 In lieu of independent labor groups, "unions" have been set up
 under the Vietnam General Federation of Labor Unions (VGFLU),
 which is controlled by the Communist Party. Claiming 3
 million members, the VGFLU's stated goal is to increase
 support for party policies and economic production. Strikes
 are "unpatriotic" and officially forbidden. The VGFLU's
 ineffectiveness and lack of interest in the welfare of the
 workers came under sharp attack last October by delegates to
 its first national congress in years. The VGFLU is affiliated
 with the World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU).
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 Workers are members of state-controlled trade unions and have
 no right to bargain collectively. Labor standards are applied
 uniformly throughout the country.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Forced labor has been used by Vietnamese, and by local
 authorities in Cambodia under Vietnamese control, for projects
 to improve the logistical infrastructure for Vietnamese
 occupation troops. Credible reports indicate that the
 Vietnamese have also used forced Cambodian labor to construct
 military fortifications and defensive barriers along the
 Thai-Cambodian border. A number of government projects in
 Vietnam have used forced labor provided by reeducation camp
 prisoners.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 No information is available on minimum age laws, but visitors
 have reported seeing children work in factories.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 Working conditions are generally poor. Wages for most workers
 are generally at or under basic subsistence levels. According
 to refugees, living conditions for workers have worsened since
 1987. Until that time the Government had guaranteed that

 workers could purchase a-fixed amount of rice at
 government-set prices. The Government dropped this provision
 and raised the monetary wage as compensation. The wage
 increase, however, was not enough to cover the price of rice
 in the free market, considerably higher than the
 government-set price.
 According to a Vietnamese press report, more than 120,000
 workers were sent abroad between 1980 and 1988. The Western
 media and refugees have reported that workers welcome the
 opportunity to go abroad to escape poor economic conditions at
 home, but some complaints about treatment abroad have recently
 been publicized in the Vietnamese media.
 As of early 1988, more than 40,000 Vietnamese were working
 under contract in the U.S.S.R. Vietnam announced that it
 would "assign" an additional 10,000 workers to the Soviet
 Union, the German Democratic Republic, Czechoslavakia,
 Bulgaria, Algeria, and Iraq throughout the year. A
 significant portion of the wages of overseas workers is
 deducted to help pay for Vietnam's debts to those countries.
 Criticism of Vietnam for this practice led it to withdraw from
 the International Labor Organization, effective May 31, 1985.
