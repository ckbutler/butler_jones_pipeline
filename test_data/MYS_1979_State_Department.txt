 MALAYSIA
 Malaysia has a multiracial and democratic society in which
 Malays dominate political affairs while ethnic Chinese and,
 to a lesser extent, Indians still play leading roles in
 the economy. The Government places among its highest
 priorities avoiding a repetition of severe violence such
 as followed the May 1969 elections when several hundred
 persons were reported to have died in communal riots in
 Kuala Lumpur. The Communist Party of Malaya (CPM) has been
 engaged in an "armed struggle" with the Government since
 1948. Three thousand CPM guerrillas are to a large degree
 contained in sanctuaries in Southern Thailand through
 joint Malaysian-Thai operations, although some armed
 insurgents operate in isolated units on Malaysian terri-
 tory. The latter's efforts against the Malaysian Government
 include ambush and attacks on military units as well as
 assassinations and acts of terrorism. The Government
 counter-insurgency effort continues to suffer scores of
 .Malaysian police and military personnel killed or maimed
 annually.
 The persistent insurgent threat and the ever-present
 possibility of renewed communal conflict are cited by the
 Malaysian Government as justification for legislation which
 makes legal the arrest and detention without trial of
 persons suspected of subversive activity or of other
 activities that threaten general civic order. Furthermore,
 renewed warfare in Indochina -- especially the Vietnamese
 invasion of Kampuchea and the consequent threat to Thailand
 Ca contiguous neighbor whose security Malaysia believes
 vital for its own) have strengthened alaysia's conviction
 of the need for stringent laws on broad security grounds.
 Despite the demands posed by the communist insurgency,
 Malaysia has made major progress in economic and social
 development in the twenty two years since gaining indepen-
 dence. It is one of the most prosperous developing countries
 in Asia with an average per capita gross national product
 (GNP) of $1185 in 1978, second in the region after Singapore.
 I.   Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 The Department of State has no evidence that torture is
 condoned as a normal practice by the Government, although
 individual instances of mistreatment by civil law enforcement
 personnel have occured. Such behavior is punishable, and
 several policemen have been sentenced to jail for causing
 the death of a suspect during interrogation. The report of
 an Amnesty International mission to Malaysia in 1978,
 released in August 1979, alleges that during the 60-day
 interrogation period provided for under the Internal Security
 Act (ISA) "ill-treatment and torture, both psychological and
 physical, often occur" in order to extract confessions.
 A report by the Malaysian Bar Council on the conditions of
 detention of persons held under the ISA also cites similar
 complaints.
 (488)
 
 
 489
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment is neither authorized
 nor condoned by the Government of Malaysia, but instances of
 mistreatment have occurred. Poor living conditions during
 incarceration have been reported by former detainees or
 relatives of detainees. Persons detained under the Internal
 Security Act are often held in solitary confinement. A June
 1979 report by the Malaysian Bar Council charges that
 detainees under the ISA, whose arrest is reportedly for
 preventive rather than punitive reasons, are treated as
 badly as criminals in terms of conditions of confinement,
 being handcuffed at times and being subjected to around-
 the-clock interrogation.
 c. Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 The Malaysian Constitution provides for the proclamation of
 a State of Emergency during which individual rights can be
 limited by law. A State of Emergency has existed since it
 was proclaimed in May 1969 during communal rioting. Legis-
 lation granting extraordinary powers to the Government
 enables arrest and imprisonment without benefit of trial or
 the right of habeas corpus.
 The Malaysian Government considers the CPM threat and
 continuing communal tensions to be adequate justification
 for the perpetuation and use of emergency powers which were
 first embodied in regulations by the British but later
 extended and made more comprehensive by Malaysian legislation.
 These regulations permit arrest and detention without open
 trial of persons suspected of subversive activity or other
 actions contributing to domestic instability. Known as the
 Internal Security Act (ISA) and the Emergency (Public Order
 and Prevention of Crime) Ordinance, 1969 (E.O.), they provide
 for initial preventive detention for up to two years.
 A person detained under the emergency laws has no recourse
 to the courts in the ordinary sense, but as soon as possible
 after arrest must be told the reason and given an opportunity
 to challenge the detention order. However, the Amnesty
 International mission and the Malaysian Bar Council both
 report being told of instances in which bills of particulars
 have been denied to detainees.
 Under the ISA, challenges to detention must be heard within
 three months by a three-man advisory board.. If the detention
 is upheld, the case is periodically reviewed by the Appeals
 Board and the detention order may then be renewed beyond
 the initial two-year period. Theoretically, the Executive
 must heed recommendations for release or else submit the
 case to the King for resolution. However, the report of
 the Amnesty international mission, which interviewed the
 Chairman of the Advisory Board, calls into question the
 efficacy of this appeals procedure. The report cites
 evidence that the Advisory Board's recommendations are
 often overruled by the Executive. According to constitutional
 provision, the Exegutive may refuse on national security
 grounds to disclose facts in a particular case, including
 reasons for overruling an Advisory Board recommendation.
 Without disputing the Chairman of the Advisory Board or
 the Amnesty International report on the facts of the cases
 cited, it should be pointed out that apparently few detention
 orders are renewed beyond the initial period. Most cases
 under the Internal Security Act often follow a cycle of
 arrest, detention, recantation and release.
 
 
 490
 The Emergency Ordinance, while enacted in the wake of the
 May 1969 racial disturbances, has been most often used
 against narcotics traffickers and other serious criminals
 in the absence of effective laws against conspiracy.
 The E.O., which has no provision for renewal, provides
 that after two years imprisonment a period of two years
 of "restricted residence" in .a remote area of the country
 may be ordered.
 In addition to the ISA and E.O., the Government also uses
 the Emergency (Essential Powers) Ordinance, 1969, designed
 to deal with terrorism and political violence, which
 provides the basis for regulations that substantially
 diminish the rights of the accused by allowing an in camera
 trial, anonymous witnesses and a presumption of guilt.
 A report issued in June 1979 by the Bar Council of Malaysia
 on "conditions of detentio4 of persons held under the
 Internal Security Act, 1960" also criticizes interference
 with the right of detainees to confidential communication
 with their attorneys.
 The Amnesty International report of 1979 stated that more
 than 1,000 persons are currently detained under ISA of whom
 more than 50 have been held for periods of longer than eight
 years, including one person for fifteen years.   (The Govern-
 ment's last announcement in November 1978 reported 89
 detainees held for more than five years.) The AI report
 contends that a majority of the detainees were at the time
 of their arrest members of legal political parties and trade
 unions who were not suspected of having engaged in violent
 political activity or terrorism. other observers believe
 that the majority are held on security and criminal, as
 contrasted to purely political grounds.
 d. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Modeled on the British judiciary, the Malaysian courts are
 generally regarded by the public and the legal community
 as committed to the rule of law and not susceptible to
 pressure from the Executive. Defendents have the right to
 counsel and lawyers are able to represent dissidents without
 penalty to themselves. Most civil and criminal cases are
 tried under this judicial system and thus public trial and
 a fair hearing occur in all but a small minority of cases.
 As noted above, however, persons detained for security
 reasons and certain classes of crimes are held and given
 hearings under special procedures outside the ordinary
 court system. Amnesty International states that, in fact,
 these hearing procedures are defective in practice.
 (See Section C)
 In non-security related cases, the courts scrupulously apply
 criminal law and procedures including rules of evidence
 which are at least as strict as in the U.S. Defendants are
 fully aware of charges against them prior to trial.
 e. Invasion of the Home
 Invasion of the houne is generally limited to cases involving
 security legislation. In its counter-insurgency effort
 against the CPM, the Government makes extensive use of its
 powers under the Internal Security Act to enter and search
 the homes of suspeccs.

 2.   Government Policies Relating to the Fulfillment of
 Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care and
 Education
 Malaysia has made significant economic advances in the
 two decades since independence and is now one of the most
 prosperous of the developing countries in East Asia (with
 a per capita GNP of $1185 in 1978). The multi-ethnic but
 Malay-dominated coalition Government has demonstrated its
 concern for raising the standard of living of all citizens
 and has made the alleviation of rural poverty -- mostly
 ethnic Malay - the primary goal of its domestic policy.
 The Third Malaysia Plan announced in mid-1975 logically
 follows earlier development efforts which concentrated
 on the broadening of essential services and industrial
 infrastructure. Among current programs are rural development
 initiatives, extensive government scholarships for children
 of the poor and programs to improve health care, education,
 housing and rural nutrition. Although the Government has
 sought to prevent Indochinese refugees from entering the
 country, Malaysia has in fact provided temporary asylum to
 as many as, 120,000 Vietnamese refugees as well as to over
 100,000 Philippine Muslim refugees. It has been doing so
 in spite of domestic fears of a residual refugee population
 which could upset the ethnic balance in the country.
 Corruption is less of a problem than in many other developing
 countries and the Government continues a vigorous drive
 against it.   It also continues to investigate and prosecute
 government officials for malfeasance and carries out campaigns
 to reform the bureaucracy.
 Malaysia has a free market economy with limited government
 intervention. There is a progressive income tax.
 Malaysian law respects the right to private property
 ownership.
 3.   Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 Tension between ethnic-Malay and ethnic-Chinese led to
 race riots in 1969 and the suspension of parliamentary
 democracy for two years. Since then, certain "sensitive"
 topics touching on ethnic origins or privileges may not be
 discussed specifically in public or in the Parliament.
 The State of Emergency legally proclaimed during the 1969
 communal rioting continues in effect. The emergency laws
 are designed to reduce the risk of communal violence by
 forbiding any public exacerbation of racial tensions.
 While radio and television are government controlled, the
 press is not. However, the press is constrained by the
 constitutional prohibitions against discussion of certain
 ethnically sensitive topics and, mindful of the need for
 annual renewal of publishing licenses, is circumspect in
 its treatment of government policies. Issues of foreign
 publications with articles focusing on the ethnic question
 have on rare occasion been removed from circulation.
 However, there ard no other restrictions on what may be
 printed, and the activities and statements of opposition
 political figures and domestic political developments are
 covered. Moreover, the press reports on violations of legal
 standards and acts as an informal ombudsman, as do the
 parliamentary opposition and the active Bar Association.
 
 
 492
 The Government practices affirmative action on an extensive
 scale in favor of the politically dominant but economically
 weaker ethnic Malays. Many non-Malays consider this policy
 discriminatory. As a result of these extensive affirmative
 action programs and policies, non-Malay opportunities for
 education, government employment, and participation in
 selected economic activities are carefully apportioned.
 This practice is based both on constitutional provisions
 and Government policies. On the other hand, most Malays, as
 a result of the social, cultural and economic system pre-
 vailing in the country until recently, were excluded from
 most areas of modern economic activity. The goal of Govern-
 ment-supported affirmative action programs is to modify the
 earlier pattern of ethnic economic discrimination while
 pursuing a successful economic development program and
 thereby eventually providing increased opportunities for all
 Malaysians.
 While the state religion of Malaysia is Islam, and Malaysian
 Muslims are legally bound by Muslim religious laws, the
 Federal Government itself does not discriminate against
 practioners of other religious faiths. Concern and controversy
 has been engendered by the attempts of Malaysian. Muslim.
 fundamentalists to extend the enforcement of Islamic laws
 against non-Muslim Malaysian and even other nationalities.
 However, the Government recently declared in Parliament in
 response to the fundamentalist challenge that it would not
 accede to demands for wider enforcement of Muslim law,
 pointing out that Malaysia is a multi-religious country.
 The Judiciary has also spoken out against replacing Common
 Law with Islamic Law.
 The Malaysian Constitution guarantees the right to freedom
 of peaceable assembly and association, although the Consti-
 tution also grants the government extensive powers to limit
 those rights in the interests of security and public order.
 In practice, the Societies Act and trade union legislation
 require that most organizations be registered with the
 government and thus subject to close control. In the wake
 of the communal disturbances of 1969 the government has
 passed laws greatly limiting the right to public assembly
 by large groups.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel and Emigration
 The Government generally permits free domestic and foreign
 travel, including emigration. Persons wishing to travel
 abroad must obtain passports which have been denied in a few
 cases on security grounds. The Government also restricts
 travel to China by ethnic Chinese citizens. Travel between
 Peninsular Malaysia and the Borneo states of Sabah and
 Sarawak is constitutionally subject to control by the State
 Governments as the result of conditions imposed by the Sabah
 and Sarawak Governments at the time of their accession to
 the Federation. The Sabah and Sarawak State Governments
 have on several occasions arbitrarily denied entry to
 opposition politiqians and journalists from Peninsular
 Malaysia.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Malaysia is a parliamentary democracy generally on the
 British model, with a Prime Minister and Cabinet responsible
 to Parliament. The Head of State is a constitutiohal monarch
 elected for a five-year ter. by the Sultans of those Malaysian
 
 
 493
 states which are Sultanates (nine df thirteen) from among
 their own members. The bi-cameral Parliament consists of a
 Senate (with both appointed and elected members) and an
 elected House of Representatives, where a small but vocal
 opposition criticizes the Government regularly. Legislative
 power is further divided between Federal and State legislatures.
 State Executive Administrations attend to matters of local
 concern. Elections on the basis of univeral suffrage are
 held at no longer than five-year intervals as specified by
 the constitution. The last National Parliamentary elections
 were held in July 1978. In Parliamentary and State Assembly
 elections the ruling National Front coalition takes full
 advantage of its incumbency, and in recent elections it
 has prohibited public rallies, a factor which inhibits the
 opposition. However, even the opposition concedes that
 votes are cast freely and secretly and are recorded
 accurately. In the national elections, the success
 of one major opposition party which doubled its represen-
 tation tends to support this belief. Likewise, in the
 recent state elections in Sarawak, the non-Malay opposition
 made substantial gains in'total popular vote, although this
 achievement was not reflected in seats won because of the
 division of electoral districts which has traditionally
 put non-Malays at a decided disadvantage.
 The position of women in Malaysian society is relatively
 unrestricted within the constraints of Islam and other
 Eastern cultures in the country. Women have full voting
 rights and enjoy legal rights to equal economic opportunity,
 although social custom in some ethnic groups often limits
 both in practice. At the educational level the Government
 encourages parity. For example, 50% of the University Law
 Faculty are women. The still small but increasing number
 of educated Malaysian women can readily find key positions
 in business, the professions, the Civil Service and politics.
 The Malaysian Government permits some trade union activity
 although labor legislation circumscribes union behavior.
 Some of these laws concerning collective bargaining (and
 the ISA itself) have brought Malaysia's implementation of
 ILO Conventions on Collective Bargaining and Forced Labor
 under ILO scrutiny. In 1979, the ILO noted that the National
 Joint Labor Advisory Council now had before it worker and
 employer proposals for amendment of the Industrial Relations
 Act of 1967 to broaden the scope of collective bargaining.
 There are some 350 trade unions with a total of about
 500,000 members. Most of the unions are members of the
 Malaysian Trade Union Congress, an active'member of the
 International Confederation of Free Trade Unions.
 Except when vital public services are involved, the
 freedom to strike exists and is used. The Malaysian
 Government recently invoked the ISA to arrest participants
 in a strike by union members against the national airline
 on the grounds that this constituted interference with an
 essential service. This rare occurrence provoked strong
 reactions both within Malaysia and abroad and all detainees
 were subsequently released.
 4.   Government Attitude and Record Regarding Inter-
 national and Non-Governmental investigations of
 Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Amnesty International has repeatedly called for the release
 of individuals detained without trial. The Malaysian Govern-
 ment permitted an Anesty international delegation to enter
 the country in 1978 and did not actively impede its
 investigation; it did not, however, extend much cooperation.
 The Amnesty delegation requested interviews with several
 responsible-level government officials but was allowed to
 meet only a senior civil servant in the Home Affairs Ministry.
 The delegation also complained that it was refused access
 to current detainees. The Amnesty International report and
 press articles reporting on it have been banned in Malaysia.
 In response to opposition questions regarding the Arnesty
 International report, the Government has declined to discuss
 it beyond declaring in mid-October 1979 that the ISA remains
 necessary and that there are no political prisoners in
 Malaysia. The Malaysian Bar Council report, which was
 critical of practices regarding detention under the ISA, has
 * been allowed to circulate freely and the Prime Minister
 addressed some of its criticisms in a recent address to
 the Bar Council.
