 GHANA
 On January 7, Flight Lieutenant (retired) Jerry John Rawlings, who had seized
 power from an elected government on December 31, 1981, became the first Presi-
 dent of the Fourth Republic, a nascent constitutional democracy. This trans-
 formation ended 11 years of authoritarian military rule by the Provisional National
 Defense Council (PNDC), under Rawlings' chairmanship, but it did not end con-
 troversy over the legitimacy of the new Government. Flight Lieutenant Rawlings
 won the November 1992 presidential election with 58 percent of the vote as the
 head of a three-party coalition led by his own National Democratic Congress (NDC).
 Despite irregularities, most notably an inaccurate voters' register, the international
 groups monitoring the election accepted the validity of the outcome. However, four
 opposition parties claimed massive fraud in the presidential election and boycotted
 the December 1992 parliamentary elections, leaving the President's coalition in full
 control of the Parliament and the Government.
 The new Constitution, which went into effect January 7, provides for a system of
 checks and balances, with an executive branch headed by the President, a unicam-
 eral Parliament, an independent judiciary, and several autonomous commissions,
 such as the Commission for Human Rights and Administrative Justice.
 The several security organizations report to various departments of government.
 The police are responsible for maintaining law and order and come under the juris-
 diction of an 8-member Police Council. The Bureau of National Investigation (BNI),
 under the Minister of Interior, handles most cases of a political nature.
 Although Ghana is attempting to rebuild its industrial base after years of eco-
 nomic mismanagement, more than 60 percent of the population still draws its liveli-
 hood from subsistence agriculture. Gold, cocoa (and cocoa products), timber, and en-
 ergy are major traditional sources of export revenues. Annual economic growth has
 averaged 4.5 percent since the inception of an economic recovery program in 1983,
 but there has been slow progress in privatizing the 181 state-owned enterprises.
 While it was too early to judge whether the rule of law and democracy would
 flourish in Ghana after 11 years of authoritarian rule, the human rights situation
 improved in 1993. The Government began a dialog with the main oposition party
 and there was widespread acceptance of and support for the new Constitution. It
 contains particularly strong provisions in support of human rights, and the inde-
 pendent press, human rights monitoring groups, opposition parties, and the judici-
 ary acted as vigilant constitutional watchdogs during the year. The Supreme Court,
 in particular, demonstrated independence from the executive in four cases involving
 opposition party grievances. Except for the journalist, Gershon Dompreh, who con-
 tinued to serve a prison sentence for "economic sabotage," there were no known po-
 litical detainees or prisoners being held by the authorities at years end. Societal dis-
 crimination and violence against women remained significant problems.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-Ther was one report of an
 extrajudicial killing. On July 6, the authorities arraigned a police inspector and a
 constable from Elmina police station on a charge of murder for the June 7 death
 of a prisoner who allegedly died as a result of a beating. The police officials were
 released on bail pending trial, which at year's end had still not taken place.
 At the urging of journalist and political activist Kwesi Pratt (see Section i.e.), the
 police expressed willingness to investigate allegations of extrajudicial killings in the
 early years of PNDC rule. Pratt was invited by the Commissioner of Police to assist
 in the investigations, and he agreed to provide the police with lists of names of vic-
 tims and the circumstances of their murder. At year's end, however, Pratt was still
 insisting upon the establishment of an independent committee of inquiry.
 b. Disappearance.-No politically motivated disappearances were reported.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution states that the dignity of all persons shall be inviolable and that
 no one shall be subjected to torture or other cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment
 or punishment, or any other condition that detracts from his dignity and worth as
 a human.
 There are occasional reports of police beating detainees. In the case noted above,
 a police inspector and a constable allegedly beat a suspect until he became uncon-
 scious; the suspect later died in the hospital.
 Prisons in Ghana are antiquated and seriously overcrowded. There were no re-
 ports of deaths caused by prison conditions.

 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The new Constitution provides protection
 against arbitrary arrest, detention, or exile and states that an individualdetained
 shall be informed immediately, in a language he understands, of the reasons for his
 detention and of his right to a lawyer and to an interpreter, the latter at state ex-
 pense. The detainee shall be arraigned within 48 hours.
 The court has unlimited discretion regardingthe setting of bail. It may refuse to
 release prisoners on bail and instead remand them without charge for an indefinite
 period, subject to weekly review by judicial authorities. However, the Constitution
 requires that a detainee who has not been tried within a "reasonable" time shall
 be released either unconditionally or subject to conditions necessary to ensure that
 he appears at a later date for court proceedings.
 As far as is known, after the release of many political detainees in 1992, the Gov-
 ernment held no political detainees at the end of 1993.
 The Government does not practice forced exile. In recent years, the Government
 has quietly encouraged Ghanaians, including dissidents with valuable skills, who
 are living abroad to return; in some cases the Government has offered amnesty.
 Some former government and PNDC officials have returned and resumed careers
 and political activities without difficulty.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The judiciary is in transition as the former public
 tribunals are being phased out as they finish pending cases. The Constitution estab-
 lishes two basic levels of courts: superior and lower. The superior cuurts include the
 Supreme Court, the Appeals Court, the High Court, and regional tribunals. Par-
 liament may decree lower courts or tribunals. The regional tribunals have not been
 created yet. The Constitution requires that the chairman of a regional tribunal be
 qualified to be a High Court judge, whereas the public tribunals depended largely
 on chairmen with little or no legal experience. A decision by a regional tribunal may
 be appealed to the Court of Appeal; whereas no appeals were permitted from the
 public tribunal until 1985, when the National Appeals Tribunal was created.
 Legal safeguards are based on British legal procedures. Defendants are presumed
 innocent, trials are public, and defendants have a right to be present, to be rep-
 resented by an attorney, to present evidence, and to cross-examine witnesses.
 The Constitution provides for a Commission for Human Rights and Administra-
 tive Justice to investigate alleged violations of human rights and take action to rem-
 edy proven violations. The Human Rights Commission was sworn in in October. By
 years end, it had begun hiring legal and investigative staff and recruiting for
 branch offices in all 10 regions of Ghana, and for some district offices in each of
 the 10 regions. The Commission has subpoena power. When the Commission finds
 evidence of a human rights violation or administrative injustice, it can seek resolu-
 tion through negotiation, by making its findings known to the superior of an offend-
 ing person or to the Attorney-General or Auditor-General, or by instituting court
 proceedings.
 The traditional courts will continue to operate alongside the regular courts. The
 Chieftaincy Act of 1971 gives village and other traditional chiefs powers in local
 matters, including authority to enforce customary tribal laws dealing with such mat-
 ters as divorce, child custody, and property disputes.
 In the past, there were grave doubts about the independence of the judiciary. The
 PNDC summarily dismissed judges, thereby reminding them that they served at the
 PNDC's sufferance. However, in the first year of the Fourth Republic, the judiciary
 exhibited the independence provided for in the Constitution. The Supreme Court
 ruled in favor of the major opposition party, the New Patriotic Party (NPP), in 4
 of 5 cases that it brought against the Government. A Supreme Court judge also
 granted the NPP an injunction ordering the Electoral Commission to delay the elec-
 tions of district chief executives pending a decision in another suit brought by the
 NPP.
 As far as is known, the Government had released most of its political prisoners
 by year's end. However, when Christian Chronicle editor George Naykene was re-
 leased in May, following 12 months in prison for criminal libel, he raised the case
 of journalist Gershon Dompreh, who he said had served 6 years of a 20-year prison
 sentence for "economic sabotage." According to Naykene, Dompreh's crime was pub-
 lishing information about a treaty between Ghana and Saudi Arabia.
 On December 17, 1992, the authorities arrested Kwesi Pratt and Professor Albert
 Adu-Boahen, leader of the New Patriotic Party, and charged them with obstructing
 a public tribunal for refusing to testify on the grounds that they did not consider
 the tribunal to be independent of government influence. Adu-Boahen and Pratt re-
 mained free awaiting trial, and in July the case was moved from the public tribunal
 to a regular court. At year's end it was still pending.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-Citizens
 engaged in activity deemed objectionable by the Government are subject to surveil-
 
 
 114
 lance. In the past, this included monitoring of telephones and mail. The Constitution
 provides that persons shall be free from interference within the privacy of their
 home, property, correspondence, or communication "except in accordance with the
 law and as may be necessary in a free and democratic society for public safety or
 the economic well-being of the country, for the protection of health or morals, for
 the prevention of disorder or crime or for the protection of the rights or freedoms
 of others." At year's end, it remained uncertain how the Government and the courts
 would interpret this broad article in practice.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-Freedom of speech is provided for in the Con-
 stitution, and this right has been used by the opposition parties, the Ghana Bar As-
 sociation (GBA), the National Union of Ghanaian Students (NUGS), and other non-
 overnmental organizations (NGO's). Since the beginning of the Fourth Republic,
 there have been no credible reports of government attempts to interfere with free
 speech, although government-run media have experienced some pressure for con-
 formity.
 The State dominates the print and electronic media. It owns the radio and tele-
 vision stations and the two daily newspapers. The official media accentuates the
 positive aspects of government policies, although it also covers selected instances of
 corruption or mismanagement in government ministries and state-owned enter-
 prises. In general, the state-owned media do not criticize government policies or
 President Rawlngs. Four journalists with the government-owned media were trans-
 ferred in 1993 to jobs that were seen as demotions. Many journalists and others be-
 lieve the transfers resulted from governmental displeasure with stories the journal-
 ists had written or produced. As a result of this perceived practice, self-censorship
 is a pattern in the official media, and writers, editors, and commentators recognize
 and rarely crss the boundary of acceptable reporting and commentary. There were
 occasions when the government-owned media carried editorials critical of the Gov-
 ernment, but no personal attacks were made on top officials.
 Most Ghanaians obtain their news from the government-ron electronic media and
 British Broadcasting Corporation radio. Under the Constitution, individuals are free
 to own radio and television stations. There have been several applications for li-
 censes to operate private radio stations. However, no licenses have been issued to
 date, and the electronic media remain a government monopoly.
 The independent press has multiplied with scores of new independent newspapers
 and magazines outspoken in their criticism of the Government, including personal
 attacks on the President, his wife, and his close advisers. However, the continued
 existence of the criminal libel law casts a shadow over freedom of the press, and
 the independent newspapers and magazines are small, poorly financed, and not
 widely distributed outside the capital. Most are weeklies or appear sporadically.
 While he was never charged, the editor of the Free Press was questioned by the po-
 lice concerning possible criminal libel charges resulting from an article accusing the
 Minister of Information and the First Lady of misusing government funds.
 Foreign periodicals are sold in Accra and other major cities. Issues containing ar-
 ticles critical of the Government circulate freely.
 The new Government has not suppressed freedom of speech, press, or academic
 freedom on university campuses. The NUGS, one of the more vocal critics of the
 Government, is allowed to organize and hold meetings (see Section 2.b.).
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-Freedom of peaceful assembly
 and association are provided for in the Constitution. In the past, demonstrations
 were generally allowed, but the organizers had to obtain a police permit, which was
 sometimes denied. In February police broke up a demonstration to protest the Gov-
 ernment's budget due to the organizers' failure to obtain a permit. The Supreme
 Court later ruled in a case brought by the NPP that no police permit is needed for
 demonstrations, parades, rallies, and other peaceful assemblies. The Government
 made significant efforts to publicize this ruling, and some demonstrations took place
 without permits.
 There were several student demonstrations critical of the Government, but the po-
 lice generally reacted with restraint. The exception was when the police reacted
 with excessive force to a student demonstration in March. One student was shot,
 but not seriously wounded, and several others were beaten. The police inquiry into
 the incident, while noting that the actions of the students were illegal, concluded
 that it was difficult to justify the use of force by the police. Releasing the report,
 the Minister of the Interior announced that all those who suffered injury during the
 violence would receive compensation from the Government. At year's end, however,
 no compensation had been paid, nor had any police been charged.
 
 
 115
 c. Freedom of Religion.-There is no state-favored religion and no apparent advan-
 tages or disadvantages attached to membership in any particular sect or religion.
 Just before the inauguration of Rawlings as President, the PNDC repealed the
 law requiring relgious organizations to register with the Government. The law had
 been opposed by t e Christian Council and the Catholic Secretariat, the two largest
 religious organizations in Ghana, and had been suspended for over a year pending
 review.
 Foreign missionary groups have generally operated throughout the country with
 a minimum of formal restrictions, although some churches continue to have dif-
 ficulty obtaining visas and residence permits for some of their expatriate mission.
 aries.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.--Ghanaians and foreigners are free to move throughout the country
 without special permission. Police checkpoints exist countrywide for the prevention
 of smuggling. However, following PNDC orders in 1992, most checkpoints are rou-
 tinely left unmanned during daylight hours. After a series of unresolved bombing
 incidents following the November 1992 presidential elections, the police stepped up
 daytime monitoring of checkpoints. Roadblocks and car searches are a normal part
 of nighttime travel in Accra.
 As members of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), Gha-
 naians may travel without visas for up to 90 days in member states. Ghanaians are
 generally free to exercise this right, and nationals of other member states are free
 to travel to Ghana. Ghanaians are also free to emigrate and to return from other
 countries.
 Ghana has been faced with a growing refugee population since Liberians fleeing
 civil war began to arrive in August 1990. By June Ghana was hosting some 20,000
 Liberian refugees. Most of the new refugee population, as well as many transiting
 third-country nationals also fleeing Liberia, were housed by the Government with
 assistance from the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in
 a camp 20 kilometers west of Accra. An undetermined number of refugees volun-
 tarily returned to Liberia. The estimated camp population was 13,000 at year's end.
 During periods of increased tension in Togo in 1993, as many as 150,000 Togolese
 fled their country to seek refuge in Ghana. They generally were received by rel-
 atives, and many moved back and forth repeatedly across the border. Most are ex-
 pected to return to their country voluntarily when the tension eases.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Ghanaians exercised their right to vote in 1992. The election outcomes were high-
 ly controversial. The Commonwealth Secretariat, the Carter Center, the Organiza-
 tion of African Unity, Canada, and members of the European Community sent ob-
 servers to the presidential elections in November. The observers noted significant
 poblems with the electoral process (especially involving the voter registration list)
 ut felt that the irregularities did not affect the outcome of the election. Rawlings
 won approximately 58 percent of the vote and the four opposition parties won rough-
 ly 42 percent.
 However, the opposition parties claimed that the presidential elections had been
 fraudulent, and, insisting that any subsequent election conducted under the same
 conditions would be equally unfair, the four opposition parties boycotted the Decem-
 ber parliamentary elections. As a result, there are no opposition party members in
 Parliament. Two seats were won by independent candidates; the three parties in the
 coalition supporting President Rawlings won the remaining 198 of the 200 par-
 liamentary seats, with the President's party winning 188.
 Thus, the Rawlings Government, while firmly in power, still faced a significant
 olitical problem of dealing with a large, bitter, extraparliamentary opposition. To
 elp bring the opposition into the political process, the Government promised to re-
 form the electoral system, especially the voters' register, prior to the 1996 elections.
 The NPP agreed to a dialog with the Government, and meetings took place in No-
 vember. At year's end, it was not clear whether the Government would follow
 through to meet the opposition parties' concerns.
 The Constitution prohibits discrimination on grounds of gender and there are no
 de jure obstacles to women or minorities participating in government. There are sev-
 eral female ministers, and several women are on the Council of State. Women make
 up 8 percent of the Parliament.
 
 
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Human rights organizations grew more numerous and vocal in 1993. Several, in-
 cluding the Committee on Human and People's Rights and the Ghana Bar Associa-
 tion Human Rights Committee, opened branch offices. A Human Rights Study Cen-
 ter was created at the law faculty at the University of Ghana at Legon, and human
 rights law took a more prominent place in the school's curriculum. Seminars were
 frequently held by various organizations to discuss human rights issues and often
 resulted in public criticism of the Government. The Government did not interfere
 with the activities of these groups.
 In the past, the PNDC frequently expressed displeasure at criticism of its human
 rights record from Ghanaian religious organizations and international human rights
 advocates. In 1992 it permitted international observers to monitor the elections. The
 Government permits prison visits by the International Committee of the Red Cross.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution prohibits discrimination on the basis of gender, race, color, eth-
 nic origin, religion, creed, or social and economic status. The courts are specifically
 empowered to enforce these prohibitions.
 Women.-Although the PNDC promulgated in 1985 four laws that overturned
 many of the customary, traditional, and colonial laws that discriminated against
 women, Ghanaian women remain subject to societal discrimination. Women in
 urban centers and those with skills and training encounter little overt bias, but re-
 sistance to women in nontraditional roles persists. Women in the rural agricultural
 sector remain subject to traditional male dominance and bear the brunt of difficult
 labor conditions.
 Violence against women (including rape and wife beating) is a significant problem.
 Police do not normally intervene in domestic disputes, and such cases seldom come
 before the courts. In an effort to reduce the incidence of rape, the Government in-
 creased the minimum penalty for rape from 1 year to 3 years plus a fine or an addi-
 tional 3 years' imprisonment.
 The media sometimes reports cases of women who have been beaten, raped, or
 otherwise assaulted. Women's rights groups are active in educational campaigns
 and in programs to provide vocational training, legal aid, and other support to
 women. The Government is also active in educational programs in support of wom-
 en's rights.
 Children.-The Government hae. established a National Commission on Children
 which has instituted several programs, including efforts to improve the nutritional
 value of food for children, literacy courses, and establishment of parks and libraries
 for children. There are many NGO's that are active in health care and education
 for children.
 There is little or no discrimination against females in education, but girls and
 women frequently drop out due to societal, cultural, or economic pressures. Statis-
 tics show an equal male/female ratio in school enrollments in grade 1, but the ratio
 shifts to 2 to 1 against girls by grade 6, 4 to 1 at the secondary level, and 9 to 1
 at the universitylevel. The Government is testing programs to make it easier for
 girls to stay in school despite outside pressures to drop out.
 There are traditional discriminatory practices against females which are injurious
 to their health and development. In particular, the practice of female genital mutila-
 tion (circumcision) remains a serious problem. The Government has discouraged the
 practice in public educational campaigns but has not made it illegal. Although there
 are no precise statistics available, one independent expert estimates that as many
 as 30 percent of Ghanaian females have undergone this procedure. Local health offi-
 cials, however, believe the percentage is much lower. Such mutilation normally
 takes place at an early age and is practiced mostly in the far northeastern and
 northwestern parts of the country.
 Found primarily in the Volta(eastern) region, the tro-kosi, fetish slave, or "vestal
 virgin" system is a traditional practice whereby a young girl is made a virtual slave
 to a fetish shrine and priest for offenses committed by a member of the girl's family.
 While there is much secrecy surrounding the practice, the belief is that if someone
 in a family has committed a crime, such as stealing, members of the family may
 begin to die in large numbers unless a young girl is given to the local fetish shrine
 to atone for the offense. The girl becomes the virtual property of the fetish priest
 and may become his wife. The girls are seldom allowed to go to school and must
 work on the priest's farm and perform other labors for him. Wen the fetish slave
 dies or reaches maturity, the family is expected to replace her with another young
 girl for the fetish shrine. The practice is clearly against Ghanaian law. It persists,
 
 
 117
 however, because of traditional practice and deep-seated belief that families will suf-
 fer if the girls are not handed over. Several NGO's and the National Commission
 on Children have programs to provide education for the girls and there has been
 some minimal success in encouraging the substitution of sacrificial animals in place
 of girls. One estimate is that there may be 1,000 fetish slaves bound to various
 shrines.
 National /Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-Although ethnic differences are played down
 by the Government its opponents occasionally complain that it is dominated by the
 Ewe ethnic group from eastern Ghana. However, while President Rawlings and a
 number of his close advisers are Ewe, many ministers have other ethnic origins. The
 leaders of the National Democratic Congress sometimes claim that the other parties
 are "ethnic" parties and are attempting to arouse ethnic rivalry. Although the main
 opposition party has strong support among the Ashanti, overall the charges have
 little credibility.
 People with Disabilities.-The Constitution prohibits discrimination against the
 disabled. The Government has not enacted any legislation mandating accessibility
 for the disabled.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-This right is restricted as the Trades Union Ordi-
 nance confers broad powers on the Government to refuse to register a trade union.
 However, in practice the PNDC did not and the NDC Government to date has not
 interfered with the right of workers to associate in labor unions. Civil servants are
 prohibited by law from joining or organizing a trade union. However, on December
 30, 1992, the PNDC passed the Public Service Negotiating Committee Law (Law
 309, 1992), allowing each branch of the civil service to establish a negotiating com-
 mittee.
 About 10 or 15 percent of workers belong to unions. Trade unions and their activi-
 ties are still governed by the Industrial Relations Act (IRA) of 1965. The Trades
 Union Congress (TUC) is the only existing confederation, though it has no legal mo-
 nopoly. In recent years, it has been led by experienced union leaders who, aided by
 a revised union constitution and bylaws, continued to define an autonomous role for
 the TUC within the PNDC regime. During 1993 the TUC took a somewhat more
 confrontational stance vis-a-vis the Government and was quite critical of some of its
 economic policies.
 The right to strike is recognized in law, but a legal strike may be called only if
 negotiations and mediation fail. Because no union has ever gone through the com-
 plete process, there have been no legal strikes in Ghana since independence. Univer-
 sity teachers and Volta Aluminum Conpany workers staged major strikes in 1993.
 The IRA prohibits retribution against strikers, and this is enforced. There has been
 no progress in implementing the Government's declared intention to establish labor
 tribunals to arbitrate industrial disputes certified as deadlocked.
 The TUC is affiliated with the Organization of African Trade Union Unity,
 headquartered in Accra. In December 1992, the TUC was accepted as a member of
 the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The IRA provides a frame-
 work for collective bargaining and some protection against antiumon discrimination
 as well. Ghana's trade unions engage in collective bargaining for wages and benefits
 with both private and state-owned enterprises without government interference.
 However, the Government, labor, and employers negotiate together through a tri-
 partite commission to set minimum standards for wages and working conditions.
 Employers found guilty of antiunion discrimination are required to reinstate work-
 ers fired for union activities.
 There are no functioning export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The law prohibits forced labor,
 and it is not known to be practiced. However, the International Labor Organization
 (ILO) continues to urge the Government to revise various legal provisions that per-
 mit imprisonment with an obligation to perform labor for offenses that are not coun-
 tenanced under ILO Convention 105, ratified by Ghana in 1958.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-Labor legislation in Ghana sets
 a minimum employment age of 15 and prohibits night work and certain types of
 hazardous labor for those under 18. In practice, child labor is prevalent, andyoung
 children of school age can often be found during the day performing menial tasks
 in the market or collecting fares on local buses. Observance of minimum age laws
 is eroded by local custom and economic circumstances that encourage children to
 work to help their families. Violators of regulations prohibiting heavy labor and
 night work for children are occasionally punished. Inspectors from the Ministry of
 Lator and Social Welfare are responsible for enforcement of child labor regulatidons.
 
 
 118
 They visit each workplace annually and make spot checks whenever they receive al-
 legations of violations.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-In 1991 the PNDC government convened a tri-
 partite commission of representatives of government, lMbor, and employers which
 administratively set minimum standards for wages and working conditions. The
 minimum wage rate combines wages with customary benefits, such as a transpor-
 tation allowance. However, the existing daily minimum wage of roughly $0.95 (790
 cedis) is insufficient for a single wage earner to support a family. In most cases
 households are supported by multiple wage earners, some family farming, and other
 family based commercial activities.
 The maximum workweek, by law is 45 hours, with one break of at least 36 con-
 secutive hours every 7 days. Througi collective bargaining, however, the basic work-
 week for most unionized workers is 40 hours.
 Occupational safety and health regulations are in effect, and sanctions are occa-
 sionally applied through the Labor Department of the Ministry of Health and Social
 Welfare. However, safty inspectors are few in number and poorly trained. They will
 take action if matters are called to their attention but lack the resources to seek
 out violations. Workers have the right to withdraw themselves from dangerous work
 situations without jeopardy to continued employment.
