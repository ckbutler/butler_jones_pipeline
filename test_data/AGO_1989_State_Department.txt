 ANQOLA*
 The People's Republic of Angola (PRA) is ruled by the sole
 legal political party, the Marxist-Leninist Popular Movement
 for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA). President Jose Eduardo
 Dos Santos is both Head of State and chief of the MPLA. His
 rule was reconfirmed by the MPLA's Second Party Congress in
 December 1985. All major policy decisions are made by a small
 elite in the MPLA, which also controls all means of mass
 communication. Open political dissension is not tolerated.
 The Angolan armed forces (FAPLA) total approximately 100,000.
 FAPLA is backed by a lightIy armed People's Militia, which is
 used for counterinsurgency and defensive duties at the local
 level. The armed opposition, the National Union for the Total
 Independence of Angola (UNITA), is estimated to have a regular
 force of about 30,000, as well as a comparable number of
 irregular troops. It has the allegiance of a substantial
 portion of the population, especially among Angola's largest
 ethnic group, the Ovimbundu.
 UNITA controls the southeastern quarter of Angola's
 territory. The United States supports UNITA in the Angolan
 conflict and has provided it with assistance. The PRA
 receives extensive military assistance from the Soviet Union.
 As of November 1, 1989, half of the estimated 50,000 Cuban
 troops who were stationed in the country had been withdrawn in
 accordance with the New York accords of December 22, 1988.
 Under these agreements, Cuba is obligated to withdraw a total
 of 33,000 troops by April 1990, and all Cuban troops are to be
 out of Angola by July 1, 1991.
 A civil war, combined with a Communist command-style economy,
 has devastated the country's infrastructure, forced a return
 to barter in some areas, and led the PRA to divert much of its
 revenues to the military, including payments to the Soviet
 Union for military equipment and to Cuba for combat troops.
 Although the PRA receives substantial foreign exchange
 earnings from oil exports, the expenditure of hard currency
 for weapons and the impact of war on the productivity and
 distribution networks of Angolan agriculture appear to have
 created a chronic food shortage in both the cities and the
 countryside. The PRA, in response to the generally critical
 economic situation, announced in 1987 its intention to
 institute some market-oriented economic reforms. By the end
 of 1989, little progress had been made, although the
 International Monetary Fund voted in midyear to admit the PRA.
 The civil war between the PRA and UNITA has ravaged Angola
 since 1975 and has resulted in widespread human rights abuses
 on both sides with many civilian casualties. A regional
 conflict on Angolan and Namibian territory has added further
 destruction and violence. On December 22, 1988, the Republic
 of Cuba, the People's Republic of Angola, and the Republic of
 South Africa signed a series of agreements (the New York
 accords) under U.S. mediation which are leading to
 independence for Namibia in accordance with the U.N.
 Settlement Plan and the phased and total withdrawal of Cuban
 troops from Angola. This has significantly reduced regional
 The United States does not recognize or maintain diplomatic
 relations with the People's Republic of Angola and has no
 diplomatic personnel there to monitor human rights conditions
 or evaluate allegations of abuses.
 
 
 tensions. In June 1989, at Gbadolite, Zaire, President Dos
 Santos and Dr. Savimbi, leader of UNITA, agreed to a ceasefire
 and committed themselves to achieving national
 reconciliation. In the months thbt followed, the cease-fire
 broke down and fighting resumed with new charges of human
 rights abuses. In December the PRA, with the help of Soviet
 advisers, launched a new military offensive into UNITA-
 controlled areas of southeastern Angola. As the year ended,
 the U.S., Zaire, and other countries in the region were
 working to reestablish the cease-fire and get negotiations
 started to end the bivil war.
 One human rights group, Africa Watch, has estimated total
 civil war victims at 200,000 Angolans killed, more than 20,000
 children orphaned, and 20,000 to 50,000 Angolans left as
 amputees due to the widespread use of land mines by both
 sides. In addition to extensive violence-against civilians,
 human rights remained restricted across the board with
 problems of mistreatment of prisoners, arbitrary detentions,
 lack of fair trial, and restrictions on freedom of speech,
 press,.association, movement, worker rights, and the right of
 citizens to change their government.'
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 Reports of political killings on the part of PRA forces and
 UNITA, both in combat areas and in the form of summary .
 executions of prisoners, persisted in 1989. It is difficult
 to evaluate the various claims and counterclaims. The
 fighting also resulted in many civilian deaths. While some of
 these deaths were inadvertently caused by military operations,
 others may have been deliberately perpetrated by opposing
 forces to intimidate civilian populations. The PRA and UNITA
 publicly and repeatedly accused each other of practicing
 terrorism against their respective opponents, including
 killing or maiming civilians.
 UNITA has charged that Cuban forces have been involved in
 attacks on civilians. In addition, UNITA has asserted that
 FAPLA and Cuban forces used aerial chemical warfare against
 military and civilian opponents in 1989. Tests carried out by
 American forensic experts, however, did not yield postive
 results.
 b. Disappearance
 There is no information either to confirm or deny that secret
 arrests or clandestine detentions are practiced by PRA
 security agencies or by UNITA, although each side has accused
 the other of such practices.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Allegations of torture and mistreatment made by both sides
 appear to have some basis in fact, but torture of opponents
 does not appear to be a generalized systematic practice of
 either PRA organizations or UNITA. The number of torture
 allegations against UNITA increased in 1989. Little
 information is available on the administrative structure and
 
 
 S
 ANGLA
 practices within UNITA-held areas. Reports that UNITA
 mistreats some prisoners could-neither be confirmed nor
 disproved.
 PRA prison authorities reportedly have wide latitude in the
 treatment of prisoners. Treatment of political detainees in
 the prisons controlled by the PRA Ministry of State Security
 appears to be harsher than treatment in the regular prisons.
 There are reports of sexual torture of UNITA prisoners and
 mistreatment, including beatings, threats, and prolonged
 interrogation with the use of force. Family visits appear to
 be arbitrarily restricted in many instances. In 1989 foreign
 advisers, including Cubans and East Germans, continued to
 assist PRA state security services and may have helped operate
 the state security prisons. AI's 1989 Report notes that three
 former security officials were convicted of ill-treating
 prisoners during 1988 (nine were tried).
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Under laws enacted by the PRA, persons suspected of committing
 serious acts against "state security" may be held by the
 Ministry of State Security without charge for an initial
 period of 3 months, renewable for a further period of 3
 months. Such detainees need not be presented to a judge
 within 48 hours of their arrest, as stipulated in the Code of
 Criminal Procedure for persons suspected of other kinds of
 crime, and apparently have no right to challenge the grounds
 of their detention. After 6 months in detention without
 charge, the detainee must be informed of the accusations, with
 the State Security Service either informing the public
 prosecutor of the charges or releasing the suspect. Once the
 case is presented to the public prosecutor, there does not
 appear to be a specific time limit within which a suspect must
 be brought to trial.
 The deterioration of the security situation has exacerbated
 the general decline in judicial safeguards and due process.
 The PRA has established regional military councils throughout
 much of Angola. They are responsible directly to President
 Dos Santos and have broad authority to restrict the mpvement
 of people and goods, to requisition people and goods without
 compensation, and to try crimes against "state security." The
 MPLA has also created "People's Vigilance Brigades" for urban
 areas, whose powers are not clear but which include general
 administration and "protecting the people and ensuring public
 order and stability."
 Press accounts alleged that UNITA had detained or executed
 Pedro "Tito" Chingunji, a former UNITA representative in the
 United States, at the beginning of the year. Chingunji was
 later seen alive and apparently well in Jamba, UNITA's
 headquarters in southeastern Angola.
 The number of political detainees and prisoners held by the
 PRA at the end of 1989 was not known. However, the PRA
 claimed to have released 700 political prisoners during the
 first 6 months of the year. If this figure is correct, it
 appears that the MPLA has been holding many more regime
 opponents than previously believed.
 With regard to forced or compulsory labor, see Section 6.c.

 ANGLA
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Although the PRA Constitution provides for an independent
 judiciary, in practice the judiciary follows MPLA party
 guidelines. The Constitution also states that no citizen
 shall be arrested and brought to trial except under the terms
 of the law, which includes a public trial and the right of the
 accused to legal counsel. There is, however, insufficient
 information to determine if, or to what extent, these rights
 are observed in practice in regurar criminal and civil cases.
 In thepast, AI has expressed concern that trials of political
 opponents -of the PRA, notably in military tribunals, do not
 conform to internationally recognized standards. AI's 1989
 report'notes that 20 defendants convicted in 198P for ties to
 UNITA were not given adequate opportunity to present their
 defense or to appeal their cases. AI also reported the 1989
 conviction of two Military pilots on espionage charges. They
 were sentenced to death and not permitted to appeal.
 Judicial lines of authority are unclear, especially since the
 PRA's regional military councils have been given
 responsibility for the trial of offenses against "state
 security," including;"economic crimes."- It is not known which
 trials are open to the public and under what rules of
 procedure the various military and civilian courts operate.
 The PRA Constitution also provides for a People's Supreme
 Court,,but no information is available about its jurisdiction.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Although the Constitution provides for the inviolability of
 the home and privacy of correspondence, the PRA conducts
 arbitrary searches of homes, censors private correspondence,
 and monitors private communications.
 g. Use of Excessive Force and Violations of Humanitarian
 Law in Internal Conflicts
 The resumption of the conflict in August, after the breakdown
 of the June cease-fire, led to some of the most violent
 fighting in 1909. Displaced persons interviewed in UNITA
 territory have stated that FAPLA forces capture escaping
 civilians, particularly children, and send them to special
 camps within PRA territory or to Communist countries such as
 Cuba and East Germany for "reeducation."
 New York Times reporter Kenneth Noble visited Samba Caju (180
 miles east of Luanda) as part of a group of reporters taken to
 the town by PRA authorities. There he conducted interviews
 with townspeople under PRA auspices. He wrote that UNITA
 soldiers invaded the town on September 17, 1989, shooting
 civilians (at least 15 were killed and 40 wounded) and
 destroying shops, houses, and a medical clinic.
 Africa Watch reports that some of the refugees interviewed by
 its representatives stated that UNITA captured civilians,
 transported them to UNITA territory, and forced them to farm.
 The PRA and UNITA have accused each other of placing land
 mines in footpaths to agricultural fields as part of a
 strategy to deny food to civilians in contested areas.
 Thousands of civilians have lost limbs as a result of the
 widespread use of land mines. According to the Africa Watch
 
 
 10
 ANGOLA
 study, mines placed by FAPLA forces accounted for most
 civilian casualties in northern Angola, while UNITA-placed
 mines were blamed for civilian casualties in eastern Angola.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The PRA Constitution provides for freedom of expression, but
 the Angolan people live under censorship, intimidation, and
 control of the media. Opposition views are not tolerated, and
 critics such as Bartolomeu Dias Fernandes, who was accused of
 "insulting the Head of State," have been sentenced to long
 prison terms.
 Although the PRA is especially sensitive to criticism in the
 foreign press, in 1986 it began to allow the controlled travel
 of foreign correspondents to Angola, a practice which
 continued in 1989. The circulation of Western journals and
 periodicals in PRA-controlled Angola is tightly restricted.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Although the PRA Constitution calls for freedom of assembly,
 it is denied to any political group or movement other than the
 MPLA or its associated mass organizations. All other
 political movements have been banned. There are numerous
 unconfirmed reports of arrests of people who voice support for
 opposition movements or alternative political systems. The
 People's Vigilance Brigades, which have some law enforcement
 authority in urban areas, and the martial law climate
 throughout the country tend further to restrict freedom of
 assembly and association.
 For a discussion of freedom of association as it applies to
 labor unions, see Section 6.a.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Although the PRA Constitution provides for the inviolability
 of freedom of conscience and belief and for separation of
 church and state, the PRA authorities publicly emphasize the
 importance of propagating atheism and have been critical of
 religious activities. Approximately 85 percent of the Angolan
 population is either Roman Catholic or Protestant, while the
 remainder practice a variety of animist beliefs. Systematic
 persecution of priests, pastors, and catechists and
 confiscation of Church property occurred in PRA-controlled
 areas between 1975 and 1979, but since then the PRA has eased
 its antireligious stance and has not moved to close down
 officially recognized churches. Church services are held
 regularly, and there is wide attendance.
 Foreign and Angolan missionaries are allowed to carry out
 their normal activities. UNITA respects freedom of religion
 in the areas it controls and provides limited administrative
 support to both Catholic and Protestant churches. In the
 past, UNITA has captured foreign missionaries in contested
 areas and released them unharmed after publicly warning them
 of the dangers of being caught in the combat zone.
 The PRA refuses to recognize smaller religious sects that it
 deems subversive, such as the Jehovah's Witnesses. The most
 recent known case of repression concerns the Tocoist Church,
 founded in Angola in 1949, which has a syncretic blend of
 
 
 11
 ANGOLA
 Christian beliefs and indigenous religious practices. The
 Government banned the Church in 1977, and, in early 1987,
 approximately 60'ToCoists were killed in a confrontation with
 irregular units-of the MIPLA military and state security
 forces. Although this ban was lifted in 1988,'there were
 reports of more arrests of members in that year.
 d. - Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 As a retult of the fighting and the widespread use of land
 mines by both sides, travel by road in most areas of Angola is
 dangerous. The PRA is acutely sensitive about security and
 has tightly restricted travel.  It'has also instituted a pass
 system'within Angola, and foreigners are generally prohibited
 from trbveling outside the principal cities. UNITA has
 publicly warned that it considers all of Angola to be a war
 zone and that it cannot guarantee the safety of persons
 traveling there.
 Angolan citizens are allowed to travel abroad, but'this travel
 is carefully controlled'by the PRA's restrictions on issuance
 of passports and exit visas and by currency restrictions.
 Emigration is restricted. The PRA limits travel to Angola
 through a selective and stringent visa policy.
 An estimated. 670,000 persldns , afidprobably - greater
 proportion of the Angolan p6pulation of 8 t6 9 million, have
 been displaced internally. Africa Watch reports that the PRA
 authorities'have forcibly displaced thousands of civilians, in
 part to deny UNITA a social base, ahd that UNITA has captured
 thousands of civilians and forced them to work on UNITA farms.
 There are some 400,000 Angolan refugees-resident in
 neighboring countries. Approximately 300,000 Angolans are
 still refugees in Zaire, and an'estimated 94,000 are in
 Zambih . There are approximately' 11,000 Zairian refugees or
 displaced persons in Angola. Namibian refugees have'beei
 repatriated 6s a result of the Net4 York accords, which also
 led to the departure of a-large contingent of South African
 nationals affiliated with the AfricarV*National Congress.
 By the end of September,1989, approximately 2,100 Angolan
 refugees were repatriated from Zaire to the PRA and nearly
 1,900 Zairian refugees returned home from the PRA. This
 repatriation, sponsoted by the United Nations High
 Commissioner for Refugees, was intended to return 5,000
 refugees to their homes--2,500 from each country--by late
 November 1989; A new registration for other refugees wishing
 to return home was expected to begin in January 1990.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Angolans do not have the right to change their government.
 Most of Angola is ruled by a small group of officials within
 the party apparatus of the ruling MPLA. The PRA Constitution
 provides for popular participation in the political process,
 but political activity is limited to participation in the MPLA
 or in one of its controlled and sanctioned organizations such
 as its youth wing, the Angolan Women's Organization, or the
 trade union movement. Political power is centdred in the
 elite membership of the Politburo and the somewhat larger
 Central Committee. Party membership is very restricted, with
 fewer than 30,000 members.
 
 
 ANGOLA
 The PRA Constitution provides for a popularly elected National
 People's Assembly, established in 1981, and people's
 assemblies at the provincial and local level. However,
 despite recent suggestions from President Dos Santos that the
 powers and membership of the National People's Assembly be
 broadened, only candidates chosen and endorsed by the MPLA
 have been elected. Key members of the party also hold
 leadership positions in the provincial and local assemblies.
 A new round of elections is planned for 1990 under the
 existing restrictions, but depending upon progress in the
 negotiations between the MPLA and UNITA, this may be subject
 to change.
 Both the MPLA and UNITA have primarily ethnic bases of
 support--the MPLA among the Mbundu, and UNITA among the
 Ovimbundu, Ganguela, and Lunda-Chokwe. The National Front for
 the Liberation of Angola (FNLA) has its base among the
 Bakongo, but the FNLA is no longer a major force in Angolan
 politics and has in part been integrated into the MPLA.
 Members of all of Angola's ethnic groups and religions
 participate in both organizations, some at high levels of the
 party. However, non-Mbundu groups are greatly
 underrepresented in the small group within the ruling PRA
 Central Committee and Politburo. Mesticos (Angolans of mixed
 racial background numbering only about 1 percent of the
 population) remain the most highly skilled and educated group
 in Angola and are influential--politically, culturally, and
 economically--beyond their numbers in the PRA.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The PRA did not respond to AI's 1987 appeal for information
 concerning numerous political detainees, .and neither the PRA
 nor UNITA would let Africa Watch researchers into the country
 in 1989 (Africa Watch's report was based on interviews with 87
 Angolan refugees in camps in Zaire and Zambia). The PRA has
 allowed the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC),
 the United Nations Children's Fund, and Catholic Relief
 Services to provide food assistance in areas it controls.
 UNITA allows the ICRC, Medicins Sans Frontieres, and Operation
 Handicapped International to conduct similar operations in
 areas under its control. Neither the PRA nor UNITA have yet
 responded to ICRC requests for access to all persons arrested
 in connection with internal events and the military situation
 in the country.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Because of the disturbed situation prevailing in most of
 Angola, there is little information available on the existence
 or extent of discrimination on the basis of race, sex,
 religion, language, or social status. There is also no
 information available on the extent of violence against women
 in Angola. Given the country's 500-year colonial legacy,
 Portuguese is the official language of Angola.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Angolan workers do not have the right to form independent
 trade unions. The sole, legally recognized, trade union
 
 
 13
 ANGOLA
 organization in the PRA is the National Union of Angolan
 Workers-(UNTA), which was formed in the late 1950's as an
 appendage of the HPLA and became the ruling party's official
 laborwWing after Angolan independence in 1975. The
 preindependence labor centers of rival liberation
 organizations ceased to exist soon after the MPLA took control
 of most of the country., The monopoly situation of the UNTA is
 ensurediby the statutory basis of the single-union structure.
 In addition, the activities of the labor central and its
 affiliates are tightly controlled by the MPLA. Strikes are
 illegal -andconsidered to be a crime against "state security."
 The PRA has ratified ILO Conventions 87 and 98 regarding
 freedom of association and collective bargaining. The UNTA is
 affiliated with the continent-wide Organization of African
 Trade Union Unity and the Communist-controlled World
 Federation of Trade Unions.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 Workers do not have the right to bargain collectively. The
 PRA, through its Ministry of Labor and Social Security,
 controls the process of setting wages and benefits, but it
 coordinates its actions with UNTA and employers. There are no
 exportoprocessing-.zones in Angola. As far as is known, labor
 legislation is applied uniformly throughout the PRA.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Existing ,PRA legislation authorizes compulsory labor for
 breaches of labor discipline and participation in strikes. On
 the basis of this legislation, the International Labor
 Organization (ILO) in 1984 cited the PRA for being in
 violation of ILO Convention 105, which prohibits forced
 labor. Also, in 1988 the ILO Committee of Experts cited the
 PRA for its failure to bring its legislation into conformity
 with ILO Convention 105, which the PRA- had ratified in 1976.
 During 1989, both the PRA and UNITA accused each other of
 relying on forced conscription of young males for recruitment
 into the military forces.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 There is no information available on this subject.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 There is also no information available on this subject.
