 GEORGIA
 Georgia declared its independence from the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics on
 April 9, 1991. In early January 1992, Zviad Gamsakhurdia, who was popularly
 elected President in 1991 largely on the strength of his record as an anti-Soviet dis-
 sident, was overthrown after his increasingly dictatorial rule led to an armed insur-
 rection. A Military Council of insurrection leaders assumed power and imposed a
 state of emergency and curfew in Tbilisi, the capital, and certain other areas. In
 April, at the invitation of the Military Council, former Soviet Foreign Minister and
 former First Secretary of the Georgian Communist Party Eduard Shevardnadze re-
 turned to Georgia. In an effort to establish a responsible government, he set up the
 State Council, a civilian legislative body, and was elected Chairman of its four-mem-
 ber executive Presidium. Acknowledging that this Government lacked legitimacy,
 Shevardnadze committed it to holding democratic elections.
 Shevardnadze's return did not lead to national reconciliation among the 5.5 mil-
 lion people of Georgia, as had been hoped. The country was wracked by separatist
 conflicts in South Ossetia and Abkhazia, as well as violence connected with support-
 ers of the ex-president, known as Zviadists. The Zviadists held demonstrations
 throughout the winter and spring and sometimes engaged in violent subversive ac-
 tivities, including attacks on railroads, bombings, robberies, assassination attempts,
 and kidnapings. In Mengrelia, a Zviadist stronghold in western Georgia, the Gov-
 ernment responded to armed action by Zviadist bands by sending in National Guard
 troops and members of the Mkhedrioni, a paramilitary group. Each side accused the
 other of engaging in criminal activity. Zviadists briefly seized the Tbilisi television
 station in a failed attempt to seize power in June. In early July, Zviadists in
 Mengrelia kidnaped the Deputy Prime Minister and head of the Commission on
 Interethnic Relations and Human Rights and held him for over a month before re-
 IaAnnni  him.

 South Ossetia's armed ethnic conflict, which began in 1989, continued until nego-
 tiations among Georgia, Russia, and the Ossetians in June led to a largely success-
 ful cease-fire and the introduction of a trilateral peacekeeping force. However, in the
 autonomous region of Abkhauia, increasing political tensions led to a controversial
 resolution passed by the Abkhazian minority in the regional parliament restoring
 the constitution of 1925, under which Abkhazia was a separate Union republic, an
 action widely interpreted as signifying Abkhaia's secession from Georgia. Under
 the 1978 Abkhaz Constitution, wvhich was intended to be superseded by this act, the
 Abkhaz Autnomsous Soviet Socialist Republic was a uonstituent part of Georgia.
 The Georgian State Council promptly ruled the Abkha resolution null and void.
 A period of relative calm, highhghted by Shevardnadze's August 4 announcement
 of total amnesty for beth armed and political opponents of the current Government,
 ended on August 14 when Zviadista kidnaped 11 senior Georgian officials, including
 the Interior Minister. The central Government sent a large armed force into
 Mengrelia to find the hostages, secure rail lines, and bring order to the Republic.
 The troops almost immediately moved north into Abkhazia to secure rail lines and
 in pursuit of the hostages thought to be held in that region. The troops allegedly
 had the concurrence of Abkhazian authorities. Hostilities erupted, however, when
 Abkhazian guards, strengthened by an influx of Caucasian "volunteers" from the
 Russian Federation, met the Georgians with force. Though casualty figures are un-
 certain, several hundreds on both sides are thought to have perished. A September
 3 cease-fire and political agreement went unobserved by Abkhazin and Russian
 Federation and other foreign combatants, and armed conflict continued through the
 end of the year.
 Despite these handicaps, the State Council successfully conducted nationwide
 elections on October 11 in 75 of 84 election districts. Voters elected 225 parliamen-
 tary deputies and, in a separate race in which no one stepped forward to challenge
 him, Shevardnadze was elected Chairman of the Parliament, in effect, Head of
 State. Despite widespread minor technical violations, a few credible reports of at-
 tempted voter manipulation, and arrests of a number of Zviadists just before elec-
 tion day, international observers characterized the elections as a valid exercise of
 free choice outside of the nonvoting areas in Abkhazia, Mengrelia, and South
 Ossetia. The new Parliament, which opned on November 4 passed a temporary law
 on the allocation of powers which made Shevardndze Hea of State with wide pow-
 ers that did not,however, include the power to dismiss Parliament. It also made Par-
 liament a strong entity entitled to review the work of government ministers. How-
 ever, Georgia has yet to adopt a new constitution that will determine the permanent
 distribution of gevenen   powers.
 The State Council's plans or the cration of a single, unified Georgian army were
 derailed by the hostilities in Abkhzia. The National Guard, the largest single
 armed force in Georgia, is commanded by Tengiz Kitovani, Presidium member and
 Defense Minister. In addition, the Mkhedrioni (cavalry"), is the most prominent
 among several active paramilitary groupa. The National Guard and, especially, the
 Mkhedrioni were accused of excesses and human rights abuses, charges they denied.
 In May, the State Council abolished the Security Ministry (which had re laced the
 Committee for State Security or KGB) and established the Intelligence and Informa-
 tion Service headed by a nointelligence professional. Many ex-KGB officers, how-
 ever, are thought to have been retained. The agency was involved in the arrests of
 some pro-Gamsakhurdia individuals accused of involvement in subversive or terror-
 ist activity.
 Georgia is in the initial stages of transition from a centrally planned to a free
 market economy, although progress has been hampered by serious political instabil-
 ity. Georgians experienced a dramatic decline in their standards of living in 1992,
 with a drop in gross domestic' product from the previous year that was expected to
 rach 30 percent and an inflation rate currently running at an estimated 500 per-
 cent annually. Although there are few reliable statistics, unemployment clearly has
 increased significantly as a result of industrial slowdown. Georgia still uses the
 ruble as its national currency, despite an interest in adopting its own currency.
 The armed conflicts in South Osstia and Abkhazia prompted allegations of
 human rights violations on all sides. Law enforcement officials were credibly ac-
 cused of human rights violations, including arrests without warrant, the physical
 abuse of detainees, and detention without formal charges beyond legal limits. Free-
 dom of speech and press was severely circumscribed, especially for Zviadists, and
 government supporters, including paramilitary groups, took to policing the media.
 Aian on demonstrations during the first half of 1992 was replaced by a law requir-
 ing only 48-hour notice for public gatherings. Freedom of religion and movement
 were generally respected.

 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There appears to have been at least
 one politically motivated extrajudicial killing in 1992, and several others, if not offi-
 dadly authorized, may well have been prompted by political enmities. (For fatalities
 related to the fighting in Abkhazia and South Ossetia, see Section 1.g.) No perpetra-
 tors were convicted, and in some cases no investigations were opened.
 In February the son of a prominent pro-Gamsakhurdia newspaper editor was
 found hanged in Tbilisi. The young man, an artist, had spent a short time sketching
 the fighters in Gamsakhurdia's bunker during the armed insurrection. He was ques-
 tioned by members of the procuracy shortly before he was found dead. The
 procuracy's investigation concluded that the victim committed suicide, but many be-
 ieve that he was killed in an act of political retribution. One of Gamsakhurdia's
 personal secretries was killed in February in Mengrelia. News reports at the time
 said she was caught in crossfire in a conflict zone, but some Zviadists believe she
 was personally targeted.
 Beginning in late spring, Mkhedrioni members were the victims of attacks that
 were probably politically motivated. In June, two Tbilisi car-bombings targeted
 Mkhedrioni chief Djaba Ioseliani and a senior aide. The aide was killed, and, in the
 second bombing, a mistimed explosion killed five innocent bystanders. The govern-
 ment investigation implicated proGamsakhurdia forces, and several suspects were
 arrested. They remain in detention pending completion of the investigation.
 A Mkhedrioni member was kidnaped in Tbilisi in July and found murdered soon
 after. The perpetrators have not been identified. A senior Mkhedrioni official who
 headed the intelligence service's economic crimes division, and another Mkheiarioni
 member were shot to death in August by a police officer while attemptingto inves-
 tigate the beatings of Mkhedrioni members at the police officer's precinct. Thelice
 officer is no longer at his old position but has apparently not been arrested.  in-
 vestigation is under way.
 b Disappearance.-There were no cases of unexplained disappearances reported
 in 1992; however, an ethnic Ossetian activist who disappeared in Tbilisi in 1991 is
 still missing.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The beatings of detainees by law enforcement officials is apparently routine, though
 unauthorized. It appears that investigating officials sometimes resort to physical
 abuse, includin severe beatings, to extract information or force confessions. Mem-
 bers of the police, paramilitary groups, National Guard, intelligence service, and
 procuracy have been accused of reliance on physical abuse in their work.
 The most public discussion of such practices erupted in August when the intel-
 ligence chief publicly announced his intent to resign after having learned that offi-
 cials in his agency had tortured a suspect in their custody. The victim, a suspect
 in the June car-bombing incidents had been burned and beaten, suffering multiple
 broken bones and a concussion. Te victim subsequently denied to a governmental
 human rights commission investigating the issue and to other questioners that he
 had been tortured, insisting that he had poured hot water on himself and had suf-
 fered other injuries when jumping from a car. Many political and human rights ob-
 servers did not find his denial credible and believe it was prompted by fear of fur-
 ther reprisal. Police beatings of teenaged boys, frequently detained without war-
 rants on suspicion of committing a crime, were a disturbing pattern in 1992.
 The new Government alleged that Gamsakhurdia forces beat prisoners in their
 bunker before their defeat on January 6, and reliable sources judge that at least
 some beatings did occur. Pro-Gamakhurdia forces claim that both law enforcement
 professionals and paramilitary groups beat persons detained for political reasons, in-
 cluding participation in antigovernment demonstrations.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-For the most part, Soviet-era legislation
 and practices with regard to arrest and detention continue in effect in Georgia.
 Under existing law, an arrest order issued by a procurator is required for arrests.
 A separate warrant, also issued by a procurator, is required for a search. If a person
 is caught committing a crime, he may legally be detained without a warrant. How-
 ever, the law obliges the detaining officer to inform a procurator of the detention
 immediately and to obtain an arrest order as soon as possible. A person may be le-
 gally detained for 72 hours without an arrest order, but the procurator must issue
 either an arrest order or an order for the prisoner's release upon expiration of that
 period. If held over for further investigation, a detainee must be formally charged
 with a crime within 10 days. A detainee may ask the procurator to determine if his
 detention is legal, a riuht that is sometimes exercised.
 
 
 777
 A detainee has the right to demand immediate access to a lawyer and to refuse
 a statement in the absence of counsel. The detaining officer must inform the de-
 tainee of those rights and must notify his family of the detainee's location as soon
 as possible. A suspect has the right to demand the presence of counsel during all
 questioning, and the presence of an attorney is mandatory during interrogation of
 a minor or of a person accused of a capital crime. The presence of a teacher or a
 parent is also obligatory dring questioning of a minor.
 A prson may be administratively detained without a warrant for several offenses,
 including participating in an illega1demonttien and curfew violation. The detain-
 officer must send case nmterals to a judge within 3 hours, and the udge must
 then decide the case within 24 hours. There is no formal tria, althou  the judge
 should consult with the accused and witnesses, ask the accused if he wants a law-
 yer, and then rule on the case. The maxinmm sentence is 16 days.
 Law enforcement personnel often ignore these legal protections in practice, and
 paramilitary groups who arbitrarily detained people in 1992 certainly ignored them.
 Authorities often detain people and search homes without warrants and frequently
 exceed time limits for detention and charging without seeking the required author-
 izations. Persons do not always have access to a lawyer or reject hiring a lawyer
 because they are not aware of their rights. The authorities frequently d not notify
 families Of the whereabouts of their detained relatives. Instances of such abuses of
 the law reportedly involve both political and nonpolitical prisoners.
 The authorities also frequently violated the system of protection for administra-
 tive violations. The administrative detention process is often used as a mechanism
 for short-term politically motivated detentions. In one case a number of former par.
 liamentary deputies under Gamsakhurdia were arrested for violating curfew when
 they returned from a session of the ousted parliament held across the border in the
 Russian Federation. Paramilitary groups, particularly the Mkhedrioni, reportedly
 relied widely on detentions for political reasons. Especially in the first half of the
 year, the Mkhedrioni appeared to operate with impunity, intimidating and detaining
 Zviadists or suspected Zviadists without legal sanction. Members of the Nationa
 Guard were also thought to engage in such actions. For their part, Zviadists en-
 gaged in kidnaping and hostagetking throughout the first half or the year.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-Pohtical instability has thus far hampered the ef-
 fective rule of law. Georgia's legal structure is a hybrid of laws from Georgia's brief
 period of pre-Soviet independence, the Soviet era, the Gamsakhurdia presidency,
 and the State Council period. The court system consists of district courts, a city
 court for Tbilisi, and the Supreme Court of the Republic. The two autonomous re-
 publics within Georgia have their own supreme courts, theoretically subordinate to
 the Georgia Supreme Court.
 In theory, Georgian citizens are by law guaranteed the right to a fair public trial
 at which defendants have the right to be present. They have the right to an attorney
 immediately after arrest, at public expense if needed. They are entitled to confront
 prosecution witnesses and present witnesses and evidence on their behalf. There is
 a presumption of innocence, and defendants have the right to appeal to either the
 procuracy or the Supreme Court. Work on judicial reform proceeded only half-
 heartedly during the interim governmental period; it remains to be seen how quick-
 ly it will progress. The judiciary's independence is limited by certain supervisory
 rights over its functions exercised by the procuracy, although the Supreme Court
 has issued several proclamations that attempt to assert its independence. As part
 of the Soviet-era system still practiced in Georgia, the procuracy has the right to
 suggest that the Supreme Court review one of its own decisions. By contrast, the
 judiciary has little influence over the procuracy. Moreover particularly at the local
 level, the judiciary is believed to be vulnerable to political or other forms of influ-
 ence.
 In 1992 there was also a pattern of judicial delay in processing politically related
 cases, none of which actually came to trial. Although the law aows pretrial deten-
 tion of up to 18 months, the accused in certain high-profile cases were held for less-
 er periods of time    and  released  either pending  or without trial. Both
 Gamsakhurdia's Minister of Finance and the Chairman of the Budget Commmittee
 were arrested after the President's overthrow, eventually charged with embezzle-
 ment and corruption, and released without trial under the Government's August 4
 amnesty.
 It is difficult to estimate the number of political prisoners in Georgia. The Govern-
 ment denies holding any political prisoners and states that all those held were or
 are criminals or terrorists, such as those arrested for attempting the violent over-
 throw of the interim government in June 1992. Pro-Gamsakhurdia and other opposi-
 tion figures interpret the August 4 manifesto and amnesty as proof that there were
 volitical prisoners in Georgia. Sixty prisoners were released as a result of the mani-
 
 
 778
 festo, most of them detained in connection with the June 24 attempt to seize power.
 As of October 31 Georgian authorities reported that they held 46 prisoners arrested
 for sabotage, including the June car-bombings, and for other plots to commit terror-
 ism or sabotage.
 Zviadist forces contend that many people were detained solely for political reasons
 for periods usually varying from 3 days to 1 month. They all  as man as 5,000
 such arrests, but published lists of alleged detainees include only hundrs, a figure
 that appears far more credible. Government sources report their investigation of
 such lists failed to substantiate most cases, but it is probable that such investiga-
 tions are not thorough and that security forces at times withhold information from
 other governmental authorities. While real numbers are difficult to confirm, illegal
 and politically motivated detentions have occurred. Both the October elections
 which the Zviadists strenuously opposed, and the June attempt to seize power led
 to detentions. According to the Government, most of the arrests related to the elec-
 tions were intended to prevent agitation against, or violent disruption of, the elec-
 tions.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-Intel-
 ligence agencies are widely believed to monitor telephone conversations. They also
 conduct surveillance, according to the Zviadists. Entry into homes without judicial
 sanction by both paramilitary orces and law enforcement representatives is report-
 edly widespread. Some Soviet-era forms of interference, however, have diminished.
 Radio and television broadcasts are no longer jammed, and receipt of foreign publi-
 cations is unimpeded.
 g. Use of Excessive Force and Violations of Humanitarian Law in Internal Con-
 flicts.-Armed conflict continued in the former South Ossetian Autonomous Oblast
 (province) for nearly 3 years until the signing of the June 24 Dagomys accord estab-
 lishing a cease-fire and a tripartite (Russian, Georgian and Ossetian) peacekeeping
 force in the region. Prior to the largely successful implementation of the cease-fire,
 Georgian and Ossetian forces had shelled civilian targets. Each side accused the
 other of taking hostages, and many Georgian and Ossetian civilians died. In May,
 36 South Ossetian civilians, including women and children were murdered while
 traveling along a road near the South Ossetian capital of Tskhinvali. The Georgian
 authorities immediately condemned the incident and pledged to bring the perpetra-
 tors to justice. The killers, however, have not yet been identified.
 Although the peacekeeping forces succeeded in separating the combatants, and
 the cease-fire has been essentially observed, isolated killings of both civilians and
 peacekeeping troops continue. Many Ossetian refugees returned to Tskhinvali from
 North Ossetia, but Georgian authorities say they cannot guarantee the safety of
 those who do. Some ethnic Georgians returning to their homes report receiving
 threats and many returnees have been reevacuated.
 The Georgian introduction of troops into Abkhazia in mid-Auust provoked an es-
 calation from political tensions to armed hostilities. Although the Georgian Govern-
 ment asserts that Abkhazian authorities approved Georgian troops moving into the
 region to protect transport lines from attacks by pro-Gamsakhurdia forces, Abkhaz
 guards fired on those troops when they entered Abkhazia. The subsequent move-
 ment of Georgian troops toward population centers ignited widespread fighting.
 Abkhazian separatist spokesmen subsequently asserted that the Georgians intended
 from the beginning to seize Abkhazia's main cities by force. For their part, the Geor-
 gians justified the military action on the grounds that Georgian officials kidnaped
 in Men rlia were being held in Abkhazia.
 Hostilities quickly widened, and accusations of excessive use of force and humani-
 tarian violations were exchanged. Most are difficult to confirm given ongoing hos-
 tilities, but there appear to be truth and exaggeration on both sides. Abkhazian ac-
 cusations of genocide, however, are clearly unfounded. Each side accused the other
 of holding civilians hostage in areas they controlled militarily. One Abkhazian, who
 stayed in Sukhumi for 2 months after the conflict began, charged that Georgian sol-
 diers entered her home and openly admitted they were robbing her family because
 of its ethnic identity. Georgians charge that the Abkhazians and North Caucasian
 (Russian Federation) guerrillas moved through captured towns with prepared lists
 of addresses of ethnic Georgians, plundered and burned homes, and executed des-
 ignated civilians. Sources with first-hand knowledge confirmed that some executions
 occurred. There were also rumors of atrocities committed by Abkhazians in the cap-
 tured city of Gagra, including the roundup and execution of civilians at the Gagra
 stadium; these executions have not been confirmed. Many now believe the incident
 was either greatly exaggerated or never took place. Georgian refugees from the area
 reported instances of rape and pillage.
 The Georgian Government has allowed the delivery of humanitarian supplies to
 the Abkhaz Population: Georgian authorities, however, say Abkhazians have in.
 
 
 779
 eved such deliveries to ethnic Georgians. The Abkhaziana claim that the Georgian
 vernment imposed an economic blockade on one city and that Georgian forces
 shelled Abkhaz villages near Georgian-controlled Ochamochire. The Georgians accuse
 the Abkhazians of reluctance to exchange prisoners of war and claim that Abkhaz
 forces shot one Georgian prisoner in the back while an exchange of prisoners was
 under way.
 A cease-rire agreement, including a somewhat ambiguous political settlement,
 signed on September 3 was never implemented. Each side assigns responsibility to
 the other, but the Abkhazians reportedly threatened to ignore the agreement from
 the start, while the Georgians asserted that observance of the agreement was com-
 pletely in their interest. Georgians also claim that the Abkhazians signed a cease-
 l:e and an agreement on the return to the status quoinGagra, with the joint sta.
 bilization committee implementing the September 3 accrd just hours before
 Abkhazian forces attacked and seized the city.
 The violent political upheavals affecting the central Government also claimed
 many victims in 1992. Estimates of the number of those killed in the December 22-
 January 6 overthrew of Gamsakhurdia range from over 100 to several hundred.
 Continuing  springtime  clashes in  Me     ia  between  Zviadit forces  and
 progovernment National Guard and paramilitary forces also claimed from 100 to
 more than 200 lives. Some noncombatants also perished in Mengrelia. It is convinc-
 ingly alleged that some of these victims were killed by progoverment forces who
 suspected them of involvement in the fighting.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Includ2ng
 a. Freedom of Speech and Iress.-Freedom of sp  eh was limited in 1992, particu-
 lary for supporters of the former presdent. The interim government ordered a ban
 on demonstrations during the first 6 mnths of the year, and political opponents
 generally had few opportunities to gain a hearing. Proovernment parasitary
 forces repeatedly harassed a prominent priest who served7 in Gamsmkhurdia's par-
 liament and who openly criticized the violent overthrow of the earlier government
 in his sermons and nonchurch contacts. Harassment included the spraying of the
 church residence with gunfire and the physical abuse and short-term detention of
 church workers (although the workers were immediately released after being hand-
 ed over to police).
 Freedom of the press was also limited in 1992. ProGamaskhurdia newspapers
 were shut down wen the Military Council took power in January. Some were later
 allowed to recommence operations. Authorities shut down one such paper, Iberia
 Spectre, and the Georgian-language paper Free Georgia again in June. The former
 was indirectly accused in a media campaign conducted by other newspapers of fo-
 menting the overthrow of the new Government. When the case came tortral in July
 the paper was charged only with failing to reregister a name change made several
 months earlier. It resumed publication after the court case but paramilitary groups
 repeatedly ransacked the papers offices, and the police claime  they were unable
 to identify the perpetrators. After one such incident, Shevardnadze openly criticized
 the harassment in the State Council; that night the paper was ransackta-a. Its
 editor, whose son died under mwsterious circumstances in January (see Section l.a.),
 claims that he was once told directly by a senior government official not to publish
 some of the articles scheduled for the next issue.
 Many journalists who worked in central television, radio, and the print media lost
 their jobs after Gamsakhurdia's overthrow. Zviadists further claimed that some
 journalists had been killed but were unable to substantiate their assertions. Jour-
 nalists employed on the sa-lofthe closed Free Georgia reported that they were fol-
 lowed and intimidated. One female journalist on the staff was briefly detained.
 The practice of self-censorshi is widespread in the Georgian media. While some
 papers published by the politic  parties criticized government policies, most papers
 avoided open opposition, particularly direct criticism of Shcvsrdnadze. The continu-
 ing crsis situation" was often cited as the primary cause for avoiding critical or
 self-perceived inflammatoryiarticles. Fear of retaliataon by paramilitary groups also
 played a role. Law enforcement organs, including the procu racy, and paramilitary
 rups which assumed a role in policing the media, broadly interpreted legal prohi-
 titions against material that allegedly incites the overthrow of the current Govern-
 ment. Those who attempted to persuade mainline newspapers to publish informa-
 tion on human rights violations met with little success.
 The broadcast media are affected by the same kinds of psychological and physical
 barriers as the print media, although there are occsional attempts to present oppo-
 sition viewpoints. A second television channel, nominally but not fully independent
 in practice, was established in Georgia in 1992. A former foreign minister under
 Gamsakhurdia, who joined the opposition during Gamsakhurdias administration
 
 
 780
 and remained in opposition to the current Government, appeared on television three
 times in the first half of 1992. After each appearance he was reportedly visited by
 representatives of the procuracy or the intelligence service who discussed seemingly
 unrelated issues. After his third appearance his attempts to air critical views on
 an editorial program were re  ate iy rebuffed. When the new television channel
 aired an interview in October with a Russian national active in dissident politics
 in Georgia, unidentified individuals fired shots at the channel's offices.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The right to peaceful assembly
 was strictly limited in 1992. Demonstrations were completely banned in Georgia
 until June, when the State Council passed a seemingly liberal law requiring the or-
 ganizer of a demonstration to notify city authorities 2 days in advance of the event.
 According to this law, the authorities have the right to determine only if the sug-
 gested location is acceptable but do not have the right to permit or deny the dem-
 onstration. The law notes, however, the criminal character of actions which might
 arouse national, ethnic, or religious hatred during a demonstration. The law also
 stipulates that participants in demonstrations or other political actions that violate
 the law must disperse at the request of the authorities. Despite the ban imposed
 by the Military Council, opposition groups held demonstrations throughout the
 spring. These demonstrations were routinely broken up by force, usually by a mix
 of law enforcement officials and nonuniformed armed personnel commonly thought
 to be Mkhedrioni members. They often fired shots to disperse demonstrators, some
 of whom were killed. The break-up of a February 2 demonstration in Tbilisi was
 particularly violent: Zviadists claim nine died. The total number of demonstration-
 related deaths is difficult to determine: official estimates range from two to six
 deaths; Zviadists claim "dozens." Authorities and paramilitary groups detained
 many participants for varying periods of time and in some cases beat them, either
 at the demonstration site or while in custody.
 Even after the law permitting demonstrations was passed, Zviadists refused to
 comply with its provisions requiring registration of demonstrations in advance. The
 authorities continued to disperse Zviadist demonstrations by force; in the latter half
 of 1992, however, no demonstration-related deaths were reported. A new opposition
 bloc formed in September reports it notified Tbilisi authorities, in accordance with
 legal requirements, of its intent to stage a demonstration in early October shortly
 before election day. The organizers called off the demonstration after finding the site
 occupied by a sizable armed police force supplemented by armored infantry carriers.
 Freedom of association was generally respected in 1992. Forty-seven parties and
 organizations registered before the October 11 elections. However, the Communist
 party is banned.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-Freedom of religion and of worship were widely exercised
 in 1992. The Gamsakhurdia-era emphasis on the primacy of the Georgian nation
 linked to the Georgian Orthodox faith, was abandoned by the present Government,
 although its effects linger. Some religious groups voiced minor complaints. Rep-
 resentatives of the Georgian Catholic Church complained that they are still trying
 to recover possession of churches given to the Georgian Orthodox Church during the
 Gamsakhurdia period and alleged that elements of Georgian Orthodoxy oppose the
 existence of the Catholic Church in Georgia. The Jewish community experienced no
 government interference in practicing its religion.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The old Soviet system of registering residency still exists, although its
 enforcement is uneven. Georgian officials accused the government of Abkhazia of
 abusing the system in favor of ethnic Abkhazians. Both foreign and internal travel,
 as well as emigration, are unrestricted, although there are practical problems in
 areas of conflict. The Georgian Government provided notable assistance in facilitat-
 ing the emigration of Jewish Georgians to Israel. Citizens generally enjoy the right
 to return, but there is continuing controversy over the desire of former primarily
 Muslim residents of the Meskheti region-de ported from Georgia in 1944 by Sta-
 lin-to return to that area. Over 200,000 Meshetians now living in central Asian
 republics and parts of Russia face significant popular opposition to their return, and
 the Government has been reluctant to take a formal position. Although the State
 Council established a committee to examine this issue, no conclusions were reached.
 In South Ossetia, Ossetian refugees began returning to Tskhinvali, but Georgian
 refugees remain afraid to return, and the authorities acknowledged that they are
 not yet able to guarantee their safety.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The violent political events of 1992 restricted Georgians' right and ability to
 oeacefullv change their government. Although the popularly elected Gamsakhurdia
 
 
 781
 government drew heavy international and domestic criticism for its abuses of power
 and human rights violations, its violent overthrow negated the freely expressed will
 of the electorate. The ensuing months of rule under a state of emergency and subse-
 ipently by a nonelected Presidium and State Council restricted free political choice.
 Those who supported the return of Gamsakhurdia to his post did not have a mean-
 ingful political voice.
 However, the October 11 parliamentary elections, despite shortcomings, were a
 step toward real participatory demo~zcp". Forty-seven parties and organizations reg-
 istered for and competed in the elections, with many combining into multiparty
 blocs. Campaigns were unrestricted. Parties/blocs received equal, free advertising
 time on television and radio. As a result of continuing armed conflict and dimin-
 ished central government control, elections were postpioned in 9 of 84 election dis-
 tricts located in Abkhazia, South Ossetia, and Mengreha.
 Although the elections were generally free and fair, as attested by international
 observers, there were minor but widespread technical violations and a few more se-
 rious ones: it apears, for example that officials of the Ajarian Autonomous Repub-
 lic, which is stl tightly run by a Soviet-style political machine, attempted to influ-
 ence the voting choices of their residents. Moreover, the abundant choice of parties
 and candidates did not equate to a fully mature development of the democratic proc-
 ess and the offering of clear political alternatives. While parties and blocs did de-
 velop, their platforms were vague.
 The election law was also modified several times before the final version, which
 established that there would also be a separate nationwide race for Chairman of the
 Parliament. Many politicians criticized the fact that candidates for this post were
 not permitted affiliation with any political party. Eduard Shevardnadze ran unop-
 posed, although the contest was open to other candidates, and won a resounding vic-
 tory.
 Minorities and women are less well represented in the new Parliament than they
 were in the Gamsakhurdia-era parliament or during Soviet rule. In part this ap-
 pears to be a reaction to the bitterly controversial Gamsakhurdia period. The cur-
 rent Government and its supporters are ill-disposed toward the participation of
 women in politics because they perceive that women were frequently the ex-presi-
 dent's most fervent supporters.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In.
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The All-Georgian Association for Human Rights, founded in 1990, currently has
 187 members. The-Association has not met with official resistance, although in one
 instance it was denied permission to visit a prisoner suspected of being tortured.
 A new Institute for Human Rights, an independent organization, was formed in Oc-
 tober. Its focus will be on nationalities and issues of pluralism.
 A government Commission on Interethnic Relations and Human Rights was
 formed soon after Shevardnadze's return but was not fully staffed until August. The
 Commission's ability to influence the behavior of the procuracy, National Guar
 and paramilitary groups is currently limited at best. Law enforcement agencies do
 not always respond with complete openness to its inquiries.
 The Government has welcomed the visits of international organizations. Several
 delegations from the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) vis-
 ited Georgia in 1992. In May a rapporteur mission visited Georgia to report on
 progress toward full implementation of CSCE commitments.
 United States CSCE Commission members visited Georgia several times and in-
 vestigated human rights practices without obstruction. Two CSCE missions came to
 investigate the possibility of CSCE assistance in achieving a peaceful resolution of
 the conflicts in South Ossetia and, later, in Abkhazia.
 The Government welcomed the establishment in October of a permanent United
 Nations presence in Georgia. There is a permanent International Committee of the
 Red Cross (ICRC) mission in, Georgia. Both sides have permitted ICRC members to
 travel freely throughout the conflict zone in Abkhazia. A Pax Christiani representa-
 tive also traveled unimpeded about the country to investigate minority and religious
 freedoms.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Language, or Social Status
 The Gamsakhurdia-era advocacy of the supremacy of the Georgian nationality,
 language, and Orthodox religion ceased with his departure from power. The feelings
 it aroused in the Georgian population, however, have lingered, sharpened by the
 poor economic situation. As a result, non-Georgians sometimes experience harass-
 ment from nonofficial Georgians, usually because of competition for scarce resources
 or opportunities. They suffer some job discrimination. Local police are sometimes in-

 different to requests for assistance from non-Georgians. Central authorities, when
 notified of complaints about such treatment, usually try, often with success, to rec-
 tify the situation.
 Georgians have become increasingly angered by what they term 'institutionalized
 discrimination" against them in Abkhazia. Of particular concern are electoral rules
 that apportion excessive representation in the regional parliament to ethnic
 Abkhazians, who constitute only 17.percent of the population.
 Educational and cultural autonomy has been accorded in Georgia. The Govern-
 ment provides funding for ethnic schools, and the teaching of non-Georgian lan-
 guages is freely permitted.
 Government concern about the status of and discrimination against women is
 minimal. That lack of concern is generally shared by society. There is no perceptible
 women's movement, nor are there academic programs in women's studies. There is
 a predominant stereotype held by the political elite (and shared by many women)
 that the majority of Gamsakhurdia's supporters are middle-aged, unmarried women,
 who are considered irrational fanatics. This image was in part shaped by television
 coverage of the more rabid pro-Gamsakhurdia demonstrations, particularly in west-
 ern Georgia, in which black-garbed, shrieking women were prominent participants.
 This attitude has discouraged women's involvement in Georgian politics.
 Women's access to educational resources is unimpeded, but women are found
 mostly in so-called traditional occupations. Their labor is usually low-paid and part-
 time. Statistics on violence against women are not available. According to sociolo-
 gists and legal specialists, however, incidents of rape and domestic violence are rare
 in Georgia.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-A mix of legislation survives from the Soviet era.
 The Labor Code provides that Georgian workers are permitted to form or join
 unions freely. Employees have the right to fo  associations, which may operate on
 the basis of their own charters. Unions and associations are not required to register
 with government bodies.
 The old centralized Soviet trade unions have essentially been disbanded, and a
 confederation of independent trade unions has emerged in their place. There are
 also some independent branch trade unions. Several branches of the old unions are
 competing for those unions' resources and property but have not been focusing on
 labor issues. Georgians now appear largely uninterested in unionization.
 Unions are not required to form a single central trade union federation, and
 unions may join federations and affiliate with international bodies if they choose.
 The few unions that are currently being formed are independent of government con-
 trol and receive no government funding. At present there are no restrictions on the
 conduct of political activities by unions.
 Under Georgia's previous parliament, Georgia acceded to the Universal Declara-
 tion of Human Rights and declared its superiority over local legislation. Therefore,
 unions may be said to have acquired the right to strike. There is no specific legisla-
 tion either permitting or preventing strikes. There were several strikes in 1992, but
 these were largely driven by political and not labor issues and were not organized
 by the unions.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The Labor Code provides that
 trade union representatives in all enterprises sign an annual contract stipulating,
 among other things, man'gement's obligations toward the workers and worker
 rights. Wages are still established primarily by the State. In the small but growing
 private sector, employees negotiate directly with employers on wages and working
 conditions. There is no legislation on antiunion discrimination.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced or compulsory labor is pro-
 hibited by laws dating back to the Soviet era and is not practiced.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-Basedon legislation from the So-
 viet era, the minimum age for children in the work force is 14 years, which appears
 to be widely respected. This legislation is enforced.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The Government adjusts the current minimum
 wage upward every month in an attempt to keep up with skyrocketing inflation. It
 is widely believed that the minimum wage is not sufficient to meet the basic needs
 of a Georgian family, although reliable statistics are not available.
 The standard legal workweek is 41 hours. The Government has not yet addressed
 the issue of occupational safety and health standards. Labor experts consider insuf-
 ficient the urovimons on health and safety remaininr from Soviet days.
