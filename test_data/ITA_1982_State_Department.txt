 ITALY
 Italy is a modern democratic state having a parliamentary
 system of government, with executive authority concentrated in
 the Cabinet of Ministers. Since 1947, the Government has
 consisted of Christian Democrats or, more often, of a coalition
 of parties which has included them as the dominant element.
 The President, indirectly elected, serves as Chief of State;
 the Prime Minister is head of Government. Italy has an
 industrialized market economy which ranks among the top ten in
 the world in GNP. The economy is characterized by sizeable
 government ownership of industry, particularly in the primary
 sectors, and by a dynamic private sector, especially at the
 level of medium and small companies. The Italian Constitution,
 a document drafted after World War II and influenced by
 Catholic social thought and social democratic theory, as well
 as by a desire to guard against a return to authoritarian rule,
 gives a prominent place to political and civil liberties.
 Despite continuing terrorist violence aimed at bringing about
 political and social disruption, political and civil liberties
 are fully respected by the State. These liberties are,
 however, violated frequently by terrorist organizations on both
 the left and the right. The past year has seen an increased
 effort by the Italian Government and its law enforcement
 agencies against the terrorist threat and against organized
 criminal elements such as the Mafia.
 While terrorism and organized crime have by no means been
 defeated in Italy, successes during the past year indicate that
 the problem is being more effectively dealt with. This may
 signficantly increase the security of human rights in Italy in
 the long run, although in the immediate future it could provoke
 further violations by both terrorist and criminal elements.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, including
 Freedom from:
 a. Killing
 There have been approximately 15 terrorist murders identified
 in the past year (as well as some 30 attempted assassinations
 and over 40 bombings). In general, the terrorist groups of the
 left justify their actions by claiming to oppose a "fascist" or
 "imperialist" state against which they are morally free to take
 violent measures. In doing so, they hope to provoke Italian
 law enforcement into over-reactions that will polarize the
 citizenry. Right-wing terrorists also hope to provoke a crisis
 that will eliminate the democratic system. Foreign terrorist
 organizations are also occasionally active in Italy. There are
 indications that various domestic terrorists have received some
 support from outside the country, most particularly from
 Palestinian extremist groups and Libya, and there have been
 allegations of direct or indirect Eastern European support.
 Organized criminal elements, mainly in Sicily and the South,
 have engaged in significant numbers of murders. In Sicily it
 is assumed that the great majority of almost 150 killings in
 Sicily (1982) are Mafia-related. Most noted were the
 assassination of prefect Dalla Chiesaand his wife and driver
 on September 3, 1982, and of the Sicilian Regional Secretary of
 the Italian Communist Party, Pio La Torre, on April 30, 1982.
 In the province of Naples there were over 200 murders in the
 first nine months of 1982, most attributed to organized crime.

 b. Disappearance
 There have been no cases of disappearance in Italy linked to or
 condoned by the State or its agents. People are, however,
 frequently seized in Italy by gangsters or by political
 terrorist groups. The most noted case was that of US Brigadier
 General Dozier who was held prisoner by the Red Brigades from
 December 17, 1981 until he was rescued on January 28, 1982. In
 Palermo province, over 100 people were estimated to have
 disappeared in 1982 as the result of Mafia activity.
 c. Torture
 Freedom from torture is guaranteed by law and is respected in
 practice. Occasionally people arrested on terrorist charges
 have accused government agents of torture. The most recent
 occasion coming to public attention was that involving several
 of the terrorists who had held US Brigadier General James
 Dozier prisoner. These charges of mistreatment are under
 investigation.
 d. Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 Cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment is
 forbidden by law and is not practiced. Conditions in places of
 detention vary but do not constitute a form of intentionally
 degrading treatment. Prisoners charged or convicted of
 terrorist acts are generally held separately from ordinary
 criminals. No invidious distinctions are made among prisoners
 on the basis of social class, race sex, or religion.
 e. Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 Police procedures in Italy are carefully circumscribed by law
 and,judicial oversight, and arbitrary arrest is not an Italian
 practice. While habeas corpus is not a provision of-Italian
 law, the rights of prisoners are protected by other law and
 procedural safeguards. Detention in Italy without charge
 cannot extend beyond 48 hours. Pre-trial detention after
 charges have been made varies according to the gravity of the
 crime; the maximum period is almost three years before the
 initial trial. (Detention through all possible appellate
 procedures in some cases could theoretically extend for as much
 as ten years before a final verdict.) At present the number of
 people being held awaiting trial is approximately 20,000, of
 whom 500 to 600 are being held on terrorist charges.
 f. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Counsel is mandatory and is provided free if necessary. Clear
 charges must be made by the magistrate within 48 hours of
 arrest. The judiciary is independent of the executive. There
 are no political or security courts, and civilians cannot be
 tried by courts martial unless martial law is declared. With
 the exception of courts martial decisions in time of war, all
 cases can be appealed to the Court of Cassazione (the highest
 court of appeal).
 g. Invasion of the Home
 Freedom from arbitrary invasion of the home is respected in
 practice. Warrants are required of officials to enter a
 private residence and are issued by the procuratore generale or
 the competent magistrate of the locality. The same authorities
 may also authorize electronic monitoring in certain limited
 instances. No illegal searches or other violations of the home
 are known to have occurred during the past year.

 2. Respect for Civil and Political Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Italian press exercises its constitutional guarantees of
 freedom and gives play to the full spectrum of political views,
 both governmental and opposition. Prior censorship or review
 of the press is forbidden by law. Publications may be seized
 for violations of the law against obscenity and defamation of
 state institutions or political or ecclesiastical leaders.
 This provision is interpreted narrowly, and it does not
 restrict to any meaningful degree the expression of political
 views or criticism.
 While government radio or television broadcasting networks
 exist, they too are open to a wide spectrum of views. In
 addition many private radio and television broadcasters compete
 vigorously, including on political topics. There is no
 governmental interference with academic inquiry.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The right of Italian citizens to assemble publicly may not be
 denied except for reasons of security or public safety and is
 respected in practice. The right of unions to organize,
 negotiate, and strike is fully protected as is the right of
 free association of Italian citizens in general. Unions are
 not under government control. Labor unions and professional
 associations freely and frequently exercise their rights of
 assembly and maintain relations with recognized international
 bodies in their fields. Unions claim that almost half of the
 workforce is unionized.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 The Constitution specifically provides that the State and the
 Catholic Church will each, in its proper sphere, be considered
 independent and sovereign, and that the relationship between
 them be governedrby the Lateran Treaties of 1929. Also all
 religious groups have the right to organize according to their
 own requirements, so long as these do not offend public order.
 Individuals have the right to profess any religious faith, to
 convert, to proselytize for that faith, and to exercise their
 religion in public or in private. Adherence to a particular
 faith does not confer special advantages or disadvantages.
 d. Freedom of Movement within the Country, Foreign Travel,
 Emigration, and Repatriation
 Italian citizens have the right to travel freely within the
 country, to go abroad, and to return. (An exception is applied
 to the former King of Italy, his wife, and male descendants,
 who are not allowed to enter Italian territory.) Deprivation
 of citizenship for political reasons is unconstitutional and is
 not practiced. There are no restrictions on emigration. Italy
 grants permanent residence to numerous political refugees. No
 instance is known in which political refugees have been forced
 to return to homelands from which they have fled.
 e. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Italy is ruled democratically by its citizens through their
 elected representatives. Citizens have a large choice of
 parties to support ranging from various Communist parties to
 right wing parties. (The Fascist party as such is outlawed by
 the Constitution.) Elections are free. Both chambers of
 
 
 "945
 parliament and regional and municipal councils are elected
 periodically. Opposition groups frequently manage to defeat
 government proposals. Women and minorities take an active part
 in the governing structure. There are some limited problems of
 nationality -- the most important being the continuing question
 of the rights of German-speaking population of South Tirol or
 Alto Adige.
 3. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigations of Alleged
 Violations of Human Rights
 The Italian Government has a good record in support of human
 rights throughout the world and participates fully in the
 appropriate international and regional human rights bodies.
 Human rights bodies are free to investigate and comment on
 conditions in Italy. In addition to political parties and
 religious groups, there is an active branch of Amnesty
 International. Amnesty has expressed concern that suspects
 have been held for judicial investigation for excessive
 periods. It also objects to the Italian practice of
 considering conscientious objectors to military service to be
 military personnel subject to military law. (The current
 Government has approved a bill which, if passed, would further
 relax the restrictions governing conscientious objectors.)
 Among the various organizations concerned with human rights in
 Italy are the Comitato Consultivo Italiano Per I Diritti Dell
 Uomo. the Instituto di Diritto Umanitario, and Caritas
 Internationalis. The Italian Government welcomes the interest
 of and cooperates with international and regional human rights
 bodies. Freedom House calls Italy "free".
 4. Economic, Social, and Cultural Situation
 The Government pays special attention to the South, where
 economic and social development has historically been slower
 than in northern Italy. While there are also ethnic and
 language groups which the Government recognizes as requiring
 extra assistance, economic and social services of the
 Government are available to all regardless of race6 religion,
 sex, ethnic background, or political opinion. As a country
 possessing an industrial market economy, Italy encourages the
 ownership of property alone as well as in association with
 others. Italy is a prosperous relatively developed country
 with a healthy population numbering 57,510,000 (1981). The
 growth rate in 1980 was 0.7 percent. Life expectancy at birth
 was 73.1 years and the infant mortality rate per 1,000 live
 births was 14.3 in 1981. The adult literacy rate was 98
 percent in 1976. Primary school enrollment ratio was 102
 percent (1979). The ratio of calorie supply available for
 consumption relative to nutritional requirements was 136
 percent (1977). The GNP per capita in 1980 was $6,487.10.
