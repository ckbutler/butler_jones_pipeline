 ST. VINCENT
 The nation of St. Vincent and the Grenadines gained
 full independence from the United Kingdom on October
 27, 1979, although the Queen of England remains the
 nominal Chief of State. St. Vincent had been ruled
 by Britian until 1967, when it was granted internal
 self-government as an associated state. Long years
 of experience with English common law has left a respect
 for the rights of the i ndividual and an open political
 system. The constitution provides for a parliamentary
 system of government and contains specific safeguards
 guaranteeing basic human rights.
 St. Vincent and the Grenadines had its first election
 as an independent nation shortly after independence.
 Four political parties of widely varied ideological
 views participated; the election was widely judged
 to be fair. On December 7, 1979, two days after the
 election, a secessionist uprising on Union Island
 in the Grenadines was successfully suppressed with
 assistance from neighboring Barbados. In the aftermath
 of the uprising, the government declared a state of
 emergency which lasted until May 15, 1980. During
 that period, a by-election was postponed and, at one
 time, up to 40 persons were charged and detained without
 bail. As soon as the emergency was lifted, the by-
 election was scheduled and all prisoners were released
 on bail except for four ringleaders later convicted
 in the normal criminal court.
 1.   Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 Article 5 of the constitution prohibits torture and
 it is not practiced.
 b.   Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 The constitution prohibits inhuman or degrading punish-
 ment, and it is honored in practice.
 c. Disappearances
 There is no indication that disappearances occur.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 The constitution makes provision for preventive detention
 under emergency laws and provides for legal representa-
 tion for the detainee and periodic review of his case.
 There are no political prisoners. During the early
 1980 state of emergency, prisoners detained in the
 Union Island insurrection were denied bail until the
 emergency was lifted, at which time they were released.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The constitution guarantees a fair hearing within
 a reasonable time by an independent and impartial
 court established by law. Access to legal counsel
 is also guaranteed and defendants are presumed to
 
 
 528
 be innocent until proven guilty. Decisions of local
 courts can be appealed to the West Indies Associated
 States Court of Appeals, which has a well-established
 reputation for impartiality, and, ultimately, to Her
 Majesty's Privy Council. There are no military courts.
 f. Invasion of the Home
 The constitution provides for protection from arbitrary
 search or entry and this is respected in practice.
 2.   Government Policies Relating to the Fulfillment
 of Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health
 Care and Education.
 St. Vincent and the Grenadines has a per capita gross
 domestic product estimated at $440. As this figure
 suggests, the nation has severe economic problems
 and also suffers from high unemployment, estimated
 to be 50 percent among male youth. Economic progress
 was set back in August 1980 by Hurricane Allen, which
 caused considerable infrastructure damage and devasted
 much of the agricultural economy-especially the banana
 crop, which was almost totally destroyed. Early indi-
 cations are, however, that the government is making
 every effort to overcome these problems as quickly
 as possible.      -
 While the base of the economy is agriculture, the
 government has been attempting to diversify into tourism-
 -already well-established in the Grenadines--and light
 industry. The government has outlined tax incentives
 and other encouragement to foreign private investment
 employing Vincentian labor. The small number of foreign
 investors in St. Vincent express satisfaction with
 the government's industrial program which has, however,
 made only small inroads so far in the substantial
 unemployment.
 There are no laws specifically guaranteeing womens'
 rights in the employment field. The Industrial Wages
 Act provides for a different--and lower--minimum wage
 for women than men engaged in factory work. There
 is also a provision prohibiting women from employment
 during midnight shifts-a regulation originally thought
 to benefit female workers.
 Although 1979-1980 figures are not yet available,
 1978 showed a 14.6 percent increase in real gross
 domestic product. The volcano and hurricane disasters
 will have sharply cut that rate in 1979-1980.
 The nation's poverty limits the resources it can expend
 on priorities such as social services. Good medical
 care is not available in much of the nation because
 of a paucity of doctors and their concentration in
 the capital. The government announced in 1980 its
 intention to establish a clinic in the heretofore
 medically unserviced Union Island in the Grenadines.
 Education and housing need substantial improvement,
 a fact which the government acknowledges.
 The government has a national provident fund, which
 provides for retirement benefits for much of the wage-
 earning population. Currently, a new national insurance
 scheme is planned, which will not, however, encompass
 
 
 529
 unemployment insurance. There are under present law
 no benefits for the jobless. There have been charges
 that the present government has neglected development
 and social services in the small Grenadine Islands.
 Such charges may stem from the consistent election
 of an anti-government member of parliament from the
 Grenadines.
 3.   Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a.   Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 The constitution guarantees these freedoms and they
 are respected in practice. There are five weekly
 newspapers in St. Vincent and the Grenadines represen-
 ting a wide range of opinion, and there is no censorship
 or government interference in their operations. Opposi-
 tion factions have accused the government of denying
 necessary police meeting permits for political reasons,
 especially during the state of emergency. There is
 no religious discrimination in St. Vincent and the
 Grenadines.
 The government has accepted the International Labor
 Organization's conventions of freedom of association.
 Unions enjoy the right of collective bargaining and
 are generally active on the industrial relations scene.
 There is no discrimination favoring one union or another.
 b.  -Freedom of Movement Within the Country,
 Foreign Travel, Emigration and Repatriation
 The constitution provides for a citizen's freedom
 of movement within the country as well as the right
 to enter and leave freely. The freedom is honored
 in practice. There are no refugee problems.
 c.   Freedom to Participate in the Political
 Process
 St. Vincent and the Grenadines enjoys universal suffrage,
 and there is active political participation in national
 elections every five years. Few organized groups
 pursue specific interests during inter-election periods.
 Rather, there are small political parties, that only
 appear to function actively during election time.
 On the other hand, the government tends to neglect
 popular consultation and opposition viewpoints in
 the assurance that it can pass its legislation without
 worrying about divergent viewpoints.
 Women have not taken a prominent part in the political
 process, and those who have done so have generally
 been wives of prominent politicians. No woman was
 elected to parliament at the most recent elections.
 4.   Government Attitudes and Record Regarding Interna-
 tional and Non-governmental-Investigation of
 Alleged Violations of Human Rights.
 As a new nation, St. Vincent and the Grenadines has
 not yet acceded, of its own accord, to any international
 human rights conventions. The government has announced
 its intention to review individually all treaties
 to which Great Britian acceded on its behalf. These
 include the New York Convention on the Political Rights
 of Women.

 There are no branches of international human rights
 organizations in St. Vincent, nor is there any local
 body publicly active in monitoring human rights viola-
 tions.
