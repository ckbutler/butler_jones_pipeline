 CONGO
 attempt by former army captain Pierre Anga and supporters with
 alleged ties to President Sassou's-predecessor, Joachim
 Yhombi-Opango. The Government officially acknowledged the
 arrest of four military men and-two civilians for alleged
 participation in the coup plot. Yhombi-Opango, Colonel Jean
 Michel Ebaka, and Lt. Colonel Eboundit, the ranking military
 officers arrested, remained in detention at a government
 housing-complex at the end of 1989. After one coup
 participant was tracked down and killed by government troops
 in July 1988, a number of his relatives and other associates
 were acrrested. The-Government claims to have released some of
 these persons. Ift November 1989, it announced the release of
 some- 40 civilians implicated in the 1987 coup attempt but has
 refubed to revea'l the names of those released or still in
 detedtion.
 In 1988 the President announced an amnesty for most persons
 held for political offenses since 1963, excepting those
 arrested in connection with the 1987 coup plot. Despite this
 announcement, it appeared that at least some other political
 detainees remained in prison at the end of the year.
 There were no known instances of exile being used as a means
 of political control in 1989. With regard to forced or
 compulsory labor,,see Section 6.c.
 e-., Dbbial of a Fair Public Trial
 The legal system is not free'from political interference. The
 Constitution establishes the Supreme Court at the apex of the
 judiciary, but in practice this Court is an arm of the
 executve branch rather than an independent body. The amended
 Constitution also provides for honprbfessional judges to be
 elected to all courts below the-Supreme Court.' The stated
 purpose of this was to "popularize justice," i.e., brovide a
 role for peers to influence the formal judicial process.
 According to the law, any Congolese citizen can become a judge
 but can adjudicate cases only in collaboration with trained
 judges. All nominations must be approved by the party.  By
 law, the right to a fair and public trial exists'in all cases,
 and the judicial process is relatively fair and open for those
 accused of c6mmon crimes. It is not unusual to have a higher
 court reverse lower court decisions in nonpolitical cases.
 Detained persons are entitled to legal counsel, and all
 lawyers are regulated by the State. In capital criminal
 cases, defense lawyers are provided by the Government for
 those without funds.
 While political cases usually do not come to the trial stage,
 when they do they are tried by a-special court, the
 Revolbtionary Court of Justice. Trials before this Court,
 such as the August 1986 trial of 10 persons convicted of
 causing bomb explosions in Btazzaville in 1982, have not met
 internbtional standards of fairnesg. In that case, AI
 indicated that several judges were members of the PCT Central
 Committee and had been involved in the case at an earlier
 stage. In 1988 the President commuted the sentences of four
 defendants in the case. There were no known political cases
 tried before the Revolutionary Court in 1989.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy,-Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 There is generally litltle interference by the Government with
 privacy, family, home, or correspondence so long as a person
 
 
 86
 does not engage in any overt activity which involves or
 implies opposition to the Government.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Freedom of speech and press are restricted, despite guarantees
 ,in the Constitution. The Government allows some criticism of
 its policies and programs judged not to be politically
 sensitive, but it does not allow its ultimate authority to be
 challenged publicly. The Government'does not hesitate to
 arrest people and hold them incommunicado for expressing views
 it finds objectionable, as in the cases of the "new society"
 writers (see Section l.d) and Jean-Felix Demba Ntelo, who was
 released by presidential decree in 1988 after several months
 in custody. (The Government maintains that these persons were
 involved in a coup plot.)
 The State owns and controls all media except for one weekly
 religious newspaper. A state censorship committee reviews the
 content of all newspapers, movies, books, and records.
 Articles considered to be critical-of the Government or its
 leaders are'censored. The Government and party, through
 general guidelines for journalists, control the kind of news
 Congolese journalists may publish from various sources of
 information. Self-censorship, however, is the general pattern.
 The Congelese have access to Zairian radio and television, as
 -well as-to news and feature programming from France and the
 United States. Vestern.papers and magazines are freely
 ,available. However, individual issues containing articles
 -critical of Congolese domestic politics have been pulled from
 newsstands and the mails; and foreign journalists working on
 domestic issues are occasionally detained or expelled.
 Foreign-journalists are generally permitted to travel freely
 once an entry visa and a special permit for travel to the
 interior are obtained. These are usually granted.
 Academic freedom is limited. The Congolese educational system
 borrows liberally from the Soviet system in form, but it
 offers a broad range of materials, including American, to
 students. Increasing numbers of Congolese pursue higher
 education in American and other Western institutions.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The right of peaceful assembly is limited by the State's
 perceived-self-interest. Political meetings are permitted
 only for the party and its affiliated organizations.
 Government permission is not required for groups to assemble
 for .religious or social purposes, but it is required for the
 use of official facilities. Government authorization is also
 required to establish professional clubs and organizations, of
 which there are several.
 For a discussion of freedom of association as it applies to
 labor unions, see section 6.a.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Freedom of religion is guaranteed by law, but the Government
 is officially atheist. Christmas Day, for example, is
 officially called Children's Day. Religious organizations,
 such as the Salvation Army, must obtain government permission
 
 
 87
 CONGO
 to work in the Congo. Jehovah's Witnesses are not permitted.
 Members of the Baha'i faith may hold services but are
 prohibited from organizing and teaching. With these important
 exceptions,.the government and party position toward religious
 affairs is characterized by political pragmatism, with
 regular, though unofficial, contacts between the respective
 leaderships.
 The Catholic Church, the largest single religious community,
 maintains a seminary for the training of its clergy and has
 missions throughout the country. Masses are held in French
 and the various local languages, The Catholic church
 publishes the only independent newspaper, La Semaine
 Africaine. Catholic and other missionaries are active in
 managing.private missions and providing other social
 services. Some social services formerly provided by the
 Catholic Church have lapsed, but a few continue as joint
 church-government ventures, especially in education. With the
 .recent liberalization in Congo's economic policies, there are
 some signs of government efforts to solicit church support,
 including the provision of seats for religious representatives
 in the National Assembly.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 The Government exercises limited control over the internal
 movement of its -citizens through identification card checks
 and-contxol.points-outside all major towns where soldiers or
 -midlitiarigoxopsly check identification documents. Congolese
 citizens-wishing- to travel abroad require exit authorization
 from the State-Security Organization (DGSE). Passports are
 generally granted but must be returned to the DGSE after the
 traveler returns-from abroad. There are no known instances of
 Congolese being refused the, right to return to their country.
 There are no known cases of a native-born Congolese being
 denied citizenship.
 The Congo is the home of about 2,000 refugees, primarily from
 Chad, Central African Republic, Rwanda, Burundi, and Zaire.
 In the case of Zaire, refugees are often indistinguishable
 from.the sizable number of Zairians in.Congo engaged in
 economic pursuits. Refugees are subject to surveillance,.and
 occasional harassment and-expulsion by the Congolese
 Government, but there has been no widespread or systematic
 forced repatriationof refugees. The Congo is a party to the
 U.N. Convention and Protocol Relating to the Status of
 Refugees, and a representative of the United Nations High
 Commissioner for Refugees is resident in Brazzaville.
 Section I Respect for Political Rights: -The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 The Congolese people do not have the right to change their
 government through democratic processes. Under the
 Constitition, .the President of the Central Committee of the
 Congolese Labor Party (PCT) is automatically President of the
 Republic. After coming.to power in-.a surprise Central
 Committee maneuver in 1979, Colonel Denis Sassou-Nguesso was
 reelected by regular party congresses in 19-4 and 1989. The
 President is the most powerful single person in government,
 but his authority is limited by his need to maintain a
 consensus in the Political Bureau and within the larger
 Central Committee. The Congolese military, whose leadership
 is drawn primarily from the north, supports the Government,
 
 
 88
 and its officers occupy key positions among the ruling group.
 Government and party positions, however, are awarded to
 representatives of the southern and eastern ethnic groups in
 numbers sufficient to ensure their support or acquiescence and
 to maintain a rough regional and ethnic political balance.
 Opportunities for political involvement by Congolese citizens
 are limited to the Marxist-Leninist Congolese Labor Party
 (PCT), including its mass organizations, and to participation
 in national, regional, and local assemblies. The PCT is the
 "supreme social and political organization." No other
 political parties are permitted to operate, and political
 competition takes place almost exclusively within the PCT
 framework. PCT membership is approximately 10,000 out of a
 population of some 2 million. Membership is awarded on the
 basis of political loyalty and public service.
 The national, regional, and local assemblies are elected by
 universal suffrage from single, party-approved lists, which
 contain only one candidate for each seat. The selection
 process can involve a certain amount of negotiation within the
 PCT, and incumbents have been turned out of office in the
 process. National Assembly representatives are chosen on a
 merit basis from a broad spectrum of the population, including
 party members, the army, small farmers, workers, and
 representatives of religious groups. The powers of the
 National Assembly are limited, but its debates on social and
 economic issues have some impact. Regional and local
 assemblies may discuss issues and make recommendations before
 decisions are made at the national level. The last elections
 for the national, regional, and local assemblies took place in
 September 1989.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Congo Government rarely publicizes the arrest, trial, or
 release of political opponents. Polite listening without
 response is standard government procedure when faced with
 human rights inquiries from foreign governments or
 nongovernmental organizations. Foreign journalists have been
 expelled for investigating human rights issues, such as the
 circumstances under which political detainees are held. The
 Government did permit AI to send an observer to the 1986
 bombing trial. It did not respond, however, to AI's
 subsequent request to send a delegation to review the human
 rights situation or to its 1987 memorandum concerning the 1986
 trial. There are no human rights organizations in the Congo.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Under the Constitution there is no official discrimination
 based on race, sex, religion, language, or social status. As
 previously noted, northerners, especially those of the Cuvette
 region, exert strong influence in politics and in the security
 services. There are occasional reports of mistreatment of
 pygmies. Such incidents seem to be the result of cultural
 friction between those forest dwellers and villagers, rather
 than government policy, which specifically calls for
 integrating the pygmies into the economy and society.
 Women have the same legal rights .as men in commerce, politics,
 and society. Among some ethnic groups, women are often the
 
 
 89
 CONGO
 chief decisionmakers. There is a large disparity, however,
 inbetween'salaries for men and women, and women are relegated to
 --a secondary role in the modern sectors of society. This also
 holds for rural society where women are heavily involved in
 traditional family farming. The husband has considerable
 legal.or actual control over the activities of his spouse, a
 control usually moderated by the influence of the extended
 family. CQngolese women may not receive official travel
 documents without the permission of their husband, father, or
 male head of family.
 Anecdotal evidence suggests violence against women, for
 example in the form of wife beating, is not widespread in the
 . Congo. However, there are no studies or statistics available
 -to A~termine more precisely the extent of the problem. There
 are-no specific laws addressing violence against women beyond
 those protecting individuals regardless of sex. Legal
 remedies through the court system are available but are rarely
 used. In this strongly family-oriented society, informal
 remedies through the extended family system are most readily
 used. The Government has not specifically addressed the issue
 of violence against women, but in any case relies on the PCT
 women's organization to take the leadership role in educating
 the public in such matters. Female genital mutilation
 (circumcision) is not practiced among the Congolese; it may,
 however, occasionally be found among West Africans resident in
 Brazzaville or Pointe Noire.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 The labor code adopted in March 1975 provides in theory for
 the right or workers to associate. In practice, given its
 historically active political role, the labor movement is
 scrutinized closely and controlled by the Government and
 party, largely through the umbrella union, the Congolese Trade
 Union Confederation (CSC), which is itself an appendage of the
 party. No group is allowed to form an independent,
 alternative union outside the party. As long as political
 subjects are avoided, there is a degree of democratic dialog
 within the labor movement and between the CSC and the
 Government.
 The CSC unions are prohibited from striking, although wildcat
 strikes occur with relative impunity.
 The CSC is affiliated with the Communist-controlled World
 Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU), but it is free to and does
 associate with other international and regional labor
 organizations. As a reflection of the Government's efforts to
 improve contacts with Western countries, the CSC leadership in
 1988 proposed establishment of a bilateral relationship with
 the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial
 Organization's (AFL/CIO) African American Labor Center
 (AALC)." However, the AFL/CIO's policy against association
 with WFTU-affiliated unions has limited the contacts and
 prevented Congolese participation in AALC-sponsored activities.
 Despite government assertions that the single trade union
 system results from the common will of the workers and from
 political, economic, and historical development, the
 International Labor Organization's (ILO) Committee of Experts
 again in 1989 noted that a trade union monopoly established by
 legislation is in violation of ILO Convention 87 on Freedom of
 
 
 90
 CONGO
 Association, which the Congo has ratified, and has urged the
 Government to bring its legislation into conformity.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 The CSC is represented in every ministry and state-owned
 enterprise and serves on management boards along with a member
 of the Government and the party. Known as the "determinant
 trilogy," this structure is responsible for ensuring that the
 three major points of view are represented in the
 decisionmaking process and serves as Congo's form of
 collective bargaining in both the public and private sectors.
 While no alternatives to strikes exist, the local unions
 within the CSC have been able, in some instances, to persuade
 the Government to provide workers with increased benefits,
 including wage increases. The entire Congolese labor force is
 treated equally under the law; there are no exceptions such as
 those granted, for example, to export processing zones, of
 which the Congo has none.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 There were no reports of forced or compulsory labor, which is
 legally prohibited.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 The minimum age for employment of children is 16. Outside the
 Government and major employers, this minimum is often ignored,
 especially in small family enterprises or family farms in the
 subsistence agricultural sector.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 Working conditions for the 50 percent of the population in the
 modern sector are generally good and include a social security
 system. These conditions include a maximum 40-hour workweek,
 at least 1 day of rest per week, family benefits, severance
 pay, and medical care. The minimum monthly wage is $85 for
 urban employees. Domestic workers must be paid at least $75
 monthly. Outside the Government, large corporations, and
 foreign enterprises, these minimums are often ignored. While
 many salaried Congolese have a rather high standard of working
 conditions and social benefits, the minimum wage does not
 provide a decent standard of living for a worker and his
 family. Workers at this wage level and many others in the
 informal sector are dependent upon the extended family,
 including other salaried family members, and some subsistence
 farming, in which most of the rural population is still
 engaged. There is a code of occupational safety and health,
 although it, too, is not rigidly enforced.
