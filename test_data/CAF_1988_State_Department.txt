 CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC
 The Central African Republic (C.A.R.) is a one-party state in
 which General Andre Dieudonne Kolingba has held virtually all
 political power since his accession to power in a bloodless
 coup on September 1, 1981. In 1986 President Kolingba
 established the only legal political party, the Central
 African Democratic Assembly (RDC). Later that year he
 introduced a new Constitution, which was subsequently approved
 in a national referendum. In that same vote he was elected to
 a 6-year term as President. The new Constitution called for
 direct election of a National Assembly and the creation of an
 advisory body known as the Economic and Regional Council.
 Assembly members were elected in July 1987 and held their
 first session later that year.
 The Ministry of Defense controls a military police force
 (Gendarmerie Nationale), in addition to the armed forces,
 which number about 3,800 soldiers. These forces share
 internal security responsibilities with the civilian police
 force (Police Nationale) under the Ministry of Interior, which
 is responsible for manning barriers on the major roads and
 keeping records of the movement of vehicles. The Presidency
 has its own security force, which has collateral
 responsibility with the border police for airport security.
 The C.A.R. is a poor, landlocked, and sparsely populated
 country, most of whose inhabitants derive their livelihood
 from subsistence agriculture. The essentially unregulated
 agrarian economy, one of the world's least monetized, has
 suffered in the past from ineffective government fiscal and
 developmental policies and a poorly trained work force. Since
 1982 the Government has tried to implement economic structural
 reforms in cooperation with international donors; but, against
 a background of unfavorable global economic trends, progress
 has remained elusive.
 While human rights, especially political rights, are tightly
 restricted, there were some positive developments in 1988.
 The National Assembly held its first working sessions, marked
 by vigorous debates on government policies, such as the
 economic reform program. Among the laws passed was a measure
 providing workers the right to organize and form unions,
 although by year's end labor elements had yet to take
 advantage of it. Nationwide municipal elections brought a
 measure of self-determination to the management of local
 government. A presidential clemency decree reducing the death
 sentence of former emperor Jean-Bedel Bokassa to a life
 sentence at hard labor closed a turbulent chapter in the
 country's history.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There have been no reports of killings or executions for
 political motives by government forces. In previous years,
 there were sporadic challenges from dissidents in the
 northwest of the country. In 1988 some opposition groups
 which operated in that area took advantage of a government
 amnesty program to lay down their arms. However, highway
 robbers, both Central African and foreign, continue to keep
 the subprefectures of Bocaranga and Paoua unsettled.

 CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reports of politically motivated disappearance.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 The penal code prohibits torture and provides for sanctions
 against those found guilty of physical abuse. There have been
 no reported incidents of physical abuse in the past 5 years.
 Family members, legal counsel, doctors, and clergy generally
 have access to prisoners, .including prominent political
 detainees. The latter frequently receive special privileges,
 including permission to leave the prison periodically.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Under Central African law, political detainees may be held
 without charge for as long as 2 months, but must then be
 formally charged or released. Common criminals must be
 brought within 96 hours before a magistrate, who decides
 whether formal charges will be filed. In practice, this limit
 is sometimes exceeded owing to inefficiencies in the system.
 No system of bail exists. When political detainees are
 charged, local-judicial procedures (which are modeled on the
 French system) allow for open-ended preventive detention while
 the public prosecutor prepares the State's case against the
 accused.
 In the past the Government has detained suspected opponents
 without charge or trial. In March 1988. the Government
 detained several students who allegedly instigated university
 strikes and demonstrations protesting government cuts in
 students' financial aid. Such demonstrations were declared
 illegal in March 1986. Five student leaders involved in the
 March 1988 strike were detained for 3 months without charges
 before being released. Three others were charged with
 disturbing the peace but were released in November 1988.
 The exact number of politicai opponents in exile is unknown.
 Up to four former leaders of opposition groups reportedly fear
 imprisonment if they return. The Government has made it known
 that former opponents who write and request a pardon may, at
 the discretion of the President, be allowed to return. There
 are also a few former students who fled the country in early
 1980's, after being censured for involvement in student
 strikes still living abroad. It is believed that they could
 return without fear of imprisonment.
 With regard to forced or compulsory labor, see Section 6.c.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 In most cases involving common criminals, the Government
 permits French-modeled legal procedures to be fairly and
 openly applied and the laws to be properly executed. The
 Constitution provides that the judiciary "is guaranteed
 independence (from) the legislative and executive (power)."
 However, the President is the guarantor of that independence,
 notably in his role as President of the Supreme Magistrative
 Council.
 In early 1988, a new High Court of Justice was created to try
 political prisoners. It replaced a special tribunal made up
 
 
 60
 CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC
 of civilian magistrates and military advisers which had
 adjudicated political cases. It will function in much the
 same manner as the ordinary courts, where detainees have a
 right to legal counsel at all stages in the formal
 procedures. There is no right to appeal, although the
 possibility of presidential clemency exists. The High Court
 of Justice is expected to sit for the first time in January
 1989.
 Former emperor Jean-Bedel Bokassa was tried in the Bangui
 Criminal Court and sentenced to death in August 1987 after
 being found guilty of 4 out of the 14 charges against him.
 After reviewing the trial for technical error, the Supreme
 Court upheld the decision, but in February 1988 President
 Kolingba commuted the sentence to life imprisonment at hard
 labor. The number of political prisoners is unknown.
 However, in 1988 there were several people serving jail
 sentences who had been convicted in previous years of writing
 seditious literature.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 With the significant exception of political and security
 matters, the Government does not normally interfere in the
 private lives of citizens. The law formally prohibits the
 invasion of the home without a warrant, and this prohibition
 is not generally abused in civil and criminal cases. If a
 political crime is considered to be involved, police are
 allowed to search private property without written
 authorization. To combat increasing local crime, including
 robbery and assault, citizens' action groups, called vigilance
 committees, were created by the RDC. These committees consist
 of 20 young men per neighborhood who have volunteered their
 services to patrol the streets. They have the right to stop
 suspected criminals and either take them directly to the
 police or hold them overnight. In August the RDC instituted a
 code of conduct to guide committee members, e.g., it forbids
 them from invading private property or acting in the capacity
 of a police officer.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The right of private citizens to speak publicly about
 political developments or to criticize the Government is
 circumscribed, although most people feel free to comment
 privately on political affairs. The National Assembly, which
 held its first session in October 1987, provides a limited
 forum for public discussion of government policies (see
 Section 3).
 Newspapers, radio, and television are all controlled by the
 Government, which is careful to ensure that its point of view
 is reported. The sole regular newspaper is published by the
 Presidency. A second paper, le Petit Observateur, started
 publishing bimonthly issues in early 1988, but the Government
 subsequently banned its production, claiming it had been
 published illegally.
 Other papers appear on a sporadic basis but are closely
 monitored by the Government, and the distribution of tracts
 and literature deemed by it to be subversive is prohibited. A
 government journalist, Thomas Kwazo, who filed a 1986
 
 
 61
 CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC
 wire-service story on an alleged meeting between President
 Kolingba and ex-emperor Bokassa without clearance from his
 supervisor, was tried and sentenced to 3 years in prison.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Despite constitutional guarantees of the right to assembly,
 only assemblies of a nonpolitical nature can take place
 without government approval. Groups that register with the
 Ministry of Interior can hold meetings. Government forces
 quickly disband unlawful assemblies and, in some instances,
 arrest the participants.
 Student demonstrations during the 1986-87 school year were met
 by police dressed in riot gear, .and one student was injured by
 a hurled tear gas canister. Student demonstrations and
 strikes have been banned since 1986. A student association
 was reestablished in 1987 but was officially disbanded
 following the December 1987 student strikes.
 For a discussion of freedom of association as it applies to
 labor unions, see Section 6.a.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 The Government generally does not interfere with religious
 activities as long as they remain strictly nonpolitical in
 nature. Religious organizations and missionary groups are
 provided religious freedom by Central African custom. No
 single religion predominates, nor does the Government appear
 to discriminate in favor of or against specific religions.
 Any group whose behavior is considered political in nature is
 quickly stifled. In 1986 most foreign missionaries belonging
 to the Jehovah's Witnesses left the country after the
 Government formally prohibited their activities. Native-born
 adherents to the sect continue to meet and worship and have
 not experienced official interference since that time.
 d. Freedom of Movement .within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 People are generally free to move about within the country,
 although there are road checkpoints. The right of voluntary
 travel and repatriation is recognized. Financial and
 education constraints, rather than government controls, act to
 restrict most foreign travel and emigration. There were no
 known cases of revocation of citizenship.
 A reduction of political tensions in Chad since 1985 prompted
 many Chadian refugees in the C.A.R. to return to their
 homeland voluntarily. Their number in the C.A.R. declined to
 a few hundred in 1988, from a previous high of 45,000 in
 "1984-85.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Despite a Constitution which grants citizens the implicit
 right to change their government, they axe unable to exercise
 this right through democratic procedures. Since 1984 Kolingba
 has progressively reduced the military presence in government
 in favor of a larger civilian presence. -Although in practice
 he allows his Cabinet considerable leeway in the day-to-day
 activities of -government administration, Kolingba makes all
 important policy decisions.

 CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC
 Within the context of a one-party state under a strong,
 authoritarian executive, the Central African Republic has
 taken steps toward expanding participation in the political
 process. For example, in 1987 nationwide elections were held
 for the 52 seats in the National Assembly. (There are 3
 deputies representing each prefecture, and 4 representing
 Bangui; all serve a 5-year term.) Multiple candidates
 campaigned vigorously, and the secret ballot elections were
 widely viewed as free and fair. While candidates were vetted
 in advance by the RDC, party membership was not required.
 The Constitution grants the Assembly the authority to debate
 and vote on legislation brought before it by the executive
 and, with the concurrence of one-third of the deputies, to
 initiate legislation of its own. Deputies are promised
 immunity from prosecution or other government interference for
 opinions voiced or votes cast during the exercise of their
 duties in the National Assembly. The first two working
 sessions of the Assembly in 1988 were characterized by
 spirited debate and occasional sharp criticism of the
 Government's proposals. But, in the end, nearly all measures
 introduced by the executive were adopted with nearly unanimous
 votes and with few significant amendments.
 Elections for municipal councillors were held in May 1988. In
 the seven largest towns, the Ministry of the Interior chose
 one member of the elected municipal council to serve as
 mayor. In the smaller municipalities, the newly elected
 councillors elected their own mayors, although the central
 Government appears to have exercised considerable influence
 over the ultimate choice.
 In 1988 women began to play a more visible role in
 Government. The national women's organization was made an
 official arm of the national party, and the President
 appointed the organization's president to the position of
 Secretary of State for Social Affairs, making her the highest
 ranking woman in the Government. The national women's
 organization was instrumental in getting a number of women
 elected as municipal councillors, but the National Assembly
 remains an exclusively male preserve. Two of the nation's
 magistrates are women.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 In 1988 the Government showed increased sensitivity to human
 rights issues. It responded in detail to questions raised by
 the U.N. Human Rights Committee, which monitors compliance
 with the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights,
 at its March session and by the International Labor
 Organization (ILO) conference in June. The Government
 provided detailed written observations, including counter
 arguments, to allegations in the U.S. Country Report on Human
 Rights Practices in the C.A.R. published in February 1988.
 Representatives of Amnesty International and the International
 Committee of the Red Cross visit Bangui periodically.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Although there are more than 80 ethnic groups in the Central
 African Republic, each with its own language, the Sangho
 language is spoken throughout the country. About 70 percent
 
 
 63
 CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC
 of the population is Ngbaka, Baya, or Banda. While President
 Kolingba has made statements about the desirability of an
 ethnic balance in his Cabinet, preference for high government
 and military positions has been given to members of his Yakoma
 ethnic group (approximately 10 percent of the population).
 The Constitution mandates that all persons are equal before
 the law without regard to race, ethnic origin, sex, or
 religion. Polygamy is legally sanctioned, but the prospective
 husband must indicate at the time of the marriage contract
 whether he intends to take further wives. Divorce is legal in
 the C.A.R. and may be initiated by either partner. Children
 have the right to support from the father until they reach the
 age of majority. Although the Constitution forbids
 discrimination based on the sex of the individual, women have
 traditionally been accorded fewer opportunities than men. In
 1985 and 1986, for example, only 39 percent of primary school
 students and 26 percent of secondary students enrolled were
 female, according to Ministry of Education statistics.
 Certain jobs also remain closed to women, such as service in
 the Gendarmerie. There are no precise data on the percentage
 of women in the paid labor force. Many are involved in the
 marginal labor force--gathering food and firewood and keeping
 house while others are in commerce as market vendors. While
 educated women typically find jobs as secretaries, a few are
 moving into career paths as doctors, teachers, health care
 workers, economists, financial advisors, and managers.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 A 7-year suspension of most trade union activity ended on May
 19, 1988, when a law concerning trade union freedom and the
 protection of union rights was adopted. The new law
 guarantees employees and employers the right to establish and
 join organizations of their own choosing; to draw up their own
 constitution and rules, to elect their own representatives;
 and to formulate their program of action. By year's end, the
 right of association existed only on paper, since worker
 groups had not yet organized themselves. The two seats on the
 Economic and Regional Council reserved for workers remained
 unfilled for the same reason, according to the Government.
 Worker groups claim they cannot organize until the RDC issues
 implementing regulations for the labor unions.
 The 1988 union law neither forbids nor approves labor strikes,
 but there have been none in recent years.
 The number of workers affected by trade union legislation is
 small, as only about 10 percent of the work force consists of
 salaried employees and wage earners. The 1988 ILO Committee
 on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations
 questioned whether the May 1988 law on trade unions fully
 conforms to ILO Convention No. 87 on freedom of association.
 At issue was Article 4 of the law, which states that trade
 unions may affiliate themselves into a single national
 confederation. Some committee members maintained that this
 stipulation improperly restricts the right of unions to
 affiliate with other unions, and therefore constitutes a
 violation of Convention No. 87. Local labor leaders have in
 addition criticized the law for a provision in Article 1 that
 permits individuals to belong to a union only as long as they
 are paid employees or employers.
 
 
 64
 CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC
 The new labor law of May 1988 does not address the issue of
 whether trade unions may join international organizations, but
 the 1961 labor code permits this.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 The 1988 union law, which applies throughout the country,
 accords trade unions full legal status, including the right to
 own property and to sue in court. Employers are forbidden
 from discriminating against workers on the basis of union
 membership or union activity, and infractions can result in
 the assessment of legal damages. It is too early to tell
 whether, or how effectively, these provisions will be
 enforced. Mechanisms for collective bargaining fell into
 disuse during the 7-year ban on union activity, and had not
 yet been revived in late 1988. The new law does not
 specifically address whether trade unions may engage in
 collective bargaining.
 As recently as February, there were occasional reports of
 government interference with labor leaders. Two prominent
 figures in the local labor movement were questioned by the
 authorities following their November 1987 meeting with a
 visiting African American Labor Center representative. One of
 these men has claimed that he was briefly detained in February
 by a community vigilance committee of the RDC because of his
 union activism, and that on another occasion his house was
 searched and papers confiscated. Labor legislation is applied
 uniformly throughout the country.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 The ILO Committee in the past noted "considerable
 divergencies" between Conventions No. 29 and 105 on forced
 labor azd legislation and practice in the C.A.R. After the
 Government presented its case in mid-1988, the Committee
 concluded that "considerable difficulties still remained."
 The ILO pressed for a contacts mission to investigate these
 and other allegations of worker rights abuses. The Government
 agreed in principle and projected a contacts mission visit in
 1989.
 The controversy surrounding the issue of forced labor centers
 around several laws dating back to the 1960's. One purports
 to eliminate idleness; another requires rural farmers to
 maintain specified areas under cultivation; a third law
 specifies hard labor as a punishment for unauthorized
 political activity outside the then national party, the
 Mo, ement for Social Evolution in Black Africa (MESAN). The
 Government stated that the provisions against idleness are
 obsolete, are not enforced, and would be formally abrogated by
 Parliament in the near future. It maintained that the law
 concerning rural cultivation never introduced forced labor,
 but was designed to provide farmers with technical support
 services to help them increase production. As for the law on
 political activity outside of MESAN, the Government responded
 that MESAN was dissolved in 1979 and that the law was
 therefore obsolete.
 There exists a local penal practice, termed "corvee," which
 sentences men without identification papers to a day or two of
 labor--usually clearing roadside weeds. But this practice has
 not been cited by the ILO as a violation of forced labor
 conventions.
 
 
 CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 Employment of children under 14 years of age is forbidden by
 law. The relevant legislation is only loosely enforced. Jobs
 are in such demand that children in the labor force are
 generally limited to wozking as helpers in family businesses,
 such as agriculture, and in towns, selling food products or
 cigarettes.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 Minimum wages are established by the Government, and a social
 security system exists for private industry. The minimum wage
 for a manual laborer, for example, is about $40 per month, and
 about $140 per month for a stenotypist. These amounts are
 barely adequate to maintain a decent standard of living. The
 Government has not raised the minimum wage since 1980, partly
 in xesponse to pressure from foreign donors. Much labor is
 performed outside the wage and social security system,
 especially in the large subsistence agricultural sector by
 self-employed farmers. The law sets maximum working hours for
 government employees and most people in .the private sector at
 40 hours per week. Domestic employees may work up to 55
 hours. There are also general .laws on health and safety
 standards in the workplace, but they are neither precisely
 defined nor actively enforced.
