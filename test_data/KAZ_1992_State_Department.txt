 KAZAKHSTAN
 Kazakhstan declared its independence in December 1991, the last non-Russian re-
 public to do so following the dissolution of the Soviet Union. Nursultan Nazarbayev
 
 
 won the independent Republic's first presidential election the same month. He held
 the same position under Soviet rule and ran unopposed in the election. He is the
 dominant political figure as the country attempts to move to democracy and a free
 market. The Supreme Soviet, which remains the legislative branch, predates inde-
 pendence. Its members, elected in March 1990 under the old Soviet system, do not
 enjoy a democratic mandate and are only a modest check on presidential power. The
 Supreme Soviet conducts much of its debate behind closed doors, and it usually sup-
 ports the President; however, at the end of 1992 it failed to support the Govern-
 ment's economic "anticrisis" program. The next parliamentary elections are not
 scheduled until December 1994, but opposition groups are demanding earlier elec-
 tions. The Supreme Soviet is considering a new constitution that continues to vest
 most political power in the President.
 Kazakhstan has nationalized the Commonwealth of Independent States' forces
 stationed on its territory but has yet to gain full control of them. The Committee
 for State Security (KGB) has been reorganized as the Committee for National Secu-
 rity (KNB). In many respects it is a continuation of the old KGB. The law defining
 its role gives it authority to deny permission to travel in and out of the country,
 to requisition property, and to demand cooperation by citizens (e.g., to inform on
 other citizens). The criminal police are organized under the Ministry of Internal Af-
 fairs.
 Although Kazakhstan is rich in natural resources, its economy, like those of the
 other states of the former Soviet Union, is in crisis. Unemployment is rising, and
 industrial production is declining. The real purchasing power of the population has
 fallen sharply. Basic medicines are in short supply. The Government proceeded with
 economic reforms at a measured pace in hopes of lessening political fallout, and no
 mor privatization measures were adopted.
 The human rights situation is mixed. The transition to pluralistic democracy has
 been slow to materialize, in part due to underlying ethnic tensions. Kazakhs were
 the only titular nationality gup in the Soviet Union that constituted less than a
 majority in its national republic. Although Kazakhs comprise only about 40 percent
 of the population, they predominate in the Government and discriminate against
 non-Kazakhs, in part out of a sense that they themselves were discriminated
 against under Russian colonial rule and later under the Soviets. The President has
 sought to broker differences among ethnic groups in an effort to forge national
 unity. Freedoms of assembly and religion are generally respected, but freedom of
 movement within the country is limited. The press is increasingly pluralistic, al-
 though there are credible reports of government harassment of independent media
 and of preferential treatment for government-controlled outlets. New political
 groups have appeared, but many have not been allowed to register or operate freely.
 The Government is wary of aggressive opposition activity and has used laws prohib-
 iting unauthorized demonstrations and the insulting of the President to stem it.
 Several persons were imprisoned on charges of insulting the President, and one was
 sent briefly to a psychiatric hospital. Language policy is a source of increasing fric-
 tion between Kazakhs and other ethnic groups.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killings No political or other extrajudicial
 killings are known to have occurred.
 b. Disappearance.-No political disappearances or abductions are known to have
 occurred.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Torture is prohibited by law and generally did not occur. In one incident, however,
 one of three members of the Islamic "Alash" movement arrested on the charges of
 assault, insulting the President, and participating in a violent demonstration at the
 Alma Ata mosque in December 1991, was reportedly taken from jail to a psychiatric
 ward, given a forced injection, and compelled to take a drug (aminazine) against his
 will. In protest, he went on a hunger strike. After 11 days, he was returned to jail.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-With only minor modifications,
 Kazakhstan used the Soviet legal system in 1992. The system may unde o signifi-
 cant change with the adoption of the new constitution, which was being bated in
 the Supreme Soviet as of December 1992.
 Pretrial detention is sanctioned by law. Prosecutors issue arrest warrants. Accord-
 ing to the Criminal Procedure Code, a detainee may be held for 3 days before being
 charged. After 3 days, the detainee may be held with the sanction of a prosecutor
 but no longer than 10 days without being charged. The detainee may be held up
 to 1 year before trial. Detainees are not held incommunicado. Defendants in crimi-
 
 
 815
 
 nal cases have the right to choose an attorney and to appeal the legality of their
 arrest to the prosecutor before trial. If a defendant cannot afford an attorney, the
 State will provide one free of charge. There is no provision for bail. Defendants re-
 main incarcerated until trial. Defendants in political trials, such as those involving
 "insulting" the President, have had difficulty in finding legal counsel. Some lawyers
 fear reprisals if they represent a client unpopular with the Government.
 There were two known arrests during the year with political overtones. The leader
 of the unregistered opposition Kazakh nationalist party Zheltoksan was placed
 under administrative arrest for several days. He was charged with organizing an
 unauthorized demonstration in front of the U.S. Embassy. The demonstration was
 a peaceful one. He stated that the real reason for his arrest was to keep him off
 the streets on June 1, the deadline for his ultimatum to the Government to remove
 all Soviet-era monuments. Zheltoksan members had earlier in the year demolished
 a statue of Soviet Cheka (KGB predecessor) founder Dzerzhinsky.
 Karishal Asanov's arrest for insulting the President also had political implications
 (see Section 2.a.). Asanov was detained for nearly 3 months beiore his trial. He was
 released from prison on the opening day of the trial. The court dismissed Asanov's
 case for lack of evidence.
 The three Alash party members arrested in 1991 (see Section I.e.) were held in
 detention for 9 months before their trial.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-Kazakhstan's court system is based on the Soviet
 court system. The President recommends nominees for Supreme Court and oblast-
 level (provincial) judgeshi ps for Supreme Soviet approval. Regional or city councils
 elect lower level judges. All judges are appointed for 10-year terms. The Supreme
 Soviet established a special, 11-member Constitutional Court in July. Its main func-
 tions are to interpret the Constitution, resolve legal conflicts between oblasts, and
 decide interethnic problems. The Constitutional Court declared a Presidential decree
 "unconstitutional" in December. This represents the first major instance of separa-
 tion of powers at work in Kazakhstan's courts.
 There was one known case of denial of speedy and fair public trial. Three mem-
 bers of the Alash party and two other persons were held in pretrial detention for
 9 months after their arrest following the December 1991 demonstration at the Alma
 Ata mosque. These five, plus two others who were not detained, were charged with
 assault (hooliganism), organizing an unauthorized demonstration, and insulting the
 President. The Alash members received 1-year sentences for hooliganism, with time
 already spent in prison counting toward their sentences. They were released on De-
 cember 15. The two non-Alash members were also convicted of hooliganism: one re-
 ceived a 1-year sentence, and the other, convicted of breaking the arm of the Mufti
 (Islamic religious leader) of Kazakhstan, received a 1  year sentence for
 hooliganism. n addition, two female Alash members were tried(but not detained
 before the trial) for organizing an unauthorized demonstration and insulting the
 President. One was found innocent of insulting the President but guilty of organiz-
 ing an unauthorized demonstration. She received a 1-year sentence of "corrective
 labor" whereby she would be assigned to work at a state institution and pay 20 per-
 cent of her salary to the Government as a fine. The other woman was ound guilty
 of organizing an unauthorized demonstration and insulting the President, calling
 him a "traitor" and a "scoundrel." For the insult, she received I year of corrective
 labor.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-Arbi-
 trary interference with privacy, family, home, and correspondence was pervasive
 during the Soviet era and continues. Criminal police, who remain part of the inter-
 nal security structure, are required by law to have a search warrant from a prosecu-
 tor before conducting a search, but they sometimes search without a warrant. There
 are credible reports that police occasionally plant evidence. In a speech to the Su-
 preme Soviet on the new national security law, the KNB chief said the KNB would
 have the right to continue monitoring telephone calls and mail.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Government permits a more liberal press
 and freer speech than under Soviet rule. Nevertheless, the laws against insulting
 the President and Supreme Soviet deputies contribute to the impulse to self-censor-
 ship, which is already strong because of the history of repression during the Soviet
 era.
 Kazakhstan has hundreds of registered media outlets and a large number of unof-
 ficial publications and radio and television companies. The Government, however,
 has also maintained direct control over a number of media outlets, such as the state
 radio and television, and indirect control over others. The former Communist news-
 paper, Kazakhstanskaya Pravda, is the "official" newspaper, although it sometimes
 
 
 816
 prints articles critical of the Government. Personal relationships, or cronyism, be-
 tween some government officials and individuals in the media limit objectivity. The
 process of privatization in the media is in its begnning stages, and the media in
 92 had few alternatives to using government a        or purchasing broadcasting
 and printing services. To a large extent, the press must still depend on a govern-
 ment-controlled distribution system. The Government uses its power in these cir-
 cumstances, and its control over media registration, to encourage self-censorship.
 Karishal Asanov, a history instructor at Kazakhstan State University and a critic
 of the Government, was arrested on August 19 for insulting the President because
 an article he published implied that President Nazarbayev had slapped a popular
 Cet and political figure. The court dismissed Asanov's case for lack of evidence (see
 1ction 1.d.).
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The current law and Constitu-
 tion provide for freedom of assembly and association, which is usually respected but
 sometimes circumscribed. Prior approval by local authorities is required to hold a
 demonstration. Demonstrations held without prior approval are considered illegal.
 In June, however, the Supreme Soviet rejected a government proposal to place tight-
 er controls on unregistered political groups that engage in "unauthorized activities,
 although the text oT the government proposal was never made public. Also in June,
 several thousand miners demanding higher wages staged a protest march from
 Shakhtinsk to Karaganda (about 50 kilometers) without government interference.
 To participate in elections, a political party must register with the Government.
 To register, a party must submit a list of at least 3,000 members from a minimum
 of 11 difTerent oblasts (Kazakhstan is divided into 19 oblasts or provincial adminis-
 trative units, including two cities having special status, Alma Ata and Leninsk). The
 list must provide personal information about the members, including date and place
 of birth, address, and place of employment. Submitting such personal data to the
 Government recalls for many Kazakhstanis old-style KGB tactics and inhibits them
 from joining parties. Alash and Zheltoksan refused to register as political parties on
 the principle that they should not have to submit personal information about their
 members to the Government. Members of unregistered parties may run for elected
 office as individuals but not as party members.
 Organizations or "movements" that conduct public activity, hold public meetings,
 or participate in conferences must also register with the Government. A minimum
 of 10 members is required to register on the local level, and a minimum of 10 mem-
 bers in at least 11 oblasts is required to register on the republic level.
 Yedinstvo, a primarily ethnic Russian chauvinist group, had registered as a move-
 ment under the preindependence government. The new Government refused to
 reregister Yedinstvo, allegedly because its political agenda-to make Russian an of-
 icialstate language and to assist the police in enforcing law and order when there
 is a "violation" of citizens' rights-would interfere with members' performance of
 their regular jobs. The Government also cited the danger posed if Yedinstvo mem-
 bers organized to help the police, thereby becoming a paramilitary force.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-Freedom of religion is provided by law and generally re-
 spected. Kazakhstan is a relatively secular society. Christians, Muslims, and Jews
 report no interference from the Government or any other source. The Central Com-
 mittee of the Communist Party of Kazakhstan confirmed the current Mufti (Islamic
 religious leader) in his position in 1990.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Constitution provides for the right to emigrate. Government control
 of most housing and requirements for residence permits are obstacles to freedom of
 movement within the country. A permit (propiska) is needed to reside in major
 cities. The requirement for a propiska can function to limit freedom of movement.
 For example, the city administration has limited transfer of residences in Alma Ata
 to people already living in Alma Ata.
 There is favoritism toward ethnic Kazakhs in the transfer of residences. For ex-
 ample, the Alma Ata city administration is more likely to give permission to sell
 or barter a residence if an ethnic Kazakh is to receive the property. The Govern-
 ment acknowledges that it accords special treatment to ethnic Kazakhs moving to
 Kazakhstan from other countries.
 An exit visa is required for travel abroad; while some officials demand bribes for
 issuing one, there have been no known instances of refusals on political grounds.
 Kazakhs in the diaspora-mainly ethnic Kazakhs and their descendants who fled
 because of Stalin's forced collectivization policies in the 1920's and 1930's-are en-
 couraged to return to Kazakhstan. Any ethnic Kazakh living abroad is entitled to
 Kazakhstani citizenship and may retain any other citizenship he or she may already
 have. Anyone else must apply for permission to immigrate and must renounce any
 other citizenship. Ethnic Kazakh citizens already living in Kazakhstan, as well as
 
 
 817
 nonethnic Kazakh citizens, are not permitted to obtain another citizenship without
 losing their Kazakhstani citizenship.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The right of citizens to effect a peaceful, democratic change in their government
 is untested. No multiparty, multicandidate elections have been held in Kazakhstan.
 All men and women above the age of 18 have the right to vote. Shortly before inde-
 pendence, President Nazarbayev won election as the first President of the country,
 the post he held during Soviet rule. He ran unpped in the election and received
 98 percent of the vote. While the President appeared to have brad support, there
 were no international monitors invited to verify that the vote was free and fair. The
 leader of the Zheltoksan party attempted to run against Nazarbayev and alleged
 that the Government used a series of legal technicalities, as well as force, to prevent
 him from fulfilling the requirements to establish his candidacy.
 Supreme Soviet deputies were elected in March 1990 when the Communist party
 retained a monopoly on political power. Ninety percent of them are former memboers
 of the party's nomenklatura (ruling elite). The Supreme Soviet represents oaly a
 modest check on the President's power. It conducts much of its debate behind closed
 doors--the public and diplomats are not allowed to attend-and usually supports
 the President. In the session beginning in December 1992, however, the Supreme
 Soviet failed to support the Governments economic Nanticrisis" program.
 There are three regally registered politica parties: the Socialist P arty (the former
 Communist par), the Social Democratic Party (which broke away from the Com-
 munist party before independence), and the Azat Party, which is largely an ethnic
 Kazakh party. Qaly about 15-20 members of the 360-member Supreme Soviet have
 announced afilyiation with apolitical party. President Nazarbayev is not a member
 of any party. There are a wide variety of unregistered opposition parties and move-
 ments, andwithout registration the are not permitted to participate in elections.
 The Government has refused to register any party whose platform it believes will
 foment ethnic tensions.
 There are no legal restrictions on women participating in politics and government,
 but, owing to discrimination and traditiona attitudes, very few women are profes-
 sionally active in these fields.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The Government did not interfere in the activities of the local Helsinki Watch
 group which monitors observance of human rights. The latter had limited means to
 observe, contest, and report human rights violations but protested such actions as
 the arrest of Karishal Asanov for insultin the President.
 The Government permitted representatives of the American Federation of Labor-
 Congress of Industrial Organizations (AFL-CIO), the International Republican Insti-
 tute (IRI), the National Democratic Institute, human rights groups, and foreign con-
 stitutional lawyers to visit Kazakhstan and contact opposition groups. Some govern-
 ment officials, however, including the KNB chairman, publicly criticized AFL-CIO
 and Ger representatives for meddling in internal affairs by meeting with opposition
 groups.
 In July the Supreme Soviet established a committee on "Human Rights and Depu-
 ties' Powers" to review the legislation of the past 2 years, as well as new legislation,
 to ensure that it conforms to United Nations Universal Declaration of Human
 Rights guidelines.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Language, or Social Status
 Kazakhstan's population of about 17 million is comprised, as of the 1989 census,
 of 42 percent Kazakhs; 38 percent Russians; 7 percent other Slavs; and smaller pop-
 ulations of Germans, Uzbeks, Tatars, Uighurs, Koreans, and scores of other ethnic
 groups.
 Ethnic Slavs and others are concerned about the increasing discrimination in
 favor of ethnic Kazakhs in employment in government and state-controlled enter-
 prises as well as in education, housing, and other areas. Although some officials are
 Slays, ethnic Kazakhs increasingly predominate in government and in higher posi-
 tions in state enterprises. The Supreme Soviet, for instance, has 360 deputies, of
 whom only 80 arc not ethnic Kazakhs. Nonetheless, President Nazarbayev has pub-
 licly emphasized that all nationalities are welcome and entitled to equal treatment
 under the law in Kazakhstan. Many ethnic Kazakhs, however, believe they were
 second-class citizens under Russian domination for 200 years. Under Communist
 rule, Kazakh and other minority languages and cultures were repressed.
 
 
 818
 Kazakhstan's language law, due to go into effect in 1995 declares that Kazakh
 is the official language of the State and Russian the official language of interethnic
 communication. In late 1992, President Nazarbayev roposed that Russian will have
 "equal status" with Kazakh and that no citizen of Kazakhstan should be discrimi-
 nated against on the basis of language. The Supreme Soviet, however, opposed this
 formulation. The Government is increasingly using Kazakh for official purposes. Of-
 ficial television programming is largely inKazakh, but private television broadcasts
 and newspapers are mostly in Russian. Less than half of the population speaks
 Kazakh; everyone speaks Russian except some less educated people in rural areas.
 Having become a major political issue, the way in which the law is implemented
 could greatly affect interethnic relations. It remains unclear which branch of govern-
 ment will interpret the language law. The Government has not yet initiated signifi-
 cant activity to provide more Kazakh language education.
 There is no de jure discrimination against women, but women are severely
 underrepresented in higher positions in government and state enterprises and over-
 represented in low-paying and some menial jobs. Women are disadvantaged in pro-
 motions, but they generally have access to higher education. Several women's orga-
 nizations exist, including the Union of Women of Kazakhstan, the Union of Women
 Entrepreneurs, and the League of Muslim Women.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Kazakhstan inherited a system of state-sponsored
 trade unions from the former Soviet Union. At the vast majority of enterprises, 1
 percent of a worker's wages is automatically deducted as dues to the state union.
 These unions also control important social benefits (e.g., housing, vacation retreats).
 Often they use such power coercively to enforce labor discipline.
 All workers are legally entitled to join or form unions of their own choosing and
 stop the automatic dues deductions for the state union. Workers are entitled to join
 unions under the current Constitution. The new constitution is being debated by the
 Supreme Soviet. To obtain legal status, an independent union must apply for reg-
 istration with the local judicial authority at the oblast level and with the Ministry
 of Justice at the republic level. Registration is generally a lengthy and difficult proc-
 ess. The decision to register a union appears to be arbitrary, with no published cri-
 teria.
 In Kentau, oblast authorities refused to register an independent trade union on
 the grounds that the union's charter excluded management from membership, which
 is expressly prohibited by Kazakhstan's law on trade unions. Eventually, the trade
 union changed its charter to conform to Kazakhstan's law and submitted a new ap-
 plication for registration. Approval of the new application is still pending. The local
 government approved its registration on December 18.
 Judicial authorities and the Ministry of Justice also have the authority to cancel
 a union's registration. In September a state coal mining enterprise, Karaganda
 Ugol, wrote a letter to the oblast judicial administration asserting that the local free
 trade union (which had won major concessions in a strike earlier in the year) was
 illegal and that local conditions did not warrant existence of an independent trade
 union. Allegedly on the basis of this letter the authorities revoked the registration
 of the independent coal miners' union of karaganda and froze its bank accounts.
 The union appealed the revocation of its registration to the oblast court, which de-
 cided in favor of the union.
 Workers who have joined independent unions have been subjected to various
 forms of harassment, including firing, transfer to lower paying or lower status jobs,
 threats, and intimidation. A leader of the Karaganda independent trade union was
 severely beaten by unknown assailants in December. It is not known whether the
 beating was related in any way to his union activities. State unions often take an
 active part in the harassment to inhibit challenges to their hegemony and to pres-
 sure new unions. During the summer, the state unions wrote to the National Bank
 demanding that it transfer social benefit accounts of independent unions to state
 unions. The independent unions appealed to the general prosecutor. Accounts are
 now frozen pending resolution. The state unions sent a similar demand to private
 banks, which did not comply.
 Western trade union representatives who have visited Kazakhstan note obvious
 hostility toward independent union activity by local authorities and state-sponsored
 trade unions. About 250,000 workers out of Kazakhstan's work force of 5,600,000
 have joined independent unions.
 Unions have the legal right to strike, and several major strikes occurred in 1992.
 In Karaganda, the Independent Coal Miners Union (NPG) went on strike against
 Karaganda Ugol for better wages and the right to a percentage of the total coal
 mined. The union and management negotiated' a compromise that ended the strike.
 
 
 Several months later, however, management persuaded the Karaganda oblast au-
 thority to revoke the union's registration. The oblast court later overturned the rev-
 ocation.
 In Kentau some 13,000 miners went on strike in July after not being paid for
 3 months. Miners also went on strike in Tekele, demanding higher wages. In both
 instances, they negotiated settlements with management or government representa-
 tives. Physicians and other health workers went on strike im June to protest low
 wages and joined the June demonstrations against the Government.
 By law, unions may freely join federations or confederations and affiliate with
 international bodies. All independent trade unions are members of the Independent
 Trade Union Center headquartered in Alma Ata. The independent unions are not
 yet members of international federations but do maintain contacts with European
 and U.S. trade union federations.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-There are significant limits
 on the right to organize and bargain collectively. Most industry remains state owned
 and is subject to the state's production orders. Although collective bargaining rights
 are not spelled out in law, in some instances independent unions have successfully
 negotiated agreements with management. If a union's demands are not acceptable
 to management, they may be presented to an arbitration commission comprised of
 management, union officials, and independent technical experts. There is no law
 against antiunion discrimination.
 There are no export processing zones. Several free economic zones exist, but labor
 conditions there appear to be no different than elsewhere in Kazakhstan.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced labor is prohibited by law.
 Compulsory labor, however is used to gather the annual grain harvest. Some per-
 sons are required to provide labor or the use of privately owned equipment, with
 no or very low compensation, to help gather the harvest on state-owned farms. Uni-
 versity-level students also are required to help with the harvest at minimal com-
 pensation.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The minimum age for employment
 is 16. A child under age 16 may work only with the permission of the local adminis-
 tration and the trade union in the enterprise at which the child would work. Such
 permission is rarely granted. Abuse of child labor is generally not a problem, except
 that child labor is used during the harvest, especially the cotton harvest in the
 south.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-There is no universal minimum wage that cov-
 ers all employment sectors. The legal minimum wages for specific sectors are far
 behind the rate of inflation and do not provide a worker and family a decent stand-
 ard of living. The current economic crisis has made implementing and enforcing a
 meaningful minimum wage difficult.
 The legal maximum workweek is 48 hours, although most enterprises maintain
 a 40-hour workweek. Working and safety conditions in Kazakhstan's industry are
 substandard. For example workers in factories often do not wear protective cloth-
 ing, such as goggles and hard hats, and work in conditions of poor visibility and
 ventilation. Economic dislocation is a major cause of shortages of safety equipment.
 The regulations concerning occupational health and safety, enforceable by the Min-
 istry of Labor and the state-sponsored unions, are largely ignored by management
 and are not enforced. Lack of management concern as well as economic dislocation,
 resulting in shortages of hard hats and other safety equipment, are responsible.
