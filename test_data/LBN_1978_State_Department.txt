 LEBANON
 
 Despite its efforts the Lebanese Government has found
 it extremely difficult to restore security and respect
 for law and order throughout most of the country.
 Tripoli, in the north, and the Bekaa in the east,
 particularly because of a strong Arab Deterrent Force
 (ADF) presence, are positive exceptions, as are the
 Christian mountain areas, at least for those not known
 to be opposed to the two armed Christian groups. In
 most other areas, basic human rights of Lebanese
 citizens continue to be violated. The security of
 individuals in southern Lebanon, despite the presence
 of a United Nations Peacekeeping Force, is at the
 mercy of Palestinian and Israel-supported de facto
 forces recently in conflict. The following abuses
 are among the most serious which can be cited.
 In March 1978, after Israeli military action in
 southern Lebanon, upwards of two hundred thousand
 villagers fled from their homes, often with only the
 few possessions they could carry with them. A substan-
 tial number of civilian casualties also resulted from
 the fighting and from Israeli air attacks near Beirut.
 Thousands of refugees were forced to flee their homes
 in Beirut after fighting between Maronite militias and
 Syrian forces which reached a peak in early October
 1978.
 Also in March a score or more of aged Muslim villagers
 were massacred in southern Lebanon. Palestinian
 guerrillas in the area had earlier been accused of
 similar atrocities.
 On June 13 armed Christian militiamen attacked the
 town of Ihdin in northern Lebanon, killing the leader
 of a rival Christian faction, his wife, his three
 year old daughter and about 30 other people.

 During the night of July 27-28 some Christian men
 were abducted from villages in northeastern Lebanon
 and over 30 were subsequently murdered. Although
 the evidence is not conclusive, credible accusa-
 tions have been made that some elements of the
 Syrian Army were involved.
 Fighting among rival factions of Christian militias
 and among competing Palestinian guerrilla groups
 has become almost a daily occurrence in and around
 Beirut. Innocent bystanders are often caught in
 the cross fire.
 Criminal activity and extortion, sometimes masquerading
 as political activity, were endemic throughout 1978
 in the absence of effective Lebanese security forces.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 Private militias beyond the control of the central
 government have tortured and killed their opponents.
 Militia forces in southern Lebanon, for example, are
 widely rumored to maintain a clandestine prison and
 torture chamber. Such facilities have long been a
 feature of Lebanese and Palestinian militia installa-
 tions throughout Lebanon. No charges of torture have
 been brought against the Government's own security
 forces.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Militia factions and occasionally Syrian troops in
 Lebanon have engaged in beatings of opponents and
 other acts of brutality.
 c. Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 In efforts to suppress the illegal activities of armed
 gangs, Syrian forces have detained alleged partisans
 of one group or another without benefit of due process.

 The number of persons detained by the Syrian forces
 is unknown to the Department of State.
 d. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 It is impossible to conduct normal judicial processes
 in the present climate of pervasive insecurity. Crim-
 inal trials cannot be held because of intimidation of
 judicial officials, and sentences cannot be carried
 out.
 e. Invasion of the Home
 In the absence of effective Lebanese security forces
 and given the presence of armed gangs throughout the
 country, no Lebanese home is safe from intrusion.
 2. Governmental Policies Relating to the Fulfillment
 of Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care
 and Education
 The present Government has concentrated on planning
 for economic development and reconstruction but has
 been unable to make much progress, given the climate
 of insecurity and the absence of a national political
 consensus. In March after Israeli military action in
 southern Lebanon created more than 200,000 refugees
 and again after fighting in early October in Beirut,
 the Government delivered relief supplies to displaced
 families.
 3. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Includ-
 ing:
 a. Freedom of Thought, Speech, Press, Religion
 and Assembly
 Lebanon's Constitution guarantees freedoms of speech,
 press, assembly and association "within the limits
 established by law." Prior to the recent civil con-
 flict, there were virtually no restrictions on free
 expression. Although Lebanon's press is now subject
 to censorship, the main impediment to freedom of
 
 
 590
 thought and expression arises not from governmental
 action but from the intimidation by private armed
 groups of persons holding opinions with which they
 disagree. This intimidation has sometimes threatened
 to prevent the distribution of newspapers and has a
 chilling effect on the traditionally lively intellec-
 tual life of Lebanon. Freedom of assembly also is
 circumscribed under present conditions. Articles nine
 and ten of the Lebanese Constitution guarantee free-
 dom of conscience and education, but religious dis-
 tinctions are sharply drawn, and the highest offices
 in the state as well as parliamentary seats are
 allocated on the basis of religious affiliation.
 The right to worship freely, however, is assured in
 law and in practice.
 Workers, except those engaged in agriculture and
 domestic service or those employed by the civil ser-
 vice, are free to organize. Trade union formation
 must be authorized by the Ministry of Labor and
 Social Affairs, however, and the Labor Code prohibits
 trade unions from engaging in political activities.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel and Emigration
 There are no legal or administrative hindrances to
 freedom of movement and the right to emigrate and
 travel abroad. Present security conditions inhibit
 freedom of movement within Lebanon.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 As indicated by the proliferation of Lebanese political
 parties and pressure groups, Lebanese continue to be
 free to organize themselves for political participation.
 Parliamentary debate can be suspended under the emer-
 gency powers granted the Government by Parliament
 itself. Cultural traditions prevent many but not all
 women from participating in the political process.
 Women have the same legal rights as men to political
 participation.

 4. Government Attitude and Record Regarding Inter-
 national and Non-governmental Investigation of
 Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 No independent investigations of violations of human
 rights have been carried out by groups inside or
 outside Lebanon. To the knowledge of the Department of
 State, no such investigations were requested in 1978.
 Objective investigations of human rights violations
 probably would be resisted by those who stand to be
 accused, and probably could not be carried out effec-
 tively under current circumstances. It is not likely
 that the Lebanese Government would oppose such investi-
 gations, but it would be unable to help much in
 carrying them out.
