 MONGOLIA
 Mongolia continued to move slowly and steadily in its transition from a highly
 centralized Communist-led state to a full-fledged multi party democracy. The Prime
 Minister is nominated by the President and approved by the State Great Hural
 (SGH), the national legislature. The Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party
 (MPRP), the lineal descendant of the former ruling Communist Party, dominates the
 unicameral legislature. In part due to the multiplicity of candidates, the MPRP gar-
 nered 71 of the 76 seats in the SGH with less than 60 percent of the popular vote
 in the 1992 parliamentary elections. This imbalance, which prompted a lingering
 sense of disenfranchisement among opposition parties, led in the autumn of 1995
 to the consideration of changes in the parliamentary electoral law from a strictly
 majority system to a mixed one of majority and proportional representation. In Jan-
 uary 1996, the ruling MPRP passed, over the objections of the other parties and in
 a move protested by the President, a law mandating the creation of 76 new single
 constituencies to be defined sometime before the June 1996 parliamentary elections.
 The popularly elected President and the Prime Minister together nominate cabinet
 officers, who must also receive SGH approval.
 Security forces are under civilian control. Reduced government spending caused
 continued downsizing of the military. The Mongolian Central Intelligence Agency
 (MCIA) is responsible for internal security; its head has ministerial status and re-
 ports directly to the Prime Minister. Some members of the security forces committed
 occasional human rights abuses on detainees and prisoners.
 The economy, while still featuring yearly inflation rates of 40 to 50 percent, con-
 tinued to expand and strengthen. Its basis remains copper production, livestock
 raising by the majority of the nonurban population, and related food-, wool-, and
 hide-processing industries which supply both internal needs and goods for export.
 A growing trade and small entrepreneurial sector in urban areas provides basic
 consumer goods. Minerals, particularly copper, continue to provide the bulk of ex-
 
 
 679
 port earnings. An unreliable energy system and lack of transportation infrastructure
 i    r national development and discourage foreign investment.
 The Government generally respected the human rights of its citizens, although
 problems remain including occasional abuse of detainees and prisoners by security
 forces, restrictions on due process for detainees, and violence against women.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person Including Freedom from:
 a. Pal itical and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political
 killings.
 Several dozen prisoners died in custody, at least partially due to inadequate man-
 agement and overight y the authorities (see Section 1.c.).
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Tortue and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Although the Constitution forbids such practices, there were credible reports that
 police and prison officials sometimes beat or otherwise physically abuse prisoners
 and detainees. Detention facilities are Spartan, and conditions in them-including
 insufficient food and heating-continue to a threaten the health of detainees. There
 is no evidence of a pattern of deliberate abuse, or of a policy of withholding food
 or other necessities as punishment.
 The deaths of several dozen prisoners from unclear health-related causes, how-
 ever, appears at least partially attributable to negligence and inadequate oversight.
 With the continuing rise in crime and subsequent rise in the prison and pretrial de-
 tainee population, severe crowding in bth prisons and detention facilities is com-
 mon, aggavating management and resource issues.
 d. Arbitray Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution provides that no person
 shall be searched, arrested, detained, or deprived of liberty except by law, but these
 protections have not been fully codified. Under the Legal Code, police may arrest
 those caught committing a crime and hold them for up to 72 hours without a war-
 rant. A warrant must be issued by a prosecutor for incarceration of longer duration
 or when the actual crime was not witnessed. A detainee has no statutory right
 under the Code to see an attorney, and defense attorneys are often denied access
 to their clients before trial.
 The Government does not practice forced exile.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution provides for an independent judi-
 ciary. The courts are independent, and there is no evidence that they discriminate
 against any group, or that decisions are made for political reasons.
 The court system consists of local courts, provincial courts, a Constitutional Court,
 the Supreme Court, and a 12-member General Council of Courts. The 17-member
 Supreme Court is at the ape of the judicial system, and it hears appeals from lower
 courts. The local courts hear mostly routine criminal and civil cases; provincial
 courts hear the more serious cases including those of rape, murder, and grand lar-
 ceny, and they also serve as the appeals court for lower court decisions. The Con-
 stitutional Court considers constitutional questions and cases involving alleged mis-
 conduct by high-ranking government officials. The General Council, an independent
 body, nominates candidates for vacancies on both the Supreme and lower courts; the
 President has the power to ratily or refuse to approve such nominations.
 All accused persons are guaranteed due process, legal defense, and a public trial,
 although closed proceedings are permitted in cases involving crimes against the
 State, rape cases involving minors, and particularly brutal murders.
 The Constitutional Court has sole jurisdiction in matters involving constitutional
 issues and over criminal charges leveled against high government officials, e.g. cor-
 rupton.
 Tere were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution provides that the State shal not interfere with the private beliefs and
 actions of citizens, and the Government generally respects this in practice. The head
 of the MCIA may, with the knowledge and consent of the Prime Minister, direct the
 monitoring and recording of telephone conversations. The extent of such monitoring
 is unknown.
 During a 5-month long teachers' strike a listening device was found in a police
 jacket which had been left at the headquarters of the temporary strike committee.
 Both the police and the MCIA denied knowledge of, and responsibility for, the de-
 vice's placement, but many of those involved in the job action viewedthe incident
 as a government attempt to harass and intimidate the strikers. In the late autumn,
 an H   investigatory committee made the judgment that responsibility for the
 
 
 680
 placement of the device did rest with the police, and it called for the resignation
 of the head of police.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for the rights of free-
 dom of speech press, and expression. The Government generally respects these
 rights in practice.
 A growing range of newspapers and other publications represent major political
 party viewpoints as well as independent views. Although in the past the Govern-
 ment controlled access to newsprint, all newspapers now buy newsprint directly
 from private suppliers, and neither party-affiliated nor independent news media re-
 port difficulty securing an adequate supply. Due to transportation difficulties, un-
 even postal service, and fluctuations in the amount of newsprint available, access
 to the full range of publications is somewhat restricted in outlying regions.
 Draft legislation dealing with press freedom and the rights of assembly, promised
 as art of the settlement of the 1994 hunger strike, has yet to be considered by the
 There is a government-financed television station with countryide reception, as
 well as a new, limited operation private television channel, and several radio sta-
 tions. The latter are particularly important as the major sources of current news
 in the countryside. Both official and private media present opposition and govern-
 ment views.
 Academic freedom is evident, although there continues to be a severe shortage of
 teaching materials at all educational levels.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 these rights, and the Government respects them in practice. The lengthy teachers'
 strike included many demonstrations and assemblies, and there were no reports
 that the public assembly permit process was used to limit the right of assembly or
 association.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for the right both to worship
 and not to worship and explicitly recognizes the separation of church and state. The
 Government generally respects these provisions in practice. Although Mongolia has
 no state religion, the Government has contributed to the restoration of several Bud-
 dhist sites important as religious, historical, and cultural centers.
 Although under the provisions of a 1993 law on relations between church and
 state, the Government may supervise and limit the numbers of both places of wor-
 ship and clergy for organized religions, there are no reports that it has done so. Reli-
 gious groups must, however, reginster with the Ministry of Justice. Proselytizing is
 allowed, although a Ministry of Education directive bans the mixing of foreign lan-
 guage or other training with religious teaching or instruction. Contacts with coreli-
 gionists outside the country ae allowed.
 d. Freedom of Mooement Within the Country, Foreign Travel. Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.r-The Constitution provides for freedom of movement within the country
 as well as the right to travel and return without restriction, and the Government
 generally respects these rights in practice. A regulation which took effect in Decem-
 ber mandates that some categories of foreigners who wish to travel for more than
 a week must notify police authorities in their projected destination of their plans.
 The Government cooperates with the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees and
 other humanitarian organizations in assisting refugees in the small number of cases
 reported where such status has been claimed. There were no reports of forced expul-
 sion of those having a valid claim to refugee status.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The Constitution provides citizens with the right to change their government
 through periodic, free elections via secret ballot, with universal suffrage. The cur-
 rent plurality-takes-all election law, plus a multiplicity of candidates in each con-
 stituency, led in the 1992 parliamentary elections to a legislature overwhelmingly
 dominated by the MPRP, which won 71 of 76 seats with less than 60 percent of the
 popular vote. This imbalance led to calls for election law revision, and in the fall
 the SGH began consideration of several amendments, including one creating a
 mixed electoral system with some of the SGH seats to be decided by proportional
 representations. In January 1996, the ruling MPRP passed, over the objections of
 other parties, a bill mandating not a mixed electoral system, byt 76 single constitu-
 encies to be defined sometime before the June 1996 parliamentary elections. The
 President protested the bill but decided to let it become law as it was passed by
 a majority of legislators. There are currently 12 registered political parties.
 
 
 There are no legal impediments to the participation of women in government and
 politics, but they are underrepresented proportionate to their share of the popu-
 lation in the highest levels of the Government and in the highest echelons of the
 judiciary. Although there are significant numbers of women in various midlevel min-
 istry positions, none are to be found in the Cabinet, the Supreme or Constitutional
 Courts, and only a few of them in the legislature. Underrepresentation of women
 at the highest levels of government and the professions has several causes, includ-
 ing tradition and some degree of discrimination by the virtually all-male web of
 leadership.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitudes Regarding International and Nongovernmental
 Investigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 A number of human rights groups operate without government restriction, inves-
 tigating and publishing their findings on human rights cases. Government officials
 are generally cooperative and responsive to their questions. There is an Inter-
 national Committee of the Red Cross representative resident in Mongolia, and the
 Government has welcomed visits by representatives of other groups interested in
 human rights.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution states that ... no person shall be discriminated against on the
 basis of ethnic origin, language, race, age, sex, social origin, or status" and that
 "... men and women shal be equal in political, economic, social, cultural fields,
 and family affairs." The Government generally enforces these rights in practice.
 While there is no evident discrimination in terms of access to education or salary,
 women are prohibited by law from working in certain occupations requiring either
 heay labor or exposure to chemicals which could affect infant and maternal health.
 Women.lThere is growing public discussion of domestic violence, including spous-
 al and child abuse after many years of government and social denial. Although
 there are no reliable or exact statistics of the extent of such abuse, human rights
 groups believe it is a common phenomenon. The large economic and societal changes
 under way have created new stresses on the family, including loss of jobs, inflation
 and lowered spending on social and educational programs. These factors, coupled
 with the serious problems caused by extremely high rates of alcohol abuse, have led
 to increased instances of family abuse and abandonment and added to the ranks of
 single-parent families, most of which are headed by women. Although women's
 groups are advocating new statutes to cope with domestic violence, at present there
 is no known police or government intervention in cases involving violence against
 women beyond prosecution under existing assault laws when formal charges have
 been filed.
 The Constitution provides men and women with equal rights in all spheres and
 both by law and practice, women receive equal pay for equal work and have equal
 access to education. Women represent about half the work force, and a significant
 number are the primary earners for their families. Although many women occupy
 midlevel positions in government and the professions, and many are involved in the
 creation and management of new trading and manufacturing businesses, women are
 almost completely absent from the highest leadership ranks of both the public and
 private sectors. There is no government agency overseeing women's rights, nor are
 there any notable efforts by the Government to encourage greater representation by
 women in policymaking positions.
 A small number of women's rights groups concern themselves with such issues as
 maternal and children's health and domestic violence.
 Children.-Increased stress on the family structure and in society has had direct
 effects on many children, and the Government has been unable to keep pace with
 all of the educational, health, and social needs of the most rapidly growing share
 of its population. There are growing numbers of infants and small children or-
 phaned by maternal deaths and desertion and, in Ulaanbaatar and the major urban
 centers, growing numbers of street children. The Government is committed in prin-
 ciple to children's rights and welfare, but it provides only minimal support for what
 shelters and orphanages do exist, and those facilities must turn to private sources
 to sustain their activities. Mongolia has a long tradition of support for, and often
 communal raising of, children. The Government has been reluctant to admit the ex-
 tent of the problem and slow to take steps to improve the welfare of children who
 have become the victims of larger societal and familial changes.
 People With Disabilities.-There is no discrimination against disabled persons in
 employment and education, and the Government provides benefits to the disabled
 according to the nature and severity of the disability. Those who have been injured
 
 
 682
 in industrial accidents have the right to be reemployed when ready to resume work.
 The Government also provides tax benefits to enterprises which hire the disabled,
 and some firms do so exclusively. There is no legislation mandating access for the
 disabled.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution entitles all workers to form or join
 union and professional organizations of their own choosing. Union officials estimate
 that union membership now totals over 400,000, somewhat less than half the work
 force. Union membership rolls are decreasing as the economy shifts from large en-
 terprises and as increasing numbers of workers become either self-employed or work
 at small, nonunionized firms. Most union members are affiliated with the Mongolian
 Trade Unions Confederation (MTUC), but some are affiliated with the newer Asso-
 ciation of Free Trades Unions (AFTU). Both organizations have ties with inter-
 national labor organizations and confederations in other countries. No arbitrary re-
 strictions exist on who may be a union official, and such officers are elected by se-
 cret ballot.
 Union members have the right to strike. Those employed in essential services,
 which the Government defines as occupations critical for national defense and safe-
 y e.g., police, utility, and transportation workers do not have the right to strike.
 The teachers' strike, which began in April and which several local courts refused
 to declare illegal, was the first major strike by civil servants and the only recorded
 strike of the year.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectiely.-In theory, wage levels and
 other employment issues are decided in tripartite contract negotiations between em-
 ployer, union, and government representatives. The Government's role is limited to
 ensuring that the contract meets legal requirements as to hours and conditions of
 work. In practice, wages and other conditions of employment are set mainly by the
 emp~loyer, whether that employer is a private firm or the Government.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The law specifically prohibits
 forced or compulsory labor. However, most members of the military forces are re-
 quired to help with the fall harvest.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The law prohibits children under
 the age of 16 from working, although those age 14 and 15 may do so with parental
 consent. Those under 18 years of age may not work at night, engage in arduous
 work, or work in dangerous occupations such as mining and construction. Enforce-
 ment of these prohibitions, as well as all other labor regulations, is the responsibil-
 ity of state labor inspectors assigned to regional and local offices. These inspectors
 have the authority to compel immediate compliance with labor legislation, but en-
 forcement is limited due to the small number of labor inspectors and the growing
 number of independent enterprises.
 A significant number of children leave school early to work, often to help tend
 family herds.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The monthly minimum legal wage is $17.06
 (7,680 tugriks) per month, or 12.2V (37 tugriks) per hour, effective in July. This
 level applies to public and private sector workers alike and is enforced by the Min-
 istry of Population Policy and Labor. This is the lowest wage for manual labor, such
 as janitorial work; virtually all civil servants make more than this amount, and
 many in private businesses earn considerably more. The minimum wage alone is in-
 sufficient to provide a decent standard of living for a worker and family.
 Labor law sets the standard legal workweek at 46 hours and establishes a mini-
 mum rest period of 42 hours between workweeks. For those under 18 years of age,
 the workweek is 36 hours, and overtime work is not allowed. Overtime work is com-
 pensated at either double the standard hourly rate or by giving time off equal to
 the number of hours worked overtime. Pregnant women and nursing mothers are
 prohibited by law from working overtime.
 Laws on labor cooperatives, and enterprises set occupational health and safety
 standards, and the Ministry of Population Policy and Labor provides enforcement.
 According to labor law, workers have the right to remove themselves from dan-
 gerous work situations and still retain their jobs. Mongolia's near total reliance on
 outmoded machinery and problems with maintenance and management lead to fre-
 quent industrial accidents, particularly in the mining, power, and construction sec-
 tors. Effective enforcement of existing occupational health and safety standards is
 difficult because the Labor Ministry has less than 40 full-time inspectors to cover
 all firms, including a growing number of small enterprises. Some of the major indus-
 trial sectors, however, have part-time inspectors.
