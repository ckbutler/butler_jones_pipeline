 KENYA
 Kenya formally became a one-party state on June 9, 1982 upon
 passage of a constitutional amendment by its one party legis-
 lature making the Kenya African National Union the country's
 sole political party. However, the party has no official
 ideology and is for all practical purposes impotent in national
 politics. From an analytical point of view, Kenya might better
 be described as a "no-party system." The range of tolerated
 political activities in Kenya and within the party remains
 fairly broad, but political power and authority ultimately rest
 with President Moi. He sets the tone and parameters of politi-
 cal participation in Kenya. Private enterprise is practiced and
 encouraged, and the Kenyan Government has moved during the past
 year to strengthen the private sector as one means of battling
 against its current economic crisis.
 Kenya conducted peaceful general elections, within the restric-
 tive one party framework, on September 26, 1983. Parliamentary
 seats were generally contested by five or six candidates selected
 or approved by the party. Approximately 35 percent of the
 incumbents were defeated. National elections have occurred
 on a regular schedule throughout Kenya's 20 years of independ-
 ence. Since 1969 these have been conducted within a de facto
 one party framework.
 The Kenyan Constitution pledges protection for fundamental
 rights and liberties. Routine criminal or civil cases are
 conducted free from outside governmental pressure or interfer-
 ence. As such, the Kenyan judiciary normally operates as an
 independent entity free from direction or coercion of central
 political authorities. In highly political cases, however, many
 Kenyan judges are prepared to place political pragmatism above
 judicial integrity. In the wake of the attempted August 1, 1982
 coup and associated investigations and prosecutions, Kenya's
 earlier constraints of fundamental freedoms tightened somewhat
 more.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section I Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Unlawful or Arbitrary Deprivation of Life
 Kenya does not sanction or practice unlawful or arbitrary
 deprivation of life. Kenyan law provides for capital punish-
 ment, but it is rarely meted out, and due process is observed.
 Of the 11 Kenyan servicemen sentenced to death for treason in
 connection with the attempted coup of August 1, 1982, two have
 been acquitted on appeal, none have been executed, and appeals
 continue. On June 1, 1983, three policemen were found guilty by
 the high court of Kenya for the murder of a suspect in police
 custody and were sentenced to death. Their cases are now under
 appeal.
 b. Disappearance
 The Government of Kenya does not sanction and has not practiced
 secret arrests, abductions, or other types of disappearances.

 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Torture is specifically forbidden under the Kenyan Constitution,
 and such allegations against Kenyan authorities are investi-
 gated. On July 27, 1983 six policemen were acquitted of having
 beaten a prisoner to death in Wajir district; the six had been
 in police custody since charges were brought against them in
 December 1981 (murder is a non-bailable offense in Kenya). The
 Government has never made public the results of its 1982 invest-
 igation into the alleged misconduct on the part of Muranga and
 Gatundu policemen. It is not known whether the allegations of
 torture were substantiated or whether the policemen were
 disciplined.
 Persons formally detained under provisions of the Public
 Security Act are held under spartan conditions: solitary
 confinement, no access to outside information, no bed, and
 virtually no visitors (Kenya's current detainees have averaged
 less than one family visit each per year).
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The Public Security Act is an omnibus law which includes
 regulations superseding constitutional safeguards. The Act
 empowers the state to undertake, without reference or recourse
 to the judiciary or other governmental authority, actions over a
 wide range of circumstances to control the activities of indi-
 viduals that would otherwise be regarded as lawful. Since first
 resorting to detention on May 27, 1982, the Moi Government has
 formally detained or restricted 13 persons under the Act; five
 of these individuals were released in October 1983. Current
 detainees include two former members of parliament, university
 professors, a journalist and Kenya's former Deputy Director of
 Intelligence. Amnesty International, in its 1983 report cover-
 ing events in 1982 expressed concern over the indefinite deten-
 tion without trial of prisoners of conscience and the imprison-
 ment of certan political opponents of the regime on charges of
 sedition.
 Aside from the Publi. Security Act, Kenyan law does not
 provide for preventie detention, but many persons were held
 for months without charges pending completion of investiga-
 tions of the attempt-d coup staged by members of the Kenyan
 Air Force on August ., 1982. On February 22, 1983, President
 Moi ordered the release of 412 ex-servicemen and 61 university
 students who had been held on suspicion of complicity in the
 coup attempt. On March 4, 1983, Moi ordered the release of an
 additional 124 former members of the Kenyan Air Force. On June
 I, 1983, Moi authorized the release of 22 civilians who had been
 held without charges since August 1, 1982. On the same date,
 Moi also granted amnesty to approximately 8,500 common criminals
 (approximately one-quarter of Kenya's prison population).
 Aside from the circumstances created by the events of August 1,
 1982, habeas corpus has generally been adhered to in Kenya.
 Kenyan law requires that persons charged with crimes be brought
 before public court bi-weekly to insure that government authori-
 ties proceed with investigations and that prisoners are not
 mistreated.
 
 
 181
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The right of a fair public trial is practiced in Kenya aside
 from the detention cases mentioned above. It is not known how
 many remain detained under the Public Security Act, but as noted
 above, four major releases of detainees occurred during 1983.
 Civilians are invariably tried in civilian courts, and verdicts
 may be appealed to the Kenyan High Court in all instances. In
 cases involving civilians under the Public Security Act, the
 authority of the regular courts is limited to ensuring compli-
 ance with the procedural provisions of the Act. Officials
 charged with reviewing the cases of detainees meet on a regular
 basis to carry out their responsibilities under the law. The
 Act contains 24 sub-paragraphs which outline various detainee
 rights and procedural requirements including appearance before
 the review tribunal, access to legal counsel, prisoner corres-
 pondence, medical, and spiritual counseling.
 Members of the press have regularly been allowed to attend
 and report on court proceedings whether civilian trials or
 military courts martial. Legal proceedings involving both
 military and civilian participants in the August 1, 1982
 coup attempt have been routinely and extensively covered by
 local media.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The sanctity of the home is generally respected in Kenya, but
 security officials sometimes do conduct unwarranted and illegal
 searches (usually in poorer neighborhoods) in order to seize
 allegedly stolen property or apprehend purported criminals.
 Many poorer Kenyans in Nairobi lost lawful property which was
 confiscated by Kenyan authorities during the searches and
 investigations which occurred following the August 1, 1982 coup
 attempt.
 Kenyan law does not prohibit the use of tribal languages.
 However, during the 1983 election campaign, Kenyan administra-
 tive officials frequently prevented candidates from speaking to
 their constituents in anything other than Kenya's two official
 languages, English and Kiswahili.
 Correspondence with prisoners is monitored, censored, and fre-
 quently not delivered. In isolated instances, security forces
 have employed surveillance techniques and electronic invasion of
 the home.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Freedom of speech and the press are proclaimed in the Consti-
 tution. In practice, however, these freedoms can be and have
 been narrowly interpreted by Kenyan authorities (e.g., during
 the 1983 election campaign candidates were prohibited from
 publicly discussing the "traitor affair" which is a reference
 to the ouster of the Minister of Constitutional Affairs on
 grounds of his alleged plotting against the Government). The
 existence and recent use of the detention provisions of the
 
 
 182
 Public Security Act inhibit public exchange of views on politi-
 cal subjects, as does government pressure brought to bear on
 journalists and publications which stray too far from the
 government line. In April and May of 1983, official party daily
 newspapers in English and Kiswahili were established, thereby
 making Kenyan Government views on a wide variety of issues more
 explicit and tacitly reducing the leeway available to other
 publications in discussing public issues.
 Kenya has no formal censorship of the press, but journalists
 deviating from informal government guidelines can expect
 close government scrutiny. In April and May 1983, Kenya's
 leadinq newspaper, the Daily Nation, carried several articles
 on police harassment of one of its correspondents for his
 critical reporting on the activities of various Kenyan land
 holding companies. Following the publication of a Daily Nation
 editorial deploring the harassment, and calling upon Kenyan
 authorities to enforce police discipline, Attorney General Muli
 released a formal statement maintaining that the matter had been
 thoroughly investigated and was without any foundation whatso-
 ever. This issue has not been mentioned since in any Kenyan
 publication.
 Kenyan Government sensitivity to criticism was also highlighted
 by its reaction to the mild disapprobation of Kenya's resort to
 detention voiced by a visiting British Parliamentarian in April
 1983. Kenyan Government officials denounced the Parliamen-
 tarian's remarks, the British High Commissioner was handed a
 formal Kenyan protest, and President Moi publicly chided the
 Member of Parliament for abusing Kenyan hospitality.
 The Government also discourages students and faculty from
 political activism. Three university lecturers formally de-
 tained prior to the August 1, 1982 coup attempt remain in
 custody. Kenya's institutions of higher education were closed
 immediately following the coup attempt and were fully reopened
 only on October 3, 1983. On the same day the Chief Inspector of
 Kenyan schools warned that the Ministry of Education would not
 condone literature which was not "relevant to national aspira-
 tion or which tended to mislead the common man."
 Kenya has a 30-member film censorship board (which was trans-
 ferred to the Ministry of Culture and Social Services in
 conjunction with the formation of the new Kenyan Government on
 October 1, following general elections). The board must approve
 all films shown in Kenya, but a wide variety of uncut foreign
 films is regularly available. A 10-member television censor-
 ship board has established precepts which govern what can
 be shown on television. This board recently removed an American
 television series from the airwaves, following allegations by
 senior Kenyan politicians that it violated public decency.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Although the Kenyan Constitution formally sanctions freedom
 of assembly and association, these rights are limited
 by the Public Order and Police Act, which gives local
 administrative authorities wide powers to control public
 gatherings. It is an offense to convene an unlicensed
 meeting, and politicians known to be at odds with central
 
 
 183
 authorities have been investigated for violations of this
 statute. Nonetheless, licenses for public meetings are only
 rarely denied, and then usually on the grounds that the proposed
 meeting might generate civil discder. The Government also can
 and occasionally has prevented political, religious, and social
 meetings under the Societies Act.
 Kenya has a relatively free trade union movement, but complex
 labor legislation renders almost all strikes illegal. Strikes
 are permitted only if the Ministry of Labor has not taken action
 within 21 days of the formal declaration of a dispute to have it
 resolved. Strikes are rare in Kenya because of these complex
 rules and because of Kenya's fragile economic condition. None-
 theless, in April and May 1983 many Kenyan power workers went
 on strike briefly to protest low wages and poor union represen-
 tation of workers' interests vis-a-vis management. The Govern-
 ment quickly imprisoned dozens of strikers for unlawful assembly
 and failure to observe the 21-day strike notice requirement.
 The strike was broken in a matter of days.
 In August 1980, the Government formally disbanded the Kenyan
 civil servants union (at that time Kenya's largest union)
 because of its alleged political activities. The Organization
 of African Trade Union Unity has continued to complain about
 the Government's unwillingness to permit a genuine civil
 servants' union despite Kenya's membership in the International
 Labor Organization and its signatory status to the convention
 guaranteeing freedom of association.
 All permament workers in private enterprise of at least seven
 persons may be organized into trade unions. Approximately
 three-quarters of all such enterprise employees are unionized,
 and about half (300,000) pay voluntary union dues. Unions
 actually represent a greater number in collective bargaining
 because non-union workers are covered by collective agreements
 negotiated for their enterprise. Agreements are usually
 of two years' duration. A few professional voluntary organiza-
 tions such as the Law Society of Kenya (i.e., the Kenyan Bar
 Association) exist, but such associations do not conduct
 themselves as trade unions.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 A wide degree of religious freedom exists in Kenya, and freedom
 of worship is written into the Constitution. No already regis-
 tered churches are persecuted by the Government. However, the
 Government can refuse to register any religious society or group
 which it believes may pursue activities harmful to public secur-
 ity. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (Mormons)
 has been trying without success to obtain registration under the
 Societies Act for the past three years.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel,
 Emigration, and Repatriation
 The Public Security Act provides for the legal restriction of
 movement within Kenya of persons determined to endanger public
 security. Between October 1982 and October 1983, Oginga Odinga,
 a leading politician known for his outspoken opposition to the
 
 30-231 0 - 84 - 13
 
 
 184
 central Government, was restricted (first to his city of
 residence, and then to his home) under this Act.
 Following the August 1, 1982 coup attempt, the Kenyan Government
 expanded bureaucratic requirements necessary for travel abroad.
 These additional hurdles have had a negative impact upon study
 and research opportunities abroad for Kenyan university students
 and faculty. Kenya does not, however, formally prohibit emi-
 gration of its nationals.
 Although Kenya suffers from high and increasing urban unemploy-
 ment, it continues to accept refugees. Kenya's refugee popula-
 tion has increased by approximately 45 percent over the past
 year to about 5,900 documented resident refugees. Of these,
 over 90 percent are either Ethiopian, Rwandan, or Ugandan. In
 addition to those individuals who have obtained official refugee
 status, between 2,000 and 10,000 additional persons have taken
 refuge in Kenya but are not legally classified as refugees by
 Kenyan authorities. The Kenyan Government continues to work
 with the Nairobi office of the United Nations High Commission
 for Refugees (UNHCR) in a businesslike and professional manner.
 On August 12, 1982, the Kenyan Government officially accredited
 an office of the Intergovernmental Committee for Migration (ICM)
 in Nairobi, and the local ICM representative was received by
 Kenya's Foreign Minister and welcomed to the country. Kenya
 respects the right of voluntary repatriation. The only known
 exception to Kenya's abiding by UNHCR guidelines and criteria
 regarding documented refugees occurred during the month of
 November 1983, when Kenya participated in two exchanges of
 political exiles with Tanzania. Some of the refugees involved
 in the exchanges had been accorded formal refugee status by the
 UNHCR. This fact had been considered by the Kenyan Government
 prior to the initial exchange, but political expediency was
 overriding.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to
 Change Their Government
 Kenya has been a de facto one-party state since 1969 and a
 de jure one-party state since the passage by the one-party
 legislature of a constitutional amendment on June 9, 1982. The
 move to adopt the constitutional amendment was led by Kenya's
 President Moi for purposes of blocking the formation of an
 opposition political party. Party membership is open to almost
 all and candidates covering a broad ideological spectrum compete
 for the party's nomination. As the party and the Government
 place no overt restriction on the ideology of candidates and
 only a plurality is required for election, the choices available
 to Kenyan voters under their one-party system are broad.
 Although limited to a slate of candidates approved by the party,
 there is a degree of genuine choice among individuals and
 policies. The number of candidates vying for a particular
 public office is frequently five, six, or more, and in the
 September 26 general elections up to 15 candidates ran for a
 single Parliamentary seat. Of the 995 persons who applied for
 party clearance to run for Parliament, 992 were permitted to
 stand. Of these, roughly 700 ultimately had their names placed
 on the ballot (various candidates failed to submit nomination
 papers, did not have funds to pay required nomination fees,
 
 
 185
 failed to pass English or Riswahili language examinations, or
 missed administrative deadlines).
 Incumbents are frequently voted out of office in Kenya. In
 Kenya's post-independence history as many as 60 percent of the
 country's sitting Parliamentarians have been defeated during a
 single election. On September 26, 1983, the Kenyan electorate
 rejected approximately 35 percent of Kenya's incumbent Parlia-
 mentarians, including five Ministers and 18 Assistant Ministers.
 It should be noted, however, that in Kenya's post-independence
 history neither the President nor the Vice President has ever
 faced an opposing candidate on election day; routinely they have
 been elected without opposition.
 Though municipal councillors are directly elected in Kenya,
 mayors are selected by the councillors from among their own
 number. Local elections took place simultaneously with national
 elections on September 26, 1983 in all Kenyan municipalities
 except Nairobi, where the city has been run by a government
 commission since March 1983, following the suspension of the
 entire city council after innumerable breakdowns in city ser-
 vices and widespread evidence of graft.
 Members of all ethnic groups are permitted to contest for
 office, and Kenya has one white Parliamentarian who was re-
 elected in a constituency that is 99 percent African, despite
 the presence of several African candidates on the ballot. Ten
 different tribes hold cabinet portfolios in the new Government,
 including the first ethnic Somali ever appointed to ministerial
 rank in Kenya. Almost 20 tribes are represented among the 43
 Assistant Ministers in the new government.
 Only one female candidate was elected to Kenya's National
 Assembly on September 26, 1983, although several contested.
 Moi subsequently appointed two women to Parliament as nominated
 Members (the Kenyan Constitution provides for 12 such presiden-
 tial appointments). In addition, over 20 female candidates were
 elected to municipal office.
 The Kenyan Government encourages but does not coerce the elec-
 torate to vote. Turnout has generally averaged between 60 and
 70 percent of the eligible electorate, but it fell to just 42
 percent on September 26.
 The range of permissible discussion of and opposition to govern-
 ment policies is fairly broad within the National Assembly, and
 split votes occasionally occur. Kenyan authorities, however,
 are not reluctant to delineate the range of acceptable conduct.
 Debates in the National Assembly have become increasingly
 focused on rural development issues, as the Government has
 become more concerned about Parliamentarians' criticism of
 national policies. The formal detention in August 1982 of
 dissident Koigi Wamwere, a sitting Member of Parliament who
 was openly and repeatedly critical of major government policies,
 exemplifies the kind of sanction the Government can employ
 against maverick politicians.
 
 
 186
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government of Kenya is sensitive to media and international
 criticism of human rights conditions. Various human rights
 organizations, including Amnesty International, have conducted
 extensive letter-writing campaigns to the Government with
 respect to Kenya's resort to the use of formal detention.
 Despite the October releases of five persons held under the
 Public Security Act, Government officials have emphatically
 rejected the notion that foreign pressure had anything to do
 with their decision. In October, 1983, President Moi specifi-
 cally and publicly castigated Amnesty International for 'meddl-
 ing' in Kenyan internal affairs.
 Though there are several Kenyan organizations which address
 certain aspects of human rights issues, there is no group which
 exclusively focuses on human rights concerns in Kenya. Kenya has
 neither signed nor ratified the Organization of African Unity
 human rights charter which was adopted at the organization's
 July 1981 summit'in Nairobi. In 1983, Amnesty International
 issued a statement of concern about the indefinite detention
 without trial of prisoners of conscience and the imprisonment of
 certain political opponents on charges of sedition. Freedom
 House rated Kenya a "partly free* society governed by a one-
 party nationalist state. Its further assertion that Kenya's
 largest tribal group has a preponderance of power is a reflec-
 tion of their dominant role in the past. The Kikuyu, the
 largest tribe in Kenya, having 21 percent of the population, has
 been rapidly losing political power to the minority tribes. The
 President himself is a member of the minority Kalenjin tribe.
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 The Kenyan Government has made strong efforts to improve the
 country's health care, education, and standard of living, but
 recent economic difficulties have retarded progress in these
 areas. Real per capita growth of gross domestic product has
 been virtually stagnant over the last seven years. Kenya's
 economic problems are exacerbated by an annual population growth
 rate of 4.1 percent. This figure appears inflated. The Kenyan
 Government figure of 3.8 may be more accurate. Even at this
 lower level, however, Kenya has one of the highest rates of
 growth in the world. Annual per capita gross national product
 is estimated by the World Bank as approximately $432.
 All wage and salary earners are covered by minimum wage provi-
 sions of the Employment Act. Separate minimum wages exist for
 agriculture, the Nairobi and Mombasa metropolitan areas, other
 urban areas, and all other fields of employment. These rates
 were raised in August 1982 to compensate partially for infla-
 tion. About one-quarter of Kenya's regular wage earner labor
 force works in agriculture, the field paying the lowest wages.
 Approximately 85 percent of Kenya's 18.6 million persons live in
 rural areas, and about half of them are estimated to live below
 the poverty level. Western and Nyanza provinces contain the
 largest numbers of the rural destitute population, including
 among their number small farmers, pastoralists, the landless,
 and large farm squatters.
 
 
 187
 All Kenyan wage earners are subject to government regulations
 stipulating that wage increases may not exceed three-quarters
 of the increase in the cost of living since the signing of the
 previous wage agreement. Despite this obstacle, some unions
 have had notable success in obtaining salary adjustments for
 union members by filing litigation before the industrial court.
 Some unions have also obtained significant additional worker
 benefits, such as expanded health insurance coverage and in-
 creased housing allowances. All collective agreements must be
 approved by the industrial court before they can take effect.
 Women constitute an essential factor in Kenya's labor equation.
 They still provide about three-fourths of Kenya's farm labor
 while carrying out their traditional familial responsibilities.
 Because of an accelerating rural out-migration of males to the
 cities in search of difficult-to-find but higher paying jobs,
 female farm labor will maintain its prominent position.
 Several of Kenya's better known tribes still practice female
 circumcision, but this harsh ritual has been declining. The
 Kenyan Government has made a major effort to eliminate the
 practice. President Moi has publicly and repeatedly condemned
 female circumcision, and the Ministry of Health has ordered that
 such operations not be performed in government facilities.
 The considerable progress which Kenya made in health care in the
 early independence period has slowed in recent years. Though
 life expectancy rose from 42.5 years in 1960 to 55.7 by 1978,
 life expectancy has now dropped slightly to 54.9 years. A
 similar levelling has emerged in infant mortality rates: In
 1960 the rate was 150 per 1,000 live births, a figure which
 dropped to 83 by 1977 and currently stands at 71.
 Although the most recent data available (1975) indicate that
 virtually all city dwellers have access to clean water, data on
 Kenya's rural population are a mirror image: only 4 percent of
 Kenya's rural population have regular access to safe water.
 Recent data (1977) on caloric consumption indicate that about 96
 percent of Kenya's minimal nutritional requirements are met.
 Primary and secondary education are strongly encouraged in
 Kenya. The primary school enrollment ratio is 99 percent
 (1978), but secondary school enrollment rates drop sharply:
 of all males between 15 and 19, only 25 percent are enrolled
 in secondary school; only 15 percent of the comparable female
 population are similarly enrolled. Only 2 percent of Kenya's
 college age population are enrolled in institutions of higher
 education, and of these students only 2 percent are female.
