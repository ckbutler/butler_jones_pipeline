 SPAIN
 Spain is a democracy with a constitutional monarch. The Parliament consists of
 two chambers, the Congress of Deputies and the Senate. Prime Minister Felipe Gon-
 zalez was elected to a fourth term in 1993, albeit as head of a minority government.
 The Socialist-run Government has agreed to hold elections in March 1996, one year
 short of its mandated term of office. The Government respects the constitutional
 provisions for an independent judiciary in practice.
 Spain has three levels of security forces. The National Police are responsible for
 nationwide investigations, security in urban areas, traffic control, and hostage res-
 cue. The Civil Guard polices rural areas and controls borders and highways. Autono-
 mous police forces have taken over much of the duties of the Civil Guard in Galicia,
 Catalonia, and the Basque country. The security forces are under the effective con-
 trol of the Government; allegations of human rights abuses are investigated, and
 those found guilty are punished. The security services also maintain governmental
 anticorruption units. There is a Special Advisor for Human Rights in the Ministry
 of Justice and Interior, charged with promoting humanitarian law and providing
 human rights training to senior law enforcement personnel. Some members of the
 security forces committed human rights abuses.
 The economy is market-based, with primary reliance on private enterprise, al-
 though a number of public-sector enterprises remain in key areas. Growth was 1.7
 percent in 1994 and nearly 3 percent in 1995. Citizens enjoy an advanced standard
 of living. While the unemployment rate improved, at yeas end it remained well
 over 20 percent. Actual unemployment is lower due to the extensive underground
 economy. Nonetheless, the rate is problematically high. The main causes are labor
 laws that tend to impede job creation and social welfare programs that reduce the
 incentive to work. Parliament enacted a labor reform package in 1994, but its long-
 term effects on unemployment have not yet been fully felt.
 The Government generally respected the human rights of its citizens. However,
 there were problems in some areas, including beatings by police, an inefficient judi-
 cial system, recent revelations of past government surveillance of private phone
 calls, discrimination against Roma, and increasing incidences of racism and right-
 wing, youth-related violence. The Government is taking important steps to deal with
 violence against women.
 The principal source of human rights abuses continued to be the protracted terror-
 ism campaign waged by the Basque Fatherland and Freedom (ETA) separatist
 group, which committed killings, kidnapings, and other abuses. The Government's
 efforts to bring terrorists to justice were marred by continued detainee accusations
 of mistreatment and recent allegations that the Government was behind the
 "Antiterrorist Liberation Group" (GAL) which was responsible for bombings,
 kidnapings, and 26 extrajudicial killings during the early 1980's. The Supreme
 Court was still investigating GAL at year's end. In September 1993, two suspected
 ETA collaborators died while in police custody; the Government has not yet released
 the results of its investigation. The remains of two suspected ETA members missing
 since 1983 were identified in March; investigators allege a government role in their
 abduction, torture and execution, and the courts are deciding if the Civil Guard and
 the Ministry of Justice and Interior have been involved in covering up some of the
 facts in the case. In October a German court refused to extradite a suspected ETA
 terrorist because of suspicions that he might be mistreated.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political or
 other extrajudicial killings by government forces in 1995, but in March a special po-
 lice investigative team identified two partially burned and decomposed bodies as be-
 longing to two suspected ETA members who were previously listed as missing since
 1983. Authorities are investigating allegations that the police illegally abducted the
 two in France, then torture and executed them. Separate litigation is under way
 
 
 1033
 regarding alleged Civil Guard and Ministry of Justice and Interior perjury and ob-
 struction of justice after the bodies were found.
 In August new evidence and testimony relating to the previous case led to the re-
 opening of another 10-year-old case involving the death in police custody of a young
 setran conductor, Mikel Zabaza, whom authorities took from his home for al-
 leged collaboration with terrorists. According to police testimony, Zabalza escaped-
 while still handuffed-from three Civil Guardsmen. His body was found in a river
 20 days later. Investigators now suspect Zabaza might have drowned from having
 his head dunked underwater during interrogation. Litigation is still pending.
 There were no new developments in the September 1993 incident in which two
 other suspected ETA collaborators died while in police custody. The matter is still
 under investigation.
 In September former Director of State Security Julian San Cristobal testified
 under oath to a Supreme Court investigating judge that the so-called Antiterrorist
 Liberation Group (GAL), which targeted Basque separatists and was responsible for
 bombings, kidnapings and at least 26 extrajudiciaI killings, never actually existed;
 GAL-attributed activities were actually state-sponsored covert operations. Other
 former high-ranking security officials continue to give similar testimony, although
 differing on bow hig up the chain of command the covert activities were mandated.
 Most observers expect the judicial hearings on GAL to take months.
 There continued to be frequent terrorist incidents. Thirty-six attacks were attrib-
 uted to ETA in 1995, resulting in 17 deaths and 5 serious injuries. Actions by ETA
 and its affiliated groups caused millions of dollars worth of damage throughout
 Spain. Authorities say that the number of ETA-related violent acts in 1995 was
 three times the level carried out between 1990 and 1994.
 Notably in 1995, ETA expanded its targets to include journalists and the Basque
 autonomous police force and launched a concentrated attack on political parties.
 Fifty separate attacks on various party headquarters were reported through August.
 In January ETA murdered the deputy mayor of San Sebastian (who was also the
 center- lit Popular Party's (PP) provincial president). Not since 1984 had an elect-
 ed official been the victim of an ETA attack. In April Jose Maria Aznar PP Presi-
 dent and principal opposition leader, narrowly escaped death in an explosion that
 blew up his car and wounded his bodyguards. In August police arrested a group of
 ETA terrorists who planned to assassinate King Juan Carlos. On December 29,po-
 lice arrested a ring of ETA terrorists who planned to kill Basque politicians.  A
 also stepped up attacks on non-security personnel: during the summer months, 9
 bombs explode at tourist locations, and 15 bombs were planted on roadways or rail-
 ways.
 b. Disappearance.-Basque industrialist Jose Maria Aldaia Etxeburu was kid-
 naped May 9 by ETA terrorists, who claimed responsibility for the act on May 25.
 The 53-year-old victim's whereabouts remain unknown. On June 27, the long-dor-
 mant Communist terrorist group "Grapo" kidnaped businessman Publio Cordon.
 Suspects arrested in October claim that he was released after payment of ransom,
 but he has not reemerged since his disappearance. (The Government forbids the
 payment of ransom by families of kidnap victims, and in some cases it has frozen
 the victim's family's assets.)
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The law prohibits such acts. Spain is a signatory to the U.N. Convention against
 Torture and in March approved Protocol 1 of the 1993 Strasbourg European Con-
 vention for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Pen-
 alties. Nonetheless, there were instances of police beatings of racial and ethnic mi-
 norities (see Section 5). Human rights groups filed numerous complaints of torture
 and degrading treatment against the military as well. Detainees charged with ter-
 rorism invariably assert they have been abused during detention, and other detain-
 ees sometimes make similar charges. In 1994 over 100 security force members were
 found guilty of committing such abuses. In June the U.N. Committee Against Tor-
 ture rejected a complaint filed on behalf of a French national imprisoned in Spain
 for ETA-related activities. The Committee ruled that the Government took seriously
 the allegations of mistreatment, investigated them, and determined them to be un-
 founded.
 According to the Association of Families of ETA Prisoners (Senideak), the 11 com-
 plaints of mistreatment that it lodged with authorities in 1994 is significantly down
 from similar complaints in past years (for example, 80 in 1993). The Secretary of
 State for Penal Affairs credits improvements in the way prisoners are transferred
 among prisons as being a significant factor in the decline of complaints. In February
 his ofice brought three cases recommended by Senideak to the courts.
 While the stuation of ETA prisoners appears to be improving, individuals, non-
 governmental organizations (NGO's), and the media continue to accuse the Civil
 
 
 1034
 Guard of unprovoked brutality, particularly in the Basque region. According to the
 Spanish Association Against Torture's annual report, there were 267 accusations of
 torture in 1994 (latest data available), involving 448 members of the security forces,
 of whom 128 were found guilty and sentenced, and 120 were found innocent. The
 rest are still being processed. Key cases reaching the courts in 1995 included 14
 Civil Guards being processed for mistreating an arrestee in Madrid and 8 Basque
 police officers charged with abusing 4 suspected terrorists.
 A paper released in February by, the U . Center for Human Rights in Geneva
 indicated that 21 Spaniards, the majority of them Basques, fled claims of torture
 or degrading treatment with that office in 1994. The Government's position is that
 the complaints are false, and that any of the signs of abuse the plaintiffs might
 show could be the result of resisting arrest. The Government also contends that doc-
 tors assigued by the courts examined 15 of the alleged victims, all arrested over a
 3-month priod in Guipuoa, in the Baque ountry, and found no evidence of
 abuse. Nonetheless, the Government has looked into two of the cases, one involving
 proceedings against eight Basque regional police officers (Ertzaintza) in the case of
 an August 1994 arrestee who died from the over-inhalation of the gas used by police
 to defend themselves.
 In December a national court admitted "the possible existence of torture" as it
 sentenced 11 terrorists. It is unusual for a court to open up an appeal for torture
 at the time of sentencing, but the judge in the case noted "abundant evidence, all
 detailed, given not only by the accused but by other witnesses in the case."
 In October a German court refused to extradite a presumed ETA terrorist on the
 grounds that there were not sufficient guarantees that Spanish authorities would
 respect his human rights. The court also did not believe that he would receive ade-
 quate medical attention while in custody (he has AIDS). In December the German
 Supreme Court ruled in favor of Spain, but the suspect's lawyers are appealing the
 case to the Constitutional Court.
 Human rights groups and members of the press complain that accused human
 rights offenders have avoided penalization by prolonging the appeals process and
 that sentences for convicted abusers are unduly light. Both kinds of complaints are
 borne out by individual rulings. In March the Council of Ministers pardoned two of
 five civil guards whose convictions were upheld in September 1994 for torturing a
 Basque prisoner held incommunicado in 1983. The two have since been promoted.
 One of them had previously been pardoned in 1991 after having been convicted of
 torturing a local politician in 1983. The other one was not forced to resign from the
 police force until June; he had previous convictions for robbery with violence, posses-
 sion of illegal weapons, and bribery. Six of nine Civil Guard members convicted in
 1990 for torturing a suspect in 1980 were not finally expelled from the force until
 May. According to Amnesty International, those convicted of rights abuses cus-
 tomarily do not serve sentences of less than I year and 1 day.
 Prison conditions generally meet minimum international standards, and the Gov-
 ernment permits visits by human rights monitors. In November 1994, a court con-
 victed 12 officials of the model prison in Barcelona for applying "unnecessary sever-
 ity" and causing injuries to 17 prisoners relating to a 1990 incident. Two were sus-
 pended for 4 years and the others for 3 years. They are appealing the verdict. Simi-
 lar proceedings are under way against six guards at the model prison in Valencia.
 The guards are charged with 38 separate counts of torture, carrying a possible sen-
 tence of more than 10 years, for actions relating to a disturbance in 1992.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution and law prohibits arbi-
 trary arrest, detention, or exile, and the Government observes these prohibitions. A
 suspect normally may not be held more than 72 hours without a hearing. The Penal
 Code permits holding a suspected terrorist an additional 2 days without a hearing.
 The law on aliens permits detention of a person for up to 40 days prior to deporta-
 tion, but specifies that it must not take place in a prison-like setting.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution provides for an independent judi-
 ciary, and the judiciary is independent in practice. The judicial structure comprises
 territorial, provincial, regional, and municipal courts with the Supreme Court at its
 apex. A Constitutional Court protects constitutional rights, but there is no clear dis-
 tinction between its jurisdiction and that of the Supreme Court on some issues, nor
 is it clear which has ultimate authority. The European Court of Human Rights is
 the final arbiter in cases concerning human rights.
 The Constitution provides for the right to a fair public trial, and the authorities
 respect this right in practice. Defendants have the right to be represented by an at-
 torney (at public expense for the indigent). They are released on bail unless the
 court has reason to believe that the suspect may flee or be a threat to public safety.
 The law calls for an expeditious judicial hearing following arrest. Suspects may not
 be confined for more than 2 years before being brought to trial, unless a judge an-
 
 
 1035
 thorizes further delay; he may extend pretrial custody to 4 years. In practice, pre-
 trial custody generally is less than 1 year. However, increasing criticism is heard
 in legal circles that some judges abuse preventive custody as a kind of anticipatory
 sentencing or as a means of eliciting testimony from uncooperative witnesses. In
 cases of petty crime, suspects released on bail sometimes wait as long as 5 years
 for trial. In September 25.8 percent of the prison population was in jail awaiting
 trial. Following conviction, defendants may appeal to the next higher court.
 Courts released over two dozen persons suspected of serious crimes from preven-
 tive custody during the year because they reached the maximum time of incarcer-
 ation without a trial allowed by law. The Association of Victims of Terrorism and
 various police organs have protested the delays endemic in the present judicial proc-
 ess.
 A severe backlog of pending cases--n September there were some 38,000 of all
 kinds (not only human rights)-and an acute shortage of judges have prompted calls
 to overhaul the judicial system. In July Congress approved an ambitious project to
 revamp the entire Penal Code. Many describe this as the most ambitious legislative
 project since the framing of the Constitution; the Government scheduled completion
 of the project for 1996. Fulfilling a constitutional mandate, Congress voted in June
 to inaugurate a 9-person jury to preside over selected cases. In September can-
 didates for jury duty were selected from census rolls for trials expected to be held
 by 1997.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution provides for the privacy of the home and correspondence. Under the
 Criminal Code, government authorities must obtain court approval before searching
 private property, wiretapping, or interfering with private correspondence. The
 present antiterrorist law gives discretionary authority to the Minister of Justice and
 Interior to act prior to obtaining court approval "in cases of emergency." There were
 no complaints that the Minister abused this authority.
 In June the press published allegedly leaked official documents suggesting that
 the National Intelligence Agency (CESID) intercepted and recorded telephone con-
 versations between 1984 and 1991. Private calls made by the King, various min-
 isters, and other prominent figures were apparently taped and stored at CESID.
 The scandal resulted in the resignation of CESID's director, the Minister of Defense,
 and the Vice President. Investigation and litigation concerning the matter contin-
 ues.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech
 and the press, and the Government respects these rights in practice. Opposition
 viewpoints, both from political parties and other organizations, are freely aired and
 are widely reflected in the media. Academic freedom is respected.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 these rights, and the Government respects them in practice.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the
 Government respects this right in practice. Roman Catholicism is the predominant
 religion, and its institutions receive official funding. Protestant and Jewish leaders
 have refused the Government's offer of financial support.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Constitution and laws provide for these rights, and the Govern-
 ment respects them in practice.
 The new asylum law, passed in 1994 but suspended in September that same year
 pending a hearing on its constitutionality, was reinstated with modifications in Feb-
 ruary. The law brings refugee and asylum cases together and gives full power to
 the Office of Asylum and Refugees (OAR-a branch of the Ministry of Justice and
 Interior) to adjudicate them, but also mandates that cases can be referred to the
 U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees for appeal. Asylum requests can be made only
 at the port of entry, and applicants stay in detention until the case is resolved. Neg-
 ative rulings must be returned within 72 hours, but the asylum seeker has an addi-
 tional 24 hours in which to make an appeal. No provisions are made for detainees
 to have access to translators or lawyers. In 1994, of the 12,812 requests for asylum,
 the Government admitted 627. In the first 9 months of 1995, the OAR reported that
 only 286 asylum petitions were filed, and it granted 158, or 55 percent. Most of
 those denied were found to be economic, not political, refugees.
 
 
 1036
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Spain is a multiparty democracy with open elections in which all citizens 18 years
 of age and over have the right to vote by secret ballot for Parliament, regional, pro-
 vincial, and local bodies. At all levels of government, elections are held at least
 every 4 years.
 Governmental power is shared between the central Government and 17 regional
 "Autonomous Communities." Local nationalist parties give political expression to re-
 gional linguistic and cultural identities; their influence at the national level has
 been increased by the Government's minority position in Parliament. In the Basque
 country, nationalist parties provide a legitimate democratic alternative to separatist
 groups that advocate achieving independence through terrorist violence. Sporadic
 examples of political violence perpetrated by extreme nationalist fringe groups oc-
 curred during the year. In April a mayoral candidate from a center-right party for
 a town in Catalonia was threatened with death, had his motorcycle burned on his
 front porch, and had his office attacked with stones to prevent him from campaign-
 ing. In the Basque country, violent protesters occupied several town halls following
 local election results that they thought were unfavorable.
 Women are increasing their participation in the political process. The number of
 female candidates increased in the 1993 national elections. However, under the elec-
 toral system, the percentage of votes won determines the number of candidates
 elected from the party list; because parties place many women in the lower half of
 the list, the number elected has never reached 25 percent of the total. In Congress,
 54 of 350 deputies are women, while in the Senate women number 32 of 256 mem-
 bers. There are three female ministers. Most political parties have within their char-
 ters mandates for at least a 25-percent quota for women to partici ate in all party
 political endeavors. However, few parties currently live up to this i eal. In the May
 28 regional and municipal elections, 29 percent of the center-right Popular Party's
 mayoral candidates and 24 percent of its candidates for regional parliaments were
 women.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 A number of nongovernmental human rights groups, including the Human Rights
 Association of Spain, in Madrid, and the Human Rights Institute of Catalonia, in
 Barcelona, operate freely without government interference. The Government cooper-
 ates readily with international organizations investigating allegations of human
 rights abuses (such as the European Commission of Human Rights) and inter-
 national nongovernmental human rights groups, as well as with independent na-
 tional groups.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution provides for equal rights for all citizens and provides for a na-
 tional Ombudsman, called the "people's defender," who actively investigates com-
 plaints of human rights abuses by the authorities. The Ombudsman operates inde-
 pendently from any party or government ministry, must be elected every 5 years
 by a three-fifths majority of Congress, and is immune from prosecution. He has com-
 plete access to government institutions and documents not classified secret for rea-
 sons of national security. His 1994 annual report, released in March, listed 18,594
 complaints of all kinds. While the majority of cases pertained to education and so-
 cial services, there was an increase in complaints of racism, as well as in cases of
 mistreatment by security forces.
 Women.-Sexual abuse, violence, and harassment in the workplace continued to
 be areas of great concern. According to the nongovernmental (but largely govern-
 ment-funded) Commission for Investigation of Mistreatment of Women, 86 women
 were killed by male partners in 1994. The police received 16,000 complaints of abuse
 in 1994 (the latest figures available); however, experts believe that only 10 percent
 of violent acts against women each year are reported to authorities, owing in part
 to the unsympathetic attitudes of some police and judicial personnel. A 1989 law
 prohibits harassment in the workplace, but very few cases have been brought to
 trial under this law.
 Several levels of government provide assistance to battered women. A toll-free hot
 line advises women where to go for government shelter or other aid if mistreated.
 The Government also runs educational programs seeking to change public attitudes
 that contribute to violence against women. The Women's Institute has charged that
 some judges are reluctant to get involved in cases of violence against a woman by
 a member of her family.
 
 
 1037
 Similarly, in smaller towns some police officers have been reluctant to accept com-
 plaints from battered women. Reognizng the latter problem, the Nationa Police
 have special sections to deal with violence against women, staffed by specially
 trained- women officers. According to a report from the Secretary of State for the
 Interior, 1,603 rapes were reported in 1994, 2 percent mere than the year before.
 The report attributes the increase to mere reporting due to better treatment of vic-
 tsby the poice's special servies sections. Some rape cases in 1995 were decided
 on the degree of the victim's physical resistance, or Whether the rapist succeeded
 invaginal penetration.
 In recent years women, who make up 51 percent of the population, have moved
 towards equality under the law and entered the educational system and work force
 in larger numbers: slightly mere women than men now have college degrees and
 women outnumber men in the legal, journalism, and health care professions. 6row-
 ing numbers of women occupy senior governmental positions, among them the Min-
 isters of Social Affairs, Health, and Culture. Women make up about 30 percent of
 judges (a profession that was closed to women before 1977). In December the Con-
 stitutional Court ruled that the Constitution outlaws discrimination based on sex
 in all endeavors. Nonetheless, traditional attitudes continue to impose de facto dis-
 crimination. This varies considerably among the regions. In September inspectors
 from the Ministry of Labor fined a hospital in Bilbao for requiring its female nurses
 to wear skirts instead of pants while at work.
 The law mandates equal pay for equal work. In October the Constitutional Court
 ruled in favor of 25 women at a Basque latex factory whose union complained that
 they had been unjustly compensated. The factory justified paying men more because
 they "work harder," lift mere, and were more apt to work late hours. The Court
 ruled that work done by men and women, though different, was of equal value.
 However, according to a report by the Government's Economic and Social Council,
 for the first quarter of 1995 the median salary for women was 28 percent less than
 for men (the Ministry for Social Affairs puts the number at 20 percent for 1994).
 The same report says that women are more likely to have temporary contracts and
 part-time employment than men.
 Although one-third more women (mainly those under age 30) work outside the
 home than a decade ago, women make up only a third of the total work force. The
 Government tried to instigate private sector incentives to diversify the workforce,
 but in October the European Union Justice Tribunal in Luxembourg ruled that
 quotas favoring women were discriminatory and illegal. According to Ministry of
 Labor data, the unemployment rate for women is almost double that for men. The
 National Association of Rural Women and Families testified before the Senate in
 May that although 80 percent of rural women are not formally employed, they aid
 their husbands in farming or fishing. They do not receive the same social security
 benefits as the male head of household since they lack titles to the family enter-
 prise.
 Children.-The Government demonstrates its commitment to children's welfare
 through well-funded and easily accessed programs of education and health care. The
 Constitution obligates both the State and parents to protect children, whether or not
 born in wedlock. 7he Ministries of Health and Social Affairs are responsible for the
 welfare of children and have created a number of programs to aid needy children.
 Numerous NGO's exist to further children's rights. For example, the School Help
 Program for the Protection of Children operates a team of experts who work with
 educators to help them identify abused or abandoned children in the classroom. In
 Madrid alone, 425 schools participated in the program, and the group helped iden-
 tify 1,050 cases of abuse in 1994.
 Under the new Penal Code, children under the age of 18 are not considered re-
 sponsile for their acts and so cannot be sent to prison. A 1987 signatory to the
 1961 Hague Convention, Spain voted in March to withdraw reservations it had held
 previous-y in regrd to the protection of minors; the treaty's provisions will now
 apply to all children in Spain, not just those who are Spanish citizens. The Law of
 the Child bill passed yCongss in April gives legarights of testimony for minors
 in child abuse cases; it also will oblige all citizens to act on cases of suspected child
 abuse and, for the first time, sets up rules regarding foreign adoptions.
 The law permits children of mothers who are incarcerated to reside in prison with
 the mother until age 6; a resolution passed by the Senate recommends that the age
 be reduced. As of September, 221 chidren lived injails.
 People With Disabilities.-The Constitution obligcs the State to provide for the
 adequate treatment and care of people with disabilities and to ensure that they are
 not deprived of the basic rights which apply to all citizens. A law on the integration
 of disabled citizens aims to ensure fair access to public employent, prevent dis-
 crimination, and facilitate physical accessibility to public facilities and transpor-
 
 
 1038
 tation. However, such accessibility has not yet improved much in many areas. In
 1993 the autonomous community in Madridpassed local legislation requiring all
 new construction to be adapted to the needs of the disabled. In May the Parliament
 enacted a similar but more broadly defined law. In June the Senate voted to rec-
 ommend that the Government adopt "the necessary means to better integrate the
 deaf into society" but did not include specific points of action.
 The 1989 Penal Code allows parents or legal representatives of a mentally dis-
 abled person to petition a judge to obtain permission for the sterilization of that per-
 son, and many courts have authorized such surgery. In July 1994 the Constitutional
 Court held that sterilization of the mentally infirm does not constitute a violation
 of the Constitution. Religious groups continue to contest this ruling.
 NationallRacial/Ethnic Minoritie&-Roma, constituting about 3 percent of the
 population, continue to suffer de facto discrimination in housing schools and jobs.
 Acensus published by the private polling firm Cires in June showed R'oma to be
 among the least socially valued groups, above "drug addicts" but below "immi-
 grants." A university studyreleased in Dctober indicates that while racism is on the
 increase in general, anti-Rma sentiments by students tripled between 1986 and
 1993. Legal mechanisms exist by which Roma may seek redress of discrimination,
 and the Government has stated its commitment to secure equal rights and treat-
 ment for them.
 On January 25, the Constitutional Court denied the appeal of the ex-mayor of
 Mancha Real and 17 others convicted of inciting or participating in a riot that led
 to the destruction of a Romani community in May 1991. In a relatd case, a lower
 court ordered 19 Mancha Real citizens to pay damages of $3,252 (Ptas 400,000) to
 four Remani children whom they taunted and harassed with racial epithets while
 the children traveled to and from school.
 Since 1991 the Madrid city government, in cooperation with the autonomous re-
 gional government, has been carrying out a program to relocate squatters--the
 cat majority of whom are Rema-to housing projects in the region. Spain's largest
 Romani organization, Gypsy Presence, protests the relocation and complains that
 the city has put up fences and police checkpoints that make Romani communities
 resemble prison camps. The group's complaint that such relocation areas lack basic
 services is supported by N   and the press. The city government denies any anti-
 Romani bias in its actions. The University of Navarra estimates that 12,000 people
 live in camps on the outskirts of Madrid ("Chabolistas"), although the Madrid public
 works councillor complained in September that there has never been a reliable cen-
 sus of Chabolistas.
 Six of the 17 autonomous communities use a language or dialect other than Cas-
 tilian Spanish. The Constitution stipulates that citizens have "the duty to know"
 Castilian, which is the "official language of state," but it adds that other languages
 can also be official under regional statutes, and that "the different language vari-
 ations of Spain are a cultural heritage which shall be... protected." Catalonia has
 passed a law whereby Catalan is to be taught in the region's schools and is to be
 used for official regional functions. In December 1994, the Constitutional Court
 ruled against a challenge to this law, in a case brought by several Castilian Span-
 ish-speakers in Catalonia who claimed to be discriminated against in education and
 employment. Suits regarding specific applications of this law are still pending in
 various courts. The regional parliaments of Galicia and Valencia are currently de-
 bating whether to institute language laws similar to Catalonia's.
 In April Parliament modified the Penal Code to make it a crime to "incite, pub-
 licize, or otherwise promote the abuse or discrimination of people or groups because
 of race, ethnicity nationality, ideology, or religious beliefs.* No cases have yet been
 tried under this law, and human rights groups and the media continued to give in-
 creasing attention to the human rights of the growing numbers of illegal immigrants
 from northern and sub-Saharan Africa. The Association of Moroccan Immigrant La-
 borers has offices in Madrid, Barcelona, and Seville to combat anti-Moroccan racism,
 and Madrid city government in December created a special administrative office to
 air immigrant complaints.
 Only 1.3 percent of the total population is foreign-born. Nonetheless, a February
 study by the Institute of Economic Studies suggested that the local job market could
 not absorb any more immigrants and that the rate of immigration should be dras-
 tically reduced. A June Cires poll indicated that 26 percent of Spaniards (double
 that of the year before) think that "there are too many people from other nationali-
 ties who live in Spain." The government census body (a) released a study in
 March for the European Consultative Commission on Racism and Xenophobia that
 indicated slightly higher numbers for Spaniards who think that the present rate of
 immigration is "too much" and showed that 53.2 percent of Spaniards "never had
 any kind of interaction7 with immigrants. Minister of Social Services Cristina

 Alberdi, who issued the report, claimed that the numbers suggested that there was
 less racism in Spain than ever before and said that Spaniard-are "very liberal and
 tolerant" and are "the least racist of Europe. Nonetheless, race-related incidents
 have increasingly been reported in the press.
 The media regularly reported alleged police mistreatment of northern and sub-Sa-
 haran Africans, particularly Moroccans, still commonly called "Moors" by many
 Spaniards. In September 1991 in Ibiza, a Civil Guard patrol, aided by municipal po-
 lice, stopped and questioned two Danish-passport carrying Muslim tourists. Authori-
 ties claim that the two then became violent. Nonetheless, police kept them hand-
 cuffed and continued beating them at the police station. After a month-long inquiry,
 the public prosecutor decided to postpone the case filed by the two complainants.
 Meanwhile, the pair were charged with resisting arrest and causing injury. In July
 1993, they were found guilty ofresisting arrest and sentenced to a month and a day
 in jail. It was not untilV~a  that the ourt onvited the five accused security offi-
 cers of "mistreatment" and "causing physical and mental damage." The victims re-
 ceived an indemnity of $4 066 (Ptas 500,000). The police were required to pa the
 medical and court osts of~ the victims and face a jail sentence "of up to 30 days.
 In June 1994, a Reuter photographer who happened to be passing by photo-
 graphed Zahzouh Mohammed, an Algerian legal resident of Spain, being beaten by
 police. The photos proved to be the only evidence in the Algerian's favor when a
 hearing of the case occurred a year later police cited the two witnesses who
 cosigned Mohammed's complaint for resisting arrest and had them deported. Three
 other witnesses have left the country, and another cannot be located.
 In March two illegal immigrant women from Morocco and Brazil claimed that
 they were sexually assaulted by the same guard at an internment center in Malaga,
 where they were   ing held prior to their deportation. The guard did not deny the
 acts, but claimed that they were consensual. Two other guards have been implicated
 in abuse and mistreatment. A legal investigation is underway, but the plaintiffs
 meanwhile have been deported. Two Latin American women complained of sexual
 assault while being held at the Madrid airport at the end of January. The Ombuds-
 man had received similar complaints in 1994, and an investigation is underway. The
 accused spent 2 days in custody and has been released pending trial.
 In June a black Dominican was at an open air bar with his white female compan-
 ion when police arrested him, allegedly responding to a complaint that he had wen
 beating her. The woman denied that there had been any problem; the Dominican
 reportedly resisted arrest, was beaten by the officers, handcuffed, and taken to the
 police station where he sustained more beatings that required hospitalization. Two
 officers were charged with abuse, released on $8,130 (Ptas 1 million) bail, and al-
 lowed to report back to work. Their case is still pending. Police served the Domini-
 can with deportation papers 36 hours after he filed his complaint.
 A March CIS poll indicated that "North Americans" are among the "least valued"
 ethnic groups in Spain, above "Moroccans' but below "Asians" and "black Africans."
 US. citizens regularly complain of discrimination and abuse by authorities and,
 more frequently, by ordinary citizens. Women, African-Americans, and US. citizens
 of Latin American origin are those most frequently victimized. The worst case oc-
 curred in May when a black American dance choreographer was badly beaten, seri-
 ously damaging his hand, by five youths in a Madrid metro station because of his
 skin color.
 There are consistent complaints that when tourists report thefts or assaults to
 local police, the crimes are often shrugged off as being perpetrated by non-Span-
 iards. An extreme example of this occurred in June when a native Spanish-seaking
 US. citizen reported to the police a robbery involving a rental car near Madrid's
 international airport. The investigating officer told the man that the incident was
 an isolated occurrence and that he was probably robbed by "(his) own countrymen-
 Sudacos (a disparaging term used for Latinos). When the victim protested that the
 man who robbed him spoke with a Spanish (Castillian) accent, the policeman wrote
 on the official report: 'thief spoke Spanish, with an accent.
 Quasi-organized rightwing youth gangs, called "skinheads" by the local press, con-
 tinued to  ommit violent attacks tugout the year, terrorizing minorities, as-
 saulting law enforcement officers, and in some instances, committing murder. At
 least four street battles, involving dozens of youth and police, occurred in 1995. A
 government minister told Congress in November that skinhead violence had in-
 creased 20 percent over the previous year. A Ministry of Justice and Interior report
 in September ndicated that 37 percent of cities with over 25,000 inhabitants re-
 ported skinhead activities in 1995. Barcelona led the list with 78 percent of the re-
 ported incidents, followed by Madrid and Valencia. National police believe the skin-
 head population to be 2,331 nationwide and have made 166 arrests this year. Jus-
 tic and Interior Minister Juan Alberto Belch said in October that racist youth vi-

 olence "is not very serious in quantitative terms, but this rash of violence is indeed
 dangerous."
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-All workers, except those in the military services,
 judges, magistrates, and prosecutors are entitled to form or join unions of their own
 choosing. All that is required to organize a union is that more than two workers
 register with the Ministry of Labor and Social Security. Spain has over 200 reg-
 istered trade unions, but one is not legally registered. The Constitutional Court
 ruled in 1986 that it was ineligible, since it represents military personnel barred
 from unionization by the Constitution.
 Under the Constitution, trade unions are free to choose their representatives, de-
 termine their policies, represent their members' interests, and strike. They are not
 restricted or harassed by the Government and are independent of political parties.
 A strike in nonessential fields is legal if its sponsors give 5-days' notice. Any strik-
 ing union must respect minimum-service requirements negotiated with the respec-
 tive employer. The Constitutional Court has interpreted the right to strike to in-
 clude general strikes called to protest government policy. Strikes occur frequently,
 but most are brief. Data for 1995 show an increase in strike activity, presumably
 reflecting a new determination by the unions to offer and accept fewer concessions
 while the Government is trying to restructure several large industries, such as steel
 and shipbuilding.
 Unions are free to form or join federations and affiliate with international bodies
 and do so without hindrance.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-A 1980 statute undergirds the
 right to organize and bargain collectively. Trade union and collective bargaining
 rights were extended in 1986 to all workers in the public sector, except the military
 services. Public sector collective bargaining in 1990 was broadened to include sala-
 ries and employment levels, but the Government retained the right to set these if
 negotiations failed. Collective bargaining agreements are widespread in both the pri-
 vate and public sectors; in the latter they cover 60 percent of workers, notwithstand-
 ing that only about 10 percent of them are actually union members.
 The law prohibits discrimination by employers against union members and orga-
 nizers. Discrimination cases have priority in the labor courts. Legislation in 1990
 gave unions a role in controlling temporary work contracts to prevent abuse of these
 and of termination actions. Nonetheless, unions contend that employers discrimi-
 nate in many cases by refusing to renew the temporary employment contract of a
 worker who has engaged in union organizing;, more than a third of all employees
 in Spain are under temporary contracts, and the number is growing.
 Labor regulations and practices in free trade zones and export processing zones
 are the same as in the rest of the country. Union membership in these zones is re-
 portedly higher than the average throughout the economy.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced or compulsory labor is out-
 lawed and is not practiced. The legislation is effectively enforced.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The statutory minimum age for
 employment is 16 years. The Ministry of Labor and Social Security is primarily re-
 sponsil for enforcement. The minimum age is effectively enforced in major indus-
 tries and in the service sector. It is more difficult to control on small farms and in
 family-owned businesses. Legislation prohibiting child labor is effectively enforced
 in the special economic zones. The law also prohibits the employment of persons
 under age 18 at night, for overtime work, or in sectors considered hazardous.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The legal minimum wage for workers over age
 18 is considered sufficient for a decent standard of living. The daily national mini-
 mum wage rate is $17.00 (Ptas 2,090); for those ages 16 and 17 it is $11.25 (Ptas
 1,381). The Government revises these rates every year in line with the consumer
 price index, and the Ministry of Labor and Social Security effectively enforces them.
 The law sets a 40-hour workweek with an unbroken rest period of 36 hours after
 each 40 hours worked. Workers enjoy 12 paid holidays a year and a month's paid
 vacation. Worktime limits are effectively enforced.
 Government mechanisms exist for enforcing working conditions and occupational
 health and safety rules, but bureaucratic procedures are cumbersome and ineffi-
 cient. The Government is revising safety and health legislation to conform to Euro-
 pean Union directives. The National Institute of Safety and Health in the Ministry
 of Labor has technical responsibility for developing labor standards, but the
 Inspectorate of Labor has responsibility for enforcing the legislation through judicial
 action when infractions are found. Workers have legal protection for filing com-
 plaints about hazardous conditions.
