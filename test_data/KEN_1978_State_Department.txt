 KENYA
 Kenya's political system is open and vigorous. Its
 Constitution offers substantial protection to funda-
 mental rights and liberties, and the judicial system
 is independent and impartial. President Daniel arap
 Moi, who succeeded President Kenyatta upon the latter's
 death in August 1978, indicated his personal commitment
 to protecting Kenya's political heritage by pledging
 to uphold constitutional freedoms. His orderly acces-
 sion to power proceeded entirely in accordance with the
 Constitution. While the Kenyatta Government had at
 times used detention laws and other restrictive powers
 in order to silence a few critics of the, senior leader-
 ship, President Moi released all sixteen political
 prisoners on December 12, 1978.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 There is no indication that torture is practiced in
 Kenya.   It is specifically forbidden by the Kenyan
 Constitution.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 There are effective legal safeguards against cruel,
 inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, although
 prison conditions are often poor.
 c. Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 Political detention is permitted under the Public
 Security Act. Detainees must be informed of the
 reasons for their detention within five days of arrest,
 and they have the right to review of their cases every
 six months by a  special tribunal. The tribunal is
 appointed by the President, it meets in camera, and
 
 
 91
 the Government is not bound to comply with its findings.
 The incidence of politically motivated arrests under
 these provisions has been low. Cases under the former
 Government included two prominent dissident members of
 Parliament arrested in the aftermath of the March 1975
 murder of a leading parliamentary critic of the regime,
 the arrest in May 1977 of a vocal parliamentary
 backbencher who had alleged corruption on the part of
 high government officials and the arrest at the end of
 1977 of a prominent novelist whose works strongly
 criticized the Kenyan elite. These individuals were
 among those released by President Moi on December 12,
 1978.-
 d. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The right to a fair public trial is respected
 in Kenya except for detention cases lodged under the
 Public Security Act. There the authority of the
 regular courts is limited to ensuring compliance with
 the procedural provisions of the Public Security Act
 which are detailed above in section l.c.
 e. Invasion of the Home
 The generally high standard of impartiality of the
 Kenyan courts has been paralleled by respect for due
 process on the part of Kenyan authorities. As a
 consequence, the sanctity of the home and other
 guarantees of English common law are respected in
 Kenya.
 2. Government Policies Relating to the Fulfillment
 of Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care
 and Education
 Kenya's economic development policies, emphasizing
 free enterprise and the profit motive, have produced a
 good record of economic growth. The Government has
 responded to the needs of the poor. It controls the
 price of basic foodstuffs and has programs aimed at
 providing low-cost housing, employment in the urban
 areas and improvement of conditions for smallholders
 in the rural areas. Health care and education are
 
 
 priority areas for future government development
 spending. Despite these measures, distribution of
 income and wealth is substantially unequal. The
 reduction of high-level corruption, a national problem,
 is a priority program of the new administration. It
 is not clear that corruption diverts significant
 resources from the poor majority.
 3. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Includ-
 ing:
 a. Freedom of Thought, Speech, Press, Religion
 and Assembly
 Freedom of expression and communication in Kenya can
 be restricted under various sections of the penal
 code. The existence and occasional use of the detention
 laws inhibit public exchage of views on sensitive
 political topics. The Government discourages student
 political activism. Although there is no formal
 censorship of the press, government guidelines are
 issued on politically sensitive issues and are usually
 observed by the media. However, Kenya's press is
 active and assertive in reporting and commenting on
 internal developments. Freedoms of assembly and
 association are limited by the Public Order and Police
 Act which gives local administrative authorities and
 police wide powers to control public meetings. It is
 an offense to convene or attend an unlicensed meeting.
 With these powers, the Government can prevent meetings
 by political opponents, but has seldom done so. Under
 the Societies Act the Government can refuse to register
 any society which it believes may pursue activities
 harmful to public security. This denial of registry,
 combined with the restrictions of the Public Order and
 Police Act, can effectively prevent an organization
 from operating. The only opposition political party,
 the Kenyan African Democratic Union, remains proscribed
 under this Act. The Government used the same powers
 to ban the Jehovah's Witnesses in 1973, but later
 revoked the ban when threatened with a court test of
 the constitutionality of the Societies Act. Kenya has
 an active trade union movement. There is full freedom
 
 
 of religion.
 b. Freedom of Movement within the Country, Foreign
 Travel and Emigration
 Under presidential detention power individuals may be
 restricted in their movements within the country,
 but this power has not been used in recent years.
 Foreign travel and emigration are not restricted.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Kenya has only one political party, the Kenya African
 National Union, although there is no law against the
 formation of others. The Government has substantial
 powers to restrict political activity.  (See 3.a. above.)
 At the same time, political activity within this
 framework is open to all Kenyans and is vigorous.
 Parliamentary elections in 1969 and 1974 featured many
 lively contests and resulted in the defeat of many
 incumbents. Kenyan society is patriarchal, and atti-
 tudes towards the role of women reflect traditional
 values. While sexual discrimination is not government
 policy, few women hold positions of authority. Five
 women are members of parliament and one assistant
 minister is a woman.
 4. Government Attitude and Record Regarding Inter-
 national and Non-Governmental Investigation of
 Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The Kenyan Government barred entry into Kenya by
 journalists who were critical of President Kenyatta
 and his family. On several occasions Attorney General
 Charles Njonjo has been critical of international
 bodies such as Amnesty International. In June 1978 he
 warned Amnesty International to refrain from inter-
 fering in the Government of Kenya's use of detention
 under the Public Security Act.
