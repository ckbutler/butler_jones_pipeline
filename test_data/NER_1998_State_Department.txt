 NIGER
 Niger is a republic dominated by a strong presidency. On January 27, 1996, a
 group of army officers led by then-Colonel Ibrahim Mainassara Bare overthrew the
 elected government. The leaders of the coup d'etat established a Military Council
 of National Salvation and a subordinate interim cabinet. The Government subse-
 quently organized a constitutional conference, held a referendum on the new Con-
 stitution, and conducted a seriously flawed presidential election, in which Bare was
 declared the winner. The opposition boycotted the November 1996 legislative elec-
 tions. Progovernment parties and sympathizers claimed all 83 National Assembly
 seats. In July the Government and the opposition agreed to cooperate and hold the
 country's first local elections, in February 1999, to be supervised by a newly formed
 independent electoral commission. The judiciary remains subject to executive inter-
 ference.
 Security forces consist of the army, the Republican Guard, the gendarmerie (para-
 military police), and the national police. The police and the gendarmerie tradition-
 ally have primary responsibility for internal security. However, since the 1996 coup
 the army has had a much more prominent role. Army officers led the coup with
 some support from the gendarmerie. Some members of the security forces committed
 serious human rights abuses during the year.
 The economy is based mainly on traditional subsistence farming, herding, small
 trading, and informal markets. Less than 15 percent of the economy is in the mod-
 ern sector. Uranium is the most important export. Per capita income is about $230.
 Drought, deforestation, soil degradation, low literacy, a flat uranium market, high
 import prices and burdensome debt further weakened the already troubled economy.
 Niger is heavily dependent on foreign assistance, which diminished briefly after the
 1996 coup, but largely has been restored.
 The Government's human rights record improved in some respects, but worsened
 in others, and many serious problems remain. The 1996 coup and the fraudulent
 1996 presidential election effectively disenfranchised citizens, preventing them from
 exercising their right to change their government. Security forces on occasion intimi-
 dated opposition political figures and violated laws governing searches, treatment
 of prisoners, and length of detention. Prison conditions remained poor, and arbitrary
 arrest and detention remain problems. The overloaded judicial system and delays
 in trials resulted in long periods of pretrial confinement. The judiciary is also sub-
 ject to executive influence. The Government continued to ban some peaceable meet-
 ings and demonstrations, although less often than in previous years. The Govern-
 ment intimidated the private press, intensified restrictions on broadcast media and
 closed a private radio station, and arrested, detained, and mistreated journalists.
 However, in August the Government enacted amendments that moderated some as-
 pects of its restrictive 1997 press law, and private newspapers often highly critical
 of the Government and its policies continued to publish. The Government continued
 to limit freedom of association and restricted freedom of movement. Societal dis-
 crimination and domestic violence against women continued to be serious problems.
 Female genital mutilation persists, despite government efforts to combat it. There
 is societal discrimination against the disabled and against ethnic minorities. The
 Government restricts some worker rights.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political
 killings by government officials. However, security forces were involved in several
 incidents in which they killed people. On January 21, a reportedly deranged student
 tried to gain access to the presidential compound by vehicle, and a presidential
 guard shot and killed by. On February 20, a presidential guard fired into a vehicle
 that was approaching the presidential compound late at night, killing all four of the
 civilian occupants. The guards were not disciplined; they each received cash awards
 for their efforts. On February 21, a presidential guard shot and killed a member
 of the Interior Ministry's Republican Guard at the entrance of the presidential com-
 pound. The presidential guard was arrested and awaited judicial proceedings at
 year's end.
 
 
 309
 At the end of February, soldiers in Diffa, Agadez, and Zinder mutinied and took
 government officials hostage, demanding payment of their salaries. Shots were fired
 into the air but no deaths were reported. No soldiers were disciplined. However, in
 May several units of the Republican Guard also mutinied over nonpayment of sala-
 ries. A number of persons were injured and four members of the Republican Guard
 were killed when the Presidential Guard ended the mutiny. The mutiny leaders
 were arrested.
 Disagreements over land usage between sedentary farmers and herders led to at
 least two incidents of mob violence and killings in the Dosso and Tillaberry depart-
 ments in the southwest region.
 Violence related to the Tuareg ethnic insurgency in the north continued to de-
 crease in the wake of the November 1997 supplemental peace accord, which has
 been followed by the return of many refugees from Algeria.
 On August 21, in Ndjamena, Chad, the Government signed a cease-fire and a
 peace accord with the Toubou ethnic group's Democratic Front for Renewal (FDR),
 based in eastern Niger, which was the last major group still engaged in armed con-
 flict with the Government. The agreement calls for the incorporation of rebel ele-
 ments into government security and civilian services.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution prohibits such practices and in 1998, unlike the previous year,
 there were no reports that officials employed them.
 In April paramilitary police fired tear gas to break up groups of demonstrators
 who were protesting the rule of President Bare.
 Prison conditions are poor. Prisons are underfunded and understaffed. They are
 overcrowded and diet, health, and sanitary conditions are very poor. Prisoners are
 segregated by sex, but minors and adults are incarcerated together. Family visits
 are allowed, and prisoners can receive supplemental food and other necessities from
 their families. There are no reports of unduly harsh treatment, beyond the very poor
 conditions of detention, but petty corruption among prison staff is reported to be
 rampant.
 Human rights monitors, including the International Committee of the Red Cross,
 have unrestricted access to prisons and detention centers and visit them.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Arbitary arrest and detention are prob-
 lems. Although the Constitution prohibits arbitrary arrest and detention, and laws
 officially prohibit detention without charge in excess of 48 hours, police violate these
 provisions in practice. If police fail to gather sufficient evidence within the detention
 period, the prosecutor gives the case to another officer, and a new 48-hour detention
 period begins. Police, acting under authority given them by the Security Law, con-
 duct sweeps to detain criminals and ensure that identity documents are in order.
 The judicial system is seriously overloaded. There are no statutory limits on pre-
 trial confinement of indicted persons. Detention frequently lasts months or years.
 Some persons have been waiting as long as 7 years to be charged. Of 865 prisoners
 in Niamey's prison in April, 666 (77 percent) were awaiting trial or had no charges
 brought against them. On September 23, the police picked up 900 people for ques-
 tioning, of whom 129 were found to be wanted for various infractions; they were ar-
 rested and remained in detention at year's end.
 The law provides for a right to counsel, although there is only one defense attor-
 ney known to have a private practice outside the capital. A defendant has the right
 to a lawyer immediately upon detention. The State provides a defense attorney for
 indigents.
 Bail is available for crimes carrying a penalty of less than 10 years imprison-
 ment. Widespread ignorance of the law and lack of financial means prevent full ex-
 ercise of these rights.
 On January 1, police arrested former Prime Minister Hama Amabou and former
 ministers Mohamed Bazoum and Issoufou Assoumane, among others, for allegedly
 plotting to assassinate the President. They were released after a week in detention
 and charges were never filed. On May 3, security forces arrested Elhadjhi
 Oubandawaki, an activist in the opposition CDS party, during the Governments clo-
 sure of a private radio station that had broadcast a protest of government press cen-
 sorship (see Section 2.a.). He was released without being charged within 3 weeks
 of being arrested.
 The Constitution prohibits exile, and there were no reports of its use.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution provides for an independent judi-
 ciary, but it is subject to executive interference. Although the Supreme Court has
 on occasion asserted its independence, human rights groups assert that family and
 business ties influence the lower courts and undermine their integrity. Judges some-
 
 
 310
 times fear reassignment or having their financial benefits reduced if they render a
 decision unfavorable to the Government.
 Defendants and prosecutors may appeal a verdict, first to the Court of Appeals,
 then to the Supreme Court. The Court of Appeals reviews questions of fact and law,
 while the Supreme Court reviews only the application of the law and constitutional
 questions.
 The State Security Court that the Government reestablished in 1997, with juris-
 diction over crimes against national security, lapsed during the year, its members
 were neither reappointed nor replaced when their 1-year terms expired.
 Traditional chiefs can act as mediators and counselors and have authority in the
 realm of customary law as well as status under modern law where they are des-
 ignated as auxiliaries to local administrators. They are charged with collecting local
 taxes and receive stipends from the Government but do not have police or judicial
 powers and can only mediate, not arbitrate, disputes under customary law. Cus-
 tomary courts, located only in large towns and cities, try cases involving divorce or
 inheritance. They are headed by a legal practitioner with basic legal education who
 is advised by an assessor knowledgeable in the society's traditions. The judicial ac-
 tions of chiefs and customary courts are not regulated by code, and defendants may
 appeal a verdict to the formal court system. Women do not have equal legal status
 with men and do not enjoy the same access to legal redress (see Section 5).
 Defendants have the right to counsel, to be present at trial, to confront witnesses,
 to examine the evidence against them, and to appeal verdicts. The Constitution af-
 firms the presumption of innocence. The law provides for counsel at public expense
 for minors and indigent defendants charged with crimes carrying a sentence of 10
 years or more. Although lawyers comply with government requests to provide coun-
 sel, they generally are not remunerated by the Government.
 At year's end, there were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The law
 requires that police have a search warrant, normally issued by a judge. Police may
 search without warrants when they have strong suspicion that a house shelters
 criminals or stolen property. However, human rights organizations report that police
 often conduct routine searches without warrants. The State Security Law also pro-
 vides for warrantless searches.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech
 and of the press, but the Government did not respect this right in practice.
 The Government publishes a French-language daily, Le Sahel, and its weekend
 edition. There are about 12' domestically published private French-language
 weeklies or monthlies, some of which are loosely affiliated with political parties. The
 private press remained relatively assertive in criticizing government actions, but
 there were several attempts by the Government to stifle freedom of the press. For-
 eign journals circulate and report freely. In August the Government enacted amend-
 ments that relaxed some of the restrictions of the 1997 press law that had imposed
 severe criminal penalties for libel, especially for libeling the President, and had cir-
 cumscribed press activities. The August amendments lightened the 1997 law's libel
 penalties and its restrictions on the publication of government documents. However,
 the strict accreditation requirements imposed on journalists by the 1997 law re-
 mained in place.
 On April 16, 11 men, some of whom wore military uniforms, attacked that the
 offices and printing plant of the private weekly Le Republican and unsuccessfully
 tried to burn down the print shop. Police investigated and ultimately filed false
 charges of insurance fraud against the weekly's owner. Although the owner has
 been released, the charges have not been dropped formally.
 The Government on May 13 closed down the offices of several private newspapers,
 ostensibly for nonpayment of taxes. The newspapers reopened 2 weeks later.
 Since literacy and personal incomes are both very low, radio is the most important
 medium of public communication. The government-owned radio Voix du Sahel trans-
 mits 14 hours per day, providing news and other programs in French, Hausa,
 Zarma, Tamashek, Fulfulde (also known as Fulani or Peuhl), Kanouri and several
 other local languages. Several private radio stations broadcast on FM in Niamey,
 including Radio France International, Africa Number One, Radio et Musique, Radio
 Souda, Radio Tenere, and Anfani; the last four are locally owned and feature popu-
 lar news programs in local languages, including Zarma and Hausa.
 These private radio stations were generally less critical of government actions
 than the private newspapers were. Radio Afani remained the domestic station most
 critical of the Government. Radio et Musique has tried to present news coverage
 that includes opposition as well as Government points of view. The other private
 
 
 domestic radio stations are smaller and are either owned by individuals who agree
 with the Government or offer little domestic news programming.
 President Bare on April 29 warned private radio stations to stop carrying reports
 and statements capable of heightening political tension. Police on May 3 shut down
 a Voice of America (VOA) affiliate, Radio Afani, shortly after it broadcast a state-
 ment by journalists protesting government restrctions on media freedom. Moussa
 Tchangari, director of the newspaper, L'Alternative, and Souleymane Keita, the
 British Broadcasting Company (BBC) correspondent from Zinder, were arrested and
 later released for their role in drafting and broadcasting the rotest. On August 1,
 the Governmens Superior Council on Communication prohibited domestic broad-
 casting services from rebroadcasting programs of foreign origin, such as VOA, BBC,
 and Deutsche Welle programs without a time delay that would enable the Govern-
 ment to hold local broadcasters responsible for theprograms' content. However, do-
 mestic affiliates of international services generally did not comply with this prohibi-
 tion, and the Government apparently did not enforce it.
 The government-operated multilingal National Radio Service provided minimal
 air time for opposition political views.
 Television is a far less important medium than radio. Government-owned Tele-
 Sahel broadcasts about 4 hours every evening, with programming emphasizing news
 in French and other major national languages. There are no private television
 broadcasting stations, apparently because the economic conditions necessary to sup-
 port one may not exist. The director of a private radio station operates a wireless
 cable television service for the capital, offering access to international channels.
 SONITEL, the state-owned telephone monopoly, operates the country's only Inter-
 net service provider. There are no private Internet service providers because govern-
 ment regulation of the telecommunications sector sets prices at prohibitive levels;
 several individuals hope to enter the Internet service provider market after an an-
 ticipated deregulation of the sector. The Government does not restrict access to the
 Internet through SONITEL, although technical difficulties often do.
 The news coverage of the state-owned media reflects government priorities. Presi-
 dential activities and conferences dealing with development issues are always cov-
 ered. Analysis or investigative reporting on domestic topics is extremely rare. Cov-
 erage of opposition party events has also been sparse, even during election cam-
 paigns-although, during the 1996 legislative elections, there were no opposition
 candidates to cover. During August and September, state-owned television, in com-
 pliance with new guidelines from the Ministry of Communications, devoted more
 news coverage to opposition candidates. However, during the final quarter of the
 year, state-owned television news relapsed into its prior habit of giving much more
 coverage to the ruling party than to all opposition parties combined. The President's
 brother was credibly said to have encouraged this return to past form.
 Academic freedom is respected.
 University students on February 27 conducted two violent demonstrations to pro-
 test the deterioration of educational facilities and nonpayment of their stipends
 (then 2 years in arrears). Student used rocks, Molotv cocktails, darts, and arrows.
 Several students and gendarmes were injured. The university dorms and dining fa-
 cilities were closed to students.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 freedom of assembly; however, the Government on occasion banned peaceable meet-
 ings and demonstrations. The Government retains the authority to prohibit gather-
 ings either under tense social conditions or if advance notice (48 hours) is not pro-
 vided. Opposition parties are legally permitted to hold demonstrations but their re-
 quests for ermission to march were occasionally denied or canceled. The Govern-
 ment prohited several opposition demonstrations during April and May, when op-
 position leaders were calling for the replacement of President Bare. During the year,
 unlike some recent years, the security forces did not break up any peaceful dem-
 onstrations.
 The Constitution, with some limitations, provides for freedom of association. Citi-
 zens may form political parties of any kind except those based on ethnicity, religion,
 or region, and the Government respects these provisions in practice. There are 24
 political parties.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution prohibits any interference with the
 practice of religion, and the Government generaly respects freedom of religion. Most
 citizens practice Islam. Christians (including Jehovah's Witnesses) and Baha'is prac-
 tice freely. Foreign missionaries work freely, but their organizations must be reg-
 istered as Nigerien associations.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The law provides for freedom of movement and does not restrict either
 emigration or repatriation. However, security forces at checkpoints monitor the tray-
 
 
 el of persons and the circulation of goods, particularly near major population cen-
 ters, and sometimes demand extra payments. Attacks by bandits on major routes
 to the north have declined considerably, although persons often travel in convoys
 with military escorts for security. Among the Hausa and Fulani peoples in eastern
 Niger, some women are cloistered and may leave their homes only if escorted by
 a male and usually only after dark (see Section 5).
 In May the Government stopped restricting international travel by opposition fig-
 ures; immigration officials no longer maintain a list of persons who may not leave
 the country.
 The Government cooperates with the office of the United Nations High Commis-
 sioner for Refugees (UNHOR) and other humanitarian organizations in assisting ref-
 ugees. In accordance with United Nations principles, the Government offers first
 asylum to refugees. To date it has offered asylum to several thousand persons from
 neighboring countries as well as smaller numbers from distant countries. There re-
 main a few Chadian refugee families; 3,000 Tuareg refugees from Mali returned to
 their country with UNHCR assistance and Nigerien refugees in Algeria were repa-
 triated voluntarily earlier this year.
 A human rights organization received one unconfirmed report that two Chadian
 refugees allegedly were deported forcibly to an unknown destination. Apart from
 this, there were no reports of forced repatriation of refugees or of the forced return
 of persons to a country where they feared persecution.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The Constitution provides for the right of citizens to change their Government;
 however, the January 1996 coup and the fraudulent presidential election later that
 year effectively disenfranchised citizens, preventing them from exercising this right.
 President Bare rules by decree when the National Assembly is not in session, and
 his regime continues to govern, although its field of maneuver is circumscribed by
 fiscal constraints. The executive is largely unchecked by the weak assembly and ju-
 dicial branches. The Prime Minister and all other ministers serve at the pleasure
 of the President. The'Council of Ministers, over which the President presides, ap-
 points key officials including members of the Supreme Court, officers of the security
 forces, regional governors, public and private administrators, and the heads of state-
 owned companies. The President can initiate legislation either by proposing an act
 to the National Assembly or by submitting it to a popular referendum.
 President Bare overthrew a democratically elected Government. In the days fol-
 lowing the coup, Bare and the coup leadership dissolved the National Assembly,
 banned political party activity, suspended the Constitution, and declared a state of
 emergency.
 In a 1996 referendum with a low turnout, voters approved a new constitution that
 reiterated rights granted under the 1992 document. The Constitution provides for
 a political system with checks and balances, an ethnically representative 83-seat
 National Assembly, and an independent judiciary. Citizens 18 years of age and over
 can vote, and voting is by secret ballot. The most important constitutional changes
 increased the powers of the presidency and diminished those of the prime minister.
 The military government organized a presidential election in July 1996, in which
 General Bare ran against four political party candidates. However, midway through
 the voting, when preliminary results showed Bare running last, the regime dis-
 missed the independent electoral commission, took control of the ballot boxes, and
 prevented political party representatives and neutral observers from monitoring the
 vote tabulation. Bare claimed 52 percent of the vote, a result widely viewed as
 fraudulent by both local and international observers.
 In November 1996, a new National Assembly was chosen by popular vote in a low-
 turnout contest boycotted by most of the political opposition. The legislative elec-
 tions generally were regarded as administratively correct but meaningless since the
 opposition fully boycotted them. Observers selectively monitored the election.
 In January the Government arrested three prominent opposition figures on sus-
 picion of plotting to assassinate the President. They spent a week in detention be-
 fore being released without being charged. The opposition in April launched a cam-
 paign to force Bare to resign. Violent demonstrations were followed by harassment
 of opposition members and journalists. The Government prohibited some opposition
 demonstrations.
 The Government and 11 opposition parties on July 31 reached an agreement to
 hold local elections with the full participation of all parties. The Government agreed
 to restore the electoral code of 1996, and to accept: The independent electoral com-
 mission as constituted in 1997; a formula for determining the members of the Con-
 stitutional Chamber; equitable access to the media; amending the press law; neu-
 
 
 trality of government officials; and nonuse of state resources for partisan activities.
 The Government has honored these commitments, and elections were scheduled for
 February 7, 1999.
 In these elections, voters were to choose members of governing councils for re-
 gional, departmental, and community governments. The central Government is to
 continue to appoint the governors, prefects, and mayors who will continue to exer-
 cise executive power at these levels, respectively. The subnational governments are
 to be empowered within prescribed limits to tax, borrow and receive external assist-
 ance directly. Nevertheless, the extent to which they may have to rely on the central
 Government for their revenues and administrative personnel remains unclear.
 Women traditionally play a subordinate role in politics. The societal practice of
 husbands' voting their wives' proxy ballots effectively disenfranchises many women.
 This practice was used widely in presidential and National Assembly elections.
 In the National Assembly elected in November 1996, only 1 of the 83 elected
 members was female, compared with 3 in the previous legislature. The last precoup
 government appointed five women to cabinet positions; the present one has three
 female ministers.
 The Government has supported greater minority representation in the National
 Assembly, but no seats in the National Assembly are reserved for ethnic minorities.
 President Bare is from the Hausa ethnic group; previous presidents have been from
 both of the country's two largest ethnic groups (see Section 5). All major groups are
 represented in the Government.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Several independent human rights groups and associations normally operate with-
 out government hindrance, and they publish findings and conclusions that often are
 highiy critical of the Government in their own publications and in the small private
 press. Notable among the associations are the Nigerien Association for the Defense
 of Human Rights (ANDDH); Democracy, Liberty, and Development (DLD) the
 Nigerien League for the Defense of Human Rights (LNDH); the Network for the In-
 tegration and Diffusion of the Rights in the Rural Milieu (known as "ridd-fitla"); the
 Niger Independent Magistrates Association (SAMAN); the Observatoire Nationale
 des Elections (ONE), a reconstitution of the 1996 "Collectif," and the Association of
 Women Jurists of Niger. There are several other women's rights groups. The Inter-
 national Committee for the Red Cross is active in Niger. The Government, which
 welcomed international observers during the 1996 elections, invited international
 observers to the February 1999 subnational elections.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution prohibits discrimination based on sex, social origin, race, eth-
 nicity, or religion. In practice, however, there is discrimination against women, chil-
 dren, ethnic minorities, and disabled persons, including limited economic and politi-
 cal opportunities.
 Women.-Domestic violence against women is widespread, although firm statistics
 are lacking. Wifebeating is reportedly common, even in upper social strata. Families
 often intervene to prevent the worst abuses, and women may (and do) divorce be-
 cause of physical abuse. While women have the right to seek redress in the cus-
 tomary or modem courts, few do so, due to ignorance of the legal system, fear of
 social stigma, or fear of repudiation. Women's rights organizations report that pros-
 titution is often the only economic alternative for a woman who wants to leave her
 husband.
 Despite the Constitution's provisions for women's rights, the deep-seated tradi-
 tional belief in the submission of women to men results in discrimination in the po-
 litical process (see Section 3) and in education, employment, and property rights.
 Discrimination is worse in rural areas, where women do much of the subsistence
 farming as well as child-rearing, water- and wood-gathering, and other chores. De-
 spite constituting 47 percent of the work force, women have made only modest in-
 roads in civil service and professional employment and remain underrepresented in
 these areas.
 Women's inferior legal status is evident, for example, in head of household status:
 A male head of household has certain legal rights, but divorced or widowed women,
 even with children, are not considered to be heads of households. In 1994 the Gov-
 ernment considered a draft family code intended to eliminate gender bias in inherit-
 ance rights, land tenure, and child custody, as well as to end the practice of repudi-
 ation, which permits a husband to obtain an immediate divorce with no further re-
 sponsibility for his wife or children. However, in June 1994, when Islamic associa-
 
 
 314
 tions condemned the draft code, the then Government suspended discussions. The
 Bare Government has taken no further action, nor has the current legislature dis-
 cussed the draft family code. Islamic militants reportedly threatened women who
 supported the code with physical harm.
 Children.-Although the Constitution provides that the State promote children's
 welfare, financial resources are extremely limited. The minimum period of compul-
 sory education is 6 years. However, only about 25 percent of children of primary
 school age attend school, and about 60 percent of those who finish primary schools
 are boys.
 The majority of young girls are kept at home to work and rarely attend school
 for more than a few years, resulting in a female literacy rate of 7 percent, compared
 with 18 percent for males. Tradition among some ethnic groups allows young girls
 from rural families to enter into marriage agreements on the basis of which girls
 are sent at the age of 10 or 12 to join their husbands' families under the tutelage
 of their mothers-in-law. There are credible reports of underage girls being drawn
 into prostitution, sometimes with the complicity of the family
 Female genital mutilation (FGM), which is widely condemned by international
 health experts as damaging to both physical and psychological health, is practiced
 by severa ethnic groups in the -extreme west and far eastern areas of the country.
 Clitoridectomy is the most common form of FGM. FGM is not illegal, but the Gov-
 ernment is firmly engaged in an effort to eliminate the practice. The Government
 is working closely with a local nongovernmental organization (NGO), the United Na-
 tions Children's Fund, and other donors to develop and distribute educational mate-
 rials at government clinics and maternal health centers.
 People With Disabilities.-The Constitution mandates that the State provide for
 persons with disabilities. However, the Government has yet to implement regula-
 tions to mandate accessibility to buildings and education for those with special
 needs. Regulations do not mandate accessibility to public transport, of which there
 is little. Societal discrimination against persons with disabilities exists.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-The Hausa and Djerma ethnic groups make
 up about 56 percent and 22 percent, respectively, of the country's population of
 nearly 10 million. These two groups also dominate government and business. Ethnic
 minorities-Tuareg, Fulani, Toubou, Kanouri, and Arab-continue to assert that the
 Hausa and Djerma discriminate against them. The Government has increased edu-
 cation and health care for ethnic minorities. It supports the April 1995 peace accord,
 which called for special development efforts in the north where the Tuareg popu-
 lation is dominant. However, nomadic peoples, such as Tuaregs and many Fulani,
 continue to have less access to government services.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution provides formal recognition of
 workers' longstanding right to establish and join trade unions. However, more than
 95 percent of the work force is employed in the nonunionized subsistence agricul-
 tural and small trading sectors.
 The National Union of Nigerien Workers (USTN), a federation made up of 38
 unions, represents the majority of salary earners; most are government employees,
 such as civil servants, teachers, and employees in state-owned corporations. The
 USTN and the affiliatedNational Union of Nigerien Teachers (SNEN) profess politi-
 cal autonomy, but like most unions, have informal ties to political parties. There is
 also a small breakaway union confederation, and independent teachers' and mag-
 istrates' unions. However, police, water, and forest worker unions, shut down by the
 Government in 1996 because of their "paramilitary nature," remain suspended. The
 customs workers union, suspended in 1996 for the same reason, was dissolved in
 1997.
 The Constitution provides for the right to strike except for security forces and p0-
 lice. In March 1994, the National Assembly passed a strike law specifying that labor
 must give notice and begin negotiations before work is stopped; that public workers
 must maintain a minimum level of service during a strike; that the Government can
 requisition workers to provide minimum service; and that striking public sector
 workers not be paid for the time they are on strike. The latter condition already
 prevailed in the private sector.
 During 1998 labor continued to challenge the Government on various issues af-
 fecting workers. The USTN called many short strikes, generally of 1 to 3 days' dura-
 tion, to support demands for: Payment of several months' wage arrears; cancellation
 of salary reductions for civil servants and of an increase in income tax rates; and
 an end to government plans to privatize several state enterprises. Although these
 strikes failed to achieve their objectives, they demonstrated that the right to strike,
 within accepted procedures, is permitted.
 
 
 315
 The USTN is a member of the Organization of African Trade Union Unity and
 abides by that organization's policy of having no formal affiliations outside the Afri-
 can continent. However, it enjoys assistance from some international unions, and in-
 dividual unions such as the teachers' union are affiliated with international trade
 union secretariats.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-In addition to the Constitu-
 tion and the Labor Code, there is a basic framework agreement, negotiated by the
 USTN's predecessor, employers, and the Government, which defines all classes and
 categories of work, establishes basic conditions of work, and defines union activities.
 In private and state-owned enterprises, unions widely use their right to bargain col-
 lectively with management without government interference for wages over and
 above the statutory minimum as well as for more favorable work conditions. Collec-
 tive bargaining also exists in the public sector. However, since most organized work-
 ers, including teachers, are government employees, the Government is involved in
 most bargaining agreements. The USTN represents civil servants in bargaining
 with the Government, and agreements between labor and management apply uni-
 formly to all employees.
 The Labor Code is based on International Labor Organization principles. It pro-
 tects the right to organize and prohibits antiunion discrimination by employers.
 Labor unions reported no such discrimination.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Labor Code prohibits forced
 or compulsory labor, except by legally convicted prisoners. The code does not specifi-
 cally mention forced or bonded labor by children. There were no reports of forced
 and bonded labor.
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment.-Child
 labor in nonindustrial enterprises is permitted by law under certain conditions.
 Children under the age of 14 must obtain special authorization to work, and those
 14 to 18 years of age are subject to limitation on hours (a maximum of 4/2 hours
 per day) and types of employment (no industrial work) so that schooling may con-
 tinue. Minimum compulsory education is 6 years, but far fewer than half of school-
 age children complete 6 years of education.
 The law requires employers to ensure minimum sanitary working conditions for
 children. Law and practice prohibit child labor in industrial work. Forced or bonded
 labor by children is not specifically prohibited, but there were no reports that it oc-
 curred (see Section 6.c.). Ministry of Labor inspectors enforce child labor laws. Child
 labor is practically nonexistent in the formal (wage) sector, although children work
 in the unregulated agricultural, commercial, and artisan sectors, and some, espe-
 cially foreign youths, are hired in homes as general helpers and baby sitters for very
 low pay. Rural children (the majority) regularly work with their families from a very
 early age-helping in the fields, pounding grain, tending animals, getting firewood
 and water, and other similar tasks. Some children are kept out of school to guide
 a blind relative on begging rounds. Others are sometimes employed by marabouts
 (Koranic teachers) to beg in the streets. There is no official recognition of this labor.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The Labor Code establishes a minimum wage
 for salaried workers of each class and category within the formal sector. The lowest
 minimum wage is $42 (24,565 CFA francs) per month. Additional salary is granted
 for each family member and for such working conditions as night shifts and re-
 quired travel. Minimum wages are not sufficient to provide a decent standard of liv-
 ing for workers and their families. Government salaries are substantially in arrears,
 which was a factor in stimulating strikes and military mutinies during the year.
 Most households have multiple earners (largely in informal commerce) and rely on
 the extended family for support.
 The legal workweek is 40 hours with a minimum of one 24-hour rest period. How-
 ever, for certain occupations the Ministry of Labor authorizes longer workweeks of
 up to 72 hours. There were no reports of violations.
 The Labor Code also establishes occupational safety and health standards. How-
 ever, due to staff shortages, inspectors focus on safety violations only in the most
 dangerous industries: mining, building, and manufacturing. Although generally sat-
 isfied with the safety equipment provided by employers, citing in particular ade-
 quate protection from radiation in the uranium mines, union workers are in many
 cases not well informed of the risks posed by their jobs. Workers have the right to
 remove themselves from hazardous conditions without fear of losing their jobs.
