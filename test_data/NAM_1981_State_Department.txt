 NAMIBIA*
 
 Seized from the Germans in 1915, South West Africa was
 administered by South Africa under a League of Nations
 mandate following World War I. With the demise of the
 League and the founding of the United Nations in 1946,
 the status of South West Africa became the subject of
 an international dispute. In 1966, the UN General
 Assembly declared South Africa was no longer the lawful
 authority in the Territory. Henceforth, the Territory
 was to come under the direct responsibility of the UN.
 The illegality of South African control of Namibia (as
 the Territory had come to be known) was later affirmed
 by the UN Security Council and the International Court
 of Justice in 1971. The governing party, the Democratic
 Turnhalle Alliance (DTA), the overwhelming victor in the
 controversial 1978 Constituent Assembly elections, is the
 successor to the multi-racial coalition forged by the long
 and difficult deliberations of the 1975-77 Turnhalle
 Conference.
 With respect to South Africa's application of apartheid to
 Namibia, the International Court of Justice recorded in an
 advisory opinion in 1971 that South Africa adopted "re-
 strictive measures of control" establishing "limitations,
 exclusions or restrictions for the members of the indige-
 nous population groups...." It found South Africa's con-
 duct "based on grounds of race, colour, descent or national
 or ethnic origin" to be "a denial of fundamental human
 rights" and "a flagrant violation of the purposes and
 principles of the (United Nations) Charter." Since 1971,
 concrete steps have been taken to eliminate certain of the
 distinctions referred to by the Court. While ultimate
 authority rests with South Africa's all-white Parliament,
 blacks participate in political institutions established
 by the South African Government. Restrictions on freedom
 of assembly and association have been somewhat relaxed,
 although important legal restrictions still exist which
 separate persons on racial and ethnic grounds.
 Since mid-1966 the South West African Peoples organiza-
 tion (SWAPO) has sought to force the withdrawal of South
 Africa from the Territory. SWAPO's efforts have been
 partly political and partly military, entailing a low-
 level guerrilla war in the northern part of the Terri-
 tory along the Angolan border. This part of Namibia,
 unlike the rest of the country, is densely inhabited by
 the Ovambo people who make up about half the Territory's
 one million population and constitute SWAPO's main
 political base. Martial law is in effect in this part
 of the Territory and there is a substantial South Africa
 Defense Force (SADF) presence. SWAPO tends to operate
 from its main bases in Angola in small-unit guerrilla
 activities. In turn, the South Africans and the new Terri-
 torial Force (SWATF) engage in local counterinsurgency
 action inside the Territory and strike periodically and
 sometimes deeply across the border in an effort to disrupt
 SWAPO capabilities and infrastructure. The activities of
 both sides in the conflict have a predictably negative im-
 pact on the lives of the people of Namibia. There are

 human rights situation there.

 persistent reports of intimidation and abuse of the local
 population by both sides. Civilians are frequently caught
 in crossfire between the two forces; in 1981 at least 64
 non-combatants died in landmine explosions.
 In 1977, the five Western members of the Security Council
 at that time--the United States, the United Kingdom, France,
 the Federal Republic of Germany and Canada--launched a
 major diplomatic initiative to bring about a peaceful,
 internationally recognized settlement in Namibia. This Plan
 (referred to as United Nations Security Council Resolution
 435), which has been broadly accepted by SWAPO, the South
 Africans and the Front Line States, calls for a cessation
 of hostilities, restrictions on the military activities of
 SADP and SWAPO, and free and fair elections supervised by
 the UN. At Geneva in January 1981, South Africa, however,
 declined to agree to name a date for the implementation of
 that Plan. Since that time, the United States in concert
 with its Contact Group partners has been involved in an
 -intensive new initiative to resolve the remaining outstand-
 ing issues and to provide the necessary confidence to all
 parties to allow the beginning of implementation of the UN
 Plan- in 1982. The USG'believes that the success of the
 current Contact Group initiative is central to.the positive
 evolution of human rights in Namibia.
 1.. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 South African authorities operating under, inter alia, the
 Terrorism Act, theiInternal Security Act and the r--levant
 proclamations of- the Administrator General have broad
 police powers to arrest, detain,-and interrogate people.
 Over the years, there have been a number of reports that
 South African police and military authorities have abused,
 mishandled and in certain cases:tortured prisoners. These
 accusations have been supported by local religious leaders
 as well as by other visiting clergymen from South Africa,
 the United Kingdom, and the United States. Verification of
 these reports is, however, extremely difficult, given
 conditions in the Territory and the nature of South African
 security legislation. There are also reports of similar
 abuses perpetuated by SWAPO.
 The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) has
 gained access to most if not all prisoners held by South
 African authorities in Namibia, except those still under
 (sometimes prolonged) interrogation. The ICRC also visits
 the soldiers (Angolan, Cuban, and one Soviet) captured in
 the conflict and reports that their treatment accords with
 internationally recognized standards.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 As noted above, the civilian population in the 'operational"
 areas is subject to harassment, abuse, and intimidation
 from both sides. The Internal Security Act also extends
 the power to "ban' to persons in Namibia. However, this
 power is infrequently used. The Vice-President of SWAPO is
 serving his second five-year ban, and is restricted to a
 township outside Walvis Bay.

 c. Disappearance
 Disappearances in Namibia are a function of the conflict
 situation, flight from the country and the operation of
 martial law and security legislation. Incommunicado deten-
 tions still occur and the government continues to withhold
 information about detainees, making it difficult to judge
 their frequency or duration. In 1981, the government in-
 stituted a military draft for all Namibians, black and
 white, to provide conscripts for the recently constituted
 South West Africa Territorial Force (SWATF). There are
 reports that from hundreds to several thousand young
 Namibians have fled the country to avoid military service.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 Several laws and proclamations in effect in Namibia permit
 arbitrary arrest without access to the courts or to lawyers.
 It is difficult to estimate the number of people so de-
 tained, although several hundred may be held at any one
 time. Most of these people are alleged supporters of the
 internal wing of SWAPO, which is allowed to operate as a
 political party. For example, a number of internal SWAPO
 officials were detained under Administrator General Procla-
 mation Number 9 for varying periods of time following
 disorders at a SWAPO Namibia Day (August 26) rally in
 Katutura Township, outside Windhoek. Detainees are some-
 times freed under "release warrants" which impose
 restrictions on movements and public statements similar to
 "banning" under the Internal Security Act. Although the
 police decline to release statistics on the number of
 "release warrants" in effect, the practice is believed to
 be fairly frequent as a form of conditional release. The
 National Assembly, which in 1981 was given greater autonomy
 by the SAG, has debated a local "terrorism act" which,
 inter alia, would subject anyone who aids SWAPO to a 20-
 year jai-sentence.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Under South African law and the terms of martial law in the
 same areas which inhibits access to civil courts, the right
 to a fair and public trial is sometimes seriously impaired.
 f. Invasion of the Rome
 Invasion of the home is still common, especially in the
 northern operational area. The legal requirement for a
 warrant to search a private home is superseded in many
 cases by the terms of the security legislation and powers
 of the military under martial law.
 2. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 A series of laws, such as the Terrorism and Internal
 Security Acts, circumscribe individual rights to free
 speech, press and association. Nevertheless, limited free-
 dom of speech and the press are permitted in Namibia even
 for recognized opponents of the authorities, including
 SWAPO. This situation is reflected in the fact that while
 conducting a guerrilla war in the north, SWAPO can also
 conduct political rallies in Windhoek, e.g. the August 26
 
 
 261
 Namibia Day gathering. However, these activities are
 closely monitored and proscribed periodically under
 relevant South African and Namibian legislation.
 Freedom of religion is practiced without restriction in
 the Territory. The leaders of most of the religious com-
 munities to one degree or another oppose South African
 control of the Territory and some actively support SWAPO.
 The resulting tension has led to periodic harassment of
 religious leaders. In the summer of 1981, St. Mary's
 Anglican seminary at Odipo was destroyed by fire, an event
 which church leaders charged was the responsibility of SADF
 -elements. The authorities have not yet assigned responsi-
 bility for the bombing of a church printing press in Ovambo
 in 1980.
 There is no provision under the military conscription
 system which was instituted in 1981 for conscientious
 objection to military service.
 With respect to freedom of assembly and association, there
 has been some relaxation since 1977 of the strict legal re-
 quirement for racial segregation in Namibia. This is the
 case, for example, in most restaurants and hotels. How-
 ever, segregation remains the rule in the case of public
 services provided by the ethnically based second-tier
 governments, e.g. health and education, and in public
 services directly controlled by South African authorities,
 e.g. the railroads.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration and Repatriation
 -Freedom of movement in Namibia is restricted to some
 extentby the various security regulations in effect
 (curfews, etc.) and the military situation in the north.
 With the abolition of the pass requirement, however, the
 system can be said to be less rigorous than that applied
 in South Africa.
 .Despite the fact that the South African Government and
 Namibian authorities no longer formally adhere to a sys-
 -tem of exclusive geographic areas for each of the ethnic
 groups, some measures in pursuit of that objective con-
 tinued to be undertaken, possibly for political reasons.
 For example, in 1981 a number of Bushman communities in the
 Kavango were, on short notice and against their will, re-
 moved to Bushmanland by the SADF.
 Strict control of the issuance of passports is exercised
 by the. SAG, and vocal opponents of the authorities have
 often encountered difficulty in getting visas or passports.
 However, passports were given, for example, to internal
 SWAPO leaders to attend the Geneva meeting in January.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 There are more than forty political parties in Namibia.
 Internal SWAPO continues to operate although it is harassed
 by the authorities and its leaders are periodically de-
 tained. The situation is likely to be complicated further
 if the multi-racial DTA-controlled internal government
 begins utilizing its expanded executive powers to legislate
 for and administer the Territory.

 3. Government Attitude and Record Regarding International
 and Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged
 Violations of Human Rights
 The South African Government's ambiguous attitude toward
 external critics of the Republic's domestic policies is
 reflected in its actions in Namibia. The South Africans
 allow critics of its rule in Namibia, e.g. the Lutheran
 Council, to travel to Namibia and to make contact with the
 various opponents of the regime.
 To some extent, outside pressure is heeded, e.g. in the
 commutation in 1981 of the death sentence of Marcus Kateka,
 who was convicted for complicity in a SWAPO attack on a
 white farmstead. Nonetheless, the basic operation of the
 security system in Namibia is not responsive to outside
 criticism.
 4. Economic and Social Circumstances
 Namibia is a dual society in that a highly developed infra-
 structure exists in conjunction with a traditional African
 society. While the division is no longer fully congruent
 with the racial division in the country, a substantial
 parallelism continues to exist because key governmental
 sectors, e.g. health and education, are under the control
 of the ethnically based "second-tier' governments. Thus,
 the substantial differential in services provided to black
 and white Namibians in the past has not been fundamentally
 changed.
 The population of Namibia is between one and 1.25 million
 people, 90 percent of whom are African and colored and 10
 percent of whom are white. Literacy figures are 100 per-
 cent for whites and 30 percent for blacks, with school
 attendance following roughly the same configuration. GNP
 (1978 estimate) is approximately $1.4 billion with an annual
 growth rate of 2.5 - 3 percent and a per capita income of,
 roughly, $1,400. The per capita income figure belies the
 structure of the economy, however, which is sharply divided
 along racial lines between a modern market sector and a
 traditional subsistence sector. The economic outlook, at
 this point, is less optimistic than it has been, given a
 long-term drought, overfishing and soft world demand for
 Namibia's three principal mineral resources--diamonds,
 copper and uranium.
