 ECUADOR
 An elected, constitutional government was inaugurated
 in Ecuador on August 10, 1979, after nine years of
 extraconstitutional government. The government is
 composed of a President, Jaime Roldos, a Chamber of
 Representatives elected for a five-year term, and a
 judiciary named by the Chamber of Representatives.
 Local government is composed of elected provincial
 and municipal councils. The government has a strong
 stated commitment to the defense of human rights, both
 internally and internationally. Since its inauguration,
 habeas corpus, trade union rights and full freedom
 of the press have been restored.
 Ecuador has a per capita income of $770 (1977). National
 income is maldistributed and large sectors of the population,
 particularly in the rural areas, do not fully participate
 in the economic and political life of the country.
 The present government, however, was elected on a platform
 of socio-economic reform and has committed itself to
 promoting social justice and a more equitable distribution
 of the national wealth, while also following sound
 economic policies.
 1.   Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a.   Torture
 The Constitution that entered into effect on August
 10, 1979, prohibits torture, inhuman or degrading treat-
 ment, and the death penalty. Although the Constitution
 in force until that time contained similar prohibitions,
 beatings of prisoners by police reportedly occurred
 often. There were also reports of the use of electric
 cattle prods. There were unsubstantiated reports of
 the use of other forms of torture. In late 1978 and
 early 1979 there were several specific reports of torture.
 (1) At the end of 1978, three Ecuadorean citizens
 who had been arrested along with eight US citizens
 on suspicion of illegal excavation for pre-Colombian
 artifacts were reportedly mistreated severely while
 in police custody.
 (2) In late 1978 and early 1979 several international
 human rights organizations, including Amnesty Interna-
 tional and the International Work Group for Indigenous
 Affairs, denounced the alleged gross mistreatment and
 illegal detention by local officials in Morona-Santiago
 Province of members of a Shuara (Jivaro) Indian family
 who were under investigation for the murder of a white
 cattle dealer. In response to inquiries about the
 reported abuses, officials of the previous government
 promised an investigation, but the results of that
 investigation, if it was carried out, were not reported.
 Since the inauguration of the constitutional government
 in August 1979 there have been no reports of torture
 or of mistreatment bordering on torture.
 b.   Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 
 
 308
 The Constitution states that the objective of the country's
 penal institutions is the re-education and social rehabilitation
 of the convict. In practice, however, the standards
 of Ecuadorean prisons are uneven and, at times, unsatisfactory.
 Prison officials determine the form of imprisonment,
 which can range from relatively comfortable private
 cells or detention in a medical facility to extended
 confinement in "bullpens" without sleeping, bathing,
 or sanitary facilities. Arrested persons are often
 placed together, without regard to whether they are
 juveniles or hardened criminals, and must provide their
 own food. Prisoners are permitted to receive visits
 and supplies from their families; sometimes they are
 granted furloughs by the prison authorities. Attorneys
 and organizations such as the Red Cross are also permitted
 access to prisoners.
 The new government has taken some steps to rectify
 prison abuses. In October 1979, after the Under Secre-
 tary of Government visited the Esmeraldas Provincial
 Prison and verified reports of mistreatment of prisoners,
 the prison warden and four guards were removed. The
 four guards were also criminally charged in the death
 of an inmate. The former Director of the Garcia Moreno
 Prison in Quito was discharged, reportedly for having
 sold beds and other items intended for the inmates.
 Most of the guards at the Garcia Moreno Prison have
 been replaced, and the beating of prisoners by guards
 reportedly has ceased.
 c.   Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 There are no political prisoners in Ecuador. Under
 the previous government there were occasional cases
 of arbitrary arrest and detention without charges,
 usually for what the authorities considered slanders
 against the government or government officials. Among
 these were the cases of: two labor leaders held without
 charges for seven and four days, respectively, in October
 1978; twelve labcr and political leaders arrested and
 sentenced by a police judge to between six and fifteen
 days in prison in February 1979 for organizing an illegal
 rally; journalists Francisco Salazar Ramirez, sentenced
 by a police judge to ten days in prison in January
 1979 for slandering the Armed Forces, and Cyrano Tama,
 arrested in March 1979, also on slander charges, but
 released after two weeks, before being brought to trial;
 and two retired military officers, one of whom was
 tried by military court and sentenced to two years
 in prison for "crimes against public administration,"
 although his error appears to have been criticizing
 the military government. The two officers were released
 before the inauguration of the new government in August
 1979.
 Cases of detention without charges in non-political
 cases appear to have been frequent under previous governments.
 The right to habeas corpus, suspended under the previous
 regime, has been restored. There are no provisions
 in the law for preventive detention. There has been
 only one claimed "disappeared" in Ecuador. In June
 1979, a mother denounced the disappearance of her son,
 
 
 309
 whom she claimed to be in the hands of the military.
 There have been no subsequent public reports on this
 case. The young man had not reappeared by the time
 this report was prepared.
 d.   Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The Constitution establishes the right to due process.
 It states that no one shall be tried by extraordinary
 courts or ad hoc commissions, penalized without a trial,
 deprived of the right to counsel, forced to testify
 against himself or close relatives, or deprived of
 freedom without a written order from a competent author-
 ity. It also provides .that a person shall be informed
 immediately upon arrest of the charges against him,
 and that trials shall be public, except in the cases
 determined by law. Under the previous regime, defendants
 were not always made aware of the charges against them,
 nor, in political cases, were they always tried in
 ordinary courts. A,1977 decree, repealed by the Chamber
 of Representatives in August 1979, permitted summary
 trials before police officials of persons accused of
 participating in illegal strikes. Under military law,
 in force until the advent of the new government, civilians
 could be tried by military courts. The two retired
 officers referred to in the previous section were tried
 by military courts. Journalist Cyrano Tama was arraigned
 before a military court, but was released on humanitarian
 grounds before his trial could proceed. The independence
 of the courts under the previous regime was widely
 questioned. Former Supreme Court President Gonzalo
 Karolys acknowledged in February 1979 that he had provided
 advice to a member of the government. The former Supreme
 Court's refusal to accept jurisdiction in the case
 of the murder of ex-presidential candidate Abdon Calderon
 was widely believed to have been a political decision.
 There have been no summary executions in Ecuador.
 e.   Invasion of the Home
 The Constitution protects the inviolability of the
 home, stating that "no one may enter a home to carry
 out inspections or searches without the authorization
 of the resident, or without a Judicial Warrant, in
 the cases and manner prescribed by law." A similiar
 prohibition was theoretically in force before the adop-
 tion of the present constitution. Although there have
 been occasional police intrusions without benefit of
 warrant, high-level officials and judicial authorities
 do not condone such acts.
 2.   Government Policies Relating to the Fulfillment
 of Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care
 and Education:
 Ecuador has a predominantly private enterprise, market
 economy. The Constitution recognizes four sectors:
 public, private, mixed and communitary (worker-owned
 enterprises). The Constitution maintains that property
 has a social function, which it defines as increasing
 and redistributing income.  National income, however,
 is maldistributed and large sectors of the population,
 
 
 310
 particularly in the rural areas, do not fully participate
 in the economic, social and political life of the country.
 Ecuador's leaders have, however, made considerable
 efforts to fulfill the economic and social needs of
 their people. During the past few years, rural health
 and sanitation services have been expanded considerably.
 Limited numbers of low-cost dwellings have been constructed,
 although not in sufficient numbers to meet demand.
 The Roldos government has recognized housing as a long-
 range problem, and has announced that it would give
 priority to improving conditions in shantytowns and
 rural areas. Educational opportunities have been expanded,
 with low cost or free education provided through university
 level. However, many poor Ecuadoreans, particularly
 in the rural areas, forego education in order to seek
 gainful employment at an early age. In his inaugural
 speech, President Roldos stressed the need to link
 education to economic development, to promote technical,
 industrial, and agricultural education, and to eradicate
 illiteracy. Basic foodstuffs are sold at subsidized
 prices, bringing them within the reach of all sectors.
 Boosted by the rapid exploitation of oil resources
 from 1972 onwards, Ecuador's annual rate of growth
 averaged 8.6 percent during 1970-77. By 1978 the petroleum-
 induced boom was tapering off and the rate of growth
 decelerated to 6.8 percent. In 1978 the inflation
 rate was about 12 percent.
 In his inaugural address, President Roldos said that
 his government would be deeply committed to policies
 seeking social change and an improved quality of life
 for all Ecuadoreans, but he warned against expecting
 miracles. Recent legislation has included: an increase
 in the minimum wage, establishment of the 40 hour work
 week, and the free importation of pharmaceuticals (to
 lower prices of medicines).
 While there have been allegations of corruption by
 officials of the previous regime, it is not possible
 to determine to what extent corruption hindered fulfillment
 of basic human needs.
 3.   Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Includ-
 ing:
 a.   Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and
 Assembly
 The Constitution protects freedom of speech and freedom
 of expression through any communications medium, freedom
 of religion, the right to petition the government,
 the right of association, and the right of assembly
 for peaceful purposes.
 Under the previous government there were no formal
 controls over the press, but the authorities occasionally
 took action against publications or individuals who
 made statements which the authorities considered defamatory.
 In 1979, as noted in section 1. c., two journalists
 were arrested on charges of slandering the armed forces.
 In March 1979 the publication Nueva was closed down
 
 
 311
 for making allegations of official corruption which,
 according to the government, were unsubstantiated.
 There has been no evidence of any restriction on freedom
 of the press since the inauguration of the Roldos government.
 Nueva reappeared in September 1979.
 There is no established religion in Ecuador, and Ecuador-
 eans are free to practice the religion of their choice.
 Foreign missionaries operate freely.
 Street rallies require prior government consent, which
 is normally forthcoming. In February 1979, however,
 the police broke up an unauthorized "hunger march"
 organized by leftist political parties and labor unions.
 Numerous arrests were made. There are no restrictions
 on indoor meetings.
 Ecuador's active trade union movement has legal rights
 to organize, strike, bargain collectively, and lobby.
 Labor legislation tends to favor workers over employers.
 Public employees, however, are not permitted to strike.
 In August 1979 the Chamber of Representatives repealed
 decrees issued by the previous government which had
 authorized summary trials before police judges of persons
 accused of participating in illegal strikes, and which
 had restricted the unions' right to bargain collectively.
 The Chamber also voted to legalize the National Teachers'
 Union, which had-been deprived of its legal status
 in the wake of the May 1977 strike.
 b.   Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel and Emigration
 There are no internal or external travel restrictions.
 Ecuadoreans may emigrate freely.
 c.   Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Ecuador has a democratic, multiparty political system.
 Municipal and provincial elections and a presidential
 primary were held in July 1978, and presidential and
 legislative elections in April 1979. Political parties
 function free of restrictions, but a party may be deprived
 of its legal status if it fails in two consecutive
 elections to receive a minimum percentage of the vote
 or to field candidates in a stipulated number of provinces.
 In 1979 three political parties were dissolved for
 failing to meet these conditions. Participation in
 the political process is open to all citizens, although
 there are certain restrictions on office-holding.
 All literate citizens over 18 years of age are required
 by law to vote, and can be fined if they fail to do
 so.
 Under Ecuador's constitution, women enjoy the same
 rights and opportunities as men in all aspects of public,
 private, and family life. While tradition and custom
 limit to a large degree women's role and opportunities
 in society, discrimination in Ecuador runs more along
 social class than along gender lines. Women's participation
 'in politics has traditionally been limited, but it
 is increasing. In August 1979 President Roldos appointed
 the first woman cabinet minister in Ecuador's history.

 4.   Government Attitude and Record Regarding Inter-
 national and Non-governmental Investigation of
 Alleged Violations of Human Rights:
 Both the present and the previous governments have
 been active defenders of human rights in international
 organizations. In his inaugural speech, President
 Roldos stated that violations of human rights and consti-
 tutional guarantees create pockets of domestic resistance
 and threaten hemispheric peace. There have been no
 reports of any international or non-governmental group
 being prevented from investigating reports of human
 rights abuses in Ecuador. Under the previous government,
 an Amnesty International and International Work Group
 for Indigenous Affairs representative travelled to
 Morona-Santiago Province to investigate the reported
 mistreatment of members of a Shuara Indian family (see
 Section 1. a.). He was permitted to see two of the
 prisoners and to record their testimony.
 Ecuador is a party to the American Convention on Human
 Rights and is a member of the Organization of American
 States' Juridical-Political Committee which oversees
 human rights efforts in the hemisphere.
