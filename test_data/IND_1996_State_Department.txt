 INDIA
 India is a lonstanig parliamentary democracy with a bicameral parliament.
 Prime Minister H. D. Deve Gowda, whose United Front (UF) a  heads a 13-mem-
 ber parliamentary coalition, took office in June and heads the Government. Presi-
 dent Shanlcar Dayal Sharma, who was elected by an electoral college made up of
 members of parliament and members of state assemblies, is Head of State and also
 has special emergency powers. The judiciary is independent.
 Although the 25 state governments have primary responsibility for maintaining
 law and order, the central government provides guidance and support through use
 of paramilitary forces throughout the country. The Union Ministry for Home Affairs
 controls most of the paramilitary forces, the internal intelligence bureaus, and the
 nationwide plice service; it provides training for senior police officers for the state-
 organized police forces. The armed forces are under civilian control. Security forces
 have committed significant human rights abuses, particularly in Jammu and Kash-
 mir.
 India has a mixed economy. The private sector is predominant in agriculture,
 most nonfinancial services, consumer goods manufacturing, and some heavy indus-
 try. Economic liberalization and structural reforms begun in 1991 continued largely
 unchanged despite a change of government. The economic problems are compounded
 by rapid population growth of 2 percent per year with a current total well above
 900 million. Income distribution remained very unequal. Forty percent of the urban
 ppulation and half the rural population live below the poverty level.
 There continue to be significant human rights abuses, despite extensive constitu-
 tional and statutory safeguards. Many of these abuses are generated by intense so-
 cial tensions, violent secessionist movements and the authorities' attempts to re-
 press them, and deficient police methods and training. These problems are acute in
 Kashmir, where the judicial system has been disrupted by terrorist threats includ-
 ing the assassination of judges and witnesses, by judicialtolerance of the Govern-
 ment's heavy handed antinulitant tactics, and by the refusal of security forces to
 obey court orders. A decrease in abuses by security forces in Kashmir coincided with
 increased abuses by progovernment countermilitants.
 Serious human rights abuses include: Extrajudicial executions and other political
 killings and excessive use of force by security forces; torture, rape, and deaths of
 suspects in police custody throughout the country; poor prison conditions; arbitrary
 arrest and incommunicado detention in Kashmir and the Northeast; continued de-
 tention throughout the country of thousands arrested under special security legisla-
 tion; prolonged detention while under trial; widespread intercaste and communal vi-
 olence; le  an  societal discrimination as well as extensive violence, both societal
 and by police and other agents of government, against women; discrimination and
 violence against indigenous people and schedule castes and tribes; child prostitu-
 tion; and widespread exploitation of indentured, bonded, and child labor.

 During 1996 India made further progress in resolving human rights problems.
 Following state elections in September and October, elected government was re-
 stored in Jammu and Kashmir for the first time in 6 years. Insurgency-related
 deaths were at the same level as last year, although the proportion of civilian
 deaths increased slightly apparently due to militant efforts to prevent elections and
 disrupt the newly elected government. State elections were also held in Uttar
 Pradesh but results failed to resolve a political impasse and President's Rule was
 extendea for an additional 6 months. In Punjab serious abuses of the early 1990's
 were acknowledged and condemned by the Supreme Court. Visits by international
 human rights groups, as well as continuing International Committee of the Red
 Cross (ICRC) prison visits in Kashmir demonstrated increased transparency on
 human rights problems. The National Auman Rights Commission (NHRC) contin-
 ued to enlarge its useful role in addressing patterns of abuse, as well as specific
 abuses. The NHRC helped foster human rights eduation among the police and se-
 curity forces, and advanced its program of human rights education in the schools.
 Separatist militants were responsible for numerous serious human rights abuses,
 including extrajudicial executions and other political *ilings, torture, and brutality.
 Separatist militants were also responsible for kidnaping and extortion in Kashmir
 and Northeast India.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing Political killings by government forces
 (including  deaths in  custody  and  faked  encounter killings), progovernment
 countermilitants, and insurgents continued at a high level in the state of Jammu and
 Kashmir and the seven northeastern states, where separatist insurgencies continued.
 Security forces committed an estimated 100-200 extrajudicial killings of suspected
 militants in Kashmir. Although well-documented evidence to corroborate cases and
 uantify trends is lacking, most observers believe the number of killings declined
 rom previous years. However, the decline was at least partially offset by an in-
 creased number of killings by progovernment countermilitants. Acoring to press
 reports and anecdotal accounts, those killed typically had been detained by security
 forces, and their bodies, bearing multiple bullet wounds and often marks of torture,
 were returned to relatives or were otherwise discovered the saine day or a few days
 later. Security forces claim that these killings, when acknowledged at all, occur in
 armed encounters with militants. Members of the security forces are rarely held ac-
 countable for these killings.
 Throughout the country, numerous accused criminals continue to be killed in en-
 counters with police. Police personnel were wounded in a number of cases, however,
 and such incidents do not appear to reflect a pattern of extrajudicial execution. The
 most recent statistics, for 1995, show that 525 civilians and 159 police died in ex-
 changes of gunfire involving police.
 While extrajudicial killings continued in areas buffeted by separatist insurgencies,
 the press and judiciary continued to give attention to deaths in police custody and
 faked encounter killings elsewhere. According to NHRC statistics, 136 persons died
 in police custody in the year ending March 31. Many such persons were tortured
 (see Section 1.c.). The N C has focused on torture and deaths in custody. It has
 directed district magistrates to report all deaths in police and judicial custody and
 stated that failure to do so will be interpreted as an attempted coverup. Magistrates
 apppear to be complying with this directive. However, the NHRC has no authority
 directly to investigate abuses by the security forces, and security forces are therefore
 not required to-and do not-report custodial deaths in Kashmir or the Northeast.
 In February 24-year-old union leader Ram Gopal died in Faridabad while under-
 go ing police interrogation on a theft charge. Charges related to the death were
 brought against a plice inspector and the owner of a factory where the unionist
 was active. In July liquor dealer Debu Pramanik died after being detained and beat-
 en by police in West Bengal, reportedly in revenge for selling liquor that sickened
 a policeman. In January the Supreme Court ordered prosecution of 27 Punjab po-
 licemen for abduction, illegal confinement, and murder of 4 suspected militants in
 a January 1994 incident described at the time as an encounter. Over 300 persons
 died in prison, many from natural causes, in some case aggravated by poor prison
 conditions (see Section 1.c.).
 Killings  and  abductions  of suspected   militants  and  other persons   by
 progovernment countermilitants emerged as a significant pattern in Kashmir.
 Countermilitants are former separatist militants who have surrendered to govern-
 ment forces but have retained their arms and paramilitary organization. Some ob-
 servers number them at several thousand strong, but the precise figure is unknown.
 
 
 1437
 They committed an estimated 100 to 200 political killings in Kashmir although this
 figure is speculative. For example, on M-arch 20 journalist Sheikh dhulam Rasool
 was abducted from his home by countermilitants reportedly angered by a news re-
 port criticizing their activities; Rasool's body was found in the Jhelum river a month
 later. There are credible reports that government agencies fund, exchange intel-
 ligence  with, and  direct operations of countermilitants as    part of the
 counterinsurgency effort. Countermilitants are known to screen passersby at road-
 blocks and guard extensive areas of the Kashmir Valley from attacks by militants.
 In sponsoring and condoning countermilitant activity, which takes place outside the
 legal system, the Government cannot avoid responsibility for abductions, murders,
 and other abuses by these irregulars.
 In March countermilitants believed to be fronting for the Rashtriya Rifles para-
 military force abducted lawyer and human rights activist Jalil Andrabi from his car
 in Srinigar. (At least one eyewitness alleged that paramilitary soldiers participated
 directly in the abduction, but testimony on this point was inconsistent.) Andrabi was
 preparing to attend the U.N. Human Rights Commission in Geneva at the time of
 his abduction. His body, displaying marks of torture, was later discovered in the
 Jhelum river. Five countermilitants believed to be the abductors were found dead
 a month later. A court-directed investigation into Andrabi's abduction and murder
 was stymied when the Rashtriya Rifles did not respond to the court's request for
 assistance and denied investigators access to witnesses. However, the investigation
 continues and appears at year's end to be makin  progress. countermilitants also
 killed human rights monitor Parag Kumar Das in Assam in May.
 As a result of terrorism aimed at preventing the holding of parliamentary and
 state assembly elections and, later, at disruptin and discrediting the newly elected
 state government, the proportion of civilian deats in insurgency-related violence in-
 creased compared with 1995, although the total number of deaths was little
 changed. On October 23, two persons were killed by a car bomb outside the assem-
 bly members' hostel in Srinagar. In December 3 persons were killed and 40 injured,
 including a state assembly member, when a militant opened fire on and threw a
 grenade into a political meeting in Kulgam Towq. Newly elected chief minister
 Farooq Abdullah had been expected to visit Kulgam on the day of the attack and
 was the apparent target of two other grenade or bomb attacks in which several peo-
 ple were injured. Earlier in the year, terrorists were responsible for a number of
 mass killings of non-Muslims: In January 15 members of the Hindu community in
 the Dada district were abducted and later killed by terrorists; in May a group of
 8 guest workers from Nepal were abducted near Srinagar and killed a few hours
 later, and in July another group of 10 nan-Kashmiri lab~orrs were shot and killed
 near Kupwara.
 The total number of deaths in Kashmir was little changed compared with the
 total in 1995, although the proportion of civilian deaths increased. Reliable press re-
 ports indicate that 1,214 civilians, 94 security force personnel, and 1,271 militants
 died in insurgency-related violence in Kashmir in 1996. 1995 figures were 1,050 ci-
 vilians, 202 security force personnel and 1,308 militants. The decrease in security
 forces deaths apparently reflects the increased role of countermilitants. Nongovern-
 ment organization (NGO) and other sources agree that civilian deaths attributed to
 security forces have decreased. Press reports indicate that the increase in civilian
 deaths is attributable to militant efforts to disrupt elections and the new govern-
 ment.
 Prior to 1995, Andhra Pradesh police engaged in numerous encounter killings of
 Maoist Revolutionary Naxalites. Few such incidents were reported in 1995 and
 1996, when the state unilaterally refrained from many enforcement actions. This re-
 straint ended in August when, in response to continued Naxalite violence, the state
 reimposed a ban on the group. Although police did threaten to "liquidate" two
 human rights monitors (see Section 4), there were no reports that police had re-
 turned to previous patterns of abuse.
 Killings by the Naxalites increased substantially after August. In November 13
 policemen were killed in a Naxalite attack on a police station, and a deputy super-
 intendent of police, his wife, and three others were killed by a Naxalite land mine.
 Also active in Bihar, Orissa, and West Bengal, Naxalites dispensed summary justice
 in "people's courts," which in some cases condemned to death suspected police n-
 farmers, village headmen, and others as "class enemies" and "caste oppressors." In
 one such incident near Visakhapatnam, Andhra Pradesh in November, 13 Naxalites
 reportedly dragged a teacher from his home and cut his throat. In January in the
 Karimnagar district of Andhra Pradesh, five Naxalites and four civilians died in a
 shootout after police surrounded a people's court. In Bihar four policemen were
 killed in January in an attack on a police station in the Gaya district.
 
 
 1438
 There were many allegations that military and paramilitary forces in the North-
 east engage in arbitrary detention, abduction, torture, and extrajudicial execution
 of militants, as well as rape (see Sections I.e. and 1.g.). According to human rights
 group, abuses in the Northeast are similar to those in Kashmir, though perhaps on
 a lesser scale. In Assam countermilitants have from time to time conducted aduc-
 tions and killings, as exemplified in 1996 by the Parag Kumar Das killing (see
 below.) However, precise information on human rights violations in this relatively
 remote region is rare. Extensive, complex patterns of violence continued in the
 seven states of northeastern India. Numerous killings can be attributed to conflicts
 in each of the following categories:Between indigenous people, usually Buddhist or
 animist, and immigrant groups, usually Muslim or Hindu; between tribes of indige-
 nous people; between security forces and militants of I or more of at least 17 insur-
 gent groups; and among factions of insurgent groups.
 Violence escalated in Assam following the death of the former chief minister in
 Ma and a change of government after elections in the same month. Between May
 andthe end of August, more than 150 people were killed in the state. Bodo tribal
 militants and United Liberation Front of Assam (ULFA) insurgents killed 15 mem-
 bers of the security forces. Bodos also killed more than 50 members of the Santal
 minority and rendered roughly 200,000 homeless in a "cleansing" operation of Bodo-
 dominated areas.
 In May ULFA claimed responsibility for killing the superintendant of police of the
 Tinsukhia district of Assam, together with his bodyguard and driver. Journalist
 Parag Kumar Das, known to be close to ULFA, was shot and killed a day later, al-
 legedly by progovernment former ULFA gunmen.
 In Nagaland in December, Naga militants killed 29 members of the rival Kuki
 tribal group and injured 29 others in an attack on a bus. In Tripura, also in Decem-
 ber, tribal militants reportedly belonging to the National Liberation Front of
 Tripura killed 25 Bengali villagers and wounded 30. Tripura tribal militants also
 killed seven paramilitaryersonnel in an ambush in December.
 b. Disappearance According to human rights groups, unacknowledged, incommuni-
 cado detention of suspected militants continued in Kashmir although the practice
 again decreased compared with previous years. The Government acknowledges that,
 as of December, it held 2,070 persons in connection with the insurgency in 5 deten-
 tion centers in Jammu and Kashmir. Of these, 1,298 were held under the Public
 Safety Act and 772 under other laws, including the Terrorist and Disruptive Activi-
 ties Act. Several thousand others are held in short-term confinement in transit and
 interrogation centers.
 Human rights groups maintain that as many as 3,000 more are held by the mili-
 tary and paramilitary forces in long-term unacknowledged detention in interroga-
 tion centers and transit camps nominally intended for only short-term confinement.
 The Government maintains that screening committees run by the state govern-
 ment provide information about detainees to their families. However, other sources
 indicate that families are able to confirm the detention of their relatives only by
 bribing prison guards. A program of prison visits by the ICRC, which began in Octo-
 ber 1995, is designed in part to help assure communications between detainees and
 their families. All acknowledged detention centers in Kashmir and Kashmiri detain-
 ees elsewhere in the country have been visited. The ICRC is not authorized access
 to interrogation centers or transit centers.
 In Punjab the pattern of disappearances prevalent in the early 1990's appears to
 be at an end. Hundreds of lice and security officials have not been held account-
 able for serious human rig ts abuses committed during the counterinsurgency of
 1984-94. However, steps have been taken against a few such violators. In January
 the Supreme Court ordered the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBD to prosecute
 27 Punjab policemen in connection with the alleged encounter killing of 4 suspected
 militants in Gurdaspur in January 1994. The Court stated that, on the basis of a
 CBI report, there appeared to be prima facie cases against some police in the abduc-
 tion and illegal confinement and against all 27 for conspiracy to murder.
 The Supreme Court, acting on a report of the CBI ordered by the Court, in July
 directed the Punjab state government to permit prosecution of a superintendant of
 police and eight other policemen for the September 5, 1995 abduction of human
 rights activist Jaswant Singh Khalra. The Court also ordered that compensation be
 paid to Khalra's wife.
 Khalra had been investigating reports that police in the Tarn Taran district had
 secretly disposed of bodies of suspected militants believed to have been abducted
 and extrajudicially executed. In connection with its report on Khalra's abduction,
 the CBI reported that 984 unidentified bodies were cremated by Punjab police in
 the Tarn Taran district. Supreme Court justices, reportedly expressing horror and
 shock at this report, ordered that the CBI continue its investigation and that the
 
 
 1439
 state government turn over relevant information. Although the CBI report has not
 been made public, a magazine reported that CBI confirmed that 1,683 unclaimed
 bodies were cremated by police in the Tarn Taran district alone between 1984 and
 1995. Of these, 698 were identified but not claimed by relatives. Of the 985 uniden-
 tified bodies: 407 were reportedly killed by border security forces while trying to
 cross into India from Pakistan, many of whom were probably militants; 291 were
 subsequently identified; 84 died by drowning, in road accidents or by suicide; and
 70 reportedly died in clashes between militant factions. Implicitly 133 were uniden-
 tified militants killed in the interior of the district. Police reportedly filed "first in-
 formation reports" (FIR) accounting for each of the bodies. These numbers testify
 to the extent of the bloodshed during those years and, given the pattern of police
 abuses prevalent during the period, credibly include many killed in extrajudicial
 executions.
 There are credible reports that police throughout the country often do not file re-
 quired arrest reports. As a result, there are hundreds of unsolved disappearances
 in which relatives claim an individual was taken into police custody and never
 heard from again. Police usually deny these claims, countering that there are no
 records of arrest.
 Militants in Kashmir and the Northeast continued to use kidnapings to sow ter-
 ror, seek the release of detained comrades, and extort funds. According to the Gov-
 ernment, as of July 31 terrorists in Kashmir kidnaped 418 persons in 1996--com-
 pared with 548 for all of 1995-of which 222 were killed by their captors. The July
 1995 kidnaping of American, British, German, and Norwegian nationals by terror-
 ists remains unresolved. The Norwegian captive was beheaded in August 1995. A
 captured terrorist stated that the remaining hostages--one American, two Britons,
 and a German-were murdered by their captors in December 1995. There has been
 no reliable evidence that they are alive since the fall of 1995. In the northeast state
 of Tripura, militants kidnaped 22 persons during January alone, including a state
 legislator. According to the Government, Tripura militants kidnaped 366 persons
 during 1995, of whom 20 are known to have been killed and 35 are unaccounted
 for. In Assam Bodo militants kidnaped the son of a state minister in February and
 a few days later killed a businessman who had been kidnaped for ransom in Janu-
 ary.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The law prohibits torture, and confessions extracted by force are generally inadnmis-
 sible in court. Nevertheless, there is credible evidence that torture is common
 throughout India and that the authorities often use torture during interrogations.
 In other instances, they torture detainees to extort money and sometimes as sum-
 mary punishment. The NHRC has called on the Government to sign the 1984 Inter-
 national Convention Against Torture. The new United Front Government vowed
 that it would.
 In 1995 the U.N. Special Rappotur on Torture reported that torture was prac-
 ticed routinely by the army, the Border Security Force, and the Central Reserve Po-
 lice Force against the vast majority of persons arrested for political reasons in
 Jamu and Kashimir. According to the Rapporteur, official investigations into alle-
 gations of toerure, including those that resuted in custodial deaths, were rare. This
 state of affairs did not change. Past practices have included beating, rape, burning
 with cigarettes and hot rods, suspension by the feet, crushing of limbs by heavy roll-
 ers, and electric shocks. Because man alleged torture victims die in custody, and
 others are afraid to speak out, there are few firsthand accounts, although the marks
 of torture have often been found on the bodies of deceased detainees.
 The prevalenc e     of te by police in detention facilities throu out the count r
 is borne out by the number of cases of deaths in police custody (see Section l.a..
 A post mortem examination of a young man who aredin      police custody in August
 reportedly found evidence of 51 external injuries, including burns and 30 injuries
 by a blunt object, and concluded that he had been tortured; police holding him
 claimed that the man died when he jumped from a jeep in an escape attempt.
 According to the U N. Special Rapporteur, torture victims or their relatives have
 reportedly had difficulty in filing compliants because police in Kashmir were issued
 instructions not to file a FIR without permission from higher authorities. In addi-
 tion, Section 7 of the Armed Forces (Jammu and Kashmir) Special Powers Act pro-
 vides that unless a pproval is obtained from the central government, "(n)o prosecu-
 tion, suit, or other legal proceeding shall be instituted *   against ay pon n
 respect of anything  one or purported to be done in exercise of the powers of the
 Act." This provision reported a ows the security forces to act with virtual impu-
 Th~lle rape of persons in custody is part of the broader pattern of custodial abuse.
 Limits placed on the arrest, search, and police custody of women appear effectively
 
 
 1440
 to limit the frequency of rape in custody, although it does occur on occasion. The
 NHRC received reports of only three cases of custodial rape during the 1995-96 fis-
 cal year. The 24-hour reporting requirement applies to custodial rape as well as cus-
 todial death. However, the requirement does not appiy to rape byolicemen outside
 police stations. NGO's claim that rape by police, inc luding custo ial rape, is more
 common than NHRC figures indicate. Although evidence islacking, a larger number
 appears credible, in light of other evidence of abusive behavior by police and the
 likelihood that many rapes go unreported due to a sense of shame. A pattern of cus-
 todial rape by paramilitary personnel allegedly exists in the Northeast (see Section
 1.g.), but is not included in NHRC statistics because it involves military forces.
 Although custodial abuse is deeply rooted in police practices, increased press re-
 porting and parliamentary questions offer evidence of growing public awareness of
 the problem. The NHRC has identified torture and deaths in detention as one of
 its priority concerns. As a result of NHRC investigations during the fiscal year, 22
 police personnel were prosecuted during the fiscal year and 79 were suspended,
 most in both cases due to involvement in custodial abuse. Charges against police
 prosecuted for custodial abuse include murder; in one case in Bihar, six policemen
 were convicted and sentenced to death (the decision is under appeal.)
 Prison conditions are poor. Prisons are grossly overcrowded, often housing over
 three times their designed capacity. The largest class of prisoners typically sleeps
 on bare floors, has inadequate sanitary facilities, and receives inadequate food and
 medical care. Prisoners with privileged status or with the personal or family means
 can supplement what is normally provided. There are three classes of prison facili-
 ties. Prisoners are not classified by the nature of their crimes, but by their standing
 in society. Class "C" prisoners are those who cannot prove they are college grad.
 uates or income taxpayers. Their cells are overcrowded, often have dirt floors, no
 furnisbings, and poor quality food. The use of handcuffs and fetters is common.
 Class "B  prisoners-colege graduates and taxpayers-are held under markedly
 better conditions. Class 'A prisoners are prominent persons, as designated by the
 Government, and are accorded private rooms, visits, and adequate food, which may
 be supplemented by their families. Class "A" prisoners are usually held in govern-
 ment guest houses.
 Overcrowding in jails is severe. According to a statement in Parliament in 1994
 by the Minister of State for Home AffairsNew Delhi's Tihar Jail, considered one
 of the best-run in the country, housed 8,577 prisoners-in facilities designed to hold
 2,487. According to the Minister, 7,505 detainees awaited the completion of their
 trials, while 672 others had been on trial for 3 years or longer. Press reports, state-
 ments in court cases, and statements by government officials indicate that condi-
 tions remained essentially unchanged in 1996.
 Nevertheless, prison conditions are a subject of press reports and court cases and
 have received attention from human rights groups. Press accounts of prison condi-
 tions include reports of sexual abuse of prisoners, the use of prisoners by prison offi-
 cials as domestic servants, the sale of food and milk for prisoners on the black mar-
 ket, the sale of female prisoners to brothels, and the marketing and export of prison-
 made goods. Women constitute 2 to 6 percent of the total prison population, accord-
 ing to the 1987 report of Justice Krishna Aiyer. Although Parliament passed a Chil-
 dren's Act in 1960 to safeguard young prisoners against abuse and exploitation and
 a Juvenile Justice Act in 1986 provides that boys under 16 and girls under 18 are
 not to be held in prison, most states have not implemented these acts. The Supreme
 Court has criticized the state governments for not providing reformatories and sepa-
 rate detention facilities for children.
 With the exception of an agreement with the ICRC for visits to detention facilities
 in Kashmir, the Government does not allow NGO's to monitor prison conditions.
 During the 1995-96 fiscal year, 441 cases of custodial death and three cases of
 custodial rape were reported to the NHRC, including 133 deaths and 3 rapes in po-
 lice custody. (The 308 deaths in judicial custody, occurring in a prison population
 of 155,000, much of which is held for years, include a large proportion of deaths
 from natural causes, in some cases aggravated by poor conditions in prisons. Deaths
 in police custody, which typically occur within hours or days of initial apprehension,
 more clearly imply violent abuse. The NIIRC has no authority to investigate abuses
 by security forces directly, and security forces in Kashmir and the Northeast are not
 required to report custodial deaths to the Commission.)
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Government implemented during the
 early 1980's a variety of special security laws intended to help law enforcement au-
 thorities fight separatist insurgency. There were credible reports of widespread arbi-
 trary arrest and detention under these laws.
 Although one of these laws-the Terrorist and Disruptive Practices (Prevention)
 Act (TADA)-that had been subject to the most extensive abuse lapsed in May 1995,
 
 
 1441
 3,785 persons previously arrested under the act continued to be held in a number
 of states at year's end, and a small number of arrests under TADA continued for
 crimes allegedly committed before the law lapsed. Criminal cases are proceeding
 against most of those still held under TADA, with more than 3,000 charged under
 other laws in addition to TADA. In February the Supreme Court eased bail
 guideliness for persons accused under TADA, taking into account the large backlog
 of cases in special TADA courts.
 The Constitution requires that detainees have the right to be informed of the
 grounds for arrest, have the right to be represented by counsel, and, unless the per-
 son is held under a preventive detention law, the right to appear before a mag-
 istrate within 24 hours of arrest. At this initial appearance, the accused must either
 be remanded for further investigation or released. The Supreme Court has upheld
 these provisions. An accused person must be informed of his right to bail at the time
 of arrest and may, unless he is held on a nonbailable offense, apply for bail at any
 time. The police must file a charge sheet within 60 to 90 days of arrest; if they fail
 to do so, court approval of a bail application becomes mandatory.
 The Constitution permits preventive detention laws in the event of threats to pub-
 lic order and national security. These laws provide for limits on the length of deten-
 tion and for judicial review. Several laws of this type remain in effect.
 The National Security Act (NSA) of 1980 permits detention of persons considered
 security risks; police anywhere in the country (except Kashmir) may detain suspects
 under NSA provisions. Under these provisions the authorities may detain a suspect
 without charge or trial as long as 1 year on loosely defined security grounds. The
 state government must confirm the detention order, which is reviewed by an advi-
 sory board of three high court judges within 7 weeks or arrest. NSA detainees are
 permitted visits by family members and lawyers and must be informed of the
 gund for detention within 5 days (10 to 15 days in exceptional circumstances).
 At year's end, approximately 500 persons continue to be detained under the NSA.
 The Jammu and Kashmir Public Safety Act (PSA) of 1978 covers corresponding
 procedures for that state. Over half of the detainees in Jamrau and Kashmir are
 held under the PSA.
 The court system is overloaded. The result has been the detention of persons
 awaiting trial for periods longer than they would receive if convicted. Prisoners may
 be held months or even years before obtaining a trial date. According to a reply to
 a parliamentary question in July 1994, more than 111,000 criminal cases were
 pending in the Allahabad High Court, the most serious case backlog in the country,
 of which nearly 29,000 caseshad been pending for 5 to 8 years. A statement to Par-
 liament in July, indicated that criminal and civil cases pending before the country's
 high courts numbered nearly 2.9 million in 1995, roughly the same as in 1994 but
 an increase from 2.65 million in 1993.
 The Government does not use forced exile.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Tria.-India has an independent judiciary with strong
 constitutional safeguards. Under a Supreme Court ruling, the Chief Justicein con-
 sultation with his colleagues, has a decisive voice in'selecting judicial candidates.
 The President appoints the judges, and they can serve up to the age of 62 on the
 state high courts and to the age of 65 on the Supreme Court.
 Courts of first resort exist at the subdistrict and district levels. More serious cases
 and appeals are heard in state-level High Courts and by the national-level Supreme
 Court, which also rules on constitutional questions. Subdistrict and district judicial
 magistrates are appointed by state governments. High Court judges are a ppointed
 on the recommendation of the federal Law Ministry, with the advice of the Supreme
 Court, the High Court Chief Justice, and the chief minister of the state usually from
 among district judges or lawyers practicing before the same courts. Supreme Court
 judges are similarly appointed from among High Court judges. The Chief Justice is
 selected on the basis of seniority.
 When legal procedures function normally, they generally assure a fair trial, but
 the process can be drawn out and inaccessible to the poor. Defendants have the
 right to choose counsel from a bar that is fully independent of the Government.
 There are effective channels for appeal at most levels of the judicial system.
 The Criminal Procedure Code provides for an open trial ln most cases, but it al-
 lows exceptions in proceedings involving official secrets, trials in which statements
 prejudicial to the safety of the State might be made, or under provisions of special
 security legislation. Sentences must be announced in public.
 Muslim personal status law governs many noncriminal matters involving Mus-
 lims-including family law, inheritance, and divorce. The Government does not
 interfere in the personal laws of the minority communities, with the result that laws
 that discriminate against women are upheld.
 
 
 1442
 In Kashmir the judicial system barely functions due to threats by militants
 against judges, witnesses, and their family members, because of judicial tolerance
 of the Government's heavy handed antimilitant actions, and the frequent refusal by
 security forces to obey court orders. Courts there are not willing to hear cases in-
 volving terrorist crimes or fail to act expeditiously on habeas corpus cases, if they
 act at all. As a result, there have been no convictions of alleged terrorists in Kash-
 mir since before 1994, even though some militants have been in detention for years.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The po-
 lice must obtain warrants for searches and seizures. In a criminal investigation, the
 police may conduct searches without warrants to avoid undue delay, but they must
 justify the searches in writing to the nearest magistrate with jurisdiction over the
 offense. The authorities in Jammu and Kashmir, Punjab, and Assam have special
 powers to search and arrest without a warrant.
 The Indian Telegraph Act authorizes the surveillance of communications, includ-
 ing monitoring telephone conversations and intercepting personal mail, in case of
 public emergency or "in the interest of the public safety or tranquility." These pow-
 ers have been used by every state government.
 g. Use of Excessive Force and Violations of Humanitarian Law in Internal Con-
 flicts.-Both government forces and militants continue to commit serious violations
 of humanitarian law in the disputed state of Jammu and Kashmir. Between 350,000
 and 400,000 Indian army and paramilitary forces are deployed in Jammu and Kash-
 mir. The Muslim majority population in the Kashmir Valley is caught between the
 repressive tactics of the security forces and acts of wanton violence committed by
 the militants. Under the Jammu and Kashmir Disturbed Areas Act, and the Armed
 Forces (Jammu and Kashmir) Special Powers Act, both passed in July 1990, secu-
 rity forces personnel have extraordinary powers, including authority to shoot sus-
 pected lawbreakers and those disturbing the peace, and to destroy structures sus-
 pected of harboring militants or arms.
 In March paramilitary and police forces clashed with militants who had at-
 tempted to occupy the Hazratbal shrine in Srinagar. Nine militants were killed in
 a gun battle while within the shrine compound. Later, after the militants volun-
 tarily evacuated the shrine, 24 more were killed when security forces surrounded
 houses near the shrine in which the armed militants had taken shelter and opened
 fire with mortars, grenades, and firearms. Those surrounded were offered a chance
 to surrender, but only three women and two children left the houses before firing
 began. The houses were completely destroyed and the militants killed.
 Civilian deaths caused by security forces diminished for the third consecutive year
 in Kashmir. The explanation appears to lie in press scrutiny and public outcry over
 abuses in previous years, increased training of military and paramilitary forces in
 humanitarian law, and greater sensitivity of commanders to rule of law issues. The
 improvement has taken the form of increased discipline and care in avoiding collat-
 eral civilian injuries and deaths (i.e., deaths in crossfire). The security forces have
 not abandoned the abduction and extrajudicial execution of suspected militants,
 much less embraced accountability for these abuses. However, the inclination of
 many commanders to distance their units from such practices has led to diminished
 participation in them and a transfer of some of this role to countermilitants.
 In Manipur in August, the unusual willingness of a victim to speak up sparked
 a massive protest demonstration against a pattern of rape by security force person-
 nel.
 In an effort to sensitize paramilitary forces to human rights problems, the Direc-
 tor General of the Border Security Force and the NIIRC sponsored a debate in Feb-
 ruary on the role of human rights among personnel of all seven paramilitary forces.
 In August the Chief of Army Staff issued revised human rights guidelines for mili-
 tary forces at a seminar on international humanitarian law sponsored by the Army
 Judge Advocate General, in cooperation with the ICRC and the Indian Red Cross.
 Kashmiri militant groups were also guilty of serious human rights abuses. Terror-
 ists attacked politicians in an effort to obstruct national parliamentary elections in
 May and June and state assembly elections in September. In addition to political
 killings and kidnapings (see Sections 1.a. and 1.b.), terrorists engaged in extortion
 and carried out acts of random terror that left hundreds of Kashmiris dead. Terror-
 ist acts by Kashmiri groups have also taken place outside Jammu and Kashmir. A
 Kashmiri terrorist group detonated a bomb at a railway station in New Delhi in
 January, killing 6, and a car bomb in a crowded market in New Delhi in May, kill-
 ing 25. Many of the terrorists are not Indian citizens.
 Kashmiris continued to be caught in the crossfire between militants on one side
 and security forces and countermilitants on the other. Unlike past years, however,
 
 
 1443
 there were no large-scale or prolonged clashes resulting in extensive loss of civilian
 life or property.
 In the Northeast militant violence directed against civilians resulted in numerous
 deaths and drove tousands from their homes.-In an upsurge of violence related to
 a change of elected government in the state, Bodo militants in Assam killed nearly
 50 members of the Santal minority and forced some 200,000 persons to flee their
 homes (see Section L.a.). In Tripura, as of February, repeated militant attacks over
 preceding months had forced more than 10,000 tribals opposed to extremism or
 aligned with the political opposition to flee their homes. A December 30 bomb blast
 on a passenger train in Assam, which left at least 34 dead, was believed to be the
 handiwork of Bodo militants.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for these rights, and
 with some limitations they are exercised in practice. A vigorous press reflects a wide
 variety of public, social, and economic beliefs. Newspapers and magazines regularly
 publish investigative reports and allegations of government wrongdoing, and the
 press as a whole champions human rights and criticizes perceived government
 lapses. The Press Council of India is a statutory body of journalists, publishers, aca-
 demics, and politicians with a chairman appointed by the Government. Designed to
 be a self-regulating mechanism for the press, it investigates complaints of irrespon-
 sible journalism and sets a code of conduct for publishers. This code includes not
 publishing articles or details that might incite caste or communal violence. The
 Council publicly criticizes newsaers or journalists it believes have broken the code
 of conduct, but its findings, while noted by the press community, carry no legal
 weight.
 National television and radio, which are government monopolies, are frequently
 accused of manipulating the news to the benefit of the Government. However, inter-
 national satellite television is widely distributed in middle class neighborhoods by
 cable and is gradually eroding the Government's monopoly on television.
 Under the Official Secrets Act (OSA), the Government ma restrict ublication of
 sensitive stories, but the Government sometimes interprets this bradly to suppress
 criticism of its policies. The 1971 Newspapers Incitements to Offenses Act remains
 in effect in Jammu and Kashmir. Under the act, a district magistrate may prohibit
 the press from carrying material resulting in "incitement to murder" or "any act of
 violence." As punishment the act stipulates that the authorities may seize news-
 papers and printing presses. Despite these restrictions, newspapers in Srinagar reg-
 ularly carry militant press releases attacking the Government and report in detail
 on alleged human rights abuses. The authorities allowed foreign journ  sts to travel
 freely in Kashmir, where they regularly spoke with militant leaders, and filed re-
 ports on government abuse.
 A government censorship board reviews films before licensing them for distribu-
 tion. The board deletes material deemed offensive to public morals or communal
 sentiment. Producers of video news magazines must also submit their products to
 the board, which occasionally censors stories that portray the Government in an un-
 favorable light. The board's ruling may be appealed and overturned. Kashmiri
 groups threatened journalists and editors and even imposed temporary bans on
 some publications. In July 19 journalists were detained by countermilitants, and 6
 were threatened with death. l were released later the same day, following the
 intervention of paramilitary forces. On August 1, Ashraf Shaban, editor of the Urdu
 language Al Safa was abducted and held overnight.
 Citizens enjoy complete academic freedom, and students and faculty espouse a
 wide range of views. In addition to 10 national universities and about 160 state uni-
 versities, states are empowered to accredit locally run private institutions.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 the right of peaceful assembly and the right to form associations, and the Govern-
 ment generally respected these rights in practice.
 The authorities sometimes require permits and notification prior to holding pa-
 rades or demonstrations, but local governments ordinarily respect the right to pro-
 test peacefully. At times of civil tension, the authorities may ban public assemblies
 or impose a curfew under the Criminal Procedure Code. The authorities in Punjab
 frequently imposed such restrictions in previous years but limited their use since
 1994- opposition Akali parties were permitted to hold public rallies and conduct
 membership drives.
 Srinagar and other parts of Jammu and Kashmir were under curfew sporadically
 during much of the year.
 c.lFreedom of Relg ion.-The Constitution provide for freedom of religion, and the
 Government repects this right in practice. India is a secular state in which all faiths
 
 
 1444
 
 generally enjoy freedom of worship. Government policy does not favor any religious
 group. There is no national law to bar proselytizing by Indian Christians. Foreign
 missionaries can generally renew their visas but since the mid-1960's the Govern-
 ment has refused to admit new resident foreign missionaries. Those who arrive now
 do so as tourists and stay for short periods. As of January 1993, there were 1,923
 registered foreign Christian missionaries. As in the past, state officials refused to
 issue permits for foreign Christian missionaries to enter some northeastern states.
 Tension between Hindus and Muslims continue to pose a challenge to the secular
 foundation of the State (see Section 5).
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.--Citizens enjoy freedom of movement within the country except in cer-
 tain border areas where, for security reasons, special permits are required. Under
 the Passports Act of 1967, the Government may deny a passport to any applicant
 who "may or is likely to engge outside India in activities prejudicial to the sov-
 ereignty and integrity of India. The Government uses this provision to prohibit the
 foreign travel of some government critics, especially those advocating Sikh inde-
 pendence.
 Citizens may emigrate without restriction.
 Although India is not a signatory to the U.N. Convention and Protocol on Refu-
 gees, the Government follows its general principles. The Government cooperates
 with the office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) to
 a limited extent in connection with some categories of refugees, specifically those
 who fled Afghanistan. In earlier years the Government accepted a UNHCR role in
 overseeing the repatriation of refugees to Sri Lanka. The Government accepts the
 cooperation of other nongovernmental humanitarian organizations in assisting Ti-
 betan and Sri Lankan refugees. The Government provided first asylum to approxi-
 mately 6,000 additional refugees from renewed fighting in Sri Lanka in 1996. There
 were no reports of forced return of persons to a country where they feared persecu-
 tion.
 The Government recognizes certain groups, including Chakmas from Bangladesh,
 Tamils from Sri Lanka, and Tibetans, as refugees, providing them assistance in ref-
 ugee camps or in resettlement areas. According to a government statement to Par-
 liament in July, there were 98,000 Tibetans, 87,729 Sri Lankan Tamils, 66,234
 Chakmas and Hajongs from Bangladesh, and 52 Burmese refugees. In the state-
 ment, the Government indicated that 18,932 Afghans, 255 Somalis, and 308 persons
 of other nationalities were living in India "under the mandate" of the UNHCR. Al-
 though the Government does not formally recognize persons in this latter category
 as refugees, it does not deport them. Instead, these people receive renewable resi-
 dence permits or their status is ignored.
 No further Chakma refugees were repatriated during 1996, pursuant to a 1993
 agreement with the Government of Bangladesh. Human rights groups claimed that
 the Government reduced rations, medicai care, and cash assistance to refugee camps
 holding Chakmas to encourage them to repatriate. In May the NHRC sent a team
 to investigate conditions in the camps. The team reported a shortage of water, mea-
 ger rations, inadequate accommodations, inadequate medical care, inoperative wells,
 and evidence of malaria, water-borne diseases, and malnutrition among children.
 The NHRC subsequently directed concerned agencies to improve the administration
 of the camps.
 The Supreme Court, in response to a case filed by the NHRC, intervened to pro-
 tect another group of Chakmas who had come to India as refugees in the 1960's.
 The state government of Arunachal Pradesh, where these Chakmas had been set-
 tled, had threatened to remove them forcibly from the state in response to resent-
 ment expressed by the indigenous people.
 According to the UNHCR, as of late November, there were 62,281 Tamil refugees
 from Sri Lanka living in 115 camps in India, including approximately 6,000 who
 fled the upsurge in fighting in Sri Lanka during 1996 and 338 suspected of militant
 activities, who are detained in special camps. An estimated 30-60,000 more Sri
 Lankan Tamils are not registered as refugees and are living outside the camps.
 NGO's report refugee complaints about deteriorated housing, poor sanitation, de-
 layed dole payments, and inadequate medical care. Such complaints notwithstand-
 ing, minimum standards are being met. The state government, using central govern-
 ment resources, provides shelter and subsidized food for those in the camps. En-
 forcement of a Tamil Nadu government ban on NGO assistance to the camps has
 been relaxed and NGO's have visited the camps.
 There are Chin ethnics among nonrecognized refugees in the northeastern states,
 particularly Mizoram. Their presence is generally tolerated. However, recent ten-
 sions between security forces and Chin National Force (CNF) insurgents operating
 
 
 1445
 in Burma have allegedly resulted in detention, interrogation, and expulsion of some
 persons associated with the CNF.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens exercise this right freely. India has a democratic, parliamentary system
 of government with representatives elected in multiparty elections under universal
 adult suffrage. A parliament sits for 5 years unless dissolved earlier for new elec-
 tions, except under constitutionally defined emergency situations. State govera-
 ments are elected at regular intervals except in states under President's Rule, i.e.,
 rule by the central Government.
 On the advice of the Prime Minister, the President may proclaim a state of emer-
 gency in any part of the national territory in the event of war, external aggression,
 or armed rebellion. Similarly, President's Rule may be declared in the event of a
 collapse of a state's constitutional machinery. The Supreme Court in May 1995
 upheld the Government's authority to suspend fundamental rights during an emer-
 gency.
 National elections for the popularly elected lower house of Parliament were held
 in several rounds from late April through June; more than half of the electorate of
 more than 600 million voted. The elections were generally free, fair, and peaceful.
 Repelling was undertaken in a number of polling places where the Election Commis-
 sion suspected significant irregularities, and tightly enforced new restrictions on
 campaign expenditures, wall-painting, and the use of vehicles and loudspeakers
 were credited with enhancing the representative character of these elections.
 State assembly elections were held in Jammu and Kashmir in September, result-
 ing in an end of President's Rule and return to elected government for the first time
 in 6 years. Security forces in some places were seen to coerce members of the public
 to go to polling places, after militants called for a boycott of the elections. Some indi-
 viduals said they welcomed this procedure as a pretext for evading militant retalia-
 tion against voters. Although state assembly elections were held in Uttar Pradesh
 in September and October, results failed to produce any clear majority in the assem-
 bly, and President's Rule was extended for an additional 6 months. This decision
 was subsequently approved by Parliament but was declared unconstitutional by the
 Allahabad High Court in mid-December on grounds that it exceeded the 1-year limit
 on President's Rule set by the Constitution and that all recourse to formation of an
 elected government had not been exhausted. An appeal of the High Court decision
 to the Supreme Court was pending at year's end, and President's Rule continued.
 In Gujarat President's Rule was declared and the assembly suspended in October,
 when the chief minister lost his majority. President's Rule was revoked and the as-
 sembly reconvened when a new government was formed a few weeks later.
 There are no legal impediments to participation by women in the political process.
 A large proportion of women participate in voting throughout the country, and nu-
 merous women represent all major parties in the national and state legislatures.
 There are 57 women in the Parliament, including the deputy speaker of the upper
 house, but only one women in the Cabinet. Thirty percent of seats in elected village
 councils (panchayats) are reserved for women.
 The Constitution reserves seats in Parliament and state legislatures for "sched-
 uled tribes' and "scheduled castes" in proportion to their population (see Section 5).
 Indigenous people participate actively in national and local politics, but their impact
 depends on their numerical strength. In the northeastern states, indigenous people
 are a large proportion of the population and consequently exercise a dominant politi-
 cal influence in the political process. In Maharashtra and Gujarat, on the other
 hand, tribal peoples are a small minority and have been unsuccessful in blocking
 projects they oppose.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Independent human rights organizations operate throughout the country inves-
 tigating abuses and publishing their findings, which are often the basis for reports
 by" international human rights groups. However, the polie have targeted human
 rights monitors for arrest and harassment. In Tamil Nadu, the previous state gov-
 ernment intimidated NGO's, including human rights groups, by enacting a law per-
 mitting the government to take over the management of any such group. Two per-
 sons involved in human rights activities, Jail Aiidrabi in Kashmir and Parag
 Kumar Das in Assam, were killed by soldiers or progoverment counter militants,
 or bth (see Section l.a.). A court-directed investigation of the murder of Andrabi
 was in progress. On October 7 police in Warangal district, Andhra Pradesh, threat-
 ened Dr. Burra Ramulu and Amabati Srinivas, both members of the Andhra
 
 
 1446
 
 Pradesh Civil Liberties Committee, after they called for *udicial inquiries into al-
 legd police abuses against suspected Maoist guerrillas. dn October 9, the Andhra
 Pradesh High Court ordered the state to provide protection for the men.
 The Government appointed a Nationid Human Rights Commission in October
 1993 with powers to mvestigate and recommend policy changes, punishment, and
 compensation in cases of police abuse.
 In addition, the NHRC is directed to contribute to the establishment, growth, and
 finctioning of nongovernmental human rights organizations. The Government ap-
 points the members and finances the operations of the NHRC. Although the NHRC
 is seriously understaffed and prohibited by statute from directly investigating alle-
 gations of abuse involving army and paramilitary forces, the Commission has made
 effective use of indirect inquiries to address abuses by the armed forces.
 During the 1995-96 fiscal year, the NHRC registered 9,751 complaints of human
 rights abuses, as well as 444 cases of custodial death or rape. A total of 1,277 cases
 remained pending from the preceding year. At the end of the fiscal year, 5,984 cases
 had been dismissed, 1,178 dispoesed of with directions," 546 concluded, and 3,535
 remained pending.
 The NHRC organized or participated in several joint programs with NGO's and
 worked with human rights NGO's in its investigation of individual complaints. The
 NHRC has also worked to build a "culture of human rights" by actively encouraging
 the introduction of human rights syllabuses into universities and public schools. In
 March it launched a program to train instructors of teachers in human rights. Six-
 teen hundred instructors are receiving 6 months training on a continuing basis with
 a goal of giving human rights training to all of the country's 1 million teachers at
 the elementary and secondar levels.   C-supported programs are already under-
 way at the university level. In February the N C cosponsored debates by person-
 nel of Indian paramilitary forces on the role of human rights, in what is to be the
 first in an annual series; in December the Commission cosponsored an essay contest
 by police on "custodial crime" and 'The role of police in human rights." It also spon-
 sored human rights education programs for the police and. a seminar in July on
 human rights and terrorism in which senior police officials and NGO representa-
 tives participated. State human rights commissions have been established in West
 Beng, Himachal Pradesh, Assam and Madhya Pradesh. In addition, special courts
 to hear human rights cases have been established in Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh,
 and Andhra Pradesh.
 The NHRC was also involved in programs to eliminate child labor (see Section 6).
 The prison visits program in Kashmir of the International Committee of the Red
 Cross (ICRC), initiated in October 1995, continued through the year. ICRC rep-
 resentatives also continued training police and border security force personnel in
 international humanitarian law. In August the ICRC and Indian Red Cross Society,
 together with the Army's Judge Advocate General, cosponsored a seminar on inter-
 national humanitarian law.
 Several international human rights organizations visited India during the year.
 An Amnesty International (AI) delegation made a month-long visit in July-August,
 the first AI visit since 1992. The team visited Delhi, Karnataka, and Rajasthan but
 was not permitted to visit Kashmir. After discussions with the AT team, (now re-
 tired) NHRC Chairman Ranganath Misra publicly urged that AI be permitted to
 visit the Kashmir valley. A Human Rights Watch researcher visited Kashmir in
 January. U.N. Human Rights Commission Special Rapporteur on Religious Intoler-
 ance Abdul Fateh Amor visited India, including Kashmir, as part of a three-member
 delegation in December.
 An Asia-Pacific human rights NGO congress was held in New Delhi in December,
 attended by delegates from throughout the region.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The traditional caste system as well as differences of ethnicity, religion, and lan-
 guage deeply divide Indian society. Despite laws designed to prevent discrimination
 there are other laws as well as social and cultural practices that have a profound
 discriminatory impact.
 Women.-Domestic violence in the context of dowry disputes is a serious problem.
 In the typical dowry dispute, a groom's family will harass a woman they believe has
 not provided sufficient dowry. This harassment sometimes ends in the woman's
 death, which family members often try to portray as a suicide or kitchen accident.
 Although most "dowry deaths" involve lower and middle-class families, the phe-
 nomnon crosses both caste and religious lines.
 In an answer to a parliamentary question in July, the Government reported that
 5,817 dowry deaths occurred in 1993, 4,936 in 1994, and 4,811 in 1995. Under a
 
 
 1447
 1986 amendment to the Penal Code, the court must presume the husband or the
 wife's in-laws are responsible for every unnatural death of a woman in the first 7
 year of marriage-provided that harassment is proven. In such cases, police proce-
 dures require that an officer of deputy superintendent rank or above conduct the
 investigation and that a team of two or more doctors perform the post mortem pro-
 cedures.
 According to information presented to the Parliament by the Home Ministry in
 July, 6,735 cases of dowry death were before the courts in 1994. Of these, 461 re-
 sulted in conviction, 973 in acquittals, and 212 were compounded or withdrawn.
 This compares with 5,713 cases, 341 convictions, and 647 acquittals in 1993. Sen-
 tences included life imprisonment.
 There is an elaborate system of laws to protect the rights of women, including the
 Equal Remuneration Act, the Prevention of Immoral Traffic Act, the Sati (widow
 burning) Prevention Act, and the Dowry Prohibition Act. However, the Government
 often is unable to enforce these laws, especially in rural areas where traditions are
 deeply rooted. Female bondage and forced prostitution are widespread in parts of
 society. Government statistics show that registered cases of violence against
 women-including molestation, rape, kidnaping, and wife murder (dowry deaths)-
 numbered 83,964 in 1993, 98,948 in 1994 and 100,846 in 1995. There were reports
 during the year of gang rapes as penalties for alleged adultery or as means of coer-
 cion or revenge in rural property disputes and feuds. Higher female mortality at all
 age levels, including female infanticide, accounts for a decline in the ratio of females
 to males to 927 per 1,000 in 1991, from 955 per 1,000 in 1981 and 972 per 1,000
 at the turn of the century.
 The personal status laws of the religious communities discriminate against
 women. Under the Indian Divorce Act of 1869, a Christian woman may demand di-
 vorce only in the case of spousal abuse and certain categories of adultery while for
 a man adultery alone is sufficient. Under Islamic law, a Muslim husband may di-
 vorce his wife spontaneously and unilaterally, there is no such provision for women.
 Islamic law also allows a man to have up to four wives but prohibits polyandry.
 The Hindu Succession Act provides equal inheritance rights for Hindu women, but
 married daughters are seldom given a share in parental property. Islamic law recog-
 nizes a woman's right of inheritance but specifies that a daughter's share should
 be only one-half that of a son.
 Under tribal land systems, notably in Bihar, tribal women do not have the right
 to own land. Other laws relating to the ownership of assets and land accord women
 little control over land use, retention, or sale.
 There are thousands of grassroots organizations working for social justice and eco-
 nomic advancement of women, in addition to the National Commission for Women.
 The Government usually supports these efforts, despite strong resistance from tradi-
 tionally privileged  ups.
 ChIdren.-The Government formed in June made compulsory elementary edu-
 cation and an increase in expenditure on elementary education part of its program.
 The new Government also affirmed its support for the existing program for the
 elimination of child labor, which is aimed at progressively withdrawing children
 from the workplace and placing them in schools by 2000 through initiatives in edu-
 cation, rural development, women and child development, health, and labor pro-
 grams. A Supreme Court decision in December raised penalties for employers of
 children in hazardous industries and establishing a welfare fund for formerly em-
 ployed children. (See Section 6.d.).
 There are an estimated 500,000 street children nationwide. Child prostitution in
 the cities is rampant, and there is a growing pattern of traffic in child prostitutes
 from Nepal. According to one estimate 5,000 to 7,000 children, mostly aged 10 to
 18, are victims of this traffic annually.
 The Child Marriage Restraint (Amendment) Act of 1976 prohibits child marriage,
 a traditional practice in northern India. The act raised the age of marriage for girls
 to 18 from 15, but the Government does not enforce it effectively. According to one
 report, 50 percent of the girls in Bihar, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, and Madhya
 Pradesh are married at or before age 16.
 The traditional preference for male children continues. Although a law passed in
 September 1994 prohibits the use of amniocntesis and sonogram tests for sex deter-
 mination, they are widely misused for this purpose and termination of a dispropor-
 tionate number of pregnancies with female fetuses occurs. Human rights gups es-
 timate that at least 10,000 cases of female infanticide occur yearly, primariy in poor
 rural areas. In addition, parents often give priority in health care and nutrition to
 male infants. Women's rights groups point out that the burden of providing girls
 with an adequate dowry is one factor that makes daughters less desirable. Although
 
 
 1448
 
 abetting or taking dowry is theoretically illegal under the Dowry Prohibition Act of
 1961, it is still widely practiced.
 People with Disabiities.-The Ministry of Welfare has principal responsibility for
 programs for the disabled, and it delivers comprehensive rehabilitation services to
 the rural population through 16 district centers. A national rehabilitation plan com-
 mits the Government to putting a rehabilitation center in each of more than 400
 districts, but services are still concentrated in urban areas. The Government re-
 serves 3 percent of psitions in official offices and state-owned enterprises for people
 with visual, hearing, or orthopedic disablities. The Government provides special
 railway fares, education allowances, scholarships, customs exemptions, and rehabili-
 tation training to assist, people with disabilities. There is no legislation or otherwise
 mandated provision of accessibility for the disabled.
 Indigenous People.-The Innerline Regulations enacted by the British in 1873 still
 provide the basis for safeguarding tribar rights in most of the border states of north-
 eastern India. These regulations prohibit any person, including Indians from other
 states, from going beyond an inner boundary without a valid permit. No rubber,
 wax, ivory, or other forest products may be removed from the protected areas with-
 out prior authorization. No outsiders are allowed to own land in the tribal areas
 without approval from tribal authorities.
 Despite constitutional safeguards, the rights of indigenous gups in eastern India
 are often ignored. There has been encroachment on tribal land in almost all the
 states of eastern India, including by illegal immigrants from Bangladesh and busi-
 nesses that have removed forest and mineral products without authorization. More-
 over, persons from other backgrounds often usurp places reserved for members of
 tribes and lower castes in national education institutions.
 Such violations have given rise to numerous tribal movements demanding protec-
 tion of land and property rights. The Jharkhand Movement in Rihar and Orissa,
 and the Bodo Movement in Assam, reflect deep economic and social grievances
 among indigenous people. In the Jharkhand area, tribal people complain that they
 have been relegated to unskilled mining jobs, have lost their forests to industrial
 construction, and have been displaced by development projects. The Government
 has considered the creation of an independent Jharkand state, but the affected state
 governments oppose the idea.
 However, there is some local autonomy in the northeast. In Meghalaya tribal
 chiefs still wield influence in certain villages. The Nagaland government controls
 the rights to certain mineral resources, and autonomous district councils in Tripura,
 Assam, and Meghalaya control matters such as education, rural development, and
 forestry in cooperation with the state governors.
 National /Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-The Constitution gives the President author-
 ity to specify historically disadvantaged castes and tribes which are entitled to af-
 firmative action in employment and other benefits. These "scheduled" tribes and
 castes benefit from special development funds, government hiring quotas, and spe-
 cial training programs.
 The Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act of 1989
 specifies new offenses against disadvantaged people and provides stiffer penalties
 for offenders. However, this act has had only a modest effect in curbing abuse. Gov-
 ernment statistics indicate that 36,310 cases of abuse were committed against mem-
 bers of scheduled castes and tribes in 1995, compared with 38,927 in 1994. In a par-
 ticularly gruesome incident on June 11, 20 low-caste villagers in the Bihar village
 Barki Kharwan, including pregnant women and children, were massacred by an
 upper caste private militia group. The Home Minister visited the village to inves-
 tigate the incident personally, and 18 policemen were subsequently suspended for
 failing to intervene. A Government commission is charged with giving special atten-
 tion to the problems of the scheduled castes and tribes and submits an annual re-
 port.
 The practice of untouchability was in theory outlawed by the Constitution and the
 1955 Civil Rights Act, but it remains an important aspect of life. Intercaste violence
 claims hundreds of lives each year.
 Religious Minorities.-Controversy between Hindus and Muslims continues with
 regard to three sites where mosques were built centuries ago on sites where temples
 are believed to have previously stood. The potential for renewed Hindu-Muslim vio-
 lence remains considerable. The NHRC undertook to continue investigation of 1992
 Hindu-Muslim violence in Bombay after the Maharashtra state government in Jan-
 uary ordered that a commission of inquiry be disbanded without completing its re-
 port. The commission was reinstated in May.
 The Religious Institutions (Prevention of Misuse) Act makes it an offense to use
 any religious site for political purposes or to use temples for harboring persons ac-
 
 
 1449
 cused or convicted of crime. While specifically designed to deal with Sikh places of
 worship in the Punjab the law applies to all religious sites.
 Fear of political violence drove most Hindus in the Kashmir Valley (Pandits) to
 seek refuge in camps in Jammu or with relatives in New Delhi or elsewhere. The
 Pandit community criticizes bleak conditions in the camps and fears that a nego-
 tiated solution giving greater autonomy to the Muslim majority might threaten its
 own survival in Kashmir as a culturally and historically distinctive group. The
 Pandits were permitted to vote in their districts of origin by absentee ballot in na-
 tional and state elections during the year.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution provides for the right of associa-
 tion. Workers may establish and join unions of their own choosing without prior au-
 thorization. There are five major recognized national trade union centrals, each of
 which is associated with, but not necessarily controlled by, a political party.
 Trade unions often exercise the right to strike, but public sector unions are re-
 quired to give at least 16 days' notice prior to striking. Some states have laws re-
 quiring workers in certain nonpublic sector industries to give prior strike notice.
 The Essential Services Maintenance Act allows the Government to ban strikes
 and requires conciliation or arbitration in specified essential industries. Legal mech-
 anisms exist for challenging the assertion that a given dispute falls within the scope
 of this act. The Industrial Disputes Act prohibits retribution by employers against
 employees involved in legal strike actions. This prohibition is observed in practice.
 Abuses against nationally organized unions or unionized workers are generally
 not a problem. However, unaffiliated unions of low caste or tribal workers are not
 always able to secure for themselve the protections and rights guaranted by law.
 In February the death of a plant-level union leader in police custody, after he had
 been arrested on theft charges brought by his employer (see Section L.a.), was an
 unusual instance of abuse. Charges related to the killing have been brought against
 both the police and the employer.
 Unions are free to affiliate with international trade union organizations.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The right to bargain collec-
 tively has existed for decades. The Trade Union Act prohibits discrimination against
 union members and organizers, and employers may be penalized if they discrimi-
 nate against employees engaged in union activities.
 Collective bargaining is the normal means of setting wages and settling disputes
 in unionized plants in the organized industrial sector. Trade unions vigorously de-
 fend worker interests in this process. Although a system of specialized labor courts
 adjudicates labor disputes there are long delays and a backlog of unresolved cases.
 When the parties are unable to agree on equitable wages, the Government may set
 up boards of union, management, and government representatives to determine
 them.
 In practice legal protections of worker rights are effective only for the 28 million
 workers in the organized industrial sector, out of a total work force of more than
 376 million. Outside the modern industrial sector, laws are difficult to enforce.
 Union membership is rare in this informal sector and collective bargaining does not
 exist.
 There are seven export processing zones (EPZ's). Entry into the EPZ's is ordi-
 narily limited to the employees. Such entry restrictions apply to union organizers.
 While workers in the ElYs have the right to organize and bargain collectively,
 union activity is rare. In addition unions, content with their role in public sector
 enterprises, have not vigorously pursued efforts to organize private-sector employees
 anywhere in the years since EPZ's were established. Women constitute the bulk of
 the work force in the EPZ's.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Constitution prohibits forced
 labor, and legislation passed in 1976 specifically bans the practice of bonded labor.
 A Supreme Court decision defined forced labor as work at less than the minimum
 wage, which is usually set by the state governments. Under this definition, which
 er from that of the International Labor Organization (ILO), forced labor is wide-
 spread, especially in rural areas.
 Bonded labor, the result of a private contractual relationship whereby a worker
 incurs or inherits debts to a contractor and then must work off the debt plus inter-
 est, is illegal but widespread. The Government estimates that between enactment
 of the Bonded Labor (Regulation and Abolition) Act in 1979 and March 31, 1993,
 approximately 251,424 bonded workers had been released from their obligations.
 Other sources maintain that those released are only one-tenth of the total number
 of bonded laborers. State governments are responsible for enforcing the act. Offend-
 ers may be sentenced to up to 3 years in prison but prosecutions are rare.

 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The Constitution prohibits em-
 ployment of children under 14 years of age in factories, mines, or other hazardous
 employment. It also encourages the state governments to provide free and compul-
 sory education for all children up to the age of 14. A law passed in 1986 banned
 the employment of children under age 14 in hazardous occupations, such as glass
 making, fireworks, match factories, and carpet weaving and regulated their employ-
 ment in others. The Factories Act and the Child Labor Registration Act limit the
 hours of workers below the age of 15 to 4.5 hours per day.
 The Government estimates that there were 17.5 million child workers in 1985.
 The ILO estimates the number at 44 million, while NGO's claim that the figure is
 55 million. Interpolation of census figures by the National Labor Institute indicates
 that of a total of 203 million children between the ages of 5 and 14, 116 million
 are in school, 12.6 million are in full time employment, and the status of 74 million
 is unknown. Most, if not all of the 87 million children not in school do housework,
 work on family farms, work alongside their parents as paid agricultural labor, work
 as domestic servants, or are otherwise employed.
 The enforcement of child labor laws is the responsibility of the state governments.
 Enforcement is not effective, especially in the informal sector where most of the chil-
 dren are employed. The continuing prevalence of child labor may be attributed to
 social ai ceptance of the practice and the failure of the state governments to make
 primary school education compulsory.
 The new national Government formed in June has continued a comprehensive
 plan to eliminate child labor from hazardous industries by the year 2000. This pro-
 gram, for which approximately $260 million has been budgeted, includes enhanced
 enforcement of child labor laws, income supplements for families, subsidized school
 lunches in areas where child labor is concentrated, and a public awareness cam-
 paign. Recognizing a need to ensure that primary education is made universal and
 compulsory by state governments, the new Government committed itself to making
 primary education a fundamental constitutional right, not merely a directive prin-
 ciple. It has also pledged to raise educational expenditures to 6 percent of the budg-
 et and to spend at least 50 percent of this amount on primary education. The
 NHRC, continuing its own child labor agenda, organized NGO programs to provide
 special schooling, rehabilitation, and family income supplements for children in the
 glass industry in Firzabad. The NHRC also intervened in individual cases. A De-
 cember 10 Supreme Court decision imposed a penalty of about $570 (20,000 rupee)
 on persons employing children in hazardous industries and stipulated that parents
 or guardians of children receive an income supplement payment from a fund created
 with this money, on condition that the children removed from employment attend
 school.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The directive principles of the Constitution de-
 clare that "the State shall endeavor to secure    to all workers      a living
 wage, conditions of work ensuring a decent standard of life and full enjoyment of
 leisure and social and cultural opportunities." Laws set minimum wages, hours of
 work, and safety and health standards. Laws governing minimum wages and hours
 of work are generally observed in industries subject to the Factories Act but are
 largely unenrced elsewhere and do not ensure acceptable conditions of work for
 the nine-tenths of the wororoce not subject to the Factories Act. Enforcement of
 safety and health standards is lax.
 Minimum wages vary according to the state and sector of industry. Such wages
 are considered adequate oniy for a minimal standard of living. Most workers em-
 ployed in units subject to the Factories Act receive much more than the minimum
 wage, including mandated bonuses and other benefits. The state governments set
 a separate minimum wage for agricultural workers but do not enforce it well.
 The Factories Act establishes an 8-hour workday, a 48-hour workweek, and var-
 ious standards for working conditions. These standards are generally enforced and
 accepted in the modern industrial sector, but tend not to be observed in older and
 less economically robust industries. State governments are responsible for enforce-
 ment of the Factories Act. However, the large number of industries covered by a
 small cadre of factory inspectors and their limited training and susceptibility to
 bribery make for lax enforcement.
 Although occupational safety and health measures vary widely, in general neither
 state nor central government resources for inspection and enforcement of standards
 are adequate. Safety conditions tend to be better in the EPZs. The law does not pro-
 vide workers with the right to remove themselves from work situations that endan-
 ger health and safety  ithout jeopardizing their continued employment.
