 SPAIN
 Since the death of General Franco in 1975, parliamentary
 democracy has become rooted in Spain within the frame of a
 constitutional monarchy. Under the Constitution, King Juan
 Carlos has very limited powers but he plays an important
 unifying role. The King and all major political parties are
 strongly committed to democracy, and Spanish Society enjoys
 freedom of speech, press, religion, assembly, movement, and
 participation in the political process.
 The current status of human rights in Spain is good. Spain is
 a free society, and its citizens and media can and do bring
 injustices, real or imagined, to public and government
 attention. Spanish governments have also taken an active
 interest in promoting human rights elsewhere, as evidenced by
 Spain's current membership on the U.N. Human Rights Commission.
 Terrorism--separatist and ideological--has been a threat to
 Spanish democracy since its inception, though this threat
 currently appears to be diminishing. Human rights concerns
 tend to focus on the Government's efforts to prevent terrorist
 actions and disrupt terrorist support networks. Some human
 rights advocates oppose the antiterrorist law and amendments
 now pending which, among other things, permit detention of
 suspected terrorists for up to 10 days before arraignment.
 There are also occasional allegations of police brutality,
 including torture. Victims have recourse to an independent
 judiciary or the Government's public defender (ombudsman).
 In addition, laws providing for habeas corpus and legal
 assistance, passed in 1984, ensure that a person arrested
 under the antiterrorist law will have a government-appointed
 attorney during the time he or she is held prior to
 arraignment. Before passage of this law, terrorist detainees
 had no legal representation during the period (up to 10 days)
 of incommunicado detention. In addition, the Government in
 1984 awarded a grant to the Spanish Human Rights Association
 to help develop a video program on human rights for secondary
 schools.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section I Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There is no evidence of political killing performed or
 instigated by government security forces. As a result of
 gunfights in 1984 between government security forces and the
 political terrorist group, the Basque Fatherland and Freedom
 Movement (ETA), individuals on both sides were killed. Human
 rights advocates allege that security forces sometimes use
 excessive force resulting in unnecessary deaths. Terrorists
 killed eight members of Spain's security forces in
 January-October 1984.
 There has been some speculation that the Spanish security
 services may provide assistance to the activities of a new
 political terrorist group, Grupo Anti-terrorista de Liberacion
 (GAL), which has pledged to avenge ETA assassinations and has
 claimed responsibility for the killing of several known ETA
 terrorists living in the Basque area of southern France.
 
 
 1089
 SPAIN
 Those GAL members who have been arrested have been French
 citizens.
 Killings by the ETA totaled 27 in January-October 1984,
 compared with 32 during the same period of 1983. The decrease
 is widely attributed to the improved capabilities of Spanish
 security forces and to increased French cooperation in
 reducing ETA's ability to use France as a safe haven. During
 1984 the French Government expelled some 20 ETA activists to
 Latin American and African countries and extradited 3
 terrorists to Spain for trial.
 b. Disappearance
 There is no evidence that government security forces have
 engaged in secret arrests or kidnappings.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Government security forces have been accused of mistreating
 some arrestees, primarily in terrorism-related cases.
 According to one Spanish human rights activist, 137 complaints
 alleging police mistreatment were filed directly with the
 courts as of October 1984. The public defender's office, an
 ombudsman-type position, received 11 complaints of police
 mistreatment through October 1984. All of these complaints
 were investigated. In two cases it was determined the facts
 warranted disciplinary action.
 Available information suggests that police mistreatment or
 torture is carried out by individuals without the knowledge or
 concurrence of higher authorities. Human rights critics in
 Spain generally acknowledge that torture is neither
 *systematic" nor 'institutionalized'.
 There are indications that the Government is not always
 exercising sufficient oversight of its security forces. At
 ceremonies honoring the Civil Guard on October 12, 1984,
 Minister of Interior Jose Barrionuevo was reported as saying
 that in the 22 months of the current Socialist administration,
 the Government had not received a single complaint of
 mistreatment or torture by the Civil Guard. In the same
 ceremony, however, the Director General of the Civil Guard
 decorated four of its members against whom complaints had been
 lodged with the courts for mistreatment or torture. Minister
 Barrionuevo subsequently requested additional information on
 these charges, and two of the four Civil Guards were
 suspended.
 According to the Director General of Penitentiaries, there
 were "practically no' complaints in 1984 of mistreatment by
 prison authorities. In the past, there have been many
 complaints of overcrowding and inadequate medical attention.
 The Government has dealt with overcrowding through a
 construction and renovation program. One-third of the
 existing prisons have been built in the last 5 years, while
 many others have been modernized. Medical care has been
 improved by a policy of restricting the hours a doctor may
 work to 3-hour shifts. Human rights activists, who state they
 are given complete freedom and cooperation in their
 investigations of prisons, cite the continued and marked
 improvement of prison conditions as one of the most positive
 human rights accomplishments in 1984.

 SPAIN
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention or Exile
 Arbitrary arrest and detention are prohibited by the
 Constitution and respected in practice. Civil libertarians,
 however, find fault with the special antiterrorist legislation
 which permits a person to be detained incommunicado for up to
 10 days. The detainee has to be brought before the court
 during the first 72 hours of detention, but the court has
 discretion to extend the period prior to arraignment for
 another 7 days. In accordance with the laws of legal
 assistance approved in 1984, the Government must provide an
 attorney to an arrested person, including those arrested under
 the antiterrorist law, prior to arraignment.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The Constitution guarantees the right to a fair public trial,
 and this right is observed in practice. The law provides for
 an expeditious judicial hearing following arrest. Defendants
 may always appeal to the next highest court and up to the
 Council of Europe in cases concerning human rights. Three
 Spanish defendants who were convicted for the assassination of
 a Catalan industrialist in 1977 have in fact carried an appeal
 to the Council of Europe for alleged irregularities in the
 Spanish judicial process. The case is pending.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home or
 Correspondence
 Privacy of home and correspondence is protected by the
 Constitution. Under the criminal code, government authorities
 must obtain court approval before making searches of private
 property, wiretapping, or interfering with private
 correspondence. The current antiterrorist law, however,
 permits the Minister of the Interior or the Director of
 Security to initiate postal, telephonic, or telegraphic
 observation *in cases of emergency,' and to inform the court
 of relevant jurisdiction immediately afterwards of the action
 taken.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Government scrupulously observes the guarantee of free
 speech and press provided in the Constitution. Opposition
 viewpoints are freely expressed in speech and through the
 media. Although television is state-owned and managed by
 politically appointed officials, it operates with a measure of
 autonomy under the supervision of a parliamentary oversight
 committee. There is also a state-owned radio network, but
 most stations are privately owned. Although most privately
 owned newspapers receive a newspaper subsidy, they enjoy full
 freedom of expression. The courts, however, may prevent
 publication of articles if an individual can demonstrate that
 such publication would harm his reputation. In addition, the
 courts, acting on a petition by the prosecutor, may order the
 closure of any medium of communication which publicly provokes
 or conspires to commit crimes constituting treason.
 Individuals may also be prosecuted for insulting the King in
 his capacity as Chief of State.
 
 
 1091
 SPAIN
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly of Association
 As provided in the Constitution, all groups have the right of
 assembly and association for political or other purposes.
 Trade unions are free to organize, bargain collectively, and
 strike, as stipulated in the Constitution. About 20 percent
 of the Spanish work force is unionized. Trade unions are not
 subjected to official harassment. They freely maintain ties
 with recognized international organizations.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 There is no state religion in Spain. Catholicism is the
 predominant religion, but other religions are represented and
 function with full freedom. Adherence to a particular faith
 does not by itself confer either advantage or disadvantage on
 one's secular status.
 A law giving legal standing for the first time to
 conscientious objectors and providing for alternative social
 service has passed the lower chamber of Parliament (the
 Congress of Deputies) and is pending in the upper chamber (the
 Senate). The law constitutes an advance in human rights.
 However, one human rights activist criticized the law as
 inequitable because it would require a longer period for
 social service than for military service.
 d. Freedom of Movement within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Spanish citizens have the freedom to travel in and outside the
 country. The Government restricts neither emigration nor
 repatriation. Spain has approximately 80,000 foreigners
 claiming political refugee status. In March 1984 a law
 providing for political asylum was approved. Because of the
 time required to implement this law, it is too soon to judge
 its effect.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Spain is a multiparty democracy with open elections in which
 all citizens over the age of 18 have the right to participate.
 The King continues to play an important unifying role in
 giving legitimacy and support to the process of democratic
 government. Opposition groups exist openly and actively
 participate in the political process. The Spanish Socialist
 Workers' Party won an absolute majority of parliamentary seats
 in the 1982 national elections which attracted a high voter
 turnout of nearly 80 percent. Of more than 50 national and
 regional political organizations which took part, 7 obtained
 seats in the Parliament. In addition, there are now 17
 elected regional governments, and leaders at the municipal
 level are also elected.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government has allowed investigative groups to enter its
 borders, openly tour the country, and report on the status of
 human rights in Spain. The Spanish Human Rights Association
 and Amnesty International note that the Government is both
 
 
 1092
 SPAIN
 accessible and generally responsive to inquiries and requests
 from them.
 The Government demonstrated its interest in and commitment to
 human rights by establishing an Office of Human Rights in the
 Ministry of Foreign Affairs in late 1983. It now has three
 full-time officers. Among other functions, it maintains
 relations with international human rights organizations.
 In its 1984 report (covering the year 1983), Amnesty
 International's main concern was the torture and mistreatment
 of detainees, principally those detained under antiterrorist
 laws. Amnesty believed that available safeguards were
 insufficient to protect the well-being of detainees, although
 it noted that police officers had been brought to trial and
 convicted in one instance. Amnesty was also concerned about
 the prosecution of persons for insulting the King as Chief of
 State, a nonviolent exercise of the right to freedom of
 speech. Freedom House rated Spain 'free."
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 According to World Bank data, Spain's population in 1984 was
 38,435,000. 1982 per capita gross national product was
 $5,433. Current life expectancy at birth is 74.5 years, and
 the infant mortality rate is 9.1 per 1,000 live births. The
 1975 adult literacy rate was 92.4 percent, and the 1981 total
 primary school enrollment ratio was 91.9 percent.
 The economy of Spain is a mixed market economy with government
 intervention. Spain's economy has been affected in the last
 few years by the general slump in the world economy but is now
 slowly beginning to recover. Under the present Socialist
 leadership, inflation has considerably decreased, exports have
 surged, and a painful but necessary program of industrial
 restructuring and modernization has moved forward. A low rate
 of domestic investment and high unemployment (officially set
 at 20 percent) are major problem areas in the economy,
 although these are mitigated somewhat by the existence of a
 substantial *underground" economy.
 Women's equality in the workplace is guaranteed by law. The
 only exceptions are the armed services and mining. The
 Constitution confirmed the equality of the sexes. Nonetheless,
 women face practical hindrances to the achievement of equal
 opportunity because employers are under no legal obligation to
 announce jobs for open competition. In many labor areas,
 however, women are making great strides. In a recent civil
 service examination for judges and prosecutors, women
 outnumbered men.
 Although no woman holds a ministerial position in the present
 Government, the number of women holding high and medium-level
 government positions appears to be increasing. In Parliament,
 there are 19 women deputies out of 348 and 10 female senators
 out of 248.
 The Government has recognized the need to continue improving
 the situation of women in society by creating the Women's
 Institute and, in January 1984, ratifying the Convention of
 Non-Discrimination Against Women. One of the current
 activities of the Women's Institute is to obtain and publicize
 information concerning violence against women. The Women's
 Institute has received 18,000 complaints of spousal battery,
 
 
 1093
 SPAIN
 which it estimates are only 15 percent of the actual cases.
 The Institute has opened a refuge for battered women in
 Madrid. An additional project of the Women's Institute is to
 press the Government to expand the number of family planning
 centers.
