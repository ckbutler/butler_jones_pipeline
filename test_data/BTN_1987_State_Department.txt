 BHUTAN*,
 Bhutan has been ruled by the Wangchuck dynasty of hereditary
 monarchs since 1907. Isolated in the Himalayasbetween India
 and Tibet, the small Kingdom (approximately the combined size
 of Vermont and New Hampshire, with a population of about 1.3
 million) has been able to escape domination by any external
 power since the 10th dentury. It was not until the rule
 (1952-72) of King Jigme Dorji Wangchuck that a Bhutanese ruler
 took steps to move the Kingdom from centuries of medieval
 seclusion toward a more representative political system and a
 better integrated, more productive economy. Although he
 retained strong executive powers, the King created several
 important institutions such as the National Assembly (1953),
 the Royal Advisory Council (1965), and the Council of Ministers
 (1968) 'to provide broader participation in the Government.
 Serfdom was abolished, land reform introduced, laws codified,
 and the judiciary separated from the exedutive.
 The present monarch, Jigme Singye Wangchuck, has continued
 Bhutan's social and political evolution, although progress has
 been seriously handicapped by the Kingdom's limited
 administrative capacity and resources. By all accounts, the
 King is respected for his commitment to the welfare of his
 people.
 Bhutan remains, at least in terms of national income
 statistics, the poorest country in South Asia and one of the
 most traditional and least developed countries in the world.
 The vast majority of the population is illiterate and rural,
 following subsistence agriculture and pastoralism in a largely
 barter economy. Bhutan has no written constitution or bill Of
 rights. Although the Bhutanese Government is still
 essentially autocratic, knowledgeable Bhutanese report no
 major violations of human rights in the Kingdom in 1987. Most
 observers agree that the Kingdom suffers few of the problems
 of disaffection and repression that afflict many Third World
 countries undergoing more rapid change. The human rights
 abuses that do exist are being remedied slowly as the country
 modernizes.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There were no known political killings.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no known disappearances.
 *Bhutan and the United States have not exchanged diplomatic
 representatives, and U.S. officials travel there infrequently.
 Tourism is still in its infancy in the Kingdom, and few
 scholars have published studies on the contemporary Bhutanese
 polity or society. Information on Bhutanese practices that
 bear on human rights is, therefore, neither readily available
 nor complete. ,

 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 There is no evidence of cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment
 or punishment. Serious crimes are still rare, although
 reportedly there has been a trend toward more criminal activity
 in recent years with the growth of a foreign labor force in
 the country, widening economic disparities, and greater
 contact with outside cultural values. Punishments for most
 crimes range from fines to imprisonment. Prison sentences
 range from a few months for manslaughter to life for
 first-degree murder, with little chance for remission.
 Mutilation as a form'of punishment was outlawed in 1965.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, Exile, or Forced Labor
 There is no special or preventive detention, and arrests can
 be made only under legal authority. As far as is known,
 neither exile nor forced labor is now employed as a form of
 punishment.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Criminal cases and a variety of civil matters are adjudicated
 under an 18th century legal code that was revised in 1957 and
 applies to all Bhutanese. Familial questions'are resolved
 according to the traditional religious norms of the two major
 religious groups in the country: Buddhist law governs the
 majority of Bhutanese, and Hindu law is applied in areas where
 persons of Nepali origin predominate.
 Although the legal system does not provide for juries, the
 right to be represented by legal counsel, or due process in
 the Western sense, trials are generally expeditious and
 public. There are generally no prosecuting or defense
 attorneys because there are insufficient lawyers in the
 country to serve in these capacities. Judges, appointed by
 and accountable-to the King, are responsible for all aspects
 of a case, including investigation, filing of charges,
 prosecution, and judgment of the defendant. Knowledgeable
 observers report that the system conforms to the local
 population's concept of impartiality and justice. A separate
 judiciary, established in 1968, provides for local, district,
 and national courts with original and appellate jurisdiction.
 Final appeals may be made to the King.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 There are no written guarantees of privacy in the Bhutanese
 system, but tradition has bolstered the concept. In practice,
 the Government does not intervene arbitrarily or unreasonably
 in the lives of the people.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 With an adult literacy rate of about 12 percent (as measured
 by the United Nations Development Program), Bhutan's adult
 population is relatively unaffected by the print media. The
 Government's weekly newspaper is the country's only regular
 publication. Indian and other foreign newspapers and
 publications are distributed in Bhutan without apparent
 government control. Bhutan has no television, and the one
 
 
 1128
 BHUTAN
 radio station broadcasts for only 3 hours daily. Criticism of
 the King is permitted in the National Assembly but not in the
 public media.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 No written guarantees of these freedoms exist, but Bhutanese
 generally enjoy the freedom of peaceful assembly and
 association. There are no private voluntary social, communal,
 or economic associations and no professional or trade
 organizations. With less than 1 percent of the population
 employed in industry, Bhutan has no labor unions. There is no
 collective bargaining, and no legislation addressing
 labor-related issues.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Buddhism is the state religion of Bhutan. The Government
 subsidizes monasteries and shrines and provides aid to about
 half of the Kingdom's 12,000 monks. The monastic establishment
 enjoys statutory representation in the National Assembly and
 the Royal Advisory Council, and is an influential voice on
 public policy. Citizens of other faiths, who are mainly
 Hindus of Nepali origin, enjoy freedom of worship. In an
 effort to encourage national cultural integration, the King
 has declared major Hindu festivals to be national holidays,
 and the royal family participates in them. Foreign
 missionaries are not permitted to proselytize in the Kingdom.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 There is freedom of movement within Bhutan for all Bhutanese
 citizens, and no bar on emigration or foreign travel. For
 many years Bhutanese traveled little inside or outside the
 Kingdom, but the recent rapid construction of roads and the
 establishment of air links with Calcutta and Dhaka have
 encouraged travel. A policy introduced in the 1950's, which
 prohibited the exiled leaders of an outlawed Nepali Bhutanese
 political party from returning to the country, has been
 liberalized to allow them to return at their request.
 Bhutan traditionally has welcomed refugees and exiles from
 other countries in the region. Some 6,000 Tibetans sought
 refuge in Bhutan in 1959, joining approximately 4,000 Tibetans
 already in the country. Because it perceived threats to its
 national security from the Tibetan refugees' suspected lack of
 allegiance to Bhutan, the Government required in 1979-80 that
 the refugees either accept Bhutanese citizenship or face
 expulsion. Although most Tibetans in Bhutan have accepted
 Bhutanese citizenship, they have been assured by the
 Government that they always will be free to return to their
 homeland. The Government decided not to carry out its threat
 to deport those who did not embrace Bhutanese citizenship.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 The citizens of Bhutan do not have the right to change their
 government. The Bhutanese political system is a traditional
 monarchy, with sovereign and wide-ranging power vested in the
 King. It is a highly elitist polity, with decisionmaking
 centered in the palace and involving only a small number of
 officials in the civil and religious establishments. Although
 the present King and his father have endeavored to integrate
 
 
 1129
 BHUTAN
 women and southerners (Nepali ethnics) into the body politic,
 the system is still dominated by the male members of an
 aristocracy of Tibetan Buddhist stock. Political parties do
 not exist, and their formation is discouraged. Local
 administration is carried out by centrally appointed government
 officials. Villages, however, have the traditional right to
 elect by consensus their own headmen who form the lowest rung
 of the administrative hierarchy. When the King is touring
 outlying districtp of the Kingdom (which he does frequently),
 any citizen can flag down his car and present an aide with a
 written petition, which is assured an official response.
 The 150-member National Assembly is composed of 105 members
 elected by limited franchise (heads of family in Hindu areas,
 village headmen in Buddhist regions), 12 elected by the
 monastic establishment, and 33 high-level officials of the
 government administration appointed by the King. Its
 principal functions are to enact laws, approve senior
 appointments in the Government, and advise the King on matters
 of national importance. It also provides a forum for
 presenting grievances and rectifying cases of
 maladministration.
 Voting is by secret ballot, with a simple majority needed to
 pass a measure. Government officials may be questioned by the
 body, and ministers can be forced to resign by-a two-thirds
 vote of no confidence. The King cannot formally veto
 legislation passed by the Assembly, but he can refer bills
 back to it for further consideration. The Assembly
 occasionally has rejected the King's recommendations or
 delayed their implementation, but the King has enough influence
 to persuade the Assembly to approve any legislation he
 considers essential or to withdraw any proposed legislation he
 opposes.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 No international agency or group is known to have sought entry
 into Bhutan to investigate human rights conditions. No
 nongovernmental human rights groups are known to exist in
 Bhutan, nor do human rights appear to be a subject of domestic
 political debate.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 The status of women is higher in Bhutan than in many of the
 surrounding countries. In contrast with some of its
 neighbors, Bhutan has not developed a rigid caste system nor
 customs which sequester or disenfranchise women. Boys tend to
 outnumber girls by about 2 to 1 in primary school, but family
 land is divided equally between sons and daughters.
 The sexes mix relatively freely, marriages can be arranged by
 partners themselves as well as by their parents, and divorce
 is common. A man is allowed by law to have three wives, but
 polyandry is not sanctioned. Legislation has been enacted in
 recent years making marriage registration compulsory and
 favoring women in matters of alimony. In 1985 some 10 percent
 of the persons employed by the various government ministries
 and departments were women.

 BHUTAN
 The potentially most divisive issue in Bhutan is how to
 accommodate the large (estimated at 20-30 percent) segment of
 the population of Nepali Hindu origin. The country's Buddhist
 majority has long been concerned about being outnumbered by
 immigrants from Nepal, as occurred in neighboring Sikkim. In
 the past, the Government responded to this concern by tightly
 limiting immigration and restricting residence and employment
 of the Nepali population to the southern part of the country.
 More recently, the Government's policy toward the Nepali
 minority has been liberalized. Intermarriages are being
 encouraged (even the King's sister has married a Nepali
 Bhutanese), a percentage of students from one region is being
 educated in another, and greater priority is being given to
 the economic development of the south.
 By law southerners are allowed to own land and establish
 businesses in the north, and vice versa, but reportedly it is
 sometimes still difficult for non-Buddhist Bhutanese (except
 government officials) to buy property in Buddhist areas. More
 and more young Bhutanese of Nepali origin are being brought
 into public economic and administrative bodies. Laws
 concerning land tenure and taxation in the south are being
 liberalized as well. The requirement that Dzongkha, the
 language of the western highlands, be taught in all schools is
 said to disadvantage students from other areas, but in general
 the Government is sensitive to the problems of national
 integration and is attempting to eliminate the factors which
 sometimes led Nepali Bhutanese to describe themselves as
 second-class citizens.
 Families with ties to the palace and senior levels of the
 Government are strongly favored in their access to state
 scholarships for foreign education, but the King is making a
 serious effort to draw qualified persons from a broader range
 of social and ethnic backgrounds into the prestigious civil
 bureaucracy.
 CONDITIONS OF LABOR
 Bhutan has no minimum wage laws or other labor legislation
 governing its small industrial labor force. Less than I
 percent of the population is employed in industry. Because
 many Bhutanese prefer traditional agriculture to industrial
 work and because there are few urban centers in the Kingdom
 from which to draw manpower, disciplined workers are in short
 supply and are highly prized by employers. The shortage of
 labor in Bhutan is such that the larger industrial firms, all
 of which were established relatively recently, are organized
 along modern lines and incorporate a considerable amount of
 labor-saving technology. No industrial plant employs more
 than 60-70 workers, and most of these are guest workers from
 Nepal. Apart from a few larger plants, the entire industrial
 sector consists of home-based handicrafts and some 60 privately
 owned small- or medium-scale factories producing consumer
 goods. Children are not employed in industrial labor.
