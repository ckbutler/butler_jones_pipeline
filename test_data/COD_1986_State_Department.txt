 ZAIRE
 President Mobutu Sese Seko, who came to power in 1965, heads
 both the Government of Zaire and its only legal party, the
 Popular Movement of the Revolution (MPR). The President has
 the constitutional power to promulgate laws by decree. In
 theory, authority is shared with the popularly elected
 Legislative Council. In practice, the Parliament rarely
 disagrees with presidential decisions, although decrees are
 usually preceded by consultations with party leaders and
 legislators. The single legal party automatically includes
 all Zairian citizens as members. The Executive Council (Prime
 Minister and Council of Ministers), the Legislative Council
 (unicameral parliament), the judiciary, and the only labor
 union (National Union of Zairian Workers) are all organs of
 the party.
 A complex of security organizations, notably the civilian
 National Documentation Agency, the paramilitary gendarmerie
 and civil guard, and the armed forces share responsibility for
 identifying and controlling potential internal and external
 threats to Zaire and the Government. Their broad powers and
 influence can lead to arbitrary harassment and detention of
 ordinary citizens as well as suspected political opponents of
 the Government.
 Zaire has a mixed economy. Though major mining and
 transportation activities are state owned, private enterprise
 is the rule in the other sectors, with the State often holding
 a minority equity position in larger firms. Zaire shares the
 economic problems of most sub-Saharan African countries,
 including low income levels, inadequate infrastructure, low
 world prices for export commodities, and a high foreign debt.
 However, after several unsuccessful starts, Zaire's extensive
 economic reform program, initiated in January 1983, had
 achieved significant progress in stabilizing the economy by
 1986.
 Credible allegations of serious human rights abuses continued
 to be heard in 1986. One positive development was the loss of
 much of the momentum in the 20-year-old insurgency in eastern
 Zaire when the Government succeeded in negotiating the
 peaceful surrender of 1,500 persons, including rebel soldiers
 and their families. No major military actions were reported
 along the shores of Lake Tanganyika between Uvira in Kivu
 province and Mobs in Shaba province, a village that was
 attacked by rebel forces in both 1984 and 1985. Former rebels
 in eastern Zaire who turned themselves in to government forces
 have reportedly been accorded humane treatment, and most have
 returned to their home villages. With the insurgency waning,
 no reports of civilian casualties appeared. In contrast, the
 Government lessened its efforts to reconcile differences with
 political dissidents, and leading members of a group
 advocating the legalization of a second political party were
 rearrested and subsequently exiled to the interior of the
 country in June and July. Despite some positive steps in
 November to improve the administration of justice and check
 excesses, harassment of citizens by law enforcement personnel
 and inordinate delays in processing of detainees remained
 serious problems at the end of the year. The Government also
 banned activities by the Jehovah's Witnesses and several other
 minor religious groups.

 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section I Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 Fighting between rebel and government forces produced
 allegations of politically motivated casualties in eastern
 Zaire in 1984 and 1985. There were no substantiated incidents
 of such killing for political motives in 1986. However,
 dissidents advocating establishment of a second political
 party, the Union for Democracy and Social Progress (UDPS),
 have published a list of UDPS members allegedly killed while
 in detention. It is impossible to confirm these allegations.
 b. Disappearance
 Rumors of the disappearance of detainees surface from time to
 time. There were no credible reports that such disappearances
 took place in 1986.
 c.    Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment
 or Punishment
 The Government states that it does not condone torture and
 denies allegations that torture is administered by its
 officials during interrogation. Amnesty International, on the
 other hand, has on numerous occasions alleged, most recently
 in a report dated March 1986, that the Government is
 responsible for arbitrary arrests, torture, and extrajudicial
 executions. Amnesty's report refers to acts allegedly
 committed by Zairian armed forces in Shaba in the period July
 1984-July 1985. Amnesty maintains that torture and physical
 mistreatment of detainees is routine in most Zairian places of
 detention. It is likely that physical mistreatment of
 detainees, particularly the use of undue force at the time of
 arrest and during preliminary interrogation, is common
 practice. There are regular reports of unsanitary and
 overcrowded facilities, malnutrition, and starvation among
 prisoners. A lack of concern at senior levels, incompetence,
 corruption, and limited funding all contribute to these
 problems, although they also stem from ingrained social and
 economic factors. A commission established in 1985 to
 investigate prison and judicial performance continued its
 work, albeit at a slow pace. The Government's failure to
 provide additional resources hampered efforts to expand its
 activities in the interior of the country, where the situation
 is as serious as it is in Kinshasa.
 Undisciplined and underpaid police and military personnel
 often abuse their authority by harassing and extorting money
 from civilians, who have reportedly been killed in some of
 these incidents. Because of the popular discontent these
 practices create, authorities are making efforts to improve
 the discipline of security personnel. Soldiers in the Shaba
 region, for example, have been instructed to improve their
 treatment of civilians, and the head of the gendarmerie in
 Kinshasa has instituted a campaign against police agents who
 prey upon the population. In November the military
 intelligence service was dissolved, and several of its
 officers were discharged from the army for abusing their
 authority. In a related development, a number of paramilitary
 civil guards were discharged and publicly criticized for
 
 
 355
 ZAIRE
 illegally harassing the civilian population. Despite the
 ongoing campaign to check the excesses of security personnel,
 serious problems remain.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Arbitrary arrest and prolonged detention without charges
 remain common occurrences, affecting most people who come into
 contact with the criminal justice system. By law those
 arrested must be brought before a magistrate to hear charges
 within 48 hours of arrest. In practice, however, suspects are
 often arrested and held for months without a hearing.
 Detainees with financial resources are known to buy their way
 out of detention without the charges ever being filed.
 When formally arraigned, most political detainees are charged
 with subversion or "damage to the internal security of the
 State." Judicial and nonjudicial sanctions are authorized by
 law against persons suspected of threatening state security.
 In practice, most individuals detained for political reasons
 are held by means of nonjudicial sanctions which range from
 administrative detention and house arrest to internal exile to
 villages of origin and restriction of movement and travel.
 They are not formally charged or tried, remaining in detention
 or internal exile arbitrarily until the President chooses to
 release them. Such arrests and relegations are made openly,
 and the whereabouts of detainees are known, at least
 unofficially, although it is sometimes not acknowledged by the
 Government.
 Estimates of the number of people detained or sentenced for
 essentially nonviolent expression of political beliefs vary
 greatly and are often out of date as detainees are released or
 others arrested, often for short periods of time. Estimates
 at the beginning of 1986 ran from 50 to 60. A number of
 militants of the UDPS, including 6 of the 13 former
 parliamentarians who initially founded the UDPS, were sent
 into internal exile in June 1986. Two of these leaders,
 Tshisekedi wa Mulumba and Kanana Tshiongo, were tried for
 insulting the President and sentenced to 18 months
 imprisonment in January, released in February, and rearrested
 and internally exiled in June. UDPS sources abroad have
 listed 36 members detained in Zaire as well as another 37
 relegated, and they allege that this list is incomplete. In
 addition, there are reports that some persons detained for
 political beliefs are not associated with the UDPS. On the
 other hand, the detention of large numbers of persons in
 Kalemie and Moba following the rebel attacks in 1984 and 1985
 has ended. The best estimate of the number of political
 detainees (including those relegated to their native villages)
 and prisoners at the end of 1986 was 80 to 90. The Government
 maintains that it holds no political prisoners. There were no
 known cases of exile or expulsion of Zairians from the country
 in 1986.
 Zairian legislation provides for compulsory civilian service
 for graduates from pedagogical and technical institutes, and a
 government ordinance authorizes imprisonment with compulsory
 labor for tax defaulters. There are no known instances in
 which tax defaulters have actually been sentenced to
 compulsory labor, although imprisonment at hard labor is a
 common sentence for those convicted of crimes.

 ZAIRE
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Defendants are guaranteed the right to a public trial and
 defense counsel by the Constitution. In practice, however,
 most citizens are not aware of these rights, and there is an
 insufficient number of lawyers in Zaire to provide adequate
 counsel to most defendants. When available, defense counsel
 generally function freely and without coercion from the
 Government in nonpolitical cases. Most defendants who are
 aware of their rights avail themselves of the right to
 appeal. Decisions of the Court of State Security involving
 national security, armed robbery, and smuggling are not
 subject to appeal, although all other procedural protections
 of the criminal code do apply. Military court procedures also
 do not provide for appeal. While military courts generally
 try only cases involving military personnel, in time of
 emergency or during military operations, the President can
 suspend civilian courts and transfer jurisdiction over all
 cases to military courts (as was done in the Moba-Kalemie area
 in late 1984).
 There is criticism of the judicial process on two levels. At
 the political level, all judges are subject to party
 discipline. The result is that, while judges in fact perform
 their function without political interference in the great
 majority of cases, in sensitive or highly politicized cases
 they operate under implicit or explicit constraints from the
 executive or security forces.
 At the daily operational level, there is concern that, in
 addition to the security authorities harassing citizens, some
 poorly paid magistrates also seek bribes and apply the full
 rigor of the law essentially to those who are unable to pay
 such bribes. In response to these concerns, the Government
 took steps in 1986 to improve the administration of justice.
 In November President Mobutu turned over the Ministry of
 Justice and the judiciary to a senior political figure,
 charging him with reforming the system and announced the
 creation at the Executive Council (ministerial) level of a
 Department of Citizens' Rights and Liberties, which is headed
 by an influential former Supreme Court justice. The new
 Department is charged with placing representatives throughout
 the country at zone (county/ward) level and in all major
 enterprises, both public and private, and is responsible for
 investigating the complaints of Zairians who feel that their
 legal rights have been abridged by administrative, military,
 or judicial agents. In cases where such abuses are
 identified, the Department of Citizens' Rights and Liberties
 is empowered to offer redress to the victims of unjust
 decisions. A first result was the announcement at the
 beginning of 1987 of the release of 165 detainees who had been
 imprisoned under "irregular conditions."
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Party and state security organizations extend down to the
 neighborhood level, and both maintain liaison offices in all
 government agencies (including military units, universities,
 the Legislative Council, ministries, etc.). Party officials,
 civil servants, armed forces personnel, parliamentarians, and
 employees of state enterprises pay an obligatory tax to
 support the activities of the party's major organs (cadre
 training, mobilization, propaganda, and youth). These party
 
 
 357
 ZAIRE
 cadres are also required to attend the party's training
 institute. Nonattendance can result in reprimands and
 suspensions. Government employees, market vendors, and
 blue-collar workers are often required to participate in
 public events--parades, official arrival and departure
 ceremonies, etc.--or risk being suspended from their jobs. In
 line with the party-state's ideology of "Zairian
 authenticity," Zairian men are forbidden to wear ties and
 women to wear slacks or wigs. Zairians are also forbidden in
 principle to use non-African names.
 Judicial warrants are required by law before the police are
 permitted to search a home, except in cases of threats to
 national security. In practice, however, police and security
 authorities enter and search homes without such warrants.
 Mail is opened sporadically by security services, some
 telephone conversations are tapped, and government informers
 monitor places of residence as well as of work. In civil
 cases where defendants have been found guilty of fraud or
 embezzlement from the Government, their property and homes can
 be confiscated without reimbursement.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution guarantees the right of all citizens to
 express freely their opinions and feelings, either orally or
 in writing, but subordinates that and all other rights to the
 need to ensure "public order and good conduct." All Zairians
 are automatically members of the sole political party, the
 Popular Movement for the Revolution (MRP). The ideology of
 the MRP, and thus the only acceptable public profession of
 political thought, comprises the views and policies of the
 party's president and founder, President Mobutu Sese Seko. As
 in many one-party systems, the theater, songs, and
 all-pervasive street gossip are important forums for
 communicating popular opinions and news.
 Radio and television are owned and operated by the State. The
 major newspapers are privately owned but are believed to
 depend upon significant government subsidies for survival. In
 addition, they receive most of their news from the Zairian
 National Press Agency (AZAP), a state organization. The media
 are expected to promote the ideals and principles of the sole
 political party. Generally, publishers and editors are active
 party members. Commentary on politically sensitive internal
 issues as well as on foreign policy options is discouraged,
 and direct criticism of the President is forbidden. While
 journalists are circumspect in their criticism of other high
 officials as well, criticism of certain government practices,
 inadequate services, and corruption frequently appears in
 print.
 Media censorship tends to be self-imposed, but in certain
 situations political authorities restrict the scope of
 journalistic inquiry by both Zairian and foreign journalists.
 In 1986 one Zairian magazine was banned and its publisher
 detained without charge for over 6 months when he printed
 articles which criticized actions of high government
 officials. The foreign representative of an international
 news syndicate was expelled from Zaire for filing reports that
 were unflattering to the Government, and several other foreign
 journalists were denied permission to visit Zaire to report on
 
 
 358
 ZAIRE
 topics which the Government did not wish broached. All
 foreign journalists wishing to visit Zaire must receive prior
 permission from the Ministry of Information, and Zairian
 journalists must be members of the press union in order to
 practice their profession. The threat of ouster from the
 union and consequent loss of livelihood are strong inducements
 toward self-censorship. There are several clandestine presses
 which operate sporadically, printing flyers and handbills
 critical of the Government and various Zairian leaders.
 Artistic and academic freedom of expression are subject to the
 same restrictions and self-censorship as the press. Mandatory
 membership in professional organizations and well-developed
 informer networks serve to discourage dissent. From time to
 time, books, films, and certain issues of newspapers and
 magazines are banned. Imported publications, including books
 and periodicals, are subject to censorship if they are
 critical of Zaire or its Government.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Only the party and its affiliates may hold public meetings.
 The Government permits the existence of nonpolitical
 associations, but in principle they must notify authorities
 when they plan meetings or activities involving more than five
 people. The Government can also prohibit meetings which
 continue after 9 p.m. Meetings of nonofficial organizations
 and of some religious sects (see Section 2.c. below) have been
 disrupted on occasion by government agents because of
 suspected political activities.
 The labor movement in Zaire is limited to one national union,
 the National Union of Zairian Workers (UNTZA), which is an
 integral unit of the sole political party. The secretary
 general of UNTZA is a member of the party's central committee,
 and union officials at the regional level serve on regional
 party committees. UNTZA has the right to bargain collectively
 with employers and provides significant social and educational
 services to members and their families. It works with the
 Government to improve worker benefits. However, it is unable
 to promote worker interests or defend worker rights which run
 counter to government policies. The right to strike is
 included in the labor law, but because the law establishes
 lengthy and mandatory arbitration and appeal procedures which
 result in the resolution of most labor disputes, in practice
 lawful strikes do not occur. There were nonetheless several
 short, unauthorized, but tolerated strikes in the private
 sector during 1986 which generally succeeded in focusing
 government and management attention on union concerns.
 Membership in UNTZA is compulsory for civil servants,
 employees of state enterprises, and employees of private firms
 with at least 20 employees. The union claims over 1 million
 workers as dues-paying members. However, the overwhelming
 majority of the work force is self-employed, either in the
 unofficial sector or in subsistence agriculture, which is not
 covered by the union. UNTZA participates actively in the
 International Labor Organization and the Organization of
 African Trade Union Unity and maintains ties with a number of
 foreign labor confederations.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Zairians enjoy freedom of religion, which is recognized in the
 Constitution. The Government officially sanctions most of the
 
 
 359
 ZAIRE
 major world religions and provides procedures for new churches
 to obtain government recognition. Traditional African
 religious groups are tolerated but not officially recognized.
 The three major religions in Zaire are Catholicism--50
 percent, Protestantism--36 percent, and Islam--5 percent. In
 1986 the Government took firm steps to clamp down on a number
 of religious groups considered to be politically deviant or
 dangerous. Several sects and religious groups, including the
 Jehovah's Witnesses, were banned, thus effectively preventing
 them from operating in Zaire. The Government officially
 charged these groups with: (a) intentional fraud in
 financially bilking the public; (b) subversive activities such
 as operating fronts for opposition political movements; or (c)
 refusing to participate in civic demonstrations (saluting the
 flag, singing the national anthem, etc.) and/or the party's
 political "animation" sessions. For example, the Government
 banned religious meetings in Mbuji-Mayi, the capital of Kasai
 Oriental and a traditional center of Baluba antipathy to the
 central Government. It also banned 10 unconventional groups
 in Mbandaka, the capital of Equateur region, citing antisocial
 activities. Members of these banned organizations reported
 that some of them had suffered officially sanctioned abuses
 such as beatings, destruction or seizure of personal and
 church property, fines, imprisonment, and expulsion from
 schools or workplaces.
 Officially recognized religions are free to establish places
 of worship and to train clergy. Most churches maintain active
 links with coreligionists outside the country, and expatriate
 missionaries are allowed to proselytize and to serve both
 Zairian and expatriate congregations. However, some
 expatriate Jehovah's Witness missionaries were required to
 leave the country. Affiliation with a recognized religion
 confers neither advantage nor disadvantage with respect to
 secular status.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 The Government at times imposes special documentation
 requirements for travel to areas of unrest or security
 concern. As noted earlier, the Government also restricts some
 dissidents to villages of origin. All citizens, refugees, and
 permanent residents must carry government-issued identity
 cards, and police and military personnel often set up
 checkpoints along major roads to inspect papers. Those whose
 papers are not in order must pay a fine or spend time in
 jail. In principle, any Zairian citizen may obtain a passport
 and exit visa, although on occasion government and security
 officials have impeded issuance in order to prevent or disrupt
 travel of persons suspected of political opposition to the
 Government. A married woman must have her husband's
 permission before obtaining a passport.
 At the end of 1986, there were 53,000 officially registered
 Zairians living as displaced persons or refugees in
 neighboring countries. Many refugees and displaced persons
 have returned under amnesties declared in 1978 and 1983, and
 negotiations occur sporadically with refugee groups or the
 countries where they reside for additional repatriations. It
 is likely that many Zairian displaced persons could return to
 Zaire if they wished. A number of political opponents of the
 Government, however, live in self-imposed exile in Europe and
 
 
 360
 ZAIRE
 probably could not return safely without renouncing their
 political views.
 In September 1986, Zaire was providing a safe haven to
 approximately 325,000 displaced persons from neighboring
 countries. Generally such people pass freely into Zaire and
 are allowed to settle on the land or seek employment. The
 Government considers them to be resettled until such time as
 they decide to return to their country of origin. Although
 the Government generally accepts displaced persons, it does
 not have the resources to provide assistance beyond free land,
 and international agencies play an active role in providing
 humanitarian assistance. At times, displaced persons from
 neighboring countries (particularly Angola) have been
 detained, harassed, or closely monitored by security forces on
 suspicion of illegal political activity.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Citizens have no right to change their Government through
 present institutions. Political power in Zaire is highly
 centralized and controlled by the President, who makes all
 important decisions. Under Zaire's Constitution, the State is
 essentially the executive organ of the country's sole
 political party, the Popular Movement of The Revolution.
 Party congresses meet every 5 years under the guidance of the
 President to set national political guidelines, which are then
 supplemented by resolutions of the party's central committee.
 These policies are executed by the Prime Minister and Cabinet,
 both appointed by the President. Advocacy of a multiparty
 system or opposition to the party-state are both
 unconstitutional and illegal, as are actions which question
 the authority of the President and the political system.
 Suffrage is universal over age 18, and voting is mandatory,
 enforced by penalties including fines or arrest. The national
 Parliament, municipal councils, and rural and urban zone
 councils are chosen by direct popular elections which take
 place every 5 years, with the next one scheduled for 1987.
 All candidates are screened by party committees at the
 appropriate level, but voters generally have a choice of
 several candidates. President Mobutu was reelected in 1984
 with no opposition to a third 7-year term in office.
 Since 1980 a group of former parliamentarians has been
 involved in an effort to establish a second political party,
 the Union for Democracy and Social Progress (UDPS). Their
 efforts have been rebuffed by the official party and by the
 President, and they have suffered arrest and detention at
 various times over the past 6 years. Members of the group,
 including most of its leaders, were sent into internal exile
 in June 1986 after a dialogue between UDPS leaders and
 President Mobutu failed to convince the UDPS to rejoin the
 official party. A significant number of other UDPS members
 remain in detention at various locations around the country.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government stresses the importance of the principle of
 noninterference by outside organizations (and states) in its
 internal affairs but maintains that Zaire has nothing to hide
 
 
 361
 ZAIRE
 in terms of human rights policies, and it denies charges of
 systematic or serious violations. Its attitude toward
 external investigation of alleged human rights violations has
 in practice been mixed. Zaire has in the past cooperated with
 the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), which has
 had permanent representation in Zaire since 1978. In the
 first 6 months of 1986, it permitted the ICRC to visit
 detention centers and prisons both in Kinshasa and the
 interior of the country. However, Zaire has not permitted the
 ICRC access to prisons since mid-June, at the time of the
 arrest/relegation of the UDPS leadership.
 In 1986 Amnesty International leveled harsh criticism at Zaire
 in a series of newsletters and reports, noting, inter alia,
 its concerns over the 1985 arrest of members of the UDPS. The
 Government has generally contended that Amnesty
 International's reports are inaccurate and biased since they
 are based upon the testimony of misinformed Zairian dissidents
 living in Europe. The Government has not allowed Amnesty's
 representatives to visit Zaire since 1982. However, in
 October President Mobutu acknowledged publicly that some of
 Amnesty's more recent allegations were well founded. He cited
 this finding in explaining the decision to establish the new
 Department of Citizens' Rights and Liberties. In August
 Amnesty restated its position that the Government had failed
 to respond to its many requests to visit Zaire.
 A local organization purporting to study human rights issues
 was inactive in 1986, and in the past it did not address
 itself to specific Zairian problems, concentrating instead on
 general issues.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Home to approximately 300 disparate ethnic groups, most of
 which have their own tribal languages, Zaire has a population
 of 30.7 million. The Government has sought to defuse disputes
 based on linguistic or ethnic diversity by adopting French as
 the official language of government and education. Four
 vehicular lanuages--Lingala, Swahili, Tshiluba, and
 Kikongo--also serve to bridge the communication gap with
 smaller tribal groups. Many urban Zairians speak Lingala, the
 languages used in both the army and the capital city, or
 Swahili in the east of the country. However, the fact that
 many rural people are unacquainted with these languages
 complicates their dealings with government and military
 officials.
 The Government strives to counter ethnic divisions by
 recruiting ministers and other high government officials from
 all regions and major ethnic groups. One longtime hallmark of
 the Mobutu Government is an emphasis of the primacy of a
 Zairian national identity. In 1986 government mediators
 helped settle at least two interclan disputes. At the local
 level, the Government recognizes group differences by giving
 tribal elders and customary chiefs authority in many local
 matters.
 The role of women in Zairian society is given great emphasis
 in party doctrine. Women's rights to own property and
 participate in the political and economic sectors are
 protected by law, and a growing number of women work in the
 professions, government service, and the universities.
 
 
 362
 ZAIRE
 Nevertheless, custom, tradition, and existing law continue to
 constrain women from attaining a position of complete equality
 in society. Women generally earn less than their male
 counterparts in the same jobs. In addition, married women
 must obtain their husband's authorization before opening a
 bank account, accepting a job, obtaining a passport, and
 renting or selling real estate. A new universally applicable
 family code--which encompasses everything from women's rights
 to divorce laws to inheritance regulations--has been approved
 by the Parliament and awaited only the President's signature
 at the end of 1986.
 CONDITIONS OF LABOR
 As in much of the rest of Africa, unemployment and
 underemployment are serious problems. Since independence,.the
 percentage of rural population engaged in subsistence
 agriculture has actually increased to 75 percent. Zaire has
 been implementing a stringent program of economic reform since
 1983 in cooperation with the International Monetary Fund.
 Faced with drastically reduced prices for its main export
 commodities, Zaire has not been able to achieve positive per
 capita economic growth rates. During the past 4 years, the
 industrial base has expanded with the creation of several
 small and middle-sized enterprises. However, the industrial
 sector as a whole operated at much less than full capacity in
 1986. While wages are generally above the minimum wage, that
 minimum by itself is insufficient to provide an adequate
 living for a worker. Workers in the formal private sector
 also benefit from fringe benefit packages making up more than
 half the total wage package. Many civil servants supplement
 their incomes through commercial activities, frequently in the
 informal unregulated sector. Low salaries and job insecurity
 have contributed to corruption in the Government and
 military. Recent government reforms include a new minimum
 agricultural wage, a higher minimum industrial wage, revisions
 in the Government's personnel system to provide comparable pay
 for comparable work throughout the military and civil service,
 and a sizable increase in the wages of civil servants in June
 1986.
 Worker rights are protected by law, but the fact that such a
 large percentage of the work force is in the informal sector
 limits the effectiveness of those laws. The minimum age for
 employment in Zaire is 14 years. However, many children under
 14 are engaged in various income-earning activities and are
 often a major source of family income. Workers employed in
 the public and organized private sector have generally
 acceptable conditions of work: working hours are set by law
 and collective bargaining and do not exceed 48 hours a week;
 workers enjoy a full 24-hour rest day per week, and many have
 a 48-hour weekend; paid holidays and vacations are required by
 law and are included in all labor contracts; and workplaces
 are required to meet minimum health standards set by law.
