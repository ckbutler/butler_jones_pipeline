 NIGER
 Niger is governed by an authoritarian military regime with
 power concentrated in the hands of its President, Colonel Ali
 Saibou who succeeded the late General Seyni Kountche in
 November. Saibou also heads the nation's highest body, the
 Supreme Military Council. Kountche, who died of natural
 causes, took power in 1974 in a military coup, toppling the
 civilian regime of Hamani Diori. At that time the Constitution
 was suspended, and the country has since been ruled by decree.
 President Saibou was Chief of Staff of the Armed Forces from
 1976 until assuming the Presidency.
 The Nigerien Armed Forces, numbering about 2,600 members plus
 800 gendarmes (paramilitary police), help ensure internal
 security. Other security organizations are: the Direction de
 la Securite de L'Etat (DSE), which reports directly to the
 President; the Surete National (or National Police) which is
 responsible for maintaining public order and countering
 antigovernment activity; and a presidential protection unit.
 Niger, one of the world's poorest countries, occupies a large
 area in the arid Sahel region of West Africa. The economy is
 based on subsistence farming, livestock, and some of the
 world's largest uranium deposits. However, severe drought, a
 3.1 percent population growth rate, and declining world demand
 for uranium since the. early 1980's, have seriously weakened
 the economy.
 Human rights are circumscribed. The freedoms of assembly,
 speech, and political activity are restricted. Public dissent
 is almost nonexistent, and private dissent rare for fear of
 retribution. In 1987, however, a popular referendum approved
 the National Charter. Individual liberties of opinion and
 thought, expression, conscience, movement, residence, and
 communication are provided for in principle in the Charter, as
 are the "collective liberties" of assembly and political
 meetings. The Charter is to serve as the basis for Niger's
 future constitution, which supposedly will guide the country's
 eventual return to civilian rule. The late President Kountche
 stressed, nonetheless, in April that the military will
 continue to play a major role in the political life of the
 nation.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity-of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There were no reports of political'killings.
 b. Disappearance
 No disappearances were reported.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Systematic torture of detainees and prisoners is not believed
 to take place. While not officially sanctioned by the
 Government, cruel treatment, usually in the form of beatings,
 has been meted out by officials charged with the custody of
 prisoners. Foreigners resident in Niger are frequently
 harassed by the police and occasionally suffer physical abuse

 NIGER
 while in detention. It is believed that political prisoners
 or detainees are rarely allowed visits from family members,
 but some with severe medical problems have been allowed
 treatment by specialists from Europe. In its 1987 Report,
 Amnesty International (AI) expressed concern that detainees
 continued to be held in harsh conditions, including in a
 remote prison in eastern Niger.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, Exile, or Forced Labor
 With the Constitution suspended since 1974, there are no
 specific statutory protections against arbitrary arrest or
 imprisonment. Warrants are not required for an arrest, and
 there is no right to judicial review of the legality of
 arrests or detentions. For criminal offenses, the law holds
 that detainees must be charged within 48 hours, but delays
 sometimes occur as the result of lack of trained legal
 officials. In cases concerning political or security-related
 matters, detainees can be held indefinitely without charge.
 When the Government believes the national security to be at
 risk, large numbers of citizens may be rounded up arbitrarily
 for questioning, as with the roundup of Tuaregs in Niamey
 after the attack on a police station in Tchin-Tabaraden in
 1985. There are no known instances of dissidents or political
 opponents being exiled by the Government, although some
 dissidents have gone into exile voluntarily.
 Forced labor is not practiced in Niger, but during the 1985
 drought emergency, displaced herders, primarily ethnic Tuaregs
 and Fulanis, were in some instances forcibly moved onto
 government-sponsored, vegetable-growing projects.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Niger's legal system is an amalgam of French, Islamic, and
 traditional law. Civil and criminal cases not involving
 security-related acts are tried publicly. Legal counsel is
 provided by the State for indigent defendants accused of
 felonies or other major offenses if they are under 18 years of
 age, handicapped, or faced with the possibility of a sentence
 of more than 10 years. While there are reliable accounts that
 courts in some specific cases have been subject to political
 influence or pressure in ordinary civil or criminal cases, the
 judicial system is believed to be generally independent and
 fair. Defendants may appeal verdicts first to an appellate
 court and, if desired, to the nation's highest tribunal, the
 State Court, composed of civilian magistrates, which serves as
 a final court of appeals. The President has the right of
 pardon in penal cases and has invoked this right on several
 occasions in recent years. At the village level, matters such
 as property disputes are frequently resolved by traditional
 means without reference to the formal legal system.
 The exact number of political prisoners in Niger is unknown,
 although it is believed to be small. In November 1987,
 President Saibou ordered the release or commutation of the
 sentences of over 100 political prisoners, including 15
 persons being held in connection with a 1976 coup attempt, and
 16 of the 19 held in connection with the October 1983 coup
 attempt. He also commuted to life imprisonment the death
 sentences of 7 of the 11 Tuareg prisoners convicted for their
 roles in the 1985 Tchin-Tabaraden attack and released from
 house arrest 52 persons, including-former President Hamani
 Diori.

 NIGER
 Political and security-related cases are tried in the State
 Security Court, which operates outside the normal legal
 framework. This body, established by presidential decree,
 meets in secret, and while littleis known about its
 proceedings, it is believed that its members are military
 officers. According to Al, the Tuaregs condemned to death in
 1985 were tried before this court.
 In June 1985, President Kountche announced the formation of a
 special court to investigate civil service corruption. Stiff
 penalties were established for these crimes, including the
 death penalty for convictions of embezzlement of amounts over
 $500,000. At the corruption trials held in 1986, however,
 life imprisonment was the most severe penalty assessed.
 Trials were also held in 1987 but were not widely publicized.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The police have the right to enter homes between 5 a.m. and 9
 p.m. and will enter at other times if deemed necessary. Court
 warrants are not required in such instances. Violations of
 privacy such as interference with correspondence, telephone
 tapping, and use of informer networks are known to take place.
 I
 Section 2 Re~pect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 These freedoms are restricted. Institutions which might voice
 dissent, such as an independent press or a freely elected
 legislature, do not exist. The media are controlled by the
 Government. While some criticism of government policy or
 bureaucratic inefficiency is allowed, especially in the weekly
 publication, Sunday Sahel, such criticism is expressed at the
 behest of, or at least with the knowledge and permission of,
 the Government. Debates on aspects of the economy or cultural
 policy sometimes take place in the media, but the boundaries
 of permissible discussion are well understood in advance by
 all participants.
 The primary functions of the media are to disseminate
 government policies and viewpoints and to rally popular
 support for government programs and leading figures such as
 the President. Nigerien journalists are acutely aware of
 their status as government employees and of the guidelines
 within which they must operate. Journalists who have strayed
 from these guidelines have been demoted, fired, or otherwise
 disciplined in the past, although no such incidents occurred
 in 1987. While there are no legal constraints on academic
 freedom, in practice university students and professors are
 reluctant to speak openly about potentially controversial
 domestic issues for fear of government reprisal. There have
 been no reports of censored or banned magazines or other
 publications, but the Government is under no legal constraints
 should it discover material that it deems offensive. Foreign
 films are subject to censorship by the Ministry of Interior on
 grounds of public morality and political content.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Except for political parties, most forms of voluntary
 association, such as trade unions, churches, and other
 religious groups, function with the understanding that they
 must act in accordance with government policy. Government
 
 
 218
 NIGER
 permission is required for public gatherings, although, in
 practice, public meetings of such organizations are usually
 allowed.
 Roughly 90 percent of Niger's work force is employed in some
 aspect of agriculture or herding. In the small modern economy,
 the trade union movement is weak, and controlled and partially
 financed by the Government. All unions-are organized under a
 government-controlled umbrella group, the National Union of
 Nigerien Workers (USTN). The head of the USTN is elected by
 its members. The USTN represents about 30 percent of the
 approximately 60,000 salaried workers in Niger. Collective
 bargaining is legally authorized and is conducted by
 representatives from individual unions, employers, and the
 Government. There is a general collective bargaining
 agreement in force between the USTN, employers, and the
 Government which covers wages and benefits. However,
 individual unions are permitted to bargain for more favorable
 agreements at their work sites. The USTN is poorly financed
 partly because of government refusal to allow fund-raising
 methods such as a dues checkoff system. Strikes in Niger are
 rare, although legal if conciliation and mediation procedures
 have been exhausted. The USTN maintains relations with
 recognized international bodies, e.g., the International Labor
 Organization and the Accra-based Organization of African Trade
 Union Unity.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Niger is over 90 percent Muslim, but the Government allows the
 practice of other religious beliefs. Foreign missionaries are
 permitted to live, work, and travel in Niger. There have been
 no reports of religious discrimination. Out of respect for
 religious minorities and on political grounds, President
 Kountche vigorously resisted any suggestions for making Niger
 an Islamic Republic. The new National Charter adopted in June
 formally proclaims Niger a secular state. Religious groups
 are allowed to maintain links with coreligionists in other
 countries.
 The Government, concerned by the Islamic fundamentalist
 violence which erupts periodically in northern Nigeria,
 monitors Muslim religious activity through the Islamic
 Association. This Association is funded by the Government and
 assists in an intormal government screening process of local
 religious leaders. Islamic services that have gone beyond
 strictly religious subjects have been shut down.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Travel within Niger is closely monitored, although no special
 travel documents are required for domestic travel. Police
 checks, often entailing thorough searches, take place upon
 entering or leaving any major town or city. These checks
 reflect a governmental preoccupation with security and
 smuggling, a concern over possible movements into the country
 of foreign-based dissidents or criminal elements, and a policy
 designed to discourage migration to urban areas. Nigeriens
 wishing to travel abroad must obtain exit visas, which are
 usually granted routinely. Married women must have the
 permission of their husbands to travel abroad. The
 repatriation of Nigerien nationals is unrestricted. Niger is
 a party to the U.N. Convention and.Protocol Relating to the
 Status of Refugees and has been cooperative with respect to
 
 
 219
 NIGER
 the 14 refugees currently in Niger under the auspices of the
 U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 The capacity of the people to influence the Government is
 extremely limited. Virtually all power is held by the
 President, who derives his authority from the military. He
 rules through the Supreme Military Council which is made up of
 officers who helped stage the 1974 coup that toppled the last
 civilian regime. The President rules by decree, makes all
 governrment appointments, and controls the pace of political
 change and economic development. The transition to the new
 President had proceeded smoothly at the end of 1987 with
 little obvious change in procedures or style of governance.
 Government day-to-day operations are conducted largely by
 civilian technocrats who implement decisions promulgated by
 the Supreme Military Council and the President himself. While
 all but five ministerial positions have passed from military
 to civilian hands in recent years, all of Niger's seven
 departments have military governors, who have autocratic
 power within their departments. Moreover, there is a marked
 military presence in the upper echelons of the National
 Development Council.
 In lieu of a party system, the Government since 1979 has been
 organizing the National Development Council and subordinate
 councils at the village, regional, and departmental levels,
 which in theory will lead to greater popular participation in
 economic decisionmaking. These councils consist of elected
 and appointed members, although only at the village level are
 members elected directly by the people. The national-level
 Council consists of Nigeriens from all walks of life, who also
 serve on special committees to consider various aspects of
 economic development, cultural policy, and social issues.
 One such committee was responsible for drafting the National
 Charter which will serve as the framework for the future
 constitution.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 In recent years, inquiries from international human rights
 organizations, such as Al's 1986 letter requesting, among
 other things, information about seven detainees, have
 apparently been ignored by the Government. (In its 1987
 Report, Al noted, however, that one of the detainees mentioned
 in its letter had been released.) There are no domestic
 groups which monitor the human rights situation in Niger.
 Niger is not active in regional and international human rights
 organizations.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Four major ethnic groups, each with its own language, make up
 the bulk of the population. The two primarily nomadic groups,
 Tuaregs and Fulani (Peul), have less access to government
 services, partly because their transient lifestyles make it
 difficult for the Government to supply them with services and
 partly because of historical animosities between the nomads
 and the sedentary Djerma and Hausa ethnic groups which
 dominate the Government.
 
 
 220
 NIGER
 The essentially traditional nature of Nigerien society helps
 ensure that family and ethnic group ties remain strong and
 supportive, but traditional practices and attitudes on
 ethnicity, women, and education have some negative effects.
 Males have considerable advantages in terms of education,
 employment, and property rights. While women have the right
 to vote, Niger is notable for its dearth of women in
 senior-level government positions. In case of divorce,
 custody of all children over 7 years of age is given to the
 husband. Conscious of this situation, the Government has made
 progress in improving the status of women by launching work on
 a new family code, by providing better employment opportunities
 to women, by giving them a significant role in the National
 Development Council, and by supporting the National Women's
 Association. In 1987 the Government continued to encourage
 Nigeriens to practice family planning.
 CONDITIONS OF LABOR
 Under the Niger labor code, workers receive benefits for
 on-the-job injury, leave for family emergencies, and health
 benefits. Annual holidays and leave benefits are clearly
 defined. Children between the ages of 12 and 18 may be
 employed, but there are strict provisions concerning the hours
 and types of employment for children in this age group. The
 minimum wage (about $74 a month) applies to all sectors. In
 practice, all labor provisions, especially those concerning
 child labor, apply to urban areas and generally are enforced
 mainly in the modern, wage sector. In the agricultural
 sector, which employs most Nigeriens, children work on family
 plots under conditions which are not in compliance with the
 provisions of the labor code, and there is no attempt at
 enforcement.
