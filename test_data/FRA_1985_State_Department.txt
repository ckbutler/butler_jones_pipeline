 FRANCE
 France is a democratic republic with constitutional guarantees
 of human rights, freely functioning political parties, and
 regu.lar elections.. Voter participation (with universal
 suffrage) is high. Elections at the local as well as national
 level are occasions for ideological and topical debate.
 France has a highly developed industrial economy comprising a
 mixture of public and private enterprise. The public sector
 was increased significantly during the first year and a half
 of the Mitterrand Presidency when, in fulfillment of Socialist
 Party campaign promises, a number of important private
 industrial enterprises and most of the remaining private banks
 were nationalized. Most of the economy is still privately
 controlled, however, and no firms or banks were nationalized
 in 1985. The Government is now committed to an austerity
 program designed to reduce inflation and the costs of the
 public sector.
 The promotion of human rights remains a principal tenet of
 President Mitterrand's foreign policy. Since Mitterrand took
 office in 1981, France has signed 13 international conventions
 on human rights. French leaders speak out frequently on
 worldwide abuses of human rights and make frequent reference
 to the protection of these rights within France. Mitterrand
 and other government officials reaffirmed France's histdric
 commitment to human rights at an international conference on
 human rights and freedoms organized by Prime Minister Laurent
 Fabius in May 1985.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 Terrorist groups--principally indigenous groups--have taken
 responsibility for several political murders occurring in
 France in 1985. In January, the terrorist group Action
 Directe, in association with the West German Red Army Faction,
 claimed responsibility for the assassination of General Rene
 Audran, director of international arms sales in the French
 Defense Ministry. Five months later, Action Directe tried
 unsuccessfully to assassinate the Comptroller General of the
 French Army. The group also committed sporadic bombings
 against businesses, government offices, and international
 organizations linked in its analysis to repressive or
 militaristic activities.
 The so-called Antiterrorist Liberation Group continued to
 claim responsibility for assassinations of alleged Basque
 terrorists in southwest France in 1985, and its operations
 became less discriminating as some of the victims had no
 apparent links to Basque terrorism. The Corsican National
 Liberation Front took responsibility for the machine-gunning
 of several police headquarters and police cars, killing a
 gendarme in December 1984 in addition to numerous bombings in
 1984-85. Also responsible for bombings were the French Basque
 organization Iparretarrak, the Breton Revolutionary Army, and
 various separatist organizations in the overseas department of
 Guadeloupe whose attacks resulted in fatalities. In New
 Caledonia, an overseas territory, violence occurred
 
 
 975
 FRANCE
 sporadically during much of 1985, with more than 20 people
 killed either in confrontations between pro- and anti-
 independence forces, or in efforts by police to enforce the
 law.
 b. Disappearance
 There is no evidence that French security services have
 engaged in abduction or secret arrests.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Freedom from torture is guaranteed by law and respected in
 practice. There have been no credible allegations of the use
 of torture.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 French law guarantees freedom from arbitrary arrest and
 imprisonment. There is no direct equivalent of habeas corpus
 in the French legal system, but a suspect can be held only for
 up to 2 days--4 for drug cases--before being transferred to a
 magistrate for investigation. There is no forced or
 compulsory labor in France.
 The French judiciary plays a determining role in the detention
 process. Government authority to hold a person beyond the
 prescribed periods is severely restricted and must be ordered
 by the competent court. As part of continuing reforms in the
 legal system, the Minister of Justice in 1985 proposed a
 change in the magistrate system to require that three
 investigating magistrates rather than one agree before
 arresting and detaining a suspect for certain crimes.
 In an effort to contain violence and in response to Spanish
 Government requests, the French Government in 1985 continued
 its policy of "assigned residence," moving Spanish emigre
 Basques suspected of terrorist connections to towns in
 northern France. The Government also continued, at a lower
 rate than in past years, its policy of expelling accused
 Basque terrorists, mostly to African nations.
 The Government ordered banishment of three French citizens of
 New Caledonia from the island due to their alleged roles in
 promoting violence and racial hatred. However, authorities
 have been unable thus far to apprehend them, and they
 presumably remain in hiding in New Caledonia. The expulsion
 action was taken under a "state of siege" declared by the
 French High Commissioner, under provisions of the French
 Constitution, and was highly exceptional.
 In general, the Government sets great store by France's
 tradition as a refuge for victims of political and religious
 persecution.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The right of fair public trial is guaranteed by law and
 respected in practice. Suspects have the right to legal
 counsel as soon as their case is transferred from the police
 to the magistrate. For misdemeanors, pretrial confinement is
 limited normally to 4 months, with possible extensions in
 special circumstances not to exceed 8 months. For felonies,
 
 
 976'
 FRANCE
 pretrial confinement is not limited. French law provides for
 the right of appeal, except in jury trials of felony cases.
 An appeal in felony cases is possible to the Cour de
 Cassation, but this court rules only on procedure. No appeal
 is possible that involves review of the facts of the case.
 Trials in France are normally open and public, though
 provisions exist for the defense to request a closed
 proceeding. The press has free access to records of court
 proceedings, but under French law the prosecutor may not
 disclose information about cases being tried or investigated.
 Though the judiciary is independent, the courts are not immune
 from subtle political or public pressure in certain cases.
 There is no evidence that the authorities detain any person
 for political reasons.
 Pending completion of legislative reforms, legal proceedings
 have been suspended against individuals whose requests for '
 conscientious objector status were rejected.  There are still.
 some individuals, however, who are now serving prison terms
 imposed prior to 1983 by the now defunct permanent tribunals
 of the armed forces because they did not present such a
 request and refused military service.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 French law guarantees freedom from invasion of privacy, and
 this freedom is respected in practice. The search of a
 private residence requires a search warrant and must take
 place between 9 a.m. and 6 p.m. except in special cases, such
 as drug offenses, when the search can be undertaken at any
 time. Telephone conversations may be monitored in conjunction
 with criminal proceedings with a court order and in national
 security cases with administrative approval from the agency
 conducting the investigation. The authorities have
 occasionally opened correspondence to enforce currency
 regulations, though this is not a widespread practice.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Freedom of speech and press are guaranteed by law and
 respected in practice. Newspapers and magazines are free from
 government control and carry views ranging across the
 political spectrum. Major radio and television stations are
 state-owned, though the Government is not directly involved in
 their daily operation. These media are subject to the
 jurisdiction of a "high authority" whose members are appointed
 by the President, the National Assembly, and the Senate.
 Since 1983, private "free" radio stations have been in
 operation, many of which are sympathetic to the current
 political opposition. The Government has announced plans to
 allow the establishment of private television channels.
 Allegations of government pressure on television and radio
 continue to be heard and denied. In practice, government
 ownership of the audiovisual media do not seem to represent a
 limitation of press freedoms.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Freedom of peaceful assembly and association is
 constitutionally guaranteed and respected in practice.
 
 
 FRANCE
 Labor unions have the right to organize free from government
 control. Although only one-fifth of labor is unionized, trade
 unions exercise significant economic and political influence.
 They are present and active in numerous tripartite
 (government, employers, and labor) bodies dealing with social
 matters, including labor courts and the Economic and Social
 Council, a constitutionally mandated consultative body. All
 unions are technically independent of the political parties,
 but many of the leaders of France's largest union, the General
 Confederation of Labor, belong to the Communist Party (the
 General Secretary traditionally is a member of the Communist
 Party Political Bureau). Leaders of most other unions are
 members of one or another faction of the governing Socialist
 Party although members of other parties are also active in the
 labor movement. Despite this, all unions and employers
 associations are very active in the International Labor
 Organization and other international organizations. French
 workers are free to strike, with a few minor exceptions where
 strikes are determined to be a threat to public safety.
 During the summer of 1985 the General Confederation of Labor
 undertook a series of increasingly provocative "commando"
 actions such as blocking rail lines and major city streets and
 occupying factories. Despite considerable provocation
 including physical attacks against the police, the Government
 so far has succeeded in ending these actions with a minimum of
 force.
 The only major abridgment of freedom of assembly in 1985 came
 in New Caledonia, where widespread disorder and violence led
 the French High Commissioner to impose a state of siege and a
 curfew. During the summer the situation became somewhat
 calmer in anticipation of regional elections, and the state of
 siege was ended. Regional elections took place without major
 incident in September.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Roman Catholics comprise by far the largest religious group in
 France. Separation of church and state is guaranteed by law.
 All religious groups function freely without persecution or
 restrictions. Despite strong initial public opposition to
 proposed legislation regarding private (largely Catholic)
 schools, the Government in 1984-85 succeeded in passing
 compromise education reform measures which allow public
 authorities some say in private school personnel practices.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 French law provides for freedom of internal movement, foreign
 travel, emigration, and repatriation. Arriving refugees,
 intending emigrants, and intending repatriates can undertake
 foreign travel and, in most instances, return to France.
 Although new measures to control immigration announced in 1984
 could, among other things, sharply restrict the right of some
 aliens to settle their families there, France has an extensive
 record of refugee aid and resettlement.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 The Constitution guarantees the equality of all citizens
 before the law, without regard to origin, race, or religion.
 
 
 978
 FRANCE
 All French citizens of both sexes who have reached majority
 may vote. These provisions are fully respected in practice.
 A wide variety of political parties compete freely in
 elections. In addition to national, presidential, and
 legislative elections, there are regularly scheduled local
 elections. For several years, the Government has been
 transferring selected powers from the executive branch to the
 locally elected assemblies. Many special interest
 groups--business, labor, veterans, consumer advocates,
 ecologists, and others--organize freely and regularly run
 candidates for elective office. While isolated incidents of
 racial, religious, or political discrimination occur,
 particularly against the large immigrant community, the
 authorities do not condone them. The Government passed a law
 in 1985 guaranteeing a vote on self-determination in New
 Caledonia before the end of 1987.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 France has traditionally been a leader in the human rights
 area and has long been a member of the United Nations Human
 Rights Commission. Human rights organizations operate freely
 in France, including Amnesty International, the International
 Federation for Human Rights, and the International Institute
 for Human Rights.
 In its 1985 Report (covering the year 1984), Amnesty
 International expressed continued concern about the
 imprisonment of conscientious objectors. Freedom House rated
 France "free."
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 France has an advanced industrial mixed economy accompanied by
 a system of social assistance to needy members of the
 population. Its population is 55,041,000, and its per capita
 gross national product was $10,500 in 1983.
 Discrimination based on race, religion, sex, ethnic
 background, or political opinion is not condoned by the
 authorities. Food, shelter, health care, and education are
 available to all inhabitants. Life expectancy at birth is
 74.9 years, and the infant mortality rate is 8.2 per 1,000
 live births. The adult literacy rate is 99 percent.
 With a few minor exceptions for those enrolled in recognized
 apprenticeship programs, children under the age of 16 may not
 be employed. Certain categories of work considered to be
 arduous and night work (10 p.m. to 5 a.m.) may not be
 performed by persons under the age of 18, or by women in
 manufacturing, mining, the public sector, unions, and
 nonprofit organizations, with the exception of women with
 managerial responsibilities. This prohibition does not apply
 to women in commercial establishments or the health sector
 where no manual work is involved.
 France has a minimum wage of about $3.00 an hour. The
 standard work week is 39 hours, and overtime is controlled.
 In general terms, French labor legislation and practice,
 including that pertaining to occupational safety and health,
 are fully compatible with those in other industrialized market
 economy countries. The minimum wage is somewhat less in the
 
 
 979
 FRANCE
 overseas departments, and not all social legislation applies
 in the overseas territories.
 Women have equal status under the law, but they remain engaged
 in continuing efforts to maintain and strengthen their
 rights. A Cabinet-level ministry is charged with promoting
 women's rights. The Government has taken steps to close
 loopholes in French legislation on sex discrimination in the
 workplace and to eliminate sexist advertising. In 1985 it
 passed legislation to ensure more equality in marriage rights.
 The current Government has made a major effort to recognize
 the rights of linguistic and ethnic minorities, whether in
 metropolitan France Or overseas. In August it announced
 measures to foster the study of regional languages such as
 Breton. It has also shown itself sensitive to the rights of
 immigrants, emphasizing the need to coexist peacefully without
 forcing them to assimilate completely into French culture.
 In New Caledonia, the Government has worked constantly to
 reassure the Melanesian sector of the population that its
 rights and customs will be respected. Deep-rooted antagonisms
 between ethnic communities still exist, however, leaving a
 potential for violence. Further exceptional measures by the
 Government could be required, such as during the previous
 "state of siege." Similarly, there is a potential for renewed
 violence in the overseas department of Guadeloupe, where
 rioting and a general strike paralyzed the island for several
 days in July.
