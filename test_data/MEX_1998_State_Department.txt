 MEXICO
 Mexico is a federal republic composed of 31 states and a Federal District, with
 an elected President and a bicameral legislature. President Ernesto Zedillo was
 elected in 1994 to a single 6-year term. The Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI),
 the oldest and largest political party, enjoys significant advantages in patronage, in-
 cumbency, and fund-raising. However, in largely free and fair elections in 1997, the
 PRI lost its absolute majority in the lower house for the first time, and the opposi-
 tion Democratic Revolutionary Party (PRD) and National Action Party (PAN) made
 strong gains. State election commissions have recast state and local elections into
 free and generally honest contests. The opposition, the PRI, and the Government
 demonstrated an ability to work together in the Congress on vital national issues.
 Politically motivated violence plagued several southern states, especially Chiapas,
 Guerrero, and Oaxaca. Peace talks between the Government and the Zapatista Na-
 tional Liberation Army (EZLN) remained stalemated. The EZLN and the Congres-
 sional Commission on Peace and Harmony in Chiapas (COCOPA) met in November
 and agreed to maintain contact. The judiciary is generally independent; however, on
 occasion it has been influenced by the executive branch.

 The military shares responsibility for internal security with the police forces,
 which include the federal and state judicial police, the federal highway police, the
 municipal police, and various police auxiliary forces. Elected civilian officials control
 the military and police. The military withdrew from Federal District police respon-
 sibilities in December 1997. Corruption is widespread within police ranks and a
 growing problem for the military. Military personnel and police officers continued
 to commit serious human rights abuses.
 The Government continued to deregulate and open the market-based, mixed econ-
 omy. In 1997 social and community services contributed 26.2 percent to the gross
 domestic product (GDP), manufacturing 20 percent, and agriculture 5.2 percent.
 One-fourth of the population reside in rural areas where subsistence agriculture is
 common. Leading exports included petroleum, automobiles, and manufactured and
 assembled products (including electronics and consumer goods). Per capita GDP in
 1998 was about $4,420. Consumption and wages, while slowly rising, remained
 below 1994 levels, contributing to high crime rates and social tension. Approxi-
 mately 40 million persons live below the official poverty level, of whom 22 million
 qualified for government assistance because they are extremely poor. According to
 .official statistics in February, 49.6 percent of urban workers earned no more than
 twice the daily minimum wage. The top 20 percent of the population received over
 50 percent of total income, while the bottom 20 percent earned less than 5 percent.
 The Government generally respected the human rights of its citizens, although se-
 rious problems remained in some areas and some states present special concerns.
 Continued serious abuses included extrajudicial killings, disappearances, torture,
 police corruption, poor prison conditions, arbitrary arrest and detention, lengthy
 pretrial detention, lack of due process, judicial inefficiency and corruption, illegal
 searches, attacks against journalists, assaults and threats against human rights
 monitors, violence against women, discrimination against women and indigenous
 people, child prostitution and abuse, limits on worker rights, and extensive child
 ab or in agriculture and the informal economy. Reports of vigilante violence de-
 creased.
 Reforms in the administration of justice proceeded and intensified as the Federal
 Judicial Council created new tribunals and established merit-based hiring and pro-
 motion procedures; however, the Government had limited success ending the culture
 of impunity that pervades the security forces. The Government continued to fund
 the National Human Rights Commission (CNDH), which investigates complaints of
 abuse and makes recommendations to the Government. The Government imple-
 mented many of them, including prosecuting some abusers and sanctioning others.
 Guerrilla attacks against government buildings and personnel continued, and
 often resulted in loss of life and injuries.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-Members of the security forces, both
 the military and police, committed extrajudicial killings. The states of Guerrero,
 Morelos, and Nuevo Leon were the scenes of the most notorious cases. In the most
 politically significant incident, the head of the Morelos state antikidnaping police
 unit was arrested on January 28 while trying to dump the body of Jorge ava
 Aviles, whom the police apparently had detained, tortured, and killed. The state at-
 torney general and police chief also were implicated in the case and were arrested
 on March 8. They awaited trial at year's end. Constant pressure from local non-
 governmental organizations (NGO's), massive public demonstrations, and a CNDH
 report highly critical of the Morelos state government led the state legislature to
 initiate impeachment proceedings against Governor Jorge Carrillo Olea, which con-
 tributed to his de facto resignation on May 18.
 On February 26, Gerardo Villarreal Rodriguez died in Nuevo Leon, after being
 tortured by four state police officers. His body was discovered the next day in a shal-
 low grave. A local television station broadcast a taped conversation in which state
 police chief Americo Melendez Reyna asked the state attorney general for help in
 covering up the crime. Melendez Reyna immediately left office.
 In Chiapas violence and volatility continued in the aftermath of the December 22,
 1997, Acteal massacre (see Section 1.g.). On January 12, panicky state police in
 Ocosingo, Chiapas, opened fire on rock-throwing demonstrators protesting the mas-
 sacre. One demonstrator was killed and a small child was wounded as police fled
 the scene. A nearby military unit established a roadblock and quickly detained the
 22 state police involved in the incident. Although videotape showed at least three
 police officers shooting at demonstrators, by June all but one of the accused had
 een released, and he was charged only with malicious wounding. The case was
 
 
 686
 pending at year's end. In Chavajeval, Chiapas, eight apparent EZLN partisans and
 two state police officers were killed on June 10 in an exchange of fire when mem-
 bers of the police and the military attempted to enter the village to execute arrest
 warrants. A total of 9 persons were wounded and 53 were arrested in this and 2
 other law enforcement operations at El Bosque and Union Progreso (see Section
 1.g.).
 On June 7, in El Charco, Guerrero, army troops killed 12 alleged members of the
 rebel Revolutionary Army of the People's Insurgency (ERPI), a breakaway faction
 of the Popular Revolutionary Army (EPR), in a firefight. Five individuals were
 wounded and 22 were arrested (see Section 1.g.).
 On June 19, officers detained seven members of the Grupo Beta police unit follow-
 ing the killing of an alleged migrant smuggler. Officials are investigating whether
 the victim was killed after he had been detained and whether evidence was planted
 on him.
 In four 1997 cases-those in Acteal, Buenos Aires, Zapopan, and San Pedro
 Nixtalucumn-the Government had mixed investigative and prosecutorial success.
 Following the Acteal massacre, federal Government Secretary Emilio Chuayffet
 Chemor (the ranking cabinet member responsible for Chiapas policy) and Chiapas
 Governor Julio Cesar Ruiz Ferro resigned. On January 8, the CNDH found state
 government officials culpable for failing to respond to initial reports of the massacre
 and negligent in their investigation of past incidents. It called for the resignation
 of the Chiapas secretary of government, the state attorney general, and several
 high-ranking poice officials. The new governor accepted the CND'Is recommenda-
 tions, and most of those officials resigned. Due to the seriousness of the case, as
 well as signs that state officials were involved in a coverup, the federal Attorney
 General's office (PGR) took over the investigation. The PGR interviewed the former
 governor and state officials named by the CNDH. It also requested 129 arrest war-
 rants, of which the judiciar granted 116.
 On December 20, the P R issued a report attributing the Acteal massacre to a
 history of confrontations between communities in Chenalho, the existence of an ille-
 gal EZLN municipal council in Chenalho, the neglect of local authorities responsible
 or the administration of justice, and the absence of the rule of law in the area. The
 Attorney General also -announced that 16 civilian groups were being investigated
 and that 32 arrest warrants were pending service. Critics of the report stated that
 the victims had never been part of the intracommunity conflict in Chenalho.
 At year's end, in criminal and administrative proceedings related to the Acteal
 massacre, a court had convicted seven state police officers of violating a federal fire-
 arms law and sentenced them to over 3 years in prison. Ninety suspects remained
 in jail and trials were continuing at yea~s end. The Chiapas state comptroller gen-
 eral banned 11 former state officials from holding a state office for an unspecified
 period of time, including the former secretary of government, the former attorney
 general, and a retired brigadier general who was a coordinator for the state police
 at the time of the massacre.
 Trial proceedings continued for 25 of the 35 security force personnel from the Jag-
 uar and Fox units charged with killing six persons on September 8, 1997, in the
 Buenos Aires neighborhood in Mexico City. On June 3, the authorities released
 three high-ranking military officers, including Lieutenant Colonel Moctezuma
 Ilhuicamina Rodriguez Aepeda, Director of the Jaguar unit, Colonel Jesus Alonso
 Valdez, motorcycle police chief, and Abrosio Cruz Martinez, a group chief, despite
 evidence that placed all three officials at the scene of the crime. On June 5, the Fed-
 eral District Superior Court ruled that 10 of the 35 jailed police would be released
 due to insufficient evidence. On June 15, the authorities indicted Brigadier General
 Mauro Tello Quinones, task force coordinator, on charges of homicide. General Jose
 Lamberto Ponce Lara, whose bus at the crime scene contained bloody footprints, re-
 mained in custody. The case was pending at year's end.
 Twenty-eight soldiers remained in custody for the December 14-15, 1997, kidnap-
 ing, torture, and murder of 23-year-old Salvador Jimenez Aguilar in Zapopan mu-
 nicipality, Jalisco. On January 10, the president of the Guadalajara human rights
 commission and the state attorney general visited the La Mojonera military base
 in Ocotan, near Zapopan, where the soldiers were being detained. They reviewed the
 evidence against the accused and judged the military criminal justice process "a fair
 one." The case was pending at year's end.
 There were no new developments in the investigation into the March 1997 inci-
 dent at San Pedro Nixtalucum, El Bosque municipality, Chiapas, in which police
 killed 4 persons and detained 24 others during a confrontation between PRI sup-
 porters and opponents.
 There were localized incidents of vigilante killings and violence. In Huejutla, Hi-
 dalgo, a mob numbering up to 1,000 persons lynched two presumed kidnapers, set
 
 
 fire to the courthouse, and burned five patrol cars on the evening of March 25. Ear-
 lier that day, passersby had seized the victims as they allegedly attempted to kid-
 nap four young girls. After the authorities assumed custody of the suspects, a radio
 station incited public anger by falsely broadcasting that the suspects had planned
 to sell the girls in Texas and were about to be released on bail. Arriving at the riot
 scene, the Governor attempted to calm the crowd, but when that failed he ordered
 state police to arrest 17 members of the mob. At year's end, the 17 persons were
 awaiting trial on charges ranging from public disturbance and destruction of public
 property to murder.
 There were EPR guerrilla attacks in Oaxaca and Guerrero. EZLN guerrillas com-
 mitted several killings (see Section 1.g.).
 In December the authorities concluded the trial of Raul Salinas de Gortari, broth-
 er of former president Carlos Salinas, on charges of being the intellectual author
 of the 1994 murder of PRI leader Jose Francisco Ruiz Massieu. Salinas maintained
 his innocence; a verdict was expected in early 1999.
 In the 1994 Ejido Morelia case, where the army was alleged to have tortured and
 executed three men in Chiapas, the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights
 (IACHR) determined on March 6 that the Government's inquiry was incomplete and
 recommended, among other things, that the Government appoint a special prosecu-
 tor, punish the guilty, and indemnify the families of the victims. The IACHR sched-
 uled a follow up hearing in October; the Government decided not to attend because
 the matter was "closed."
 b. Disappearance.-There were credible reports by a group of NGO's including
 Amnesty International (AI) of an increase in disappearances in the 1990's, although
 the CNDH reported receiving a decrease in complaints for the first 5 months of the
 year. Al reported that after the widespread reports of disappearances in the late
 1970's and early 1980's, the number of cases had dropped dramatically. However,
 since 1994 there has been a significant increase in new cases. Al reported that most
 disappearances took place in a counterinsurgency or antinarcotics context and found
 evidence of police involvement strong or incontrovertible. Some victims reappeared
 weeks later bearing signs of torture, according to AL. Other victims were killed.
 Members of the security forces were responsible for disappearances, some of which
 included torture and the death of victims (see Sections l.a. and 1.c.). In Chiapas on
 August 11, the attempted kidnaping of a wealthy rancher by state police officers
 was foiled by the army's rural guard. In Jalisco on August 27, the operations chief
 for the state directorate of public safety was detained on charges of kidnaping.
 In July the Miguel Agustin pro Juarez (PRODH) human rights center, 10 other
 NGO's, and the PRD party published a report on 1996-98 disappearances that as-
 serted that the security forces or armed civilian groups were responsible in the ma-
 jority of 97 disappearance cases.
 Statistics compiled by the CNDH's office on disappearances showed an increase
 in the 1990's. There were 437 disappearances reported so far in the 1990's, com-
 pared with 127 in the 1980's and 536 in the 1970's. According to the CNDH, which
 only seeks to locate those missing, the success rate in locating persons who have
 disappeared, either confirming their death or finding them alive, was 51 percent in
 the 1990's, compared with 31 percent in the 1980's, and 18 percent in the 1970's.
 The Commission received 13 reports of disappearances from January 1 to May 31
 and located all but 2 of the victims.
 Since 1993, according to the director of the Association of Families of Disappeared
 Persons, 198 persons have disappeared in Chihuahua state, particularly around
 Ciudad Juarez. The association alleged that the security forces were behind many
 of the disappearances and argued that the cases had not been investigated properly
 for that reason. In fact, an investigation supervised by the first three special pros-
 ecutors ended after members of an elite, specially trained PGR police unit, sent to
 Ciudad Juarez to assist the prosecutors, were themselves arrested in May for kid-
 naping and other serious crimes in Chihuahua. Nevertheless, the authorities denied
 the association's charges and claimed that the disappearances were connected to
 drug trafficking. In February the association provided the press with a list of offi-
 cials who allegedly participated in kidnapings. The association reported that the
 PGR agreed to appoint a fourth special prosecutor to investigate the disappearances.
 There was no progress in the investigations of the 1995 disappearances of peasant
 leader Gilberto Romero Vasquez or journalist and human         rights activist
 Cuauhtemoc Ornelas Campos.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution prohibits torture; however, it continues to be a serious problem.
 Although the Constitution excludes as evidence confessions obtained in the absence
 of the accused's defense attorney, and the law excludes coerced confessions, includ-
 ing those extracted under torture, police regularly obtain information through tor-
 
 
 688
 
 ture, and prosecutors use this evidence in courts. In addition to the constitutional
 prohibition, the Federal District and all states, except Hidalgo, prohibit torture.
 However, members of the security forces continued to torture and abuse detainees;
 at times such torture resulted in the death of the victims (see Section 1.a.). The
 most commonly used methods of torture were threats, beatings, asphyxiation, and
 electric shock.
 There are persistent reports by NGO's of widespread uses of torture by the police
 and the security forces. Nigel Rodley, the United Nations Special Rapporteur on
 Torture, reported in January that torture continues to occur despite the fact that
 the country has in place an array of legal safeguards. NGO's reported extensive use
 of torture by the security forces, particularly against suspected guerrillas (see Sec-
 tion l.g.). The IACHR report described evidence of torture of alleged EZLN mem-
 bers.
 The CNDH reported that complaints of torture rose to 58 in 1997-98, a 26 percent
 increase over the previous year. Responding to these complaints, the CNDH issued
 five recommendations to the military, two to the PGR, one to the federal prison di-
 rector, and eight more to various state governments. The CNDH does not maintain
 statistics on torture complaints made to state human rights commissions. Poorly
 trained and ill-equipped to investigate crimes, police officers continued to attempt
 to solve crimes by rounding up likely suspects and then exacting confessions from
 them. Many state human rights commissions received reports of torture allegedly
 committed by police.
 For example, a defense attorney in Tuxtla Gutierrez, Chiapas, accused state police
 of torturing 27 Tzotzile Indians arrested during the police operation in El Bosque
 municipality on June 10 (see Section 1.g.). The attorney contended that police were
 seeking information on the EZLN and forced the Indians to confess to crimes they
 did not commit.
 In another case; Erika Zamora and Efren Cortes, who were captured by the mili-
 tary during the July 7 incident at El Charco, Guerrero, maintained that they were
 tortured at army headquarters in Acapulco, Guerrero, and forced to sign prepared
 confessions (see Section 1.g.).
 The authorities punish few officials for torture. Prosecution of torture cases was
 hampered by the reluctance of many of the alleged victims to file formal charges
 out of apparent fear of reprisal. However, in recent prominent cases, public officials
 have been sanctioned for employing torture. In Morelos the head of a state police
 antikidnaping unit, the state chief of police, and the state attorney general were ar-
 rested after being implicated in torture (see Section l.a.). Nuevo Leon's state judicial
 police chief was fired after trying to cover up torture and murder committed by four
 of his officers (see Section l.a.). In Mexico City former federal police chief Adrian
 Carrera Fuentes was sentenced on July 1 to 4 years in prison for torturing Fer-
 nando Rodriguez Gonzalez and Maria Rodriguez Arauz, two witnesses in the Ruiz
 Massieu murder investigation. In addition, the federal Comptroller General barred
 Carrera Fuentes from holding public office for 30 years and imposed penalties rang-
 ing from 10 to 20 years' imprisonment on a former PGR inspector general and nine
 other former PGR officials for participating in or permitting the torture.
 Government officials conceded the country's serious human rights shortcomings.
 In a February 19 speech, Attorney General Jorge Madrazo, a former CNDH presi-
 dent, acknowledged that human rights were violated during his tenure, but he
 pointed to the jailing of over 200 officials as evidence of his commitment to root out
 corrupt police officers. Similarly, on March 4, the Executive Secretary of the na-
 tional public safety system (part of the Government Secretariat) admitted that po-
 lice corruption was a serious problem. CNDH president Mireille Roccatti testified
 to Congress on July 30 that human rights violations continued, perpetrated mainly
 by the police.
 These admissions coincided with several cases that made police corruption impos-
 sible to ignore. Federal police in Chihuahua state were arrested on kidnaping
 charges in January, May, and June. The police detained in May were supposedly
 assisting prosecutors investigating disappearance cases (see Section 1.b.). In Sinaloa
 federal police were arrested in June for extortion and organized crime.
 The IACHR report described a definite pattern of rape and sexual assault commit-
 ted by state agents. The Commission stated that it had received information indicat-
 ing that some women, particularly those in detention, are the victims of sexual as-
 sault either by or with the consent of state agents. In Mexico City, three teenaged
 girls charged on July 19 that they had been kidnaped, raped, and held prisoner in
 a stable for at least 3 days by members of the Mexico City mounted police. In re-
 sponse, the authorities held 15 policemen in custody and charged at least 9 of them
 with rape and kidnaping. Threats from the policemen's families and sharp question-
 ing by defense lawyers caused two of the girls to recant their testimony during the
 
 
 689
 first phase of the trial in September. While the ensuing public criticism forced local
 prosecutors to provide more support for the girls, the incident reflected the common
 plight of rape victims in the judicial system (also see Section 5).
 On July 30, five prostitutes presented a complaint against the Mexico City attor-
 ney general's office (PGJDF) for refusing to attend to a case in which a prostitute
 accused 15 police officers of rape. Mexico City's attorney general ordered an inves-
 tigation. In December a woman reported that she had been raped by a guard during
 her first day at the Eighth Street jail in Tijuana. After she declined to press charges
 for fear of reprisals, prison authorities filed a criminal complaint against the guard.
 An NGO report alleged that police were responsible for 35 percent of attacks on
 journalists (see Section 2.a.). Police sometimes beat and robbed illegal immigrants
 (see Section 2.d.). Police also fired on protesters on one occasion (see Sections L.a.
 and 2.b.).
 The director of the Federal District's professional training institute declared that
 200 police and civilian employees of the PGJDF were under investigation for corrup-
 tion, 80 of whom already had been discharged. Mexico City Mayor Cuauhtemoc
 Cardenas pledged to clean up the city's police, but several of his appointees to high
 police posts resigned when old charges of corruption and human rights abuses re-
 surfaced.
 The PGJDF reported an average of 679 crimes, 465 of them violent, every day.
 These numbers notwithstanding, real crime levels were almost certainly higher. A
 researcher at the Metropolitan Autonomous National University found that 70 per-
 cent of Mexico City's crime went unreported and that 77 percent of adults had been
 or knew someone who had been the victim of a violent crime in the past year. Most
 citizens view the police as corrupt and unhelpful and believe that the justice system
 in general is also corrupt, contributing to the high number of crimes that go unre-
 ported.
 Faced with this crisis, the authorities attempted to reform the justice system. The
 PGR reorganized, increased its efforts to root out corruption, provided better train-
 ing to law enforcement personnel, and administered background and polygraph tests
 to approximately 1,200 agents in special units. In February Attorney General
 Madrazo announced that he would work with state attorneys general to profes-
 sionalize the police. Mexico City attorney general Samuel de Villar started training
 programs on August 17 for the PGJDF's 8,800 police and civilian officials. The Gov-
 ernment announced a national public safety plan on August 26 that, among other
 things, proposed to deal with corruption and the lack of training by weeding out cor-
 rupt police and creating a national training academy. In November the authorities
 arrested 87 police officers and private security guards with outstanding arrest war-
 rants in Mexico City and three adjoining states, as part of a national program to
 purge police and private security companies of possible criminals.
 In some cases police officers dismissed in one state find law enforcement employ-
 ment in another. The CNDH discovered that even when the authorities censured
 some officers in one law enforcement job, they moved on to other positions and were
 subsequently charged again with human rights abuses. In an effort to remedy this
 situation, the CNDH publishes lists of censured public servants in its annual report
 and monthly newsletters. In addition, the Government has established a national
 security register to keep track of censured police officers and address this problem,
 but it has not been in existence long enough to have its effectiveness measured; no
 results have been reported.
 On January 31, PGR elements raided the home of the Marianist Brothers, a
 Rome-based Catholic religious order dedicated to education. The Marianist Brothers
 are teachers at a junior high and high school in Tijuana. The raid on the Marianist
 home was part of an operation against five homes in the Lomas area of Tijuana.
 Despite the arrest of a possible drug cartel g an at one home, the bungled raid
 on the religious home triggered a wave of public protest over PGR methods and tac-
 tics. Public anger over the raid was widespread and vocal, including newspaper ad-
 vertisements by the religious and business community that criticized PGR tactics.
 Prison conditions are poor. Prison guards often are poorly trained and corrupt,
 prison facilities inadequate and overcrowded, and drug and alcohol use rampant.
 Prisoners complained that they must purchase food, medicine, and other necessities
 from guards or bribe guards to allow the goods to be provided by family and friends.
 Some prisoners usurped the authority of prison officials and coerced other prisoners
 by means of influence peddling, drug and arms trafficking, violence, sexual abuse,
 and protection payoffs. Conflicts between rival prison gangs, often involved in drug
 trafficking, continued to spark lethal violence. While the authorities investigate
 some prison officials for abusing prisoners, they more commonly dismiss those who
 commit abuses or charge them with only minor offenses.
 
 
 On April 14, a riot broke out at Reclusorio Preventivo prison in Puente Grande,
 Jalisco. According to press reports, over 100 inmates were injured in the incident.
 The prison is overcrowded, underbudgeted, and understaffed.
 The penal system comprises 441 faclities: 4 federal penitentiaries, 8 Federal Dis-
 trict prisons, 280 state prisons, and 149 municipal jails. The prison system nation-
 wide suffered from 22 percent overcrowding, according to the Secretariat of Govern-
 ment. The most overcrowded facilities were Mexico City's Reclusorio Norte prison
 at 256 percent above designed capacity and Reclusoro Oriente prison, at 189 per-
 cent. There is one "model" prison in Cidad Ayala, Morelos. It is for men only, offers
 rehabilitative workshops and activities, and a prisoner-staffed cafeteria.
 In July Federal Districtprison director Carlos Tornero Diaz affirmed that Mexico
 City had complied with 94 percent of the recommendations from the Federal Dis-
 trict's human rights commission. However, he admitted that guards supply 40 per-
 cent of the illegal drugs smuggled into the prisons and that inmates lacked suffi-
 cient drinking water.
 Although the Constitution calls for separation of juveniles from older prisoners,
 men from women, and convicted criminals from detainees held in custody, inprac-
 tice these requirements were routinely violated as a result of overcrowding and cor-
 ruption. Moreover, prison officials not only encouraged sexual liaisons between fe-
 male inmates and male prisoners and guards, but also coerced female inmates into
 sexual relationships.
 From May 1997 to May 1998, the CNDH conducted 224 visits to 89 prisons in
 27 states to inspect the facilities and investigate prisoner complaints. There is no
 specific law or regulation regarding the ability of NGO's to visit prisons; however,
 in practice such visits are aowed and are common. For example, the Democratic
 Lawyers National Front provided legal representation to inmates suspected of EZLN
 affiliation, and its representatives were allowed to visit their clients in prison. In
 May the Government and the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC)
 signed an agreement that allows the ICRC to expand its prison visits to Chiapas.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution prohibits arbitrary ar-
 rest and detention; however, the police and prosecutors continued to detain citizens
 arbitrarily. Arbitrary arrest and detention were among the most common human
 rights abuses. Legally, a prosecutor may hold a detainee no more than 48 hours be-
 fore he must present the accused to a judge, except when the accused is caught in
 the act or within 72 hours of committing a crime.
 The Constitution provides that the authorities must sentence an accused person
 within 4 months of detention if the alleged crime carries a sentence of less than 2
 years or within 1 year if the crime carries a longer sentence. These periods can be
 extended if the parties agree. In practice, judicial and police authorities frequently
 ignored these time limits. Criminal defendants often were held with convicted pris-
 oners. Furthermore, many detainees reported that judicial officials often solicited
 bribes in exchange for not pressing charges. Those able to pay were released from
 custody. Corruption is rampant throughout the system.
 In December Congress, reacting to a significant increase in crime, passed a legal
 reform bill that among other things made it easier for the police to arrest suspects
 without warrants. The provision was one of a series of reforms intended to enhance
 the enforcement and counternarcotics capabilities of the law enforcement authori-
 ties.
 By May 31, the CNDH had received 198 complaints of arbitrary detention. Most
 of these complaints came from indigenous communities, many of which allegedly
 had links to the EZLN or the EPR. Of the 22 persons detained in El Charco, Guer-
 rero, after the June 7 clash between the army and the ERPI (see Section 1.g.), all
 but 2 were released for lack of evidence. The PRODH reported that 4 of the original
 22 detainees were minors, who were held incommunicado until July 20.
 In Chiapas the majority of detainees who complained of arbitrary arrest were ap-
 prehended in connection with the razing of self-proclaimed autonomous municipali-
 ties (see Section 1.g.). On May 15, the CNDH determined that 16 persons had been
 arbitrarily detained following a combined federal-state police dismantling of such an
 entity in Taniperlas, Ocosingo in April. The CNDH recommended that the charges
 against the 16 detainees be dropped, but state authorities ignored that rec-
 ommendation. Human rights NGO's, such as the National Network of Human
 Rights Organizations, All Rights for All, and the PRODH, determined that the 16
 persons were being detained for political reasons. On April 19, the authorities freed
 four on bail and dropped the serious charges against them. On July 14, the Chiapas
 supreme court dismissed some of the charges against nine others and on September
 2 released an additional four on bail. One additional detainee was released on Octo-
 ber 30. Seven of the original 16 persons arrested were still in custody at year's end,
 even though 5 are eligible for bail.

 Gerardo Demesa Padilla, who was arrested in connection with community efforts
 to block construction of a golf course in Tepoztlan, Morelos, was convicted in 1997
 of being an accessory to manslaughter. After the CNDH recommended his release
 because of the lack of credible evidence, a judge released him in May.
 Judges often failed to sentence indigenous detainees within legally mandated peri-
 ods. For the period from June 1994 to December 1996, the CNDH reviewed 8,661
 files of indigenous persons who were detained. The Commission recommended the
 immediate release of 1,727 persons in 1996. By the end of 1996, the authorities had
 released 998 of them; 729 cases were still pending. Of those states with the largest
 numbers of indigenous prisoners, the CNDH reviewed 2,222 cases in Oaxaca, and
 recommended 407 releases, of which 296 have been accomplished; 1,219 cases in
 Veracruz, with 331 recommendations for release and 245 releases; and 639 cases in
 Puebla, with 157 releases recommended, and 61 releases.
 Federal prosecutors continued to adhere to the recommendation by the National
 Indigenous Institute (INI) that they drop charges against first-time offenders ac-
 cused of drug cultivation, as drug traffickers often forced indigenous defendants,
 who do not understand the legal significance of their actions, to grow the crops. The
 INI also supports programs to provide translators for indigenous defendants and to
 assist them in obtaining bail bonds.
 The law does not permit exile, and it is not practiced.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The judiciary is generally independent; however,
 on occasion it has been influenced by the executive branch. Corruption and ineffi-
 ciency are problems and are more widespread in some states than others. Although
 the Zedillo administration generally respected the judiciary, past administrations
 did not always respect the judiciary's independence. The judiciary also suffers from
 inefficiency, an antiquated Legal Code, lack of training, and corruption; problems
 were more serious in some states than in others.
 The federal court system consists of a Supreme Court, 91 circuit courts of appeal,
 49 courts of appeal, and 185 district courts.
 Efforts to implement the 1995 judicial reforms continued. As chief agent of those
 reforms, the Federal Judicial Council created 53 new tribunals and established a
 merit-based procedure for selecting new judges and promoting and transferring cur-
 rent ones. It also reviewed the performance of 83 probationary magistrates and de-
 nied life tenure to 12. Authorities did not investigate any judges during the year,
 and no progress was reported in any ongoing investigations.
 Based on the Napoleonic Code, the trial system consists of a series of fact-gather-
 ing hearings at which the court receives documentary evidence or testimony. Court
 officials may add notarized documents (that are not authenticated) into the case file.
 A judge in chambers reviews the case fie and then issues a final, written ruling.
 The record of the proceeding is not available to the public; only the parties have
 access to the official fie, although by special motion the victim may have access to
 it.
 The Constitution provides for the right of the accused to attend the hearings and
 challenge the evidence or testimony presented, and the Government respects these
 rights in practice. In general, court hearings are open to the public and it is common
 to find not only the accused, but also relatives of the accused and journalists in the
 courtroom.
 Despite the constitutional right to an attorney at all stages of the criminal pro-
 ceedings, in practice the authorities often did not ensure adequate representation
 for many poor defendants. Attorneys were not always available when a police officer
 or a prosecutor questioned the accused. Sometimes a defense attorney may attempt
 to represent several clients simultaneously by going to different rooms to certify a
 formal appearance, despite not having attended the full proceedings. A new public
 defender law passed in mid-1997 improved that system in the federal courts and
 created a federal Public Defender Institute. In the case of indigenous defendants,
 many of whom do not speak Spanish, the situation is often worse. Although the
 right of the accused to a translator is implied in the Constitution and provided for
 under Federal District and federal law, courts do not routinely furnish translators
 at all stages of the criminal proceedings.
 The law does not require civil trial of soldiers involved in civil crimes, and the
 military continues to handle such cases. The Constitution provides for military juris-
 diction for crimes or offenses involving any violation of military discipline. In cases
 in which a member of the military commits a crime and is arrested by civil authori-
 ties, the military has the right to immediately request transfer of the case to mili-
 tary jurisdiction, as was done in the Guadalajara case (see Section L.a.). The Con-
 stitution allows civilian authorities to assume jurisdiction in cases involving military
 personnel accused of common offenses.
 
 
 On December 18, approximately 50 members of the armed forces marched in Mex-
 ico City to protest what they believed to be an unfair military justice system. Al-
 though the number of marchers was small, a public protest by active-duty military
 personnel was highly unusual. The authorities charged the leader of the group with
 desertion, and subsequently arrested five lieutenants who participated in the march
 and charged them with sedition.
 Some human rights groups claim that activists arrested in connection with land
 disputes and other civil disobedience activities are in fact political prisoners. The
 Government asserts that the system fairly prosecutes those charged in sometimes
 violent land invasions for common crimes, such as homicide and damage to prop-
 erty.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution provides for the rights to privacy in the family, home, and personal cor-
 respondence. The law requires search warrants, but unlawful searches were report-
 edly common. Although the law allows electronic surveillance with a judicial order,
 it prohibits such surveillance in cases of electoral, civil, commercial, labor, or admin-
 istrative matters.
 On March 3, PRD Senator Layda Sansores uncovered what she asserted to be a
 government wiretapping operation in Campeche state. The Government denied in-
 volvement, and the PGR charged three persons found at the scene with illegal wire-
 tapping. The case was pending at year's end. Also in March, federal Deputy
 Santiago Creel, a PAN member, claimed to have discovered eavesdropping equip-
 ment in his Mexico City offices; the responsible parties were never found.
 g. Use of Excessive Force and Violations of Humanitarian Law in Internal Con-
 flicts.-There were numerous allegations of the use of excessive force and the viola-
 tion of humanitarian law. Incidents in Chiapas between the security forces and
 EZLN sympathizers and in Guerrero between the army and EPR and ERPI guerril-
 las led to many of these accusations. Several NGO's reported that the largest num-
 ber of disappearances were perpetrated by the army (see Section 1.b.).
 As a first step toward a comprehensive peace agreement, the Government and the
 EZLN signed the San Andres peace accords on February 16, 1996. However, since
 then the Government and the EZLN have remained divided on how to codify the
 accords. After criticism from President Zedillo, Bishop Samuel Ruiz, head of the Na-
 tional Intermediation Commission for Chiapas (CONAI), resigned in June, and the
 commission was dissolved (see Section 2.c.). Although the ELZN and the COCOPA
 congressional commission met in November, the peace talks remained stalemated.
 Since 1996 EZLN supporters have established 38 "autonomous municipalities" in
 Chiapas. The Government did not recognize these communities, considered them il-
 legal, and dismantled four. On April 10, the EZLN declared a new autonomous mu-
 nicipality, "Ricardo Flores Magon" in Taniperlas, Ocosingo municipality. The next
 day, state and federal security forces attacked it and arrested 12 foreigners and 16
 indigenous persons. The foreigners were expelled from the country. While some of
 the indigenous defendants posted bail, others stayed in prison (see Section 1.d.).
 On May 1, security forces entered a second autonomous municipality, "Tierra y
 Libertad," in Amparo Aguatinta, to free a Guatemalan refugee being held there.
 They arrested 61 persons and broke up the community. On June 3, 1,000 members
 of the police and military forces entered a third zone, Nicolas Ruiz, a PRD-controlled
 town that had declared independence, and arrested 167 persons. Security forces
 claimed that local PRI supporters had been expelled from the community.
 The fourth government operation occurred at the El Bosque municipal seat, on
 June 10. At the same time, security personnel entered the nearby towns of
 Chavajeval and Union Progreso to execute arrest warrants. The Chavajeval oper-
 ation led to the first clash between the army and the EZLN since 1994. In all three
 locations, a total of 8 EZLN partisans and 2 state police officers were killed, 9 others
 were wounded, and 53 were arrested.
 Internal conflict also led to clashes outside Chiapas. On the night of June 6, the
 army and the ERPI clashed in El Charco, Guerrero. Twelve persons, all guerrillas
 according to the Government, were killed. After investigating the incident, human
 rights NGO's found it suspicious that the military had sustained no casualties if,
 as the army asserted, there had been an intense firefight between troops and well-
 armed guerrillas. The authorities later released 20 of the persons arrested during
 the incident; they kept 2 persons in jail and subsequently arrested 2 more individ-
 uals. The Government insisted that those detained confessed to being guerrilla lead-
 ers, while the accused claimed that the confessions were false and extracted under
 torture (see Section 1.c.).
 On November 10, between 20 and 50 alleged EPR guerrillas attacked police posts
 in a small town in Guerrero. Two guerrillas and one police officer were killed.
 
 
 693
 On December 13, four masked men ambushed trucks carrying villagers, killing
 one child and wounding seven other villagers, in El Bosque. Eyewitnesses blamed
 the attack on the EZLN; the state attorney general was investigating the incident
 at year's end.
 Armed civilian groups, controlled by local political bosses loosely affiliated with
 the PRI, were alleged to have committed many human rights violations in Chiapas,
 including the Acteal massacre. NGO's, such as the PRODH, the Fray Bartolome de
 las Casas Human Rights Center in Chiapas, and the Mexican Commission for the
 Defense and Promotion of Human Rights (CMDPDH), identified at least nine such
 groups. The NGO's contended that these groups were not only the private armies
 of local bosses, but also army surrogates armed by the military and used to attack
 the EZLN. The Government denied these allegations and likewise rejected the exist-
 ence of "paramilitary" groups. The state government declared that it was investigat-
 ing the NGO's charges, and the PGR probe into the Acteal massacre included scru-
 tiny of armed civilian groups. Human rights NGO's and some press accounts explic-
 itly linked the Government to these groups, although they presented no hard evi-
 dence of federal government support.
 In December the Fray Bartolome de Las Casas center and the PGR published con-
 flicting reports on the Acteal massacre. The Fray Bartolome report blamed the Gov-
 ernment for sponsoring armed civilian groups in Chiapas and for failing to protect
 the victims. The NGO accused the Government of waging "low-intensity warfare" in
 Chiapas and stated that the Government was responsible for the massacre. The
 PGR attributed the massacre to a history of local confrontation, the presence of the
 EZLN, an absence of the rule of law, and the neglect of local enforcement officials.
 The military continues to deny any responsibility for abuses committed during the
 early stages of the Chiapas rebellion in 1994. The military authorities who have ju-
 risdiction failed to punish any military personnel or government officials for commit-
 ting abuses, although the CNDH issued an interim report in May 1994 finding that
 there was reason to believe that the military had injured or killed civilians in aerial
 attacks and that there were summary executions, illegal detentions, and instances
 of torture.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech
 and of the press, and the Government generally respected these rights in practice.
 The mass media are not subject to formal censorship by any element of government.
 In a complex communications industry environment, the media were more free
 and independent than at any time in the country's history. However, attacks on
 journalists continued. Many of these attacks are carried out by drug trafficking or-
 ganizations or by corrupt security personnel in the pay of such groups.
 Traditionally, the Government and the media enjoyed a cozy, mutually beneficial
 relationship that tilted coverage and editorial opinion in the Government's favor.
 While many aspects of that relationship have diminished significantly, they have
 not disappeared entirely. For example, the Government retains the power to grant
 or withdraw broadcast licenses, a power that media critics argued led some broad-
 cast media to practice self-censorship. Accordingly, old habits of accommodation lin-
 gered, and the editorial line of key news organizations maintained a bias in favor
 of the Government. The persistence of official influence-and its greatest concentra-
 tion-was most apparent in television. Instead of paying a 12.5 percent tax on ad-
 vertising revenues, television broadcasters provided free broadcast time to the Gov-
 ernment, which gave it convenient access to this powerful medium. Official advertis-
 ing in the media continues, but disguising it as news coverage is more common at
 the state than at the national level. The Government was in the process of
 privatizing the state-run newsprint sales company at year's end, and it no longer
 has a monopoly on the import of newsprint. Cash and noncash payments to journal-
 ists persist but are not as common as they once were, and legislation to end this
 practice has been enacted.
 Television was especially affected by greater political pluralism, generational
 change in media leadership, and growing competition for advertisers and viewers,
 which continued to separate government and media interests. Moreover, as much
 of the national media developed higher journalistic standards and greater independ-
 ence over the past 10 years, government influence declined. The media showed a
 high degree of editorial independence, particularly in the capital and other major
 uban centers. Direct criticism of the Government, especially in the press, was se-
 vere and commonplace.
 The many credible reports of attacks on journalists constituted the most serious
 problem for press freedom. Such attacks have increased since 1997, although fatal
 assaults were well below that year's level. From January to August, the CNDH re-
 
 
 694
 corded 32 complaints of attacks on journalists. The Manuel Buendia foundation re-
 corded 57 attacks during the same period. Despite the disagreement on numbers,
 both institutions agreed that the vast majority of attacks were intended to intimi-
 date. An NGO report alleged that federal, state, or local police were responsible in
 35 percent of the attacks. Drug trafficking organizations or corrupt security forces
 personnel in the pay of such groups appeared to be behind some incidents.
 Homero Aridjis, a Mexican citizen who is president of PEN International, reported
 that he received numerous telephone death threats. The Government provided him
 with bodyguards.
 Local officials harassed national and international journalists. The Committee to
 Protect Journalists documented several such instances in Chiapas and Guerrero. In
 most cases, local police officials stopped and menaced the Mexican employees of
 international wire services trying to cover armed conflicts in those states. In April
 local police at the airport in Tuxtla Gutierrez, Chiapas, struck foreign photog-
 raphers and tried to confiscate their film at the urging of federal immigration offi-
 cials. The CNDH investigated the report, determined that the authorities acted im-
 properly, and on May 15 recommended to the governor of Chiapas and the Commis-
 sioner of the National Immigration Institute that corrective action be taken; no ac-
 tion had been taken at year's end.
 The CNDH and the Manuel Buendia foundation reported only one case of a jour-
 nalist murdered as a result of his work. In February Luis Mario Garcia Rodriguez,
 a reporter for the Mexico City daily newspaper La Tarde, was shot and killed very
 close to a Mexico City police station. Witnesses stated that the perpetrators were
 from the PGR. Garcia had reported on PGR corruption and charged that PGR offi-
 cials were collaborating with notorious drug traffickers. His murder remained under
 PGJDF investigation at year's end.
 In early March, foreign journalists complained about difficulties they were having
 in obtaining visas, and the Government resolved these cases. Officials strongly and
 publicly denied that new regulations governing foreign correspondents had been in-
 stituted. In June a foreign reporter complained that he could not obtain a visa to
 go to Mexico City to report on events there. Since then, no further reports of foreign
 journalists having trouble obtaining visas emerged.
 The Constitution recognizes academic freedom in higher education, and the Gov-
 ernment respected this provision in practice.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 the right of assembly, and the Government respects this right in practice. The only
 requirement for holding a demonstration is that groups wishing to meet in public
 areas inform local police in advance. Large peaceful antigovernment, public dem-
 onstrations were held regularly in Mexico City and throughout the country without
 police interference. Police infrequently used force to disperse protesters (see Sections
 l.a. and l.c.).
 The Constitution provides for the right to organize or affiliate with political par-
 ties, and the Government respects this right in practice. Opposition and independ-
 ent associations functioned freely without government interference or restriction.
 The Federal Electoral Code recognizes national political associations, which may
 participate in elections through an agreement with one political party but are not
 allowed to use their names or symbols during election campaigns. Political parties
 do not have legal status until officially recognized by the Federal Electoral Institute
 (IFE).
 Citizens are free to associate and may form private or charitable associations. In
 November the Mexico City legislature passed a new law on charities that gave the
 city government more influence over private charities. Many charitable groups criti-
 cized the new law. NGO's are an important and vocal part of civil society. According
 to the NGO council of Mexico City, the number of NGO's has grown from 5,076 in
 1995 to over 8,000.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for the right to practice the re-
 ligion of one's choice, and the authorities generally respect this right in practice.
 However, local officials sometimes infringed on this right. In November the Govern-
 ment and representatives of many religious denominations signed a Religious Code
 of Conduct that reaffirms freedom of religion. The law bars clergy from holding pub-
 lic office and from advocating partisan political views. The federal Office of Religious
 Affairs actively promotes religious tolerance.
 The Government lifted almost all restrictions on the Catholic Church in 1992. The
 Catholic Church maintains its own schools. Nonetheless, the Church's ability to own
 and operate mass media is limited, and it asserts that there are restrictions on the
 running of schools and the raising and spending of funds.
 Relations were difficult between -the Catholic diocese of San Cristobal de las
 Casas, Chiapas, and the Government. The Government blamed Samuel Ruiz, the
 
 
 695
 Bishop of the diocese, for exacerbating its problems with the EZLN and the inter-
 national human rights community (see Section 1.g.). The diocese complained that
 its lay catechists constantly were threatened and harassed, and that foreign clergy
 working for the diocese could not have their visa status clarified. In February the
 Government expelled French Catholic priest Michel Chanteau, who had been the
 parish priest of Chenalho, Chiapas, for 32 years, on immigration grounds. Chanteau
 had blamed the Government publicly for the Acteal massacre.
 The non-Catholic Christian population was growing in Campeche, Chiapas, Yuca-
 tan, and the northern border. The Evangelical Commission in Defense of Human
 Rights claimed that the authorities had expelled 30,000 evangelicals from San Juan
 Chamula, Chiapas, in the last 30 years. Municipal authorities expelled 70 evan-
 gelical Christians living in San Juan Chamula on July 26, but state officials helped
 them return on August 1. Societal harassment of, and pressures against, evangelical
 Christians continued to be a problem (see Section 5).
 On December 1, the authorities withdrew an expulsion order for five foreign cler-
 gymen who had strayed near rebel territory.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Constitution provides for the right of free movement, and the Gov-
 ernment generally does not restrict movement of citizens into, out of, or within the
 country.
 The army and federal immigration authorities maintain strict checkpoints in
 parts of Chiapas. The focus of the checkpoints is the verification of tourist activities
 by persons with tourist visas. Church and human rights activists claim that the
 'Government is fostering an antiforeigner climate.
 Illegal immigrants were sometimes the victims of corrupt polce. For example, 45
 Guatemalans heading north were beaten and robbed by federal police on July22
 before being turned over to immigration authorities. This case notwithstanding, ille-
 gal immigrants rarely filed charges when crimes were committed against them. The
 authorities generally immediately deport illegal immigrants who come to their at-
 tention; therefore, a pending case brought by an illegal immigrant is subject to dis-
 missal once the immigrant has been deported.
 The law protects foreigners who face political persecution. The Government ac-
 cepts the principle of first asylum and reviews each claim to asylum on a case-by-
 case basis with assistance from the office of the United Nations High Commissioner
 for Refugees (UNHCR). It usually cooperates with the UNHCR and other humani-
 tarian organizations in assisting refugees. A possible exception to that rule occurred
 in July when a ship bound for Tampico, Tamaulipas picked up 10 Cubans on a raft.
 Immigration authorities and a Cuban consul, but not the UNHCR, interviewed the
 Cubans. The authorities maintained that none of the 10 persons established a well-
 founded fear of persecution and deported them to Cuba.
 More typical of the Government's refugee policy was its cooperation with the
 UNHCR in the repatriation or resettlement of Guatemalan refugees, most located
 in Chiapas (15,029), Campeche (7,845), and Quintana Roo (2,620). As of July 31,
 38,947 refugees had been repatriated to Guatemala. Approximately 4,000 more refu-
 gees are to be repatriated voluntarily before the program ends in 1999. The refugees
 remaining in Mexico were being offered legal permanent residence.
 Between January and October, the authorities expelled 39,334 Guatemalans,
 24,675 Hondurans, 22,201 Salvadorans, and 1,642 Nicaraguans. Many of those ex-
 Fe led were en route to the country's northern border. There were no reports of the
 rced return of persons to a country where they clearly feared persecution; how-
 ever, UNHCR officials were not provided the opportunity to interview the 10 Cu-
 bans picked up in July.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The Constitution provides citizens with the right to change their government
 peacefully through periodic elections. Since the party's founding in 1929, the PRI
 has dominated politics, controlled the Federal Government, and won every presi-
 dential election. The PRI has maintained power, in part, through public patronage,
 use of government and party resources, and election fraud. However, political
 change continued to alter the nation's politics, and opposition parties continued to
 gain strength nationally and locally. Electoral reforms approved in 1996 and imple-
 mented in 1997 markeda    ansition from the traditional political system.
 Presidents are elected every 6 years and cannot be reelected. In the 1997 elections
 the PRI lost its absolute majority in the lower house for the first time, and the oppo-
 sition PHD and PAN made strong gains. The PRI holds 238 seats in the Chamber
 of Deputies; the PRD holds 126; the PAN holds 120; the Greens (PVEM) and the
 Workers Party (PT) each hold 7; and there are 2 independents. The PRI holds 77
 
 
 seats in the Senate; the PAN holds 31; the PRD holds 16; the PVEM holds 2; the
 PT hold 1; and there are 2 independents.
 On the municipal level, opposition strength is well-established. The PAN controls
 12 of the 20 largest municipalities, and the PRD governs the largest urban center,
 Mexico City. In the year's 14 statewide elections, the PAN won the governorship of
 Aguascalientes, PRD candidate Ricardo Monreal was elected governor of Zacatecas,
 and a coalition headed by the, PRD won the governor's race in Tlaxcala. The PRI
 won the gubernatorial contests in Durango, Veracruz, Oaxaca, Tamaulipas, Sinaloa,
 and Puebla, and demonstrated that it could compete successfully in a changing,
 more open political process. The party's first-ever open primary in Chihuahua re-
 sulted in the selection of a candidate who won back the governorship for the PRI.
 The PRI also won state elections in Yucatan and municipal elections in Michoacan
 and Chiapas.
 Elections were generally free and fair. Postelection disputes or complaints by los-
 ing candidates declined significantly. However, in four states there were varying de-
 grees of electoral disputes. In Yucatan, the PHI majority in the legislature initially
 refused to seat a PHD deputy. Although both the IFE and the Federal Electoral Tri-
 bunal ruled in the PRD's favor, the PHI refused to yield. The PRI finally gave in
 after the PHD's national leadership threatened to end all negotiations with the
 Zedillo administration on domestic policy. The P1W contested the PRI's legislative
 and gubernatorial victories in Oaxaca, but since it could not present solid evidence
 of fraud, the state election institute ratified the results. The same pattern occurred
 in Tamaulipas where the PAN complained about the PRI's victory. The opposition
 also complained that the elections in Chiapas could not be considered valid in view
 of the security situation and the difficult conditions caused by natural disasters.
 Massive public demonstrations and the threat of impeachment helped drive
 Morelos governor Carrillo Olea from his post on May 18 (see Section l.a.).
 The Federal Electoral Institute, operating with full autonomy, organized the fed-
 eral elections for the Congress and in 1997 for the mayor of Mexico City. (In subse-
 quent elections, Mexico City is to have its own electoral commission.) The IFE has
 implemented extensive constitutional and legislative reforms passed in 1996 to help
 prevent electoral fraud and to "level the playing field" for the political parties by
 regulating campaign finance, advertising, and other measures. The IFE also has
 provided support to state electoral institutes in running state and local elections and
 was instrumental in overhauling electoral district boundaries to reflect demographic
 shifts.
 Women and indigenous people are underrepresented in government and politics.
 However, the three largest political parties are attempting to increase the number
 of women who run for elected office through formal and informal means. They have
 utilized quotas requiring that a certain percentage of candidates on a p arty list he
 female, and in practice have supported female candidates over- equally qualified
 male candidates. The PRD has set a 30 percent quota for female candidates, and
 22 percent of its leadership is female. The PAN has used more informal methods,
 andl18 percent of its leadership is female. PHI party rules mandate that a certain
 number of spaces on the candidate lists be reserved for women, and 12 percent of
 the party leadership is female. The PHI is the only party to have had a female party
 president.
 Women held 17.4 percent of the seats in the Congress, a 3 percent increase from
 the previous legislature. Two women serve are teCabinet: Rosario Green, Secretary
 of Foreign Relations; and Julia Carabias, Secretary of the Environment, Natural he-
 sources, and Fisheries. There are no women governors.
 Constitutional changes in 1996 expanded the rights of indigenous people to elect
 representatives to national office according to traditional "usages and customs,"
 rather than standard electoral law. These traditional customs vary from village to
 village. In some villages, women have neither the right to vote nor to hold office.
 In others, they can vote but not hold office. Women were systematically excluded
 from the political process by traditional "usages and customs" in most of Oaxaca
 state and were expected to face soon the same phenomenon in the state of Qulntana
 hoo (see Section 5).   T
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 A wide variety of domestic human rights groups operate largely -without govern-
 ment restriction, investigating and publishing their findings on human rights cases.
 Government officials were generally cooperative, and, at times, responsive to NGO
 views. However, the Government used vigorous enforcement of its constitutional
 prohibition on foreigners engaging in political activities to hinder the activities of
 foreign human rights monitors.
 
 
 697
 After the December 1997 Acteal massacre, foreign interest in Chiapas increased
 significantly, and many foreigners traveled to Chiapas, often on tourist visas, to
 learn first-hand about conditions there. Human rights observer groups also made
 the journey, several on tourist visas, to observe the human rights situation and do-
 nate supplies. However, when individual foreign activists in Chiapas acted in ways
 that the Government considered political and inconsistent with their tourist status,
 the Government expelled them.
 On May 1, 134 Italian human rights observers and political activists arrived to
 deliver humanitarian supplies and visit Chiapas. After the Government denied them
 rmission to visit Taniperlas, the Italians proceeded into the area anyway. The
 vernment expelled 40 of them and announced that it would promulgate new im-
 migration requirements for foreign human rights observers. In December a court
 ruled that the Government had wrongly expelled 21 of the Italians, who had ap-
 pealed their deportation.
 On May 27, the National Immigration Institute proclaimed new rules that re-
 quired, among other things, a 30-day advance application, a 10-day limit on visits,
 a limit of 10 visitors per NGO, a detailed travel itinerary, and an agenda. Domestic
 and foreign human rights NGO's objected to these new visa requirements on several
 grounds: a 30-day advance application does not allow quick reaction to a changing
 situation; human rights observers should not be required to name persons to be vis-
 ited, since that practice may endanger them and limit the observers' ability to gath-
 er information; and 10 days may not be enough time for an investigation. Human
 Rights Watch argued that, taken together, the rules seemed designed to restrict
 human rights monitoring and give the Government the right to decide which human
 rights organizations were legitimate. The Government claimed that it took NGO ob-
 jections into account in designing the regulations and waived some requirements on
 a case-by-case basis.
 The Foreign Relations Secretariat has an NGO liaison office, and on May 8 it cre-
 ated a human rights office staffed by professional diplomats. The Congress interacts
 with NGO's through a citizen participation committee. In December the Government
 accepted the jurisdiction of the Inter-American Court of Human Rights. Acceptance
 was nonretroactive and excepted cases involving expulsions of foreigners from the
 country under Article 33 of the Constitution.
 NGO's continue to face many serious problems. For example, leaders and mem-
 bers of numerous human rights NGO's received death threats for criticizing the
 human rights situation. The problem became particularly acute in Chiapas where
 researchers Andres Aubrey, Mercedes Olivera, and Angelica Inda as well as Manuel
 Hidalgo, leader of the Bacosan neighborhood organization, received anonymous
 threats. From May 1997 through May 1998, the CNDH received 32 new death
 threat complaints, resolved 39 (a total that includes cases pending from previous
 years), and established a program to assist threatened activists in filing complaints
 and obtaining protection through the PGJDF.
 The Government established the CNDH in 1990 to address human rights abuses.
 Between May, 1997 and May 1998, the CNDH received 8,716 new cases, a slight in-
 crease from the previous year, and continued processing 1,376 cases carried from
 the previous year. By May it had concluded 8,706 of 10,092 pending cases. During
 the same period, the CNDH made 136 recommendations to the Government. Of
 these, the authorities fully complied with 27 and partially complied with 90. As a
 result of CNDH efforts, the authorities jailed 22 federal judicial police, 12 state judi-
 cial police, 6 military personnel, and sanctioned 287 public servants.
 However, some NGO's criticized the CNDH for lacking autonomy and enforcement
 authority, shortcomings the CNDH recognized and lobbied Congress to correct. A
 bill granting the CNDH autonomy was pending before Congress at year's end. Fur-
 thermore, NGO's contended that the CNDH was too large and bureaucratic and that
 the state commissions were ineffective. In December the Government's Interagency
 Commission on Human Rights announced a national program to promote and
 strengthen respect for human rights.
 General Jose Francisco Gallardo Rodriguez, whom the military jailed in 1993 on
 a range of charges, including embezzlement and dishonoring the military, continued
 to maintain that military authorities were persecuting him because he wrote an aca-
 demic dissertation calling for the establishment of a human rights ombudsman's of-
 fice in the military. Since 1996 the IACHR and Amnesty International had called
 for his immediate release. In March and April, General Gallardo was convicted on
 different charges in separate trials by two different military tribunals. Each court
 sentenced him to 14 years in prison. Following his sentencing, Amnesty Inter-
 national asserted that he had been imprisoned for what he wrote in his academic
 dissertation.
 
 
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution states that men and women are equal- before the law. It also pro-
 vides that education should sustain the ideals of "fraternity and equal rights of all
 human beings, avoiding privileges of race, sects, groups, sexes, or individuals."
 These provisions were not enforced effectively, although government and civil soci-
 ety made some progress in efforts to do so.
 Amnesty International reported that homosexual men and women were likely to
 be victims of abuse and violence. Police often tolerated and sometimes perpetrated
 such abuse. A number of homosexuals and male prostitutes have been killed in re-
 cent years. There was no progress in the investigation into the 1994 murder of gay
 activist Francisco Estrada Valle.
 Women.-The most pervasive violations of women's rights involved sexual and do-
 mestic violence, which is both widespread and vastly underreported. The penalty for
 rape is 8 to 14 years in prison. The law generally is enforced when the abuse is
 reported, but these incidents are underreported due in part to a lack of public con-
 fidence in the police. The CMDPDH maintained that a rape occurs once every 7
 minutes in Mexico City. Victims report only 17 percent of rapes, and the courts pe-
 nalize only 23 percent of the men eventually charged with rape. For example, a
 young woman told Mexico City police on May 3 that she had been beaten and raped
 by an acquaintance. Physical and forensic evidence supported her accusation. The
 police arrested and jailed the suspect 2 days later, but a judge released him on May
 12 based largely on the victim's prior relationship with the accused.
 Women are reluctant to report abuse or file charges,- and even when notified, the
 police are reluctant to intervene in what society considers to be a domestic matter.
 Police are also inexperienced in these cases and unfamiliar with appropriate inves-
 tigative technologies. According to press accounts, reports of domestic violence in
 Jalisco increased 86 percent in 1997. Press accounts also suggest that this increase
 is due in part to a greater willingness by women to report violence.
 Since 1993, according to Chihuahua state police, 178 women have been found
 murdered in the Ciudad Juarez area. The police report that 29 bodies were uniden-
 tifiable, 87 cases have been solved, and 62 murders remain under investigation.
 They classified 90 of the deaths as sex crimes and 40 as serial murders. According
 to press reports, more than 130 of these murders of have not been solved and there
 were at least 22 suspicious deaths of women by year's end. In January the authori-
 ties appointed a special prosecutor and hired foreign experts in serial killings to ad-
 vise investigators. Nonetheless, women's groups charged that the authorities ig-
 nored the murders because the victims were young and poor. In apparent support
 of that charge, the CNDH recommended in May that the state attorney general and
 the mayor of Ciudad Juarez be investigated for negligence. The CNDH also deter-
 mined that in its inadequate response to the murders the state attorney general's
 office had violated the human rights of the victims and their families.
 In December 1997, Congress passed a legislative reform initiative on intrafamily
 violence. This law had three main objectives: to discourage and punish intrafamily
 violence, establish protective measures for victims, and educate the public. The leg-
 islation expanded the crime of rape to include spousal rape, involving married or
 common law couples. The legislation has yet to be enforced. Past legislation has
 been interpreted loosely; in Jalisco the authorities only need to act on a complaint
 if the injuries of the victim take more than 2 weeks to heal.
 Under certain circumstances limited to statutory rape of a minor between the
 ages of 12 and 18, the Criminal Code provides that a judge may dismiss the charges
 if the persons involved voluntarily marry. In practice, this provision is invoked
 rarely.
 In Mexico City, during the first 8 months of 1997, the Center for Family Violence
 (CAVI) received 8,760 cases and assisted 11,732 persons. The CAVI provided coun-
 seling to 2,684 crime victims. During 1996, the Special Agency for Sexual Crimes
 received 5,643 complaints. Rape was the most reported sexual crime with 1,693 re-
 ported cases, 48.2 percent of the total; followed by sexual abuse, 1,053 cases; and
 attempted rape, 179 cases. The Center for Support for Victims of Sexual Crimes pro-
 vided counseling to 10,822 people in 1996, and in 1,611 cases it provided legal sup-
 port. The Mexico City Attorney General's office provided legal assistance to crime
 victims through a special unit (ADEVI) which was created in 1994. Between Janu-
 ary and August 1997, the ADEVI assisted 7,655 people and sent 1,592 cases to the
 appropriate authorities. The ADEVI also helped to obtain $210,583 for compensation
 to some of the victims.
 The IACHR reported a striking incidence of rape and sexual assault by state
 agents, particularly of women in detention (see Section 1.c.).
 
 
 699
 Over 1 million women each year, according to the CMDPDH, seek emergency
 mfedical treatment for injuries sustained because of domestic violence, the fourth
 highest cause of death for women. Groups such as the nongovernmental Center for
 Research and Care of Women are working to educate both men and women in an
 effort to counter the widespread view of domestic violence as a private act that is
 common and therefore tolerated, and to deter future violence.
 Although the Constitution provides for equality between the sexes, neither the au-
 thorities nor society in general respect this in practice. The legal treatment of wom-
 en's rights is uneven. Women have the right to own property in their own names
 and to file for separation and divorce. However, in some states a woman cannot
 bring suit to establish paternity, and thereby obtain child support, unless the child
 is a product of rape or cohabitation; the child resides with te father, or there is
 written proof of paternity.
 The Federal Criminal Code includes penalties for sexual harassment, but victims
 were reluctant to come forward and cases were difficult to prove. Sexual harassment
 in the workplace was considered widespread by NGO's and women's agencies.
 The Constitution and labor law provide that women have the same rights and ob-
 ligations as men, and "equal pay shall be given for equal work performed in equal
 jobs, hours of work, and conditions of efficiency." However, women typically were
 paid less and were more likely to work in lower paying occupations. According to
 an academic study, even though girls and boys attended school at similar rates, a
 woman on the average needs 4 more years of education to earn the same salary as
 a man in a comparable position.
 Labor law includes extensive maternity protection, including 6 weeks' leave before
 and after childbirth, and time off for breast feeding in adequate and hygienic sur-
 roundings provided by the employer. During pregnancy, the law requires employers
 to provide full pay with no dismissals, heavy or dangerous work, or exposure to toxic
 substances. To avoid these expensive requirements, some employers, including some
 in the in-bond export processing (maquila) industry, reportedly required pregnancy
 tests in preemployment physicals or exposed pregnant women to difficult or hazard-
 ous conditions to make them quit. The U.S. National Administrative Office (NAO),
 under terms of the North American Agreement on Labor Cooperation (NAALC), the
 labor side agreement to the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), ac-
 cepted a challenge to these practices in the maquila industry. On January 12, the
 NAO recommended ministerial consultations. As a result, the U.S. and Mexican Sec-
 retaries of Labor agreed in October to hold a conference in March 1999 on gender
 discrimination in employment
 In order to protect women's labor rights, the Ministry of Labor made 23,138 safety
 and hygiene inspections in private factories and public institutions during 1996.
 However, while the Government increased the number of federal inspectors during
 1997 and negotiated agreements with an increasing number of state governments
 to expand and coordinate labor inspections better, the number of maquila plants far
 outstrips what state and federal inspectors can monitor.
 In 1995 the CNDH found that the largest number of complaints against health
 care institutions involved negligence or abuse during childbirth by medical person-
 nel and charges of forced sterilization. It said that the number of such complaints
 had grown, in large part due to women's increased awareness of their rights.
 The Constitution states that all persons have the right to make free, responsible,
 and informed decisions on the number of children they choose to have. The 1984
 General Health Law provides for criminal action against those who pressure a
 woman to undergo sterilization procedures or perform such procedures without a
 woman's consent. From May 1997 to May 1998, the CNDH received four complaints
 of forced contraception. There are 15 formal complaints under review by the Na-
 tional Medical Arbitration Commission (CONAMED), 10 for UD insertion without
 informed consent and 5 for sterilization without informed consent. Independent
 agencies believed that forced sterilizations exceed by several times the number of
 known cases, but the overall scope of the problem is difficult to quantify. Persons
 may not realize that procedures have been performed until after the fact, and many
 victims are reluctant to fie complaints. Further complicating the issue, some women
 may recant their consent if they must affirm it for investigators in the presence of
 their partners. Several NGO's and government agencies monitor government family
 planning practices. The CNDH has recommended that medical a   i     tors train
 their staffs to be more aware when dealing with such patients. The Government has
 instituted a number of mechanisms, including better training and medical review
 boards, to address the problem. In addition, the National Population Council, the
 institution responsible for population policy development, is working with
 CONAMED and the national and state human rights commissions to strengthen the
 channels for reporting these practices and to improve the resolution of such cases.

 In February 1997, the Government initiated an antipoverty program called PASE
 in five of nine targeted microregions, designed to try to break the cycle of poverty
 by tying together health, education, and nutrition benefits, with special emphasis
 on women and girls. In August 1997, the Government renamed the program
 Progresa and planned to have it active in all 9 microregions in 13 states, in order
 to reach as many as 500,000 of the country's poorest families by the end of that
 year.
 The National Women's Program (PRONAM) monitored the situation of women,
 made recommendations to the Government regarding women's issues, and worked
 with government agencies, international organizations, and NGO's to support wom-
 en's causes. PRONAM and the National Statistics Institute compiled gender-specific
 statistics to ascertain more accurately the status of women. The International Labor
 Organization (ILO), the Secretariats of Labor and Foreign Relations, and PRONAM
 also promoted the status of women in the workplace. In addition, PRONAM and the
 United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) initiated an advertising campaign at-
 tacking social stereotypes and discrimination against women.
 Children.-Over 40 percent of the population consists of children under the age
 of 18. The Government has committed itself to improving children's health and edu-
 cation but has not allocated sufficient resources to meet those goals. UNICEF has
 classified Mexico as "lacking adequate strategies" to combat malnutrition among
 children and reported that 30,000 children die each year as a result. Although 9
 years of education are compulsory, the director of the National Education Council
 reported in August that 1.7 million school-aged children were not in school because
 their poverty obligated them to work. On June 19, over 100 children visited the
 Jalisco state congress to protest the use of child labor in the streets after 9:00 p.m.
 The National System for the Integral Development of the Family asserted that more
 than 114,000 children worked on the streets of large cities. According to a study by
 the Congress's Employment and Social Welfare Protection Commission, at least 5
 million children are working in the country.
 At least 13,000 children lived on the streets, according to a UNICEF estimate,
 and these children were at high risk for drugs and exploitation. An Autonomous
 University of Guadalajara study estimated that there are over 1,500 children in the
 street in Guadalajara, a 50 percent increase in the last 10 years. Local NGO's main-
 tain that the total is higher.
 The Center for Research and Advanced Study in Social Anthropology counted
 5,000 minors, 90 percent of them female, working as prostitutes or subjects of por-
 nography. In Octber poice in Guadalajara broke up a child prostitution ring, they
 arrested 17 adults and 12 girls on various charges including corrupting minors and
 pandering. The case was pending at year's end. The arrests spurred press investiga-
 tions into juvenile crime, as well as meetings with city officials and local NGO's.
 Juvenile crime is an increasing problem; Jalisco reported a 400 percent increase
 in 1997. One-fourth of those arrested were under the age of 15. The director of the
 Center for the Observation of Juvenile Offenders claims that juveniles often are ar-
 rested for misdemeanors such as public drunkenness and vandalism. In Jalisco
 state, juveniles typically are remanded to the Family Council and then turned over
 to their families. The law specifies that the process take no more than 20 days, but
 some cases have taken up to 3 months. Children on the street often earn money
 by stealing, fencing stolen property, selling illegal drugs, or engaging in prostitution.
 While the Government and NGO's operated assistance programs for street chil-
 dren, corrupt police exacerbated the problem by pressuring children to commit petty
 crimes and extorting money from them. The CNDH attempted to protect childrens
 rights by educating children on their rights and reviewing legislation to ensure com-
 pliance with relevant international conventions.
 People With Disabilities.-Estimates of the number of disabled persons ranged
 from 2 to 10 million. On August 11, the President announced that disabled persons
 and their specific disability would be counted and listed separately in the 2000 cen-
 sus so that the Government can improve the services available to them. In Mexico
 City alone, 124 NGO's dealt with issues affecting the physically disabled.
 Twenty-seven states have laws protecting disabled persons. The law requires that
 public facilities be made accessible to disabled persons in Mexico City, but not else-
 where in the country. However, in practice most public buildings and facilities in
 Mexico City were not in compliance. The Federal District also mandated access for
 physically disabled children to all public and private schools. The Mexico City sec-
 retary of education, health, and social development maintained that 78 percent of
 these children received some schooling.
 Indigenous People.-For centuries, the indigenous people of the southernmost
 states have suffered discrimination, repression, and marginalization. Of the coun-
 try's 11 million indigenous people, 9 million live in extreme poverty. The 1994
 
 
</pre>
<pre>
 701
 Chiapas uprising focused attention on the demands of that state's indigenous people
 for protection of indigenous cultures, more jobs, and investment in schools, clinics,
 and infrastructure. The Governent, through the National Indigenous Institute and
 the CNDH, and various NGO's attempted to educate indigenous people about their
 political and human rights. The Government also professed respect for the desire
 of indigenous people to retain elements of their traditional culture. In the 1996 San
 Andrs accords, the Government agreed with the EZLN on the need to expand in-
 digenous rights. However, these accords have not yet been codified (see Section 1g.).
 In February the CNDH created a fourth visitr general to review and investigate
 violations of indigenous rights. In addition, more than 130 NGO's are dedicated to
 the promotion and protection of indigenous rights. Indigenous people in Chiapas and
 elsewhere throughout the country do not live on independently governed reserva-
 tions, although some indigenous communities exercise considerable local controL
 These communities apply traditional law to resolve disputes and maintain public
 order. However, as a result of long-standing patterns of economic and social develop-
 ment, indigenous people,particularly in the southern states, remain largely outside
 the countrys political an  economic mainstream. Consequently, their ability to par-
 ticipate in decisions affecting their lands, cultural traditions, and allocation of natu-
 ral resources is negligible.
 The law establishes some protection for the indigenous, and the Government pro-
 vides support to indigenous communities through social and economic assistance
 programs. However, these were not sufficient to meet the needs of all indigenous
 persons. The General Education Act states that "teaching shall be promoted in the
 national language (i.e., Spanish) without prejudice to the protection and promotion
 of indigenous languages." However, many indigenous persons speak only their na-
 tive languages. Non-Spanish speakers are frequently taen advantage of in commer-
 cial transactions involving bilingual middlemen, and have great difficulty finding
 employment in Spanish-speaking areas. Over 50 indigenous languages are spoken.
 Consistent with the indigenous rights law passed by the Qaxaca state legislature,
 412 out of 570 municipalities in Oaxaca elected their local officials on the basis of
 their traditional "usages and customs" rather than standard election regulations.
 Quintana Roo's state legislature passed a similar provision. While the laws allow
 communities in these states to elect officials according to their traditions, these us-
 ages and customs tend to exclude women from the political process (see Section 3).
 Religious Minorities.-In the highlands of Chiapas and other indigenous areas,
 traditional leaders sometimes acquiesced in, or actually ordered, the expulsions of
 Protestants belonging primarily to evangelical groups. In many cases the expulsions
 involved the burning of homes and crops, beatings, and, occasionally, killings.
 On August 27, indigenous Catholics in Mitzitn, Chiapas, took 23 evangelicals
 hostage and threatened to eject them from the community if they did not convert
 to Catholicism (also see Section 2.c.). A number of Catholic churches were burned
 in Chiapas, but the authorities made no arrests. While religious differences were
 often a prominent feature of such incidents in Chiapas, other factors such as ethnic
 differences, land disputes, and struggles over political power were more often at the
 root of the problem.
 Progovernment supporters have accused the Catholic Church in the three Chiapas
 dioceses of supporting the EZLN.
 The investigation into the November 1997 attack on a pickup truck carrying sup-
 porters of Catholic Bishop Samuel Ruiz on a pastoral visit in northern Chiapas was
 still pending at year's end, as was the case against the attacker of the Bishop's sis-
 ter.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution and the Federal Labor Law (LFT)
 provide workers with the right to form and join trade unions of their choice. About
 30 percent of the total work force is unionized, mostly in the formal sector, where
 about one-half the labor force is employed.
 No prior approval is needed to form unions, but they must register with the Fed-
 eral Labor Secretariat (STPS) or state labor boards (JLCA) to function legally. Reg-
 istration requirements are not onerous. However, the STPS or the JLCA occasion-
 ally withheld or delayed registration of unions hostile to government policies, influ-
 ential employers, or established unions. The STPS and the JLCA also registered
 unions that turned out to be run by extortionists or labor racketeers falsely claiming
 to represent workers. To remedy this, STPS officials require evidence that unions
 are genuine and representative before registering them.
 Lie the Federal Labor Board (JFCA), the JLCA are tripartite. Although trade
 union presence on the boards is usually a positive feature, it sometimes can lead
 to unfair partiality in representation disputes. For example, a board member from
 
 
 702
 an established union may work to dissuade a JLCA from recognizing a rival organi-
 zation. Trade union registration was the subject of followup activities pursuant to
 a 1995 agreement reached in ministerial consultations under the North American
 Agreement on Labor Cooperation (NAALC), the labor side agreement to the North
 American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).
 Unions form federations and confederations freely without government approval.
 Most unions belong to such bodies. They, too, must register to have legal status. The
 largest trade union central is the Confederation of Mexican Workers (CTM), tradi-
 -tionally a sector of the ruling PRI, but affiliation is by individual unions.
 The Federal Employee Union Federation (FSTSE), the Revolutionary Worker and
 Peasant Confederation (CROC), and most of the separate national unions, smaller
 confederations, and federations in the Labor Congress (CT) also are allied with the
 PRI, but several reviewed the matter of party affiliation. Other major unions, in-
 cluding the large teachers' union, are not allied with the PRI. The teachers' union
 severed its PRI ties several years ago, freeing its minority factions to cooperate
 openly with other parties, particularly the PRD. Rivalries within and between PRI-
 allied centrals are strong: There also are a few small labor federations and inde-
 pendent unions outside the CT that are not allied with the PRI. One is the small,
 left-of-center Authentic Labor Front (FAT). Most FAT members sympathize with the
 PRD, but the FAT is independent and not formally tied to the PRD. In November
 1997, 160 labor organizations representing workers in the private and public sec-
 tors, led by the telephone workers and social security workers unions, formed a
 labor central (National Union of Workers-UNT) in competition with the officially
 recognized CT.
 PRI-affiliated union officers traditionally have helped select, run as, and campaign
 for PRI candidates in federal and state elections and supported PRI government
 policies at crucial moments. This gave unions considerable influence on government
 policies but limited their freedom of action to defend member interests in other
 ways, particularly when this might harm the Government or the PRI. The CT, espe-
 cially the CTM, is well represented in the PRI senatorial and congressional delega-
 tions, although their numbers diminished somewhat after the 1997 elections.
 The ILO Committee of Experts (COE) has found that certain restrictions in the
 Federal Employee Labor Law, adopted at FSTSE request, violated ILO Convention
 87 on Freedom of Association, which Mexico ratified. These restrictions allow only
 one union per jurisdiction, forbid union members from quitting the union, and pro-
 hibit reelection of union officials. During the year, the COE and the ILO Committee
 on Application of Standards reiterated their criticism and asked the Government to
 amend the law. A 1996 Supreme Court decision invalidated similar restrictions in
 the laws of two states, but the decision applied only in the specific instances chal-
 lenged.
 The Constitution and the LFT provide for the right to strike. The law requires
 6 to 10 days' advance strike notice, followed by brief government mediation. If fed-
 eral or state authorities rule a strike "nonexistent" or "illicit," employees must re-
 main at work, return to work within 24 hours, or face dismissal. If they rule a strike
 legal, the company or unit must shut down completely, management officials may
 not enter the premises until the strike is over, and the company may not hire strik-
 er replacements. Provisions for maintaining essential services are not onerous. The
 law makes filing a strike notice an effective, commonly used threat that protects a
 failing company's assets from creditors and courts until an agreement is reached on
 severance pay. Although few strikes actually occur, informal stoppages are fairly
 common, but uncounted in statistics, and seldom last long enough to be recognized
 or ruled out of order. The law permits public sector strikes, but formal public sector
 strikes are rare. Informal ones are more frequent.
 During the first 11 months, the JFCA reported that 5,465 strike notices were filed
 and 33 legal strikes occurred in federal juiisdiction, 11.9 percent fewer notices and
 13.2 percent fewer strikes than in the same period in 1997. Federal labor authori-
 ties did not stretch legal requirements to rule strikes nonexistent or illicit, nor did
 they use delays to prevent damaging strikes or to force settlements. However, strik-
 ers at the Han Young maquiladora plant in Tijuana filed an "amparo" (a type of
 injunction) action in a Federal District court challenging a JLCA ruling in Tijuana
 that declared the strike begun on May 22 to be illegal. On August 17, the U.S. NAO
 received a submission from the U.S. flight attendants union alleging that the Gov-
 ermnent had violated constitutional and legal protections of the right to strike by
 intervening in a strike begun on May 31 by members of the Mexican flight attend-
 ants union against a Mexican air carrier.
 - On November 11, 300 dissidents from the National Teachers' Union used violence
 to force their way into the Senate. The dissidents held a number of Senators hostage
 
 
 703
 all night. The incident, although more violent than other recent incidents, was part
 of an ongoing struggle for control of the teachers' union.
 The Constitution and the LFT protect labor organizations from government inter-
 ference in their internal affairs, including strike decisions. However, this also can
 protect undemocratic or corrupt union leaders. The law permits closed shop and ex-
 clusion clauses, allowing union leaders to vet and veto new hires and to force the
 dismissal of anyone the union expels. Such clauses are common in collective bar-
 gaining agreements.
 Employer organizations have slowed efforts to push for labor law reform. In effect,
 government, employers, and unions had negotiated reforms through tripartite na-
 tional agreements and collective bargaining at the enterprise level. Reforms also
 were effected via cooperation in programs to increase, and compensate for, produc-
 tivity. Representatives of the Government, national labor unions, and employer or-
 g anizations met periodically throughout the year to discuss ways and means of
 bufiding a new labor culture of mutual respect and cooperation to boost productivity,
 wages, and competitiveness.
 Unions are free to affiliate with, and are olen active in, trade union internation-
 als.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The Constitution and the
 LFT strongly uphold the right to organize and bargain collectively. Interest by a few
 employees, or a union strike notice, compels an employer to recognize a union and
 negotiate or to ask the federal or state labor board to hold a union recognition elec-
 tion. LFT prounion provisions led some employers to seek out or create independent
 "white" or company unions as an alternative to mainstream national or local unions.
 Representation elections are traditionally open, not secret, although this seems to
 be changing. Traditionally, management and union officials are present with the
 presiding labor board official when workers openly declare their votes, one by one.
 Such open recounts are the prevailing practice but are not required by law or regu-
 lation. Secret ballots are held when all parties agree.
 Wage restraints no longer exist, except for those caused by recession or an em-
 ployers difficult situation. The Government and major employer and union organi-
 zations met occasionally to reaffirm the 1996 Alliance for Economic Growth and
 agreed on new tax breaks or minimum wage increases, but the Government kept
 its commitment to free collective bargaining without guidelines or government inter-
 ference. Wages in most union contracts appeared to keep pace with or ahead of in-
 flation, but most workers had not yet regained buying power lost over the past dec-
 ade.
 The country's record in internal union democracy and transparency is mixed.
 Some unions are democratic, but corruption and strong-arm tactics are common in
 others. There wee no further developments in the case of the factory committee
 leaders fired in 1996 for trying to improve conditions at a U.S.-owned maquila fac-
 tory in Sonora. The committee leaders had been fired with the complicity of an al-
 leged CTM "leader' who had a protection contractL
 A similar case in Tijuana, Baja California, resulted in a disputed 1997 election
 for the right to the collective bargaining contract for workers at a Korean-owned
 maquiladora. The parties reached a settiement, through the good offices of federal
 labor authorities, in January. That settlement provided for recognition that the
 FAT-affiliated union was the holder of the collective bargaining contract and that
 a newly formed, unaffiliated union be recognized by the JLCA. Shortly before a U.S.
 NAOpublic hearing on February 18, the submitters added allegations of violations
 of heath and safety regulations by plant management. Another new union entered
 the picture in the spring. As a result, another recount regarding the holding of the
 collective bargaining contract was held on May 29. On April 28, the U.S. NAO
 issued a report recommending ministerial consultations, and on August 11 issued
 a health and safety issues addendum, which again recommended ministerial con-
 sultations. On August 21, the JLCA declared the new union the winner.
 In another case involving freedom of association linked to the right to organize
 unions, in December 1997, 9 unions and 24 human rights NGO's jointly fied a sub-
 mission with the U.S. NAO alleging that a CTM-affliated union used strong-arm
 tactics to intimidate workers so that they would not vote in favor of a rival union
 to represent workers at a plant in La Paz, Mexico state. This submission also al-
 leged violations of health and safet regulations. The U.S. NAO accepted the sub-
 mission for review on February 4,held a public hearing on March 23, and issued
 a report on July 31 that recommended ministerial consultations. The Canadian
 NAO also received a submission on this case during the spring.
 The public sector is almost totally organized. Industrial areas are heavily orga-
 nized. Even states with little industry have transport and public employee unions,
 and rural peasant organizations are omnipresent. The law protects workers from
 
 
 704
 
 antiunion discrimination, but enforcement is uneven in the few states with low
 unionization.
 Unionization and wage levels in the in-bond export sector vary by area and so-
 phistication of the manufacturing process. Wages have been lower and job creation
 has beed greater in this sector than in more traditional manufacturing, but the gap
 continues to narrow and may now be minimal. Some observers allege poor working
 conditions, inadequate wages, and employer and government efforts to discourage
 unionization in this sector. There is no evidence that the Federal Government op-
 poses unionization of-the plants, which tend to be under state jurisdiction, but some
 state and local governments in the west are said to help employers discourage
 unions, especially independent ones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Constitution prohibits forced
 labor, which includes forced and bonded labor by children. There have been no credi-
 ble reports of forced labor for many years, with the exception of abuses of refugees
 and illegal immigrants in Chiapas (see Section 2.d.).
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment.-The law
 bans child labor, including forced or bonded labor (see Section 6.c.). The Constitution
 prohibits children under 12 years of age from working. The law sets the minimum
 legal work age at 14 years. Those between the ages of 14 and 15 may work only
 limited hours, with no night or hazardous work, which generally makes hiring them
 uneconomic. Enforcement was reasonably good at large and medium-sized compa-
 nies, especially in export industries and those under federal jurisdiction. Enforce-
 ment was inadequate at the many small companies and in agriculture. It was nearly
 absent in the informal sector, despite government efforts.
 The ILO reported that 18 percent of children 12 to 14 years of age work, often
 for parents or relatives. Most child labor is in the informal sector (including myriad
 underage street vendors), family-owned workshops, or agricultural and rural areas.
 Mexico City's central market employs approximately 2,000 minors between the ages
 of 7 and 18, who work as cart-pushers, kitchen help, and vendors. The children do
 not receive a fixed wage; most work long shifts, starting in the early morning hours.
 The CTM agricultural union's success in previous years in obtaining free transport
 for migrant seasonal' workers from southern states to fields in the north inadvert-
 ently led to a significant increase in child labor. The union and employers were un-
 able to convince indigenous farm workers to leave their families at home, and many
 have settled near work sites in the north. The union has had some limited success
 in negotiating with employers to finance bilingual education near work sites and in
 obtaining social security child care centers, but it has had difficulty in persuading
 member families not to bring their children into the fields. Many urban child work-
 ers are immigrants from rural areas, are illiterate, and have parents who are unem-
 ployed.
 The Federal Government increased the number of obligatory'school years from 6
 to 9 in 1992 and made parents legally liable for their children's attendance, as part
 of a reform to upgrade labor force skills and long-term efforts to continue increasing
 educational opportunities for and participation by youth.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The Constitution and the LFT provide for a
 daily minimum wage. The tripartite National Minimum Wage Commission (govern-
 ment, labor, and employers) usually sets minimum wage rates each December, effec-
 tive January 1, for the whole year, but any of the three parties can ask that the
 board reconvene during the year to consider a changed situation. The wage commis-
 sion adopted a 14'percent increase effective December 3, based in part on the Gov-
 ernmenfs projection of a 13 percent annual inflation rate for 1999. The Labor Con-
 gress, representing unions with the largest number of members, decided not to orga-
 nize public protests. During the course of the year, wage and benefit- adjustments
 to collective bargaining contracts averaged between 18 and 19 percent, which was
 very close to the final inflation rate for the year.
 In Acapulco, Mexico City and nearby industrial areas, southeast Veracruz state's
 refining and petrochemical zone, and most border areas, the minimum daily wage
 for the first 11 months was $3.10 (30.1 pesos). However, employers actually paid
 $3.53 (35.3 pesos) because of a supplemental 14 percent subsidy. These income sup-
 plements to the minimum wage, agreed to in annual tripartite pacts, cover all in-
 comes less than four times the minimum wage, decreasing as wages and benefits
 rise. In Guadalajara, Monterrey, and other advanced industrialized areas, the mini-
 mum daily wage (before the subsidy) was $2.86 (28.6 pesos). In other areas, it was
 $2.77 (27.7 pesos). There are higher minimums for some occupations, such as build-
 ing trades.
 The minimum wage does not provide a decent standard of living for a worker and
 family. Few workers (only 14 to 18 percent of those covered by social security) earn
 
 
 only the minimum wage. Industrial workers average three to four times the mini-
 mum wage, earning more at larger, more advanced, and prosperous enterprises.
 The law and contract arrangements provide workers with extensive additional
 benefits. Legally required benefits include free social security medical treatment and
 pensions, individual worker housing and retirement accounts, substantial Christmas
 bonuses, paid vacations, and profit-sharing. Employer costs for these benefits add
 from about 27 percent of payroll at marginal enterprises to over 100 percent at
 major firms with good union contracts. In addition, employers frequently subsidize
 the cost of meals, transportation, and day care for children, and pay bonuses for
 punctuality and productivity.
 The LFT sets 48 hours as the legal workweek, with pay for 56 hours. Workers
 asked to exceed 3 hours of overtime per day or required to work overtime on 3 con-
 secutive days must be paid triple the normal wage. For most industrial workers, es-
 pecially under union contract, the true workweek is 42 hours, although they are
 paid for 7 full 8-hour days. This is one reason why unions jealously defend the legal
 ban on hourly wages.
 The law requires employers to observe occupational safety and health regulations,
 issued jointly by the STPS and the Social Security Institute (IMSS), and to pay con-
 tributions that vary according to their workplace safety and health experience rat-
 ings. LFT-mandated joint management and labor committees set standards and are
 responsible for workplace enforcement in plants and offices. These committees meet
 at least monthly to consider workplace needs and file copies of their minutes with
 federal labor inspectors. During the year, the STPS completed agreements with all
 of the state labor authorities and implemented new regulations on inspections,
 which provided for information exchanges and federal training of state inspectors.
 Individual employees or unions also may complain directly to inspectors or safety
 and health officials. Workers may remove themselves from hazardous situations
 without jeopardizing their employment. Plaintiffs may bring complaints before the
 federal labor board at no cost to themselves. The Federal Government established
 11 special labor arbitration and conciliation boards (in Queretaro, Pachuca, Ciudad
 del Carmen, Zacatecas, Orizaba, Ciudad Juarez, Cancun, Colima, La Paz, Reynosa,
 and Tijuana) in 1997 and four more state offices of the STPS in 1998 to make it
 more convenient for workers to file complaints and bring other actions before the
 labor court system. In addition, the Labor Secretary transferred more personnel to
 the JFCA to reduce backlogs. He also highlighted as special issues child labor,
 women in the workplace, and the physically disabled by assigning responsibility for
 them directly to one of the under secretaries.
 STPS and IMSS officials report that compliance is reasonably good at most large
 companies. Federal inspectors are stretched too thin for effective enforcement if
 companies do not comply voluntarily and fulfill their legal obligation to train work-
 ers in occupational health and safety matters. There are special problems in con-
 struction, where unskilled, untrained, poorly educated, transient labor is common,
 especially at many small sites and companies. Many unions, particularly in con-
 struction, are not organized effectively to provide training, to encourage members
 to work safely and healthily, to participate in the joint committees, or to insist on
 their rights.
