 LIBYA
 The Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya describes its
 form of government as "popular democracy". The governing
 principles of the society are expressed in Colonel Mu'ammar
 al-Qadhafi's  "third universal theory" -- the Green Book --
 rather than in a constitution. These have created a govern-
 ment which conceives of itself as being based heavily on
 Islamic teachings and which places a great deal of emphasis
 on full participation of the people in the decisions which
 affect their daily lives. This participation comes through
 a system of people's committees which operate not only local
 governments but virtually every local enterprise, ranging
 from farming and manufacturing to the educational and social
 infrastructure of the country.
 The U.S. Embassy in Tripoli was attacked by a mob on December 2;
 thereafter, the staff was drastically reduced and normal Embassy
 operations temporarily were suspended.
 1.   Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 Although allegations of torture are infrequent in Libya, there
 are reports that isolated incidents of torture may occur during
 some security investigations. The Department of State has no
 evidence to confirm these reports.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 Detainees in criminal and security cases reportedly are
 frequently beaten during interrogation. While such treatment
 is proscribed by law, it appears to be condoned by government
 officials. Reports of cruel treatment of convicted prisoners
 are rare. The execution in 1977 of prisoners charged with
 plotting the overthrow of the regime was described by Amnesty
 International as "the first in the country for 25 years." Some
 of the penalties imposed by Islamic law, such as the severance
 of hands for theft and the stoning of adulterers, have not been
 carried out, even though officially the Koran is "the law of the
 society." Prison conditions are tolerable, with regular visits
 by relatives permitted, sufficient food available and forced
 labor not required. Juvenile offenders are referred to re-
 habilitation centers. The International Committee of the Red
 Cross (ICRC) does not maintain a representative in Tripoli and
 apparently has not sought to obtain access to detainees during
 the past year.
 c. Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 While Libya officially declared two years ago that "there are
 currently no political detainees on any charge in its prisons,"
 credible reports suggest that Libyan prisons contain prisoners
 convicted of political offenses. Amnesty International estimates
 the number to be 80. Some government officials have been exposed
 to milder forms of official displeasure, usually house arrest for
 a few weeks or months, after which they resume their duties.

 d. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Responding to charges by Amnesty International that individuals
 are not always provided access to legal counsel, the Libyan
 authorities claimed in 1977 that they "guarantee prisoners
 all necessary means of defense and safeguards of justice
 adequate to the principles contained in the declaration of
 human rights." They also allow the accused to contact their
 lawyers and families as soon as possible with respect to the
 exigencies of interrogation." In security cases, however,
 access to legal counsel is delayed. Apart from the exceptionAl
 cases, virtually all trials accord with recognized legal
 procedures. Defendants are informed of the charges against
 them, lawyers are not hindered from examining all evidence
 presented, and trials are conducted in public. Diplomatic
 observers are allowed to attend trials of non-Libyan citizens.
 The judiciary is tnsulated from control by the security
 apparatus, and has dismissed some cases brought to court by
 the security authorities.
 e.   Invasion of the Home
 Residences usually are entered only after extensive surveillance
 by the authorities. The legal stipulation that warrants must
 first be obtained is often disregarded.
 2.   Government Policies Relating to the Fulfillment of
 Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care and
 Education:
 The government has made substantial efforts to fulfill vital
 human needs. The transition to a socialist economic system is
 in its final stages, and has resulted in the reduction of
 disparities among social classes. Food staples are sub-
 sidized by the government, and expensive agricultural projects
 funded by petrodollars reflect Libya's desire to achieve
 agricultural self-sufficiency. Education is provided at no
 cost to all Libyan youth, including thousands of university
 students studying at American and European colleges. Medical
 clinics, staffed by Libyan and foreign medical personnel, have
 been established throughout the country and dispense basic
 medical care at minimal cost. Col. Qadhafi has responded to
 complaints about the housing shortage by decreeing that an
 individual may own only one residence. That decree stimulated
 a disorderly wave of housing repossessions that has left the
 rental market'chaotic. Corruption, while pervasive, has not
 significantly affected the government's performance in providing
 vital needs.
 3.   Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 Col. Qadhafi's government has restricted basic democratic
 freedoms in Libya. Libyans are circumspect about uttering
 dissident views toward the regime's policies, although token
 criticism of the government is permitted during popular
 committee meetings and at the annual General People's Congress.
 The right of association is granted only to those institutions
 affiliated with the apparatus of the regime. The media are
 controlled rigorously, and newspapers do notprint editorials.

 Libya, which is overwhelmingly Muslim, allows a few Christian
 churches to operate.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel and Emigration
 Freedom of movement within the country is unrestricted for
 Libyan citizens, with the exception of security areas. An
 exit permit is required for travel abroad. Military con-
 scription regulations have led to some restrictions on the
 issuance of exit permits to potential inductees.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Libya describes itself as the world's only Jamahiriya, or
 "Republic of the Masses," and it does not fit readily into
 established political categories. Political parties have
 been outlawed, but a significant degree of political partici-
 pation in the system of popular committees and General People's
 Congresses is encouraged by the regime. These conunittees have
 considerable authority in the day-to-day running of the
 government though many major decisions are still made by the
 senior leadership. Special efforts have been made to recruit
 women and members of the Berber minority into this political
 structure. Trade and professional unions are integrated
 into the popular committees. Col. Qadhafi has urged workers
 to take over the business firms which employ them. Many have
 done so and the pattern now is for the workers to elect manage-
 ment--though in many cases the previously existing managers
 have simply been confirmed in their positions. Collective
 bargaining no longer occurs.
 4.   Government Attitude and Record Regarding International
 and Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights:
 Amnesty International sent a mission to Libya in October 1976
 to investigate human rights conditions. In August 1977, AI
 sent the report of its findings to Col. Qadhafi, drawing
 attention to inadequate legal safeguards, use of the death
 penalty, and alleged instances of torture. The Libyan Foreign
 Secretariat rejected these findings in a reply to AI in
 December of 1977. AI sent an additional letter to the Libyan
 Government in May, 1978 reiterating its concerns. As of
 July 1979, Al reported that it had received no reply to the
 1978 communication.
