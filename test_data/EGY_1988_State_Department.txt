 EGYPT
 Egypt is a republic in which the President and his party, the
 National Democratic Party (NDP), are the dominant political
 forces. The NDP, established by Anwar Sadat in 1978, commands
 large majorities in the two parliamentary bodies, the People's
 Assembly and the Shura (Consultative) Council. Three of the
 five legal opposition parties are represented in the
 Parliament. The Cabinet is headed by a Prime Minister
 appointed by and responsible to the President. Mohammed Hosni
 Mubarak was elected President by the People's Assembly in
 1981, following Anwar Sadat's assassination, and was reelected
 to a second 6-year term in 1987. His reelection was affirmed
 by a popular referendum. -
 Internal security is the responsibility of several different
 organizations. Of the three intelligence services, the General
 Directorate for State Security Investigations (GDSSI), which
 reports to the Interior Ministry, is the main agency
 responsible for domestic security, although there are several
 other police services, including the Central Security Forces
 which protects public buildings, facilities, and foreign
 missions. Investigations pertaining to national security may
 be undertaken by any of the three intelligence agencies,
 depending on the nature of the case. GDSSI conducts most
 undercover investigations of domestic opponents of the regime,
 and also carries out interrogations of suspects arrested under
 Egypt's state of emergency legislation.
 Egypt's economy has diversified over the past two decades, as
 industries such as petroleum and services such as tourism have
 grown in importance. An inefficient public sector dominates
 the economy, and the Government maintains an extensive network
 of subsidies and regulations as part of a social compact
 perceived by major segments of the population as essential to
 their economic security. Severe economic problems--sluggish
 growth, rising inflation, and shortages of foreign exchange--
 have led the Government to design a reform plan aimed at
 reducing the Government's large budget deficit and increasing
 the role of market forces. Implementation of this plan has
 been restrained, however, by deep-seated social and political
 resistance. The Government is cautiously trying to pursue its
 reform program while seeking to shield the minimal living
 standards of the poorer segments of the population.
 Egypt's human rights performance during 1988. reflected the
 Government's security concerns resulting from economic
 tensions as well as the continued existence of underground
 political groups committed to overthrowing the political
 system. The principal problems were continuing credible
 reports of torture of detainees, with a lack of visible
 effective efforts to investigate, try, and punish perpetrators
 of such abuses, and an emergency law that permits prolonged
 detentions without due process. The Government retained some
 restrictions on political activities and continued its use of
 emergency law authority--extended in March for the longest
 period yet, 3 years--to detain persons suspected of involvement
 in subversive activities. The number of political detainees
 decreased significantly from the 1987 level. The Government
 released most of the estimated 2,000 to 3,000 Islamic activists
 rounded up following a series of attempted assassinations in
 mid-1987. New arrests, including those in December of Islamic
 extremists in Ains.Shams district, brought the total number of
 political detainees at the end of the year to around 900. The
 Government closed down one opposition newspaper. However, it
 
 
 1312
 EGYPT
 demonstrated its commitment to protecting minority rights by,
 among other things, allowing a Coptic weekly to resume
 publication, providing police protection for churches and
 synagogues, and preventing Islamic extremist attacks on
 Christians and Christian-owned property. Additionally, while
 opposition political groups continued to complain of electoral
 fraud and Interior Ministry control over the counting of votes,
 a number of observers regarded the 1987 elections as the least
 flawed of any elections since the 1952 revolution, and it is
 generally agreed that political liberties have been extended
 during Mubarak's administration to the widest degree since the
 revolution.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There were no reports of government-instigated killings for
 political reasons or of political killings by underground
 groups. Thirty-three persons went on trial for their
 involvement with the "Survivors of Hell" Islamic radical
 organization which attempted in 1987 to assassinate two former
 Interior Ministers and a prominent establishment journalist.
 Another 20 persons were indicted for their role in the "Egypt's
 Revolution" organization, accused of killing two Israeli
 diplomats and attempting to kill a number of other Israeli and
 U.S. embassy personnel in a series of attacks in 1984-87.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no known disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Torture and other forms of mistreatment are forbidden by the
 Constitution and the law, but there are credible reports that
 they continue to be practiced by police and security
 officials, and punishment of such actions is very rare.
 Egyptian courts will not accept confessions or testimony
 considered to have been obtained under torture, and have
 ordered the release of defendants--including in 1988--in a
 number of different state security trials as the result of
 reports by forensic medical examiners stating that the
 defendants had been subjected to torture. Detainees and
 prisoners who claim to have been tortured can and do appeal
 for redress to the courts and public prosecutor. In a few
 instances, the courts have awarded compensation to torture
 victims. The law also provides for jail sentences ranging
 from 3 to 10 years for officials convicted of torture, and
 first degree murder charges may be brought against those who
 commit torture resulting in the victim's death. However,
 there were no instances in 1988 of security officials being
 tried and punished for such actions.
 In 1984 the public prosecutor initiated an investigation of
 torture incidents disclosed by the Supreme State Security
 Court in the Al-Jihad case which ended in 1983. Although the
 defendants were accused of assassinating President Sadat and
 planning an armed uprising, the court cited torture as a
 factor in its decision to acquit 190 of the 300 defendants and
 reduce prison terms for others.
 
 
 1313
 EGYPT
 In September 1986, the public prosecutor announced that torture
 charges against 40 GDSSI officers and 4 prison personnel would
 be referred to the Criminal Court. The prosecutor declared
 that, on the basis of 422 reports of torture of the Al-Jihad
 defendants, 28 torture charges would be brought against the
 accused security officials. After a series of legal wrangles
 in which the attorneys for the Al-Jihad plaintiffs challenged
 the impartiality of some of the judges hearing the case, the
 court finally issued its judgment in June. The Court found
 all of the security officials innocent of all charges of
 torture, and pressed charges against three opposition
 newspapers for attempting to influence the outcome of the case.
 The judgment stated that there was no doubt that torture had
 been used during the interrogation of the Al-Jihad organization
 members, but concluded that there was insufficient evidence to
 determine that the security officials on trial were the ones
 who had committed the torture.
 The Court's verdict raised concerns about the Government's
 willingness to pursue torture investigations vigorously.
 Indeed, Interior Minister Zaki Badr referred to the court's
 decision as full exoneration of the security services from all
 charges of committing torture. Partly as a result of this
 case, Amnesty International (AI) held a press conference on
 July 20 in which it "called on the Egyptian Government to take
 urgent and effective measures to protect detainees from
 torture and ill-treatment in prisons and detention centers."
 AI stated that evidence it had collected since 1981 indicated
 "a continuing pattern of torture of political detainees by
 Egyptian Security and other officials." AI's evidence
 reportedly iacluded firsthand interviews with torture victims
 and medical reports by Egyptian forensic examiners. Most of
 the alleged, victims were members of extremist Islamic groups,
 the so-called "Gamaat Islamiyya." AI cited Lazoghli and Doqqi
 State Security Intelligence complexes and Tora Prison as
 "torture centers." AI declared that it had gone public with
 its concerns about the practice of torture in Egypt following
 several years of efforts to engage the Government in a
 discussion of specific measures to ensure that torture does
 not occur. In January government officials, including the
 Interior and Justice Ministers and the Public Prosecutor, held
 discussions with the visiting Secretary General of AI, but the
 Government apparently has not responded to requests made at
 that time to take measures to prevent torture.
 Egyptian human rights activists concur with the allegations
 cited by AI, and note that most torture allegations involve
 members of the Islamic Gamaat, while other political detainees
 usually are not subjected to similar treatment.
 Various groups, including opposition members of the People's
 Assembly, the Arab Human Rights Organization, and the
 International Committee of the Red Cross, have sought and been
 denied access to prison facilities to inspect conditions and
 meet with prisoners. The Arab Human Rights Organization, in
 its 1988 annual report, stated that it has presented requests
 to the Government to improve prison conditions, including
 placing all prisons and prison officials under the supervision
 of the Justice Ministry, abolishing "special prisons" (i.e.
 detention facilities) established by order of the President,
 and removing all GDSSI officers from the prisons except for
 those officers ordered by the Public Prosecutor to be assigned
 there.

 EGYPT
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Two systems of criminal procedure are in effect: ordinary
 criminal procedures and the emergency law. Under ordinary
 procedures, arrests follow investigations, and arrested
 persons are charged with violations of specific laws. With
 the exception of certain applications of the emergency
 legislation, preventive detention is not practiced. Arrested
 persons have the right to a judicial determination of the
 legality of detention, and there is a system of bail. The
 ordinary law states that a detained suspect must be brought
 before a magistrate and formally charged within 48 hours of
 arrest or be released. By and large, there is careful
 observance of constitutional and legal safeguards in the
 arrest and pretrial custody stages. Arrests occur openly and
 with warrants, and the accused are brought before an
 independent judiciary.
 The major exceptions to the normal procedures arise when the
 emergency law, which gives the Government extraordinary
 powers, is applied. The Constitution and the emergency law
 empower the President, when national security or public order
 are thought to be in peril, to invoke emergency powers
 authorizing the arrest and detention of persons suspected of
 being dangerous to national security, irrespective of
 provisions of the penal code. Detainees must be charged for
 specific violations of the penal code if brought to trial, but
 may be held under the emergency law for interrogation without
 charge. Egyptian law specifies a wide range of offenses
 deemed harmful to national security which may be tried before
 a parallel system of State Security Courts under the emergency
 legislation. Despite a provision of the Constitution which
 states that a state of emergency may only be imposed in case
 of war, foreign invasion, civil strife, or natural disaster, a
 state of emergency has been imposed almost without interruption
 for the last 40 years, and continuously since the assassination
 of President Sadat in 1981. In March the ruling party majority
 in the People's Assembly approved a 3-year extension of the
 stateof emergency over the strenuous objections of the
 opposition parties. In the past, the state of emergency had
 been extended for 2-year periods.
 Under the emergency law, a person may be held without charge
 or due process while an investigation is conducted. Within 30
 days the detainee may petition the State Security Court to
 review his detention. The court has 15 days to review the
 case, following which it may order the detainee's release.
 The Interior Minister then has 15 days to offer objection to
 the court's decision, following which another State Security
 Court has a further 15 days to review the minister's objection.
 If the second court upholds the decision to release the
 detainee, the decision must be implemented. The Interior
 Minister, however, may simply order the detainee arrested
 again, in effect allowing the Government the right of
 indefinite detention of suspects in state security cases.
 The number of persons arrested under the emergency law in 1988
 was considerably less than in 1987, when several thousand
 members of the Islamic Gamaat and their sympathizers were
 arrested following a series of assassination attempts against
 public figures. During the People's Assembly debate over the
 extension of the emergency law, the Government argued that the
 law is applied only against "terrorists, drug pushers, and
 illegal currency traders." In fact, the emergency law was
 also applied to block the sale of property by some of the
 
 
 1315 ,
 
 EGYPT
 so-called Islamic investment companies, as well as to detain
 striking textile workers, pro-Palestinian student
 demonstrators, Islamic student activists, and relatives of
 suspects sought for questioning. The Egyptian Minister of
 Interior in November acknowledged 578 political arrests, plus
 an additional approximately 1,250 arrests for corruption,
 drugs, and common crimes under the emergency law. Incidents
 since that estimate was released have probably increased the
 number of political detainees by 200 to 300. In most cases,
 -detainees are released after interrogation and never brought
 to trial.
 Exile is forbidden by law. With regard to forced or compulsory
 labor, see Section 6.c.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The provisions in Egyptian law for public trial do not apply
 in state security cases. Persons accused of certain security-
 related offenses, which may trigger emergency law provisions
 at the Interior Ministry's discretion, are usually tried in
 public sessions in the State Security Courts. These courts
 have less independence than other courts because their
 decisions may be challenged by the executive. However, the
 State Security Courts have procedural safeguards (including
 the right of the defendant to be represented by an attorney,
 the attorney's access to the prosecutor's investigation, and a
 prohibition against secret testimony), and their judges are
 drawn from the ranks of the Senior Judiciary. The judgments
 of the State Security Courts may be appealed to the Court of
 Cassations (Supreme. Court).
 Under the emergency law, only the President may amend,
 commute, or cancel a sentence, or order a retrial. The law
 also grants the President the authority to approve or reject
 all rulings of the State Security Court system. In some
 cases, the President may order defendants in state security
 cases to be tried before military courts, although the
 applicability of this provision to civilian defendants is
 being challenged on constitutional grounds. The Egyptian Code
 of Criminal Procedures states that court hearings should be
 conducted publicly, but permits the court to order part or all
 of the hearing to be conducted in secret session or to
 restrict access to the court "in order to preserve public
 order or morals." The courts trying such state security
 trials as the "Survivors of Hell" or "Egypt's Revolution"
 cases have not ordered the hearings to be held in secret
 session, but have restricted access to the courtroom to those
 who have obtained special permits from the court.
 No reliable statistics exist on the number of political
 prisoners. Opponents of the regime are not arrested for
 criticizing government leaders or policies. The Interior
 Ministry has drawn a distinction between indoor opposition
 meetings, rallies, and discussions, which are tolerated, and
 public demonstrations, which are not. While many people may
 be detained for questioning under the emergency law, for the
 most part those tried and convicted for their political
 activities are members of groups advocating the violent
 overthrow of the regime.
 The High Judicial Council is empowered to override decisions
 by the Ministry of Justice regarding judicial appointments,
 promotions, and other personnel matters. The Council of
 State, a court system having jurisdiction over disputes
 
 
 1316
 EGYPT
 between private citizens and government agencies, is
 independent of the Justice Ministry and is effectively
 safeguarded against arbitrary dismissal of its members.
 In 1988 the courts continued to demonstrate their independence,
 taking decisions clearly at odds with the desires of the
 executive. In January the Supreme State Security Court in
 Giza ordered the release of four members of the Islamic Gamaat
 accused of setting fire to local video clubs after the court
 determined that their confessions had been extracted under
 torture. In July a State Security Court dismissed the charges
 against 14 defendants, members of the so-called Armed Nasserist
 Organization, accused of placing a bomb that exploded outside
 an Egyptian-American Bank in 1986 and of plotting to
 assassinate the Israeli Ambassador, and found one defendant
 guilty only on charges of illegally storing weapons. The
 Court ruled that the prosecution's evidence in the case was
 insufficient to convict the 14 defendants. A State Security
 Court also ordered the release on bail of three defendants in
 the "Egypt's Revolution" organization case, pending trial.
 (The trial began November I but was postponed again to January
 1989.) In May the Supreme Constitutional Court declared
 unconstitutional a law from the *9adat era requiring new
 political parties to accept Egypt's peace treaty with Israel.
 Two judicial institutions sometimes criticized by the
 opposition as superfluous and potentially dangerous to the
 judicial system are the Court of Ethics and its investigating
 agency, the Office of the Socialist Prosecutor. Created in
 1980, while Sadat was seeking to counter public criticism of
 widespread corruption in the Government, the court is charged
 with trying offenses against "Socialist values," i.e.,
 corruption and illegal business activities. The other tasks
 of the Office of the Socialist Prosecutor include approving
 candidates for elective positions in the trade union movement,
 professional syndicates, and local government councils, as
 well as performing security checks on appointees to senior
 government positions. The Socialist Prosecutor may impose
 travel bans on officials under investigation.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Constitution provides for freedom from arbitrary
 interference in private life by the State or by political
 organizations. Except when the emergency law is applied,
 police must obtain a warrant from the public prosecutor before
 undertaking arrests, searches, or seizures. On occasion the
 courts have dismissed cases when they determined warrants were
 issued without sufficient cause. Police officials who conduct
 searches without prbper warrants are subject to criminal
 penalties. The emergency law empowers the President, or the
 Interior Minister acting as his deputy, to authorize searches
 of persons or premises without following normal procedurs.
 The internal security services have the capability to monitor
 telephone and other private conversations of the political
 opposition and a broad range of citizens suspected of illegal
 or subversive activity. There are persistent and credible
 reports of routine screening of, and in some cases
 interference with, correspondence and especially international
 mail. As with search warrants, telephone taps and mail   ,
 screening normally require the prior authorization of the
 Public Prosecutor, but normal procedures do not prevail when
 the emergency law is invoked. The GDSSI and the other
 domestic intelligence agencies engage in surveillance of
 
 
 1317-
 
 EGYPT
 opposition politicians, political or social activists, foreign
 diplomats, and suspected subversives on a routine basis.
 Employees of most government facilities, public sector
 factories, and foreign embassies presume that their activities
 are monitored by government informants.
 Section 2 Respect For Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution provides for freedom of speech and of the
 press. Egyptians openly express their views on a variety of
 political and social issues, sometimes airing strong criticism
 of the Government. A lively debate of national issues and
 criticism~of government officials is evident in the media and
 in the theater. Much commentary reflecting differences of
 opinion appears regularly in the major government-owned
 dailies and magazines. Television, however, is more strictly
 controlled.
 The opposition papers are free to publish stories supporting
 the political inclinations of their sponsoring organizations,
 and their criticism of government policies is vigorous.
 Journalists ana other persons slandered or maligned in the
 press may sue in court or, in the case of journalists, raise
 the matter with the press syndicate.. By virtue of their
 positions, the President and members of the People's Assembly
 and the Shura Council may not sue for libel. There have been
 repeated moves to strip opposition members of Parliament of
 their parliamentary immunity so that they could be sued for
 articles appearing in their parties' newspapers.
 The Government occasionally exercises influence on the
 government-owned dailies and magazines, the editors-in-chief
 of which are appointed and can be dismissed by the NDP-
 dominated Shura Council. The Council.supervises the press to
 some extent through the Higher Press Council, a 45-member body
 chaired by the Speaker of the Shura Council and composed of
 senior press figures. One of the Higher Press Council's
 functions is to approve applications for new publications;
 some applications to publish independently owned journals have
 been rejected. The Council's approval, however, is only
 required for publications appearing regularly.
 There is no overt censorship, with the exception of bans
 occasionally imposed by the State Security Prosecutor on
 stories which might affect the course of investigations in
 State Security Court cases. Nevertheless, journalists and
 editors working for government-supported newspapers are
 sometimes given guidance by officials about the treatment of
 specific issues. This guidance is given informally to senior
 editors and board chairmen by senior officials, such as the
 Information Minister. This does not happen routinely; usually
 the editors know the policy and are aware of the limits which
 they are expected to observe. The Government does not give
 such guidance to the opposition press. Opposition press
 coverage of the arrests of Islamic extremists, strikes, and
 public demonstrations were not censored.
 In August the Government closed the Nasserist opposition
 newspaper Sawt Al-Arab following a controversial attack by the
 paper's editor on the Saudi ruling family. This was the first
 instance of government action to silence an opposition
 newspaper in recent years. The paper was the only opposition
 paper not published by an established political party, as
 
 
 1318
 EGYPT
 required by law. Thus, the Government did not need to use the
 emergency law, but simply revoked the permit issued by the
 Social Affairs Ministry to the paper's publishers, the "Friends
 of Arab Media Club." Many journalists regarded Sawt Al-Arab
 as a propaganda tool of Libya, widely presumed to be the source
 of the paper's financial support. Some journalists were
 concerned by the precedent posed by the Government's decision
 to silence an opposition newspaper. Supporters of the
 newspaper are appealing the Government's decision in the
 courts.
 The universities enjoy a considerable degree of academic
 freedom. Cairo University held the first annual conference of
 Egyptian political scientists in December 1987, and the papers
 presented included a number sharply critical of the Government.
 The faculty clubs at several universities, especially the
 universities of Alexandria and Assiut, held political
 discussions which led to friction with the Interior Minister,
 who publicly threatened to dissolve the clubs. No such action
 was taken, however. Faculty members are more likely to feel
 social pressure to conform than to experience any direct
 interference in their work.
 A wide variety of foreign reading matter in Arabic and other
 languages is available at newsstands and major hotels,
 although there are occasional reports of the seizure or
 censorship of foreign publications.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Under the emergency law, the Government can place limitations
 on the constitutionally guaranteed right of assembly.
 Permission is required from the Interior Ministry to hold
 public meetings, mass political rallies, and protest marches.
 In response to student demonstrations early in the year in
 support of the Palestinian uprising, during which students
 also began criticizing government economic policies, the
 Interior Minister developed a policy of permitting protest
 rallies inside campuses and by professional associations,
 particularly the activist Bar Association. Street
 demonstrations, however, were banned as a likely source of
 violent disturbances. Islamic organizations are permitted to
 organize public religious ceremonies, often attended by tens
 of thousands of people, on major holidays, but persons
 regarded as Islamic radicals may be denied permission to
 organize public assemblies.
 For a discussion of freedom of association as it applies to
 labor unions, see Section 6.c.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 According to the Constitution, Egypt is an Islamic State which
 provides for freedom of religious expression and equality
 before the law. Egypt has a tradition of religious tolerance,
 and, with some notable exceptions, the authorities generally
 uphold the rights of religious minorities. In accordance with
 Islamic law, only Islam, Christianity, and Judaism are fully
 recognized as religions with laws, traditions, and rites which
 must be respected. The overwhelming majority of Egyptians
 practice Sunni Islam or Coptic Christianity.
 Various Protestant denominations operate, some with
 significant Egyptian membership, others with a small, largely
 expatriate following. Members of recognized religions may
 
 
 1319
 EGYPT
 maintain links with coreligionists abroad. Christian
 missionaries who engage in proselytizing Muslim Egyptians may
 be prosecuted under article 98F of the penal code or under the
 broad terms of the law of national unity, even though
 missionary work is not specifically banned. This represents a
 departure from the traditional Islamic practice in which
 proselytizing Muslims would be considered a capital offense.
 Conversion from Islam, while not officially restricted or
 penalized, is discouraged by the Government, and even more so
 by social pressure. Marriages are held according to the
 religious traditions of the parties concerned and are then
 registered with civil authorities. Under Muslim law, a
 non-Muslim man wishing to marry a Muslim woman must first
 convert to Islam, although a Muslim man may marry a non-Muslim
 woman without either party changing religion.
 Coptic Orthodox Christians, the most significant religious
 minority, may constitute 10 percent of the population,
 although their numbers are a subject of controversy. The
 Government's official census for 1986 listed the total number
 of Christians at slightly over 2 million, but Coptic Church
 officals claim 7 million or more. Coptic-Muslim relations
 were generally good in 1988, and there were fewer incidents of
 sectarian violence than in 1987. Coptic Pope Shenouda has
 praised President Mubarak's efforts to promote national unity,
 and joint public appearances of the Pope and the Sheikh of
 Al-Azhar, Egypt's preeminent Islamic religious scholar,
 continue to take place to symbolize religious brotherhood.
 The case of 50 members of Egypt's tiny Baha'i community,
 pending since their arrest in 1985 on charges of violating a
 ban from the Nasser era on Baha'i religious gatherings, was
 resolved in 1988 when two courts of appeals exonerated the
 defendants of all charges. In 1987 a Cairo District Court had
 found 48 of the Baha'i defendants guilty under the law, saying
 Baha'ism was a "distortion" of religion. However, the appeals
 courts ruled that it is not for the courts to determine the
 validity of a religion, and that the Baha'i gatherings had
 been social in nature. None of the courts addressed the
 defense argument that Egypt, as a signatory to the
 International Covenant on Civi and Political Rights, was
 obliged to guarantee the free practice of religion to all its
 citizens.
 Other small religious groups continue to face difficulties.
 One group of free-thinking Muslims, including a former
 professor at Al-Azhar University, were arrested for promoting
 "heretical views" and challenging the validity of Sunni Muslim
 traditions. Another group of Shi'ite Muslims were arrested
 and interrogated for belonging to an underground organization.
 No charges were made against them, however.
 While most Egyptian Jews emigrated in the 50's and 60's, those
 who remain (fewer than 200) appear to practice their faith
 without restriction or harassment. However, the mass media
 frequently presents harshly stereotyped and even anti-Semitic
 caricatures of Jews. One popular television program this year
 represented the entire Egyptian Jewish community in the 1950's
 as saboteurs and agents of Israel.
 All recognized faiths can, in principle, establish places of
 worship, run schools, and train enough clergy to serve
 believers. Synagogues and churches are routinely provided
 police protection. Under a law dating back to the Ottoman
 era, however, non-Muslims must obtain a series of permits
 
 
 1320
 EGYPT
 culminating in a presidential decree to build or repair places
 of worship. Obtaining authorization can take years, and is
 often denied. Similarly, the Jewish community has had minor
 disagreements with the authorities concerning the preservation
 of manuscripts and compensation for cemetery land needed for
 public purposes.
 Egyptian law prohibits the use of places of worship to
 criticize the State. The courts have not yet ruled on a
 challenge to the constitutionality of this restriction.
 Although the Government maintains that sermons by Islamic and
 Coptic religious figures are not censored, Muslim prayer
 leaders are occasionally detained and questioned for delivering
 allegedly inflammatory sermons in their mosques. The Ministry
 of Religious Endowments also has substituted its prayer leaders
 for troublesome preachers at some mosques, and has taken over
 the administration of some privately run mosques considered to
 be centers of extremist antigovernment activity.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Egyptians are free to move within Egypt, except in well-
 defined military districts; there are additional restricted
 areas to which foreigners may not travel. Exceptions to
 freedom of foreign travel and emigration apply to males who
 have not completed compulsory military service, unmarried
 women under 21 or married women, who must obtain their
 father's or husband's permission to obtain a passport, and
 persons under investigation for criminal offenses or whose
 travel is banned by emergency law provisions. Citizens who
 leave the country have the right to return. Some who left for
 political reasons have returned since President Mubarak assumed
 office. There are no known cases of citizenship being revoked
 for political reasons. Under the state of emergency, the
 Prime Minister has authority, which he may delegate to the
 Interior Minister, to restrict foreign or domestic travel.
 The former Minister of Labor and head of the Trade Union
 Movement, who is under investigation for corruption, was
 barred from leaving the country briefly, but this restriction
 was later removed. The total number of persons denied the
 right to travel abroad is relatively small, and travel bans
 are generally applied according to normal legal procedures.
 Egypt's policy on granting political asylum has been liberal,
 and the extradition of those granted asylum is prohibited by
 law. Several thousand non-Egyptian arabs residing in Egypt,
 including many Libyan dissidents, hive been granted asylum.
 Egypt also allows the children of sdcde African refugees-
 awaiting resettlement to study in Egyptian schools, and grants
 residence to a number of elderly persons who have remained
 stateless since the Second World War.
 Human rights groups, however, expressed concern over two
 deportation cases in 1988. In August five Somali military
 cadets, who were members of tribal minorities, were repatriated
 against their will by Egyptian military authorities despite
 the attempted intervention of the Foreign Ministry. Three
 Iraqis, arrested on charges-of belonging to an underground
 Shi'ite organization, were also deported on orders of the
 Interior Ministry. The Iraqis are believed to have been
 executed upon their return, while the Somalis are in
 detention. The seriousness of the case of the Somalis is
 compounded by their having been accepted for processing as
 refugees by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees
 
 
 1321
 EGYPT
 (UNHCR). As a result of these two cases, the Government has
 revived a cabinet-level board on refugee matters to ensure
 proper coordination. Minister of State for Foreign Affairs
 Boutros Ghali also issued a statement reiterating Egypt's
 commitment to all international treaties and agreements
 concerning the treatment of refugees.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Despite a degree of political liberalization begun by Anwar
 Sadat and expanded under Hosni Mubarak, the right of Egyptian
 citizens to change their government through democratic
 processes remains limited. Since the 1952 Revolution, Egypt
 has had a~political system characterized by a strong
 presidency. Four former military officers (Naguib, Abdel
 Nasser, Sadat, and Mubarak) have served as President in that
 period, but civilian government has become increasingly
 separated from military influence. Nasser-ruled a one-party
 state, Sadat created an embryonic multiparty system, and
 Mubarak has substantially liberalized the political atmosphere
 by expanding the range of legal opposition activities.
 According to the Constitution, the President is elected by the
 People's Assembly; his election is then ratified by popular
 referendum. President Mubarak's election in 1981 following
 the assassination of Sadat and his reelection in 1987 for a
 second 6-year term followed these constitutional provisions.
 These procedures in principle provide a process by which the
 Egyptian people may exercise their right to change their
 government. The opposition argues that the Constitution
 should be amended to allow for direct popular election of the
 President. .Mubarak has countered that he is "administering
 democracy by doses," and that the public is not yet prepared
 for full democracy. In any case, the trend of current
 political developments is toward increasing political liberties
 and widening scope for legal opposition participation in the
 political system.
 The People's Assembly comprises 458 members, of whom 448 are
 elected and the remaining 10 appointed by the President. In
 the 1987 elections, the National Democratic Party (NDP),
 headed by President Mubarak, won 348 seats, plus the 10
 appointed seats. This represents a reduction from the 1984
 total of 391. The two principal opposition groups, the
 Socialist Labor Party (in alliance with the Muslim
 Brotherhood) and the New Wafd, won 65 and under 30 seats
 respectively. The Constitution reserves half of the elected
 seats for worker and farmer deputies. The Assembly debates
 and passes laws, and must approve the Government's general
 policies and civilian budget. The military budget is not
 subject to parliamentary review. Assembly members can call
 for parliamentary investigations and interpellate ministers.
 The NDP is a nonideological party which groups together a
 range of political camps, some of which support the statist
 and Arab nationalist policies promoted by former President
 Nasser, while others support the more liberal economic and
 pro-Western foreign policies promoted by Sadat. Still others
 are simply Mubarak supporters of little fixed ideology. It
 has a dominant role in most party-based institutions in the
 country. It holds a substantial majority in the Shura
 Council, as well as virtually all the seats in the 1,300 local
 popular councils across the country.

 EGYPT
 Five legal opposition parties are allowed to organize, hold
 rallies, publish their views, and run for election to the
 People's Assembly. The largest opposition party is the
 Socialist Labor Party, under whose umbrella the tiny Liberal
 Party and the illegal but tolerated Muslim Brotherhood (MB)
 ran in the 1987 parliamentary elections. This bloc, the
 "Islamic Alliance," captured 56 seats in the 1987 elections,
 making it the largest opposition grouping in the People's
 Assembly. The New Wafd Party, a revival of Egypt's leading
 nationalist party before the 1952 revolution, legally resumed
 activity in 1983 as the result of a court decision removing a
 ban on the political activities of the party's leaders. The
 New Wafd holds fewer than 30 seats out of the 448 elected
 seats in the People's Assembly.
 The Communist Party has been banned since the early 1950's.
 The National Progressive Unionist Grouping (NPUG), a legal
 bloc of leftist factions, includes some Marxists. The NPUG
 did not win any seats during the 1987 elections, and formally
 opposed the President's reelection. The fifth legal party is
 the tiny Ummah Party, a vaguely Islamic party with no
 substantial public following.
 According to a 1977 law governing the formation of parties,
 the Parties Committee in the Shura Council is empowered to
 review all petitions to establish new parties. The
 establishment of parties on religious or class lines is
 banned, which prevents the Muslim Brotherhood from standing
 for elections as a political party. Nonetheless, the Muslim
 Brotherhood participated in the 1984 elections as a partner
 with the Wafd, and in 1987 with the Socialist Labor Party.
 The ruling by the Constitutional Court striking down the
 requirement that all parties must accept Egypt's peace treaty
 with Israel may pave the way to the establishment of a legal
 Nasserist party as well. At this point, the only obstacle to
 the emergence of a Nasserist party is the requirement that all
 new parties must demonstrate that their platform is unique and
 constructive, but this provision is subject to interpretation.
 Many observers argue that the Government should allow all the
 political currents, including the Nasserists, the Communists,
 the Muslim Brotherhood, and perhaps even a Coptic party to
 form legal parties so that significant political forces will
 not be forced to go underground. The Government has responded
 that all major political forces are already represented in
 existing parties, so there is no need for new ones.
 The opposition parties continue to complain about electoral
 fraud by the NDP and the calculation of the election results
 by the Interior Ministry. The postelection ruling by the
 State Council Administrative Court that the NDP should give up
 17 seats to the New Wafd and the Islamic Alliance has never
 been implemented, and remains under discussion in both the
 State Council and Constitutional Court Systems. The opposition
 parties and some within the NDP and government leadership also
 object to the "party list system" used to calculate election
 results, arguing that direct election of individual candidates
 is fairer to smaller parties than is proportional
 representation, and would assure more high-quality candidates
 and popular participation. Some critics argue that the
 political system is designed to ensure that the NDP and the
 Government retain control of all important state institutions.
 Government supporters argue, however, that President Mubarak
 has firmly established at least an elementary multiparty
 system in order to create checks and balances and give
 expression to a broad range of political views.

 Women have full legal access to the political system, and many
 are active in politics and government. Twenty-one elected
 members of the People's Assembly and two presidentially
 appointed members of the Shura Council are women, as is the
 Minister for Social Affairs. The ambassadors to Rome and
 Vienna and 86 other members of the diplomatic corps arewomen.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government has not responded to most of the queries from
 AI and other international groups about human rights concerns.
 Al sent two delegations, including one headed by the
 organization's Secretary General, to discuss human rights
 issues with senior government officials in 1988.
 Human rights groups in Egypt continue actively to promote
 domestic and foreign human rights issues, even.though they
 have not been accorded official recognition by the Government.
 The Egyptian chapter of the Arab Organization for Human
 Rights, which has been active for several years, was denied
 permission by the Social Affairs Ministry to establish itself
 as a legally tecognized organization on the grounds that its
 activities were political in nature. The Government has also
 denied recognition to the larger Arab Organization for Human
 Rights, and refused permission for the establishment of a
 local chapter of AI. Nevertheless, the Arab Organization for
 Human Rights continues to maintain regional offices in Cairo,
 and publishes its newsletters and annual review of the human
 rights situation in the Arab world without interference.
 Within the Government, primary responsibility for international
 human rights matters rests with the Foreign Ministry's Legal
 Office and Office of International Organization Affairs.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Egyptian law provides for equality of the sexes, but aspects
 of the law and many traditional practices are discriminatory
 against women. Women vote and serve in the People's Assembly
 and Cabinet. On the other hand, a married woman must have her
 husband's permission to obtain a passport. A child must have
 his or her father's permission for travel abroad, even if the
 parents are divorced and the mother has custody.
 Marriage and personal status are primarily based on the
 religious law of the individual concerned, which for most
 Egyptians is Islamic law. The revised Family Status Law,
 enacted in 1985 to replace a 1979 law which had been declared
 unconstitutional by the Supreme Constitutional Court,
 amplified the legal basis for equality of the sexes beyond
 rights contained in Islamic law. It provides for a woman's
 right to divorce and preserves child custody and property
 rights. A second marriage by the husband (multiple marriage
 is acceptable practice in Islam) is grounds for divorce if it
 is shown that the marriage has caused the wife material
 psychological harm, or if the husband fails to declare such
 subsequent marriages. A wife has the option of retaining
 possession of the family residence or of receiving financial
 compensation. These aspects of the Family Status Law only
 apply to Muslims. Coptic Christians do not practice plural
 marriage, and the Coptic Church permits divorce only in
 unusual circumstances.
 
 
 1324
 EGYPT
 Under Islamic Law, which is applied in personal status
 matters, female heirs are entitled to one-half the amount
 received by male heirs. However, only male heirs have a duty
 to provide for all needy members of the family. Economic
 necessity as well as changing attitudes are drawing more and
 more women into the work force. They are increasingly well
 represented in medicine, law, and education. However, women
 employed in nonagricultural work are generally paid at about
 65 to 75 percent of the rate paid to men. In rural areas and
 within more traditional communities, prevailing cultural
 values make it more difficult for women to work outside the
 home.
 Despite the legal stipulation of equality, women living in
 more traditional areas occupy a subordinate and dependent role
 in the household. Women's rights advocates note that some
 traditional attitudes and practices--particularly female
 circumcision; Islamic legal attitudes toward divorce and
 plural marriage; and the male relative's responsibility to
 punish even to the point of death his female relatives who
 bring dishonor to the family by actual or presumed violation
 of the strict traditional code of sexual conduct--are highly
 discriminatory against women. Some of these actions are
 illegal. Most of these traditions are disappearing in the
 cities, but are still observed to varying degrees in the
 countryside.
 Coptic Christians work in all career fields, occupying many
 leadership positions in the business and professional
 communities. Copts continue to enjoy access to public
 employment, although there appears to be some discrimination
 against young Copts seeking to obtain employment in government
 or the public sector. Coptic representation at the highest
 levels of government increased slightly--from 2 to 3 of the
 total of 33 cabinet ministers and from 9 to 11 of 458 People's
 Assembly deputies--following the People's Assembly-elections
 and a minor cabinet reshuffle in 1987. Copts seldom- advance
 to the senior ranks of the military, security, or diplomatic
 services, nor are there any serving Coptic Governors or
 security directors of Governorates.
 Some Copts allege that they are discriminated against in
 admission to some fields of medical study, particularly
 obstetrics and gynecology. Islamic activists have objected to
 the prevalence of Copts in the medical and pharmacological
 professions, arguing that Muslim women should not be treated
 by Coptic doctors or go to Coptic pharmacists. There are also
 reports that universities have effectively blocked Coptic
 professors from becoming administrators and chairmen of
 certain departments.
 Although religious minorities face social prejudice and
 individual acts of discrimination from some Muslims, there is
 no evidence that these acts are officially inspired or
 condoned. President Mubarak has emphasized publicly the full
 equality of Copts and other religious minorities. The courts'
 application of Islamic law to personal status matters among
 Muslims and the Islamic influences elsewhere in the legal
 system have not affected the constitutionally guaranteed
 rights and freedoms of Copts and other minorities.

 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 The law provides for the workers' right to join local
 committees of workers, but does not permit strikes. About 20
 to 25 percent of the work force is unionized. Any
 establishment employing 50 or more workers must allow them the
 right to organize a local committee if the workers so desire.
 These locals are affiliated with national trade unions,
 organized along sectoral lines, all 23 of which are required.
 to affiliate with the single labor federation, the Egytian
 Trade Union Federation (ETUF). There have been complaints to
 the International Labor Organization (ILO) that requiring all
 national trade unions to join a single federation infringed
 upon the workers' freedom of association. Thus far, the
 Government has not given any indication that it will accept
 the establishment of more than one federation. The leadership
 of the Federation asserts that it actively promotes workers'
 interests and that there is no need for another federation.
 ETUF is a member of the Organization of African Trade Union
 Unity and is seeking readmission to the International
 Confederation of Arab Trade Unions (from which it was expelled
 in 1978). ETUF sends observer delegations to International
 Confederation of Free Trade Unions and World Federation of
 Trade Unions conferences, but, in an effort to maintain its
 nonaligned status, has not joined either one.
 Relations between ETUF and the Government improved following
 the retirement under government pressure of former ETUF head
 Saad Muhammad Ahmad in 1987. Ahmad is currently under
 investigation for alleged financial improprieties while he was
 jointly Minibter of Manpower and head of the Federation. The
 trade union movement held national elections in 1987, and
 elected a new ETUF Council and a new head, Chemical Workers
 Union President Ahmad Al-Amawy. Al-Amawy has developed good,
 cooperative relations with the Government, but has also been
 willing to insist on wage incfeases for workers to compensate
 for government economic reform policies resulting in price
 increases for many subsidized commodities. ETUF has accepted
 the 1986 government decision separating the position of
 Minister of Manpower from the position of head of the
 Federation.
 The trade union movement's elections are held periodically at
 all levels. ETUF has a pyramidal structure, with each level
 electing the leadership of the next level. A council of
 national union presidents elects the ETUF Council, which in
 turn elects the President of the Federation from among its
 ranks. Candidates for union elections are investigated and
 approved by the Office of the Socialist Prosecutor and GDSSI;
 those considered political radicals or with criminal records
 are weeded out in this process. The trade union movement is
 proud of the relative independence of its election procedures;
 a large number of union presidents were not reelected in
 1987. The person and property of union leaders are not
 threatened by the Government or nongovernmental antiunion
 forces.
 The Labor Law provides for a system of arbitration to resolve
 wage and working condition disputes. While the Labor Law and
 the Labor Unions law are silent on the right to strike, the
 larger body of Egyptian law in fact restricts workers' right
 to strike. The Criminal Code provides criminal penalties of
 
 
 1326
 EGYPT
 up to 2 years in jail for civil servants or public sector
 employees who strike. Somewhat more severe penalties may be
 applied to those who incite others to strike.
 The strongest antistrike provision is contained in the Law of
 National Unity, decreed by Sadat following the 1977 bread
 riots, which prohibits strikes that threaten the national
 economy. The full implications of this law are not yet
 clear. In 1987 the State Security Court ruled in the case of
 a 1986 train conductors' strike that the Government is
 obligated as a signatory to the International Covenant on
 Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights to allow workers the
 right to strike peacefully. However, a presidential review
 panel refused to accept the court's decision, and the issue
 remains unresolved. In August the organizers of a sitdown
 strike in textile factories in the industrial center of
 Al-Mahalla Al-Kubra were arrested under the same law, and at
 year's end were awaiting trial.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 The law provides for the workers' right to organize.
 Collective bargaining is permitted in the private sector
 (including in export processing zones), but not in the public
 sector where most union members are employed. For the most
 part, private sector wages and benefits are higher than those
 in the public sector.
 Trade union leaders note that there is a distinction between
 the unions' function in negotiating with the public sector and
 the private sector. Public sector wages and benefits are set
 by law at the national level. Trade unionists point to the
 constitutional provision that half the members of the People's
 Assembly must be workers and farmers, and note that the
 struggle to protect workers' interests in the public sector
 takes place in the legislature. ETUF also says that it holds
 regular private discussions with senior government officials,
 in which the Federation attempts to promote the interests of
 the workers. Working conditions are discussed between union
 representatives and management in public sector companies.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 The Constitution prohibits forced labor. There are no reports
 of forced or compulsory labor.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 The minimum age for employment is 12 (which is also the age at
 which a child completes compulsory education). The law
 permits children between the ages of 12 and 16 to work up to 6
 hours a day with 1 hour of rest, but prohibits them from
 working after 10 p.m. or engaging in certain forms of dangerous
 or heavy labor, such as mining. There is considerable
 evidence, however, that in practice underage children continue
 to perform full-time jobs, particularly in rural areas.
 Growing numbers of urban children also are working, as
 families are forced by economic necessity to increase their
 sources of income. Newspaper articles in both the
 progovernment and opposition press have charged that several
 million children may be working fulltime in violation of the
 labor law. Informal private sector workshops and cottage
 industries appear to be the main urban users of child labor.
 Representatives of both government and labor argue that such
 unregulated industries cannot be supervised. It is also the
 
 
 1327
 EGYPT
 case, however, that larger private textile factories employ
 large numbers of young girls, who may work up to 12-hour
 shifts. There is no evidence that any consistent attempt is
 made to enforce the law regarding child labor.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 Employers are required by law to provide acceptable terms and
 conditions of employment for their workers. The minimum wage
 of approximately $22 a month is low, but is part of a social
 contract which includes generous government subsidies of
 foodstuffs and other basic necessities. Within the local
 context, most workers are able to maintain a decent standard
 of living for themselves and their families. The regular
 workweek is fixed at 48 hours for factory workers. Many
 workers increase their incomes by working overtime.
 Employers are legally required to meet worker safety and
 health norms, which are modeled on the ILO's suggested
 standards. There are special provisions for women workers,
 including generous maternity leave. Employers who violate
 wage, hour, and safety and health provisions face civil and
 criminal penalties. Labor inspectors enforce these provisions
 with varying degrees of success. Employers are seldom
 prosecuted, but reliable sources confirm that the courts
 occasionally impose fines on offending companies. The worst
 violators of the legal provisions on conditions of labor are
 small workshop owners in the informal sector whose operations
 are not subject to supervision or inspection.
