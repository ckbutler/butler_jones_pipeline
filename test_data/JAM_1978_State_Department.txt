 JANAICA
 Jamaica is a constitutional parliamentary democracy.
 It has a two-party system, and the parties have al-
 ternated in power since the first elections in 1944.
 The present Government, heaaed by Prime Minister
 I, ichael hanley, was formed by the People's National
 Party (PNP), which won the parliamentary election
 ot 1972 and was reelected in 1976. The Government
 can choose its time for an election, but must hold
 one by 1981. Jamaica is a largely open society,
 ana Jamaicans have a high respect for human rights
 ana a vigorous press.
 The Jamaican legal system is rooted in English common
 law. The 3uaiciary is inaependent and competent.
 The Constitution provides tor an independent Director
 of Public Prosecutions to pursue criminal cases and
 tor inuepenoent cormissions to oversee or inquire
 into various sectors of public life.
 Under Prime minister hanley's leadership, Jamaica
 has playea an active role in the North-South dialogue
 involving international economic issues of importance
 to the less developed countries.
 The Jamaican Government has publicly criticized human
 rights violations in many Latin American countries,
 although not in Cuba. Jamaica is a signatory of all
 ma3or human rights conventions.
 During 1978, the Government and Prime Minister
 Naniey were criticized by the opposition Jamaican
 Labor Party (JLP) ano the large independent newspaper,
 The Gleaner, for alleged violations of human rights.
 The criticism centerea on alleged voting irregularities
 in 1976 and on alleged torture and murder by a branch
 ot the Jamaican Defense Force. hanley denied the allega-
 tions and appointea a sole Commissioner, the highly
 respected Chief Justice, to look into them, as well as
 corruption charges against senior Government officials.
 Oticial corruption, sometimes at high levels, has
 
 
 286
 occurred in Jamaica, but is not institutionalized.
 The beneficiaries of most revealed instances of such
 corruption nave been successfully prosecuted.
 I. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 Torture is prohibitea by law., although the opposition
 party ana journalists have accused the Military Intel-
 ligence Unit (NIU) of the Jamaican Defense Force of
 torture and murder. These critics do not charge the
 Governmlent with promoting systematic or widespread
 torture. Rather, they assert the Government has created
 an atmosphere in which those few in the MIU, who have
 allegealy usea torture, may have concluded it would
 be condoned. The courts are considering the murder
 charges.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 There are legal prohibitions against cruel, inhuman
 ana degrading treatment or punishment. Except for the
 allegations of officially condoned torture mentioned
 above, there are no major complaints. Conditions in
 Jamaican prisons are fair. There is no extrajudicial
 system ot punishment. There are reports that the police
 shoot at suspects without adequate justification. This
 propensity is generally attributed to the high level of
 violent crime in Jamaica.
 c. Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 Since the state of emergency lapsed in June 1977, arbi-
 trary detention without trial has ceased. However, a
 "Gun Court," established in 1976 as an extraordinary means
 of meeting the serious and growing problem of violent crime,
 is not subject to habeas corpus;
 
 
 287
 a. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 With the exception of those tried by the "Gun Court,'
 whicn considers cases involving the illegal use or
 possession of firearms, all accused persons are
 given full and fair public trial. The 'Gun Court,'
 however, given its limited application of rules
 of eviaence, could not meet the usual criteria for
 juaicial fairness.
 e. Invasion of the Home
 The laws prohibiting arbitrary invasion of the home
 appear to be generally followed, though there have
 been a number of allegations of police abuses in
 this area. The allegations are under investigation.
 2. Governmental Policies Relating to the Fulfillment
 of Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care
 and Eaucation
 The current Government has pledged itself to fulfill
 the vital neeas of all, especially the poor. Among
 other things, it has organized programs to employ the
 urban poor. Overall expenditures addressing the needs
 of the poor constitute about 35 percent of the Govern-
 ment's current budget. While the total of such expendi-
 tures has declined in real terms since the previous
 budget, expenditures for agriculture, health and family
 planning services have maintained their relative shares
 for the past several years. However, severe economic dif-
 ficulties and problems of administration have greatly cur-
 tailed the effectiveness of the Government's efforts. Mal-
 nutrition is increasing. The gap between the rich and poor
 remains wide. Allegations that PNP adherents have dispro-
 portionately benefitted from some Government programs are
 under investigation.

 The rights of men and women to jobs and income are
 erï¿½ual unaer Jamaican law. Women generally en3oy
 these rights in practice. Women occupy positions
 of responsibility in all walks of life. The wife
 of the Prime Minister is an active spokesperson
 for full participation of women in Jamaican society.
 3.   Respect tor Civil and Political Liberties, Includ-
 ing:
 a. Freedom of Thought, Speech, Press, Religion
 and Assembly
 Freedom of religion, thought and speech are guaran-
 teed in Chapter III of the Constitution and observed
 in practice. Jamaicans are free to express them-
 selves, and often oo, on any sub3ect without tear
 of reprisal. The Government has periodically sought
 to restrain press criticism through veiled threats
 regarding newsprint allocation and Government advertising.
 Although these threats have had no detectable inhibiting
 effect on the press, there is concern that the Government
 radio and television monopoly has circumscribed the
 inaependence of these media. A permit is still required
 for public meetings, a measure deemed necessary
 as a result of Jamaica's uneasy internal security
 situation.
 b. Freeaom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel and Emigration
 The treedom to move within and to enter Jamaica is
 specifically guaranteed in Chapter III of the Constitution.
 There are no restrictions on foreign travel or emigration,
 but controls on the availability of foreign exchange
 significantly inhibit travel abroad.
 c. Freeaom to Participate in the Political Process
 This is one of the freedoms that the opposition
 Jamaican Labor Party claims has been eroded. The opposi-
 tion asserts that the 1976 parliamentary election was
 
 
 characterizeo by widespread fraud and intimidation. A
 by-election in 1978 in which all but the official PNP
 canciaates and a political unknown were prevented from
 registering tor nomination by a rough PNP mob strength-
 enea the assertion. However, Prime Minister Manley quickly
 rescheduled the nomination, and the process was completed
 peacefully. Manley has offered to introduce electoral
 retorms, and the opposition has tentatively accepted some
 oi the Government's proposals. The key element in the
 reform proposals is an independent election commission
 to monitor the entire election process from nomination
 to vote tallying.
 Labor unions operate freely and openly and play an
 important role in Jamaica's political and economic life.
 The many church groups are influential collectively,
 often compelling the Government to more moderate courses
 of action on a variety of national problems.
 4. Government Attitude ana Record Regarding Inter-
 national and Non-governmental Investigation of
 Allegeo Violations of Human Rights
 Prime Minister- Manley is on record as inviting Amnesty
 International to visit any time to investigate allegations
 of violations of human rights in Jamaica.
 The opposition party recently wrote to the Inter-American
 Human Rights Commission claiming violations, but so far
 there seems to have been no response. On balance, the
 Government of Jamaica appears to welcome international
 investigation.
