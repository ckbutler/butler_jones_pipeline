 ST. CHRISTOPHER AND NEVIS
 St. Christopher and Nevis, commonly known as St. Kitts and
 Nevis, is the newest of the English-speaking Eastern Caribbean
 island states. The United Kingdom granted independence to the
 two islands on September 19, 1983. The Constitution
 established rules for a parliamentary system based on elections
 to be held at least every five years. It also provides the
 smaller island of Nevis considerable self-government as well as
 the right to withdraw from the federation on six-month's
 notice. The new nation has a popularly elected, functioning
 government based on the British parliamentary system. There is
 an active and vocal political opposition.
 The economic system is mixed. Most commercial enterprises are
 privately owned. However, the sugar industry, which is the
 largest in the country, and 85 percent of all arable land are
 owned by state corporations.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:

 are housed in an outmoded jaill visits by family members,
 attorneys, and clergy are regularly permitted.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Constitutional guarantees prohibit arbitrary arrest and
 detention. Habeas corpus provisions require that any one

 politicians have made unsubstantiated charges that the present
 Government has been involved in politically motivated arrests.
 There were no reported cases of exile.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The Constitution requires that every accused person receive a
 fair, speedy, and public trial. The judiciary is highly
 regarded and independent. Like most of the English-speaking
 Caribbean, St. Christopher and Nevis is served by the West
 Indies Court of Appeal. Legal assistance is available to
 indigent defendents.

 Each of the large political parties publishes a weekly or

 Government-owned and operated television station, and spokesmen
 for various organizations have aired their views on the

 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to
 Change Their Government
 St. Christopher and Nevis has a multi-party political system,
 encompassing a wide variety of political views. The
 Constitution sets the voting age at 18. Political parties are
 free to conduct their activities. Every party holds some type
 of annual convention.
 The present government is a coalition of two of the country's
 three major political parties:  the People's Action Movement,
 led by Prime Minister Dr. Kennedy A. Simmonds; and the Nevis
 Reformation Party, headed by Simeon Daniel, Minister of Finance
 and the newly designated Premier of Nevis. In the 1980
 national election, these two parties won five of the nine
 contested seats, and overturned the Labor Party Government
 which had ruled for 36 consecutive years, under British
 colonial administration. In the 1983 elections for the Nevis
 island assembly, the Nevis Reformation Party swept all five
 seats.

 Section 4 Government Attitude Regarding Internationa and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Internationally recognized human rights organizations have not
 commented on the human rights situation in St. Christopher and
 Nevis, nor has anyone requested an investigation or called for
 inquiries into alleged violations. The Government is firmly
 committed to the promotion of human rights and is sensitive to
 any criticism related to the issue. Freedom House in 1983
 rated St. Kitts and Nevis "free" while Amnesty International
 did not have a section on the country in its 1983 report.
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 The economy of St. Christopher and Nevis is just emerging from
 a period of decline. Beginning in 1981, with the worldwide
 recession coupled with falling sugar prices, the economy of the
 country stagnated and total revenues needed for capital
 development projects fell by 13 percent. The Gross Domestic
 Product (GDP) was estimated at $45 million in 1983 or
 approximately $920 per capita.
 The Government has developed a program of economic
 diversification to increase earnings in tourism, manufacturing,
 and agricultural production other than sugar, which remains the
 single most important revenue producer in the economy. It
 accounted for 17 percent of GDP in 1983.
 St. Christopher and Nevis has an estimated population of 47,700
 and one of the lowest population growth rates in the area,
 averaging 0.2 percent from 1972 to the present. The birth rate
 is 29 per 1000; while infant mortality rate remains high at 43
 per thousand live births.
