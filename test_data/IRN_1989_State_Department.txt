 Iran is an Islamic Republic under the leadership of Ayatollah
 Ali Khamenei, who succeeded Grand Ayatollah Khomeini after
 Khomeini's death in June. The'formal system of government,
 based on a Constitution approved in 1980 by popular referendum
 and revised in July 1989, features a parliament and a
 president elected from among multiple candidates by universal
 suffrage. However, all candidates must meet highly
 restrictive religious and political criteria imposed by the
 Council of Guardians, and as a result the choice offered to
 voters is narrow. The Government is dominated by a political
 elite composed of Shi'a Muslim clerics and of laymen allied
 with these clerics which attempts to impose its views on
 political and socioreligious orthodoxy. However, there are
 significant factional differences on important economic and
 political issues, such as private property ownership and
 relations with the West.
 The Government's hold on power is reinforced through arrests,
 summary trials and executions, and other forms of intimidation
 implemented by an extensive internal security system.
 Political arrests are made by the Revolutionary Guards or,
 less commonly, by revolutionary committees (komitehs), local
 neighborhood groups which once were quasi-official but which
 have now been subsumed under the Ministry of Interior. In
 practice, these groups retain a certain amount of autonomy,
 particularly in the provinces, and the central Government is
 sometimes unable to control their activities fully.
 The disruptions of the revolution, the devastation of the
 Iran-Iraq war, and government mismanagement have caused
 serious economic deterioration in Iran. Inflation is probably
 above 50 percent, while unemployment is about 40 percent of
 the work force. Many industries are operating at less than
 half capacity. Corruption and black market activities are
 rife. The Government has not yet made many key decisions
 regarding reconstruction strategy and economic development;
 these include the nature and level of foreign participation in
 reconstruction, the role of the private sector, and government
 versus private'control of foreign trade.
 Iran continued in 1989 to be a major violator of human
 rights. Abuses includedisummary executions of political
 opponents; widespread torture; repression of the freedoms of
 speech, press, assembly and association; arbitrary detentions;
 lack of fair trials; continuing repression of the Baha'i
 religious community; denial of the right of citizens to change
 their government; and severe restrictions on women's and
 worker rights. In his inaugural speech in July, President
 Rafsanjani pledged that the Government would respect the
 "freedom and dignity of individuals." Although the Government
 implemented a series of steps to regularize judicial
 procedures and bring the security forces under closer
 supervision, by year's end it was not apparent that the
 patternof abuses noted above had been significantly altered.
 Both Amnesty International (AI), in its 1989 Report covering
 1988, and the U.N.'s Special Rapporteur for Iran, Reynaldo
 Galindo Pohl, cited instances of torture, execution after

 summary proceedings,-and the holding of political prisoners as
 among continuing human rights abuses in Iran. According to
 Galindo Pohl, the Government of Iran acknowledged the
 large-scale-executions which took place during the last
 several months of 1988. He concluded that "acts are being
 committed in -Iran that are incompatible with international
 human rights instruments that are binding on the Iranian
 Government."
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. -Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 The total number of people killed for political reasons in
 1989 is unknown. Given the lack of basic procedural safeguards
 in political trials, most of the executions ordered each year
 in such cases amount to summary executions. Moreover, the
 Government often cloaks political charges with accusations of
 criminal activity, e.g., narcotics trafficking.
 A rash of political executions which began in the late summer
 of 1988--and claimed between several hundred and several
 thousand lives--subsided in early 1989. Under a new antidrug
 law announced in late 1988, the Government executed hundreds
 of accused drug traffickers throughout the year, a number of
 whom, according to a variety of sources, were actually
 political detainees.
 In August AI reported that 851 persons had been executed for
 alleged drug-related offenses, out of a total of over 1,200
 executions during the year for criminal offenses. Many of
 those killed were hanged en masse in cities around the
 country, some from construction cranes.
 In its 1989 Report, AI also charged that secret executions of
 political prisoners was common.
 The Government has sought to reduce the time between
 commission of a capital crime and the execution of the accused
 to a period of 10 days. In a February statement, the
 country's highest judicial authority stated that the new
 directives were being followed and prisoners were being
 executed within a very few days.
 b. Disappearance
 The number of disappearances in 1989 is unknown.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Accounts of torture in Iran's prisons continued to be received
 in 1989 and included a wide range of inhuman practices.
 According to various human rights groups and eyewitness
 accounts, floggings, mock executions, and suspension from the
 ceiling are common methods of torture, as are threats of
 sexual abuse of female prisoners and female relatives of male
 prisoners. Al reports that relatives of political suspects
 have been imprisoned to pressure the suspects to give
 themselves up. Guards have threatened to torture family
 members of detainees, and relatives or other prisoners have
 occasionally been forced to watch torture. A number of
 
 
 1402
 prisoners, including young children, have been 'raped by
 Revolutionary Guards. According to the United Nations Special
 Rapporteur, one eyewitness reported the torture of women
 prisoners immediately after giving birth.
 Beatings of all'kinds, both by single guards and by several
 guards at once, are common.- Allegedly, prisoners are flogged
 on the soles of their feet until they can no longer walk.
 Brutal common criminals have reportedly been introduced among
 political prisoners and incited to torture and rape the other
 prisoners.
 The U.N. Special Rapporteur, in a report issued in 1988, noted.
 that torture in Iranian prisons has become more
 sophisticated. Steps allegedly have been taken to eliminate
 traces of physical torture, including the use of new types of
 cables to beat prisoners, and the physical separation of
 tortured prisoners from other inmates until'all marks of abuse
 have disappeared. A machine is reportedly used to perforate
 the soles of feet after they have been flogged to reduce the
 swelling.
 Prisoner protests against the inhuman conditions in Iranian
 prisons have reportedly been met with beatings, denial of
 medical care, and, in some cases, execution.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Arrests for expression of views critical of or different from
 those of the Government were known to occur in the past, but
 it is not known how many may have occurred in 1989.
 In the past, some persons have been arrested on trumped-up
 criminal charges when their actual "offenses" were political.
 Individuals were taken into custody on vague charges such as
 "corruption on earth" or "crimes against God." The lack of
 fair trials and other procedural safeguards encourage such
 practices.
 No judicial determination of the legality of detention exists
 in Iranian law. There is reportedly no legal time limit on
 incommunicado detention. Suspects are held for questioning at
 local Revolutionary Guard offices or in jails.
 There have been reports that children often have been taken
 into custody with their mothers. Some women have been
 imprisoned solely because they have associated with men who
 are political suspects.
 In February the Government announced an amnesty for imprisoned
 members of banned opposition organizations that applied to
 2,600 persons out of a total of 3,500 the Government admitted
 had been imprisoned for political activities. According to
 the Government, the amnesty did not apply to those who
 committed serious crimes in the course of these activities.
 The Government claimed that all 2,600 were released but there
 was no independent confirmation, and opposition elements have
 claimed that few of those supposedly amnestied have returned
 home. In October the Chief of the Judicial Branch announced
 another amnesty and a reduction in the sentences of those who
 were convicted by "public, military, and Islamic revolutionary
 courts." The program, which was made subject to numerous
 conditions, has not been fully implemented, and no figures are
 available on the number released.
 
 
 1403
 IRAN
 With regard to forced or compulsory labor, see Section 6.c.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 There are essentially two different court systems. The
 civilian courts deal with criminal offenses, and the
 revolutionary courts, established in 1979, try "political"
 offenses.
 No trial by a revolutionary court can be called fair or public
 in the usual sense. If the trial is staged publicly, it is
 generally because the prisoner has already been forced to
 confess to a crime. Individuals tried for political offenses
 enjoy virtually no procedural or substantive safeguards.
 The U.N. Special Rapporteur noted in a special report in 1989
 that reports continued to be received about the lack of many
 basic procedural guarantees. Defendants reportedly did not
 have access to a defense lawyer, were unable to call witnesses
 on their behalf, and were unable to appeal. Some persons have
 been blindfolded during their trial. AI has reported that
 many convictions are based on confessions extracted under
 torture.during incommunicado pretrial detention. Some
 individuals have been imprisoned beyond the limit of their
 sentence, and even executed after the formal expiration of
 their prison term.
 Restraints on arbitrary actions of the revolutionary courts
 were reportedly severely weakened in 1985 by a government
 decision to limit the review authority of the Supreme Court.
 The judicial system is further weakened by the fact that
 revolutionary courts can consider cases formally under the
 jurisdiction of the civil and criminal courts. Assignment of
 cases to regular rather than revolutionary courts is haphazard
 and apparently occurs.mainly when-arrests are made by regular
 police. Revolutionary courts can also overturn the decisions
 of civilian courts.
 For common criminal-offenses, many elements of the
 prerevolutionary judicial system survive, and the accused
 often have the right to a public trial with benefit of lawyers
 of their own choosing, assuming they can afford the fee. Even
 this judiciary is not fully independent, however. Many of the
 former judges were retired after the revolution, and new
 judges selected. One criterion for new judges is grounding in
 Islamic law, and political acceptability is a requirement for
 any government position. Favorable verdicts reportedly can
 often be "purchased" from the judges serving on civil and
 criminal courts and to a lesser degree from judges of the
 revolutionary courts.
 No reliable estimate is available on the number of political
 prisoners. In its 1989 Report, Al, noting that 1,200
 political prisoners had been executed, estimated that
 "thousands of others" remained in prison.
 f.- Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Government rejects the Western distinction between a
 public sphere which the state may control and a sphere of
 private life (religion, culture, thought, and private
 behavior) which the State may not properly control.
 
 
 1404
 IRANi
 Authorities still enter homes, tap phones, and open mail, but
 these activities seem to occur less frequently now than in
 previous years.
 Special Revolutionary Guard units and neighborhood komitehs
 check on social activities. Women whose clothing does not
 completely cover the hair and all of the body except hands and
 face, or who wear makeup, are technically subject to arrest.
 In the past, men have also been required to dress "modestly,"
 eschewing, for example, short-sleeved shirts. In 1989 the
 social climate reportedly became somewhat more tolerant after
 the death of Khomeini; the komitehs were said to be much less
 in evidence on the streets. As the year ended, however, there.
 were some reports that the momentum seemed to have changed,
 and there was closer application of Islamic standards of dress
 and conduct.
 Section 2' Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution states that "publications and the press may
 express ideas freely, except when they are contrary to Islamic
 principles, or are detrimental to public rights." In
 practice, most publidations are controlled by the Government;
 independent publishers run the risk not only of press
 shutdowns and confiscation of publications and equipment but
 of arrest and summary punishment if they are overly critical
 of the Government.
 All books must'be submitted to the Ministry of Islamic
 Guidance for censorship before they can be published.
 Publishers, authors, and printers also engage in substantial
 self-censorship before submitting books to the Ministry in an
 effort to avoid the substantial penalties, including economic
 lQsses, incurred when books are rejected.
 Newspapers, which are usually associated with various
 government factions, reflect a variety of viewpoints.
 Officifals and government policies are often subjected to
 public'criticism, but newspapers are forbidden to criticize
 the concept of'the Islamic republic, or to promote'ethnic
 minority rights. Nevertheless, some independent publishers
 out of favor with the Government continue to survive, and some
 books and pamphlets critical of the Government are published
 without reprisal. Foreign books, newspapers, andmagazines
 may be imported-only after they have been censored.
 All broadcasting facilities are government owned.
 The severity of restrictions on academic freedom has been
 relaxed somewhat in recent years. However, course content is
 still monitored, and there is little genuine critical
 discussion of issues. To achieve tenure, professors
 reportedly must cooperate with government authorities over a
 period of years. All textbooks proposed for use at the.
 universities are reviewed by government authorities to
 determine their acceptability.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Constitution permits unarmed assemblies and marches
 "provided they do not violate the principles of Islam." The
 
 
 1405
 only ones permitted in practice are those sponsored by the
 Government, such as Friday prayers and sermons and parades on
 official occasions.
 The Constitution allows the formation of political parties,
 groups, and professional associations, as well as Islamic and
 some minority religious associations, provided they do not
 violate the principles of "freedom sovereignty, [and]
 national unity" or question Islam or the Islamic Republic. In
 practice, most independent organizations have either been
 banned, co-opted by the Government, or are moribund.
 For a discussion of freedom of association as it applies to
 labor unions, see Section 6.a.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 In Iran religion is almost inseparable from government. The
 President and many other top officials are mullahs (Islamic
 clergymen), as are the Speaker of the Parliament and nearly
 half the deputies in Parliament.
 Approximately 90 percent of Iranians are Shi'a Muslims. Aside
 from slightly over 1 percent who are non-Muslims (Baha'is,
 Christians, Zoroastrians, and Jews), the rest are Sunni
 Muslims. The Sunnis are mostly Kurds, Arabs, Turkomans,
 Baluch, and other ethnic minorities whose political influence
 is very limited. The Constitution declares that "the official
 religion of Iran is Islam and the sect followed is Ja'fari
 Shi'ism," but it also states that "other Islamic denominations
 shall enjoy complete respect."
 The small Christian, Jewish, and Zoroastrian (the pre-Islamic
 religion of Iran) populations are concentrated mainly in urban
 areas. Their religions are recognized by the Constitution,
 and they elect representatives to seats reserved for them in
 the Parliament. They are permitted to practice their
 religions, to instruct their children, and--although with a
 great deal of disruptive interference--to maintain schools.
 The Government continues to discriminate against the Baha'i
 community, Iran's largest non-Muslim minority (300,000 to
 350,000 members). The Special Representative stated in his
 1989 Report that information he received indicated that
 Baha'is are still being harassed for their faith. The Baha'i
 religion, an offshoot of Islam, is considered a "misguided
 sect" by the authorities and is not officially recognized.
 Between 1979 and 1988 the Baha'is suffered severe persecution,
 mainly government directed and aimed at the religious
 leadership.
 In 1983 the Prosecutor General issued an order that
 effectively banned all Baha'i religious activity and provided
 the legal foundation on which virtually all members of the
 faith can be charged with crimes. Baha'i property was
 confiscated, shrines demolished, businesses disbanded or
 confiscated, and known Baha'is denied public sector employment
 and social services. Bahali marriages are still not
 recognized. Baha'is are forbidden to participate in social
 welfare organizations, their businesses are outlawed, and they
 may not teach their faith. Baha'i national leaders dissolved
 the community's organizations in obedience to the Prosecutor
 General's edict, but they subsequently were arrested, and at
 least some were executed. Many ordinary Baha'is were also
 arrested on vague charges.
 
 
 1406
 In some important respects, the Government has ameliorated its
 treatment of Baha'is. No Baha'is were reported to have been
 arrested or executed in 1989; the number of Bahais held in
 prison fell to fewer than 15. A small number of Bahai's have
 been issued visas to leave the country. Some Baha'i property
 confiscated by the Government was returned, although the
 amount represents a fraction of the total seized. Baha'i
 children are now permitted to attend grade school and high
 school (although Baha'is cannot attend college or be employed
 on college faculties). Some Baha'is were allowed quietly to
 reopen their businesses.
 The Government has not officially abandoned its anti-Baha'i
 policies; widespread discrimination against, and persecution
 of, the community persists. -The Government continues to
 attack the Baha'i community as a front for political and
 espionage activities, and prohibits the community from
 electing leaders or conducting religious activities.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Iranians may travel to any part of Iran, although there have
 been restrictions on travel to Kurdish areas at times of heavy
 fighting. Persons may change their place of residence without
 obtaining permission.
 Travel outside Iran is considerably easier now than before
 1983. Khomeini's decree of December 1982 established the
 right to travel abroad; prior to that time passports and exit
 visas had been difficult to obtain. In 1989, however, there
 was evidence that airport departure procedures were again
 tightened, and the exit tax was increased sharply.
 Males of draft age are not issued exit visas except for
 approved courses of study, and Iranians who are suspect
 politically, such as some retired military officers and
 high-level public officials under the former regime, are not
 able to leave. Persons who have not repaid loans obtained
 from development banks under the old government also are
 denied exit visas. Reportedly some Iranians, particularly
 those whose skills are in short supply and who were educated
 at government expense, must post bonds to obtain exit visas.
 Iranian Jews are permitted to obtain passports and to travel,
 but they are normally denied the multiple-exit visas given to
 most Iranians and must make a fresh application (with a fresh
 fee) for each planned trip. Permission is not normally
 granted for all members of a Jewish family to travel outside
 Iran at the same time.
 Iranians are generally able to return to Iran after long
 periods abroad without reprisal. Since the cease-fire, the
 Government has encouraged the many thousands of skilled
 Iranians living abroad to return to help rebuild the country.
 Of those'who have gone back in recent years, a number have
 been able to pursue, through the Iranian judicial system, the
 return of their properties. However, many exiles complain
 that formal legal guarantees of their safety have not yet been
 provided, and as a result, many remain reluctant to return.
 There are some categories of individuals who may be in danger
 if they return to Iran. Some of those with close ties to the
 former regime, draft evaders, and those who departed the
 country illegally face possible arrest upon their return.
 
 
 1407
 IRAN
 Members or sympathizers with the People's Mojahedin
 Organization of Iran, an-opposition group, are subject to
 imprisonment and torture or even execution should they return.
 Nevertheless, immediate relatives of persons wanted by the
 Government are often able to live in Iran, travel outside, and
 return without undue difficulty.
 Iranian passports have always been stamped "not valid for
 emigration," but the Government does not make a clear
 distinction between legal residence in another country and
 emigration. According to the regulations, Iranians with a
 legal residence outside Iran may be issued passports and
 advance exit visas by the Iranian embassy, consulate, or
 interests section in their country of residence. Iranians who
 have acquired U.S. citizenship are considered Iranian (in
 effect dual nationals) unless they have formally renounced
 their Iranian citizenship in accordance with Iranian law.
 Dual nationals have complained that the Iranian Interests
 Section in Washington will neither give them visas in their
 U.S. passports nor issue them Iranian passports and exit visas
 on the grounds that their residence in the United States is
 not legal because, according to Iranian law, they emigrated
 illegally. Although such services may be denied, there are no
 known instances of the denial of Iranian citizenship to
 Iranians who left Iran, or to those who have remained there.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Iran is ruled by a group of religious leaders (mullahs) and
 their lay associates who share a belief in the legitimacy of a
 theocratic state based on Ayatollah Khomeini's interpretation
 of Shi'a Islam. Citizens are not free to question or to
 change this form of government.
 The revolutionary Government has held elections at fairly
 regular intervals for president, Parliament deputies, members
 of the Council of Experts (responsible for choosing Khomeini's
 successor), and members of local government councils.
 Presidential elections were held in July, and by-elections for
 Parliament were contested in December. All elections have
 been-hard-fought, generally with several candidates for every
 position. Voting is by universal suffrage. All candidates
 must be approved by the Counckl of Guardians, however, and
 only those meeting the Council's vaguely described political
 and religious criteriw.may-zun. In practice, only supporters
 of the theocratic state are accepted.
 Although the Ministry of Interior announced in December 1988
 - that political parties would be allowed to form, provided they
 met the Government's religious and political criteria, only
 - onewas licensed. After Khomeini's death, the movement toward
 legalization of more political parties appeared to end.
 The independence of the Parliament is established in the
 Constitution and exists to a large degree in practice. While
 Parliament deputies are typically allied with various powerful
 political and religious officials, they may speak and vote
 independently and may shift from one faction to another.
 Vigorous parliamentary debates--normally covered- extensively
 in the press--cover a wide variety of issues. Harsh criticism
 of government officials is often heard in these debates, and,
 in some cases, laws proposed by the executive branch have been
 voted down.
 
 
 1408
 The Constitution provides for a Council of Guardians composed
 of 12 members: 6 clerics unilaterally appointed by the
 Leader, and 6 lay members well grounded in Islamic law who are
 nominated by the head of the Judicial Council, subject to the
 Parliament's approval. The Council of Guardians must certify
 all bills passed by the Parliament as being in accordance with
 Islamic law and the Constitution. If bills fail to be
 certified, they are sent back to the Parliament for revision.
 They cannot become law until passed by the Parliament and
 certified by the Council.
 The Council has rejected various important bills and portions
 of bills passed by the Parliament, including legislation on
 land 'reform, foreign trade, private enterprise, the press
 code, and reform of the civil code.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government has been uncooperative with foreign human
 rights groups, whether government sponsored or independent,
 regarding their activities as interference in the country's
 internal affairs. Foreign diplomats stationed in Tehran who
 attempt to develop information about human rights abuses face
 strong interference from Iranian authorities. There are no
 internal human rights groups.
 In its 1989 Report, AI said that during 1988 it had repeatedly
 asked the Government for information about charges against
 persons sentenced to death or executed, and asked about trial
 procedures followed in cases involving the death penalty. It
 also called for an end to political executions, flogging and
 amputations, the release of political prisoners, and
 guarantees of fair trials within a reasonable time. AI also
 asked the Government several times to allow a delegation to
 visit Iran to discuss human rights concerns. AI said the
 Government did not respond to any of these inquiries.
 The Government has opposed efforts in the United Nations to
 criticize its record on human rights. Nevertheless,
 resolutions expressing the United Natigns' concern about human
 rights abuseb in Iran have passed'ahnually in the General
 Assembly and in meetings of the U.N. Human Rights Commission
 (UNHRC). In referring to the finding of his 1988 Report, the
 U.N. Special Representative stated in his 1989 interim Report
 that he maintains his conviction that acts are being committed
 in Iran that are incompatible with international human rights
 instruments that are binding on the Iranian Government.
 Since 1984 the Government has refused to allow a UNHRC Special
 Representative to enter Iran to prepare his reports and has
 not commented on human rights violations submitted for its
 consideration. However, in November Iran's Permanent
 Representative to the U.N. presented a letter to the Special
 Representative inviting him to visit Iran to prepare a report
 on the human rights situation there. The report is scheduled
 to be presented to the 46th session of the UNHRC in February.
 However, the modalities of the visit have yet to be worked out.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Women, always the object of discriminatory practices in Iran's
 conservative society, have faced even more discrimination
 
 
 1409
 since the revolution. Witnesses who presented testimony to
 the U.N. Special Representative reported the torture and
 execution of women detainees, some of whom were raped before
 execution. Ultraconservative dress, entirely hiding the hair
 and all of the body except the face and hands, is a
 requirement for all women, regardless of their religion,
 national origin, or citizenship. In the past, women have been
 harassed, detained, or physically attacked if they appeared in
 public in clothing which official or self-appointed guardians
 of public morality deemed insufficiently modest. However, as
 noted in Section l.f., women in 1989 reportedly enjoyed
 somewhat greater freedom in dress and appearance although
 proponents of orthodoxy remained strong.
 The Family Protection Act, passed under the Shah, was revoked
 by the Islamic Government and replaced by a civil code
 reflecting Islamic law. A bill passed in mid-1983 did give
 women the right to divorce their husbands, and regulations
 announced in 1984 substantially broadened to 12 the number of
 grounds for which a woman may seek divorce. A husband may
 obtain a divorce without having to state a reason or go to
 court. The new marriage regulations provide for improved
 financial settlements for wives whose husbands divorce them.
 Although violence against women is known to occur in Iran,
 little is known about its extent. Abuse within the family is
 considered a private matter in this conservative society and
 is seldom discussed publicly. There are no official
 statistics on the subject.
 The Christian, Jewish, Zoroastrian, and Baha'i minorities
 suffer varying degrees of officially sanctioned discrimination
 in a number of areas, particularly with respect to employment,
 education, and public accommodations. Muslims who have
 converted to Christianity are similarly discriminated
 against. For example, one requirement of university admission
 is passing a test on Islamic theology, which has the effect of
 excluding most religious minorities from higher education.
 Applicants for public sector employment are similarly screened
 for adherence to standards of Islamic orthodoxy, with much the
 same effect. There have also been reports that religious
 minorities have suffered discrimination in the legal system,
 such as receiving lower awards in.injury and death lawsuits,
 and of suffering heavier punishments than those imposed on
 Muslims. Although Sunnis have encountered religious
 discrimination on the local level, the Government has made
 efforts to reduce Shila-Sunni antagonism.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 There are no real labor unions. A national organization known
 as the "Labor House," founded in 1982 as the labor branch of
 the now defunct Islamic Republican Party, is the only
 authorized national labor organization. It works closely with
 the Islamic societies-and 'Islamic labor councils" set up in
 most Iranian factories. Labor House is headed by Hossein
 Kamali, the Minister of Labor; as such, it is largely a
 conduit of government influence, not a trade union founded by
 workers to represent their interests.
 The officially sanctioned Islamic labor councils also are
 instrumdnts of government control and not bodies created and
 
 
 1410
 controlled by workers to advance their own interests, although
 they have frequently been able to block layoffs or the firing
 of workers.
 There is also a system of "guild unions," which operates on a
 regional basis. These guild unions issue vocational licenses,
 fund financial cooperatives to assist members, and help
 workers to.find jobs. -The guild unions operate with the
 cooperation of the Government.
 No information-is available on the right of workers in Iran to
 strike. No strikes are known to have taken place in 1989.
 .b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 In practice, the right of workers to organize independently
 and bargain collectively is extremely limited.
 It is not known whether labor legislation and practice in the
 export processing zones differ in any significant respect from
 the rest of the country. -
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 The International Labor Organization (ILO) Committee of
 Experts (COE), said in its 1989 report that it looked forward
 to learning of the repeal of Section 273 of the Penal Code.
 In its previous comments, the COE had stated that this
 provision, which compelled able-bodied citizens to engage in
 gainful occupation, was incompatible with the ILO Convention
 on Forced Labor and should be amended. The Government
 indicated that the Penal Code, which would abolish this
 section, has been adopted by the Council of Ministers and
 presented to the Parliament for final approval.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 Iranian -labor law, which exempts agriculture, domestic
 service, family businesses, and, to some extent, other small
 businesses, forbids employment of minors under 12 years and
 places special restrictions on the employment of minors under
 18. In addition, women and minors may not be used for hard
 labor or, in general, for night work. The extent to which
 these regulations are enforced is not known.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 The labor law establishes a 6-day workweek of 48 hours maximum
 (except for overtime at premium rates), with 1 day of rest
 (normally Friday) per week as well as at least 12 days per
 year of leave with pay and a number of paid public holidays.
 There ate also legal provisions with respect to minimum wages
 and health and safety in workplaces. Further information on

 unions, it is unclear to what extent the provisions of Iran's
 labor law affect most of the labor force.
