 LATVIA
 In 1991 Latvia regained its independence after some 50 years of
 Soviet occupation. The United States Government, which had not
 recognized the forcible annexatio: of Latvia by the Union of
 Soviet Socialist Republics (U.S.S.R.) in1940, resumed full
 diplomatic relations with the Latvian Government in September.
 The Soviet Government recognized Latvia's independence, and
 Latvia was admitted as a member of the United Nations in that
 same month.
 In January and again in August 1991,-Soviet political and
 military forces tried forcibly to overthrow the legitimate
 .Latvian authorities. After occupying the central publishing
 house in Riga, the capital,.Sogiet Interior Ministry special
 forces on January 20 stormed-the Latvian.Interior Ministry,
 causing the deaths of two local militia guards pnd several
 civilians. A self-proclaimed "Committeeof National Salvation"
 announced it was taking over the functions of the Latvian
 Government, but after several weeks-of confrontation the
 legitimate Latvian authorities, retained control.of the,
 country. Residents of Latvia confirmed their strong support
 for independence at the ballot box on March 3 in a nonbinding
 "advisory" referendum.
 During the attempted coup against Soviet President Gorbachev in
 August,,which was welcomed by the Latvian Communist. Party,
 Soviet Interior Ministry-special-forces (Black Berets) shot a
 Latvian motorist to death and killed three other civilians.
 The arrest of the coup leaders in Moscow marked the end of the
 attempted coup in Latvia as well. The Latvian.Government
 subsequently outlawed the Communist party.
 Latvia is a parliamentary democracy. The highest legislative
 authority is the Supreme Council, and its Chairman serves as
 Head of State. A prime minister, elected by the Parliament, is
 the chief executive official. Day-to-day government operations
 are the responsibility of the Council-of Ministers, elected by
 the Parliament and directed by the Prime Minister. The 1922
 Constitution was restored in August. Pending the adoption of a
 new constitution, theParliament in December adopted a
 constitutional law providing for basic rights and freedoms.
 The Latvian economy in 1991 remained largely dependent on that
 of the Soviet Union, but historically it has performed better
 than the Soviet economy. Latvian authorities undertook
 significant price reforms in 1991, allowing many prices'to rise
 closer to market levels than ever before. Efforts are under
 way to privatize agriculture and return property nationalized
 by the Soviets to its rightful owners.
 On the whole, progress in the observance of human rights
 continued in 1991 in terms of respect for the individual afid
 civil liberties, although iegislative reforms that would
 institutionalize human rights improvements remain to be
 adopted. Questions about the ramifications of possible changes'
 in the citizenship law and implementation of the ban on the
 Communist Party remain unresolved.

 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.
 No such killings by Latvian authorities are known to have
 occurred.
 Soviet Interior Ministry special forces (Black Berets)
 precipitated a crisis on January 2 by forcibly occupying the
 central publishing house in Riga on the eve of its scheduled
 transformation into a joint stock company. As Latvians
 established barricades to protect important public buildings
 from Soviet takeover, a Black Beret unit on January 16 shot to
 death a Latvian truck driver whose vehicle was part of a
 barricade. On January 20, Black Berets-assaulted the Latvian
 Interior Ministry with automatic weapons, killing two local
 militia guards. Black Berets also killed two Latvian
 journalists and a teenage boy who, along with many other
 civilians, rushed to the scene when firing broke out.
 On August 19, the first day of the attempted coup against
 President Gorbachev, Black Berets shot to death a Latvian
 motorist who apparently refused to stop his vehicle when they
 fired warning shots into the air. Soviet forces killed three
 more civilians in other incidents before the coup attempt
 failed on August 21.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no known instances of abductions or disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment.
 Torture is prohibited under Article 15 of the Constitutional
 Law.
 Prisons in Latvia were administered under Soviet standards for
 much of the year. Prisoners were harshly treated during both
 interrogation and confinement in labor camps and prisons.
 Physical and psychological abuse of prisoners, overcrowding,
 and detention under extremely unhealthful conditions were
 common. Since the coup attempt, Latvian authorities have moved
 to correct such abuses.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Soviet Black Beret forces illegally detained civilians (e.g.,
 the director of the Latvian publishing house) as part of their
 prolonged campaign of harassment and intimidation. Between
 January and August, there were at least seven instances in
 which dozens of Latvians were detained, beaten, robbed, and
 killed by Black Beret forces. For example, between May and
 June, attacks on Latvian border post guards by Black Beret
 forces involved beating the border guards and stealing their
 personal possesions and the property of the border posts (e.g.,
 cars and typewriters). The Latvian prosecutor's office is
 investigating these incidents. Latvian authorities have not
 engaged in these practices. According to Article 15 of the
 Constitutional Law, a person may be detained for up to 72 hours
 without a judicial warrant. A system to check abuses of this
 requirement is not yet in place.

 LATVIA
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 There are two levels of courts in the Latvian judicial system:
 an "initial" court and an appeals-court. The present judicial
 system is based on the Soviet judicial system. A draft law on
 court reform is being reviewed by Parliament.
 While it is the aim of the Latvian authorities to develop a
 modern judicial system, efforts to reform it during the past
 year have been limited. Criminal procedural codes have been
 changed to make the-prosecutor independent. Detainees are now
 allowed the right to have their attorney present during
 questioning. Judicial operations were further hampered for
 much of the year by the presence of two procurators in Latvia,
 one relresenting the'local authorities and one loyal to
 Moscow. Ih general,-the Latvian judiciary appears to be
 independent of the executive authorities.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Constitutional Law provides for privacy of communications
 and residence, with certain exceptions. Until the August coup
 attempt, Soviet-controlled security organs interfered in the
 personal lives of citizens through the use of informers, the
 opening of mail, and technical surveillance, including
 wiretaps. They also continued to monitor the contacts of
 Latvians with foreigners. Latvian authorities are currently in
 the process of dismantling the Soviet state security structure
 on their soil. In August a decision was adopted eliminating
 the offices of-the-U.S.S.R. Committee for State Security (KGB)
 and othek-security organizations in Latvia and creating a
 Supreme7C6unbil Commission to oversee Latvia's takeover of
 property formerly belonging to these inetitutions.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom-of-Speech and Press
 Latvia enjoyed wide freedom of speech throughout 1991. There
 was unfettered criticism of both the Latvian and Soviet
 Governments; and no subject was off-limits. The Black Beret
 takeover of the central publishing house in Riga forced
 numerous newspapers and periodicals to find alternative means
 of publication through much of the year, but both Latvian and
 Russian-language papers appeared regularly. The Government
 allocates newsprint. State-owned enterprises control the
 central printing house which has been reorganized into a
 joint-stock company.
 The Latvian Press Law, made effective on January 1-, 1991,
 prohibits censorship of the press and other'mass media. The
 Constitutional Law contains provisions on free speech and
 press. These laws are being reviewed as part of parliamentary
 debates vis-a-vis privatization of the print media and
 restructuring of the broadcast media.
 The Supreme Council is debating different versions of a law
 regarding television and radio. Currently an FM radio station
 called "AA" is operating outside the control of the State
 Committee for Television and Radio. However, it relies heavily
 on government support. An independent television company has
 been formed but thus far has not been able to gain access to
 the airwaves. Several cable/satellite television companies
 
 
 1160
 LATVIA
 have sprung up throughout Latvia, and the number of privately
 owned television satellite dishes is growing rapidly.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.
 Latvian authorities legally have the power to prohibit public
 gatherings on grounds of, for example, fear of public disorder,
 but seldom exercise it. In 1991 numerous mass meetings and
 public gatherings took place without government interference.
 The Constitution provides for the right to associate in public
 organizations. As a result of the failed coup, however,
 the activities of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, as
 well as of other organizations which actively supported the
 coup (e.g., Interfront, a political organization representing
 mostly ethnic Russians in Latvia), were officially banned.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 The Government does not interfere in the exercise of religious
 freedom. The dominant faiths are Lutheran and Eastern
 Orthodox. Foreign evangelists are permitted to hold meetings
 and proselytize.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Since the U.S.S.R.'s recognition of Latvian independence,
 Soviet border officials have cooperated with Latvian
 authorities in the process of transferring border controls to
 the Latvians. Until trained Latvian replacements are
 available, Soviet border guards continue to function at most
 ports of entry. The number of Latvians traveling abroad has
 increased dramatically overthe past 2 to 3 years. Currently
 there are no obstacles to freedom of movement within the
 country, foreign travel, or repatriation.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government.
 Despite the determined efforts of conservative forces loyal to
 Moscow, Latvia succeeded in reestablishing its independence
 from the Soviet Union in August.
 There are several political parties and movements representing
 a wide array of'opinions. There is no discrimination, in law
 or in practice, against the participation of women in
 government and politics.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights.
 The Government welcomed visits by human rights organizations
 and received a delegation from the U.S. Commission on Security
 and Cooperation in Europe.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Discrimination on the basis of race, sex, or other grounds is
 prohibited in the Constitution. Tensions are present, however,
 in the relationship between ethnic Latvians and the large
 Russian population in Latvia. During the years of Soviet rule,
 there was a dramatic increase in the immigration of
 
 
 1161
 LATVIA
 non-Latvians, largely Russians, brought in as laborers and
 administrators.- Today Latvians constitute barely 50 percent of
 the populati6n.
 As a result, the issue of defining the requirements for
 citizenship is highly contentious. No final decisions have
 been made, but some groups in Latvia and abroad have been
 concerned by proposals which appear to be openly discriminatory
 against nonethnic Latvians.
 According to the Supreme Council's law on human rights and
 civic obligations only citizens may occupy state positions,
 establish political parties, own land, choose a place of abode
 on Latvian territory, leave Latvia, or return to it.
 According to the Chairman of the Supreme Council on Human
 Rights and Nationalities, there were no reported incidents of
 prejudice or discrimination aginst Gypsies. The Gypsies have
 organized their own national cultural society, which is one of
 20 other such societies.
 Women possess the same legal rights as men and, in addition,
 have significant day-care and maternity benefits. Women also,
 under the law, receive equal pay for equal work.
 Statistics on the problem of violence against women, including
 domestic violence, are unavailable. Human rights and women's
 rights groups in Latvia are aware of the issue but have not
 focused their efforts closely in this area.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Soviet labor law and practice were generally enforced in
 Latvia.. The Latvian branch of the U.S.S.R.'s All-Union Central
 Council of Trade Unions (AUCCTU), which disassociated itself
 from the All-Union body in Moscow in 1990 and renamed itself
 the Latvian Confederation of Free Trade Unions, has been
 supportive of Latvian independence. A smaller alternative
 Latvian Workers Union has also emerged, as well as independent
 unions of civil engineers and public sector workers. New
 Latvian legislation on trade unions and collective bargaining
 has been passed. Unions have the right to strike, with some
 limitations.
 At year's end, Latvia renewed its membership in the
 International Labor Organization. Unions, now free to
 affiliate internationally, are developing contacts with
 European trade unions.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 Under Soviet law, workers in Latvia did not have the right to
 organize outside the AACCTU, and free collective bargaining did
 not exist. Under the new legislation, about which the trade
 unions were consulted before it was passed, trade unions may
 now function independently of the managers of state-owned
 enterprises. However, collective bargaining is still in its
 formative stages. With the new freedom, the rate of
 unionization in Latvia has reportedly declined to 77 percent.
 Union organization in the private sector, now some 7 percent of
 the economy, is virtually nonexistent.
 There are no export processing zones.

 LATVIA
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Prior to the August coup attempt, compulsory labor was a
 feature of Soviet-administered prison camps; it has since been
 banned.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 The statutory minimum age for employment of children is 16.
 Minimum age and compulsory education laws are, by all accounts,
 enforced by state authorities through inspections.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 The Labor Code provides for a mandatory 40-hour maximum
 workweek, 4 weeks of annual vacation, and a program of
 assistance to working mothers with small children. The minimum
 wage is now set at a figure that is estimated by the Latvian
 authorities to be below the poverty line. Labor conditions in
 Latvia have been somewhat better than in the U.S.S.R. Wages in
 Latvia are significantly higher, and worker amenities are
 considered better, than in the U.S.S.R.
 Soviet and Latvian laws establish minimum occupational health
 and safety standards for the workplace. These standards seem
 to be ignored frequently.
