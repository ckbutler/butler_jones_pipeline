 CHILE
 Chilean democracy came under increasing strains from
 the 1950s onwards as the result of rapid growth in
 political participation, slow economic growth and endemic
 inflation.  In September 1973, as the result of severe
 economic dislocation and increasing violence broad opposition
 developed to the elected Allende government. The armed
 forces broke with their tradition of non-interference
 in politics and overthrew the government. The trauma
 of the Allende period (1970-73) and the view that his
 policies were leading to a Marxist state continue to
 influence the attitudes of many Chileans.
 Rather than returning power to civilians after the coup,
 the military, led by General Augusto Pinochet, embarked
 on a wide-ranging effort to change the Chilean political
 and economic systems. In the period 1973-77, the regime
 undertook to curb dissent through a series of repressive
 measures, unprecedented in contemporary Chilean history.
 These included mass arrests, torture, exile and the disap-
 pearance of hundreds of persons. This period also saw
 the banning of political parties, the suspension of labor
 rights, the closing of many newspapers and radio stations,
 and the purging of the educational system.
 There have been no confirmed "disappearances" since October
 1977. Arbitrary detention and cases of torture continued
 to occur in 1980 although there has been improvement
 since 1977 in the treatment of prisoners and general
 police procedures. Political parties remain formally
 dissolved, and basic freedoms of speech and assembly
 are restricted, although some political activity, criticism
 and limited press discussion is tolerated. Labor union
 activity continues to be under some restraints, but collective
 bargaining and the right to strike were restored, subject
 to new limitations by the 1979 labor law. The continuing
 "state of emergency," extended regularly every six months,
 gives the government extraordinary authority similar
 to that under a state of siege. The right to due process
 was weakened further in 1980. By means of decree laws,
 the government reinstituted executive-ordered internal
 exile for periods of up to three months; further, the
 authorized period of detention without formal charges
 was extended from five to twenty days in internal security
 law violations involving death, injury or kidnapping.
 In several instances, however, the courts and press have
 taken positions defending human rights.
 Following two years of relative calm, Chile suffered
 a moderate increase in extremist violence during 1980,
 including armed robberies, attacks and bombings in which
 three carabineros, an army officer and several innocent
 bystanders were killed. While increasingly active Movement
 of the Revolutionary Left (MIR) groups have claimed credit
 for some of these incidents, their involvement in others,
 particularly the assassination of an army officer in
 July, has not been established. A few MIR members have
 died in gun battles with police. Suspicions that rightist
 extremists are also active continue in the absence of
 any breakthroughs in solving these major cases. In July
 the government detained approximately 20 civilian police
 detectives, reportedly associated with a right-wing organiza-
 tion, in connection with a series of kidnappings in
 which some of the victims were tortured and a university
 student was beaten to death; the matter is now in the
 
 
 368
 hands of the civilian courts, but no charges have yet
 been brought for the death. Two have been charged for
 one of the kidnappings.
 With respect to socio-economic policy, the administration
 decided in 1975 to reduce the role of government, open
 the economy to world market competition and reform taxation.
 GNP growth has since averaged more than 7 percent per
 year in real terms, inflation has declined from over
 300 percent to about 30 percent, unemployment has declined
 gradually from just under 20 percent to about 10 percent
 and real wages have increased more than 80 percent.
 High growth rates and better tax collection have enabled
 the government to increase social spending both in real
 terms and by comparison with previous periods in Chilean
 history. Social spending is now targeted primarily at
 the poorest 20 to 25 percent of the population. An important
 effort in health and nutrition programs has cut the infant
 mortality rate in half from 1973 to 1979. The government
 has increased real spending at all levels of education,
 including university education, but has increased the
 percentage allocated to pre-primary, primary and intermediate
 levels in order to eliminate illiteracy.
 In September 1980, the government held a plebiscite seeking
 approval (by means of a simple yes or no vote) of a new
 constitution and political transition plan. The plan
 restores congressional elections in 1990 and regular
 presidential elections in 1997. In 1989 there will be
 another plebiscite on a junta-proposed candidate for
 president until 1997. The alternative to approval was
 continuance of the status quo. Approximately 93 percent
 of eligible voters cast ballots; 66 percent voted "yes",
 30 percent voted "no", 1 percent cast blank ballots and
 3 percent cast void ballots. Opposition leaders criticized
 the content and procedures of the plebiscite, arguing
 that it did not permit free debate or a meaningful choice,
 and that opponents did not have equitable access to the
 communications media. The new constitution is to take
 limited effect beginning in March 1981.
 1.   Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 The 1925 constitution forbids torture. Constitutional
 Act No. 3, issued in September 1976 to strengthen and
 perfect the rights recognized in the 1925 document, recognizes
 the right to life and integrity of the person and forbids
 the application of all illegal constraints. High-level
 government officials publicly and privately deny that
 the use of torture by government agents is authorized.
 Reports of torture declined from 1976 through early 1980.
 Since then, paralleling an increase in extremist violence,
 reported incidents of torture increased. At least 100
 incidents of torture were reported to human rights organiza-
 tions in 1980 -- with most individuals alleging psychological
 duress, beatings and the use of electric shock during
 interrogation by members of the National Information
 Center (CNI) or civilian police. While in some cases
 questions can be raised about the validity of the allegations,
 in other cases there is no apparent reason for the individuals
 to make false claims. According to such accounts torture
 was applied on the first or second day of detention to
 allow sufficient time for full recovery before release.
 
 
 369
 Local human rights organizations have expressed concern
 that the lengthening of the period of executive detention
 from five to 20 days in internal security law violations
 involving murder or kidnapping could facilitate more
 sustained physical abuse.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Human rights sources report that during the first ten
 months of 1980 the courts received 96 complaints of serious
 mistreatment including torture. Three men have died
 since November 1979 while in the custody of civilian
 police. Accounts by relatives suggest that physical
 abuse by police was the cause; the cases are under investiga-
 tion but no persons have been indicted. While a large
 percentage of detainees report correct treatment, some
 persons detained during peaceful demonstrations or otherwise
 picked up on suspicion of proscribed political activities,
 have complained of beatings and being forced to remain
 unclothed for extended periods of time. The living conditions
 of the various locations to which the government has
 ordered individuals into internal exile vary considerably.
 In prison, persons detained for political or terrorist
 activities are normally separated by cell blocks from
 common criminals. They are able to receive visits from,
 and communicate with, family, friends, legal counsel
 and representatives of the International Committee of
 the Red Cross (ICRC).
 c. Disappearances
 The last reported 'disappearances* occurred in 1977.
 About 635 cases from the period 1973-1977 remain unresolved.
 Although the Chilean supreme court appointed special
 judges in 1979 to investigate many of these disappearances,
 no one has been formally indicted. This year, the supreme
 court confirmed that the general amnesty declared in
 1978 applied to the policemen identified as having executed
 sixteen persons and deposited the bodies in a lime kiln
 at Lonquen in 1973.  The special judges are continuing
 investigations into some cases, have suspended action
 in numerous others, and have referred still others to
 military justice when the military or police are believed
 to have been involved. Some families of the disappeared
 have appealed the suspension or referral to the military
 courts. To date, the appeals have had little effect
 in resolving the whereabouts of their relatives.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 Although the government has denied holding political
 prisoners, there are more than 100 persons formally sentenced
 or in trial process for seditious activity. Most are
 accused of violating either the Internal Security Law
 or the Arms Control Law, or both. Some cases date from
 before the military takeover. In 1980 a few of those
 who had been sentenced were allowed to exchange prison
 for exile.
 People detained for participating in banned public demonstra-
 tions or illegal meetings are often held for the full
 five days permitted under executive discretion and then
 may be released (the large majority of cases), sent into
 internal exile, or charged with internal security violations.
 In those cases reaching the courts, the investigating
 
 
 370
 judges may take up to five more days to deliberate but,
 in practice, have rarely issued indictments.
 When people are detained, friends or relatives normally
 report the detentions, the press publicizes them and
 the government eventually acknowledges them. According
 to studies compiled by church human rights reports, a
 total of 729 persons were detained in Chile during the
 first six months of 1980. For the subsequent period
 of mid-July through mid-September, which included activities
 related to the September 11 plebiscite, about 350 detentions
 occurred -- including those individuals picked up and
 subsequently released within a matter of hours.
 In theory, the right of habeas corpus (writ of amparo)
 exists; however, in internal security cases the courts
 often do not act on such petitions in either a rigorous
 or timely manner. Based upon a recommendation by the
 church in May 1980, the supreme court in June 1980 instructed
 lower and military courts to issue more expeditious and
 rigorous rulings on these writs. State of emergency
 provisions authorize the president, or minister of interior
 acting in his behalf, to order the executive detention
 of persons without charge for up to five days. Under
 a new decree law, this period can be prolonged to twenty
 days in internal security investigations involving murder,
 kidnapping or other injury.   A few arrests not falling
 into this category have also resulted in detentions longer
 than five days. Civilian and military courts have another
 five days, from the time of arraignment, to decide whether
 to indict.
 Court investigations into the kidnappings and torture
 carried out in mid-1980 by civilian detectives, reportedly
 acting without authorization, have resulted in the indict-
 ments of two senior detectives, but only so far in relation
 to one of the women who was held. No one as yet has
 been charged in the kidnapping of the other persons,
 including the student who died from blows he received.
 The intelligence service (CNI) has only limited legal
 authority to arrest people on its own initiative; in
 practice, it has been able to obtain vaguely-worded warrants
 which provide considerable latitude in making searches
 or arrests. The public concern aroused by the unauthorized
 kidnappings by civilian police has led to greater care
 by security agents to identify themselves and to show
 warrants when detaining people.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Chile's civilian judges are career officials and most
 have served in the judiciary since before the present
 military government took power in 1973. Since 1978,
 most violations of the ban on political activity and
 most cases relating to alleged human rights abuses have
 been handled in the civilian court system. A decree
 law of February 1980 shifted first instance jurisdiction
 for the prosecution of proscribed political activities
 from the appellate courts to the regular lower level
 proceedings of the criminal courts.
 Civil court proceedings are conducted in accordance with
 Chile's civil code tradition. There is no trial by jury;
 reliance is placed on the written record. In the criminal
 courts of first instance, a judge serves multiple functions:
 as investigator, with the aid of the police or others;
 as prosecutor; as defense attorney, at times; and, ultimately,
 
 
 371
 as the one who decides the innocence or guilt of the
 accused. Criminal proceedings begin when the court of
 the accused receives a report of a crime, or a complaint
 by interested parties, or when the judge begins an investiga-
 tion. In the investigatory stage, the judge accumulates
 evidence in closed proceedings. The judge can either
 suspend the proceedings, in case of innocence,-or name
 the presumptively guilty party. When the latter occurs,
 the proceedings move to a second, more open, stage which
 allows for defense rebuttal. Once these activities have
 been completed, the judge issues a finding of innocence
 or guilt with appropriate punishment. These decisions
 may be appealed up to the supreme court.
 Criticisms of the functioning of civilian courts focus
 not on the procedures, but rather on the general unwilling-
 ness of judges to assert a vigorously independent role
 or, with rare exceptions, to effectively challenge the
 legality of actions by the executive under emergency
 powers. In cases involving alleged human rights abuses
 by uniformed personnel, civilian judges have frequently
 reached a determination that they lacked jurisdiction
 to proceed further. The Inter-American Human Rights
 Commission (IAHRC) reported in October 1980 that the
 rights to fair trial and of due process were subject
 to major significant restrictions -- principally because
 of the active role of the military courts in judicial
 proceedings and the failure of the civil courts to exercise
 their responsibilities on behalf of detained persons.
 Arms control violations go before a military prosecutor;
 he carries out the investigation and then makes recommenda-
 tions to a military judge, who issues the decision.
 Appeals may be made to a military court of two civilian
 judges and three professional military judges and, in
 the last resort, to the supreme court. Defendants have
 the rights of any Chilean citizen before the law, including
 the right to legal counsel. An April 1979 anti-terrorist
 decree law makes all members of an organization responsible
 for the acts of each member and establishes legal presumption
 of guilt in cases covered by the decree; it has not been
 invoked, however.
 f. Invasion of the Home
 The 1925 constitution and Constitutional Act. No. 3
 prohibit searches of the home and interception of private
 communications and documents except as determined by
 law. Provisions in the penal code require search warrants
 issued by either a judge or military prosecutor for specific
 locations. In practice, however, such searches are carried
 out under a general order issued by the judge or prosecutor.
 Human rights organizations report that legal formalities,
 such as the display of a warrant, have not been observed
 by the authorities in a number of searches.
 2.   Government Policies Relating to the Fulfillment
 of Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care
 and Education
 Government policy aims at a rapidly growing free enterprise
 oriented economy in which most workers have increased
 real income, and public welfare spending is focused,
 primarily on the poorest quarter of the population.,
 In response to the foreign exchange crisis and a continuing
 high level of inflation, the government introduced .a
 drastic austerity program in 1975. Also, copper prices
 declined by half between 1974 and 1975. The Chilean
 
 
 372
 economy underwent its worst depression since the 1930's,
 hurting Chileans in every economic stratum. According
 to most analyses, the greatest hardships were borne by
 the lowest income groups although in relative terms middle
 and upper income groups suffered a greater fall in net
 income. The depression bottomed out in early 1976.
 Since then the economy has expanded at historically unprece-
 dented rates.
 Major policy changes which have been introduced
 in the last five years include reducing tariffs in stages
 to their present basic level of 10 percent, establishing
 a realistic exchange rate, returning many small and medium-
 sized nationalized companies to the private sector, reducing
 or eliminating various price controls, special interest
 subsidies and regulatory mechanisms, reducing and then
 eliminating deficit spending and radically altering taxation
 by indexing corporate and individual taxation, eliminating
 capital gains tax, double taxation of dividends, and
 various loopholes and substituting the previous cascading
 sales tax with a value added tax. From 1976 to 1979
 real GDP growth averaged 8.3 percent per year -- more
 than twice the historical average. By 1977, GDP in real
 terms had begun to surpass previous peak levels. Real
 GDP growth is estimated at 6.0 percent in 1980, and per
 capita GDP should surpass      $1800. At the same time
 inflation has been brought down to 30 percent. Real
 wages increased 83 percent from 1976 through mid-1980.
 International reserves have accumulated to a net
 $2.4 billion.
 The unemployment rate, however, remains high at 10.2
 percent. It is down considerably from 19.6 percent reached
 in March 1976, at the bottom of the depression. The
 unemployment rate would be higher if it were not for
 the 5.1 percent of the labor force participating in the
 government's minimum employment program. This figure
 has more than doubled in the past year because of an
 eligibility liberalization which permits more than one
 member of a family to be enrolled in the program. The
 persistently high unemployment rate is attributable in
 part to the structural adjustments in the economy; there
 are also increased numbers of people, particularly women,
 in the labor force. A 1979 University of Chile study
 suggests that the poor have benefited proportionately
 more from the successes of Chilean economic policy.
 On either a personal or family income basis in the greater
 Santiago area, income of the most affluent 20 percent
 of the population has grown more slowly since 1976 than
 any other category while that of the poorest 20 percent
 has grown most rapidly. As a result, the degree of income
 concentration has declined since 1976 and is now approximately
 the same as at the start of the decade in 1970. Critics
 of the government's economic policies have argued that
 the income of the poor fell disproportionately between
 1974 and 1976 and that wealth remains highly concentrated.
 The government is attempting to make its social programs
 more effective by focusing its efforts on the poorest
 quarter of the population, considered to be in "extreme
 poverty." In late 1979, it established a social council
 of ministers to oversee a social coordination plan for
 fiscal expenditures on social welfare programs. The
 amount to be invested in 1980 is $2.64 billion, representing
 more than 50 percent of the total central government
 spending. This figure includes normal ministry budgeting
 in the social field and also a new $161 million emergency
 social fund intended for high-impact, high-visibility
 
 
 373
 anti-poverty projects. These government expenditures
 will amount to $238 per capita, the highest (in constant
 dollars) in Chilean history. As part of its administrative
 reform effort, the government issued in June legal guidelines
 for transferring administrative responsiblity for social
 services, including schools and health care facilities,
 to municipalities, while maintaining financial oversight.
 In education, the government has given increasingly greater
 funding support to pre-primary, primary and intermediate
 levels, relative to the university level in order to
 increase the country's 90 percent literacy rate (77 percent
 in rural areas).  During 1980, the government also instituted
 a new literacy campaign.
 Government health and nutrition programs have led to
 a reduction in the incidence of malnutrition in the officially
 reported infantile population (less than six years of
 age) from 15.5 percent in 1975 to 12 percent in 1979
 and in the incidence of advanced malnutrition from .7
 to .2 percent. There were similar declines in infant
 mortality (from 65.2 to 36.3 per thousand live births)
 and maternal mortality at childbirth (from 1.32 to .73
 thousand live births) from 1973 to 1979. Over the same
 period, the overall death rate per thousand fell from
 8.4 to 6.8, increasing average life expectancy from 64.2
 to 65.6 years.
 Social security expenditures in real terms have continued
 to increase. Regulations have been changed to eliminate
 discrimination against blue collar workers, and benefits
 have been extended to a wider segment of the population,
 including IO,000     indigent elderly and handicapped,
 not previously eligible. In addition, in late 1980 a
 new social security plan was begun under which employees
 would pay 17 percent of their salary toward their pensions
 and life and health insurance, firms would increase salaries
 of these employees by 18 percent, and the funds collected
 would be invested by private companies in a limited range
 of triple-A type securities and investments. The employees
 pension and insurance money is protected by the requirement
 that the investment companies must contribute from their
 capital if their earnings fall 7 percent below the industry
 average and, failing this, the absorption of the company
 by other companies and a government contribution to make
 up the shortfall. The plan decreases the overall cost
 to the employee by 9.7 percent and strengthens the social
 security system by investing the funds in earning assets.
 Critics of the social security reforms argue that this
 will reduce some benefits. It should be noted that workers
 may choose voluntarily between moving to the new system
 and remaining under their current plan.
 Public housing expenditures are small in comparison with
 evident needs. Although funding levels have risen since
 1978, they still amount to little more than half of peak
 levels in 1973. At the same time, programs have been
 overhauled to benefit the most needy rather than the
 middle class.   In addition to expenditure policy, the
 government has also been revising the tax structure in
 favor of lower income categories; in a recent change,
 it raised the percentage of taxpayers totally exempt
 from income tax liability from 38 to 66 percent. The
 main thrust of the economic policy in housing is to encourage
 the private sector to fill this need. In 1980 construction
 of a record 50,000 residential units were started.
 
 
 374
 The impact of government economic policies on lower income
 portions of the population remains a controversial issue
 in Chile. On the one hand, it is argued that the present
 economic policies have not brought down the high level
 of unemployment fast enough, and the unemployed are mostly
 low skilled and low income. On the other hand, it is
 argued that Chile's historically endemic inflation and
 hyperinflation of the early 1970's had the most severe
 impact on low income people so that the present reduction
 of inflation has helped the poor. While the present
 regime is making a determined effort to channel more
 resources to poorer sectors, there remains a tremendous
 breach between resources and needs. A recent World Bank
 report noted, moreover, that the government's policies
 were directed primarily to the urban poor and barely
 addressed the problem of rural poverty.
 According to statistics gathered by the University of
 Chile for the Santiago area (surveys have not been made
 for other regions), the proportion of income earning
 females over 14 years of age has been recovering from
 a sharp drop caused by the high unemployment of the mid-
 1970's.   Although still slightly below the level reached
 in the early 1970's, the employment figure for women
 has recovered more rapidly than that for male wage earners.
 Women currently constitute 28.5 percent of the work force.
 The education level of females appears to be improving
 more rapidly as well. The survey results for the Santiago
 area indicated that the proportion of females over 14
 years of age with better than primary education rose
 from 41 percent in 1970 to 51 percent in 1978. At the
 same time, the corresponding figures for males, though
 still higher, increased from 48 percent to 57 percent.
 Middle and upper class women generally have good access
 to education and entry-level professional jobs. Women
 do not occupy a proportional share of upper level decision
 making positions in the major institutions of government,
 business and academia. There are marked differences
 in the distribution of incomes for females in comparison
 with males. Among women, 28.8 percent (again, according
 to the Santiago survey) fell within the lowest income
 category and only 11.5 percent within the highest, whereas
 almost the reverse pertains to men. In the current govern-
 ment, there is one woman of cabinet rank and several
 just below the ministerial level. This past September,
 President Pinochet announced plans to establish a new
 ministry of the family, which will also address the concerns
 of women.
 Women wishing to travel abroad with minor children must
 have the father's written permission, even in the event
 that the courts have granted custody to the mother.
 On the other hand, a mother must obtain a court order
 to prevent the father from taking the children abroad.
 This disparate treatment is common in Latin America.
 3.   Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 A basic constitutional act decreed by the government
 in 1976 states that "any individual or group action is
 illegal and against the institutional order of the republic
 if such action is aimed at spreading doctrines which
 oppose the family, propose violence or a society based
 on class struggle; or which are against the constituted
 
 
 375
 regime or the integrity or function of the state of law."
 In curbing dissent, the government usually cites other
 more specific legal provisions and decrees outlawing
 Marxism and the advocacy of violent revolution.
 Virtually all public meetings require prior approval
 of the local military zone commander. In practice, permis-
 sion is regularly denied when the subject is politically
 sensitive.   Among exceptions, the government permitted
 a pre-plebiscite opposition rally attended by about 40,000
 in Santiago in August 1980, and ignored various smaller
 opposition meetings. Except during the pre-plebiscite
 period most demonstrators who met without authorization
 in 1980 were arrested and held for brief periods. The
 government charged some with violations of the internal
 security code but the courts did not find adequate basis
 for judicial action.
 A decree law of Pebrurary 1980 gave the government authority
 to internally banish persons for up to three months without
 charges, court review or the right of appeal. Previously,
 such action had been possible only under state of siege
 authority. Since the decree took effect, over 100 individuals
 have been internally exiled, some to remote towns far
 from their homes and families.
 The media are technically free from official prior censorship,
 but, in practice, the government informally tells publications
 and broadcasters when they are considered out of line.
 Thus, self-censorship is widely practiced, with most
 editors careful about the content of material prior to
 its release, although articles which are critical of
 the government appear regularly in several leading publica-
 tions. Under state of emergency authority, local military
 zone commanders can close down media, restrict coverage
 of internal security cases, forbid publicity of non-official
 activities of government officials, and prevent the sale
 or distribution of new publications. In one case this
 year, the Santiago zone commander prevented the distribution
 of a new book on the 1973 Lonquen killings, although
 dozens of articles and reports have been published in
 media on this subject. In another case, the zone commander
 prevented the start of a new magazine. The latter decision
 was reversed by an appeals court and then appealed by
 the government to the supreme court which upheld the
 zone commander.
 The government owns the only national television network.
 Other local or regional stations are operated by the
 universities, whose rectors are appointed by the government.
 While the directors of these TV stations have autonomy,
 they use considerable discretion. There are several
 periodicals and at least two radio stations critical
 of the regime; these give major voice to the opposition
 viewpoint and were very active in the period leading
 up to the plebiscite. "Non-Marxist" books and pamphlets
 critical of the government are permitted free circulation.
 In its 1979 annual report, the Inter-American Press Associa-
 tion noted improvements in press freedom in Chile, but
 concluded that restrictive laws, particularly  controlling
 new publications, resulted in a lack of full press freedom.
 Chile, predominantly a Catholic country, respects freedom
 of religion. A number of Protestant and other sects
 are active. The Jewish community reports full freedom
 and tolerance.
 
 
 376
 In 1979 the right to elect student government was restored
 at the universities. Rectors of the universities are
 military men. Vice Rectors are university professionals.
 Labor Unions
 Most trade union rights, suspended after the military
 takeover in 1973, were legalized again in July 1979 by
 the "Labor Plan" (a series of decree laws forming a labor
 code), or its subsequent technical additions and revisions
 although in a number of respects these rights are limited.
 The trade union movement had no practical input into
 the formulation of the labor plan.
 In general, even labor leaders favorable to the government
 and with access to high ranking officials have minimal
 influence on important labor matters. Opposition labor
 leaders have neither access nor influence and are occasionally
 subject to public attacks by government officials.
 Trade union organizations can normally elect their leaders
 instead of having them appointed by the government.
 In individual unions, however, elections are not obligatory,
 and there are some instances where appointed leaders
 have managed to hold off having elections despite rank
 and file sentiment to the contrary. As elections continue
 to be held, the number of appointed leaders are gradually
 decreasing.
 On some occasions the government has facilitated the
 formation and the smooth functioning of labor organizations
 favorable to it, while opposition labor organizations
 at times suffer bureaucratic and other forms of harassment.
 Collective bargaining has resumed for the large majority
 of workers -- albeit in a somewhat restricted fashion.
 Workers are guaranteed their existing wage and benefit
 package, plus any increase in consumer price index.
 Since the last adjustment (for the year up to July 1980),
 the average real increase was 7-8 percent. On the other
 hand, the scope of what can be bargained has been narrowed
 considerably to include only wages, benefits paid in
 cash or in kind, and certain comon conditions of employment,
 such as safety.
 Specifically excluded from collective bargaining are
 the civil service and the maritime sector; in the latter
 case, special presidential legislation is to be promulgated
 in the future to regulate that sector.
 Each year, the government publishes a list of those entities
 which can bargain collectively but are classified as
 "strategic." As such, they are prohibited from striking.
 Approximately thirty were listed in 1980. Most are public
 utilities and state-owned firms. For these companies,
 failure to reach agreement during negotiations leads
 to binding arbitration.
 For workers who can bargain collectively and can strike,
 the right to strike is limited in the sense that, after
 the 60th day of a strike, all striking workers are considered
 to have resigned their jobs, and they can be permanently
 replaced by the employer. Also legal for the the first
 time in Chile is management's ability to hire strikebreakers,
 an effective strike deterrent given the presently high
 unemployment rate.

 There is no grievance procedure system in Chile. The
 only recourse available to an aggrieved party is to appeal
 to the labor tribunals, a procedure which usually takes
 several months. Strikes cannot result from an individual
 grievance; they are only permitted in the case of a failed
 collective negotiation.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration and Repatriation
 Chileans are free to leave their country. Some one million
 Chileans live abroad, principally for economic reasons.
 Over half this number have resided for many years in
 Argentina (mainly Patagonia) where they provide the basic
 labor pool. In the judgment of international organizations
 dealing with refugees, the volume of skilled and unsilled
 workers returning to Chile now slightly exceeds the number
 leaving -- a reflection of the improvement in the Chilean
 economy.
 Many thousands fled Chile when the current government
 took power; hundreds sought asylum in foreign embassies,
 thousands were convicted of internal security violations
 and had jail sentences commuted to exile. The government
 was eventually willing to grant safe conduct passes to
 people who obtained asylum and wanted to leave Chile.
 Expulsions are no longer a regular practice by the government
 in dealing with opponents, although there was at least
 one instance in 1980 involving a prominent politician.
 Government decrees require those who are considered to
 have left Chile illegally to file a petition with a Chilean
 consul if they seek to return. The interior ministry
 reviews all petitions and rejects those from people who
 are considered to have engaged in anti-government activities
 abroad. The government has released no current figures
 on petitions received, rejected, approved or pending.
 In most cases the courts have upheld interior ministry
 decisions barring individuals from returning. In a small
 number of cases, the government has permitted some barred
 individuals to return, generally for short periods and
 on humanitarian grounds.
 Chile has accepted a few refugees in recent years and
 makes regular modest financial contributions to international
 organizations aiding refugees.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Political party activity is banned. In 1973, the government
 dissolved the Marxist parties and other parties forming
 the Unidad Popular Political Front. A 1977 decree law
 dissolved all remaining parties. There have been no
 elections for local or national political office since
 1973. There was universal suffrage in the September
 1980 constitutional plebiscite (voting is required by
 law), but without electoral registers or other safeguards
 acceptable to the opposition. Following the 1973 coup,
 the government assumed authority to amend the constitution.
 With congress dissolved, the junta exercises legislative
 powers, delegating executive authority to President Pinochet.
 Notwithstanding the formal ban on political activity,
 the non-Marxist parties, notably the Christian Democrats
 and some of the Radical Party offshoots, are able to
 continue to operate on a limited basis. Even some socialists
 and splinter leftist groups maneuver among themselves

 with tacit government acquiescence. Communists who are
 found engaging in political activites are generally detained
 for violating the internal security code or the 1973
 law prohibiting Marxist activity.
 4. Government Attitude and Record Regarding International
 and Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged
 Violations of Human Rights
 The government set a precedent when in July 1978 it allowed
 members of the special ad hoc working group of the United
 Nations Commission on Human Rights (UNHRC) to conduct
 a long-delayed visit to Chile. Although the groups subse-
 quently disbanded, a special rapporteur was tasked to
 submit Chile human rights reports to the commission and
 the U.N. General Assembly (UNGA). The Chilean government
 communicated officially to UN authorities in March and
 May of 1979 its objection to, and refusal to cooperate
 with, continuing special consideration of Chile by ad
 hoc procedures, such as the use of a rapporteur, contending
 that these measures had no legal or moral force.
 A Chile item appears each year on the agenda'of the UNGA
 and the UNHRC. The 1980 UNGA resolution expressed "particular
 concern that the Chilean authorities have failed to take
 and urge effective measures, as requested in its resolution
 33/175, to investigate and clarify the fate of persons
 reported to have disappeared for political reasons",
 and urging the authorities of Chile to respect and promote
 human rights in accordance with the responsibilities
 it has undertaken under various international instruments.
 The Inter-American Human Rights Commission also maintains
 a watching brief on the Chilean situation. In its October
 1980 report on human rights in Latin America it stated
 that "There have been violations of the right to life
 and personal security in Chile" and that severe restrictions
 on the exercise of other rights embodied in the American
 Declaration of the Rights and Duties of Man continue.
 In late 1978, the ICRC reduced its Chilean presence to
 one local employee primarily because of the substantial
 decline in the number of political prisoners. Earlier
 it had played an active role in prison visits in attempts
 to locate missing persons. The Intergovernmental Committee
 for European Migration (ICEM) also has been active in
 Chile, conducting a program permitting convicted political
 prisoners an opportunity to serve out their sentences
 in exile. The government cooperated in making this program
 possible. Counting all categories of refugees, ICEM
 has moved some 20,000 people out of Chile since the coup.
 Amnesty International, the International Commission of
 Jurists and other non-governmental organizations have
 expressed special concern over Chile. During 1980, the
 first two organizations issued reports alleging a relative
 increase in human rights violations in Chile and criticizing
 the courts for their ineffectiveness in protecting the
 rights of detainees or people who have disappeared.
 Although the government believes that the reports produced
 by these organizations exaggerate the scope and volume
 of abuses, it has permitted visits by their representatives.
 The Catholic Church, along with the representatives of
 several other religious communities, has taken the lead
 in defending human rights and implementing social action
 programs. This has resulted in visible tensions between
 the government and the church, and disagreement over
 the church position by more conservative Catholics.
 
 
 379
 In a number of instances, church property has been the
 target of attacks darried out by assailants who have
 not been identified or apprehended.
 The Chilean Commission for Human Rights, now two years
 old, has also publicized abuses and spoken out strongly
 against them. It and the other human rights groups operate
 openly, albeit cautiously, in Chile; some of their members
 have experienced harassment in the form of arrests and
 searches.
 The Chilean government has failed to investigate fully
 and prosecute three former security officers indicted
 in the U.S. for complicity in the 1976 assassinations
 of ex-Chilean Ambassador to the U.S. Orlando Letelier
 and a U.S. citizen, Ronni Moffitt. In October 1979 the
 Chilean supreme court denied a U.S. government extradition
 request for the three officers.
