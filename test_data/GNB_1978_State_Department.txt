 GUINEA-BISSAU
 Guinea-Bissau is a single-party state whose Constitution
 guarantees those fundamental rights set down in the
 Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The Government
 of Guinea-Bissau appears committed to upholding the
 human rights guarantees outlined in the Constitution
 and it does not sanction violations. The Government of
 Guinea-Bissau's origin as an army of independence
 seeking expulsion of the Portuguese is reflected in
 occasional overzealous actions by the state security
 apparatus, however. The absence of internal or
 external politibal threats to the Government creates an
 atmosphere conducive to respect for human rights.
 1.   Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a.   Torture
 Freedom from torture and inhuman punishment are among
 the fundamental guarantees of the Universal Declaration
 of Human Rights. As Guinea-Bissau's Constitution
 guarantees these fundamental rights, freedom from
 torture is respected and there are no reports of-such
 practices in Guinea-Bissau.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Freedom from such practices is legally protected, as
 the Constitution guarantees those rights in the Universal
 Declaration of Human Rights (see a above). The Department
 of State has no reports of such practices in Guinea-Bissau.
 c.   Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 The Constitution guarantees freedom from detention
 or arrest except under law. However, the Constitution
 also contains a provision which can be used to deny
 
 
 8o
 rights and liberties to those who "encourage colonialism,
 imperialism, racism, or tribalism." While we have no
 precise estimate of the number of persons serving
 sentences for political offenses, it is thought to be
 small.
 d.   Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The right to a defense in a criminal trial is recognized
 and guaranteed to the accused by the Constitution. In
 the immediate aftermath of independence, several
 individuals arrested for political offenses did not
 receive public trials. In recent years, however, there
 have been no reported instances of defendants being
 denied fair public trials.
 e.   Invasion of the Home
 The Constitution guarantees the inviolability of
 domicile, and this guarantee is respected in practice.
 2.   Governmental Policies Relating to the Fulfillment
 of Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care
 and Education
 Guinea-Bissau -- an underdeveloped, agrarian state --
 is currently under serious economic pressures.
 The transition to independence from Portugal was
 accompanied by severe economic dislocation when most
 skilled and trained personnel departed and many private
 business enterprises were abandoned. The Government
 is currently trying to fill the gap.
 A severe year-long drought exacerbated the economic
 situation, and during 1978 resources which might have
 been devoted to economic development were diverted
 to meet the immediate crisis. In June 1978 it was
 estimated that one half or more of food crops had been
 lost and perhaps the same proportion of livestock.
 The Government has received sizable foreign aid
 and loans to bolster the economy, particularly during
 the drought. Nevertheless, agricultural development is
 
 
 81
 the Government's top priority and the eventual achievement
 of agricultural self-sufficiency remains a policy
 objective. Guinea-Bissau has applied for membership in
 the Permanent Interstate Committee for Drought Control
 in the Sahel (CILSS).
 Although twelve percent of the national budget is allocated
 to health and social welfare, the country remains
 dependent on donations of medicine to meet national
 needs.
 The Government of Guinea-Bissau plans to decentralize
 some economic programs at the regional level. This
 modification of a planned economy is designed to permit
 greater responsiveness to local conditions, promote
 rural development and thus fulfill basic human needs.
 Given its birth as an independence movement in the
 rural areas, the Government of Guinea-Bissau has given
 particular attention to the rural poor and improvement
 of their living standards. So far, implementation of
 the decentralization has been on piecemeal basis, but
 local participation in the planning process is effective.
 3.   Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Includ-
 ing:
 a.   Freedom of Thought, Speech, Press, Religion
 and Assembly
 Freedom of expression, thought, assembly, petititon
 and religion is guaranteed by the Constitution and
 is generally respected, subject to overriding considera-
 tions of state security. However, organized criticism
 of or opposition to the current Government and party
 are not permitted.
 Guinea-Bissau's media is controlled by the Government.
 A mass trade union organization, the Uniao Nacional de
 Trabalhadores (UNTG), is being created under government
 auspices; about one-half of the nation's 4,000 salaried
 workers are members. Political party ideology and the
 Constitution recognize full equality of all citizens,
 and women actively participate in the Government
 and economy of Guinea-Bissau.
 
 
 b.   Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel and Emigration
 Foreign travel is limited except to neighboring
 countries because of difficulties in obtaining hard
 currency. Exit visas for citizens and foreign residents
 wishing to travel abroad are required and are sometimes
 difficult to obtain. The Department of State knows of
 no bars to emigration.
 c.   Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Guinea-Bissau is a single-party state and the ruling
 party for both Guinea-Bissau and Cape Verde is the
 African Party for the Independence of Guinea-Bissau
 and Cape Verde (PAIGC). Opposition parties are not
 permitted. Any citizen over fifteen years of age has the
 right to vote. Non-party members are eligible for
 elected or appointed office. In practice, office
 holders have usually joined the Party after election or
 appointment to Government positions. Intra-party
 debate has so far been controlled by internal discipline.
 The overwhelming weight of the organizational structure
 has prevented disagreements which arise from becoming
 public.
 The Popular National Assembly of Guinea-Bissau does not
 appear to have an active role in the Guinea-Bissau
 political system, although it does have the power to
 propose laws and make recommendations to the Government.
 Its essential functions are apparently that of a
 ratifying body and communication channel back to the
 general population. Assembly Deputies are not popularly
 elected, although the Constitution provides for eventual
 direct election. At present, they are selected by the
 directly elected Regional Councils and must be approved
 by the ruling party.
 As regards the youth of the country, the Party goal is
 to organize and mobilize it through two organizations:
 the Juventude Africana Amilcar Cabral (JAAC), which
 enrolls children ten to fifteen years of age, and
 the Pioneers, age fifteen to 25. The Party seeks to
 create and maintain youth organizations to train
 
 
 83
 the young for the task of building the society envisioned
 by Party ideology. Both groups are patterned on the
 PAIGC's organizational structure and are active in both
 Guinea-Bissau and Cape Verde.
 4.   Government Attitude and Record Regarding Inter-
 national and Non-governmental Investigation of
 Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 To the knowledge of the Department of State no such
 investigations have been sought. Guinea-Bissau's
 response to any requests in the future would depend on
 the nature of the allegations and the reputation of the
 organization requesting the investigation.
