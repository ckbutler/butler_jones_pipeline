 MOROCCO
 The Constitution of Morocco provides for a constitutional monarchy with aplural-
 istic political system, a representative Parliament, and an independent judiciary.
 Recent changes to the Constitution ostensibly increase the power of the Prime Min-
 ister and Parliament relative to the Crown. In practice, however, ultimate authority
 rests with the Kin, who retains the discretion both to dismiss ministers and to dis-
 solve Parliament in order to rule by decree. Two-stago parliamentary elections in
 1993 produced gains for opposition parties in the first stage which were reversed,
 amid credible reports of government manipulation, in the second stage.
 The security apparatus comprises several overlapping police and paramilitary or-
 ganizations whose activities are coordinated by the national government. The Direc-
 tion de ia Surveillance du Territoire (DST), Surete Nationale, and judicial police are
 under the Ministry of Interior, while the Gendarmerie Royale reports directly to the
 Palace. Security forces continued to commit human rights abuses, including torture.
 Evidence was released, in the notorious "Tabit affair, showing that senior Surete
 Nationale officers had systematically abused hundreds of women over several years.
 (Several officials were tried and convicted, while Tabit himself was executedl-s
 Section 1.c.).
 Morocco has a mixed economy based largely on agculture, fishing, light industry,
 phosphate mining, tourism, and remittances from Moroccans working abroad. An il-
 egald dg trade also is a significant factor. Since the early 1980s, Morocco has pur-
 sued an economic reform program that has contributed to generally strngeconomic
 Gr    and low inflation, although these developments have been set back by a
 drought now in its second year. The Government recently launched a program of
 privatizing state-owned enterprises.

 The Government of Morocco took several steps in 1993 to address human rights
 concerns, including establishing a Deputy Minister for Human Rights, ratifying sev-
 eral international conventions on human rights, and amending laws on polygamy,
 divorce and spousal support to mandate more favorable treatment of women. The
 Royal Consultative Council on Human Rights (CCDH) formed working grou ps to in-
 vestigate various areas of human rights concerns, opened dialogs with domestic
 human rights groups, and recommended to the King that government ministries be-
 come more responsive to inquiries about possible human rights abuses. Closer scru-
 tiny, however, reveals many of these steps to be cosmetic. Credible reports of rou-
 tine abuse of prisoners continued unabated, and at least three deaths in custody can
 reasonably be attributed to torture. Freedom of speech and press continued to be
 restricted, especially in cases perceived to affect the security of the State. Other
 principal problems included limitations on the right of citizens to change their gov-
 ernment, arbitrary arrest and detention, a weak and malleable judiciary, and re-
 strictions on the freedoms of travel, assembly and association, and religion, and ad-
 ditional constraints on women's rights.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extra judicial Killing.--Credible reports document that at
 least three persons died in police custody in 1993 due to Moroccan security force
 brutality. The most publicized police brutality case involved the death on May 16
 of Mustapha Hamzaoui in the jail at Khenifra. Hamzaoui, a former law student and
 activist with the left-wing Moroccan Association of Unemployed Graduates, was ar-
 rested on May 15 on suspicion of verbally assaulting four young women. According
 to Khenifra authorities, he was interrogated twice while in custody and then com-
 mitted suicide by hanging. Alleging that the body bore evidence of multiple cigarette
 burns and mutilated genitalia, Hamzaoui's family refused to accept his remains
 without the performance of an autopsy. Although the Ministry of Justice sent a phy-
 sician to examine the body, no autopsy report was made public. Khenifra authorities
 subsequently released a statement confirming the finding of suicide and impugning
 Hamzaoui's character. Despite appeals and a legal motion filed by the OMDH, no
 further government investigation or response has been made. Hamzaoui's family is
 reportedly under government pressure to drop the matter.
 In another case, Abdellah Bentawet died while in detention in a Tangier jail. He
 was arrested on June 1 after being involved in an altercation. Members of his family
 allege that, while they were visiting the detainee, a security agent began to beat
 him and demanded payment of approximately $16 for his release, which the family
 refused to make. On the following day, Bentawet's family was informed that he had
 committed suicide. Moroccan authorities have not responded to repeated requests by
 human rights organizations for an investigation.
 In a third case, Mounir Azzag, a 22 year-old Tangier resident was arrested on Oc-
 tober 9 after an argument with police about a parking infraction. On October 11,
 his family was notified that he had committed suicide while in custody. Called to
 the morgue, his family reported that the body bore a large facial cut and that the
 authorities refused to allow them to view the entire body. An autopsy ordered by
 local authorities found no indications of violence yet concluded that death was
 caused by hanging.
 The police involved in the Hamzaoui, Bentawet, and Azzag deaths were all em-
 ployed by the Ministry of the Interior. No disciplinary actions have been instituted
 against them.
 b. Disappearance. -There were no reported permanent disappearances in 1993.
 Tempr   "disappearances" continued to result from the practice of holding persons
 in pretrial incommunicado detention, without notifying families or attorneys, for
 longer than the legal limit of 48 hours.
 In May the Moroccan Human Rights Organization (OMDH) published a list of 24
 persons who disappeared between 1973 and 1987, most after arrest or conviction on
 charges related to political activity. OMDH's requests to the Ministries of Justice
 and Interior for information regaring the welfare and whereabouts of these persons
 have gone unanswered. Other human rights organizations have published much
 higher estimates of the number of persons who have permanently disappeared after
 last being seen in the custody of Moroccan security forces. The Government has
 never acknowledged any such cases, including the 300 Sahrawis (native Saharans)
 released without comment in 1991 after detention for up to 15 years. As one of
 many examples, repeated appeals to Moroccan authorities for information regarding
 the fate of Abdelhaq Rouissi, a trade unionist who disappeared after his arrest 29
 years ago, have been met either with silence or summary dismissal.
 
 
 1251
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Although the Government ratified the Convention Against Torture in June, credible
 reports persist of security force involvement in physical abuse, including torture and
 degrading treatment, of detainees. Disinterested former prisoners reported that de-
 tainees suspected of politically motivated crimes were more likely than other detain-
 ees to be subjected to physical abuse. Harsh treatment reportedly continued after
 conviction, with guards subjecting prisoners to random violence and deliberately de-
 priving them of family visits, sleep, baths, blankets, medical care, food, and access
 to stu. y materials. There were no reports that torturers were held accountable for
 their actions in 1993. Moreover, although they have the power to do so, prosecutors
 appear reluctant to order medical examination in cases where torture is alleged.
 The arrest and conviction in 1993 of a senior Surete Nationale official revealed
 a disturbing record of systematic rape and assault of women. One official, Moham-
 med Tabit, was found guilty on hundreds of charges of rape and assault perpetrated
 over a period of several years during which he served in various posts within the
 Surete Nationale, including as Commissioner of a Casablanca precinct. Under pre-
 tense of police business, Tabit typically would lure his victims to a Casablanca
 apartment where he would assault them while videotaping his activities. He was
 assisted in his crimes by several Surete Nationale officials. Tabit himself was exe-
 cuted. In addition to those who were convicted in connection with the affair, several
 high ranking government officials were removed without comment. The press held
 those personnel changes to be indicative of widespread knowledge within the Gov-
 ernment of Tabit's activities throughout his career.
 Prison conditions in Morocco are harsh. At least 15 persons died in prisons in
 1993 due either to illnesses contracted as a result of unhealthy prison conditions
 or lack of medical care for preexisting illnesses. Inmate hunger strikes to protest
 prison conditions, especially by Islamist inmates (i.e., prisoners whose crimes were
 motivated by pursuit of the doctrines of political Islam, have become commonplace.
 Three prisoners died in a 2-week period in a single prison in Casablanca, each
 within days of beginning a short sentence for a minor crime. There is no evidence
 to establish overt security force involvement in these deaths, which appeared to re-
 sult from a lack of basic medical care, sanitation and nutrition. Acknowledging the
 substandard conditions in Moroccan prisons, CCDH has established a working
 group to recommend improvements. However, the Government, citing economic con-
 straints, continued in 1993 to decline to invest significant resources to improve
 penal living conditions.
 Earlier reports of the closing and destruction of the Tazmamart detention facility,
 notorious for its harsh treatment of prisoners have not been verified. After years
 of denials, King Hassan acknowledged for the Arst time in a May interview that the
 facility had existed. However, the Government refused to comment on past or
 present activities at the Tazmamart site or to provide an accountinof the prisoners
 who were confined there, many of whom apparently died there.    e few surviving
 prisoners who were released from Tazmamart have indicated that their continued
 iberty is conditioned upon their silence regarding the circumstances of their impris-
 onment. There is no indication that the Government is investigating Tazmamart
 abuses for the purpose of bringing those responsible to justice.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Legal guarantees of procedural due proc-
 ess in Morocco, extensively revised in recent years, are frequently ignored. Arrests
 usually take place in public, but police sometimes refuse to identify themselves.
 Warrants are not always used. The law requires that a detainee be brought before
 a judge within 48 hours of detention (extendable to 96 hours upon approval of the
 prosecutor) and informed of the charges against him. Under the reviseddue process
 rules, incommunicado (garde a vue) detention is limited to 48 hours, with a one-time
 24-hour extension upon request by the prosectr. An accused person must be
 brought to trial within 2 months of arrest, with up to five extensions of 2 months
 each allowed at the discretion of the prosecutor. Detainees are denied counsel dur-
 ing the initial period of detention when torture is most likely to take place. Counsel
 is allowed only as of the first cross-examination, and many cases are resolved with-
 out cross-examination.
 According to Moroccan human rights groups, compliance with the new due process
 rules has been irregular. Some members of the security forces, long used to indefi-
 nite precharge access to detainees, continue to resist the new rules. Lawyers are
 sometimes not informed as to the date of detention and are thus unable to monitor
 tarde a vue detention limits. However, there were no known instances in 1993 of
 e once common practice of indefinite incommunicado detention.
 Moroccan law creates a limited system of bail that is rarely used, although de-
 fendants are sometimes released on their own recognizance. The law does not pro-
 vide for habeas corpus or its equivalent.
 
 
 1252
 Under a separate Code of Military Justice, military authorities may detain mem-
 bers of the military without warrants or public trial.
 Abdessalem Yassine, leader of the banned Islamist organization Justice and Char-
 ity, remained under house arrest in his home after 2 years of detention without
 trial. His family members ar only occasionally allowed to visit him. No other visits
 are allowed. Indicative of its subordination to the Ministry of the Interior CCDH
 has not publicly questioned the propriety of the Ministry's confinement of Yassine.
 There are no known instances of Moroccans being sentenced to exile.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Tria!.-Morco has a dual legal system- a secular system
 based in part on French legal tradition and a parallel islamic system which adju-
 dicates family matters and inheritance law for Moroccan Muslims. The secular sys-
 tem includes courts of original jurisdiction, appellate courts and a Supreme Court.
 Judges in this system are university-trained attorneys who iave undergone further
 specialized training prior to assuming theirpositions.
 Political and security offenses are not distinguished from common criminal of-
 fenses under Moroccan law. All criminal matters are tried in the secular courts. In
 general, cases are brought before a court of first instance which may call for a hear-
 ing quickly to bring cases to trial. The detainee is informed of charges and ques-
 tioned by the judge who decides if the charges have merit. If the infraction is minor
 and not contested, the judge may release the detainee or impose a light sentence.
 If a lengthy investigation is required, the judge may release detainees on their own
 recognizance. Criminal cases are frequently resolved by confessions. Disinterested
 former prisoners continued to report attempts by authorities to extract confessions
 under duress.
 The Islamic court system consists only of trial courts, and their decisions may not
 be appealed. Although judges in this system are clerics who traditionally were not
 trained in the law, judges named to the bench in recent years have been formally
 educated in Islamic law. Cases are decided on the basis of the Koran or the deriva-
 tive Shari'a and are often tried without attorneys.
 Both the secular and Islamic courts are susceptible to extrajudicial pressures. Sec-
 ular court judges are not well paid. Cash payments to unscrupulous judges are
 widely reported to be commonplace in routine criminal cases. Likewise, judges hear-
 ing cases involving challenges to royal authority or state policy are vulnerable to
 political pressure, especially from the Ministry of Interior. The accused in such cases
 do not enjoy the procedural safeguards needed to ensure a fair trial. Comments
 made by the prosecutor during the Tabit trial, for example, clearly indicated that
 the sitting judge was following instructions from the Ministry of the Interior and
 the Palace. Islamic court judges are paid by the parties for services in settling inher-
 itance cases, with compensation often a percentage of the assets involved.
 Aside from external pressures, the secular court system is also subject to resource
 constraints. Consequently, criminal defendants charged with less serious offenses
 often receive only cursory hearings, with judges relying on police reports to render
 decisions. Although the Government provides an attorney at public expense for seri-
 ous crimes (when the alleged offense carries a maximum sentence of over 5 years),
 appointed attorneys often provide inadequate representation.
 Proceedings in the cases of three labor leaders convicted of expressing
 antigovernment views were concluded in 1993. In May the Court of Appeal upheld
 the conviction of Noubir Amaoui who was sentenced in 1992 to 2 years in prison
 for defaming the Government after a trial widely criticized for being politically moti-
 vated and for procedural irregularities and restrictions on public and press access.
 In July Amaoui was granted a royal pardon and released. Driss Laghnimi was con-
 victed in 1993 for insulting the person of the King during a public discussion be-
 tween members of different unions. He also received a royal pardon following denial
 of his appeal in April. The Court of Appeal also upheld the conviction of Ahmed
 Belaichi who was sentenced in 1992 to 3 years in prison for "affront to the military"
 after a trial in which several defense witnesses were not permitted to testify. He
 remains in prison.
 Moroccan human rights organizations periodically publish lists of prisoners "of
 opinion," prisoners accused of armed conspiracy or violence for political reasons, and
 prisoners convicted following demonstrations or strikes. These groups estimate that
 Moroccan prisons now hold 500 to 600 prisoners in these categories, of whom ap-
 proximately 100 are held for crimes of politically motivated violence, and approxi-
 mately 300 were arrested in connection with strike or demonstration activities. Be-
 cause the Government defines several categories of speech as criminal (see Section
 2.a.), it regardspolitical prisoners as common criminals.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution states that the home is inviolable and that no search or investigation
 may take place without a search warrant issued in compliance with the law. Cur-
 
 
 1253
 rent law stipulates that a search warrant may be issued by a prosecutor on good
 cause. This stipulation is not always observed, however, and there continue to be
 reports of illegal searches of the homes and offices of suspected political activists.
 Government security services, generally operating under the direction of the Min-
 istry of the Interior, selectively monitor certain persons and organizations, both for-
 eign and Moroccan, including their telephones and mail. University campuses are
 under close surveillance, and there is an extensive informant system, especially on
 campuses and in cities.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of expres-
 sion, but by Moroccan law and tradition negative commentary is forbidden on three
 topics: the monarchy, Morocco's claim to the Western Sahara, and the sanctity of
 Islam. Statements on these subjects may be deemed crimes against state security.
 In addition, many Moroccans are careful not to criticize the foreign or domestic poli-
 cies of the Government for fear of reprisal.
 Mustapha Dadao, a Marrakech student arrested in 1992 for allegedly shouting of-
 fensive slogans at a May Day rally, was convicted in January of "insult to the King"
 and sentenced to 5 years. A year was added to his sentence when he commented
 that his trial had been "superficial." Fifteen Oujda students were convicted in Janu-
 ary of "illegal demonstrations and distribution of untruthful tracts susceptible of
 disturbing the public order" anid received sentences ranging from 1 month to 1 year.
 In March two students received 2-nionth sentences for protesting against a new ex-
 amination schedule. In June five Khenifra youths received 3-month sentences for
 holding a demonstration protesting the death in detention of Mustapha Hamzaoui.
 (See Section L.a.)
 Press freedom is significantly restricted, though the limits are not clearly defined.
 A 1958 decree gives the Government the authority to register and license domestic
 newspapers and journals. In practice, authorities use the licensing process to pre-
 vent the publication of materials that they believe cross the threshold of tolerable
 dissent. Offending publications may be declared a danger to state security and may
 be seized; the publisher's license may be suspended and equipment destroyed. Arti-
 cle 55 of the Press Code empowers the Government to censor newspapers directly
 by ordering them not to report on specific items or events.
 The Government tolerates satirical and often stinging editorials in the opposition
 parties' dailies. The tone of those editorials became especially sharp during the 1993
 election campaigns. The press also continued in 1993 to report allegations of torture
 and other harsh treatment, abuse of authority, and prisoners' complaints of degrad-
 ing conditions. In particular, the flagrant abuses perpetrated by Casablanca police
 officers revealed during the Tabit trial were widely reported. In November the oppo-
 sition news daily L'Opinion ran a series of editorials critical of the state of democ-
 racy in Morocco. The paper's editor was sur:moned to the office of the Minister of
 Interior. The paper therafer ran an open letter to the Minister condemning his
 alleged threat to imprison the editor. Other opposition papers have subsequently
 editorialized in support of L'Opinion's stance against the Minister.
 Government control of the media generally is exercised through directives and
 "guidance" bulletins from the Ministry of Interior. The media regularly engages in
 self- censorship, prompted by a desire to avoid the Government's attention and lp-as-
 sible sanctions. The Government owns the official press agency, Maghreb Arab
 Press, and the Arabic daily Al Anbaa.
 The Government owns the only television station receivable nationwide without
 cable or satellite dish antennas. Dish antennas are available, though expensive, and
 permit free access to a wide variety of foreign broadcasts. Morocco's sole private sta-
 tion can be seen in most urban areas with the rental of an inexpensive decoder.
 Northern residents can receive Spanish stations with standard antennas. The Gov-
 ernment does not impede reception of foreign broadcasts.
 A great number of foreign news publications are available, particularly from Eu-
 rope and the United States. Although generally tolerating a broad spectrum of opin-
 ion in the foreign press distributedin Morocco, the Government continued in 1993
 to ban those editions of foreign publications that contained articles about Morocco
 deemed particularly offensive. F or example, distribution of the February 6 and
 March 29 editions of Ie Monde were blocked apparently because they contained ar-
 ticles describing efforts of a major Moroccan compdnto acquire a foreign radio sta-
 tion, offering an unflattering appraisal of Moroccan- renc relations, and question-
 ing the fairness of the Moroccan elections. Moroccan authorities searched the hotel
 room of a British journalist, who waspreparing a story on the Tabit trial, ques-
 tioned her regarding her activities, andlater confiscated her notes at the airport.
 
 
 1254
 Moroccan universities enjoy relative academic freedom in most areas, but the Gov-
 ernment prohibits academic investigation of the Islamic roots of the monarchy. Lim-
 ited research and publishing on Islam and Islamic fundamentalism is tolerated.
 Ministry of Interior approval is a prerequisite to tenure in all disciplines. Professors
 complain that the Ministry often confers tenure on political, rather than purely aca-
 demic grounds.
 b. Pr:edom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-Although the the Constitution
 provides for freedom of assembly and association, this right is significantly limited
 by three decrees, dating from 1935, 1939, and 1958, which permit the Government
 to suppress even peaceful demonstrations and mass gatherings. Several groups were
 subjet to government restraints on speech in 1993. In the aftermath of the Tabit
 affai  9 Moroccan women's groups organized a march in Rabat against sexual har-
 assment. It was to be the first of its kind in Morocco and was expected to draw
 thousands of participants. Without explanation, the Government denied permission
 for the march.
 Authorities broke up a variety of peaceful demonstrations in 1993, often injuring
 and arresting the participants. In April a sit-in organized by the Moroccan National
 Association of Unemployed Graduates to call attention to the lack of employment
 available to recent graduates was forcibly dispersed by authorities. In June a sit-
 in organized by a group of blind students to publicize their ineligibility for unem-
 ployment compensation was similarly disrupted by authorities. In November several
 members of this group were injured or arrested when police forcibly broke up an-
 other demonstration in front of the Ministry of the Interior. The Government contin-
 ued to impede the ability of human rights groups to hold public meetings, often by
 denying necessary permits.
 Another effective restraint on assembly rights is imposed by the Government's
 practice of closing mosques to the public shortly after religious services, thereby re-
 moving any potential for the practice, common in other Muslim countries, of using
 mosque premises for political activity.
 The right to form organizations is limited. Under a 1958 decree, persons wishing
 to create an organization must obtain the approval of the Ministry of the Interior
 before holding meetings. In practice, the Ministry uses this requirement to prevent
 persons suspected of advocating causes opposed by the Government from forming
 legal organizations. Islamist and leftist groups have the greatest difficulty in obtain-
 ing official sanction. Twenty-nine Islamist groups have een active within Morocco.
 Membership in two of these groups, Justice and Charity and Jama'a Islamia, has
 been outlawed due to perceived antimonarchy rhetoric. Political parties must also
 be approved by the Ministry of the Interior, which uses this power" to control partici-
 pation in the political process.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-Islam is the official religion of Morocco. Ninety-nine per-
 cent of Moroccans are Sunni Muslims, and the King bears the title "Commander of
 the Faithful." The Jewish community of approximately 7,000 is permitted to practice
 its faith, as is the somewhat larger foreign Christian community. Members of these
 religions are legally forbidden to proselytize, although several dozen evangelical
 missionaries conduct services and bible meetings which are attended by some Mo-
 roccan Muslims.
 Although the Constitution provides for freedom of worship, only Islam, Christian-
 ity, and Judaism are tolerated in practice. The King has pronounced all other reli-
 gions to be heresies. The Baha'i community of 150-200 people has been forbidden
 to meet or hold communal activities since 1983. According to Islamic law and tradi-
 tion, conversion of any kind from Islam is strictly prohibited and any attempt to
 induce a Muslim to convert is punishable by imprisonment. In October Mustapha
 Zraamda, a Moroccan Muslim, was sentenced to 3 years in prison after he refused
 to discontinue correspondence with the directors of a Christian radio progm broad-
 cast to North Africa from France. A Brazilian missionary who hosted bible meetings
 attended by Zmamda was fired from his teaching position, reportedly after the Min-
 istry of the Interior threatened to revoke the operating license of his employer un-
 less he was dismissed.
 The Goverument monitors Friday mosque sermons and the curriculum of Koranic
 schools to insure that approved doctrines are taught. Fundamentalist Islamic activi-
 ties are sometimes repressed but are largely tolerated so long as they remain re-
 stricted to the propagation of Islam and educational and charitable activities.
 Islamist groups that question the King's status as Commander of the Faithful and
 those that engage in violence are suppressed.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-Although freedom of movement within Morocco is provided for in the
 Constitution, in practice security forces set up roadblocks throughout the country
 and stop traffic at will. In some regions the roadblocks have been maintained in the
 
 
 1255
 
 same places for years, creating what some characterize as internal frontiers. In the
 Western Sahara, which is administered by Morocco, movement is restricted in areas
 regarded as militarily sensitive.
 The Interior Ministry restricts the freedom to travel outside Morocco in certain
 circumstances. For example, it has refused to issue passports to a number of Moroc-
 cans, including certain political activists, former political prisoners, and Baha'is. In
 February the OMDH published a list of 52 former political prisoners, human rights
 monitors, lawyers and others who continued to be denied passports. In a series of
 spring meetings, 6CDH members met with Ministry of the Interior officials and re-
 quested status reports on several passport applications. By years' end the Ministry
 issued passports to 46 persons on the OMDH list. Some former political prisoners,
 after being issued passports, were denied exit at border points on the basis that gov-
 ernment computers had not been updated to reflect their eligibility to leave. There
 continued to be reports of instances in which police seized passports at border points
 or otherwise blocked the exit of Moroccans trying to leave the country, usually with-
 out explanation.
 Women must have permission from either their fathers or husbands to obtain a
 passport. A divorced woman must have her father's permission to obtain a passport
 and, if she has custody of the children, she must have permission of the children's
 father for passports to be issued to the children. Although the King has character-
 ized the male consent requirement as contrary to Islam and the Constitution, no
 changes in these provisions were made in 1993.
 There are frequent allegations of corruption in the passport offices; applicants are
 reportedly forced to paZ gratuities to obtain application forms and to make sure that
 the application is not {ost in the bureaucratic labyrinth. All Moroccan civil servants
 must obtain written permission from their ministries to leave the country each time
 they wish to do so.
 Moroccans may not renounce Moroccan citizenship, but the King has the rarely
 used power to revoke it. Tens of thousands of Moroccans hold more than one citizen-
 ship and travel on passports from two or more countries. While in Morocco they are
 regarded as Moroccan citizens. As a result, the Government has sometimes refused
 to recognize the right of foreign embassies to act on behalf of dual nationals or even
 to receive information concerning their arrest and imprisonment. Dual nationals
 also complain of harassment by Moroccan immigration inspectors.
 Moroccan law encourages voluntary repatriation of Moroccan Jews who have emi-
 grated; Moroccan Jewishemigres, including those with Israeli citizenship, freely
 visit Morocco. The law also encourages the return of Saharans who have opposed
 Morocco in the Western Sahara conflict. Returning former members of the Po isario,
 a group seeking independence for the Western Sahara, who are deemed to pose no
 threat to security are integrated into Moroccan life.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Moroccan citizens do not enjoy the right to change their government by demo-
 cratic means. The King, as Head of State, appoints the Prime Minister, who is the
 titular head of government. The Parliament has the theoretical authority to effect
 change in the system of government, but has never exercised it. Moreover, the Con-
 stitution may not be changed without the King's approval. The Ministry of the Inte-
 rior appoints provincial governors. Municipal councils are elected.
 Constitutional changes in 1992 vested in the Prime Minister the power to nomi-
 nate all other government ministers. However, the King retained the right to re-
 an minister at will. Any significant surrender of power from the crown to the
 rime Mnister's office was further obviated by an April decree by which the King
 grcatly increased beth the power and the pay of the secretaries general of the min-
 istries. The decree effectively delegated to the secretaries general many of the pow-
 ers previously vested in the ministers. The secretaries general serve at the pleasure
 of the King.
 The first parliamentary elections in 9 years were held in 1993. Under reforms im-
 plemented in 1992, electoral commissions were empowered to oversee the election
 process and to hear complaints of irregularities, but the conduct of the elections re-
 mained in the hands of the Interior Ministry, Of the 333 members of Parliament,
 222 are elected directly by universal adult suffrage, while 111 are elected indirectly
 by various business, labor, and agricultural organizations. In the direct elections
 held in June, opposition parties did very well. This first phase of the elections re-
 ceived generally favorable marks from international observers. Although informed
 observers expected opposition parties to solidify their gains in the indirect elections
 in September, the second stage left opposition parties barely short of the strength
 needed to form a coalition government and resulted in widespread charges of elec-
 
 
 1256
 tion fraud and manipulation, ranging from the strong-arming of association mem-
 bers responsible for nominating candidates to the falsification of voting lists.
 Several new parties were created during the elections. Sixteen parties are now of-
 ficially recognized by the Interior Ministry.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 There are three officially recognized nongovernmental human rights groups: the
 Moroccan Human Rights Organization (OMDH), the Moroccan League for the De-
 fense of Human Rights (LMDDH), and the Moroccan Human Rights Association
 (AMDH). LMDDH, associated with the Istiqlal Party, and AMDH, associated with
 the Party of the Socialist Avant Garde, have formeda coordinating committee and
 generally issue joint communiques. The LMDDH and the nonpartisan OMDH ac-
 cepted invitations to participate in CCDH activities. All three groups report that
 ministries, usually Justice and Interior, invariably fail to respond or even acknowl-
 edge their inquiries regarding particular human rights cases. Investigations by Mo-
 roccan human rights groups are generally conducted with neither government hin-
 drance nor cooperation.
 As noted in Section 2.b., the authorities continued to impede the ability of human
 rights groups to hold public meetings and in one instance picked up a human rights
 group leader for several hours of questioning about the group's activities.
 At the urging of CCDH, the Government in 1993 allowed the first visit by an
 international human rights group in 3 years. In an interview prior to the arrival
 of a delegation from Amnesty International (Al), King Hassan II pointedly attacked
 Ars methods and credibility. Nevertheless, the delegation came away, after 18 hours
 of meetings with the CCDH, encouraged by the Government's willingness to engage
 in a human rights dialogue. Al representatives returned in December.
 In general, however, the Government does not cooperate with international inves-
 tigations of allegations of human rights abuses in Morocco. It generally does not re-
 spond to inquiries about specific political prisoners made by diplomatic missions. If
 allowed in the country, human rights monitors are generally refused access to peo-
 ple or conditions they want to see.
 In 1990, in response to criticism of Morocco's human rights performance, the King
 created the CCDH, among whose responsibilities was the representation of Morocco
 at international human rights forums such as the United Nations Human Rights
 Commission and with foreign nongovernmental organizations. CCDH's powers are
 not commensurate with its mandate from the King to expose and correct abuses of
 human rights. While it proposes reforms to the Palace and some of its recommenda-
 tions, such as a reduction in the period of permissible precharge detention, are im-
 plemented, its capacity to investigate a particular report of abuse is limited to mak-
 ing inquiry of the concerned ministry, usually Interior, and awaiting a reply. CCDH
 has neither the authority to hold government officers responsible for abuses nor the
 inclination to condemn publicly the consistent failure of ministries to respond to its
 inquiries.
 A Moroccan government official served as interim president of the preparatory
 commission for the 1993 World Conference on Human Rights in Geneva.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 Women.-Moroccan women suffer various forms of discrimination, both legal and
 cultural. Under the Criminal Code, women are generally accorded the same treat-
 ment as men. Women are not accorded equal treatment under family and estate
 law, which is based on the Malikite school of Islamic law. In marriage, for example,
 a husband may repudiate his wife, but the wife may not repudiate her husband. The
 situations under which a woman may sue for divorce are far fewer than those per-
 mitted to men. Women inherit only half as much as their male siblings. Moreover,
 even where the law guarantees equal status, cultural norms often prevent a wom-
 an's exercise of those rights. When a Moroccan woman inherits property from a fa-
 ther or husband, for example, male relatives may force her to sign over her interest.
 Many well-educated women succeed in breaking into the professional ranks, par-
 ticularly in the areas of law, medicine, education, and government service. There
 are, however, few women in the top echelons of their professions. Women comprise
 approximately 24 percent of the work force, with the majority of them in the indus-
 trial, service, and teaching sectors. Women have the right to vote and to run for of-
 fice. Some women have been elected to municipal councils and two women were
 elected to Parliament in 1993. There are no women on the CCDH, nor are there
 any women serving as government ministers.

 Women suffer most from inequality in the rural areas. Rural women perform most
 hard physical labor; the rate of literacy, particularly in the countryside, is noticeably
 lower for women than for men; and girls are much less likely to be sent to school
 than are boys. Women who earn their secondary school diploma, however, have
 equal access to university training.
 The law and social practices governing violence against women reflect Morocco's
 Islamic culture and the importance placed on the honor of the family. The Criminal
 Code includes severe punishment for men who are convicted of raping or violating
 a woman or girl, and the defendant bears the burden of proving his innocence. How-
 ever, sexual assaults often go unreported because of the stigma attached to the loss
 of virginity. A rapist may be offered the opportunity to marry his victim in order
 to preserve the honor of the victim's family. Although a woman who is the victim
 of wife beating has the right to complain to the police, as a practical matter she
 could do so only if prepared to file for divorce and leave her husband's home. The
 law excuses the murder or injury of a wife who is caught in the act of committing
 adultery. A woman would not be excused for committing violence against her hus-
 band under the same circumstances.
 The civil law status of Moroccan women is governed by the Moudouwana, or Code
 of Personal Status, which is based in part on the Koran. With the active support
 of the King, limited reform of the Moudouwana, consistent with the mandates of the
 Koran, were effected in 1993. The amendments allow a wife to divorce a husband
 who announces an intent to take a second wife; grant a wife unspecified allowance
 rights, based on the husband's income, in cases where a husband files for divorce
 without legal justification; and recognize a wife's priority of right to custody of any
 children after a divorce. Women's groups in Morocco unsuccessfully requested that
 the Moudouwana changes include expanded rights to combat spousal violence, a
 problem they believe to be commonplace. Presently, a wife's charge of spousal abuse,
 even if proven, merely entitles her to divorce with no mandatory economic support.
 Hence, victims of spousal abuse are unlikely to report its occurrence to authorities.
 Children.-Morocco launched in November a campaign to vaccinate children
 against reventable diseases. However, the Government takes little action to pro.
 mote child welfare in the areas of child labor (see Section 6.d.) and education. The
 announced illiteracy rate is 55 percent, and the actual rate is higher, especially in
 rural areas.
 At year's end, the Moroccan daily 'L'Opiion summarized several cases involving
 the physical abuse of young maids by their employers. At least two 1993 cases were
 before Moroccan courts. In the first, a Casablanca police officer and his wife were
 arrested for severely beating a 6-year-old maid recruited from poor rural relatives.
 In the second, a military officer's wife from Meknes was arrested for the murder
 of a 14-year-old maid who died after admission to a hospital exhibiting symptoms
 of torture and starvation. After citing scores of examples of the abuse of young girls
 employed as domestics, LOpinion concluded that documented cases were merely the
 "tip of the iceberg" and accused the Government of callous indifference to the prob-
 lem.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-The Constitution affirms the legal equality
 of all Moroccans, and the Government does not discriminate based on ethnicity.
 The official language of Morocco is Arabic, and the languages of instruction and
 the news media are Arabic and French. Science and technical curriculums are
 taught in French, thereby eliminating the large monolingual Arabic population from
 these programs. Moroccan educational reforms over the past decade have stressed
 use of Arabic in secondary schools. Failure to similarly transform the university sys-
 tem has functionally disqualified many students, especially those from poorer homes
 where French tutoring is not practicable, from higer education in lucrative fields.
 People with Disabilities.-A high incidence of disabling disease, especially polio,
 has produced a large population of disabled persons in Morocco. Wlhile the Ministry
 of Social Affairs contends that the Government endeavors to integrate the disabled
 into society, this in practice is left largely to private charities. However, charitable
 special education schools are priced beyond the reach of most families. Most typi-
 cally, disabled persons survive by begging. The Government recently initiated a pilot
 training program for the blind. There are no laws guaranteeing access for the dis-
 abled.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution guarantees "the right of association
 and the right to join any trade union and political organization." Workers are free
 to form and join unions, and the right is exercised widely. According to the trade
 union federations, well over a million of Morocco's 9 million workers are unionized;
 
 
 1258
 
 5 percent of the work force is a more accurate estimate. Substantial numbers of
 workers in the public sector are unionized.
 Three of the 17 existing trade union federations dominate the labor scene; all are
 organizationally independent of the Government. They are the Union Marocaine de
 Travail (UMT) the Confederation Democratique de Travail (CDT) and the Union
 Generale des Travalleurs Marocains (UGTM). The UMT has no political affiliation
 the CDT is linked to the Socialist Union of Popular Forces (USFP), and the UGTM
 to the nationalist Istiqlal Party.
 Unions are not entirely free of government influence. The internal intelligence
 services of the Interior Ministry keep the Government fully apprised of trade union
 activity, and the selection of union officers and the carrying out of their duties are
 sometimes subject to government pressure.
 Within individual unions, the right to select one's own leaders is usually recog-
 nized. However some violations occur, in May the UMT's national headquarters
 unilaterally replaced the regional leaders in the town of El Jadida by forcefully ex-
 pelling the local leaders andreplaci  them with their own.
 Under the Constitution, wokers have the right to strike and do so. Most work
 stoppages are intended to advertise grievances; they usually last 24 hours or less.
 However, strikes can be prolonged and arise not only from economic demands or
 working conditions but also from union rivalries. Partially in response to a royal
 warning not to disturb social peace prior to the parliamentary elections, there were
 relatively few strikes in early 1993, and the labor scene remained relatively quiet
 after the June elections in anticipation of the formation of a new, more prolabor gov-
 ernment. Teacher trainees performing 2 years of civil service conducted a sit-in and
 hunger strike in the summer to demand permanent positions; the first attempt at
 the sit-in in July was broken up by police, and some protesters were arrested. A
 number of limited 1- and 2-day strikes closed most college and high school campuses
 for several days in February and March as teachers struck over longstanding griev-
 ances, including pay, working conditions, and benefits. There were similar 2-day
 strikes in the public health, railroads, and postal sectors in March.
 The release from prison of CDT Secretary General Noubir Amaoui and UGTM ac-
 tivist Driss Laghnimi in July was seen as a sign of greater government willingness
 to cooperate with labor following the success of prlabor parties in the June legisla-
 tive elections. The International Labor Organization (ILO) Committee on Freedom
 of Association (CFA), reviewing several complaints at its 1993 sessions about arrest
 of trade unionists for participating in strikes or distributing material expressing po-
 litical opinions, expressed concern that the Government had not respected workers'
 right to freedom of association.
 Unions and union federations are free to affiliate internationally and do so ac-
 tively. The UMT rejoined the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions in
 1990 after an absence of many years.
 Unions belong to regional labor organizations and maintain ties with inter-
 national trade secretariats.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The Constitution includes
 labor organizations among the entities that serve to "organize and represent the
 citizens. An implied right to organize and bargain collectively is exercised, but laws
 protecting collective bargaining are not highly developed. The multiplicity of trade
 union federations creates competition to organize workers. Any group of eight work-
 ers may organize, and a worker may change trade union affiliation. Thus, a single
 factory may contain several independent locals or locals affiliated with more than
 one labor federation.
 In both the process of organizing and during collective bargaining, labor laws are
 widely observed most often in the corporate and parastatal sectors of the economy,
 where ad hoc government mediation and arbitration procedures to promote worker-
 employer negotiations are easily applied. These mediation procedures do not in prac-
 tice limit unions' freedom to bargain collectively. The unions' most common com-
 plaint against employers is that they refuse to negotiate seriously.
 In the informal and underground economies and in the textile and handicrafts
 fields, labor laws and regulations are poorly enforced. Small employers, especially
 in the agricultural sector are often ignorant of labor laws and regulations. While
 the right to orgaize and bargain collectively exists in both the Constitution and
 labor law, the Government does not always protect this right. As a practical matter,
 the unions have no judicial recourse to oblige the Government to act when it has
 not met its obligations under the law. Moreover, political considerations often lead
 the Government to hinder the full exercise of worker rights in an effort to control
 the unions.
 In some parts of the industrial and parastatal sectors there is a long-established
 tradition of collective bargaining, but this practice is not spreading to emerging sec-
 
 
 1259
 tors of the economy. The wages of unionized workers are established through prac-
 tices that include discussions between employer and worker representatives. How-
 ever, wages for the vast majority of nonunionized workers are set unilaterally by
 the employer, ostensibly respecting the minimum wage law. In the industrial sector,
 collective bargaining agreements are often invoked in legal disputes when a worker
 claims to have been reprimanded or dismissed for trade union activity. Employers
 usually cite work-related reasons for the dismissals. An employer intending to fire
 workers without replacing them must apply in advance to the provincial governor
 through the Labor Inspector's office. In cases where employers plan to replace fired
 workers, the Labor Inspector provides replacements and mediates the cases of work-
 ers who protest their dismissal. Any worker fired for a serious infraction such as
 sabotage is entitled by law to a court hearing.
 Notwithstanding the constitutional provision noted above, Morocco's ratification of
 ILO Convention 98 on the right to organize and bargain collectively, and some case
 law, there is no specific law prohibiting antiunion discrimination by employers. Em-
 ployers regularly fire workers for trade union activity that they see as threatening
 to employer interests. Reinstatement is sometimes ordered by courts, but legal pro-
 ceedings can be expensive and time-consuming. Labor complainants are often vindi-
 cated in court proceedings, but court decisions awarding damages and back pay can
 be difficult to enforce Ministry of Labor inspectors serve as investigators and concil-
 iators in labor disputes; however, the inspectors are not very effective because they
 are few in number, carry heavy workloads, and do not have the resources to inves-
 tigate all cases. In addition to pursuing their complaints through the Ministry of
 Labor's inspectors, unions increasingly are going directly to court with their com-
 plaints. ILO committees repeatedly cited the Government in 1993 for failing to re-
 spend adequately to union allegations of violations of trade union rights such as dis-
 missing and arresting trade unionists and repressing demonstrations. In May the
 CFA concluded that protection against antiunion discrimination is not satisfactorily
 guaranteed by the Government.
 Moroccan labor law applies equally to the small Tanger export zone. The propor-
 ton of unionized workers there is about the same as in Morocco as a whole.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Apart from its ratification of both
 ILO conventions against forced labor, Morocco has no legal or constitutional prohibi-
 tion against force or compulsory labor, but, as far as is known, it is not practiced.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-Children may not be legally em-
 ployed or apprenticed before age 12. Special regulations govern the employment of
 children between the ages of 12 and 16. Those under the age of 16 ma  not work
 nights (between 11 p.m. and 5 a.m.) nor more than 10 hours a day. TWe normal
 workday is 8 hours; only in a few exceptional professions are any workers permitted
 to work more than 10 hours per day. n practice, children are often apprenticed be-
 fore age 12, particularly in handicraft work. The argument is made that they need
 to acquire skills, such as weaving or rug making, before they reach the age of 12.
 Five years of primary education is compulsory, starting at age 7, but enforcement
 in the countryside and poorer urban areas is lax.
 Safety and health conditions as well as salaries in enterprises employing children
 are often substandard. The use of minors is common in the rug-making and tanning
 trades, many of whose products are exported. Children are also employed informally
 as domestics and usually receive little or no wages. Poverty and a pervasive cultural
 acceptance of child labor keep abuse of the child labor laws prevalent nationwide.
 In 1993 a Casablanca policeman and his wife were arrested for severely beating a
 6-year old maid, recruited from poor, rural relatives.
 The Ministry of Labor, through its corps of labor inspectors, is responsible for en-
 forcing child labor regulations. Child labor laws are generally well observed in the
 industrialized, unionized sector of the economy. However, the inspection mandate of
 labor inspectors does not include domestic employees.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-There was no change in 1993 to the minimum
 wage of about $150 (1,350 dirhams) per month, effective as of May 1992. Despite
 fool, diesel fuel, and public transportation subsidies, a family cannot maintain a de-
 cent standard of living on the minimum wage of a single worker. The labor unions
 have long called for a minimum wage of about $220. In many cases, several mem-
 bers, some of them working in the informal economy, combine their income to sup-
 p ort the family. The minimum wage is not enforced effectively in the informal and
 andicraft sectors. It is enforced fairly effectively in the industrialized, unionized
 sector, though members complain that employers often, by means of deductions and
 other techniques, pay their workers less than the law requires.
 In an effort to increase employment opportunities for recent graduates, firms are
 permitted to hire them for a limited period for less than the minimum wage. Firms
 are not allowed to replace them with other low-paid trainees when the limited em-
 
 
 1260
 
 ployment period ends. Most workers in the industrial sector of the economy, except
 for those employed in garment assembly, earn more than minimum wage.
 Moreover, workers are customarily paid between 13 and 16 months' salary for
 every 12-month year. The informal sector provides a safety net for those who would
 otherwise be unemployed or underemployed. The extensive parallel economy em-
 ploys directly or indirectly an estimated 50 to 75 percent of the working population,
 often in part-time jobs.
 The law provides a 48-hour maximum workweek and a 24-hour rest period, with
 not more than 8 hours (with certain exceptions) for any single day, premium pay
 for overtime, paid public and annual holidays, and minimum conditions for health
 and safety, including the prohibition of night work for women and minors. As with
 other regulations and laws, these are observed unevenly, if at all, in the informal
 sector. Labor inspectors endeavor to monitor working conditions, accidents, and
 labor disputes, but lack sufficient resources and authority to investigate many com-
 plaints and mandate full compliance with the law.
