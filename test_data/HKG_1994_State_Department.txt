 HONG KONG
 Hong Kong, a small, densely populated British dependency, is a free society with
 legally protected rights. Its constitutional arrangements are defined by the Letters
 Patent and Royal Instructions. Executive powers are vested in a British Crown-ap-
 pointed Governor who holds extensive authority. The judiciary is an independent
 body adhering to English common law with certain variations. Fundamental rights
 ultimately rest on oversight by the British Parliament. In practice, however, Hong
 Kong largely controls its own internal affairs. The Governor appoints an advisory
 Executive Council and a partially representative Legislative Council has limited
 powers.
 A well-organized civilian police force maintains public order and generally re-
 spects the human rights of the populace. There were, however, instances in which
 police used excessive force.
 Hong Kong, a major regional and international trade and financial center, is the
 principal gateway for trade and investment with China. Its prosperous free market
 economy operates on the basis of minimal government interference. Per capita gross
 domestic production was about $20,000 in 1994.
 Human rights monitors, journalists, and concerned legislators criticized the Gov-
 ernment for opposing major human rights initiatives, including the establishment
 of a human rights commission and legislation against discrimination. Human rights
 problems included an increasing amount of self-censorship by the media, the inabil-
 ity of people to change their government, and discrimination against women. There
 were allegations of police use of excessive force; the authorities investigated and
 punished offenders in accordance with existing laws and regulations.

 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Mlling.-There were no reports of political or
 other extrajudicial killings.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of disappearance.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The law forbids torture and other extreme forms ofabuse and stipulates punish-
 ment of those using them. However, police officers continued to use excessive force.
 During the first half of the year, complainants filed 797 allegations of assault by
 the police. As of July, the authorities had substantiated 64 of these.
 Disciplinary action ranged from criminal proceedings to dismissal or warnings.
 The Office of Police Complaints investigates complaints. The Police Complaints
 Committee, which consists of independent members appointed by the Governor,
 monitors and reviews the handling of such complaints. The Government, however,
 continues to resist public calls for the creation of an independent body to investigate
 allegations of police abuse.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile-British legal protections and common law
 traditions govern the process of arrest and detention and ensure substantial and ef-
 fective legal protections against arbitrary arrest or detention.
 Exile is not practiced.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The judicial and legal systems are organized ac-
 cording to principles of British law and legal precedent, and feature, inter alia, an
 independent judiciary and trial by jury. The law provides the right to a fair public
 trial, and this is respected in practice.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The law
 prvides for the right of privacy, and the Government generally respects this right.
 The 9dendaent Commission Against Corruption (I AC) is vested with powers
 which are normally exercised only by a judicial officer. Amendments to ordinances
 governing the ICAC deprived it of this independent authority to issue arrest or
 search warrants (it must now go to the courts), but it still operates on the assump-
 tion that any excessive, unexplainable assets held by civil servants are considered
 ill-gotten until proven otherwise.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-There is a tradition of free speech and press
 as practiced in the United Kingdom. Numerous views and opinions, including those
 independent or critical of the British, Hong Kong, and Chinese Governments are
 aired in the mass media, in public forums, and by political groups. International
 media organizations operate freely. However, several ordinances permit restrictions
 of the press, although authorities rarely impose them. The Government required a
 permit for the screening of a controversial British Broadcasting Cororation (BBC)
 documentary on Mao Zedong by the Foreign Correspondents Club, after China
 raised objections, but permitted the program to be shown.
 The imminent return to Chinese control, however, led some journalists to practice
 self-censorship. Several incidents during the year had a chilling effect on Hong
 Kong's media and on the media's judgments of the future press environment after
 1997. These included the admission by China's Ministry of Public Security that it
 has been gathering information on Hong Kong residents who are "against the Chi-
 nese Government,' the Chinese Government's secret trial and sentencing of Hong
 Kong reporter Xi Yang to 12 years' imprisonment for stealing "state financial se-
 rets," and Chinese Govenment actions taken against Hong Kong businessman/
 publisher Jimmy La's commercial establishments in Bijing after Lai published an
 open letter critical of Chinese Premier Li Peng. Following up these incidents, Asia
 Television (ATV) executives attempted to cancel a news program about the sixth an-
 niversaiy of the June 4, 1989, Tiaanmen Massacre. This sparked resignations by
 members of the station's senior editorial staff, who alleged that management feared
 possible repercussions from Chinese Government objections to the program's airing.
 Management decided to broadcast the program. In April the Newscorp Satellife
 Broadcasting Station, STAR TV, terminated broadcast of BBC news from its north-
 ern beam, wLnch covers China and Hong Kong. It is widely assumed that Newscorp
 did so because of Chinese Government objections to the BBs "critical" reporting
 on China.
 Journalists re port that such self-censorship is also increasing for commercial rea-
 sons, as Hong Kong-based media organiatons which are expanding their ties in
 China seek to avoid offending the Chinese Government. Following Chinese objec-
 tions to a Hong Kong Government proposal to privatize the government-owned
 Radio Television Hong Kong (RTHK), there have been no further efforts by the
 
 
 1034
 Hong Kong Government to do so. The Government opposed freedom of information
 legis ation proposed by Legislative Council members and instead decided that an ad-
 ministrative code of practice on access to government information should be devel-
 oped.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The authorities imposed no
 significant hindrance on the freedom of peaceful assembly and association, although
 the amended Societies Ordinance requires officeholders to notify the Police Commis-
 sioner of the formation of a society. The Societies Officer may recommend to the Sec-
 retary for Security that the operation or continued operation of a society be prohib-
 ited if he reasonably believes that the operation or continued operation may be prej-
 udicial to the security of Hong Kong, or to public safety, or public order. While the
 provision in the Ordinance allowing the Government to refuse to register an organi-
 zation "incompatible with peace, welfare, or good order" or affiliated with a political
 organization abroad was repealed in 1992, China adopted similar language in the
 Basic Law which will become effective in 1997.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Hong Kong bill of rights includes a provision prohib-
 iting discrimination on the basis of religion. The various faiths represented in Hong
 Kong are able to practice without restrictions.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Government does not impose restrictions on the travel of legal resi-
 dents or visitors within or outside Hong Kong.
 Hong Kong has never refused to accept nor pushed off Vietnamese boat people.
 Refugee status was automatically accorded prior to June 1988, after which boat peo-
 ple were screened to determine their status, and held in prisn-like detention cen-
 ters awaiting resettlement in other countries or repatriation to Vietnam. In 1991
 the United Kingdom and Vietnam reached agreement on the mandatory repatriation
 of those whom the authorities determined not to be refugees. The Hong Kong Gov-
 ernment completed all initial screening of Vietnamese asylum seekers in March.
 The Government announced completion of all secondary screening by the Refugee
 Status Review Board.
 Reintgration assistance programs inside Vietnam, funded by the European
 Union, the Hon Kong Government, the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees
 (UNHCR), and thie United States provided an incentive for those not eligible for
 third-country resettlement to return to Vietnam. On August 8, the Hong Kong Gov-
 ernmentbeganofferg a "special reintegration allowance of $150 to all Vietnamese
 migrants who by years end volunte ered to repatriate. Funding came from money
 set aside by the British Government. Of those found ineligible for resettlement or
 not yet screened, sine 1989 more than 44,217 have voluntarily returned under the
 Comprehensive Plan of Action agreed on in Geneva in that year, with 5,581 return-
 ig in 1994. Some 24,000 Vietnamese boat people remain in Hong Kong. In May
 1992, the Government rached agreement with Vietnamese authorities on an Or-
 derly Return Program (ORP) for the compulsory return of screned-out nonrefugees
 in detention centers. Under the program, people are randomly chosen from among
 the nonrefugee camp population and are moved to a separate location several days
 before a flights schedulred departure. Government security officers then escort all
 those being mandatorily returned on to the plane and accompany the flight to Viet-
 nam.
 On April 7, 1,250 security officials used over 550 canisters of tear gas to remove
 1,500 screened-out asylum seekers prtesting the selection of individuals for the
 ORP. Scores of persons were   ured, and a government investigation resulted in the
 indictment of three security officers charged with using excessive force. While initial
 stories of a similar operation conducted in September mentioned 200 injured asylum
 seekers, a report later issued by three neutral nongovernmental organization ob-
 servers discounted those claims and praised the government's handling of the mnci-
 dent. In a third action about a month later, security officials again sed minimal
 force, which resulted in three minor injuries to protesting asylum seekers. The Gov-
 ernment recently has adopted new procedures to prevent excessive violnce, includ-
 ing the regular appointment of independent monitors to observe such operations.
 ORP flights resumed on September 20 and by year's end the Government had re-
 turned 250 persons aboard ORP flights, and a total of 1,175 persons since the pro-
 gram began.
 The Government maintained its policy of deporting illegal Chinese immigrants to
 China, except in rare instances in which a person was found to be qualified as a
 refugee within the meaning of the U.N. Protocol on the Status of Refugees. There
 were 2,400 ethnic Vietnamese who fled from China to Hong Kong in 1993. Called
 Ex-China Vietnamese Illegal   mgrants (ECVUS) by the Governh   ent, they were
 not recognized as refugees by the UNHCR or local authorities, and 446 were still
 
 
 1035
 in detention as of December, another 14 were released when Chinese authorities
 were unable to verify that they had been resettled in China.
 Following China's expulsion of Han Dongfang, a Chinese labor organizer, when
 he returned to China in August 1993, the Government has repeatedly renewed
 Han's permit to remain in the territory. The Chinese Government has refused to
 allow Han's return to China. (See also the China report.)
 Section 3. Respect for Politi=l Right&- The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Although the Government has adopted measures to democratize district and mu-
 nicipal boards and the Legislative Council, citizens of the Territory do not have the
 right to change their governor and only very limited ability to effect changes in their
 government. The Governor is appointed by and serves at the pleasure of the Crown.
 He is advised on policy by an Executive Council which he appoints.
 The Legislative Council enacts and funds legislation. It also debates policy and
 questions the administration. Although the Legislature's power to initiate legislation
 is limited (all bills with budgetary implications, for example, must be approved by
 the Government before introduction), it has become increasingly assertive. The Gov-
 ernor has ultimate control of the administration of Hong Kong but, by convention,
 rarely exercises his full powers. In practice, decisions are reached through consen-
 sus.
 Political parties and independent candidates are free to contest seats in free and
 fair elections. Representative government employing universal franchise exists at
 the local district board level. All municipal board members will be elected in 1995.
 However, of the Legislative Council's 60 members, only 18 were elected by universal
 suffrage in 1991, and this number will increase by only 2 in elections in 1995. Cur-
 rently, 21 members were either appointed by the Governor or are themselves gov-
 ernment officials. Another 21 were elected by functional constituencies which dis-
 rportionately represent the economic and professional elites and, moreover, vio-
 late the concept of one person-one vote, since voters in functional constituencies may
 vote both in a functional and a geographic constituency. The Legislative Council
 adopted Governor Chris Patten's proposals broadening the political franchise by low-
 ering the voting age frum 21 to 18, opening all district board seats to direct election,
 increasing the number of Functional Constituencies (elected by professional groups)
 from 21 to 30, and providing Hong Kong residents greater say in the selection of
 Functional Constituency Legislative Council members previously selected by narrow
 constituencies.
 The Government is also implementing legislation which will abolish all appointed
 seats in the 1995 election and significantly broaden functional constituencies to
 allow all working residents a second vote. These measures will still not result in
 a fully representative, democratically elected government. In the absence of prior
 Sino-British agreement on these measures, the Chinese Government announced its
 intention to disband Hong Kong's elected bodies when the territory reverts to China
 in 1997.
 Hong Kong Chinese are seriously underrepresented in senior government posi-
 tions. The Government is continuing efforts to place Hong Kong Chinese in senior
 positions and has publicly committed to fill "principal official" posts with local offi-
 cars before 1997. Expatriates remain in key positions in the Legal Department and
 judiciary. The Government's efforts to add  inese to the Government have been
 opposed by a group of expatriate government workers who have undertaken legal
 action against the Government, claiming they are being discriminated against under
 the provisions of Hong Kong's Bill of Rights. The case is still pending. Women are
 playing a greater role in poatics, with greater numbers running for public office in
 the 1934 elections than ever before. Women comprise 13 percent of the Legislative
 Council and 8 percent of the senior ranks of the government secretariat.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Although the Government to date has interposed no official barriers to the forma-
 tion of local human rights groups, some human rights monitors believe that provi-
 sions of the Societies Ordinance provide the legal means whereby a future govern-
 ment could do so. The Government consistently cooperated with international and
 nongovernmental human rights organizations on human rights issues. The Inter-
 national Covenants on Civil and Political Rights and on Economic, Social, and Cul-
 tural Rights currently apply to Hong Kong through the United Kingdom. The
 UNHCR and nongovernmental human rights organizations have full a           to
 camps for Vietnamese boat people.

 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 There is no legislation banning discrimination. Some Legislative Council members
 supported the introduction of antidiscrimination measures addressing the problems
 of sex, age, race, and age discrimination, but the Government opposed the legisla-
 tion, indicating that it would introduce its own bill banning discrimination on the
 basis of sex and disability. It has not yet done so. The Chinese language has equal
 status with English in government operations except in judicial proceedings. To help
 remedy this, the Government has increased the number of directorate officers in the
 Legal Aid Department proficient in Chinese from three (of nine) to seven.
 Women.-Violence and discrimination against women remain significant prob-
 lems. The only legislation to protect the rights of battered women is the 1987 Do-
 mestic Violence Ordinance, which enables a woman to seek a 3-month injunction
 against her husband. This may be extended to 6 months. In addition, domestic vio-
 lence may be prosecuted as common assault under existing criminal statutes. The
 Government enforces these laws and prosecutes violators.
 Nevertheless, women's action groups continue to press for better legal and govern-
 ment provisions for battered wives. They call for public housing to house women as
 soon as they leave their violent husbands. Harmony House, a private agency which
 receives some government subsidies, and the Social Welfare Department operate
 two homes which offer refuge to a small number of women. Harmony House also
 has conducted training programs for police personnel on how to deal with domestic
 violence. Many instances of domestic violence, however, are not reported, owing
 partly to cultural factors which frown on exposing family crisis to the public eye,
 ut also to the Government's failure to publicize information about the assistance
 and resources available.
 Women face discrimination in the areas of employment, salary, welfare, inherit-
 ance, and promotion. Discrimination on the basis of age, particularly in hiring prac-
 tices, is openly practiced and is not prohibited by law. Legislation to prohibit exist-
 ing clan practices in the New Territories which discriminate against women on the
 basis of inheritance rights recently was app roved by the Legislative Council in 1994.
 Children.-The Government supports child welfare programs including custody,
 protection, day care, foster care, shelters, and small group homes. Assistance is also
 provided to families. Child abuse and exploitation are not widespread problems.
 People With Disabilities.-There is no law mandating accessibility to buildings
 and government services for disabled persons. Organizations and individuals rep-
 resenting the interests of the disabled claim that discrimination exists in employ-
 ment, edution, and the provision of some state services. The Government contin-
 ues to oppose legislation addressing the needs of people with disabilities.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The right of association and the right of workers to
 establish and join organizations of their own choosing are provided for by law. Trade
 unions must be registered under the Trade Unions Ordinance. The basic pre-
 condition for registration is a minimum of seven persons who serve in the same oc-
 cupation. The Government does not discourage or impede the formation of unions.
 During 1993, 22 new trade unions were registered. Approximately 543,800 workers
 (roughly 20 percent) of a total labor force of 2.6 million belong to the 532 registered
 unions, most of which belong to one of three major trade union federations.
 Work stoppages and strikes are permitted. However, the Government places some
 restrictions on this right for civil servants. Even though the Employment Ordinance
 recognizes the right to strike, in practice most workers must sign employment con-
 tracts which typically state that walking off the job is a breach of contract and can
 lead to summary dismissal. The Employment Ordinance also permits firms to dis-
 charge or deduct wages from staff who are absent on account ofa labor dispute.
 Labor unions may form federations, confederations, and affiliate with inter-
 national bodies. However, the Government must approve any affiliation with foreign
 labor unions. The Government has never refused such applications. The United
 Kingdom makes declarations on behalf of the territory concerning Hong Kong's obli-
 gations regarding the various International Labor Organization (ILO) conventions.
 To date, -ong Kong has implemented provisions applymg 31 ILO conventions in full
 and 18 others with modifications. In the Basic Law, China undertook to continue
 to adhere to these conventions after 1997.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Although there are no laws
 mandating collectivebargaining, ILO Convention 98 on the right to organize and
 bargain collectively is one of the 31 ILO conventions referred to above which are
 applied without modification in Hong Kong. Wage rates in a few trades such as tal-
 
 
 1037
 1ring and carpentry are determined by collective bargaining, but most wages are
 set by market forces.
 Unions generally are not powerful enough to force management to engage in col-
 lective bargaining. The Government does not encourage it, since the Government it-
 self does not engage in collective bargaining with civil servants' unions but merely
 "consults" with them. Free conciliation services are afforded by the Labor Relations
 Division of the Department of Labor (DOL) to employers and employees involved in
 disputes which may involve statutory benefits and protection in employment as well
 as arrears of wages, wages in lieu of notice, and severance pay. The DOL assists
 employers and employees to reach amicable settlements but does not have the au-
 thority to impose a solution. The DOL is not required by law to allow unions to rep-
 resent employees in these proceedings, although it takes a positive attitude toward
 the participation by trade unions in dispute negotiations. The Labor Tribunal Ordi-
 nance provides that an office bearer of a registered trade union, who is authorized
 in writing by a claimant or defendant to appear as his representative, has the right
 of audience in the labor tribunal.
 The law protects workers against antiunion discrimination. Employees who allege
 such discrimination have the right to have their cases heard by the DOL's Labor
 Relations Division. Violation of the antiunion discrimination provisions under the
 Employment Ordinance is a criminal offense carrying a maximum fine of $2,564.
 However, employers are not required to reinstate or compensate an employee.
 The International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) has strongly criti-
 cized as inadequate Hong Kong's labor legislation because of its failure to protect
 the right to strike, and its provisions allowing dismissals and disciplinary action
 against striking trade unionists. The Labor Tribunal adjudicates individual labor
 claims, purportedly to provide a quick and inexpensive machinery for resolving cer-
 tain types of disputes (the Tribunal complements the conciliation service provided
 by the Labor Relations Division.) Union leaders complain, however, that the Tribu-
 nal takes too long-an average of 130 days--to hear workers' cases.
 There are few protections for almost 100,000 Filipino domestic workers who face
 deprtation if dismissed by their employers and are thus vulnerable to abuse.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulso.ry Labor.-Labor legislation prohibits forced
 labor, and it is not practiced.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The Employment of Children Reg-
 ulations prohibit the employment of children under age 15 in any industrial estab-
 lishment. Children aged 13 and 14 may be employed in certain nonindustrial busi-
 nesses, subject to con itions aimed at ensuring a minimum of 9 years' education and
 protection of safety, health, and welfare. During 1993 the Government launched 14
 are-scale campaigns against the employment of children. They found only five chil-
 dren who were working in violation of the law. The Government successfully pros-
 ecuted four of these cases, with fines of around $370 levied in each case.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-There is no minimum wage, except for foreign
 domestic workers. Aside from a small number of trades and industries where a uni-
 form wage structure exists, wage levels are customarily fixed by individual agree-
 ment between employer and employee and are determined by market supply and
 demand. Because of continued shortages in the labor market (unemployment was
 around 2 percent), wage increases were given to most workers, particularly those
 in the construction industry and service sectors.
 There are no legal restrictions on hours of work for men. The Women and Young
 Persons (Industry) Regulations under the Employment Ordinance control hours and
 conditions of work for women and young people aged 15 to 17. Work is limited to
 8 hours per day and 48 hours per week between 6 a.m. and 11 p.m. for persons age
 16 or over. Overtime is restricted to 2 hours per day and 200 days per year for
 women, and is prohibited for all persons under 18 in industrial establishments. The
 regulations also prohibit women and young persons from working underground or,
 with the exception of males aged 16 and 17, in dangerous trades. During 1993 the
 Labor Inspectorate conducted 161,830 workplace inspections of about 160,000 estab-
 lishments, resulting in 4,720 prosecutions. The employment of underaged workers
 is not a serious problem.
 The DOL Factory Inspectorate sets basic occupational safety and health stand-
 ards, provides education and publicity, and follows up with enforcement and inspec-
 tion in accordance with the Factories and Industrial Undertakings Ordinance and
 subsidiary regulations. The Inspectorate makes regular visits to high-risk areas
 such as factories and construction sites. During 1993 the Factory Inspectorate car-
 ried out 56,668 inspections of factories and 13,947 inspections of constructions sites
 and issued 3,001 summonses. Fines dependea on the seriousness of the violation.
 
 
 1038
 In 1994 several serious building collapses revealed the need for stronger government
 enforcement and inspection efforts.
 The DOL Occupational Health Division investigates claims of occupational dis-
 eases and i *ies at work, conducts environmental testing in the workplace, and
 provides medical examinations to employees in occupations that involve the han-
 of hazardous materials. The small number of inspectors and the inability of
 workers to elect their own safety representatives weaken the enforcement of safety
 and health standards in the workplace. There is no specific legal provision allowing
 workers to remove themselves from dangerous work situations without jeopardy to
 continued employment.
