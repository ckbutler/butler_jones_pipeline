 BELGIUM
 Belgium is a parliamentary democracy under a constitutional monarch who plays
 a mainly symbolic role. The Council of Ministers (Cabinet), led by the Prime Min-
 ister, holds office as long as it retains the confidence of the lower house of the bi-
 cameral Parliament. Constitutional reforms enacted in 1993 transformed Belgium
 from a unitary into a federal state with several levels of government, including na-
 tional, regional (Flanders, Wallonia, and Brussels), and community (Flemish,
 Francophone, and German) levels.
 The Government maintains effective control of all security forces. The Police
 Judiciaire and the Belgian gendarmerie share responsibility for internal security
 with municipal police.
 Belgium is a highly industrialized state with a vigorous private sector and limited
 government participation in certain industries. The economy, buttressed by an ex-
 tensive social welfare system, su pports a high standard of living for most citizens.
 The Government fully respected the human rights of its citizens, and the law and
 an independent judiciary a ow for effective means of dealing with instances of indi-
 vidual abuse.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political or
 other extrajudicial killings.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The law prohibits such practices, and there were no reports that officials employed
 them.
 Prison conditions vary. Newer prisons meet international standards. Older facili-
 ties meet or strive to meet minimum international standards despite their Spartan
 physical conditions and limited resources. The Government permits visits by human
 rights monitors. In September the prison system designed to hold 6,616 prisoners
 had 7,371 occupants. In late 1995, the Government adopted measures that allow al-
 ternative sentencing, such as time in substance abuse treatment centers or commu-
 nity service. Additionally, the Cabinet adopted separate measures that are intended
 to reduce the judicial backlog. Both sets of measures are designed to reduce prison
 overcrowding problems.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The law prohibits arbitrary arrest, deten-
 tion, or exile, and the Government observes this prohibition. Arrested persons must
 be brought before a judge within 24 hours. Pretrial confinement is subject to month-
 ly review by a panel of judges, which may extend pretrial detention based on estab-
 lished criteria (e.g., whether, in the court's view, the arrested person would be likely
 to commit further crimes or attempt to flee the Jrisdiction if released). Bail exists
 in principle under the law but is rarely granted, and pretrial confinement is thus
 fairly common. Belgium no longer sees a need to separate convicted criminals and
 pretrial detainees. Pretrial detainees receive different benefits from convicted crimi-
 nals, such as more frequent family visitation rights. Approximately 40 percent of the
 total prison population consists of pretrial detainees. Arrested persons are allowed
 prompt access to a lawyer of their choosing or, if they cannot afford one, an attorney
 appointed by the State.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution provides for an independent judi-
 ciary, and the Government respects this provision in practice. The-judiciary provides
 citizens with a fair and efficient judicial process, enforcing the law's provision for
 the right to a fair trial. The judicial system is organized according to the principles
 of specialization and territorial jurisdiction, with 5 territorial levels: canton (222),
 district (27), province (9), courts of appeal (5), and the whole Kingdom-the Cour
 
 
 860
 de Cassation. The latter is the highest appeals court. When a preliminary judicial
 investigatory phase is completed, a suspect is formally charged if the evidence so
 warrants. Charges are clearly and formally stated, and there is a presumption of
 innocence. All defendants have the right to be present, to have counsel (at public
 expense if needed), to confront witnesses, to present evidence, and to appeal. Mili-
 tary tribunals try military personnel for common law as well as military crimes. All
 military tribunals consist of four officers and a civilian judge. At the appellate level
 the civilian judge presides. The accused has the right of appeal to a higher military
 court.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The law
 prohibits such practices, government authorities respect these prohibitions, and vio-
 lations are subject to effective legal sanction.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The law provides for these freedoms and the
 Government respects these rights in practice. An independent press, an effective ju-
 dicia , and a functioning democratic political system combine to ensure freedom of
 speeh and of the press, including academic freedom.
 The Government operates several radio and television networks but does not con-
 trol progam content. Programs are supervised by boards of directo-s which rep-
 resent the main political, linguistic, and opinion groups. A government representa-
 tive sits on each board but has no veto power. Private radio and television stations
 operate with government licenses. Almost all homes have access by cable to tele-
 vision from other Western European countries and elsewhere abroad. Satellite serv-
 ices are also available.
 There are restrictions on the press regarding libel, slander, and the advocacy of
 racial or ethnic discrimination, hate or violence.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The law provides for these
 rights, and the Government respects them in practice. Citizens are free to form or-
 ganizations and establish ties to international bodies, but the Antiracism Law (see
 Section 5) prohibits membership in organizations that practice discrimination overt-
 ly and repeatedl.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Government does not hinder the practice of any
 faith. The law accords "recognized" status to Roman Catholicism, Protestantism, Ju-
 daism, Anglicanism, Islam, and Greek and Russian Orthodoxy, and these receive
 subsidies drawn from general government revenues. Taxpayers who object to con-
 tributing to religious subsidies have no recourse. By law each recognized religion
 has the right to provide teachers at government expense for religious instruction in
 schools, but not all avail themselves of this right.
 In response to muss suicides in Switzerland in 1994 and in France in 1995, the
 Government established a commission to create a policy to combat the alleged dan-
 gers that sects may represent to society, espcially children. The commission's first
 task is to establish a working definition of %-ect.4No specific groups have been tar-
 geted, although 'Temple Solaire," the group involved in the incidents in France and
 Switzerland, was mentioned in the initial parliamentary discussion.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The law provides for these rights, and the Government respects them
 m practice.
 The Government cooperates with the United Nations High Commissioner for Ref-
 ugees and other humanitarian organizations in assisting refugees. The Government
 provides first asylum and provided it to 12,232 applicants in 1996, an increase of
 7 percent over the 1995 number of applicants. A total of 1,588 applicants, mostly
 from previous years, were granted permanent status in 1996. All asylum seekers
 can plead their cases before immigration authorities. There were no reports of forced
 expulsion of those having a valid claim to refugeefasylee status. Prior to March
 1995, the Government had a special procedure for refugees from the former Yugo-
 slavia under which 5,000 to 6,000 persons received "displaced person" status, while
 their cases were further considered. Many of these individuals have since received
 permanent status.
 As a result of a 1996 amendment to existing immigration law, asylum seekers ar-
 riving by air with no papers may be detained indefinitely in closed centers while
 awaiting consideration of their cases. Children in such centers do not attend school.
 At the discretion of the Minister of Interior, the Cabinet may exempt certain cities,
 which have already accepted large refugee populations, from giving legal residence
 to new refuges/asylees. Pursuant to the 1996 amendment to immigration law, asy-
 n seekers awaiting consideration of their cases will no longer qua ify for financial
 assistance but will be provided room and board at refugee centers.
 
 
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The law provides citizens with the right to change their government peacefully.
 Citizens age 18 and older exercise this right in practice through periodic, free, and
 fair elections held on the basis of universal and compulsory (under penalty of fine)
 suffrage. Direct popular elections for parliamentary seats (excluding some Senators
 elected by community councils and athers elected by Senate members) are held at
 least every 4 ears. Oposition parties operate freely.
 The federal Government is responsible for such matters of state as security, jus-
 tice, social security, and fiscal and monetary policy. The regional governments are
 charged with undertakings that directly affect the geograplucal region and the ma-
 terial well-being of its residents, such as commerce and trade, public works, and en-
 virnmental policy. The linguistic community councils handle matters more directly
 affecting the mental and cultural well-being of the individual, such as education and
 administration of certain social welfare programs.
 Women hold some high-level positions in the Government formed after the May
 1995 general elections. Two of 15 federal ministers are women. In the federal Par-
 liament, 18 of 150 House members and 18 of 71 Senators are women. The law re-
 quires that 33 percent of the candidates on the ballot in the next general election,
 to be held no later than 1999, be women.
 The existence of communities speaking Dutch, French, and German engenders
 significant complexities for the State. Most major institutions, including political
 parties, are divided along linquistic lines. National decisions often take into account
 the specific needs of each regional and linguistic group.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Numerous human rights groups operate without government restriction, inves-
 tigating and publishing their findings on human rights cases. Government officials
 are very cooperative and responsive to their views.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The law prohibits discrimination based on the listed factors, and the Government
 enforces it. With Dutch, French, and German as official languages, Belgium has a
 complex linguistic regime, including language requirements for various elected and
 appointed positions.
 Women. -The Government actively promotes a comprehensive approach to the in-
 tegration of women at all levels of decisionmaking. The Division of Equal Oppor-
 tunity, a part of the Ministry of Labor, focuses specifically on issues affecting
 women, including violence against women, sexual harassment, and the participation
 of women in the political process. Based on the resultv of the 1995 assessment of
 the effectiveness of two hot lines established in recent years to assist victims of sex-
 ual harassment, and the nature and volume of the calls that continue to come in,
 the Ministry of Labor continues to operate the French and Flemish hot lines.
 The law prohibits physical abuse of women, and the Government enforces this
 ban.
 The law prohibits organizing prostitution or assisting immigration for purposes of
 prostitution.
 Children.-Belgium has comprehensive child protection laws, which the Govern-
 ment seeks to enforce. The Francophone and Flemish communities have agencies
 dealing with children's needs. Government and private groups provide shelters for
 runaways and counseling for children who have been physically or sexually abused.
 The Government provides a compulsory education program up to the age of 18.
 In 1995 the Government enacted laws designed to repress the occurrence of child
 pornography by increasing penalties for those who commit such crimes and for those
 in possession of such materials. The law permits the Government to prosecute Bel-
 gians who commit such crimes abroad. Another 1995 law stated that criminals con-
 victed of sexual abuse of children cannot receive parole without first receiving spe-
 cialized assistance and must continue counseling and treatment upon release from
 prison.
 In August Belgian authorities uncovered a pedophile/child pornography and traf-
 ficking ring, the extent of which was still being investigated at ye as end. Police
 found two missing girls and the bodies of four others. They made 11 arrests in the
 case, but none of the suspects had come to trial by year's end. In response to allega-
 tions of corruption and complicity within the law enforcement and judicial system,
 including allegations that at least one policeman colluded with those charged in the
 case, the Ministry of Justice initiated several internal investigations into the con-
 
 
 duct of the investigation of child disappearances. Consistent with the strong govern-
 ment respnse to this case, parliamentary committees were examining the perform-
 ance of t   *e judicial community in this investigation and evaluating the need to re-
 form the judiciary. The policeman in question has been charged only in connection
 with the vehicle trafficking ring run by the same group. The Government had not
 released any results of these investigations by year's end
 The Government adopted a series of measures designed to strengthen its abilit
 to fight organized crime rings domestically and internationally; to make it more dif-
 ficult for those convicted of sexual crimes to be released from prisons early; and to
 create programs to support the victims and their families. Foreign Minister Erik
 Derycke made similar proposals at the World Congress Against the Commercial
 Sexual Exploitation of Children, which was held in Stockholm in August.
 Children have the right to a voice in court cases that affect them, such as divorce
 proceedings. The law states that a minor "capable of understanding" can request
 permission to be heard by a judge, or a judge can request an interview with a child.
 Child prostitution is of limited scope, but, in response to recommendations made in
 a 1994 government study, plice have received instructions to be especially diligent
 in combating prostitution o those who appear to be under the age of 18.
 There is no societal pattern of abuse directed against children.
 Peopie With Disabilities.-The laws provide protection from discrimination against
 disabled people in employment, education, and in the provision of other state serv-
 ices. The Government mandates that public buildings erected since 1970 be acces-
 sible to the disabled and offers subsidies to induce owners of other buildings to
 make necessary modifications. Many older buildings, however, are not accessible to
 the disabled.
 The Government provides financial assistance for the disabled. It offers special
 aid for parents of disabled children and for disabled parents. Regional and commu-
 nity programs provide other assistance, such as job training. Disabled persons are
 eligible to reeive servies in any of the three regions (landers, Wallonia, or Brus-
 sels), not just from the region in which they reside.
 NationallRacial/Ethnic Minorities.-Belgium is a pluralistic society in which in-
 dividual differences in general are respected and linguistic rights in particular are
 protected. Some 60 percent of citizens are native Dutch speakers; about 40 percent
 F reach speakers; and fewer than 1 percent German speakers.
 An Antiracism Law penalizes incitement of discrimination, hate, or violence based
 on race, ethnicity, or nationality. It is illegal for providers of goods or services (in-
 cluding housing) to discriminate on the basis of any of these factors and for employ-
 ers to consider these factors in their decisions to hire, train, or dismiss people.
 The Center for Equal Opportunity and the Fight Against Racism, a parliamentary
 organization tasked with investigating complaints of discrimination based on race,
 handled 1,120 calls asking for information in the first 10 months of 1995. Some 644
 of these calls were to make actual complaints, leading to court action in only 8
 cases. Statistics for 1996 are not yet available.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Under the Constitution, workers have the right to
 associate freely. This includes freedom to organize and join unions of their own
 choosing. The Government does not hamper such activities, and workers in fact fully
 and freely exercise their right of association. About 60 percent of the work force are
 members of labor unions. This number includes employed and unemployed workers.
 Retired workers are considered to be in the work force. Unions are independent of
 the Government but have important links with major political parties. As the Gov-
 ernment does not require unions to register, there are no prohibitions against
 antiunion actions before registration.
 Unions have the right to strike, and strikes by civil servants and workers in "es-
 sential" services are tolerated. The teachers, railway workers, and airport workers
 held strikep without government intimidation. Despite government irritation over
 wildcat strikes by air traffic controllers, no strikers were prosecuted. There were a
 number of significant labor strikes and work stoppages in 1996. (Ministry of Labor
 data indicate 45 strikes in 1995 with no data available for 1996.) Even though many
 strikes begin as wildcat actions, strikers are not prosecuted for conducting illegal
 - strikes.
 The International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) in its "Annual
 Survey of Violations of Trade Union Rights 1996" noted a 1995 practice of using
 civil court rulings to end strikes. The ICFTU report stated that the rulings include
 a threat of fines against strikers. After noting that these rulings had been made
 without giving a hearing to the unions, the ICFTU report concluded that such rul-
 ings call into question the free exercise of the right to strike. The ICFTU report ac-
 
 
 863
 knowledged government efforts to solve this problem but also cited an assessment
 of the Socialist Trade Union Confederation that "nothing had come of the Govern-
 ment's commitment." On the other hand, there was a sharp decrease in the number
 of this kind of court ruling starting in late 1995 and throughout 1996. This develop-
 ment is a result of labor/management talks in 1996, which brokered an informal
 agreement to minimize court rulings in exchange for less secondary boycott activity
 by the unions.
 Unions are free to form or join federations or confederations and are free to affili-
 ate with international labor bodies.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The right to organize and
 bargain collectively is recognized, protected, and exercised freely. Every other year
 the Belgian Employers Federation and unions negotiate a nationwide collective bar-
 gaining agreement, covering 2.4 million private sector workers, that establishes the
 framework for negotiations at plants and branches. Public sector workers also nego-
 tiate collective bargaining agreements. Collective bargaining agreements apply
 equally to union and nonunion members, and over 90 percent of workers are thus
 under collective bargaining agreements. As part of the Government's global eco-
 nomic reform plan, wage increases in both private and public sectors remain sus-
 pended, but this did not affect Belgium's wage indexation policy. This policy permits
 an across-the-board wage increase to keep workers' pay level with inflation.
 The law prohibits discrimination against organizers and members of unions and
 protects against termination of contracts of members -of workers' councils, members
 of health or safety committees, and shop stewards. Employers found guilty of
 antiunion discrimination are required to reinstate workers fired for union activities.
 Effective mechanisms such as the labor courts exist for adjudicating disputes be-
 tween labor and management.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced or compulsory labor is ille-
 gal and does not occur. Domestic workers and all other workers have the same
 rights as nondomestic workers. The Government enforces laws against those who
 seek to employ undocumented foreign workers.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The minimum age for employment
 of children is 15, but schooling is compulsory until the age of 18. Youth between
 the ages of 15 and 18 may participate in part-time work/study programs and may
 work full time during school vacations. The labor courts effectively monitor compli-
 ance with national laws and standards. There are no industries where any signifi-
 cant child labor exists.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-In May the monthly national minimum wage
 rate for workers over 21 years of age was set at $1,432 (43,665 Belgian francs); 18-
 year-olds must be paid at least 82 percent of the minimum, 19-year-olds 88 percent,
 and 20-year-olds 94 percent. The minimum wage rate, coupled with Belgium's exten-
 sive social benefits, provides workers with a standard of living appropriate to a
 highly developed nation. Minimum wages in the private sector are set in biennial
 nationwide collective bargaining (see Section 6.b.), which leads to formal agreements
 signed in the National Labor Council and made mandatory by royal decree for the
 entire private sector. In the public sector, the minimum wage is determined in nego-
 tiations between the Government and the public service unions. The Ministry of
 Labor effectively enforces the law regarding minimum wages. By law the standard
 workweek cannot exceed 40 hours and must have at least one 24-hour rest period.
 Many collective bargaining agreements set standard workweeks of 36 to 39 hours.
 The law requires overtime pay for hours worked in excess of the standard. Work
 done from the 9th to the 11th hour per day or from the 40th to the 50th hour per
 week is considered allowable overtime. Longer workdays are permitted only if
 agreed upon in a collective bargaining agreement. These laws/regulations are en-
 forced effectively by the Ministry of Labor and the labor courts.
 Comprehensive provisions for worker safety are mandated by law. Collective bar-
 gaining agreements can supplement these laws. Workers have the right to remove
 themselves from situations that endanger their safety or health, without jeopardy
 to their continued employment, and the law protects workers who file complaints
 about such situations. The Labor Ministry implements health and safety legislation
 through a team of inspectors and determines whether workers qualify for disability
 and medical benefits. Health and safety committees are mandated by law in compa-
 nies with more than 50 employees. Labor courts monitor effectively compliance with
 national health and safety laws and standards.
