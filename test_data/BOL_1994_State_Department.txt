 BOLIVIA
 A multiparty democracy with an elected president and bicameral legislature, Bo-
 livia has separate executive, legislative, and judicial branches with an attorney gen-
 eral independent of all three. In August the Congress approved constitutional
 amendments affecting election of future presidents and congresses, lowering the vot-
 ing age reforming the judicial system, and creating a human rights ombudsman of-
 ice and a court ofconstitutionality.
 The Army, Air Force, Navy, and National Police (including the UMOPAR rural
 mobile patrols) comprise the security forces. They are generally responsible to the
 civilian authorities, but some elements of the security forces committed incidents of
 human rights abuse.
 Rich in minerals and hydrocarbons, Bolivia has a per capita gross domestic prod-
 uct of about $1,000; 55 percent of its inhabitants live below the poverty line. Many
 Bolivians lack services such as water, power, sewage, and elementary health care,
 while traditional agricultural practices and weak infrastructure make poverty en-
 demic in rural areas. The Government stressed debt reduction, exports, foreign in-
 vestment, privatization, and a freer banking system to promote development. Real
 economic growth was estimated at about 4 percent in 1994, the same as 1993.
 The most pervasive human rights abuse continued to be prolonged incarceration
 of detainees caused by inefficiency and corruption in the judicial system. The Gov-
 ernment's efforts to combat wellentrenched and violent drug traffickers produced
 some abuses, including an extrajudicini killing, thefts, and  g-related corruption.
 Other abuses included mistreatment of detainees and prisoners (exacerbated by fail-
 ure to punish perpetrators), substandard prison conditions, violence and discrimina-
 tion against women and indigenous people, and inhuman working conditions in the
 mining industry.
 
 
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of politically
 motivated killings. There were two documented cases in which government forces
 committed extrajudicial killings. In one, a patrol of soldiers under a junior officer
 beat to death a Spanish citizen following an argument. At the urging of the Foreign
 Ministry, the armed forces investigated the officer and five soldiers were at year's
 end on trial for murder in a civilian court. In another case, on August 18, an
 UMOPAR patrol killed a cocaine laboratory worker, Felipe Perez Ortiz, during a
 counternarcotics operation in the coca-growing Chapare region. Initial police reports
 indicated Perez died in a gun battle but further investigation showed he died in
 custody from a gunshot to the head. he members of the patrol were detained; the
 policeman suspected of the actual shooting, however, 'escaped" September 3 under
 circumstances not yet clarified. The guards on duty at the time of the escape were
 arrested but have not yet been tried.
 Following a 7-year trial in absentia for murder, human rights abuses, and other
 crimes, in April 1993 the court sentenced former dictator General Luis Garcia Meza
 to the maximum 30-year prison term. Brazilian authorities arrested Garcia Meza
 and approved a Bolivian extradition request in 1994, but his lawyers appealed, and
 Brazi had not returned him to Bolivian custody by the end of the year.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The constitutional prohibition on torture is generally honored. There were, never-
 theless, credible charges of cruel and degrading treatment of detainees and pris-
 oners by police and prison personnel, particularly in connection with a major coca
 eradication effort in the Chapare region. The Government sent an investigatory
 team there, but no security personnel were tried for such acts; lack of evidence and
 fear prevented cases from going to trial. Some rural leaders exaggerated reports of
 UMOPAR abuses, making it hard to distingish between legitimate complaints and
 political agitation. In the past, however, there were credible reports of UMOPAR
 mistreatment of detainees (e.g., pushing, kicking). Allegations of more serious
 abuses, such as rape, could not be confirmed. UMOPAR has augmented the human
 rights component of its training.
 Allegations also resurfaced that ex-officers in police intelligence had in past years
 tortured captured terrorists. The congressional human rights committee inves-
 tigated the charges but announced no conclusions. The accusations seem politically
 motivated and not credible.
 Prison conditions vary from luxurious to wretched. Ability to pay can determine
 cell size, visiting privileges, day-pass eligibility, sentence, and place of confinement.
 Cell prices range from $20 to $5,000, paid to prior occupants or to prisoners who
 control cell blocks. In the poorest parts of La Paz' San Pedro prison, for example,
 inmates occupy tiny cells (3 by 4 by 6 feet) with no ventilation, lighting, or beds.
 Crowding in some 'low-rent" sections obliges inmates to sleep sitting up. Children
 up to 6 years old may live with an incarcerated parent; authorities have worked to
 get children out of prisons, but many have nowhere else to go. A member of the Bo-
 livian Permanent Assembly for Human Rights (APDHB) asserted that approxi-
 mately 400 children live with their parents in prison. Well-financed drug traffickers
 and terrorists often enjoy relatively lavish accommodations and visiting rights.
 Chonchocoro prison, outside La Paz, is built to hold the most dangerous criminals.
 These, however, often have means to get transfers, for 'medical" reasons, to less se-
 cure facilities.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Denial of justice through prolonged de-
 tention remains the most pervasive human rights problem. Judicial corruption, a
 shortage of public defenders, inadequate case-tracking mechanisms, and complex
 criminal justice procedures keep persons incarcerated for months, or even years, be-
 fore trial. Some estimates claim that up to 85 percent of inmates have yet to go to
 trial. The Constitution provides for 'udicial determination of the legality of deten-
 tion. Prisoners are released if a judge rules detention illegal, but the process can
 take months. Prisoners may see a lawyer, but public defenders are overburdened.
 Bail exists, except in some drug cases, and is generally granted. Many persons, how-
 ever, cannot afford it. Persons tried under Law 1008 (the counternarcotics law) must
 await Supreme Court confirmation or rejection of lower courts' verdicts-a process
 involving severe delays.
 Acuittal does not guarantee release from prison. Thousands remain in jail for
 months or even years after receiving "not guilty" verdicts because they cannot pay
 for release papers, other forms, and lawyers fees. The Government has begun to ad-
 dress the problem of delay of justice, including constitutional reforms to streamline
 
 
 329
 the judicial system. The Minister of Justice vowed to fre those who have spent long
 periods imprisoned without trial or were found not guilty but stay incarcerated for
 inability to pay fees and fines. At his urging, the legislature approved a government
 proposal to end imprisonment for debt. (The law had provided that debtors may be
 imprisoned until they pay civil damages, as well as court costs and fees.) The Gov-
 ernment freed some 300 persons by year's end, some of whom served as many as
 10 years in prison for debts as small as $50.
 Exile is not used as a punishment.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution provides for the right to a fair
 public trial, and the authorities generally respect it. Investigation, trial, and appeal
 procedures however, take so long that prisoners can serve more time than the sen-
 tence for the crime with which they are charged. Defendants have the right to an
 attorney to confront witnesses, to present evidence, and to appeal judicial decisions.
 The authorities generally honor these rights. Although the law provides for a de-
 fense attorney at public expense if needed, one is not always available. The highly
 formal and corrupt judicial system makes it difficult for poor, illiterate persons to
 have access to courts and legal redress.
 Corruption and intimidation in the judicial system remain major problems. Poor
 pay and working conditions help make judges and prosecutors susceptible to bribes
 to free suspected drug traffickers and their property. In July the acting Attorney
 General, under circumstances that suggested strongly he had been bribed or threat-
 ened, recommended against the extradition of several traffickers. After a long im-
 peachment trial in Congress, two Supreme Court justices, including the Court's
 president, were found guilty of malfeasance and removed from the Court.
 APBDH, the major local human rights group, asserted that there were about 20
 "political prisoners," but the Government claimed they were terrorists involved in
 violent crimes, including murders and bombings. Available evidence supported the
 Government's claim.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution provides for the sanctity of the home and the privacy of citizens' lives,
 and the Government usually respected these provisions. There were credible allega-
 tions of UMOPAR abuses, including thefts of property from homes and illegal
 searches. Opponents charged that security services conducted illegal phone taps and
 other surveillance; these charges could not be confirmed. The Government respects
 the rights of individuals to determine family size, religion, and political affiliations.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-No legal or institutional barriers to freedom of
 speech and press exist. State-owned and private radio and television stations oper-
 ate freely. News apers are privately owned; most adopt antigovernment positions.
 There were credible charges of politicians and drug traffickers paying newsmen for
 favorable coverage, even though professional organizations rejected such accusa-
 tions.
 The Government respects academic freedom, and the law grants public univer-
 sities autonomous status. Some university-based Marxist groups seek to deny aca-
 demic freedom and impose theirplitical agenda on the education process. They
 have threatened to paralyze the educational system to protest the Government's re-
 form plan, which moves resources from the universities to primary education.
 b. Freedom of Peacefud Assembly and Association.-The law provides for the rights
 of peaeful assembly and association, and the authorities respect them in practice.
  itical, and student groups carried out numerous demonstrations and ral-
 lies in La Paz and other cities. As a rule, authorities try to avoid confronting dem-
 onstratrs. The Government routinely gted permits for marches and rallies.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-Roman Catholicism predominates; the Constitution rec-
 ognizes it as the official religion. Citizens may practice the religion of their choice.
 Aout 400 religious groups, mostly Protestant, are active. Missionary groups must
 register with the Foreign Ministry as nongovernmental organizations (NE's); no
 indication exists that they received treatment different from that given other NGO's.
 Despite Catholic Church criticism, the Ministry disallowed no registrations.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-No restrictions exist on travel. The Government permits emigration,
 guarantees the right to return, and does not revoke citizenship for political reasons.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Bolivia is a multiparty democracy with an elected president and an independent,
 bicameral legislature. Political parties ranging from far left to moderate right fimc-
 tion openly. National elections are held every 4 years; the June 1993 elections were
 
 
 330
 free and fair, resulting in a peaceful, constitutional change of government. Suffrage
 is universal and obligatory.
 No legal impediments exist to women or indigenous people voting, holding politi-
 cal office, or rising to political leadership. Nevertheless, the number of women and
 indigenous people who have prominent positions in politics remains small, but with
 notable exceptions such as Vice President Victor Hugo Cardenas, an Aymara Indian,
 and La Paz mayor Monica Medina. The "popular participation" law passed in April
 will give local communities more influence in decisionmaking. Its impact has been
 greatest in rural areas, where neighbors formed 1,500 basic territorial organizations
 and small communities created 47 centralized municipal associations, which have
 legal status to receive and spend public funds, largely on local development projects.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The Government is sensitive to the views of domestic and international human
 rights organizations and discusses their concerns with them. Amnesty International,
 Human Rights Watchl Americas, and the Washington Office on Latin America fol-
 low the local human rights scene; monitors have visited without hindrance. The
 House of Deputies' Human Rights Commission gets considerable political and media
 attention. The Catholic Church, the APDHB, foreign NGO's, labor and student orga-
 nizations, and the media monitor human rights issues. As part of a large
 counternarcotics operation, the Government expelled two foreign human rights mon-
 itors for immigration law violations, involvement with pro-coca activities and
 groups, and possible links to terrorists. The Government's accusations were credible;
 there was no evidence that they were expelled because of human rights activities.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution prohibits discrimination based upon race, sex, language, religion,
 political or other opinion, origin, or economic or social condition. Nonetheless, there
 is significant discrimination against women and indigenous people.
 Women.-Women generally do not enjoy a social status equal to that of men.
 Many poor women do not know their legal rights; traditional prejudices and social
 conditions remain obstacles to advancement. Women generally earn less than men
 for equal work. Young girls often leave school to work at home or on the economy.
 A study by the National Statistical Institute (INE) found that, as of the 1992 cen-
 sus, 27.7 percent of women were illiterate, compared to 11.8 percent of men. Al-
 though no-egal impediments exist, women hold few professional positions.
 Violence against women is pervasive. An INE study covering the July 1992-June
 1993 period found that 40 percent of all reported violent attacks in La Paz depart-
 ment were perpetrated against women. Ninety-five percent of the attackers were
 male; in 71 percent of the cases the attacker was closely related to the victim. Of
 these domestic violence complaints, 52 percent involved physical mistreatment and
 48 percent were related to psychological abuse. A total of 11,069 complaints of vio-
 lence against women were registered in La Paz during this period. The Subsecretary
 for Women's Affairs in the Ministry of Human Development estimates that 95 per-
 cent of all cases of violence against women go unpunished. Women's rights advo-
 cates point out that the Penal Code provides that no punishment is applicable when
 "i juries are light" and were inflicted by a close family member (including in-laws)
 living with the victim.
 The Government has developed a four-part plan for the protection of women. It
 implemented the first part on October 24 by promulgating Law 1559 which adopted
 the Inter-American Convention for the Prevention, Punishment, and Eradication of
 Violence Against Women as Bolivian law. Subsequent steps include a law against
 domestic violence, establishment of comprehensive legal services offices to help and
 support women, revisions to school curriculums, and educating health care providers
 about the appropriate manner of dealing with female patients.
 Children.-According to the Subsecretary for Generational Affairs of the Ministry
 of Human Development, approximately 40 percent of the urban population under 18
 years of age (about one Million persons) is mistreated; he estimated that the propor-
 tion is higher in rural areas. Statistics from the Ministry of Planning's education
 reform team note that in rural areas, only 0.7 percent of girls and 1.4 percent of
 boys finish high school; in urban areas, 26 percent of girls and 31 percent of boys
 do so. The 1994 Educational Reform Act seeks to better the situation of children;
 even optimistic observers, however, note the reforms will need years to make an im-
 pact.
 The old practice of "criadito" service still persists in some parts of Bolivia.
 Criaditos are indigenous children of both sexes, usually 10 to 12 years old, whom
 
 
 their parents indenture to middle- and upper-class families to perform household
 work m exchange for education, clothing, room, and board. There are no controls
 over the benefits to or treatment of the criaditos, who may become virtual slaves
 for the years of their indenture.
 Indigenous People.-Indians, who comprise a majority of the population, lack the
 oportunity to participate in decisions affecting their lands, culture, traditions, and
 the allocation of natural resources. The Government has placed rights for indige-
 nous people on its reform agenda, which includes educational reform and Iopulr
 participation. The  1994   constitutional reforms  acknowledge  Bolivia  as  a
 "multiethnic, pluricultural society" and allow the indigenous nations to assume own-
 ership of traditional lands. By year's end, however, few if any results were apparent.
 Discrimination against and abuses of indigenous people continued. The Indian
 majority generally remains at the low end of the socioeconomic scale, facing severe
 disadvantages in health, life e     cy, education, income, literacy, and employ-
 ment. Lack of education, poor farming and mining methods, indigenous cultural
 practices, inability to speak Spanish, and societal biases keep the indigenous people
 poor. Construction workers, mostly indigenous, are often fired before 3 months serv-
 ice, relieving the employer of the obligation to provide severance pay and other ben-
 efits. The same employer then rehires the workers for another short period.
 People With Disabilities.-No specific legislation protects the disabled but some
 limited steps have been taken: for example, the new electoral law makes arrange-
 ments for blind voters. In general, however, there are no special services nor infra-
 structure to accommodate the handicapped. Social attitudes keep many disabled
 persons at home from an early age, limiting their integration into society.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Wokers may form and join organizations of their
 choosing. The Labor Code requires prior governmental authorization to establish a
 union, permits only one per enterprise, and allows the Government to dissolve
 unions, but the Government has not enforced these provisions in recent years. While
 the Code denies civil servants the right to organize and bans strikes in public serv-
 ices, including banks and public markets, nearly all civilian government workers are
 unionized. In theory, the Bolivian Labor Federation (COB) represents virtually the
 entire work force; approximately one-half of the workers in the formal economy be-
 long to labor unions. Some members of the informal economy also participate in
 labor organizations. Workers in the private sector frequently exercise the right to
 strike. Solidarity strikes are illegal, but the Government does not prosecute those
 responsible nor impose penalties.
 Significant strikes centered around annual negotiations over salaries and benefits
 for public employees. When the Government refused to accede to union demands,
 striers marched, set up roadblocks, and cut access to certain areas of the Chapare
 region. Additional talks produced a settlement favorable to the workers, and the
 strikes ended. Unions are not independent of government and political parties. Most
 parties have labor committees that try to influence union activity, causing fierce po-
 litical battles within unions. The law allows unions to join international labor orga-
 nizations. The COB became an affiliate of the formerly Soviet-dominated World Fed-
 eration of Trade Unions (WFTU) in 1988.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Workers may organize and
 bargain collectively. n practice, collective bargaining, defined as voluntary direct
 negotiations between unions and employers without participation of the Govern-
 ment, is limited. Consultations between government representatives and labor lead-
 ers are common, but there are no collective bargaining agreements as defined above.
 In state industries, the union issues a list of demands and the Government concedes
 some points. Private employers often use public sector settlements as guidelines for
 their own a~justments, and some private employers exceed what the Government
 grants. The Government, conscious of International Monetary Fund guidelines, rare-
 ly grants wage increases exceeding inflation.
 The law prohibits discrimination against union members and organizers. Com-
 plaints go to the National Labor Court, which can take a year or more to rule.
 Union leaders say problems are often moot by the time the court rules.
 Labor law and practice in the seven special duty-free zones are the same as in
 the rest of Bolivia.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The law bars forced or compulsory
 labor. There were no cases reported other than the criadito service described in Sec-
 tion 5.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The law prohibits employment of
 persons under 18 years of age in dangerous, unhealthy, or immoral work. The Labor
 Code is ambiguous on conditions of employment for minors aged 14 to 17; it permits
 
 
 332
 apprenticeship for those 12 to 14. This practice has been criticized by the Inter-
 national Labor Organization- the Government responded that it would present legis-
 lation reforming this and otler provisions of the Labor Code. Responsibility for en-
 forcing child labor provisions resides in the Labor Ministry, but it generally does
 not enforce provisions on employment of children. Urban children hawk goods, shine
 shoes, and assist transport operators. Rural children often work with parents from
 an early age. Children are not generally employed in factories or formal businesses
 but, when employed, often work the same hours as adults.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work-The law establishes a minimum wage (about
 $38 per month), bonuses, and fringe benefits. The minimum wage does not provide
 a worker a decent standard of living, and most workers earn more. Although the
 minimum wage falls below prevailing wages in most jobs, certain fringe benefits are
 pegged to it. The minimum wage does not cover about 20 percent of urban work-
 ers-vendors and shoe polishers, for example-nor does it cover farmers, some 30
 percent of the working population.  .
 Only half the urban a or force enjoys an 8-hour workday and a workweek of 5
 or 5/c days, because the maximum workweek of 44 hours is not enforced. The Labor
 Ministry's Bureau of Occupational Safety has responsibility for protection of work-
 ers' health and safety, but such laws are poorly enforced. Although the State Mining
 Corporation has an office charged with safety, the mines, often old and using anti-
 quated equipment, are dangerous and unhealthy.
 In a tradition dating from the Spanish conquest, employers in the mining sector
 promote chewing of coca leaf with a catalyst that serves to release the leafs alka-
 loids, including cocaine. Coca is promoted as a substitute for food, water, and appro-
 priate rest periods. In many cooperative mines, miners earn less than $3 per 12-
 hour day. They work without helmets, boots, or respirators in mines where toxic
 gases abound; they buy their own supplies, including dynamite, have no scheduled
 rest periods, and survive with little water and food. Employers and others assure
 them coca leaf satisfies not only nutritional needs but also suppresses hunger and
 thirst, makes them strong, and protects them from toxic gases and silicosis. Miners
 stay underground from 24 to 72 hours without interruption. With no drinking water
 available in many mines, miners drink urine. The promotion of coca chewing by
 some employers, politicians, the COB, and persons having a financial stake in the
 manufacture and sale of cocaine, contributes to conditions of work that fall far below
 international labor and human rights standards.
