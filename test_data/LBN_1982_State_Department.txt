 LEBANON
 Lebanon is a parliamentary democracy shaped to reflect the
 numerous religious groups which occupy its territory. To a
 constitution based on the French model of the late 19th
 century, which created the executive and the legislature, is
 added the tradition of confessionalism: the representation of
 religious communities in the Government.
 The Lebanese economy is one of the freest in the world. It is
 marked by the almost total absence of government intervention..
 Many of the services normally provided by governments elsewhere
 are provided by private institutions. Although income is
 relatively high for the region, there are wide disparities
 between urban and rural incomes. Nevertheless, there is a
 large middle class based on commerce and services. In recent
 years, internal migration to Beirut has led to the expansion of
 urban poverty, particularly among Muslims.
 Lebanon traditionally has shown a high regard for human rights,
 but its ability to enforce respect for these rights has been
 severely limited in recent years by internecine warfare and the
 use of its territory by foreign regular and irregular military
 forces. This has reduced greatly the area of the country under
 the Government's effective control.
 During 1982, a series of major events took place which had a
 significant impact on human rights in Lebanon: a) the Israeli
 invasion of Lebanon in early June and the subsequent'siege of
 Beirut by Israeli forces; b) the evacuation of Palestine
 Liberation Organization (PLO) and Syrian forces from Beirut; c)
 the election of Bashir Gemayel as President of Lebanon and his
 subsequent assassination; d) the Israeli invasion of Beirut; e)
 the election of Amin Gemayel as President; and f) the
 withdrawal of Israeli forces from Beirut and the re-imposition
 of Lebanese authority in the city.
 Beginning with the civil war of 1975-76, a situation developed
 in Lebanon in which human rights were routinely violated,
 sometimes on a massive scale. During this seven-year period,
 the Lebanese Government was able to exercise very little
 control over the country, and fighting among private militias
 as well as with and between occupying forces caused heavy
 civilian casualties. In addition, kidnapping, intimidation and
 summary executions have been common. Some of the private
 militias received outside support, notably from Syria, Israel,
 Iraq, and Iran. Non-political crime has also been rampant.
 Against this background, there has been a general lawlessness
 which affects much of the country. Personal scores are often
 settled through violence, and, especially in areas not under
 the control of the Lebanese Government (all of Lebanon, except
 Beirut), criminal acts are often pursued under the cover of
 political action.
 Major changes in the human rights picture in Lebanon took place
 in 1982. As during the past seven years, clashes among
 Lebanese militias, Syrian forces in Lebanon, and the PLO
 created widespread abuses of human rights. Beginning in June,
 the Israeli invasion drastically altered the situation. PLO
 and Syrian influence was eliminated in Beirut and south
 Lebanon, but Israeli actions also led to abuses. In addition
 to violations by the Israelis in areas under their control, the
 
 
 1196
 Lebanese Government itself was responsible for serious abuses
 as it reasserted its control over West Beirut.
 Long or short-term trends in human rights in Lebanon will
 depend to a large degree on current attempts to resolve the
 conflicts which have destabilized the country for seven years.
 The withdrawal of all foreign forces from Lebanon and the
 consequent establishment of government authority and control
 over all Lebanese territory should lead, among other things, to
 the demilitarization of Lebanese political factions and an
 improvement in the human rights situation. At present, it is
 important to bear in mind in any discussion of human rights in
 Lebanon that the Government has very little effective control
 outside of Beirut.
 1.   Respect for the Integrity of the Person Including
 Freedom from:
 a.   Killing
 The Lebanese Government has asserted that 19,800 Lebanese and
 Palestinian civilians were killed as a result of the Israeli
 invasion of Lebanon. The fighting between Israeli and
 Palestinian and other forces during the summer also resulted in
 significant destruction to certain civilian areas, as heavy
 weaponry and aerial bombardment were frequently used by Israel
 in attacks upon targets in urban and other populated areas. In
 particular, the vast majority of casualties occurred in West
 Beirut as a result of the two-month Israeli siege of the city.
 The Government is quick to point out, however, that accurate
 casualty figures are very difficult to compile in view of
 extensive destruction of buildings, whose uncleared rubble may
 cover corpses. Dozens of persons died during the year as the
 result of bombs used for terrorism and assassination by a
 variety of groups, in some cases with Syrian backing. The most
 serious of these was the September 14 bomb assassination of
 President-elect Bashir Gemayel and 26 other persons at a
 Phalange Party headquarters in East Beirut. Following
 Gemayel's assassination and the subsequent Israeli invasion of
 West Beirut, Lebanese militiamen, in an operation coordinated
 with the Israelis, entered the Palestinian refugee camps of
 Sabra and Shatila in West Beirut. The militiamen perpetrated a
 massacre of hundreds of civilians. The Government found the
 bodies of 328 victims of the massacre; several hundred more
 probably remain unlocated. A commission of inquiry has been
 established by the Government of Lebanon. It has not published
 results of the inquiry. The Israeli Government has undertaken
 its own investigation of the massacre.
 In October, during protests by Lebanese shi'a Muslims
 against the Government's destruction of illegal structures in
 West Beirut, Lebanese army personnel fired on the
 demonstrators, killing at least one person and perhaps as many
 as five. On November 19, a wounded Palestinian prisoner was
 killed in Gaza Hospital, in West Beirut, by brutal treatment
 from a soldier of the Lebanese Armed Forces.
 Dozens, perhaps hundreds, of civilians were killed in 1982 in
 clashes between militia forces elsewhere in Lebanon. Fighting
 in Tripoli resulted in numerous casualties early in the year
 and occasional outbreaks of violence in the Shuf mountains
 between Christian and Druze forces claimed the lives of dozens
 of civilians. At least seven persons died in a series of
 assassinations and murders in April and May aimed at religious
 targets; it was widely believed, but not confirmed, that these
 deaths were the result of a Syrian campaign to stir up
 confessional strife.
 b.   Disappearance
 
 
 1197
 Disappearances following abduction are common occurrences in
 Lebanon. Responsibility is generally attributed to the various
 militia groups and non-Lebanese Government armed forces. For
 example, kidnapping was a significant element in the fighting
 in the Shuf mountains between Druze and Christian militias.
 There is no evidence that the Government participates in or
 condones these activities.
 Following the September massacre in the Sabra and Shatila
 camps, Lebanese authorities declared that over 900 Palestinian
 refugees were 'missing.* Many of these may have been killed
 and their bodies never found. Some probably fled and have yet
 td return. There were also reports that many refugees were
 taken from the camps by rightist militiamen at the time of the
 massacre.
 Between 9,000 and 15,000 persons, mostly Palestinian but also
 including many Lebanese and other nationalities, were detained
 by the Israeli Defense Forces during Israel's invasion and
 subsequent occupation of southern Lebanon and Beirut. As of
 the end of 1982, the Red Cross still did not have access to all
 Israeli-held prisoners. During security sweeps by the Lebanese
 Armed Forces beginning in mid-September, over 2,000 persons
 were detained. Although half of the detainees were released
 after only a short time in custody, the names of the remaining
 detainees have not been made public by the Government. and for
 many of the detainees no outside access has been permitted.
 c.   Torture
 Government authorities have publicly stated that they do not
 sanction torture, but charges of torture have been made against
 the Government by various political factions as well as by
 Amnesty International and other human rights organizations.
 According to press reports, denied by the Government, four
 Palestinians detained by the Lebanese army in mid-September
 died as a result of torture. There is strong evidence that the
 private militias, which operate outside of the control of the
 central Government, have tortured captured opponents. For
 example, mutilated bodies are found occasionally in virtually
 all parts of Lebanon, and some bodies found in the
 Sabra/Shatila camps showed evidence of torture. There have
 been various allegations, including some in the Israeli press,
 of torture or brutal treatment of Israeli-held prisoners during
 interrogation.
 d.   Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 The treatment of prisoners, whether held by private militia
 groups, foreign armies in Lebanon, or the Government, is not
 good. Arrests by various militia groups have involved rough
 treatment and torture and have resulted in summary executions
 on occasion. Since the Israeli invasion in June 1982, a
 variety of groups and individuals have charged the Israelis
 with abuses in their treatment of the thousands of prisoners
 taken in the course of the invasion and afterward. The
 majority of these prisoners were Palestinian. Conditions at
 the Israeli prison camp in Ansar (south Lebanon) were
 reportedly quite bad with severe overcrowding, inadequate
 shelter, unhealthy sanitation, and lack of effective medical
 care. Living conditions at Ansar improved as 1982 went on, but
 remain unsatisfactory. Communication between prisoners and
 families was generally not permitted. In September, Israeli
 guards at Ansar reportedly fired on prisoners attempting to see
 family members gathered outside the camp perimeter and wounded
 
 
 1198
 eight. In December, three Ansar prisoners were killed in
 another incident of firing by guards.
 During the Lebanese Government's search and arrest operations
 in West Beirut in fall 1982, such a large number of people were
 arrested that, due to the severe shortage of prison space,
 conditions under which the detainees were held were poor. Some
 prisoners were apparently beaten at the time of arrest, and it
 is probable that the Government used the threat of violence, if
 not actual violence, during interrogation of prisoners.
 Numerous press reports, alleged that these Government-held
 prisoners were subjected to brutal treatment, and, in the
 absence of outside access to all the prisoners, it is difficult
 to verify the charges. Amnesty International publicly
 expressed concern over alleged ill-treatment of prisoners
 detained in Lebanon by both Israel and the Lebanese Government.
 e.   Arbitrary Arrests and Imprisonment
 Hundreds of arbitrary arrests have been carried out over the
 years by private militias and military forces occupying
 Lebanon. There is no way accurately to estimate the number of
 prisoners who might still be held by private militias. From
 9,000 to 15,000 persons, primarily Palestinian but also
 including thousands of Lebanese and hundreds of other
 nationalities, were detained without charge by the Israelis.
 Various accounts, including at least one in the Israeli press,
 contend that many of the prisoners were not suspected of any
 direct involvement in military or terrorist activities.
 Persons who were old, crippled, or blind allegedly were
 included-among these prisoners. Approximately 5,300 persons
 remained in the Israeli-run Ansar camp as of the end of 1982.
 In the course of efforts to reassert Lebanese Government
 authority in West Beirut in October, the Lebanese army
 conducted extensive search and arrest operations focused
 primarily on undocumented or illegal aliens. More than 2,000
 people were taken into custody, roughly half of whom were
 Palestinians. Well over a thousand have been released, but at
 year's end the Government had yet to make a decision regarding
 the status of the remainder.
 In October the Syrian Government released nine members of the
 Lebanese Phalange Party whom it had detained in Lebanon. Six
 of them had been held since 1978, the others since 1980; the
 Syrians are believed to be still holding other Lebanese
 prisoners.
 f.   Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Law, past practice, and custom afford the right to a fair trial
 by an independent judiciary, but conditions in Lebanon have
 been such that judges occasionally are unwilling to pass
 judgment or sentences for fear of personal reprisal. This, as
 well as the shortage of judges, can delay trials. Late in 1982
 the Government made a concerted effort to resume the operations
 of its court system in several parts of the country, including
 some areas under militia or Syrian control. The number of
 criminal and civil trials held increased correspondingly.
 Ultimately, however, the disposition of a case rests in the
 hands of the group in power in the particular district, rather
 than in the court system. No legal recourse in Lebanon is
 available to Israeli-held prisoners in the Ansar camp.
 g.   Invasion of the Home
 The Lebanese Constitution states that the domicile is
 inviolable and that no one may enter it except in cases
 provided by the law and according to the form it prescribes.
 In theory, this means that Lebanese Government authorities must
 acquire the equivalent of a warrant to enter homes. In areas
 
 
 1199
 over which the Government has no control, homes are invaded
 routinely by private militias and foreign armies. In East
 Beirut, where the Lebanese Government has recently taken
 control, there has been a public outcry against the search of
 residences without warrants, conducted by the Lebanese army,
 and the demolition of illegal structures which served as homes
 for Lebanese and Palestinian refugees from south Lebanon.
 2.   Respect for Civil and Political Rights, Including:
 a.   Freedom of Speech and Press
 Present legislation empowers the Government to censor the press
 but is is not being implemented. There are no Government-owned
 newspapers, and the press freely criticizes the Government.
 Publications seldom print material objectionable to political
 groups in a position to exact retribution. Most publications
 are distributed freely and are even available in some areas
 hostile to their editorial viewpoints. Several illegal radio
 stations operated by individual militia groups broadcast
 without interference. During the period preceding the
 presidential elections in August 1982, there were reports of
 threats to the lives, families, and property of some
 parliamentary deputies in an effort to influence their
 actions. These efforts at intimidation were probably made both
 by the Syrians and allied groups and by elements backing the
 candidacy of Bashir Gemayel. After the election, the homes of
 at least seven deputies were destroyed in areas still occupied
 by Syrian forces.
 Following their occupation of Beirut, Israeli forces
 removed the entire archives, including historical documents and
 archeological relics, of the Institute for Palestine Studies,
 of the Palestine Research Center, and of various private
 individuals.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Government places no restrictions or limits on the right of
 free assembly. The only existing restrictions are those
 imposed by the private militias and occupying armies which
 control various parts of the country.
 There is a trade union movement. Laws grant the right to
 organize, strike, and bargain collectively. Lebanese labor law
 also provides for collective contracts, mediation, and
 arbitration. In theory, the unions should have considerable
 influence. Virtually all sectors of the work force are
 unionized; perhaps only five percent of the workers in Lebanon
 do not belong to unions. In practice, however, workers and the
 unions themselves are subject to pressure by militia groups and
 foreign armies, as are most other institutions and elements of
 the society. Strikes or threats to strike are carried out only
 with the acquiescence (or active backing) of the armed groups
 controlling any given area.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 In general, Lebanese can practice their religions freely.
 Prior to the 1975-76 fighting, accommodation among Lebanon's
 fourteen recognized faiths was a cornerstone of the unwritten
 covenant establishing the Lebanese state (the National Pact of
 1943). The 1975-76 civil war and subsequent unrest had strong
 religious undertones, however, and while no official or
 statutory restrictions on religious practice exist, members of
 one confession are often reluctant to travel into areas
 controlled by another.
 In spite of the troubles in recent years, religious coexistence
 is still common with the exception of some Christian-controlled
 areas from which almost all Muslims have departed. In many
 
 
 1200
 cases, religion and politics have become so inextricably mixed
 that an individual's religious affiliation is taken as an
 indication of his political leanings. During the fighting
 between Druze and Maronite militias in the mountains southeast
 of Beirut, kidnappings and killings on both sides occasionally
 were carried out solely on the basis of religious
 identification. Religious distinctions historically have been
 sharply drawn. They are embodied in arrangements which
 allocate Governmental and military positions and parliamentary
 seats on the basis of religious affiliation. Religious courts
 have jurisdiction over matters of personal status: marriage,
 divorce, inheritance, and guardianship. Religious law often
 discriminates against women.
 d.   Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Movement within the country traditionally has been free,
 subject to the practical consideration that large areas
 controlled by private militias, the Israelis, the Syrians and
 the PLO may be unsafe for members of some political and
 confessional groups. Foreign travel is not restricted. There
 is no impediment to voluntary repatriation.
 Lebanon throughout its history has been a land of asylum.
 Approximately 240,000 Palestinian refugees are registered with
 the UN Relief and Works Agency, and many other refugees are in
 the country without legal refugee status. Since September
 1982, the Government has begun to identify and arrest refugees
 and others who are in West Beirut without proper
 documentation. A few have been deported; hundreds (mainly
 Palestinians) remained in prison at the end of 1982.
 e.   Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 The character of the political system is multi-party. No party
 is outlawed. Some militant opposition parties can function
 freely only in areas which their adherents control militarily,
 or in "neutral' areas controlled by government forces. Most
 major political parties either have their own press or can get
 their views fully set forth in sympathetic newspapers.
 Political/military groups in the country, both Lebanese and
 foreign, have employed strong efforts--including
 intimidation--to influence the political process. The Lebanese
 army, in the course of its search and seizure operation in West
 Beirut in September and October 1982, closed the offices of
 certain leftist parties.
 Women have the same legal rights as men regarding political
 participation. Owing to cultural traditions, however, many
 women refrain from participating in the political process. For
 this reason, there are few women in the governing structure.
 3.   Government Attitude Regarding International and Non-
 governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations of
 Human Rights
 Throughout its history, Lebanon has been an important player in
 the international human rights arena. For example, former
 Foreign Minister Charles Malik played a leading role in the
 drafting of the United Nations Human Rights Declaration. The
 Lebanese have adhered to the following conventions on human
 rights: International Covenant on Economic, Social and
 Cultural Rights; International Covenant of Civil and Political
 Rights; Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the
 Crime of Genocide; International Convention on the Elimination
 of All Forms of Racial Discrimination; and the Convention on
 the Political Rights of Women.
 The Government itself has not been the subject of resolutions
 or investigations by official international organizations,
 
 
 1201
 although there have been numerous UN resolutions, targetted
 mostly at Israel, regarding the invasion and, later, the
 massacre in the refugee camps. The International Committee of
 the Red Cross maintains a large presence in Lebanon. Most of
 its activities are focused on areas under the control of the
 Israelis, Syrians, and PLO. There exists a small Beirut-based
 Committee for the Preservation of the Constitution and
 Liberties, which concerns itself with the observance of human
 rights in Lebanon and throughout the Middle.East. There are
 also individuals who take a personal interest in human rights.
 Their activities are generally limited to deploring the lack of
 government authority and intervening on the behalf of selected
 individual victims of actions by the private militias and
 foreign armies in Lebanon.
 4.   Economic, Social, and Cultural Situation
 The Lebanese traditionally have operated one of the freest
 economies in the world, even relying on the private sector to
 provide many of the social services which most Governments
 ordinarily supply. The Government is now increasing its
 programs in this area, providing relief and reconstruction
 assistance and low-cost loans. The main economic and social
 problems are the result of an absence of a political consensus
 and the internal security situation. People are reluctant to
 invest in long-term projects.
 Income is relatively high for the region, but is unevenly
 distributed. Disparities were wide between urban wealth and
 rural poverty, but urban poverty has also increased over the
 past two decades, largely as a result of rural immigration.
 There is a large, stable, and highly active middle class based
 on commerce and services. The tax system is progressive, but
 collection of direct taxes is difficult under present
 circumstances and accounts for only a small fraction of
 government revenues. Per capita income was estimated at $1,000
 in 1974. It declined during the 1975-76 civil war, but has
 since climbed to an estimated $2,200 in 1981 (Central Bank
 figures). Lack of statistics and the havoc wreaked by seven
 years of civil war and the Israeli invasion of summer 1982
 prevent an accurate analysis of welfare levels.
 Employment and educational opportunities for women, as well as
 their right to own property or operate businesses, are limited
 in some regions by religion and custom. In Beirut, many women
 hold responsible jobs in the private sector. There are no
 elected female officials at the national level and very few
 women serving as senior government officials.
 Property is privately owned and the right to property is
 protected in normal circumstances. However, the private
 militias, the Syrians, the PLO, and the Israelis have seized
 property frequently. Shelter has been a problem for refugees,
 both Palestinian and Lebanese, since the civil war began in
 1975. The Israeli invasion in 1982 created additional
 thousands of homeless, particularly among Palestinian
 refugees. A large-scale international effort was launched to
 provide basic shelter for many of the homeless. The Lebanese
 Government has sought to block international efforts to
 reconstruct permanent housing for the Palestinian refugees, but
 has allowed the UN to erect tents to protect the refugees.
 To try to ameliorate the housing shortage for Lebanese, the
 Government has established a program designed to assist
 low-income families to build and obtain housing, with
 particular emphasis on south Lebanon. The Government has
 sought funds from international donors to assist in the program
 and has committed funds pledged by Arab states to the housing
 sector.
 
 
 1202
 Adequate health care is generally available in urban areas from
 a well-developed but privately-funded health sector. The
 Government recognizes the need to improve existing
 Government-run facilities. Many public facilities were damaged
 during the civil war and the Israeli invasion and are not
 adequate in many areas. American University Hospital in Beirut
 accepts a small number of patients who are unable to pay for
 medical attention. Some international organizations are
 working with the Ministry of Health to improve administrative
 and management capabilities.
 Educational facilities are abundant, but the main burden is
 carried by private schools. If they can afford it, Lebanese
 educate their children in private schools at all levels, and
 over 50 percent of pre-university-level students attend private
 schools. Many private elementary schools enjoy substantial
 government subsidies. However, public education exists through
 the university level. The literacy rate in Lebanon varies from
 90-96 percent among Christians and Palestinians to as low as 30
 percent among Shi'a Muslims and non-Palestinian refugee
 groups. In addition, the Government supports vocational
 education in such areas as mechanics, television repair,
 aircraft maintenance, and other technical fields.
 Lack of an adequate administrative base hinders the fulfillment
 of many programs which would broaden shelter, educational, and
 health facilities and improve the general economic
 infra-structure. The Government is stepping up the pace of
 reconstruction with the assistance of the international
 community and private Lebanese philanthropists. The Council
 for Development and Reconstruction, established in 1977 under
 the former Ministry of Planning, has responsibility for drawing
 up and implementing Lebanon's program of economic and social
 recovery.
