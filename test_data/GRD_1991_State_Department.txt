 GRENADA
 Grenada's parliamentary form of government, with a Governor
 General as titular Head of State, was suspended in 1979 by the
 Marxist People's Revolutionary Government (PRG) and then
 restored in October 1983 following the joint U.S.-Caribbean
 intervention. The second postrevolutionary election was held
 on March 13, 1990, following the death'in December 1989 of
 Prime Minister Herbert Blaize who had prorogued Parliament in
 August 1989 rather than face a potential no confidence vote.
 In a free and fair election in March no political party
 received a clear majority. Following several days of
 inconclusive negotiations among the parties, the Governor
 General appointed as Prime Minister Nicholas Brathwaite, who
 successfully formed a majority government around the National
 Democratic Congress (NDC) parliamentarians.
 National security in Grenada is the responsibility of the
 600-member Royal Grenada Police Force (RGPF), which includes a
 75-man paramilitary Special Services Unit (SSU) and a '30-man
 coast guard unit. The RGPF and its elements are controlled by
 and responsive to civilian government authorities.
 Grenadians are free to pursue economic goals in a free market
 environment. Major improvements in infrastructure have.-
 accompanied economic growth, which has averaged 5 percent
 annually in real terms over the past several years. Economic,
 development in agriculture, construction, tourism, _-
 transportation, and communications has been aidedby a return
 of Grenadian capital and substantial economic assistance
 following restoration of democratic government in 1983.
 Grenadians enjoy a wide range of civil and political rights.
 Human rights problems in 1991 included incidents of domestic
 violence against women, and some allegations of mistreatment
 and poor living conditions at the prison. On August 14 Prime
 Minister Braithwaite granted clemency to all 14 defendants who
 had been sentenced to death by the courts for the murders of
 Prime Minister Maurice Bishop and several Cabinet members in,
 1983. The sentences were commuted to life-imprisonment.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 There were no reports of politically motivated or other
 extrajudicial killings.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances
 or abductions.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 The Constitution specifically prohibits torture, and there were
 no reported incidents of torture in Grenada in 1991.
 Prisoners in the Richmond Hill Prison have complained of lack
 of exercise opportunities and poor diet, and an American
 
 
 608
 GRENADA
 citizen held overnight in the downtown lockup complained in
 general terms of poor conditions there. The only complaint
 alleging actual mistreatment was made publicly by a former
 Grenadian prisoner following release, but contained few
 specifics.   There is a citizen prison visitation committee,
 established in 1990, which visits the prison periodically to
 check on the condition of the prisoners. They did not report
 having found unacceptable conditions at the prison during the
 year.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 According to law,'police have the right to detain persons on
 suspicion without a warrant, but formal charges must be brought
 within 48 hours. This time limit is adhered to in practice.
 If the detainee is not charged within this time, he must be
 released. In 1991 no one was detained for political reasons.
 The law provides for a judicial determination of the legality
 of detention within 15 days after arrest on a criminal charge.
 Formal arraignment or release of the arrestee must be decided
 within 6a days. These procedures were generally followed.
 There is a functioning system of bail, although those charged
 with capital offenses are not eligible. Persons charged with
 treason may be accorded bail only upon recommendation of the
 Governor General.
 No Grenadian citizen was exiled in 1990.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The right to a fair public trial is provided for by law and is
 observed in practice. Those arrested and charged are brought
 before an independent judiciary and are allowed access to a
 lawyer of their choice. For capital crimes, the courts will
 appoint a lawyer for the accused if he cannot afford one of his
 own choosing, or it will appoint the lawyer who represented the
 accused at the preliminary stages of the prosecution if the
 accused can no longer afford thelawyer's services. In other
 cases which reach the appellate stage, the court will similarly
 appoint a lawyer to represent the accused if he was not
 previously represented, or reappoint the defendant's earlier
 counsel if the appellant can no longer afford the lawyer's
 services. Following a determination by a judicial hearing that
 there is sufficient evidence to substantiate a criminal charge,
 the defendant is remanded for trial. Due to the backlog of
 cases caused by a shortage of judges and facilities, a
 significant amount of time can pass before those charged are
 brought to trial.
 In the cases of the 17 former PRG and army officials convicted
 of the murders of Maurice Bishop and others in October 1983,
 the Government took particular care to afford a fair public
 trial. This included appellate hearings lasting from May 1988
 until September 1990, with the decision handed down on July 12,
 1991. Neither defense attorneys nor the three-person panel of
 Caribbean jurists who were on the Grenada Supreme Court which
 heard the appeals, were from Grenada. The Grenada Supreme
 Court upheld all ifle sentences. A second appeal was made on
 August 9, 1991, but it was dismissed. The Government chose to
 exercise the prerogative of mercy, which is written into the
 Constitution, and commuted all the death sentences to life
 imprisonment.

 GRENADA
 Grenada rejoined the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States'
 (OECS) judicial system in August. By so doing, the Grenada
 Supreme Court, which had been instituted by the PRG in 1979 as
 the highest judicial authority to have jurisdiction over
 Grenadians, ceased to exist for that function. The court is
 now the Supreme Court of Grenada and the West Indies Associated
 States. Under the OECS system, appeals may be taken up to the
 Privy Council in London.
 There are no political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 There were no reports of these types of arbitrary
 interference. Judicially issued warrants for searching homes
 are normally required by law except in cases of hot pursuit.
 In practice, warrants are obtained in the majority of cases
 before a search is conducted.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech.and Press
 Freedom of speech and press is provided for by the Constitution
 and is freely exercised. There are five weekly newspapers and
 several newspapers'that are published irregularly. Most are
 affiliated with political parties, but the three most widely
 circulated newspapers are independent and are frequently
 critical of the Government. Flyers are occasionally
 distributed by the Maurice Bishop Patriotic Movement (named
 after the former leader of the New Jewel Movement whose violent
 overthrow .in October 1983 by. another faction led to the
 intervention by the United States and several Caribbean
 states).
 Grenada has three radio stations. The government station,
 broadcasting on AM, is the most powerful.and covers the whole
 three-island state and parts of the Eastern Caribbean. The
 other two stations are FM by choice and cover only a portion of
 Grenada.   Grenada's television broadcasting system is
 ,government controlled. Political parties were allowed to
 purchase television time for political campaigning.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Grenadians enjoy the right to assemble for any peaceful
 purpose. Supporters of political parties meet frequently and
 hold public rallies; permits are not required for, public
 meetings, but are required for the use of a public address
 system.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 All groups enjoy freedom of religion. The Roman Catholic,
 Seventh Day Adventist, and Anglican faiths predominate. In
 addition there are Presbyterian, Methodist, and other Christian
 groups. There is a small Muslim community but no mosque;
 prayers are held on the premises of a local business. There is
 also a small Baha'i group.

 GRENADA
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 There is freedom of movement within Grenada, and all citizens
 have the right to enter and leave the country except in special
 circumstances as outlined and limited by the 1986 Act to
 Restrict the Freedom of Movement of Certain Persons. This law
 allows the Minister for National Security to restrict travel
 out of Grenada of any person whose aims, tendencies, or
 objectives include the overthrow of the democratic and
 parliamentary system of government; it was not invoked in
 1991. Anyone so restricted may appeal after 3 months to an
 independent and impartial tribunal, presided over by an
 accr-ldited lawyer chosen by the Chief Justice.
 No one was forcibly repatriated from Grenada in 1991. There
 were no official applications to Grenadian authorities for
 refugee status, although the Baha'i community includes Iranians
 who left their homeland to escape persecution. Work permits
 are granted to them, and they are allowed to practice their
 religion freely. The Government has allowed students and
 others to return to Grenada from Cuba and other (former)
 Communist countries. Grenadians are allowed to travel to Cuba
 and receive Cuban scholarships.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 The Constitution provides for the right of citizens to change
 their government through free and fair elections to be held at
 least every 5 years. The political system is not dominated by
 any particular ethnic group, nor are there any restrictions
 that limit participation of any elements of the Grenadian
 population.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Amnesty International and the Institute for the Promotion of
 Human Rights have access to Grenada. The Government cooperates
 with visits from international human rights organizations and
 is responsive to inquiries from local human rights groups.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 There is no evidence of official.discrimination in health care,
 employment, or education. There continue to be some reported
 incidents of unofficial job discrimination against Guyanese and
 other foreign-born residents. Women frequently earn less than
 men performing the same work; such wage differences are less
 marked for the more highly paid jobs.
 Knowledgeable women's rights activists report that violence
 against women in Grenada is common and that most cases of
 spouse abuse go unreported to police authorities. To address
 this problem, one women's group instituted in December 1989 a
 crisis telephone hot line so that victims of rape or spouse
 abuse have a mechanism for requesting support and assistance.
 
 
 611
 GRENADA
 The police confirm that most cases of alleged abuse are not
 reported and others are settled out of court. Grenadian law
 stipulates a sentence of LS years' imprisonment for a
 conviction of rape. Sentences for assault against a spouse
 vary according to the severity of the incident. The Government
 has under consideration Caribbean Community-produced draft
 legislation dealing with violence against women.-
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Workers are free to organize independent labor unions. Labor
 Ministry officials estimate the percentage of the work force
 that is unionized to be between 20 and 25 percent. Membership
 in unions that represent restaurant and hotel workers expanded
 in 1991. With the largest per capita public sector work force
 in the region, the public sector unions hope to limit numbers
 laid off and at the same time obtain a wage increase
 retroactiveto 1990. Union leaders play a significant role in
 the political process, and one labor leader serves in the
 Senate at the nomination'of the government party.
 Workers in the public and private sectors may and do strike
 legally if they give advance notification. There were several
 strikes in 1991, often in statutory entities such as the
 telecommunications company, but all were short lived and
 settled with the intervention of the Ministry of Labor. In
 1991 all unions were free of government control, and none was
 given government financial support. All the major unions in
 Grenada belong to the one umbrella labor federation, the
 Grenada Trades Union Council (GTUC), which holds annual
 conventions and dictates some policy to leaders of the member
 unions. The GTUC and its unions freely affiliate with regional
 and international trade union groups.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 Workers are free to engage in organizing and to participate in
 collective bargaining. Legislation compels employers to
 recognize a union that represents the majority of workers in a
 particular business. The law prohibits antiunion
 discrimination by employers against union members and
 organizers. If a complaint of discrimination arises,
 mechanisms exist for attempting to resolve it. After all
 avenues for resolving a complaint have been exhausted between
 union representatives and employers, both sides may agree to
 ask for the assistance of the Labor Commissioner. If the Labor
 Commissioner is unable to find a resolution to the impasse, the
 Minister of Labor may appoint an arbitration tribunal if both
 parties agree to abide by its ruling. These procedures are
 routinely ancteffectively used.
 Unions may organize and bargain anywhere in the country.
 including in the one export processing zone (EPZ), which is not
 exempted from Grenada's labor legislation. However, no EPZ
 firm is presently unionized; the one firm previously unionized
 has since shut down its Grenada-based operations.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 The Constitution specifically prohibits forced labor, and no
 such instances were reported in 1991.

 GRENADA
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 The statutory minimum age for employment of children, 16 years,
 is enforced in the formal.sector'by periodic checks made by
 inspectors from the Ministry of Labor. Enforcement efforts in
 the informal sector are lax.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 Legislated minimum daily wage rates, most recently revised in
 1990, are set for the agricultural, industrial, and commercial
 sectors. Most workers in Grenada receive other benefits from
 their employers through collective bargaining, but even when
 these benefits are added to wages from a full-time minimum wage
 job, it is barely enough to provide a decent standard of living.
 The law does not prescribe a set number of hours as the
 standard workweek, except for the public sector which is
 expected to work a 40-hour week Monday through Friday.
 However, the normal workweek in all sectors seldom exceeds 40
 hours, although in the commercial sector this includes Saturday
 morning work.
 Health and safety standards set by the Government are minimal
 and not effectively enforced. Laws on working conditions and
 their enforcement apply equally to the export processing zone.
