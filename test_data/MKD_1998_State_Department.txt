 THE FORMER YUGOSLAV REPUBLIC OF MACEDONIA
 The Former Yugoslav Republic-of Macedonia, which became independent following
 the breakup of Yugoslavia, is a parliamentary democracy led by a coalition govern-
 
 
 1375
 ment. It has a popularly elected president. In the third multiparty parliamentary
 elections held in October and November, oppositionparties defeated parties of the
 governing coalition. International observers concluded that elections were conducted
 fairly and reflected the will of the electorate. The judiciary is generally independent.
 The Ministry of Interior oversees the uniformed police, criminal police, border po-
 lice, and the state intelligence service. Municipal police chiefs are responsible to the
 Ministry of the Interior, not to municipal leaders. The Ministry is under the control
 of a civilian minister; a parliamentary commission oversees operations. The Min-
 istry of Defense shares with the border police responsibility for border security.
 Some members of the police occasionally committed human rights abuses.
 The economy is in transition from Yugoslav-style communism to a market-based
 system. Most firms are privatized, big money-losing enterprises are being restruc-
 tured, and inflation has been reduced to less than 4 percent. The economic picture
 has iproved substantially since the lifting of the Greek embargo and the suspen-
 sion of United Nations sanctions against Serbia, both in 1995, before which the
 gross domestic product fell an estimated 50 percent. Growth resumed slowly in 1996
 and continued at about a 5 percent rate in 1998. Unemployment is high; the gray
 economy is large. Some workers receive their pay several months late.
 The Government generally respected the human rights of its citizens; however,
 there were problems in some areas. Police abused suspects and prisoners. The Gov-
 ernment's practice of police compelling citizens to appear for questioning continued,
 despite official claims that the practice had ended pursuant to a 1997 law. Another
 1997 law imposed some limitations on religious practices. Societal discrimination
 against minorities, including ethnic Albanians, ethnic Turks, Roma, and ethnic
 Serbs is a problem. Ethnic minorities made progress in securing more representa-
 tion in state institutions, although ethnic Macedonians continue to hold a dispropor-
 tionate number of positions. Violence and discrimination against women remain
 problems; the trafficing of women and girls for prostitution is also a problem.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHT
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political or
 other extrajudicial killings.
 The parliamentary commission investigatingpolice conduct during the July 1997
 demonstration, in which three persons were killed completed its report in March.
 The commission concluded that police action in Gostivar to remove Albanian and
 Turkish flags from the municipal building was justified legally. In the riots that fol-
 lowed the police action, the commission determined that certain individuals and
 groups had exceeded their authority. The commission added that certain police offi-
 cers searched homes illegally. However, the commission did not identify those per-
 sons responsible for abuses. Instead, it called on the Ministry of Interior to take re-
 sponsibility for identifying those responsible and to take legal action agalnst them.
 The Parliament, on adopting the commission's report, required the Government to
 respond by June, but there was no official response from the Government. However,
 the Government began to take some steps related to the report's recommendations,
 such as the improvement of police training. Other actions, including the reform of
 the Ministry of Interior to include an increase in ethnic minority representation in
 the police also are under way but have not been formally announced. However, the
 Government did not act on the commission's key recommendation to identify those
 persons responsible for individual abuses.
 The investigation into the 1995 car bomb attack on President Gllgorov continued
 but produced no results.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution prohibits such treatment and punishment; however, oice used
 excessive force during the ap prehension of criminal suspects, and they atusedpris-
 oners, especially members of ethic minorities. In September and October, following
 the arrests of six individuals suspected of arms smuggling, family members reported
 cruel treatment of the arrested individuals. Several off-duty police officers were fired
 from the force in September for assaulting a group of young men, who then pressed
 charges.
 Albanian separatists set off three homm ad o mbs in Tetovo in January, without
 causing casuaties or much damage. Three more bombs exploded in Skopie in July,
 without injury or damage.
 Prison conditions meet minimum international standards.
 The Government permits visits by human rights monitors and the Human Rights
 Ombudsman. The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) plans to begin
 
 
 1376
 prison visits as soon as the Government agrees to ICRC's standard modalities for
 such visits.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution states that a person
 must be arraigned in court within 24 hours of arrest. The maximum length of pre-
 trial detention was increased- in 1998 from 90 to 180 days by constitutional amend-
 ment. The accused is entitled to contact a lawyer at the time of arrest and to have
 a lawyer present during police and court proceedings. According to human rights ob-
 servers and criminal defense attorneys, police sometimes violate the 24-hour re-
 quirement and deny immediate access to an attorney. Although the law requires
 warrants for arrests, this provision-is sometimes ignored, and the warrant issued
 only some time after the arrest.
 The Government continued the practice of police compelling citizens to appear at
 police stations through an "invitation" for "informative talks." Although a law on
 criminal procedures was passed in 1997 stating that police cannot force citizens to
 appear for these sessions without presentation of a court order, the practice contin-
 ued, particularly with citizens of ethnic minority origin, despite government claims
 that the practice had ended. For example, police "invited" five ethnic Albanian polit-
 ical activists to report -to a Skopje police station following one of a series of small
 bomb detonations in Skopje. The police had no official warrant nor did they docu-
 ment the meetings. The Government did not respond during the year to concerns
 raised by human rights groups and others about the continued practice.
 The Government does not practice forced exile.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution provides for an independent judi-
 ciary, and the Government respects this provision in practice, although the court
 system is still developing and is sometimes inefficient and slow. The outcomes of
 a small number of cases were suspected of being influenced from outside the judici-
 ary.
 The court system is three tiered, comprising municipal courts, district courts, and
 a Supreme Court. A Constitutional Court deals with matters of constitutional inter-
 pretation.
 The Constitutional Court has a mandate to protect the human rights of citizens
 but has not taken action in any case in this area. In addition, the Constitution pro-
 vides for a public attorney to protect the constitutional and legal rights of citizens
 when violated by bodies of state administration and other agencies with public man-
 dates. The Office of the People's Ombudsman fills that role. The Ombudsman was
 appointed in July 1997, and the office became fully functional during the year (see
 Section 4).
 Trials are presided over by judges appointed by the Republican Judicial Council
 (an independent agency) and confirmed by Parliament. The judges are assisted by
 two members of the community who serve essentially as consulting jurors, although
 the judge has the final word. Court hearings and the rendering of verdicts are open
 to the public except in some cases, such as those involving minors and those in
 which the personal safety of the defendant is concerned. Trials cannot be televised,
 pursuant to the Criminal Procedure Code, although the court can in certain cases
 authorize the presence of television and film cameras.
 Four persons jailed during the year for crimes relating to the July 1997 events
 in Gostivar and Tetovo consider themselves political prisoners. The mayor and the
 municipal council president of Tetovo were sentenced to 22 years in prison for fail-
 ure to observe a Constitutional Court order to remove Albanian flags from munici-
 pal buildings. The mayor of Gostivar was sentenced to 13 years and 8 months in
 prison for inciting riots and interethnc hatred, failing to abide by a judicial deci-
 sion, and organizing resistance to the Government. The sentence was reduced on ap-
 peal to 7 years. The municipal council president of Gostivar was sentenced to 2
 years' imprisonment in the incident. The four men reported to jail peacefully and
 are serving their sentences. The Ombudsman visited them and reported that they
 had no complaints. Nonetheless, ethnic Albanian political parties sponsored several
 mass rales early this year to protest the sentences and to urge the release of the
 men, whom they consider political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution prohibits such practices, government authorities generally respect
 these prohibitions, and violations are subject to effective legal sanction.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-,The Constitution provides for freedom of speech
 and of the press, and the Government generally respects these rights in practice.
 Several daily newspapers are published in Skopje, as well as numerous weekly
 or periodical political and other publications. Most towns and municipalities have
 local newspapers. Government-subsidized newspapers in the Albanian and Turkish
 
 
 1377
 languages are published and distributed nationally by the leading news publishing
 house. The Government subsidizes some other newspapers and magazines. The
 process of granting media subsidies was not transparent this year, leading to
 charges of political bias in government support for the independent media. Several
 privately owned publications have a wide distribution throughout the country, and
 some are considered to be oriented towards opposition political parties. The media
 that remain partially state owned are government oriented but report opposition
 press conferences and statements and in general provide coverage of the major oppo-
 sition parties.
 The leading newspaper publisher is still partially government owned and controls
 one of only two modern, high-speed printing facilities in the country, as well as most
 newspaper kiosks. Opposition parties allege that government control and manipula-
 tion of the media prevent them from getting their messages across. However, the
 media were scrutinized closely during the year for their coverage of the parliamen-
 tary election campaign and voting. International monitors noted that the media pro-
 vided generally unbiased coverage of the full spectrum of parties and candidates.
 However, several media outlets were criticized for their clear bias in favor of one
 political party.
 Distributors of foreign newspapers and magazines must obtain permission of the
 Ministry of Interior. All such requests were approved during the year. Foreign news-
 papers, including those from neighboring countries, are available throughout the
 country.
 One journalist, the editor of a large circulation opposition-oriented weekly maga-
 zine, was the victim of assault in 1998. The attack was alleged to be politically moti-
 vated, and the case was not solved.
 The new Broadcast Council set up under 1997 legislation implemented a licensing
 regime to award concessions to radio and television broadcasters. International ex-
 perts reviewed the process and standards and found them to meet international
 norms. Concerns that the Broadcast Council's recommendations would be subject to
 political pressure proved unfounded. Following a fairly transparent process involv-
 ing several rounds of frequency distribution, the Ministry of Transportation and
 Communication awarded licenses to virtually all broadcasters who applied, includ-
 ing for local and national frequencies. There are dozens of small independent radio
 and television broadcasters throughout the country. The broadcast law directs that
 broadcast fees collected through individual electric bills subsidize both state-run
 Macedonian Radio and Television and the maintenance of infrastructure for other
 public and commercial broadcasting. Some stations are concerned that license fees
 are too high (although within international standards), but collection of the fees has
 not been completed and some adjustments were expected with the formation of the
 new Parliament and Government.
 Individuals and opposition political groups may criticize the Government publicly
 without reprisal. The media do not appear to practice self-censorship due to fear of
 government reprisal. The Government does not censor books and other publications,
 nor does it censor films.
 The Government respects academic freedom. Because higher education is not
 available in the Albanian language except for teacher training, some ethnic Alba-
 nians claim that they do not have complete academic freedom. They want to see the
 unauthorized Tetovo university gain legal status so that they can study in their
 mother tongue (see Section 5).
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 freedom of assembly, and the Government generally respects this right in practice.
 Advance notification of large meetings is optional; political and protest rallies occur
 regularly without major incident. Religious gatherings, if they occur outside of spe-
 cific religious facilities, must be approved in advance by the Ministry of Interior and
 can only be convened by registered religious groups.
 Three organizers of a rally demanding international attention to the situation of
 ethnic Albanians in Kosovo were arrested. Authorities charged them with inciting
 racial and ethnic hatred. They were convicted and sentenced to a unknown punish-
 ment. They apparently were held responsible for the fact that, during the rally, sev-
 eral demonstrators chanted provocative slogans and waved the Albanian national
 flag. Their cases are on appeal.
 The Constitution provides for freedom of association, and the Government gen-
 erally respects this right in practice. Political parties and organizations are required
 to register with a court. More than 40 political parties are registered, including eth-
 nically based parties of Albanians, Turks, Serbs, and Roma. A new ethnic Albanian
 party, comprising two previously registered parties, was denied registration by the
 judge responsible for the case, based on the grounds that the party's symbols and
 program contained elements that the judge considered unconstitutional. Subsequent
 
 
 1378
 
 rulings of the Appeals Court and the Constitutional Court questioned the grounds
 for the registration court's. decision and returned the case to the original judge.
 However, even after the party modified its program to reflect some of the judge's
 concerns, the court ultimately blocked the registration because of the party's use of
 symbols of a foreign state (Albania), which is specifically prohibited under the Con-
 stitution.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution specifically provides for freedom of reli-
 gion for the Macedonian Orthodox Church and other religious communities and
 groups, and the Government generally does not interfere with the practice of reli-
 gion. However, a 1997 law limits some aspects of religious practice. While only the
 Macedonian Orthodox Church is mentioned by name in the Constitution, it does not
 enjoy official status.
 The 1997 Law on Religious Communities and Groups designates the Macedonian
 Orthodox Church, the Islamic community, and the Roman Catholic Church as 'reli-
 gious communities," while all other religions are designated "religious groups." How-
 ever, despite the difference in designation, both religious communities and religious
 groups are considered "legal entities." The law places some limitations on religious
 practices. For example, only citizens with permanent residence in the country may
 found a religious group. The law also stipulates that religious instruction only can
 be carried out in public spaces where religious services are held and that foreigners
 who wish to conduct religious services must obtain a routinely granted permit from
 the Government's Commission on Interreligious Relations before they enter the
 country. Some religious leaders have voiced concerns about the new law, although
 its practical effect has not been demonstrated fully. The law also requires that any-
 one carrying out religious work and religious rites be registered with the Commis-
 sion. There are 18 registered religious groups and communities. An Islamic group
 was denied registration during the year. The Commission stated that the denial was
 due to the group's failure to meet administrative requirements; the Commission con-
 siders the case open.
 Several registered Protestant groups were unable to obtain building permits for
 new church facilities due to normal bureaucratic complications that affect all new
 construction.
 The refusal of the Serbian Orthodox Church to recognize the independence of the
 Macedonian Orthodox Church has led to difficulties for ethnic Serbs who wish to
 worship in their own church. On a number of occasions the Government refused
 Serbian Orthodox priests permission to enter the country and apparently plans to
 continue doing so until the Serbian Church recognizes the Macedonian Church.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-Citizens are permitted free movement within the country as well as the
 right to leave and return. These rights may be restricted for security, public health,
 and safety reasons but are fully respected in practice.
 Some provisions of the law on citizenship are highly restrictive, requiring, for ex-
 ample, 15 years of residence for most naturalizations. This has left several thousand
 persons who were living legally in the country at the time of independence without
 citizenship. The law particularly affects ethnic Albanians who had moved to the
 country from other parts of Yugoslavia before Macedonia's independence. As citizens
 of the predecessor state living legally in the territory of the country at the time of
 independence, they believe they have a right to citizenship. The law also affects
 many Roma who wish to become citizens, particularly with regard to difficulties
 they encounter in establishing residence and meeting requirements of a regular in-
 come. In accordance with the Council of Europe Convention on Citizenship, which
 the Government signed, it must shorten the period of residency necessary for natu-
 ralization to 10 years.
 Ethnic Albanians constitute a disproportionately high number of emigrants, due
 to stronger familial ties outside the country and longstanding economic relationships
 in other countries.
 The Government has not formulated a policy regarding refugees, asylees, or first
 asylum. However, it is working with the United Nations High Commissioner for Ref-
 ugees to develop appropriate laws in this area.
 A few dozen ethnic Albanians from Kosovo have sought first asylum. There were
 no reports of the forced return of persons to a country where they feared persecu-
 tion.
 The Government remains concerned about the flow of economic and other illegal
 migrants from neighboring Albania, as well as from the province of Kosovo in Ser-
 bia-Montenegro. As the military's border protection capacity improved, illegal migra-
 tion and smuggling incidents declined. Nonetheless, illegal entries continue and oc-
 casionally have led to shooting incidents.
 
 
 1379
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The Constitution provides citizens with the right to change their government
 peacefully, and citizens exercise this right in practice through periodic, free, and fair
 elections held on the basis of universal suffrage. The countrs third parliamentary
 elections were held in October and November and resulted in an opposition victory
 and a change of government.
 The unicameral Parliament governs the country. The Prime Minister, as head of
 government, is selected by the party or coalition that can produce a majority in the
 arliament He and the other ministers may not be Members of Parliament. The
 Prime Minister is formally appointed by the President, who is head of state, Chair-
 man of the Security Council, and commander in chief of the armed forces.
 Although no formal restrictions exist on the participation of women in politics and
 government, they are severely underrepresented in these areas. The Government
 as to female ministers and two female vice presidents with the rank of minister.
 In the newly elected Parliament 9 of 120 members are women, an increase from
 only 4 women in the previous Parliament. During the election campaign, the impor-
 tance of increasing women's representation in Parliament was highlighted in the
 media and by nongovenena organizations.
 A number of political parties represent the interests of minorities, including eth-
 nic Albanians, ethnic Turks, ethnic Serbs, and Roma. Minorities nevertheless com-
 plained that the political structures were biased against them. A new electoral law
 incorporated elements of proportional representation, partly to address these con-
 cerns. A total of 35 of the 120 parliamentary members were chosen on the basis of
 proportionality, while the other 85 members were elected in single-member districts.
 Some ethnic Albanians complained that the Albanian-majority districts had more
 voters than districts with predominantly ethnic Macedonian populations, thus vio-
 lating the "one-person, one-vote" principle. There is some merit to this complaint,
 but the ethnic Albanian party was consulted on the 1996 redistricting. Also, all the
 political parties supported the new electoral law. Some ethnic Albanians and Roma
 also complain that discrimination against them in citizenship decisions effectively
 disenfranchises a large portion of their community (see Section 2.d.).
 Ethnic minority members of the new Parliament will include 25 ethnic Albanians,
 1 Macedonian Muslim, 1 Rom, and an indeterminate, small number of Vlachs.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The Government generally is responsive to the concerns of human rights groups.
 However, it did not respond to concerns raised by human rights groups and others
 about the practice of police compelling citizens to appear at police stations for so-
 called "informative a    see  ection 1.d.). Human rights groups and ethnic com-
 munity representatives meet freely with foreign representatives without government
 interference. Several independent forums for human rights exist and operate freely,
 but their activities have not been prominent. In November one such forum, with the
 support of the Human Rights Ombudsman, widely distributed an information card
 for citizens on basic human rights.
 In 1997 Parliament passed a law establishing an Ombudsman, intended to ensure
 the protection of citizens' constitutional and legal rights. The Ombudsman's office
 became fully functional in 1998. However, most complaints filed to date are not
 human rights issues and are instead about city licensing and municipal code prob-
 lems.
 The Government allows independent missions by foreign observers and during the
 year hosted a delegation from the Council of Europe's Committee for the Prevention
 of Torture. In late 1997 the country was removed from the mandate of the Special
 Rapporteur for the former Yugoslavia of the United Nations Human Rights Commis-
 sion.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution provides for equal rights for all citizens regardless of their sex,
 race, color of skin, national or social origin, political or religious beliefs, property,
 or social status. However, societal discrimination against ethnic minorities and the
 protection of women's rights are problems.
 Women.-Violence against women, especially in the family setting, is common.
 Criminal procedures are available for victims of rape, including limited legal re-
 course in the case of marital rape. Cultural norms discourage the reporting of such
 violence, and criminal charges on grounds of domestic violence are very rare. Public
 concern about violence against women is not evident in the media, although some
 
 
 1380
 
 women's groups are working to raise awareness of the issue. Shelters for victims
 of spousal abuse are operated by nongovernmental organizations. A hot line remains
 open, but its hours are limited.
 The trafficking of women and girls for prostitution and pornography is a problem.
 In several cases during the year, women from Bulgaria, Russia, and Ukraine were
 discovered in several large towns. They are believed to have been'recruited by traf-
 fickers in women for the purposes of sexual exploitation.
 The sexual harassment of women in the workplace is a problem. Maternity bene-
 fits are good, with 9-months paid maternity leave. Women also retain for 2 years
 the right to return to their jobs.
 The Constitution provides that women possess the same legal rights as men. Mac-
 edonian society, in both the Muslim and Christian communities, is patriarchal, and
 the advancement of women into nontraditional roles is limited. Women are severely
 underrepresented in the higher levels of the private sector, although some profes-
 sional women are prominent. Women from some parts of the ethnic Albanian com-
 munity do not have equal opportunities for employment and education, primarily
 due to traditional and religious constraints on their full participation in society. In
 Muslim communities, especially among 'nore traditional ethnic Albanians, some
 women are not enfranchised fully, due to the practice of family/proxy voting,
 through which men vote on behalf of the women in their families.
 Women's advocacy groups include the Humanitarian Association for the Emanci-
 p ation, Solidarity, and Equality of Women, the Union of Associations of Macedonian
 omen, and the League of Albanian Women.
 Children.-The Government is committed to the rights and welfare of children but
 in some areas is limited by resource constraints. Education is compulsory through
 the eighth grade, or to the ages of 15 or 16. At boththe primary and secondary lev-
 els, girls in some ethnic Albanian communities are underrepresented in schools. The
 Government encouraged ethnic minority students, particularly girls, to enroll in sec-
 ondary schools. Medical care for children is adequate but hampered by the general
 difficult economic circumstances of the country and the weak medical system.
 There is no societal pattern of abuse against children.
 People With Disabilities.--Social programs to meet the needs of the disabled exist
 to the extent that government resources allow. Discrimination on the basis of dis-
 ability is forbidden by law. No laws or regulations mandate accessibility for disabled
 persons.
 National/RaciallEthnic Minorities.-The population of 2.2 million is composed of
 a variety of national and ethnic groups, mainly Macedonians, Albanians, Turks,
 Roma, Serbs, and Vlachs. All citizens are equal under the law. The Constitution pro-
 vides for the protection of the ethnic, cultural, linguistic, and religious identity of
 minorities, including state support for education in minority languages through sec-
 ondary school and the official use of ethnic minority languages in areas where eth-
 nic minorities make up a majority of the population.
 Ethnic tensions and prejudices are present in society. -The Government is commit-
 ted to a policy of peaceful integration of all ethnic groups into society but faces polit-
 ical resistance and continued popular prejudices.
 Representatives of the ethnic Albanian community, by far the Jargest minority
 group with 23 percent of the population according to government statistics, are the
 most vocal in charging discrimination. The underrepresentation of Albanians in the
 military and police is a major grievance of the community. In areas where the eth-
 nic Albanian population is large, the police force remains overwhelmingly Slavic
 Macedonian. Members of ethnic minorities constitute 8 percent of the Ministry of
 the Interior; their numbers among police officers are lower. To raise this figure, in
 1994-95 the Ministry introduced a quota of 22 percent for ethnic minorities when
 enrolling pupils at the police secondary school, although attrition has meant that
 graduating classes are not represented proportionately
 The military has achieved some success in its efforts to recruit and retain minor-
 ity officers and cadets. Military service is a universal male obligation, and most
 young men, whatever their ethnic origin, answer their conscription notices. The pro-
 portion of ethnic Albanians in the ranks is now estimated at 25 percent. There are
 fewer ethnic Albanians in the officer corps, but some progress is being made in this
 area as well. Of junior officers, 8 percent are from ethnic minorities, while 14 per-
 cent of new cadets at the military academy are from ethnic minorities. Just over
 8 percent of the civilian employees are from ethnic minorities; ethnic Albanians con-
 stitute only 3 percent of Ministry of Defense civilians. The deputy minister of de-
 fense and one of eight general officers are ethnic Albanians.
 The Constitution provides for primary and secondary education in the languages
 of the ethnic minorities. Primary education is available in Macedonian, Albanian,
 Turkish, and Serbian. Albanian-language education is a crucial issue for the ethnic
 
 
 1381
 
 Albanian community; it is seen as vital for preserving Albanian heritage and cul-
 ture. Almost all ethnic Albanian children receive 8 years of education in Albanian-
 language schools. The number of ethnic minority students who receive secondary
 education in their mother tongues is increasing, and was 14 percent during the
 year, up from 13 percent in the previous school year. Still, most students from eth-
 nic minorities do not go on to high school, partly because of the lack of available
 classes in minority languages at the secondary level and partly because the tradi-
 tional nature of parts of Albanian society leads many families in rural areas to see
 no need to educate their children, especially girls, beyond the eighth grade.
 At the university level, ethnic minorities are underrepresented, but there has
 been much progress in increasing the number of ethnic minority applicants and stu-
 dents since 1991. There are eased admission requirements for minorities at the uni-
 versities in Skopje and Bitola for up to 23 percent of entering places, a quota that
 was not filled in 1998. Ethnic minorities in the 1998-99 school year constituted 16
 percent of the enrolled students. Most university education is in Macedonian, al-
 hough there is Albanian-language university education for students at Skopje Uni-
 versity's teacher training faculty who study to teach in Albanian-language primary
 and secondary schools. An obstacle to increasing university attendance of ethnic Al-
 banians and Roma is their low but increasing enrollment in secondary education,
 especially of gils
 Demands for the legalization of an unofficial Albanian-language university in
 Tetovo during 1995 led to a violent clash between demonstrators and police in which
 one ethnic Albanian died and about 30 people were injured. Since then the Govern-
 ment has tacitly allowed the university-which it still considers to be illegal-to
 function without giving it any official recognition. The issue of Albanian-language
 university education was debated productively during the parliamentary election
 campaign.
 The Government has not supported three other demands of some ethnic Albanian
 leaders that would require parliamentary approval: Use of the Albanian language
 in dealings with the central government and Parliament, relaxing citizenship laws
 that now require 15 years of legal residence (see Section 2.d.), and official use of
 the Albanian flag.
 Ethnic Turks, who make up about 4 percent of the population, also complain of
 governmental, societal, and cultural discrimination. Their main complaints center
 on Turkish-language education and media. One continuing dispute has been over
 the desire of parents who consider themselves Turkish to educate their children in
 Turkish despite the fact that they do not speak Turkish at home. The Education
 Ministry refuses to provide Turkish-language education for them, noting that the
 Constitution provides for education in the mother tongues, not a foreign language.
 The parents have banded together to hire teachers of their own, but this kind of
 private education is not legally authorized.
 Ethnic Serbs, who comprise about 2 percent of the population, also complained
 about discrimination, alleged censorship of the Serbian press, and their inability to
 worship freely in the Serbian Orthodox Church.
 Little tension is evident between the Roma and other citizens of the country, al-
 though Roma tend to occupy the lowest economic rung of society. In 1996 optional
 education in the Romani language started at four elementary schools, although
 there has been no call for a full curriculum. Although there were two Romani mem-
 bers of the previous Parliament, only one was elected in the October-November elec-
 tions. There is some Romani-language broadcasting.
 There are also a number of Macedonian Muslims and Bosnian Muslims in the
 country. Some Macedonian Muslims contend that they are identified too closely with
 ethnic Albanians, most of whom are also Muslim, with whose policies the Macedo-
 nian Muslims disagree.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution provides for the right to form trade
 unions, but this right is restricted for military members, police, and civil servants.
 Independent trade unions have been allowed to organize since 1992, when an As-
 sociation of Independent and Autonomous Unions was formed. However, there is
 still a national trade union. The Confederation of Trade Unions of Macedonia is the
 successor organization to the old Communist labor confederation. It maintains the
 assets of the old unions and is the Government's main negotiating partner, along
 with the Chamber of Economy, on labor issues. While its officers may tend to oppose
 strikes because of the legacy of the past, they appear to be genuinely independent
 of the Government and committed to the interests of the workers they represent.
 The number of strikes declined in 1998. The reasons for the strikes varied from
 demands for increases in the state budget (judicial employees) to strikes opposing
 
 
 1382
 
 privatization proceedings (Bitola brewery workers). Strikes were generally small
 and confined to factory grounds, but striking bus factory workers marched in front
 of the government building. Strikes were calm and well organized and passed with-
 out serious incident.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The Constitution implicitly
 recognizes employees' right to bargain collectively, a concept nevertheless still in its
 infancy. Legislation in this area has yet to be passed by Parliament.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Legal prohibitions against forced
 labor, including that performed by children, are observed in practice.
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment.-The con-
 stitutional minimum age for employment of children is 15 years. The law prohibits
 forced or bonded labor by children, and the Government enforces this prohibition
 effectively (see Section 6.c.). Children may not legally work nights or more than 40-
 hour weeks. Education is compulsory through grade eight, or to the ages of 14 or
 15. The Ministry of Labor and Social Welfare is responsible for enforcing laws regu-
 lating the employment of children.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-:-The average monthly wage in November was
 about $179 (9,283 denars). The minimum wage is by law two-thirds of the average
 wage. By comparison, an average month's worth of food for a family of four cost
 $184 (9,566 denars). This economic situation-meant that few.workeri could support
 a family on their wages alone. Many households are dual-income, and many people
 take on additional work in the gray market.
 Yugoslavia had extensive laws concerning acceptable conditions of work, including
 an official 42-hour workweek with a minimum 24-hour rest period and generous va-
 cation and sick leave benefits. The country adopted-many of these provisions, includ-
 ing the workweek and rest period. There is pressure on the Government to reform
 the welfare system in order to cut government expenditures, but no reforms were
 undertaken during the year. The Constitution provides for safe working conditions,
 temporary disability compensation, and leave'benefits. Although laws and regula-
 tions on worker safety remain from the Yugoslav era, credible reports suggest that
 they are not strictly enforced. The Ministry of Labor and Social Welfare is respion-
 sible for enforcing regulations pertaining to working conditions.
 Under the law, if workers have safety concerns, employers are obliged to address
 dangerous situations. Should employers fail to do so, employees are entitled legally
 to leave the dangerous situation without losing their jobs.
