 THE WESTERN SAHARA
 Morocco assumed administration of the northern three provinces
 of the Western Sahara after the withdrawal of Spanish forces
 in 1975, and of the southernmost province in 1979 when
 Mauritania renounced its claim to the area. Sporadic fighting
 continued in 1987 between the Moroccan armed forces and the
 Polisario, an organization supported by Algeria which seeks
 independence for the Western Sahara..
 Since 1977 the northern provinces of-El Ayoun, Smara, and
 Boujdour have participated in elections held throughout
 Morocco. Communal elections were'held in the southernmost
 province of Oued Ed Dahbab in May 1981. The four Saharan
 provinces participated in 1983 elections and in all votes in
 1984, including the referendum on the Moroccan-Libyan Treaty
 of Union and direct and indirect elections to Parliament,
 Participation in both the referendum and the direct elections
 to Parliament tended to run higher in the Western Sahara than
 in almost all other areas of Morocco.
 All 10 parliamentary seats allotted to the Western Sahara
 provinces are filled by persons of Western Saharan origin.
 The governors of the Saharan provinces, appointed by the King,
 are all native Saharans. In consultation with elected
 municipal and provincial councils, the four governors
 administer their provinces in the same manner as the provinces
 and prefectures of Morocco proper are administered. Most
 village and civil servants are also locally recruited
 Saharans. The governors' primary responsibilities are to
 accelerate development and the delivery of social services.
 Investment in the Western Sahara remains tax-free, and the
 Moroccan Government has stipulated other financial incentives
 to encourage development.
 Sovereignty over the Western Saharan territory remains a
 subject of international dispute. At the June 1981 summit
 meeting of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) in Nairobi,
 Morocco agreed that a referendum should be held to decide the
 question. The OAU summit meeting in 1983 resolved that the
 referendum be held in December 1983 but also called for direct
 negotiations between Morocco and the Polisario, a request
 which Morocco rejected; the referendum also did not take place.
 Morocco walked out of the November 1984 OAU summit in protest
 over the seating of the Saharan Democratic Arab Republic
 delegation. Morocco later called for the United Nations to
 administer the referendum to determine the population's wishes
 on independence or integration with Morocco. In October 1985,
 King Hassan, in a message to the U.N., also announced a
 unilateral cease-fire by Moroccan forces in the region. He
 pledged that Moroccan forces would only defend themselves if
 fired upon.
 In 1986 U.N. Secretary General Perez de Cuellar lent his good
 offices to an effort involving "proximity talks" with Morocco
 and the Polisario, with a view to arranging a referendum under
 U.N. auspices. Although the parties concerned agree in
 principle to a referendum, they have yet to agree on the
 modalities, particularly regarding who would be allowed to
 vote and whether or not the Moroccan military and civilian
 administration would remain in the region at the time of the
 referendum. In addition, Algeria and the Polisario continue
 to call for direct negotiations between Morocco and the
 Polisario prior to a referendum. jn November 20 a U.N.
 technical mission visited the Sahara for a 2-week visit to

 THE  ESTERN SAHARA
 explore the problems involved in organizing a ceasefire and
 arranging'a referendum. The civilian population in the
 portion of the WesternISahara under effective Moroccan control
 is subject tO Moroccan political. institutions and laws.
 Officially it is'subject to the same human rights practices as
 other Moroccans in areas of undisputed Moroccan sovereignty.
 There are, however, reports that Saharans often have
 difficulties obtaining passports, that their political views
 are more closely monitored than those of residents of Morocco
 proper, and that police and paramilitary authorities react
 especially harshly against'those suspected of supporting the
 Polisario. The Moroccan Government counters such reports with
 allegations of Poiisario human rights abuses. There have been
 few opportunities to evaluate the human rights practices of
 the Polisario in areas outside the berm, the Moroccan
 earthwork defense line, and these allegations cannot be
 confirmed'or denied.
