 AFGHANISTAN *
 Afghanistan in 1998 continued to experience civil war and political instability.
 There was no functioning central government. The Pashtun-dominated ultra-con-
 servative Islamic movement known as the Taliban controlled 85 percent of the coun-
 try, including Kabul, the capital and largest city. In 1997 the Taliban changed the
 name of the country to the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan, with Taliban leader,
 Mullah Omar, as head of state and commander of the faithful. There is a six-mem-
 ber ruling council in Kabul but ultimate authority for Taliban rule rested in the
 Taliban's inner Shura (Council), located in the southern city of Kandahar, and in
 Mullah Omar. Territories previously held in the north and center of the country by
 General Abdul Rashid Dostam, an ethnic Uzbek, and by the Hezb-i-Wahdat, led by
 Usted Karim Khalili, of the Shi'a Hazara ethnic minority, fell to Taliban forces dur-
 ing the year. Mazar-i-Sharif, the last major city to remain outside of Taliban control,
 fell to Taliban forces on August 8; the city of Bamiyan fell to the Taliban on Septem-
 ber 13. Former President Burhanuddin Rabbani claimed to be the head of the Gov-
 ernment and controlled most of the country's embassies abroad and retained Af-
 ghanistan's United Nations seat after the U.N. General Assembly deferred a deci-
 sion on Afghanistan's credentials. Rabbani and his military commander, Ahmed
 Shah Masood, both Tajiks, continued to control some largely ethnic Tajik territory
 in the country's northeast. However, Masood's forces remained within rocket range
 of Taliban-held Kabul. As of year's end, the Taliban and Masood's forces continued
 to battle on multiple fronts. Several provincial administrations maintained limited
 functions but civil institutions were mostly nonexistent. There is no constitution,
 rule of law, or independent judiciary.
 The U.N. Special Envoy to Afghanistan, Lakhdar Brahimi, engaged in extensive
 discussions with the Afghan parties and other interested nations. A group of rep-
 resentatives from the six nations bordering Afghanistan plus the United States and
 Russia met in New York in September to look at ways to end the conflict. Iran,
 which was angered by the killing of Iranian diplomats by Taliban forces in Mazar-
 i-Sharif in August and the defeat of its Shi'a allies, massed troops on its Afghan
 border during September and October, but refrained from direct incursions into Af-
 ghan territory.
 The Taliban remained the country's primary military force, and Taliban members
 committed numerous serious human rights abuses. Agriculture, including high lev-
 els of opium poppy cultivation, was the mainstay of the economy. Afghanistan re-
 mained the second largest opium producer in the world. Lack of resources and the
 war have impeded reconstruction of irrigation systems, repair of market roads, and
 replanting of orchards in some areas. The presence of an estimated 5 to 7 million
 land mines has restricted areas for cultivation and slowed the return of refugees
 who are needed to rebuild the economy. The laying of new mine fields by all sides
 exacerbated an already difficult situation. Trade was mainly in fruits, minerals, and
 gems, as well as goods smuggled to Pakistan. There are also rival currencies, both
 very inflated. Formal economic activity remained minimal and was inhibited by re-
 current fighting and roads blocked by local commanders. These blockages were re-
 moved in territory taken by the Taliban. Reconstruction was continuing in Herat,
 Kandahar, and Ghazni, areas that are under firm Taliban control. Severe earth-
 quakes on February 4 and May 30, both centered in the northeast, caused extensive
 damage and loss of life. The northern areas all suffered from brigandage.
 * The U.S. Embassy in Kabul has been closed for security reasons since January, 1989. Infor-
 mation on the human rights situation is therefore limited.
 (1847)
 
 
 1848
 The overall human rights situation is extremely poor. Serious human rights viola-
 tions continued to occur, and citizens were precluded from changing their govern-
 ment or choosing their leaders peacefully. There were credible reports of large-scale
 massacres carried out by the Taliban as they captured Mazar-i-Sharif in August.
 These attacks were reportedly in retaliation for the thousands of Taliban soldiers
 massacred by anti-Taliban forces when the anti-Taliban forces retook the city after
 a brief Taliban occupation in 1997. Armed units, local commanders, and rogue indi-
 viduals were responsible for political killings, abductions, kidnapings for ransom,
 torture, rape, arbitrary detention, and looting. Prison conditions are poor. Summary
 justice was common. In Taliban areas, strict and oppressive order is imposed and
 stiff punishments for crimes prevail. The Taliban's Islamic courts and religious po-
 lice, the Ministry for the Promotion of Virtues and Suppression of Vice (PVSV), en-
 forced their extreme interpretation of Islamic punishments, such as public execu-
 tions for adultery or murder and amputations of one hand and one foot for theft.
 For other infractions, Taliban militiamen often decided right or wrong and meted
 out punishments such as beatings on the spot. Various factions infringed on citizens'
 privacy rights. Both Taliban and anti-Taliban forces were responsible for the indis-
 criminate bombardment of civilian areas. Masood's forces have continued rocket at-
 tacks against Kabul. Civil war conditions and the unfettered actions of competing
 factions effectively limited the freedoms of speech, press, assembly, association, reli-
 gion, and movement. Years of conflict have left over 300,000 Afghans as internally
 displaced persons, and more than 2.6 million live outside the country as refugees.
 Although the continued fighting has discouraged many refugees from returning to
 their country, 88,000 returned between January and October.
 The human rights situation for women was extremely poor. Violence against
 women remained a problem throughout the country, and women were subjected to
 rape, kidnaping, and forced marriage. Trafficking in women and girls was a prob-
 lem. The treatment of women and girls continued to deteriorate. There was wide-
 spread discrimination against women and girls, especially in areas under Taliban
 control. The Taliban imposed strict dress codes and prohibited women from working
 outside the home except in limited circumstances in the health care field. Girls gen-
 erally were prohibited from attending school, particularly in Kabul and other urban
 areas. The Taliban allowed only a few girls' schools to operate in rural areas and
 small towns, as well as in camps for internally displaced persons at Kandahar and
 Herat. Worker rights were not defined. Child labor persists.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-Taliban forces committed a large
 number of political and other extrajudicial killings. In July there were unconfirmed
 reports that the Taliban executed large numbers of civilians during fighting with
 the National Islamic Movement of Afghanistan (NIMA) in Faryab province. There
 also were credible reports of mass killings of civilians and prisoners by the Taliban
 during and after the capture of Mazar-i-Sharif on August 8. Accurate statistics re-
 garding the number of persons killed after the takeover of Mazar-i-Sharif are not
 available, since no foreign observers or journalists were allowed into the area and
 there was no investigation of the events. However, the United Nations Special
 Rapporteur on Afghanistan, Human Rights Watch, and others estimated that as
 many as 2,000 to 5,000 persons may have been killed by the Taliban in Mazar-i-
 Sharif. In the hours after the takeover, the Taliban allegediy fired at anything that
 moved on the streets of Mazar or on the roads leading out of the city; many civilians
 reportedly were killed as they tried to flee the fighting or seek shelter. There were
 reports that during the days following the capture of the city, Taliban fighters sys-
 tematically searched for weapons and for ethnic Hazara men and boys, many of
 whom were beaten, killed on the spot, -or arrested by the Taliban. Tajik and Uzbek
 males were also allegedly targeted, but to a lesser extent. The new Taliban governor
 of Mazar-i-Sharif, Mulla Manon Niazi, did not allow relatives of the dead to collect
 the bodies from the streets for days after the takeover. Many of those arrested by
 the Taliban reportedly were detained in local jails, and then transported to other
 Taliban-controlled cities, such as Shibarghan, Herat, and Kandahar. In some cases,
 prisoners loaded onto trucks for transport out of Mazar died en route due to asphyx-
 iation or heat stroke. There were, reports that the Taliban fired rockets on and
 bombed the road leading south out of the city for at least 2 days after taking Mazar,
 killing an unknown number of fleeing civilians.
 Among those killed in the capture of Mazar-i-Sharif were eight Iranian diplomats
 and one Iranian journalist (see Section 2.a.). The bodies of six of the slain diplomats
 were returned to Iran in September, and the bodies of the other two diplomats and
 
 
 1849
 
 the journalist were returned in October. The Taliban admitted that its forces killed
 the diplomats, but claimed that those responsible acted on their own and would be
 punished by Taliban authorities.
 The massacre in Mazar-i-Sharif was reportedly aimed primarily against ethnic
 Hazaras, who are predominantly Shi'a Muslims. The new Taliban governor report-
 edly gave many anti-Shia, anti-Hazara speeches around Mazar-i-Sharif, some of
 which were broadcast over the radio, in the days following August 8. In these
 speeches, he threatened the Hazaras with violence for their part in the killing of
 Taliban soldiers in Mazar 1 year earlier. The Taliban, who are ethnic Pashtuns and
 Sunni Muslims, briefly captured Mazar-i-Sharif in 1997.
 On September 13, the Taliban took over the city of Bamiyan. In the fighting, an
 estimated 500 persons were killed, of whom- an estimated 200 were civilians. There
 were also credible reports of massacres by Taliban commanders of 45 civilians in
 a village near Bamiyan in September and of 300 civilians, including women and
 children, along the road from Qalat-i-Ghilzai to Ghami in Zabol province in Novem-
 ber. The Zabol province killings apparently were the work of a Taliban subgovernor
 in Shah Jui district, Haji Khalifa Sohaib, who robbed his victims before killing
 them. Sohaib reportedly was arrested after attacking a Taliban vehicle in Novem-
 ber. These massacres and earlier mass killings from 1997 have not been inves-
 tigated fully.
 Amnesty International has reported that the Taliban massacred 70 ethnic Hazara
 civilians, including children, in Qezelabad, near Mazar-i-Sharif, in September 1997.
 As many as 600 civilians reportedly were killed by retreating Tahban forces in
 Faryab province in December 1997.
 Independent investigations of these mass killings were hindered by the continuing
 warfare and the unwillingness of local commanders to allow investigators to visit
 the areas in question. The Taliban leadership has indicated in several of these cases
 that investigations were under way or that investigations would be permitted. How-
 ever, according to neutral observers, no real progress was made by the Taliban in
 facilitating investigations. The Taliban have not-rejected a U.N. proposal to station
 a civilian monitoring unit inside Afghanistan to help investigate the killings and
 serve as an early warning mechanism, but the proposal had not been implemented
 by year's end.
 Two Afghan U.N. employees were kidnaped on July 14 near Jalalabad and found
 murdered on July 19 and 20. The Taliban were implicated in the murder; the al-
 leged motive for the killings was the fact that the two were former members of the
 Communist Party. Other former Afghan communists, in both Afghanistan and Paki-
 stan, also were killed under circumstances that implicated the Taliban. Mohammad
 Hashim Paktianai, a cousin of former Afghan Communist President Najibullah (who
 was executed by the Taliban when they took Kabul in 1996), was killed by unidenti-
 fied gunmen near his home in Peshawar on November 2.
 The Taliban used swift summary trials and implemented strict punishments ac-
 cording to Islamic law; the Taliban ordered public executions, which sometimes took
 place before crowds of up to 30,000 persons at Kabul Stadium, and death by stoning
 (see Sections 1.c. and I.e.).
 The Taliban also used excessive force against demonstrators. On December 1, stu-
 dents at the Nangarhar medical college in Jalalabad reportedly protested their
 dean's misappropriation of hostel funds. When the dean was unable to get the stu-
 dents to disperse, he called his brother, Mullah Ayub, who is the commander of the
 local Taliban reserve force. When Mullah Ayub proved unable to convince the stu-
 dents to disperse willingly, he ordered his men to fire upon them. Two students re-
 portedly were killed and several were injured. The acting governor of Nangarhar
 province, Mawlawi Sadr Azam, criticized the shootings. Mullah Ayub and several
 others reportedly were arrested. However, the dean allegedly escaped. Taliban lead-
 er Mullah Omar ordered an investigation into the incident.
 During the year, Taliban planes bombed cities held by opposition forces. Opposi-
 tion forces also fired rockets into Kabul on a number of occasions. In many of these
 attacks, civilians were killed or injured (see Section 1.g.).
 In other areas, combatants sought to kill rival commanders and their sympathiz-
 ers. The perpetrators of these killings and their motives were difficult to identify,
 as political motives are often entwined with family and tribal feuds, battles over the
 drug trade, and personal vendettas.
 There were reports that as many as 2,000 Taliban soldiers were killed by the
 Northern Alliance, including the Hazara Hizb-i-Wahdat, near Mazar-i-Sharif as they
 retreated from the city in 1997. In December 1997, a U.N. team found several mass
 gravesites connected with the massacre of Taliban soldiers near Mazar-i-Sharif,
 which contained evidence consistent with mass executions.
 
 
 1850
 There were also unconfirmed reports that 10 unarmed demonstrators were killed
 in Mazar-i-Sharif on March 24. Forces loyal to the local Jamiat strongman, Com-
 mander Atta, allegedly shot at up to 3,000 pro-peace demonstrators. Atta may have
 feared that the crowd intended to storm his headquarters.
 On August 21, Lieutenant Colonel Carmine Calo, an Italian serving with the
 United Nations Special Mission, was killed in Kabul.
 b. Disappearance.-The strict security enforced by the Taliban in areas under
 their control has resulted in a decrease in abductions, kidnapings, and hostage tak-
 ing for ransom. However, there were allegations that Taliban maintained private
 prisons to settle personal vendettas and that they were responsible for disappear-
 ances in areas under their control. There were also credible reports that the Taliban
 detained hundreds of persons, mostly ethnic Hazaras, after the takeover of Mazar-
 i-Sharif in August; the whereabouts of many such persons was unknown at year's
 end (see Sections l.a. and 1.d.). There were unconfirmed reports that some Taliban
 soldiers abducted girls and women from Hazara neighborhoods in Mazar-i-Sharif in
 August; the whereabouts of some of these women were unknown at year's end (see
 Section 5).
 Abductions, kidnapings, and hostage taking for ransom or for political reasons oc-
 curred in non-Taliban areas, but specific information was lacking. There were
 unconfirmed reports that girls and local commanders were kidnaping young women.
 Some of the women were then reportedly forced to marry their kidnapers. Others
 simply remained missing. To avoid this danger, some families reportedly sent their
 daughters to Pakistan or to Iran.
 Groups in Russia listed nearly 300 Soviet soldiers formerly serving in Afghanistan
 as Inissing in action or prisoners of war (POW's). Most were thought to be dead or
 to have assimilated voluntarily into Afghan society, though some are alleged to be
 held against their will. A number of persons from the former Soviet Union missing
 from the period of the Soviet occupation are presumed dead.
 c. Torture and, Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 All Afghan factions are believed to have used torture against opponents and POW's,
 though specific information generally is lacking. Torture does not appear to be a
 routine practice in all cases.
 The Taliban ruled strictly in areas that they controlled, establishing ad hoc and
 rudimentary judicial systems. Taliban courts imposed their extreme interpretation
 of Islamic law and punishments following swift summary trials. Murderers were
 subjected to public executions, sometimes by throat slitting, a punishment that at
 times was infficted by the victims' families (see Section L.a.). Thieves were subjected
 to public amputations of either one hand or one foot, or both. The U.N. Special
 Rapporteur for Torture was particularly concerned about the use of amputation as
 a form of punishment by Taliban authorities. Adulterers were stoned to death or
 publicly whipped with 100 lashes. Those found guilty of homosexual acts were
 crushed by having walls toppled over them.
 Taliban forces beat women, using the pretext of immodest dress. There also were
 unconfirmed reports that Taliban members committed rapes (see Section 5).
 Some of Masood's commanders in the north reportedly used torture routinely to
 extract information from and break the will of prisoners and political opponents.
 Prison conditions are poor. Prisoners held by some factions are not given food, as
 normally this is the responsibility of prisoners' relatives, who are alowed to visit
 to provide them with food once or twice a week. Those who have no relatives have
 to petition the local council or rely on other inmates. Prisoners live in collective
 There are credible reports that torture occurred occasionally in prisons under the
 control of both the Taliban and the Northern Alliance. Local authorities maintain
 prisons in territories under their control and established torture cells in some of
 them. The Taliban operate prisons in Kandahar, Herat-, Kabul, Jalalabad, Mazar-
 i-Sharif, Pul-i-Khumri, Shibarghan, and Maimana. Masood maintains prisons in
 Panjshir and Taloqan, and there also is a prison in the north at Faizabad, in
 Badakhshan province. According to Amnesty International, there have been reports
 that some Taliban prisoners held by Masood were forced to labor in life-threatening
 conditions, such as digging trenches in mined areas.
 During 1998, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) registered al-
 most 4,400 prisoners of war across the country. Intensified fighting and poor secu-
 rity for foreign personnel limited the ICRC's ability to monitor prison conditions, es-
 pecially in and around Mazar-i-Sharif after that city fell to the Taliban. However,
 the ICRC's access improved toward the end of the year. The ICRC visited approxi-
 mately 8,000 detainees in 50 different places of detention in 1998.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-With the absence of formal-legal and law
 enforcement institutions, justice was not administered according to formal legal
 
 
 1851
 
 codes, and persons were subjected to arbitrary detention. There are credible reports
 that both Taliban and Northern Alliance militia extorted bribes from civilians in re-
 turn for their release from prison or freedom from arrest. Judicial and police proce-
 dures varied from locality to locality. Little is known about the procedures for tak-
 ing persons into custody and bringing them to justice. In both Taliban and non-
 Taliban areas, the practices varied depending on the locality, the local commanders,
 and other authorities. Some areas have a more formal judicial structure than others.
 There are reliable reports that individuals were detained by both the Taliban and
 Northern Alliance because of their ethnic origins and suspected sympathy with op-
 ponents. Ethnic Hazara, who are overwhelmingly Shi'a, reportedly were targeted in
 particular by the overwhelmingly Sunni and ethnic Pashtun Taliban forces. There
 were reports of mass arrests by the Taliban in Hazara neighborhoods of Kabul in
 January, and in Mazar-i-Sharif in August, where Taliban commanders reportedly
 conducted systematic house-to-house searches in Hazara areas (see Section L.a.).
 The Taliban reportedly took hundreds of noncombatants prisoner after their capture
 of Mazar-i-Sharif, apparently for use as hostages.
 The Taliban also detained dozens of Iranians captured during the takeover of
 Mazar. Iranian prisoners held by the Taliban were returned to Iran by the end of
 October with ICRC assistance.
 In October there were reports that the Taliban arrested dozens of persons in
 Jalalabad; estimates ranged from 25 to 400 persons detained. Those detained alleg-
 edly were arrested for planning to carry out a coup or other activities against the
 Taliban; however, the arrests appeared to be aimed at possible opposition figures
 and included tribal elders, intellectuals, members of various parties or groups, and
 persons associated with prior regimes. Some of those detained allegedly were re-
 leased after a few days when no evidence could be found against them.
 All factions probably hold political detainees, but no firm numbers are available.
 Thousands of prisoners of war are held by the Taliban and Masood. The Taliban
 claimed to have freed thousands of prisoners during the past few years. Masood re-
 portedly holds a number of Pakistanis, along with several hundred Taliban soldiers,
 as POW's. Prisoner releases by all factions occurred during the year, often with the
 assistance of the ICRC. Generally, small numbers of prisoners were released at any
 given time. However, on July 21, the ICRC assisted in an exchange of 140 prisoners
 between Masood and the Taliban. An independent Afghan entrepreneur, Syed Jalal,
 also successfully brokered the release of at least 500 prisoners held by the two sides.
 On December 5, to mark the month of Ramadan, the Taliban unilaterally released
 118 mostly elderly men from Pul-i-Charkhi prison in Kabul.
 There was no information available on forced exile.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-With no functioning nationwide judicial system,
 many municipal and provincial authorities relied on some interpretation of Shari'a
 (Islamic) law and traditional tribal codes of justice.
 The Taliban have Islamic courts in areas under their control to judge criminal
 cases and resolve disputes. These courts meted out punishments including execution
 and amputation. These courts reportedly heard cases in sessions that lasted only a
 few minutes. The courts reportedly dealt with all complaints, relying on the
 Taliban's interpretation of Islamic law and punishments as well as traditional tribal
 customs (see Section 1.c.). In cases involving murder and rape, convicted prisoners
 generally were ordered executed, although relatives of the victim could instead
 choose to accept other restitution (see Section l.a.). Decisions of the courts were re-
 portedly final.
 Little is known about the administration of justice in the areas controlled by
 Rabbani/Masood in the north. The administration and implementation of justice
 varied from area to area and depended on the whims of local commanders or other
 authorities, who summarily execute, torture, and mete out punishments without ref-
 erence to any other authority.
 All factions probably hold political prisoners, but no firm estimates of numbers
 are available.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-Inter-
 factional fighting often resulted in the homes and businesses of civilians being in-
 vaded and looted by the opposing forces-whether victor or loser. Armed gunmen
 reportedly acted with impunity given the absence of any legal protection from the
 law or a responsive police force. It also was unclear what authority controlled the
 actions of the Taliban militiamen who patrolled the streets of cities and towns. A
 number of incidents were reported in which Taliban soldiers or persons
 masquerading as Taliban entered private homes without prior notification or in-
 formed consent in Kabul, Herat, Kandahar, and elsewhere. In Kabul, the soldiers
 allegedly were searching homes for evidence of cooperation with the former authori-
 ties or for violations of Taliban religious-based decrees, including the ban on the
 
 
 1852
 
 possession of depictions of living things (photographs, stuffed animals, dolls, etc.).
 embers of the Ministry for the Promotion of Virtues and Suppression of Vice, the
 Taliban's religious police, beat individuals on the streets for infractions of Taliban
 rules concerning dress, hair length, and facial hair,- as well as for the violation of
 the prohibition on women being in the company of men who were unrelated to them.
 The Taliban required women to wear a burqa, a shroud-like outer garment that
 completely covers a woman from head to toe, when in public (see Section 5). Men
 are required to have beards of a certain length, not to trim their beards, and to wear
 head coverings. Men whose beards did not conform to the guidelines on beard length
 set out by the Taliban were subject to imprisonment for 10 days and mandatory Is-
 lamic instruction. The Taliban also reportedly have required parents to give their
 children "Islamic" names.
 There were reports that some prisoners of the Taliban, including young sons of
 families that had opposed Taliban social restrictions, had been drafted forcibly and
 sent to the front. In January there were unconfirmed reports that the Taliban, in
 attempting to conscript forcibly young men in the Arghandab district near
 Kandahar, sparked low-level armed resistance among local residents. There were
 also unconfirmed reports in 1997 that youths were rounded up and sent into com-
 bat.
 In August the Taliban prohibited satellite dishes, as part of -an effort to ban
 music, television, and movies (see Section 2.a.).
 There have been reported instances of the forcible expulsion of persons on ethnic
 grounds (see Section 5).
 g. Use of Excessive Force and Violations of Humanitarian Law In Internal Con-
 flicts.-In August the Taliban captured Mazar-i-Sharif. There were reports that as
 many as 5,000 persons, mostly ethnic Hazara civilians, were massacred by the
 Taliban after the takeover of Mazar. On September 13, the Taliban took over the
 city of Bamiyan. In the fighting, an estimated 200 civilians were killed. There were
 also credible reports, of a massacre by Taliban commanders of 45 civilians in a vil-
 lage nearBamiyan in September (see Section L.a.).
 In February Taliban planes dropped six bombs on Taloqan, reportedly killing 17
 civilians. Taliban jets bombed Pul-i-Khumri on March, 29; the. Northern Alliance
 claimed that five persons were killed. In May the Taliban bombed Taloqan again,
 with one bomb exploding in a crowded market. Thirty-one persons were killed and
 50 were injured, according to press reports. In August Taliban air raids against
 Bamiyan allegedly killed 13 persons and injured many more. In October Taliban
 planes bombed Charikar, killing 10 members of 1 family and wounding several
 other persons. On November 11, the Taliban bombed Taloqan yet another time, in
 the heaviest bombardment of the city to date.
 Amnesty International has reported on an alleged massacre of some 70 civilians
 of the Hazara ethnic group, including children, by Taliban forces in Qezelabad, near
 Mazar-i-Sharif, also in 1997. Retreating Taliban forces in Faryab province in late
 1997 reportedly killed some 600 civilians. There were also killings of civilians and
 prisoners by the Taliban as they advanced in Faryab province and captured Mazar-
 i-Sharif in August. Multiple witnesses reported a killing spree on the initial day of
 the Taliban's invasion of Mazar-i-Sharif, with Taliban soldiers shooting anything
 that moved on the streets, including men, women, children, and animals.
 In general, independent investigations of alleged killings were hindered by con-
 tining warfare .and the unwillingness of local commanders to allow investigators
 to visit the areas in question (see Section l.a.). The Taliban denied charges that its
 forces massacred or committed atrocities against civilians and claimed that civilian
 deaths, if any, resulted from combat.
 Masood's forces, the Jamiat-i-Islami, fired rockets on Kabul on a number of occa-
 sions, including on February 3 and 4, May 22, June 3 and 25, September 20, and
 December 13. Noncombatants were killed in most of these attacks. In May, eight
 persons reportedly were injured in a rocket attack. On June 3, six persons were
 led and several reportedly were injured. On September 20, the bloodiest attack,
 three rockets hit the city, with each rocket causing casualties. One of these three
 rockets hit the crowded residential area of Kart-i-Parwan and reportedly killed over
 100 persons. More than 25 persons were killed in the December attack. The appar-
 ent objective of the attacks was the airport, which.the Taliban were using for both
 military and civilian purposes. In March warring Northern Alliance factions in
 Mazar-i-Sharif pounded each other's positions inside the city -with heavy artillery;
 Afghan news sources reported that some civilians tried to flee. ,
 The discovery of mass graves near Shibarghan in the northern part of the country
 in 1997 was widely reported. The graves allegedly contained 2,000 corpses, report-
 edly those of Taliban forces captured near Mazar-i-Sharif in mid-1997 and executed
 by Northern Alliance forces.
 
 
 1853
 
 The Taliban-imposed blockade of food and other supplies bound for the Hazarajat
 region ruled by Hezb-i-Wahdat caused severe suffering among the I million inhab-
 itants of the region (see Section 2.d.). Many families left the area following the
 Taliban's refusal to lift the blockade, further adding to the problem of internal dis-
 placement. The U.N. succeeded in delivering some food after the Taliban loosened
 their blockade of the area in May, although the Taliban have been accused by the
 U.N. of plundering these food aidstocks immediately after their takeover of the re-
 gion. The U.N. conducted a mission to Bamiyan in November to assess the food situ-
 ation and to press the Taliban for return of the looted supplies.
 There were reports during the year that Masood's commanders in the northeast
 were "taxing" humanitarian assistance entering Afghanistan from Tajikistan,
 harassing NGO workers, obstructing aid convoys, and otherwise hindering the
 movement of humanitarian aid (see Section 4).
 Over 300,000 Afghans remain internally displaced following years of fighting.
 More than 2.6 million others have sought refuge abroad.
 The Afghan countryside remains plagued by an estimated 5 to 7 million land
 mines sown during and since the Soviet occupation. The mines covered an estimated
 707 square kilometers at the end of 1998, causing injuries, restricting areas avail-
 able for cultivation, and slowing the return of refugees. The laying of new mine
 fields by both sides exacerbated an already difficult situation. From 1995 to 1997
 new mines are believed to have been laid over 150 square kilometers of land, report-
 edly mostly by the Northern Alliance. An estimated 400,000 Afghans have been
 killed or wounded by the mines. Approximately 80 percent of the land mine casual-
 ties are civilian and 40 to 50 percent are women and children. Casualties are esti-
 mated at 10 to 12 per day caused by land mines or unexploded ordinance. With
 funding from international donors, the United Nations has organized and trained
 mine detection and clearance teams, which operate throughout the country. Never-
 theless, the mines are expected to pose a threat for many years. In 1997 the 4,000
 mine clearers suffered from an accident rate of I per week. However, clearance rates
 and safety have increased for clearance teams assisted by dogs. There were reports
 of some continuing mine laying by warring factions, although the head of the
 Taliban, Mullah Omar, reportedly banned the use, production, trade, and stock-
 piling of mines in October. U.N. agencies and nongovernmental organizations
 (NGO's) have instituted a number of mine awareness campaigns and educational
 programs for women and children in various parts of the country, but many were
 curtailed as a result of Taliban restrictions on women and girls. On October 23, it
 was reported that 41 persons were killed on the way to a wedding when the truck
 they were riding in hit a mine on an uncleared road in Kandahar.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-There are no laws that effectively provide for
 freedom of speech and of the press. Senior officials of various warring factions alleg-
 edly attempted to intimidate journalists and influence their reporting. The few
 newspapers in the country, all of which were published only sporadically, were for
 the most part affiliated with different factions. Various factions maintain their own
 communications facilities. The Taliban selectively ban the entry of foreign news-
 papers into their territory. Many foreign books are prohibited. The Taliban radio
 station, the Voice of Shariat, broadcasts religious programming and Taliban pro-
 nouncements.
 All factions have attempted to pressure foreign journalists who report on the Af-
 ghan conflict. The Taliban initially cooperated with members of the international
 press who arrived in Kabul, but later imposed restrictions upon them. During the
 year, foreign journalists were forbidden to film or photograph persons or animals,
 were not allowed to interview women, and were required to be accompanied at all
 times by a Taliban escort to ensure that these restrictions were enforced. Foreign
 journalists were not permitted into Mazar-i-Sharif after the Taliban took the city
 in August. In 1997 Abdurrahman Hotaqi, the Taliban's Deputy Minister of Informa-
 tion, warned foreign journalists that the Taliban would not tolerate "biased and
 false analysis".
 The Taliban reportedly require most journalists to stay at the Intercontinental
 Hotel in Kabul (allegedly for security and economic reasons). Journalists also re-
 ported that the Taliban attempted to control who could act as drivers and inter-
 preters for journalists.
 In August Iranian journalist Mahmoud Saremi was killed after being abducted in
 Mazar-i-Sharif by Taliban soldiers (see Section l.a.). Saremi was the Afghanistan
 bureau chief for the official Iranian news agency, IRNA. Taliban officials stated that
 those responsible for Saremi's killing were not acting under official orders and
 would be punished.
 
 
 1854
 On October 30, five foreigners were arrested in Kandahar for taking photographs
 of the home of Taliban leader Mullah Omar.
 The Taliban continue to prohibit music, movies, and television on religious
 grounds. In   August television  sets, videocassette recorders, videocassettes,
 audiocassettes, and satellite dishes were outlawed in order to enforce the prohibi-
 tion.
 The Taliban severely restrict academic freedom, particularly education for girls
 (see Section 5).
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-Civil war, tenuous security,
 und likely opposition from local authorities seriously inhibited freedom of assembly
 and association.
 It is unknown whether laws exist that govern the formation of associations. Many
 domestic NGO's continue to operate in the country, and many international NGO's,
 some without their foreign staff, also continue to operate in the country (see Section
 4). There were reports that the Taliban require NGO's to go through burdensome
 registration procedures in order to be allowed to operate, and attempted to exert
 control over NGO staffing and office locations, especially in Kabul.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-Freedom of religion is restricted severely, and Taliban
 members vigorously enforced their interpretation of Islamic law. Afghanistan's offi-
 cial name, according to both the Taliban (Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan) and the
 Northern Alliance (the Islamic State of Afghanistan), reflects the desire of the fac-
 tions to promote Islam as a state religion. Some 85 percent of the population is
 Sunni Muslim, and Shi'a Muslims constitute most of the remainder. The Hazara
 ethnic group is predominantly Shi'a; Shi'as are among the most economically dis-
 advantaged persons in the country. The Shi'a minority want a national government
 to give them equal rights as citizens. There are reports that the Taliban have occu-
 pied and "cleaned" Shi'a mosques for the use of Sunnis.
 The Taliban sought to impose their extreme interpretation of Islamic observance
 in areas that they control. Prayer is mandatory for all, and those who are observed
 not praying at appointed times or who are late attending prayer are subject to pun-
 ishment with severe beatings. Members of the Ministry for the Promotion of Virtues
 and Suppression of Vice, which was raised to the status of a ministry in May, regu-
 larly check passersby to see that men's beards and apparel meet Taliban require-
 ments, to ensure that women are dressed in strict traditional Taliban-approved
 garb, and to ascertain that women are not in the company of men who are unrelated
 to them (see Section 5). There were reports that the PVSV members in Kabul
 stopped persons on the street and quizzed them to determine if they knew how to
 recite various-Koranic prayers. According to regulations, a man who has shaved or
 cut his beard may be imprisoned. Beards must protrude farther than would a fist
 clamped at the base of the chin. Several civil service employees reportedly were
 fired in 1997 for cutting their beards. All students at Kabul University are report-
 edly required to have beards in order to study there (no female students are al-
 lowed). There also are credible reports that Taliban members gave forced haircuts
 to males in Kabul. Enforcement of Taliban social strictures is much stricter in the
 cities, especially Kabul. The Taliban have declared that all Muslims must abide by
 the Taliban's interpretation of Islamic law.
 The small number of non-Muslim residents in Afghanistan may practice their
 faith, but may not proselytize. Almost all of the country's small Hindu and Sikh
 population, which once numbered about 50,000, has emigrated or taken refuge
 abroad. There were reports that Hindus are now required to. wear a piece of yellow
 cloth attached to their clothing to identify their religious identity; Sikhs reportedly
 were required to wear some form of identification as well. This rule allegedly was
 imposed to spare non-Muslims from the enforcement of rules that are mandatory
 for Muslims and from harassment by the PVSV.
 In November Taliban -officials accepted responsibility for the defacing of one of two
 historic statues of Buddha near Bamiyan during their takeover of that city in Au-
 gust. The Taliban claimed that the vandalism was the result of an unauthorized act
 by one of their soldiers, and that the statutes were being protected by the Taliban
 from further harm. In 1997, there was a report that a Christian church in Kabul
 was taken over by Taliban authorities and turned into a mosque. Some Taliban
 leaders claimed tolerance of religious minorities, although there reportedly have
 been restrictions imposed -upon Shi'a Muslims in Taliban-controlled territory,
 though not on a uniform basis.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-Although in principle citizens have the right to travel freely both inside
 and outside the country, their ability to-travel within the country was hampered by
 warfare, brigandage, millions of-land mines, a road network in a state of disrepair,
 and limited domestic air service, complicated by factional threats to air traffic. The
 
 
 1855
 
 Taliban's restrictions on women further curtail freedom of movement (see Section
 5). Despite these obstacles, many persons continued to travel relatively freely, with
 buses plying routes in most parts of the country. However, due to intermittent fight-
 ing in various areas, international aid agencies often found that their ability to trav-
 el, work, and distribute assistance was hampered. International travel continued to
 be difficult as both the Taliban and Masood threatened to shoot down any planes
 that flew over areas of the country that they controlled, without their permission.
 Commercial trade was impeded in certain non-Taliban areas, as local commanders
 continued to demonstrate their control over the roads by demanding road tolls and
 sometimes closing roads. The Taliban enforced a blockade of food and other supplies
 bound for the Hazarajat region of central Afghanistan, but allowed limited humani-
 tarian shipments beginning in May and abandoned the blockade when the regional
 capital, Bamiyan, came under Taliban control in August. There was increasing evi-
 dence throughout the year that some Taliban commanders, who previously gained
 popularity by sweeping away the checkpoints that local warlords used to shake
 down travelers, are setting up checkpoints themselves and demanding tolls for pas-
 sage.
 There also have been instances of the forcible expulsion of individuals on ethnic
 grounds. During the year, there were reports of forced expulsions of ethnic Hazaras
 and Tajiks from areas newly occupied by the Taliban.
 Afghans continued to form one of the world's largest refugee populations. Accord-
 ing to the United Nations High Commission for Refugees, about 2.6 million Afghans
 remain outside the country as registered refugees: 1.4 million in Iran, 1.2 million
 in Pakistan, 20,000 in Russia, 17,000 in India, and 9,000 in the central Asian repub-
 lics. Women and children constitute 75 percent of the refugee population. In'addi-
 tion, there are more than 300,000 Afghans who are internally displaced following
 years of fighting. A total of 4,069,000 Afghan refugees have been repatriated since
 1988, with over 1.5 million returning to Afghanistan in the peak year of 1992. Al-
 though the continued fighting has discouraged many refugees from returning to
 their country, 88,000 returned between January and October.
 There was no available information on policies regarding refugees, asylum, provi-
 sion of first asylum, or the forced return of refugees.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 There was no functioning central government in the country. The continuing
 struggle for political power among the major armed groups prevented citizens from
 changing their government or choosing their leaders peacefully and democratically.
 Most political changes came about through shifting military fortunes. No faction
 held elections or respected citizen's right to change their government democratically.
 The Taliban movement's authority emanates from its leader, Mullah Omar, who
 carries the title Commander of the Faithful. Governmental functions are exercised
 through the key Taliban governing body, the Inner Shura (Council) based in
 Kandahar, and by.ministries based in Kabul.
 The Northern Alliance, headed by nominal President Rabbani, holds power with
 de facto Defense Minister Masood as Rabbani's primary military backer. Rabbani
 received nominal support from General Dostam, and the Shi'a/Hazara Hezb-i-
 Wahdat, before their forces were defeated by the Taliban during the year. Rabbani
 and Masood control the northeastern, largely Tajik, portion of the country, including
 the strategic Panjshir valley north of Kabul.
 Discontent with the Taliban's strictures and rural village values was strong in
 large, non-Pashtun cities such as Herat and Kabul, and in the cities controlled by
 the Taliban in the north. The Taliban's military successes did not encourage the
 group's leaders to engage meaningfully in political dialog with opponents. Efforts to
 convene a national body of Muslim scholars (ulema) to discuss the future of the
 country broke down when both the Taliban and the Northern Alliance disagreed
 over the possible membership and sequence of the talks. Peace talks convened in
 April in Islamabad, Pakistan broke down quickly. Moderate and neutral Afghans,
 mostly living outside of the country, continue their efforts to organize a traditional
 Grand National Assembly (loya jirga), and held a meeting in Germany in July.
 Other expatriate Afghan moderates have attempted to enlist the former King in this
 process.
 The United Nations and the international community continued their efforts to
 help Afghans reach a political settlement.

 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 There are many NGO's, both domestic and international, in the country. Some are
 based in neighboring countries, mostly Pakistan, with branches inside Afghanistan;
 others are based in Afghan cities. The focus of their activities is primarily humani-
 tarian assistance, rehabilitation, health, education, and agriculture.
 There was harassment of domestic and international NGO's by all factions. The
 Taliban have interfered consistently with the operation of the United Nations and
 NGO's. Tactics used have included threatening to impound the vehicles of NGO's
 that do not work on projects preferred by the Taliban, threatening to close projects
 down that do not include a Taliban member as a supervisor, and, in the case of one
 domestic NGO, detaining the NGO's director and impounding all of its equipment
 in order to get 'the NGO to surrender its equipment, hire Taliban members, and
 cede half of the seats on its board to the Taliban. The Taliban announced in March
 that foreign Muslim women, including U.N. workers, would be allowed to perform
 their jobs only if accompanied by a male relative, a move that hampered NGO and
 relief operations. The United Nations withdrew its personnel from southern Afghan-
 istan in late March to protest the assault of a U.N. worker by the Taliban governor
 of Kandahar province and the interference with its work by the Taliban. After
 reaching agreements with local officials, the U.N. returned to Kandahar in May. In
 April Taliban authorities rejected the participation of U.N. Humanitarian Coordina-
 tor Alfredo Witschi-Cestari on the U.N. tea selected to negotiate with the Taliban
 on the travel restrictions for foreign Muslim women and other issues, because he
 was perceived-to be "anti-Taliban".
 On June 30, the Taliban insisted that Kabul NGO's abandon their offices and
 move to a single location in a bomb damaged former school, which had no electricity
 or running water. Those who refused were threatened with expulsion from the coun-
 try. However, the relocation was not enforced by the Taliban before foreign U.N. and
 NGO staff left the country in August due to security concerns. In- June and July,
 several Afghan workers for international NGO's were detained for questioning by
 the Taliban; most were released within a few days. On July 14, two Afghan U.N.
 workers were abducted by unidentified persons in Jalalabad; their bodies were
 found on July 19 and 20. One of the bodies bore signs of torture (see Section l.a.).
 On August 21, Lieutenant Colonel Carmine Calo, an Italian serving with the United
 Nations Special Mission, was killed in Kabul (see Section l.a.), triggering the depar-
 ture of most foreign U.N. and NGO staff. Some Afghan staff remained to carry out
 humanitarian operations. In November the U.N. World Food Program (UNWFP),
 which distributes food aid, accused the Taliban of looting 1,500 metric tons of food,
 stealing 6 trucks from the UNWFP's compound in Bamiyan, and occupying UNWFP
 offices in Bamiyan and Yakaolang. That same month, the Taliban agreed to a visit
 by the U.N. to Bamiyan to discuss the situation. The visit took place on November
 23-24.
 For much of the year, Northern Alliance and autonomous commanders also pre-
 vented NGO's and international organizations from delivering humanitarian assist-
 ance from the north to Bamiyan by road, despite the fact that the area was suffer-
 ing from a Taliban-imposed blockade. There are 6redible reports that Masood-affili-
 ated commanders obstructed NGO's and international organizations in delivering
 humanitarian assistance in the northeastern provinces of Badakhshan and Takhar;
 they allegedly "taxed" or overcharged for the delivery of humanitarian supplies
 across the Amu Darya river -frm Tajikistan, laid new land mines on the roads, and
 blew up a bridge used by NGO's to deliver assistance to Badakhshan. Occasionally,
 local commanders held up convoys and aid workers.
 The Afghan League of Human Rights operated both in Afghanistan and Pakistan;
 it produces an annual report. The Cooperation Center for Afghanistan (CCA) is an
 Afghan NGO that operated in both Pakistan and Afghanistan. The CCA maintains
 an office in Peshawar, where it produces a monthly newsletter on the Afghan
 human rights situation. It also monitors and documents the human rights situation
 from several offices in both Taliban-controlled and Northern Alliance controlled cit-
 ies. The National Commission on Human Rights in Afghanistan began operations
 during the year in Pakistan, conducting seminars on human rights issues, issuing
 press statements criticizing specific instances of human rights abuses, and placing
 articles in Pashtu and Dari newspapers. The Afghanistan Commission for Human
 Rights, founded in 1997 after discussions with Taliban authorities on Islamic as-
 pects ofhuman rights, also started activities in Pakistan, focused on the plight of
 Aghan prisoners in Pakistani prisons and on children's rights. However, the civil
 war and lack of security continued to make it difficult for human rights organiza-
 tions to monitor adequately the situation inside Afghanistan.
 
 
 1857
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 There is no functioning constitution, and therefore there are no constitutional pro-
 visions that prohibit or protect against discrimination based on race, sex, religion,
 disability, language, or social status. It is not known whether specific laws prohibit
 discrimination; local custom and practices generally prevail. Discrimination against
 women is prevalent throughout the country, and its severity varies from area to
 area, depending on the local leadership's attitude towards work and education for
 women and on local attitudes. Historically, the minority Shi'a faced discrimination
 from the majority Sunni population. There has been greater acceptance of the dis-
 abled as the number of persons maimed by land mines increased and the presence
 of the disabled became more widespread.
 Women.-As lawlessness and interfactional fighting continued in some areas, vio-
 lence against women occurred frequently, including beatings, rapes, forced mar-
 riages, disappearances, kidnapings, and killings. Such incidents generally went un-
 reported andmost information was anecdotal. It was difficult to document rapes,
 in particular, in view of the social stigma that surrounds the problem. Although the
 stability instituted by the Taliban in most of the country initially acted to reduce
 violence against women, Taliban members continued to beat women, using the pre-
 text of immodest dress. There were also unconfirmed reports that Taliban soldiers
 raped and abducted women from Hazara neighborhoods in Mazar-i-Sharif in Au-
 gust; the whereabouts of some of these women were unknown at year's end. The
 enforced seclusion of women within the home greatly limited the information avail-
 able on domestic violence and marital rape. In a climate of secrecy and impunity,
 it is likely that domestic violence against women remained a serious problem.
 Women accused of adultery offenses also are subjected to violence. At least one
 accused adulteress was sentenced to 100 lashes; her sentence was carried out pub-
 licly (see Section l.c.).
 Beginning under the monarchy in the 1960's, and at an increasing pace under
 President Mohammed Daoud in the 1970's and the Communist regime in the 1980's,
 a growing number of women, particularly in urban areas, worked outside of the
 home in nontraditional roles as doctors, nurses, and teachers. This trend was re-
 versed when the Communists were ousted in 1992 and an Islamic government was
 installed. Since the advent of the Taliban in 1994, the trend towards excluding
 women from employment has intensified, and only a few women worked as artisans,
 weavers, doctors, and nurses in some areas outside of Taliban control. Girls' schools
 also remained open in areas outside of Taliban control.
 The treatment of women under Taliban rule has been particularly harsh. When
 the Taliban took Kabul in September 1996, they immediately issued pronounce-
 ments forbidding girls to go to school and forbidding women to work, including fe-
 male doctors and nurses in hospitals. In a few cases, the Taliban relented and al-
 lowed women to work in health care occupations under restricted circumstances.
 The prohibition on women working outside of the home has been especially difficult
 for the large numbers of widows leift by 20 years of civil war, there are an estimated
 30,000 widows in Kabul alone. Many women reportedly have been reduced to selling
 all of their possessions and to begging to feed their families. Taliban gender restric-
 tions continued to interfere with the delivery of humanitarian assistance to women
 and girls, as well. In 1997 the Taliban asked that international assistance be pro-
 vided to women through their close male relatives rather than directly. Male rel-
 atives also must obtain the permission of the Ministry for the Promotion of Virtues
 and Suppression of Vice for female home-based employment.
 While most Afghans lack any access to adequate medical facilities, such access
 was made even more restrictive for women under Taliban rule. In 1997 the Taliban
 announced a policy of segregating men and women in hospitals and directed most
 hospitals in Kabul to cease services to women and to discharge female staff. Services
 for women were to be provided by a single hospital still partially under construc-
 tion-a drastic reduction in access to, and the quality of, health care for women.
 Several orders concerning the provision of emergency and non-emergency medical
 aid for women were given and reversed in 1997. Women were permitted to seek
 treatment from female medical personnel working in designated women's wards or
 clinics; they were permitted to see male doctors if accompanied by a male relative.
 Erratic reversals in policy continued throughout 1998, with the effect that women
 often were prevented from obtaining adequate medical care. On June 25, the
 Taliban prohibited all doctors from treating female patients in the absence of the
 woman's husband, father, or brother. This decree, while not universally enforced,
 made treatment extremely difficult for Kabul's widows, many of whom have lost all
 such male family members. Further, even when a woman is allowed to be treated
 by a male doctor, he may not see or touch her, which drastically limits the possibil-
 
 
 1858
 
 ity of any meaningful treatment. Health care for both men and women also was
 hampered by the ban on images of humans, which caused the destruction of public
 education posters and hampered the provision and dissemination of health informa-
 tion in a society with massive illiteracy.
 In 1998 Physicians for Human Rights (PHR) conducted a survey of 160 Afghan
 women in Kabul and in Pakistan, and found that 77 percent reported poor access
 to health care in Kabul, while another 20 percent reported no access at all. Of those
 surveyed, 71 percent reported a decline in their physical condition over the last 2
 years. In addition, there, was also a significant decline in the mental health of the
 women surveyed. Of the participants, 81 percent reported a decline in their mental
 condition; 97 percent met the diagnostic criteria for depression; 86 percent showed
 symptoms of anxiety; 42 percent met the diagnostic criteria for post-traumatic stress
 disorder;, and 21 percent reported having suicidal thoughts "extremely often" or
 "quite often." There have been unconfirmed reports that the suicide rate among
 women in Kabul has increased significantly since the Taliban takeover of the city.
 The Taliban decreed what women could wear in public. Women were forced to don
 a head-to-toe garment known as the burqa, which has only a mesh screen for vision.
 While in some rural areas this was the normal garment for women, the requirement
 to wear the burqa represented a significant change in practice when imposed in
 urban areas. According to a decree announced by the religious- police in 1997,
 women found outside the home who were not covered properly would be punished
 severely along with their family elders. In Kabul and elsewhere women found in
 public who were not wearing the burqa, or whose burqas did not properly cover
 their ankles, were beaten by Taliban militiamen. Some poor women cannot afford
 the cost of a burqa, and thus are forced to remain at home or risk beatings if they
 go out without one. The lack of a burqa has resulted in the inability of some women
 to get necessary medical care; at least one woman reportedly died because she did
 not have a burqa and thus could not leave her home. In its survey, PHR found that
 22 percent of the respondents reported being detained and abused by the Taliban;
 of these incidents, 72 percent were related to alleged infractions of the Taliban's
 dress code for women. Most of these incidents reportedly resulted in detentions that
 lasted 1 hour or less, but 84 percent also resulted in public beatings and 2 percent
 resulted in torture. -Sixty-eight percent of those surveyed reported that they had
 drastically reduced their public activities during the past year in Kabul. A few re-
 ports in 1997 indicated that some women in Herat cover their heads with large
 scarves that leave the face uncovered and have not faced reprisals, and many
 women in rural areas also have been observed without burqas but with scarves cov-
 ering their heads. Women are not allowed to wear white burqas, white socks or
 white shoes. Women reportedly were beaten if their shoe heels clicked when they
 walk. All of these restrictions apparently are not enforced strictly upon the nomad
 population of several hundred thousand or upon the few female foreigners, who
 nonetheless must cover their hair, arms and legs. Women in their homes must not
 be visible from the street; the Taliban require that houses with female occupants
 have their windows painted over.
 Women were expected to leave their homes only while escorted by a male relative;
 further curtailing the appearance and movement of women in public even when
 wearing approved clothing. Women appearing in public without a male relative ran
 the risk of beatings by the Taliban. Some observers reported seeing fewer and fewer
 women on the streets in Taliban-controlled areas. Women are not allowed to drive,
 and taxi drivers reportedly are beaten if they take unescorted women as passengers.
 Women only may ride on buses designated as women's buses; there are reportedly
 not enough such buses to meet the demand, and the wait for women's buses can
 be long. In December the Taliban ordered that bus drivers who take female pas-
 sengers must encase the bus in curtains, and put up a curtain so that the female
 passengers cannot see or be seen by the driver. Bus drivers also were told that they
 must employ boys under the age of 15 to collect fares from female passengers, and
 that neither the drivers nor the fare collectors were to mingle with the passengers.
 Women are also forbidden to enter mosques or other places of worship; most
 women pray at home, usually alone.
 In September Taliban leader Mullah Omar issued edicts that outlawed tribal cus-
 toms of compelling widows to marry their in-laws and forcing women to marry to
 settle disputes between families. He also affirmed women's limited rights to inherit
 property under the Taliban's interpretation of Islamic law.
 In April a car carrying three foreign women allegedly was rammed intentionally
 by a truck bearing the white Taliban flag. In Jalalabad, Taliban officials reportedly
 tried to keep female journalists from walking in a public bazaar, out of concern for
 their safety.
 
 
 1859
 Children.-Local administrative bodies and international assistance organizations
 undertook to look out for children's welfare to the extent possible; however, the situ-
 ation of children is very poor. Infant mortality is 250 out of 1,000 births and
 Medecins Sans Frontiers reports that 250,000 children per year die of malnutrition.
 The Taliban's restrictions on cross-gender medical treatment have had a detrimental
 effect on children. According to PHR, children sometimes are denied medical care
 when the authorities do not let male doctors visit children's wards, which may be
 located within the women's ward of a hospital, or will not allow male doctors to see
 children accompanied only by their mothers. A UNICEF study also reported that
 the majority of children are highly traumatized and expect to die before reaching
 adulthood. Some 90 percent have nightmares and suffer from acute anxiety, while
 70 percent have seen acts of violence, including the killing of parents or relatives.
 Taliban restrictions on the movement of women and girls in areas that they con-
 trolled hampered the ability of U.N. agencies and NGQ's to implement effectively
 health and education programs aimed at both boys and girls.
 The Taliban have eliminated most of the opportunities for gis' education that ex-
 isted in areas that they have taken over, however, some girls' schools still operate
 in rural areas and small towns. More than 100 NGO-funded girls' schools and home-
 based women's vocational projects were closed in Kabul on June 15. The Taliban
 stated that schools would not be allowed to teach girls over the age of 8, and that
 the schools that were closed had violated this rule. In the future, the Taliban stated
 that it would license girl's schools, and that teaching in such schools would be lim-
 ited to the Koran. Some girls reportedly are receiving an education in informal home
 schools, which are tolerated by the Taliban authorities in various parts of the coun-
 try. It also is reported that several girls' schools remain open in Kandahar, although
 in Herat, which was captured by the Taliban in 1995, girls' schools have remained
 closed except in the refugee camps maintained by international NGO's. Some fami-
 lies sent girls abroad for education in order to evade the Taliban's prohibitions on
 females attending school in most urban areas. Prior to the Taliban takeover in 1996,
 more than 100,000 girls reportedly attended public school in Kabul in grades kin-
 dergarten to 12, according to a U.N. survey. It has also been reported that the ban
 on women working outside of the home has hampered the education of boys, since
 70 percent of the country's teachers were women prior the advent of Taliban rule.
 The Taliban have banned certain recreational activities, such as kite flying and
 playing chess. Dolls and stuffed animals are prohibited due to the Taliban's inter-
 pretation of religious injunctions against representations of iving beings. Mullah
 Omar reportedly issued a dcree in November banning young men and boys who
 have not yet grown a beard from fighting at the front.
 People With Dsabilitis.-There are few measures to protect the rights of the
 mentally and physically disabled or to mandate accessibility for them. Victims of
 land mines continued to be a major focus of international humanitarian relief orga-
 nizations, which devoted resources to providing prostheses, medical treatment, and
 rehabilitation therapy to amputees. It is believed that there was more public accept-
 ance of the disabled because of the prevalence of them due to land mines or other
 war-related injuries. There are reports that disabled women, who need a prosthesis
 or other aid to walk, are virtually homebound because they cannot wear the burqa
 over the prosthesis or other aid.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-It is estimated that thousands of members
 of the ethnic Hazara minority may have been killed by the Taliban (see Section
 l.a.).
 There have been instances of the forcible expulsion of individuals on ethnic
 grounds. During the year, there were reports of forced expulsions of ethnic Hazaras
 and Tajiks from areas newly occupied by the Taliban.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Little is known about labor laws and practices, al-
 though only an insignificant fraction of the work force has ever labored in an indus-
 trial setting. There were no reports of labor rallies or strikes. Labor rights are not
 defined, and in the context of the breakdown of governmental authority there is no
 effective central authority to enforce them. Many of Kabul's industrial workers are
 unemployed due to the destruction or abandonment of the city's minuscule manufac-
 turing base. The only large employer in Kabul is the governmental structure of
 minimally functioning ministries.
 Workers in government ministries reportedly have been fired because they have
 received part of their education abroad or because of contacts with the previous re-
 gimes, although certain officials in previous administrations still are employed
 under the Taliban. Others reportedly have been fired for violating Taliban regula-
 tions concerning beard length.
 
 
 1860
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Afghanistan lacks a tradition
 of genuine labor-management bargaining. There are no known labor courts or other
 mechanisms for resolving labor disputes.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Little information is available on
 forced or compulsory labor, including child labor. There have been credible reports
 that Masood forced Taliban prisoners to work on road and airstrip construction
 projects.
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and. Minimum Age for Employment.-There is
 no evidence that authorities in any part of the country enforce labor laws, if they
 exist, relating to. the employment of children. Children from the ages of 6 to 14 often
 work to help support their families by herding animals in rural areas, and by col-
 lecting paper and firewood, shining shoes, begging, -or collecting scrap metal among
 street debris in the cities. Some of these practices expose children to the danger of
 land mines.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-There is no available information regarding a
 statutory minimum wage or the enforcement of safe labor practices. Many workers
 apparently are allotted time off regularly for prayers and observance of religious
 holidays.
