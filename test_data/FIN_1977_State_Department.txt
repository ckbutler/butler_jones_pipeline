 objectives, publicly and privately. Finland is a
 signatory of the UN convention on refugees. The
 international covenant on civil and political rights,
 and the covenant on economic, social and cultural
 affairs.

 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 Freedom from torture is guaranteed by law and respected
 in practice.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Freedom from cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or
 punishment is guaranteed by law and respected in
 practice.
 c. Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 Freedom from arbitrary arrest or imprisonment is
 guaranteed by law and respected in practice.
 d. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 ,Finnish law allows that persons accused of certain
 crimes, such as espionage, may be tried in secret.
 This is rarely employed, and when it is, all basic
 rights enjoyed in open trials are scrupulously
 observed.
 e. Invasion of the Home
 Freedom from invasion of the home is guaranteed by law
 and respected in practice.
 2. Governmental policies relating to the fulfillment
 of such vital needs as food, shelter, health care
 and education
 In the field of social justice, Finland's record is on
 a par with other Nordic states and among the best in
 the world. The government is committed to economic
 policies aimed at maximizing employment opportunities
 and to the fairest possible distribution of income.

 3. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, including:
 a. Freedom of Thought, Speech, Press, Religion and
 Assembly
 These freedoms are in effect.
 b. Freedom of Movement, Foreign Travel and
 Emigration
 There is freedom of movement, foreign travel and
 emigration
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 All other civil and political liberties are respected and
 protected under Finnish law. Basic human rights are
 guaranteed in chapter II of the Finnish constitution of
 1919. Labor is free to organize, and the labor movement
 is well developed and politically influential.
 There are Finnish statutes which, on their face, are not
 wholly consistent with Finland's general position of
 strong commitment to human rights. For example, a 1948
 statute provides a maximum of two years imprisonment for
 persons who intentionally and publicly defame a foreign
 state, and thereby jeopardize Finland's relations with
 that state. This law, however, has never been used.
 4. Government Attitude and Record Regarding
 International and Non-governmental Investigation
 of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The Finnish government is open to any outside
 investigation of possible human rights violations,
 although this has not been, and is unlikely to be
 necessary given Finland's exemplary performance in the
 field. For ten years there has been a Finnish chapter
 of amnesty international, which'now has some 500 members.
