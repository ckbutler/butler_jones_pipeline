 CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC
 The Central African Republic became a democracy in 1993 following free and fair
 elections in which Ange Felix Patasse, candidate of the Movement for the Liberation
 of the Central African People, was chosen President. Citizens also elected an 85-
 member National Assembly; no party holds a majority. In 1994 a Constitution pro-
 viding for multiparty democracy was accepted in a national referendum. The judici-
 ary is subject to executive interference.
 In January following the killing of two French military officers by rebel troops,
 French troops seized key installations in and around the cities of Lakouanga and
 Bimbo, effectively ending the latest in a series of 1996 rebellions by forces opposed
 to the Patasse Government. A January 25 accord formally ended the November 1996
 mutiny. President Patasse appointed Michel Gbezera-Bria as Prime Minister and es-
 tablished the Government for the Defense of Democracy. It included beth the ruling
 party and members of the opposition political coalition. The African Mediation Coa-
 lition sent an Inter-African peacekeeping force, MISAB, to the capital, Bangui, in
 late January. MISAB established a procedure for reintegration of ebels at Camp
 Kasai and collection of weapons distributed by rebels to civilians. In June rebel fac-
 tions attacked MISAB troops, renewing the violence in the Bangui area. In fighting
 during late June, 500 persons were killed and 70,000 civilians were forced to flee
 the area. In July talks mediated by Amadou Toumani Toure, a former president of
 Mali, resulted in an agreement between the Government and the mutineers that
 ended the June mutiny.
 Military forces, the National Gendarmerie under the Minister of Defense, the Na-
 tional Research and Investigation Force (CNRI), the civilian police force, share in-
 ternal security responsibilities under the direction of the Minister of Public Security.
 After the 1996 mutinies, the Presidential security guard increased in size and re-
 sponsibility. MISAB helps maintain order in the capital. Security forces committed
 serious human rights abuses. Some members of MISAB also committed serious
 abuses.
 The Central African Republic is a landlocked and sparsely populated country,
 most of whose inhabitants practice subsistence agriculture. Annual per capita gross
 domestic product is estimated at $357. Principal exports are coffee, cotton, timber,
 tobacco, and diamonds. The military and civil unrests during the year resulted in
 further significant decreases in public revenues and higher unemployment.
 The Government's human rights record remained poor, and serious human rights
 abuses continued in certain areas. There were credible reports of routine summary
 executions of suspected bandits by security forces, and of the death of prisoners due
 to security force abuse. Police torture and beatings of detainees and prisoners con-
 tinued. The President in March granted amnesty to the rebel forces for acts that
 they had committed during the November 1996 mutiny. The Government did not
 prosecute members of the armed forces who were accused of abuses during any of
 the 1996 mutinies. It granted amnesty to participants in the November 1996 mu-
 tiny. Other human rights abuses included harsh prison conditions, arbitrary arrest,
 prolonged detention without trial, limits on judicial independence, infringements on
 citizens' right to privacy, restrictions on freedom of assembly, some limits on free-
 dom of religion, restraints on press freedom to criticize the Government, a pattern
 of discrimination and violence against women, female genital mutilation, and dis-
 crimination against Pygmies.
 In March President Patasse granted amnesty to former senior officials of the
 Kolingba regime who were charged with corruption. These people had been held in
 detention for an extended period.
 According to credible sources, members of the Chadian contingent of the MISAB
 reportedly committed human rights abuses, including the killing of civilians and the
 looting of residences.
 Many human rights abuses were reported in the areas controlled by the rebels.
 Rebel forces were responsible for killings, disappearances, robberies, carjackings,
 rape, arson, and other abuses committed against civilians.
 
 
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no known political
 killings (former Interior Minister Grelombe was killed by unknown persons during
 the November mutiny). There were credible reports that the army and the gendar-
 merie routinely executed suspected bandits and other persons.
 In May three former rebels, arrested for the alleged killing of a presidential guard
 and his wife were killed while in the custody of the gendarmerie. Opposition parties
 accused the Presidential Guard and some military personnel of this killing which
 took place in gendarmerie headquarters; the Government conducted a judicial inves-
 tigation, but results have notbeen released. The Government did not prosecute
 members of the security forces for these or other killings. Approximately 10 pris-
 oners died in custody at the police antibanditry station in Bangui in connection with
 repression of banditry, according to the Central African Republic Human Rights
 League (see Section 1.c.).
 Gendarmes and military loyalists dispersed a December 1996 demonstration, kill-
 ing and injuring many protesters (see Section 2.a.).
 die   reportedly killed an estimated 200 persons during the four mutinies.
 President Patasse granted amnesty to all soldiers who had mutinied in April, May,
 and November. The Government neither investigated nor prosecuted members of
 the armed forces for the killings and other reported abuses committed during the
 1996 military mutinies.
 Rebel forces killed numerous persons, often targeting, torturing, and killing civil-
 ians (see Section 1.g.).
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Although the Penal Code prohibits torture ana specifies sanctions for those found
 guilty of physical abuse, the police continue to beat and otherwise abuse criminal
 suspects an dp risoners. At one police station, police reportedly tortured and abused
 all the individuals detained. Members of the securi  orces also tortured and beat
 journalists (see Section 2.a.). Many deaths of prisoners due to official abuse were
 reported to the courts by family members and by the Human Rights League execu-
 tive committee, with no evident official response taken. In May, three former rebels
 died in the custody of the gendarmerie (see Section l.a.). The August-September
 1996 National Conference on Defense (Etats-Ceneraux) recommended the abolition
 of special secret plice units due to abusive treatment of detainees and their oper-
 ation as a paralel and secret army outside the normal enforcement structure. There
 was no further government action on this recommendation.
 Rebel forces use&torture and rape, particularly against civilians (see Section 1.g.).
 Prison conditions are extremely harsh. Cells are overcrowded, and the basic neces-
 sities of life, including food, clothing, and medical care, are in short supply. Avail-
 able supplies are reportedly routinely diverted to prison officials for their personal
 use. Prisoners are frequently forced to perform uncompensated labor at the resi-
 dences of government officials. Male and female prisoners are confined in separate
 facilities in Bangui but housed together elsewhere. Minors are routinely housed
 with adults and subjected to physical abuse. The infamous Ngaragba prison is still
 in use despite promises in 1996 to construct a new facility.
 The Government permits prison visits by human rights monitors.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention or Exile.-The law provides for protection against
 arbitrary arrest and detention, but security forces often ignore these prvisions.
 The law stipulates that persons detained in cases other than those involving na-
 tional security must be brought before a magistrate within 96 hours. In practice,
 the authorities often do not respect this deadline, in part due to inefficient judicial
 procedures. Judicial warrants are not required for arrest. By law, national security
 detainees, defined as "those held for crimes against the security of the State," may
 be held without charge for up to 2 months. Previous governments used the national
 security prvision of the law to arrest their opponents. The Patasse Government has
 not detained political opponents under this provision, although presidential guards
 arbitrarily arrested people suspected of support of the mutineers; they were released
 within days. Presidential guards also arrested the editor of an independent news-
 paper (see Section 2.a.).
 oonged pretrial detention is a problem. Roughly one-half the male prison popu-
 lation are pretrial detainees. Officials of the Kolingba regime (1981-1993), who had
 been officially charged with corruption and in some cases detained more than 18
 months without trial, were released during the November 1996 mutiny. In late
 March, as required by the Bangui Accords, President Patasse granted amnesty to
 those officials  arell rebels. According to the Government prosecutor, about 100 ci-
 
 
 vilians arrested by the gendarmes and security guards and accused of participating
 in the rebellion were also released under the pressure of the International Follow-
 up Committee.
 The law does not permit the use of exile, and the Government has not employed
 it in practice. The Government has repeatedly stated that any person in exile for
 strictly political, rather than criminal, reasons may return without fear of persecu-
 tion. At the end of the year, there were no known political self-exiles.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution provides for an independent judi-
 ciary, but there are reliable reports of periodic executive interference.
 The judiciary, which consists of regular and military courts, was reorganized in
 the 1994 Constitution. Legislation implementing this reorganization was enacted in
 1996. New courts of justice were created during the year in bth urban and rural
 areas.
 In criminal cases, the accused are presumed innocent and have the right to legal
 counsel, to public trial, to be present at their trials, and to confront witnesses. The
 Government generally respects these safeguards in practice, but inefficient adminis-
 tration of the law, shortages of trained personnel, and material resources hinder the
 process. The criminal court, for example, did not convene for 3 years for lack of
 money. The Constitutional Court also has not yet met for lack of office facilities.
 Court proceedings are open to the public and broadcast on national radio.
 A July meeting on the reconciliation and reintegration of the former rebels into
 the army, chaired by General Amadou Toumani Toure, addressed many abuses in
 the military justice system and established recommendations for long-term improve-
 ment. No action had been taken on recommendations made at a similar meeting in
 1996.
 There were no reports of political prisoners, although some observers note that
 anticorruption statutes at times appear to have been applied more rigorously to offi-
 cials of the Kolingba regime than to current officials.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Government on rare occasions abused the law that prohibits invasion of homes with-
 out a warrant in civil and criminal cases. Police did, however, use provisions of the
 Penal Code governing certain political and security cases that allow them to search
 private property without special authorization. The Government also monitored the
 telephones of some opposition figures and cut their telephone lines during the 1996
 mutinies. In January security guards, operating of the orders of the Government,
 cut the telephone lines of former Prime Minister Ngoupande and his director of
 staff, Karim Meckassoua.
 g. Use of Excessive Force and Violations of Humanitarian Law In Internal Con-
 flicts.-During the four mutinies from April 1996 to June 1997, both loyalist and
 insurgent factions in the rebellion inflicted more harm on noncombatants than on
 each other. Both deliberately targeted, tortured, and killed civilians, ransacked vil-
 lages in areas under their control, and confiscated goods and food supplies. Most vil-
 lagers took refuge in the forest. According to the President of the Human Rights
 Observatoire, some loyalists based in Mbaiki tortured, raped, and killed civilians.
 At year's end, the Government had not punished anyone for the offenses. Some
 members of the MISAB also committed such abuses (see Section l.a.).
 In late June, rebels attacked MISAB troops based in the controlled areas and sub-
 jected residents of Bangui to a week of shooting, bombing, and heavy mortar fire.
 Several buildings in the southern section of the capital were destroyed. Rebels with-
 out military uniforms used civilians as human shields. The June 20-27 fighting be-
 tween MISAB and the rebels resulted in the heaviest loss of life of the four rebel-
 lions. According to the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), 500 per-
 sons died in the conflict and 70,000 were driven from their homes. Many took refuge
 in rural areas north and west of Bangui. Media witnesses and human rights groups
 reported that MISAB soldiers disregarded citizens' human rights.
 In January after the killing of two French military officers, French troops at-
 tacked the rebels using heavy artillery in the neighborhoods of Lakouanga and
 Petevo. An estimated 100 civilians were killed during these actions, and thousands
 fled to a safe area north of the capital, according to ICRC officials. Many people
 were arrested and jailed at the Presidential Guard headquarters under inhuman
 conditions.
 Chadian members of the MISAB force allegedly committed violent crimes in Fat-
 ima, Petevo, and elsewhere. Former Communication Minister Felix Bougalama was
 killed in front of his home in Bangui at this time. A Catholic priest in the Fatima
 church reported the killing of old people, children, and women by soldiers wearing
 MISAB uniforms. Residents and others alleged that the Chadian contingent was re-
 sponsible. During a press interview, the MISAB commander denied these allega-
 tions, suggesting that criminal elements had masqueraded as MISAB members.
 
 
 There were incidents in which local residents attired as MISAB members committed
 violent crimes.
 The rebels attacked the women's jail in Bimbo and reportedly raped 20 women.
 Witnesses reported that in the village of Nzila the rebels killed civilians and buried
 their bodies. They also destroyed private residences, hospitals, factories, and gas
 stations in the neighborhoods of Petevo and Bimbo, forcing the non-Yakomas to
 leave. They erected, barricades across the major roads of Petevo and Boganda, re-
 stricting the free passage of the local population and humanitarian organizations
 such as the ICRC and the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). Rebels
 reportedly restricted free access to the major hospitals. This resulted in women and
 infants dying for lack of medical care. The population had no access to the public
 cemetery in N'dres near Camp Kasai, where the bodies of the victims were report-
 edly buried.
 Parallel state military forces, such as security guards (SERD, CNRI) and some po-
 litical militia (Karako) reportedly used excessive force and committed other abuses.
 Civilians were killed based on their ethnicity.
 In the November 1996 mutiny, the rebels organized civilians into city guerrilla
 groups. They reportedly forcibly recruited hundreds of teenagers and younger boys
 and distributed uns to the recruits and other civilians. According to credible re-
 ports, these newly organized groups committed a number of killings and robberies
 during the mutiny.
 The ICRC reported that there were several hundred killed and wounded and
 70,000 displaced in June. The June fighting ended with the unconditional surrender
 of the rebels. Rebels signed the cease-fire and returned most heavy weapons and
 guns to the French army under the auspices of the International Follow-up Commit-
 tee and submitted by returning to their barracks. The MISAB forces had some suc-
 cess in disarming civilians as a result of the efforts of neighborhood leaders, reli-
 gious groups, and some NGO's. Some civilians returned guns and ammunition.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech
 and the press. Although the Government generally allows the press to operate free-
 ly, it restricts press freedom to criticize the Government.
 Citizens speak freely and publicly, criticizing the Government, the President's
 handling of certain issues, and political parties. Opposition leaders, in particular,
 use press statements, manifestos, and copies of open correspondence to the Govern-
 ment, to circulate their views. During the year, not all of this documentation was
 published by the government-controlled media. However, the Government made no
 apparent effort to censure, seize, or halt printing and circulation of these materials
 elsewhere.
 More than a dozen private newspapers were published over varying intervals;
 only four were published on a regular basis during the year. These newspapers were
 often outspoken in their criticism of the President, the Government, corruption, and
 economic policies. They openly discussed a wide variety of views on political and so-
 cial issues. The Government sued several newspapers following accusations of cor-
 ruption published by their newspapers. Many journalists regarded this as official
 harassment.
 During the mutinies, private journalists were harassed and persecuted by govern-
 ment security guards who accused them of being manipulated by the opposition. In
 February Richard Bagouma, editor of Nikpa, was kidnaped by security guards. He
 was beaten, tortured, and later released, following pressure from human rights ob-
 servers and political parties. Jean-Rigobart Maka Gbossokoto, editor and publisher
 of the satirical La Tortue Dechainee, was threatened with death by government se-
 curity guards. His articles had severely criticized the management of the Govern-
 ment and its policies.
 The editor of the independent Le Novateur was arrested by Presidential Guards
 and detained for 5 days without charge. He was subsequently rearrested by the
 CNRI, accused of defamation, tried, and sentenced to 3 months' imprisonment for
 having published an article on the arbitrary detentions and abuses committed by
 the Presidential Guards.
 Television and radio included weekly programs that provided an opportunity for
 those political parties represented in the National Assembly to present their views.
 The opposition welcomed this new access to the public media. The Government owns
 and controls one newspaper, Acap Bulletin, which appears only sporadically. A wire
 service news bulletin and a radio and television station operated more regularly.
 A private radio station, Africa No.1, is based in Libreville, Gabon and has been
 operating since 1995. A church-affiliated station began oprations the same year.
 Radio France Internationale began broadcasting in June. The opposition parties are
 
 
 free to establish private stations but lack the money to do so. Although its formation
 had been announced in 1994, the Government has still not yet set up the High
 Council of Communication to regulate the management of private media and help
 enforce press ethics; a bill for its creation was pending in Parliament at year's end.
 The Government does nt impede foreign journalists in their work.
 The Government respects academic freedom. University faculty and students be-
 long to many political parties and express their views without fear of reprisal.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 the right of assembly, but the Government at times has restricted this freedom. A
 1992 decree requires organizers of demonstrations and public meetings to register
 with the Government 48 hours in advance and also prohibits political meetings in
 schools or churches. The Government forbade public assembly and demonstrations
 in the aftermath of the April 1996 military revolt. No similar order was issued after
 the May or November 1996 crises, or during the June mutiny. Gendarmes and mili-
 tary loyalists dispersed a December 1996 demonstration by civilians, rebels, and
 politicians who supported the rebellion demanding the resignation of president
 atasse. The gendarmes used tear gas and guns, reportedly killing four protesters
 and injuring several others (see Section l.a.).
 The Constitution provides for freedom of association and the Government gen-
 erally respects this right in practice. Associations are required to register with the
 Government to enjoy legal status. All political parties must register with the Min-
 istry of Public Security in order to participate legally in politics. The Government
 usually grants registration expeditiously.
 There are more than 25 registered political parties and a variety of nonpolitical
 associations. The Government allows them to hold congresses, elect officials, and
 publicly debate policy issues without interference.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of religion, but in-
 cludes fixed legal conditions and prohibits what the Government considers religious
 fundamentalism and intolerance. A 1994 constitutional provision prohibiting reli-
 gious fundamentalism is widely understood to be aimed at Muslims. There is no
 state religion, and a variety of religious communities are active. Religious organiza-
 tions and missionary groups are free to proselytize, worship, and construct places
 of worship. However, religious groups must register with the Government. Any
 group whose behavior the Government considers subversive remains subject to sanc-
 tions, although the authorities imposed no sanctions during the y ear.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-People are free to move within the country, but police and other offi-
 cials harass travelers unwilling or unable to pay bribes at checkpoints along major
 intercity roads and at major intersections in Bangui. Some citizens, when attempt-
 ing to leave the country, were informed by immigration authorities that their names
 were on unspecified official lists that forbade their departure. For example, in Feb-
 ruary former Prime Minister Jean-Paul Ngoupande and his adviser and chief of
 staff, Karim Meckassoua were refused permission, for political reasons, to board an
 airplane to Paris to visit their families. After pressure from members of the diplo-
 matic corps, the international press, and the Tuman Rights League, the authorities
 authorized them to leave the country.
 During the military crisis the city of Bangui was divided in two parts. People in
 the rebels' area in the southwest were not free to leave that sector. They were also
 harassed for bribes by the rebels at checkpoints.
 The Government continued to work with the office of the UNHCR in hosting
 Chadian, Sudanese, Rwandan and Congolese refugees. Most refugees were reg-
 istered with the National Commission for Refugees. Most Chadian refugees returned
 to Chad. Many had been accused of criminal activity in the Central African Republic
 and were targeted by the rebels during the military crisis. Applicants for asylum
 are generally well-treated and often accepted. The issue of first asylum did not arise
 during the year.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens exercised their constitutional right to change their government by demo-
 cratic means in 1993 through presidential and parliamentary elections. Inter-
 national observers deemed the elections free and fair. In 1995, for the first time in
 its history, the Parliament passed a vote of censure against the Government.
 The Constitution provides for multiple political parties and increased the powers
 and independence of the legislative and judicial branches at the expense of the exec-
 utive branch. The Government did not schedule local elections for 1994 due to budg-
 et restrictions. Since then, for financial reasons, the Government a ppointed four suc-
 cessive mayors of Bangui, which resulted in criticism from prodemocratic groups
 
 
 that the Government was reneging on the constitutional requirement to have local
 elections.
 Of the 85 parliament members, three are women. Three of the 26 cabinet mem-
 bers are women. There are no Muslims in the Government. About 10 Muslims serve
 in the National Assembly.
 Pygmies (Ba'aka), who re present from 1 to 2 percent of the national population,
 are not represented in the Government and have little political power or influence,
 although they voted in large numbers in the 1993 election.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The Central African Human Rights League (LCDH) is a nongovernmental organi-
 zation with multiple goals, including publicizing human rights violations and plead-
 ing individual cases of human rights abuses before the courts. The LCDH distrib-
 uted its pamphlets describing individuals' rights and information on judicial access
 to the prisons, at police stations, courts, schools, and other NGO's.
 In the April-May 1996 mutinies the LCDH played an important role as a mediator
 to help safeguard democratic institutions. In a letter to the President and govern-
 ment authorities, the LCDH criticized the Government's harassment of the press,
 excessive pretrial detentions in violation of the law, summary executions of sus-
 pected bandits, and other deaths of suspects while in police custody in Bangui. Sev-
 eral other NGO's, including the Movement for the Defense of Human Rig ts and
 Humanitarian Action and some religious groups, actively monitor human rights
 problems. Their activities include prison visits and assistance to civilians during the
 armed conflicts. The Central African Red Cross played a notable role during the mu-
 tinies. Despite difficulties caused by the rebels, the volunteers of Red Cross worked
 under fire to assist wounded persons, deliver babies, and provide humanitarian aid
 to thousands. They also assisted in counting and burying bodies in rebels areas. The
 Government did not attempt to hinder any such activities.
 There were no known requests from international human rights organizations for
 visits.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution stipulates that all persons are equal before the law without re-
 ard to wealth, race, sex, or religion, but the Government does not effectively en-
 ?orce these provisions, and significant discrimination exists.
 Womnen.-Violence against women, including wife beating, occurs but inadequate
 data makes it impossible to quantify its extent. Victims seldom report incidents. The
 courts try vey few cases of spousaabuse, altbough litigants cite these abuses dur-
 ing divorce trials and civil suits. Some women reportedly tolerate abuse in order to
 retain a measure of financial security for themselves and their children. The Gov-
 ernment did not address this problem during the year.
 Despite the Constitution's prvisions, in practice women are treated as inferior to
 men economically, socially, and politically. Women in rural areas, moreover, suffer
 more discrimination than women in urban areas. Sixty to 70 percent of urban fe-
 males go to primary school, while only 10 to 20 percent of their rural counterparts
 do. Overall, at the primary level, females and males enjoy equal access to education,
 but the majority of young women drop out at age 14 or 15 due to social pressure
 to marry and bear children. Only 20 percent of the students at the University of
 Bangui are women. There are no accurate statistics on the percentage of female
 wage earners.
 Polygyny is legal, although this practice faces growing resistance among educated
 women. The law authorizes a man to take up to four wives, but a prospective hus-
 band must indicate at the time of the marriage contract whether he intends to take
 additional wives. In practice many couples never formally marry because men can-
 not afford the traditional bride payment. Women who are educated and financially
 independent tend to seek monogamous marriages. Divorce is legal and may be initi-
 ated by either partner. The law does not discriminate against women in inheritance
 and property rights, but a welter of conflicting customary laws often prevails. The
 1995 draft family code, designed to strengthen women's rights, still awaits National
 Assembly approval.
 The Association of Central African Female Jurists' Clinic advises women, of their
 legal rights. The organization also publishes pamphlets in conjunction with the Min-
 istry of Social Affairs on the dangers of female genital mutilation (FGM) and on food
 taboos.
 Children.-Although there is no official discrimination against children, the Gov-
 ernment spends little money on programs for children. There are few church and
 
 
 56
 other NGO projects for youth. Most children are behind in their studies because of
 teachers' strikes in the early 1990's and the army mutinies. Education is compulsory
 beyond the age of 5, but parents are not prosecuted for truancy. Many Bangui street
 children survive by begging and stealing. Some are street vendors, part of the infor-
 mal economy. Several charitable organizations strive to assist them.
 Courts interpret the Penal Code as forbidding parental blows or injuries to chil-
 dren under age 15. The proposed family code is designed to strengthen children's
 rights. For example, illegitimate children would have the same rights as those born
 in wedlock.
 A 1996 ordinance banned female genital mutilation (FGM), which is widely con-
 demned by international health experts as damaging to both physical and psycho-
 logical health. Nevertheless, this traditional practice is found in certain rural areas,
 and to a lesser degree in Bangui, and is performed at an early age. Approximately
 45 to 50 percent of females have undergone FGM. A campaign of awareness orga-
 nized by the Ministry of Social Welfare and women's NGO's reduced the incidence
 of FGM in some rural areas.
 People With Disabilities.-There is no codified or cultural discrimination against
 the disabled. There are several government-initiated programs designed to assist
 the disabled, including handicraft training for the blind and the distribution of
 wheelchairs and carts by the Ministry of Social Services. There is no legislated or
 mandated accessibility for the disabled.
 Indigenous People.-Despite constitutional provisions, in practice some minorities
 are treated unequally. In general, the country's indigenous Pygmies have little abil-
 ity to participate in decisions affecting their lands, culture, traditions, and the allo-
 cation of natural resources. In particular, indigenous forest-dwelling Pygmies are
 subject to social and economic discrimination and exploitation, which the Govern-
 ment has done little to correct. Pygmies often work for villagers at wages lower than
 those paid to members of other groups.
 Religious Minorities.-Muslims, particularly Mbororo (Peulh) herders, claim to
 have been singled out for harassment by authorities, including shakedowns by po-
 lice, due to popular resentment of their presumed affluence. Muslims play a prepon-
 derant role in the economy.
 National/Racial /Ethnic Minorities.-There are about 90 ethnic groups, and in the
 past there was little ethnic balance at the higher level of government. Under the
 olingba regime, members of the minority Yakoma ethnic group held a dispropor-
 tionate number of senior positions in Government, the armed forces, and state-
 owned firms. The Patasse Government has brought about a more representative
 ethnic balance in the Government. Even so, observers note that members of north-
 ern ethnic groups close to the President are a majority in Patasse's cabinet and also
 receive favorable treatment in government appointments. In the 1996 mutinies, se-
 curity forces killed civilians based on their ethnicity (see Section 1.g.).
 Under the various accords following the 1996 mutinies, reintegration of the rebel
 forces into the armed forces has included access to promotions or Yakoma soldiers
 that previously had been blocked since Patasse took office.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Under the Labor Code, all workers are free to form
 or join unions of their choosing without prior authorization. A relatively small part
 of the population has exercised the right of association, chiefly wage earners such
 as civil servants.
 The Labor Code does not refer to trade unions by name, a change from the pre-
 vious code. The International Labor Organization (ILO) had requested this change
 to reflect the proliferation of new unions. There are now five recognized labor fed-
 erations, including the Organization of Free Public Sector Unions and the Labor
 Union of Central African Workers (USTC). The USTC and its member unions con-
 tinue to assert and maintain their official independence from the Government.
 Unions have the right to strike in both the public and private sectors. To be legal,
 strikes must be preceded by the union's presentation of demands, the employer's re-
 sponse to these demands, a conciliation meeting between labor and management,
 and a finding by an arbitration council that union and employer failed to reach
 agreement on valid demands. The union must also provide 8 days' advance notifica-
 tion in writing of planned strikes. The Labor Code states that if employers initiate
 a lockout that is not in accordance with the Code, the employer is required to pay
 workers for all days of the lockout. Other than this, the Code does not provide for
 sanctions on employers for acting against strikers. It is not known to what extent
 this policy is actually followed.
 Labor federations are free to affiliate internationally. The USTC is affiliated with
 the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions.
 
 
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargai Colectively.-The Labor Code accords trade
 unions full legal status, includingthe right to sue in court. It requires that union
 officials be employed full-time in the occupation as a wage earner, but they nonethe-
 less conduct union business during working hours. The Code does not specifically
 provide that unions may bargain collectively. While collective bargaining has none
 theless taken place in some instances, tbe Government is usually involved in the
 process.
 Wage scales are set by the Ministry of Labor and Civil Service and were still in
 the process of revision at year's end. The nonpayment of salaries arrears and higher
 consumer costs attributed to the 1994 devaluation continued to be major complaints
 of the unions. The Government's efforts to reform the civil service were stalled dur-
 ing the civil strife. At year's end, the Government had resumed these reforms.
 The law expressly aorbid discrimination against employees on the basis of union
 membership or umion activity. The Labor Code does not state whether employers
 found guilty f antiunion discrimination are required to reinstate workers fired for
 union activities.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced labor is specifically prohib-
 ited by the Labor Code, and there were no reports of forced or bonded labor, except
 for prisoners who were forced to work without compensation for government officials
 or magstrates (see Section 1.c.). The law applies to children. However, the Govern-
 ment does not have sufficient resources to enfoc the prohibition effectively.
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment.-Employ-
 mentef children under 14 years of age is forbidden by law, but the provision is only
 loosely enforced by the Ministry of Labor and Civil Service. In practice child labor
 is common in many sectors of the economy, especially in rural areas.
 The Government prohibits forced and bonded labor by children and attempts to
 enforce the prohibitions, although resources to do so are inadequate (see section
 6.c.).
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The Labor Code states that the Minister of
 Labor must set minimum wages by decree. Agricultural workers are guaranteed a
 minimum of $15 (cfa 7,800) per month, while office workers are guaranteed $36 (cfa
 18,000). Minimum wages differ among the various sectors. The minimum wages
 assures a family the basic necessities but is barely adequate to maintain a decent
 standard of living. Most labor is performed outside the wage and social security sys-
 tem, especially by farmers in the large subsistence agricultural sector.
 The law sets a standard workweek of 40 hours for government employees and
 most private sector employees. Household employees may work up to 55 hours per
 week. The law also requires that there be a minimum rest period of 48 hours.
 There are also general laws on health and safety standards in the workplace, but
 the Ministry of Labor and Civil Service neither precisely dines nor actively en-
 forces them, a matter about which the ILO has expressed concern to the Govern-
 ment for many years. The Labor Code states that a labor inspector may force an
 employer to correct unsafe or unhealthy work conditions, but it does not provide the
 right for workers to remove themselves from such conditions.
