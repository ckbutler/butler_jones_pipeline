 LAOS
 The Government of the Lao People's Democratic Republic came to
 power in Vientiane in December 1975 and calls itself
 revolutionary-and socialist, basing its legitmacy on
 "Marxist-Lennist" ideology. Its leaders grew up under the
 political wing of Ho Chi Minh and remain dependent on
 Vietnamese and Soviet military and economic support to stay in
 control. Its efforts to accommodate itself to economic and
 political norms that it considers "Marxist-Leninist' give rise
 to an unsatisfactory human rights situation in Laos.
 The population of Laos is officially estimated at 3.8 million.
 The ethnically diverse peoples of Laos are thinly scattered
 over more than 91,000 square miles of generally rugged
 terrain. They share few common values. National institutions
 in Laos remain weak. There is no constitution or codified body
 of law. The Government has never even attempted to conduct
 'Leninist style' elections.
 Laos is an extremely poor and backward country. France
 controlled Laos until 1954, and it made only minimal
 development investments within Laos. Since 1954, Laos has
 found itself on the frontier of the communist and non-communist
 worlds and between major regional rivals, Thailand and
 Vietnam. As a result, parts of Laos were long fought over, and
 conflicting loyalties have produced a problem of serious
 internal factionalism. Today, continuing regional and domestic
 political tension, low-level guerrilla activity, and poor
 economic conditions contribute to a siege mentality and to an
 atmosphere of suspicion on the part of the narrowly-based Lao
 Government.
 The United Nations is investigating charges that
 biological/chemical weapons have been used against Hmong
 tribespeople in Laos by the Government or its communist
 backers. New organic evidence has brought greater credibility
 to these charges.
 Upon taking over in 1975, the new regime arrested significant
 numbers of royal Lao Government officials for "reeducation' in
 camps remote from the capital. Some of these officials died in
 captivity and others are still being held. Although many
 officials of the Royal Government remained at their posts
 through the transition and continue to do so, the arrests
 frightened numerous individuals and families of the small
 middle class, which also included Chinese and Vietnamese urban
 traders and artisans. Since 1975, there has been an exodus of
 over 300,000 persons (or nearly eight percent of the
 population). The departure of a significant number of the
 skilled middle class has held back economic progress.
 Given the Government's preoccupation with political and
 military security, the extremely small number of trained people
 available to it, and its mistrust of many of the educated
 persons who have remained in the country, it is not surprising
 that the Government's weak administrative structure has made
 little headway in solving many of the serious problems facing
 the country. The nation's mountainous geography, pronounced
 ethnic cleavages, and a general apathy among the populace with
 respect to their future economic well-being all make progress
 difficult.
 The Government, regarding itself as "revolutionary" and
 
 
 753
 claiming to be interested in the advance of whole classes of
 people, manifests little solicitude for individual human
 rights. The individual citizen is prey to the designs of the
 state and the Communist Party, as well as to capricious
 officials. Nothing resembling a bill of rights exists in
 Laos. Lao culture itself, however, has a broadly humane
 streak, and this factor tends to mitigate somewhat the problems
 faced by the individual. The communist takeover in Laos was
 accompanied by far less violence against traditional cultural
 values than was the case elsewhere in Indochina.
 There has, in recent years, been limited improvement in some.
 aspects of human rights in Laos, though very serious
 shortcomings persist. The Government has modified some of its
 restrictions on small business, and noticeably fewer
 individuals are removed for re-education. There also appears
 to be a recent increase in emphasis on satisfying consumer
 requirements.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Killing
 There are few cases of homicide resulting from passion or
 ordinary theft in this Theravada Buddhist country. There are,
 however, some reports of fatal shootings by Lao Government and
 Vietnamese patrols of persons seeking to flee to Thailand and
 of persons discovered attempting to enter Laos
 surreptitiously--usually smugglers or suspected resistance
 elements. There are also a number of people killed annually in
 combined Lao/Vietnamese military operations against resistance
 elements within the country. There are recurrent reports of
 attacks on vehicles bearing Government officials and ordinary
 buses in isolated areas which have involved killings. These
 are attributed to resistance elements, but--in the cases of
 attacks on buses--have also involved ordinary robberies.
 b. Disappearance
 Although there were numerous cases of secret arrest and
 undeclared removal to so-called re-education camps in the first
 two to three years of the present regime, disappearance has
 been reported only rarely in the last several years.
 c. Torture
 There have been no reports of torture for the past three years.
 d. Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 Refugees have reported that conditions in re-education camps
 for political prisoners vary from camp to camp, but all are
 primitive and have limited medical facilities and poor food.
 These sources state that the prisoners reportedly receive the
 same salary ($1.50 per month) as a private in the Lao army.
 Families are generally able to exchange letters with detainees;
 in some cases, wives are allowed to join husbands at the camps
 for extended periods. Former inmates report that punishment
 for misbehavior can include brutal public beatings, shackling,
 deprivation of food, and sometimes, for those who try to
 escape, execution. Lao government officials have publicly
 denied reports of mistreatment of persons in the re-education
 camps.
 
 
 754
 Laos also has normal prisons and prison work camps where those
 awaiting conviction or convicted of crimes are held, together
 with persons accused of undefined political offenses.
 Conditions are said to be spartan. There were a number of
 reports of capital punishment in the first years after 1975,
 but in the last two years reports indicate only a few such
 executions; these were for escape attempts from re-education
 camps and for treason and robbery. Official policy calls for
 execution of the leaders of resistance groups, but there have
 been no reports of executions in 1982.
 e. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 The Lao Government continues to maintain a multilayered system
 of re-education, rehabilitation, and labor camps throughout
 much of the country; figures on those incarcerated are
 unavailable. Not long after the establishment of the present
 r1egime, several thousand Lao citizens (as well as a few foreign
 residents) were arrested for their association with the
 previous Government or the United States. They were sent,
 without public hearing or trial, to remote camps for
 reeducation. These camps exhibit differing degrees of
 isolation and coercion, but here, too, precise information is
 lacking. No exact information is available on how many camps
 remain open or the population of those camps.
 The reeducation camps in Phong Saly were closed in early 1979
 and most of the camps' inmates released, thus reducing the
 number of those in captivity to some extent. Since then, at
 least two more camps have been closed. People continue to be
 released from the remaining camps, but some are then required
 to remain in remote parts of the country. There is said to be
 a 'special camp" located close to the Vietnamese border for
 persons who are resistant to re-education.
 Those accused of hostility to the regime or of socially
 undesirable habits (prostitution, drug abuse, idleness, and
 "wrong thought') are sent to rehabilitation centers, usually
 without trial, although Government regulations provide that a
 person may not be held for more than three months before
 charges are brought. Most of these persons have been allowed
 to return after periods ranging from a few months to several
 years of hard labor, political indoctrination, and admission of
 guilt. Under the Government's concept of justice and in the
 absence of a constitution or a codified body of law, those
 undergoing reeducation or rehabilitation are not necessarily
 charged with specific crimes.
 f. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The Lao have promulgated interim rules and regulations for the
 arrest and trial of those accused of specific crimes, including
 armed resistance to the Government. These regulations were
 disseminated to local authorities in October 1978, primarily to
 correct the haphazard way in which lower-level authorities were
 handling their criminal and judicial duties. Even if these
 regulations were always followed, however, they would provide
 no real opportunity for the accused to defend himself. Rather,
 the Government has issued instructions on how to investigate,
 prosecute, and punish wrongdoers. These instructions are
 applied capriciously. There is some provision for appeal, with
 the key exception that important political cases tried by
 people's courts are without appeal. Death sentences must be
 approved by the Council of Ministers.
 
 
 755
 Lao regulations call for judgment to be given in public. This
 constitutes, in effect, a public announcement of the sentence;
 it is not a public trial.
 The Ministry of Justice reportedly has been engaged in drafting
 a constitution, and there have been indications that the task
 may be nearing completion.
 g. Invasion of the Home
 Government regulations require orders from the prosecution
 department, Ministry of Justice, or from the concerned
 provincial prosecution service for search of private homes.
 The search is supposed to be conducted in front of the accused
 or other witnesses and a written inventory made of confiscated
 goods. Except in urgent cases, house searches are required to
 be conducted during the day. In practice, these limitations'
 are sometimes violated. Even in cases in which they are
 followed, they provide little protection from the individual
 since search and seizure are authorized by the security bureaus
 themselves rather than by an impartial judicial authority.
 Realizing that he has no guaranteed recourse under the law, a
 person whose home has been arbitrarily entered and searched
 will, if not arrested on the spot, often attempt to flee the
 country.
 2. Respect for Civil and Political Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Lao press is entirely government-controlled. It is
 described as an instrument for dissemination of government and
 party positions. Written or spoken opposition to the
 Government is not considered a legitimate activity. Some
 persons who have engaged in such activity have been jailed.
 Most Lao are intimidated by threats from the Government into
 avoiding discussions or associations with foreigners.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Assembly is entirely at the whim of the authorities and, except
 for religious and athletic events, occurs only at official
 behest. There is no meaningful unionization and no structured
 grievance system. All professional groups are organized into
 associations or federations, but these are basically creatures
 of the Communist Party; the groups' leadership is ordinarily
 drawn from Party ranks. While there is a state-controlled
 trade union movement and directives that provide for certain
 minimal work conditions, their application is whimsical. If
 the authorities attach a special priority to a task, workers
 can be driven without regard for minimum standards.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Traditionally, Laos has considered itself a Buddhist nation
 with only a few adherents to other religions. The Government
 has taken over some Buddhist and Christian places of worship
 for use as seminar halls or warehouses. Otherwise, the
 practice of Buddhism and Christianity has been allowed to
 continue relatively freely. The Government has begun a
 long-term effort to subvert the role of religion--in part
 because it considers the maintenance of temples and the
 activities of monks non-productive. It does this by carefully
 controlling the induction of young monks and by compelling the
 Buddhist clergy to propagate some aspects of Marxist-Leninist
 
 
 756
 doctrine. Monks are the only remaining social group still
 entitled to special honorifc terms of address. Religious
 festivals are permitted to take place without hindrance. Young
 people continue to engage in religious activities on a large
 scale, but entry into religious orders is not encouraged.
 d. Freedom of Movement within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Lao citizens are required to seek permission from the
 authorities for all internal travel of any distance and in all
 cases when crossing provincial boundaries. Permission for
 internal travel was tightened during the second half of 1982 in
 the wake of increased insurgent activity in the countryside. A
 curfew exists in the capital and other major cities. Its terms
 change from time to time, as does its enforcement. Government
 officials have cited threats of 'disorders' created by
 .reactionary' elements as the reason for the restrictions.
 Foreign travel is permitted for officials, students in
 government-approved programs, and the few who have foreign
 exchange. Border crossing permits are available for those with
 business in Thailand. Although the Lao Government has said
 that those wishing to emigrate will be allowed to do so, as a
 practical matter legal emigration is rarely authorized for
 ethnic Lao and reportedly involves substantial payments when it
 is. In fact, tens of thousands have fled Laos clandestinely.
 Since 1975, about 280,000 Lao have been registered as refugees
 in Thailand; it is likely that a significant further number
 have slipped into Thailand without registering.
 Some of those fleeing are fired upon and some killed by Lao,
 Vietnamese, or Thai border patrols as they attempt to cross the
 river. Many Lao caught seeking to leave illegally have been
 imprisoned although in some cases they have only been sent for
 short indoctrination seminars and then released. The Lao and
 Thai Governments have agreed to take back, on a case-by-case
 basis, those of its citizens who have illegally crossed into
 the other country and wish to return home. Since May 1980,
 when agreement was reached with Thailand and the United Nations
 High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) on a voluntary
 repatriation program, over 1,800 Lao refugees have voluntarily
 returned to Laos under the auspices of the UNHCR. Upon return,
 the homecomers receive several days of political indoctrination
 and are then released to return to their homes, where they are
 placed under control of village authorities. UNHCR provides
 basic necessities upon immediate return and monitors treatment
 and living conditions thereafter. There appears to be no
 pattern of official harassment or maltreatment of these
 voluntary returnees although reportedly a few of some 300 hill
 tribe refugees who were forcibly repatriated from Thailand in
 June 1982 were arrested.
 e. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 There is no freedom to participate in politics in Laos outside
 of the one government party. Local elections were held by the
 new authorities in the autumn of 1975 before the actual
 establishment of the present Government. Voters in villages
 and districts were allowed a choice from a list of candidates
 who had been pre-selected by the state/party organization.
 Provincial and national representatives were reportedly chosen
 by those locally elected officials, although the latter process
 was not made public. There have been no national elections
 held (or even discussed) since the Government was established
 in December 1975.
 
 
 757
 Approximately half of the population in Laos are ethnic Lao,
 also called *lowland Lao"; 20 percent are tribal Thai; and 15
 percent Phoutheung (or Kha); mountain tribes constitute another
 15 percent (Hmong, Yao and others). The Lao Government is
 attempting to overcome traditional antagonistic lowland Lao
 attitudes toward minority groups (and vice versa) and to
 integrate these groups into the Lao nation; this reportedly
 sometimes requires coercion such as forceable relocation of
 minorities.
 There is no evidence that the Government is seeking to destroy
 any entire ethnic group, per se, such as the Hmong (Meo). The
 Hmong themselves are split along clan lines. Many were
 strongly anti-communist, but others were on the side of the
 Government and the Vietnamese. The Government is repressive
 toward all groups that fought against its takeover and most
 especially toward those who continue to resist its authority by
 force of arms. The war with the Hmong resistance group has
 been brutal; but the main difference between the Hmong and
 other resistance groups is that the among have strong military
 traditions, and some have attempted to defend specific tribal
 areas. There is a traditional ethnic antipathy between the
 lowland peoples, like the Lao, and the highlanders, like the
 Hmong. Because the latter were heavily armed, the Vietnamese
 and local armed forces have conducted military operations to
 dislodge Hmong fighters from their strongholds.
 The Government would like to resettle some ethnic minorities
 who now inhabit mountainous areas in the lowlands, where they
 would be under better government control and where they could
 engage in settled agricultural production. Its sometimes
 insensitive approach to resettling Hmong in lowland areas has
 usually resulted in disease and hopelessness among those
 affected. Some tribal groups have been forcibly relocated.
 Refugees report that large numbers of women and children were
 killed in bombing raids and that captured Hmong soldiers were
 dealt with harshly and in some cases killed.
 Reports by among refugees of attacks, presumably by Lao or
 Vietnamese military forces with possible Soviet assistance,
 against the Hmong using lethal chemical agents continue. Since
 September 1981 new evidence in the form of organic samples has
 been found in Southeast Asia, lending weight to the charge that
 biological/chemical weapons have been used within Laos. (For
 further information, see the Secretary of State's reports to
 Congress on chemical warfare in Southeast Asia and Afghanistan
 of March 22 and November 16, 1982.) This charge has been
 denied by the Lao Government. International efforts continue
 to gather information, to express deep concern over these
 disturbing reports, and to seek an impartial international
 investigation. The United States has urged Laos to accede to
 the Geneva Protocol of 1925 on such weapons, but has received
 no response.
 There has also been an ongoing Government campaign to suppress
 resistance from lowland Lao groups, mainly in southern Laos,
 around Vientiane, and in northwest Laos. Many of the
 insurgents appear to be former Royal Army troops. Both sides
 are reported to use brutal tactics, with the anti-government
 terrorists attempting assassination and ambush of Lao,
 Vietnamese, and other military and civilian personnel.
 Deterioration in Sino-Lao relations has resulted in increasing
 Lao Government suspicion of and surveillance of local Chinese.
 So far, however, there has been no policy of deliberate
 
 
 758
 expulsion or persecution. The Chinese school in Vientiane
 remains open and Chinese associations maintain a low profile.
 Chinese merchants are still in business, although a majority of
 them have left the country, largely for economic reasons.
 Departures by this group continue. The Lao Government allows
 Chinese to emigrate rather freely.
 The role of women in Lao society has traditionally been
 subservient to that of men, but Lao women experience less
 discrimination than those in many other countries. They are
 currently being encouraged to take an increasing part in
 economic and state-controlled political activity.
 3. Government Attitude Regarding International and Non-
 governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations of
 Human Rights
 The Lao Government continues to refuse to cooperate with the UN
 and its committee of experts in their investigation of the use
 of chemical/biological weapons in Laos. It does not cooperate
 with private international organizations interested in human
 rights. Amnesty International's latest report, covering 1981,
 describes that organization's continuing concern about the
 "detention without trial of several thousand Laotions" detained
 after the present regime came to power. Amnesty did comment,
 however, that a 'significant number of detainees were released
 in 1981.'
 4. Economic, Social, and Cultural Situation
 About 85 percent of the population of Laos is engaged in
 subsistence agriculture. The per capita gross national product
 is estimated at under $100 and is disproportionately
 concentrated in a small number of cities. The country's
 economic problems are further complicated by inadequate
 internal transportation and isolation from the sea. The avowed
 aim of the Government is to improve the economic
 self-sufficiency of the country and the condition of the people
 by a( socialist transformation of the economy, including
 collectivization of agriculture. The Government has outlined
 an ambitious program of economic development with emphasis on
 agriculture and forestry. In early 1978, instances of
 attempted coercion of some farmers to join agricultural
 cooperatives were reported, causing for the first time some
 lowland Lao farmers to leave the country. According to the Lao
 Government, this coercion was the result of lack of
 understanding by both cadre and farmers and was not a
 government policy.
 The formation of new cooperatives has been slowed, and the
 Government has declared that membership in collectives will not
 be subject to coercion. The Government has nationalized most
 industries and has at times tried to impose strict controls on
 urban private enterprise. Private trade is allowed to
 continue, however, by virtue of the fact that it still
 constitutes the principal and most efficient manner for
 providing for the people's economic well-being. In 1982 there
 appears to have been some easing of constraints on small
 business.
 Laos continues to experience serious foreign exchange
 difficulties. Domestic difficulties, natural and man-made,
 continue to hold timber and coffee exports far below their
 potential. In addition, the Government has used these
 commodities and minerals to pay aid debts to Soviet bloc
 
 
 759
 countries, thus sacrificing desperately needed hard currency
 earnings. Laos has difficulties in paying its import bills for
 many necessities, including fuel.
 The health picture is discouragingly poor. Infant mortality is
 about 128.8 per 1000 live births. Life expectancy is
 approximately 42.6 years. Only two out of three children reach
 age four. The estimated overall population growth rate is 2.4
 percent. There are perhaps no more than 150 physicians in the
 country. Laos has only four hospitals of any significant
 size. Major causes of premature death in Laos are
 gastrointestinal diseases deriving from unsafe drinking water,
 malaria, respiratory infections, and malnutrition. The
 Government is attempting to improve the health situation by
 training more cadre in basic health care, improving water
 supplies, modernizing 13 provincial hospitals, constructing
 clinics in all districts, inoculating against cholera and other
 diseases, and promoting adult education on preventive hygiene.
 The Lao authorities are continuing a campaign to reduce
 illiteracy. Although official data claim a 60 percent adult
 literacy rate, this figure seems exaggerated. (The World Bank
 estimated a 41 percent literacy rate in 1977.) It is difficult
 to assess the success of this campaign although the Government
 has made sweeping claims that illiteracy has been eliminated in
 entire provinces. The Government carries out an intensive
 program of adult education with the primary aim of
 indoctrinating adults along 'socialist lines.' Approximately
 93 percent of children aged 5-14 are said to attend school
 regularly. The effectiveness of teachers is necessarily
 limited, however, since their own training has usually been
 only rudimentary. According to some accounts, in provincial
 areas the time teachers must devote to supplementing their
 meager incomes causes them to reduce classroom hours
 substantially.
 Emphasis on higher education is placed on training technicians
 and engineers to help meet the great need for such personnel in
 development projects. Thousands of Lao students have been sent
 abroad for training in the USSR, Vietnam, and Eastern Europe.
 The pool of trained manpower in Laos, however, continues to
 suffer losses as skilled workers flee the country as refugees.
