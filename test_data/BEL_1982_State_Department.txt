 BELGIUM
 Belgium is a parliamentary democracy under a constitutional
 monarch. Its Council of Ministers (cabinet) in practice is
 responsible for governmental decisions. The council, led by
 the Prime Minister, holds office as long as it retains the
 confidence of the Parliament. Direct popular elections for
 parliamentary seats (excluding 76 of the 182 Senate seats
 apportioned by other means) are held at least every four years
 under a system of universal suffrage, obligatory voting, and
 proportional representation. Belgium is a party to the 1950
 European Convention on the Protection of Human Rights and
 Fundamental Freedoms. Political freedoms and guarantees of
 individual rights are embodied in the constitution and laws,
 and are observed in practice. Educational levels are high, as
 is public involvement in the governmental process. The
 Government is committed to continue a policy of social benefits
 and equitable distribution of economic gains to its population.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Killing
 Neither the Belgian authorities nor officially-sanctioned
 groups engage in killings for political motives. Two Yugoslavs
 were shot to death in Brussels in March 1982, possibly by
 Croatian nationalists. A bomb blast in Antwerp's diamond
 district in October 1981 killed two, injured dozens, and caused
 extensive property damage. These were the only recent deaths in
 Belgium that could be described as terrorist-related.
 Terrorism in Belgium has to date been a generally low-level,
 externally-motivated activity. The most recent instance was
 the machine-gunning of a Brussels synagogue on September 18,
 1982, leaving four persons injured. No perpetrator has to date
 been found by the authorities.
 b. Disappearance
 Abductions, secret arrests, or clandestine detentions by
 official or quasi-official security forces, or by other
 officially-condoned elements, contravene Belgian law and are
 unknown in practice.
 c. Torture
 Freedom from torture is guaranteed by law and respected in
 practice. The Belgian Constitution provides that "no person
 may be prosecuted except in cases laid down by the law and in
 the form it prescribes" and "no penalty may be decreed nor
 applied save in accordance with the law". The Belgian Penal
 Code prohibits the deliberate mistreatment or injury of another
 and is applicable to the actions of officials, as well as
 those of private individuals.
 d. Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 Freedom from cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment is
 guaranteed by law and is respected in practice. There are
 
 
 848
 no differences in the conditions of confinement based on race,
 sex, religion, or social class. Persons convicted of
 non-violent crimes are, however, often assigned to minimum
 security facilities.
 e. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 Freedom from arbitrary arrest and imprisonment is guaranteed by
 law and respected in practice. Arrested persons must be
 brought before a judge within 24 hours or released. Belgian
 law provides for pre-trial confinement only under special
 circumstances: when a person is apprehended in the commission
 of a criminal act; when there is a risk that the suspect will
 prove a danger to the community; when there is a risk that he
 will flee the jurisdiction; and in cases involving a number of
 serious offenses specified by law. The justification for such
 confinement is subject to periodic review by a panel of judges.
 f. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 A fair public trial, including the right to counsel, is
 guaranteed by law and honored in practice. A suspect is
 charged, if the evidence so warrants, when the preliminary
 judicial-Investigatory phase is completed. Charges are clearly
 andformally stated. A civilian may not be tried within
 Belgium by military- courts; however, civilian dependents
 accompanying Belgian forces stationed outside the country are
 subject to the code of military justice and can be tried by
 military courts.
 g. Invasion of the Home
 Freedom from invasion of the home is guaranteed by law and
 respected in practice. The inviolability of the home is
 specifically guaranteed by the Belgian Constitution, except in
 cases laid down and regulated by law. The law forbids searches
 of private homes at night except in special circumstances;
 warrants issued by a judge are required unless the inhabitants
 of the domicile agree to the search. The penal code provides
 penalties for all violations of the home by officials as well
 as by private persons.
 2. Respect for Civil and Political Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 These freedoms are guaranteed by law and respected in
 practice. Varying political, religious, philosophical, and
 artistic views are permitted free public expression, and there
 is no political censorship of the media. There are, however,
 prohibitions on publications and productions held to undermine
 "-public order" (e.g. pornography and incitement of violence).
 There-are laws against libel, provisions for a citizen's right
 of reply-to media criticism, and-restrictions on criticism of
 government policies by civil servants. Belgium has a
 stateowned radio and television network, but there is no
 direct government control of program content. Programs are
 supervised by boards of directors which represent the main
 currents of opinion. The Government has a representative on
 the boards but no veto power.
 
 
 849
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Subject to regulations of public order, political, civic,
 religious, artistic, social, and special interest groups are
 permitted free public assembly. Labor unions and professional
 groups are free from harassment and persecution.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 The Christian, Jewish, and Moslem religions are accorded a
 "recognized" status in law which entails a government subsidy.
 Minority "non-recognized" religions enjoy full freedom to
 practice and are not subject to harassment or persecution.
 d. Freedom of Movement within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 These freedoms are guaranteed by law and respected in
 practice. Belgian citizens enjoy freedom of travel within the
 country and internationally, including the right of voluntary
 repatriation. Within a system of immigration and labor
 regulations, Belgium previously admitted a large number of
 foreign immigrants. The granting of resident status to
 non-European community nationals has become more restrictive in
 recent years due to domestic unemployment. As a general
 practice, Belgium grants the right of political asylum to those
 foreign nationals applying in Belgium who are recommended by
 the local office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees as
 eligible for asylum.
 e. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Participation in the political system is open to all citizens.
 Suffrage is universal for all adults (18 or over), secret, and
 compulsory. Unweighted voting (one person/one vote) has been
 in effect since 1919, and women's suffrage since 1948. Women
 are legally equal to men in virtually all respects and
 participate freely in political, as well as social and economic
 life; the number active in these areas is growing. In mid-1982
 women had 11 out of 212 House seats and 21 out of 182 Senate
 seats in Parliament, as well as 4 of the 9 State Secretary
 (subministerial) portfolios. There are 13 parties currently
 represented in the Belgian Parliament. Opposition parties are
 free under law and in practice to operate without constraints
 or repression.
 Labor unions in Belgium are organized along lines parallel to
 political parties. Therefore, it is partly through the
 political parties that the Belgian Socialist, Catholic, and
 Liberal trade union federations influence the political
 process. Since approximately 80 percent of the labor force is
 affiliated to one or another of the labor unions, the unions
 are a significant force in society, the polity in general, and
 in the economy in particular.
 3. Government Attitude Regarding International and Non-
 governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations of
 Human Rights
 The Belgian Government has been active in promoting
 independent investigation of alleged human rights violations.
 No requests have been made for outside investigation of the
 human rights situation in Belgium.

 4. Economic, Social, and Cultural Situation
 Belgium is an affluent country. Its per capita gross national
 product in 1982 was about $9,370. The Government is committed
 to policies ensuring that these benefits are distributed
 equitably throughout the economy. The adverse effects of a
 general downturn in the world economy, combined with structural
 problems in the national economy, have led to a high
 unemployment rate. This is being confronted by remedial
 governmental policies and by an extensive system of
 unemployment compensation and other social benefits. In most
 cases, these have prevented serious individual hardship.
 A common public educational system serves all economic levels.
 Women in Belgium hold many positions of distinction, power, and
 importance in areas such as politics, business, science,
 medicine, and the arts. As a rule, however, women occupy
 lower-paying positions. Foreign workers, both male and female,
 who usually perform menial functions, generally earn the lowest
 wages and fill the socially less desirable jobs. Belgium has
 provided the basic legal guarantees and the benefits of its
 extensive social security system to most foreign workers.
 To confront the longstanding problem of linguistic division
 between the Dutch-speaking north and the French-speaking south,
 detailed provisions have been made in law and government
 structure to assure.equitable participation in the national
 life for both major linguistic groups. A long-term solution to
 the linguistic community problems remains a priority goal of
 the government, and new legislation to this end was enacted in
 1980. Implementation legislation is expected in 1983.
 Belgium's population enjoys a life expectancy at birth of 72.9
 years. The infant mortality rate is 11 per 1,000 live births
 (1981). Its population is growing at the rate of 0.2 percent
 per-year  (1980). The population is almost totally literate,
 and the adjusted-primaxy school enrollment rate for both sexes
 is 100 percent.
