 MEXICO
 Mexico is a federal republic which has been governed by the
 Institutional Revolutionary Party [PRI] since 1929. The
 Constitution of 1917 provides for the separation of powers
 among a bicameral legislature, a judiciary, and an executive,
 but the powers of the Presidency far outweigh those of the
 other branches in Mexico's highly centralized system.
 The PHI dominates politics at the federal, state, and local
 levels but opposition parties are both allowed and encouraged
 by the Government as outlets for criticism and dissatisfaction.
 They have not, however, been able successfully to challenge the
 PHI politically in presidential or gubernatorial elections and
 some observers note that Mexico remains virtually a one party
 state. Opposition party opportunities have been thwarted by
 nationwide PHI voting strength and organizational power, by the
 party's maneuvers to co-opt and/or divide the opposition, and,
 the opposition claims, by electoral fraud. In 1983, the
 National Action Party [PAN], a center-right opposition party,
 won unprecedented municipal electoral victories in thestates
 of Chihuahua and Durango which were interpreted by some Mexican
 political observers as an indication that the new admin-
 istration elected in 1982 is prepared to allow a greater degree
 of political pluralism.
 Following widespread corruption under previous administrations,
 one of the first acts of President de la Madrid and his
 Administration, after taking office on December 1, 1982, was to
 promulgate legislation governing the conduct of public
 officials and prohibiting such practices as nepotism. The
 Attorney General has initiated investigations into the finances
 of a number of state-run enterprises under the previous
 Administration, and certain former officials are currently
 being prosecuted for fraud. The new Administration has also
 given priority to agrarian reform, as disputes over tenure and
 the maldistribution of land in the rural sector have led to
 confrontations between the peasants and landowners and
 complaints about corruption.
 Human rights organizations, such as Amnesty International and
 the National Committee in Defense of Prisoners, Persecuted,
 Disappeared, and Political Exiles in Mexico [the National
 Defense Committee], have charged that approximately 500
 political dissidents who had *disappeared' over the years were
 being held clandestinely in government prisons. The Government
 has denied such charges.
 During 1983, at least one elected municipal leader and several
 political activists from parties opposed to the Government were
 killed in incidents in Chiapas, Puebla, and Guerrero. The
 opposition parties have blamed the PRI for the killings, while
 others accuse corrupt local officials of being responsible.
 The perpetrators have yet to be brought to justice.
 Overall, Mexico continued to improve its human rights record in
 1983. Although there continued to be some allegations of
 misuse of police authority, the Government has sought to curb
 such abuses as part of its general anti-corruption campaign.
 Internal security forces guilty of such abuses have been
 disciplined and, in some cases, disbanded. The trend of
 Mexican compliance with generally-accepted standards of respect
 for human rights is positive.

 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS.
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom From:
 a. Unlawful or Arbitrary Deprivation of Life
 Peasant organizations charged that during 1983 at least 17
 persons were killed in the state of Chiapas. They claim that
 corrupt local leaders were responsible and, in some cases, were
 assisted by local police and PRI leaders. There have been
 subsequent official investigations into the killings, but no
 results have been reported.
 Peasants united in a number of instances during 1983 to oppose
 local leaders and demand improved working conditions. The
 peasant organizations have criticized the government for not
 controlling the local leaders or eliminating the abuses of
 power by politicians and the police. The.new Administration
 has given high priority to agrarian reform and the elimination
 of corruption in the rural sector. In addition, Amnesty
 International's 1993 report included allegations of other
 killings by the security forces.
 b. Disappearance
 The National Defense Committee, led by Mrs. Rosario Ibarra de
 Piedra, Mexico's most prominent human rights advocate and a
 1982 presidential candidate for the left wing Revolutionary
 Workers Party [PRT], continues to express concern about the
 fate of missing persons allegedly held by the Government. The
 Committee states that 510 persons have disappeared from the
 late 1960's to the present--most during previous
 Administrations--and claims that they are being held
 clandestinely in a chain of government controlled underground
 prisons. It supports these claims with reports by other human
 rights groups, news reports, and letters smuggled out of
 prison. The Committee notes that only seven persons have
 disappeared since the current Administration took office in
 1982, and that four of these were abducted by the police.
 The Federal District Attorney General has promised to
 investigate these cases, but so far, the Committee states, the
 Government has provided it no information. There have been
 press reports in Mexico in 1983 of the disappearance of at
 least four peasants involved in land disputes in Chiapas.
 Amnesty International in its 1983 report expressed concern
 about a number of persons who had disappeared in 1982 and
 previously.
 The Government has denied involvement in the disappearance of
 individuals and there is no reliable evidence to the contrary.
 The Government states that those unaccounted for were killed in
 encounters with security forces, changed their names, went
 underground, or voluntarily went into exile.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Although torture is prohibited by the Constitution, human
 rights organizations have charged that the police have tortured
 political prisoners with electric shocks, beatings, submersion
 in water, deprivation of light and food, and the forcing of
 chili-laden mineral water up the nostrils. The National
 
 
 626
 Defense Committee has reported that the victims of such
 treatment in 1983 were afraid to sign statements testifying to
 abusive practices while in police custody because of fear of
 reprisal. The press and the 1983 Amnesty International report
 also mentioned that confessions had been extracted by the use
 of torture and that bodies had appeared bearing the marks of
 torture. Although there is little evidence available to support
 these claims, it is believed by some sources that the police do
 at times resort to torture.
 Since the current Administration took office, reforms have been
 carried out in the prisons of the Federal District, including
 doubling the daily budget for food per prisoner and developing
 prison industries to sell products on the open market.
 Training prisoners in a marketable skill has also been
 instituted. There is chronic overcrowding of prisons outside
 the Federal District, sometimes to more than double the
 intended population. Public complaints also focus on lack of
 trained personnel, corruption among prison staff members, and
 mistreatment of prisoners.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Critics of the Government claim that the police frequently make
 arbitrary arrests, especially of peasant activists. Peasant
 organizations have claimed that in April 1983 a number of women
 in a village in Chiapas were arbitrarily arrested and held in
 jail for 24 hours by members of the state public security
 forces. They have also alleged that nine arbitrary arrests
 occurred in June 1983 in Chiapas. They also said that in
 September 1983 in Toluca, a peasant leader, Maria de Lourdes
 Munoz de Medina, was held in direct contravention of a court
 order prohibiting her arrest. An opposition party claimed that
 the municipal police in Ciudad Juarez in July 1983 committed a
 number of unconstitutional arrests on the pretext of preventing
 criminal acts.
 Notwithstanding the Constitutional guarantee that formal
 charges must be made within 72 hours after a person is
 detained, authorities have reportedly held individuals longer,
 claiming that the 72 hours begins only when the prisoner
 appears before a judge. Critics note that, in the state of
 Toluca, two peasants were held for five days without charge;
 during the first two days, they were held by the public
 prosecutor before being passed to the judge. Newspaper
 articles claimed that the Judicial Police of the Federal
 District held people for more than 15 days without informing
 the Attorney General's office in order to extract money from
 the families of those who were held. The National Defense
 Committee claimed that 13 political prisoners were still held
 in jail even though they should have been released under the
 amnesty law, passed under the previous Administration in 1979.
 In January 1983, President de la Madrid ordered the disbanding
 of a secret police unit, the Office of Investigations to
 Prevent Delinquency, and the incorporation of its members into
 the Judicial Police of the Federal District. The Office was
 accused of being responsible for such illegal and corrupt
 practices as making arbitrary arrests and running clandestine
 prisons.
 No Mexicans are known to have gone into political exile in
 1983. Press articles indicate that three Mexicans returned
 
 
 627
 from 11 years of exile in Cuba in February 1983 under the law
 of amnesty.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Under the Constitution, trial and sentencing must be completed
 within 12 months of arrest for crimes that would carry at least
 a two-year sentence. Nevertheless, trial delays are often
 caused by cumbersome court procedures, and by the defendants
 inability or unwillingness to pay illegal bribes in the form of
 "gratuities' to bring the cases to trial. Defendants have a
 right to counsel and public defenders are available. Although
 certain sections of the Criminal Code provide for the convoking
 of tribunals with juries, in practice this almost never takes
 place. In these and other cases, a judge generally acting
 alone examines written statements, expert opinion, and less
 commonly, oral testimony and then makes his decision. There
 are periodic allegations in the Mexican press of confessions
 obtained through coercion.
 It is not possible to determine whether there are any political
 prisoners in Mexico. The Government maintains that there are
 no political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Although the Mexican Government generally does not intrude on
 privacy of individuals and search warrants are required by law,
 it has been accused by opposition leaders of monitoring their
 activities. Mexican human rights activists have alleged that
 they are followed by the police and that their telephone lines
 are tapped. During 1983, there were allegations of invasions
 of peasants' homes by local leaders, accompanied by police,
 without warrant. There were also charges that these incidents
 were often accompanied by robbery, rape, and sometimes the
 burning of homes. In September 1983 more than 1,000 dwellings
 which peasants had built on land belonging to landowners were
 confiscated by the landowners, then seized again by the
 peasants, and finally destroyed by Jalisco state authorities.
 Government sources were reported by the press as saying that
 the peasants were manipulated by peasant leaders to invade
 private land and that the homes were squatters' cardboard
 shacks. Peasant organizations and press reports also claim
 that the entire village of Tzacacum in Chiapas was burned by
 state authorities in June 1983, and they cite similiar
 occurrences that allegedly took place in La Graja, Llano Grande
 and Ejido Arosto in Chiapas.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Freedom of speech and of the press are guaranteed by law. The
 Government tolerates public criticism by opposition parties and
 the press. Certain topics, such as direct criticism of the
 President have traditionally been shunned by most media. Overt
 censorship is exercised mostly on moral grounds, be it in
 print, radio, movies or television. Nevertheless, press
 sources report that-previous Governments influenced the press
 by giving financial supplements to individual reporters for
 favorable articles, by withholding newsprint [a government
 monopoly] from critical papers, and by selectively placing
 government advertising, an important source of income for the
 
 
 628
 press. Some journalists have claimed that President de'la
 Madrid's Administration has abandoned these measures, but other
 press sources have said that financial supplements to
 journalists have been resumed and that other methods of
 influence are still being used.
 President de la Madrid's Administration has reinstated a
 popular radio program, Opinion Publica, that was broadcast by a
 private station and was taken off the air by the previous
 Government for broadcasting critical views. Although the
 program has been revived, opposition observers have noted that
 the live telephone call-in format was abandoned in favor of
 recorded calls. This, they claim, is for the purpose of
 censorship by the Government. However, the outspoken moderator
 of the program remains the same.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Constitution grants the right to peaceful assembly for any
 lawful purpose, and the Government has allowed demonstrations
 by critical groups to take place throughout the country.
 Government authorization is generally required for major
 demonstrations, however. In Oaxaca, an alliance of leftist
 forces supported by the local Unified Socialist Party held the
 mayorship since 1981. On the eve of state elections in July
 1983, violence broke out between the PRI and the Unified
 Socialists during a political rally. Deaths and injuries
 resulted and the state legislature stripped the local
 administration of its authority and postponed the local
 elections. The Unified Socialists claimed that the PRI had
 instigated the violence, with disenfranchisement as its
 intent. A leading Mexican daily newspaper reported that that
 one of its journalists had been warned by a PRI supporter the
 day before the violence broke out that there would be
 bloodshed. The PRI attributes the origin of the violence to
 agitators. Subsequent to these events, municipal and state
 council elections were held in Oaxaca and the PRI won most
 contests.
 In July 1983, a demonstration by students and teachers in
 Mexico City, which the Government had not authorized, was
 forcibly broken up by police. The Mexican Red Cross reported
 70 injured. The Government justified the suppression of the
 demonstration on the grounds that it was disrupting Mexico
 City's two main thoroughfares and that demonstration leaders
 had not obtained the required official authorization.
 Trade unions enjoy and practice the right to organize,
 negotiate, and strike. About 85 percent of urban workers are
 organized, mostly under the Confederation of Mexican Workers
 (CTM) which is affiliated with the PRI. The confederation both
 influences and is influenced by the government. Several
 powerful independent unions also exist. Mexican trade unions
 enjoy close ties with major American and international labor
 organizations.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Mexico is predominantly Roman Catholic. The law protects
 freedom of religion, but according to the terms of the
 Constitution no religious body has any legal existence. The
 clergy is prohibited from participating in politics, voting,
 owning real estate, and wearing religious habits in public.
 Most of these prohibitions are not strictly enforced. Neither
 
 
 629
 is a constitutional restriction against pre-university
 parochial schools, many of which exist.
 In 1983, the PRI and opposition parties of the left reacted
 strongly against statements by the Church hierarchy concerning
 political issues. Evangelical groups have been accused by the
 Government, the Catholic Church, and the press of seeking to
 divide Indian communities and sowing conflict among them. In
 April 1983, press articles reported that more than 600 families
 which adhered to evangelical beliefs had been expelled by the
 rest of an Indian community in Chiapas. The families left
 their homes, possessions, and land and were forced to live in
 extreme poverty on the outskirts of the community. The
 evangelist preachers were also obliged to leave. Similar
 occurrences were alleged to have taken place in six other
 Indian communities in Chiapas.
 d. Freedom of Movement within the Country, Foreign Travel,
 Emigration, and Repatriation
 Freedom of movement within and outside the country is
 unrestricted.
 Mexico has traditionally followed a liberal asylum policy and
 has opened its borders to Central Americans fleeing from their
 countries. The Government has accepted large numbers of
 displaced Guatemalans who have been temporarily settled near
 the border. In early 1983, about 10 Guatemalan refugees were
 abducted by unidentified raiders from Guatemala. The
 Government protested these incursions. The presence of
 Guatemalan refugees in Mexico was estimated officially at over
 35,000 in June 1983. Government spokesmen have stated that the
 Government does not plan to encourage the refugees to leave
 Mexico at the present time. The Government has refused to give
 estimates of the number of Salvadorans present in Mexico and
 does not regard them as refugees. The U.N. High Commissioner
 for Refugees estimated that 15,000 Salvadorans were present in
 Mexico in late 1983. The number of Salvadoran political
 asylees in Mexico has been estimated at less than 100.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to
 Change Their Government
 Mexico has been governed for almost fifty years by the PRI, the
 dominant party. To secure its continuity in power, the PHI has
 relied on revolutionary legitimacy, cooptation of the
 opposition, massive government and PRI organizational resources
 and--opponents charge--on electoral fraud in some cases. The
 PRI has broad representation from labor, peasants, and other
 sectors of society. Minority groups, including women and
 Indians, are allowed full participation in the Mexican
 political process. Election reform laws in 1977 legalized the
 formation of opposition parties and earmarked seats in state
 and federal legislatures for them. Under the law, all citizens
 aged 18 and over may vote. Only members of the clergy, under
 the Constitution, are denied this right. President de la
 Madrid, in his first State of the Union message, emphasized his
 commitment to political pluralism in Mexico. Municipal
 election victories by opposition parties in the states of
 Chihuahua and Durango in July 1983 apparently reflected greater
 government tolerance of dissenting views. However, when
 opposition parties failed to secure victories in subsequent
 elections for the governorship and municipal offices
 
 
 630
 in Baja California Norte and in Sinaloa, there were allegations
 that the PHI had carried out electoral fraud. There is
 conflicting evidence over these claims, but some Mexican
 political observers have pointed to the massive electoral
 campaign mounted by the PRI in Baja California Norte, following
 its defeats in Chihuahua and Durango, as the reason for the PRI
 victories in that state.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government participates in international human rights
 forums and allows both domestic and international human rights
 groups to operate in Mexico without restrictions or harassment.
 Amnesty International has an office in Mexico. Mexican human
 rights organizations have numerous contacts with other Latin
 American human rights groups. The National Defense Committee
 claims to have been instrumental in obtaining the release of a
 significant number of disappeared persons since 1979. Mexican
 human rights advocates have access to senior government
 officials.
 Amnesty International in its 1983 report, which covered
 calendar year 1982, noted that there were abuses such as
 prolonged detentions incommunicado, convictions based on
 confessions reportedly extracted under torture, disappearances
 of political detainees, and reported killings by both regular
 police and security units and paramilitary units linked to
 them. It added that many of the victims were urban slum
 dwellers or peasants involved in land disputes. Amnesty
 International also expressed concern about deaths from torture
 of persons in custody and the killings or disappearance of
 persons shortly after their release from prison. Freedom House
 in 1983 rated Mexico 'partly free.'
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 Mexico's major domestic economic and social problems are
 poverty, inflation, declining real income, a declining level of
 economic activity, unemployment, severely uneven income
 distribution, and a high rate of population growth.
 These problems led the the new de la Madrid administration to
 begin a wide-ranging program to reduce inflation and increase
 foreign exchange reserves without unduly reducing employment
 levels in the short term. The longer term objective is to
 promote a sustainable rate of growth that will reduce
 unemployment and, hence, poverty. The Government maintains its
 right to regulate many private economic activities in the
 public interest. Restrictions regarding the ownership of
 property by foreigners generally limit foreign equity
 participation to 49 percent.
 Mexico's population in 1983 was estimated at 76 million. Its
 population growth rate fell to 2.6 percent in 1983. Life
 expectancy at birth was 65.44 years in 1980. The infant
 mortality rate declined to 46.20 per 1,000 live births in
 1983. Mexico has become an urbanized society, with 60 percent
 of the population living in cities. Over 17 million people
 live in Mexico City.
 
 
 631
 The adjusted primary school enrollment ratio in Mexico was 124
 percent in 1979 (male 127 and female 122). Primary education
 is both free and obligatory and has been extended to include 10
 years of schooling. Adult literacy as of 1980 stood at 81
 percent. The Gross National Product per capita was $2,936.90
 in 1981. AS of 1975, 62 percent of the population had access
 to safe water (urban 70 percent and rural 49 percent).
 Inflation and unemployment continue to trouble the economy.
 Real income, particularly of government workers, has declined
 significantly as salary increases have fallen behind
 inflation. President de la Madrid stated that unemployment
 rose to eight percent during 1982. Underemployment has been
 estimated by many observers at 30 to 40 percent for several
 years.
 Men and women are equal in principle under the law. Mexican
 women have the right to file for divorce and separation. There
 are no travel restrictions on women and they can own property
 in their own names. Over the past ten years, women have
 increased their presence in nontraditional occupations.
 However, the concept of women as mothers and homemakers
 continues to dominate.
 The number of women's action groups is increasing and it
 appears that the objectives of women are becoming more
 diversified. Women comprise approximately 20 percent of the
 work force in urban areas but continue to work predominantly in
 nonsupervisory jobs with few at the executive level. However,
 of the 64 senators elected to the 52nd Legislature, six are
 women; of the 400 federal deputies, 35 are women.
