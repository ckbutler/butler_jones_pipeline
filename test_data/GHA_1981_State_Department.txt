 GHANA
 Since September 1979 Ghana had functioned under a democratic
 constitution which enumerated and provided means for protec-
 tion of fundamental human rights. Ghana was governed by a
 president, Hills Limann, elected in a runoff and a parliament
 elected from among candidates of six different parties. The
 courts, the electoral commissioner, the ombudsman, the
 council of state, the press and other institutions indepen-
 dent of both the executive and parliament helped to preserve
 individual rights and to prevent abuse of power. Individual
 and political rights were generally well respected in Ghana,
 without discrimination. However, some 30 persons convicted
 of various offenses in 1979 by the preceeding military
 government, the Armed Forces Revolutionary Council (AFRC),
 headed by former Plight Lieutenant Jerry J. Rawlings, remain
 in prison after "trials" and "convictions" without due
 process of law. The AFRC insisted, as a condition of
 turning over power, on transitional provisions in the
 constitution which confirmed the acts of the AFRC and which
 thus make redress of these apparent injustices extremely
 difficult. The Ghanaian economy, though potentially prosper-
 ous, has been deteriorating for years. Poverty is widespread.
 On December 31 1981, Rawlings, who had headed the APRC from
 June to September 1979, launched a coup against the Limann
 administration. On January 2, 1982, Rawlings announced
 suspension of the constitution; dismissal of the president,
 vice president and ministers; dissolution of parliament;
 abolition of the council of state and proscription of all
 political parties.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a.   Torture
 The now suspended constitution prohibited torture, and there
 were been no allegations of torture during 1981.
 b.   Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 The suspended constitution specifically prohibited cruel,
 inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, "or any other
 condition that detracts.. .from a person's dignity and worth
 as a human being." There were no allegations of such
 treatment during 1981, nor were any death sentences or other
 unduly harsh punishments imposed. Prison conditions
 are crowded and poor. There was no reported discrimination
 in prison conditions on the basis of ethnic origin, religion
 or sex.
 c. Disappearances
 There is no evidence that people in Ghana were abducted,
 secretly arrested or held in clandestine detention by
 officials of the government, in 1981.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 There are about 30 AFRC convicts still in prison after the
 1979 "trials" and "convictions" without due process. The
 transitional provisions of the now suspended 1979 constitution
 (108),
 
 89-510 0 - 82 - 8
 
 
 104
 which prevented review of their cases were challenged in the
 courts; the supreme court in November 1981 ruled that
 the constitution barred it from reversing decisions of AFRC
 courts. As a result, the government ordered the rearrest of
 former AFRC convicts freed by lower courts.
 The suspended constitution permited, during a state of
 emergency declared by the president with parliamentary
 approval, the application of measures authorized by law in
 derogation of individual rights, to the extent "reasonably
 justifiable for the purposes of dealing with the situation
 that exists during that period.* The Preventive Detention
 Act of 1965 permits detention of a person during such an
 emergency, but the constitution required that any such
 person must be told within 24 hours why he ks being detained
 or restricted and have his case reviewed by a tribunal
 within ten days and at three-month intervals thereafter.
 During 1981 no state of emergency was declared, and no one
 was placed under protective detention. The right of habeas
 corpus existed and was enforced by the high court of justice.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The suspended constitution provided that whenever a person
 is charged with a criminal offense he shall be afforded a
 fair hearing within a reasonable time by a court, and
 permitted to defend himself before the court in person or by
 counsel of his own choice. The constitution also required
 that a person who is arrested must immediately be informed
 of the charges against him and of his rights to counsel of
 his choice, and charged before a court within 24 hours.
 These provisions were generally respected. The judiciary was
 independent of the executive and legislature. There are no
 special political or security courts, except that the AFRC
 special tribunal continues in existence to complete the
 trial of cases begun in 1979. Military courts-martial may
 be established by parliament for the trial of offenses
 against military law by persons subject to that law; no
 civilians were tried by such courts in 1901. Courts-martial
 must follow the same procedure as civilian courts, except
 that in the case of offenses punishable by death or life
 imprisonment the verdict need not be unanimous. A defendant
 may appeal an adverse finding to the court of appeal from
 the high court of justice, except that AFRC convicts may
 appeal adverse findings of the special tribunal only to the
 tribunal itself.
 f. Invasion of the Home
 The suspended constitution provided that no person shall be
 subjected to the search of his person or his property nor
 shall his property or premises be entered into or intruded
 upon by others, except through due process of law. Warrants
 were issued by magistrates and judges acting as agents
 of courts of law. The government respected this provision.
 2.   Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a.. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 The suspended constitution protected freedom of conscience,
 including freedom of thought and religion, permited religious
 instruction but prevented its imposition on non-adherents,and
 
 
 105
 forbad the "adoption of any religion as the religion of
 the Republic of Ghana." The constitution prohibited reli-
 gious discrimination.
 The press exhibited great diversity and freedom. The
 constitution forbad censorship or hindrance in the enjoyment
 of freedom of expression. State-owned media were required
 to afford equal opportunities and facilities for the represen-
 tation of opposing or differing views. The constitution
 established an impartial and independent press commission
 which protected the media from government interference.
 The suspended constitution protected freedom of assembly,
 including peaceful processions, demonstrations and associa-
 tion, (including the right to form or join trade unions or
 other associations). The Trade Union Congress and its 17
 constituent unions are a powerful force in the economy and
 politics. The government had respected these provisions of
 law, which were enforceable by the high court of justice.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration and Repatriation
 The suspended constitution protected freedom of movement,
 including the right to move freely throughout Ghana, to
 reside anywhere in Ghana and to leave and enter Ghana. This
 provision was generally respected, but some Ghanaians found
 it difficult to get passports because of high fees, or to
 leave Ghana because of foreign exchange shortages.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 The suspended constitution permited Ghanaian citizens not
 less than 18 years old to vote, established an independent,
 impartial electoral commissioner to conduct elections, and
 permited the establishment of political parties which must
 be internally democratic and non-discriminatory in their
 aims. The 1979 political parties decree forbad the reestablish-
 ment of parties which had previously existed. Parliament
 was forbidden to enact a law establishing a one-party state,
 and any activity which suppressed or sought to suppress the
 lawful political activity of any other person or persons
 generally was unlawful. This prohibition was enforceable by
 the supreme court. Until the December 31, 1981 coup Ghana
 was governed by a president elected in a runoff election in
 1979 for a term to end in 1983, and by a parliament in which
 five parties were represented.
 In mid-1981, fighting between Nanumbas and Konkombas limited
 the exercise of rights in the eastern part of the northern
 region. These disturbances ended when police reinforcements
 and army units were deployed in the area. Apart from this,
 no insurgency or serious civil disorder was reported.
 Ghana's relations with its neighbors are peaceful and
 cooperative.
 3.     Government Attitude and Record Regarding Inter-
 national and Non-governmental Investigation of
 Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 As far as is known, Ghana cooperates whenever there is such
 an inquiry. Ghana also participates in the United Nations
 Human Rights Commission and chairs a subcommittee investigat-
 ing disappeared persons. Within Ghana, the Ghana Bar
 Association, the Ghana Assembly of Women and the United
 Nations Student Association are among organizations which
 observe, report and contest human rights violations. There
 is a "national amnesty" group seeking justice for APRC
 convicts.

 4.     Economic and Social Circumstances
 Ghana has an abundance of natural and human resources, but
 its economy has been deteriorating for a number of years.
 The economy is faced with a complex set of formidable'
 problems: negative growth; stagnant or declining production
 of food, cocoa (the most important cash crop), minerals,
 timber and industrial goods; a very low rate of capital
 formation; shortages of commodities, industrial raw materials
 and spare parts; an inflation rate of over 100 percent;
 rising budget expenditures and deficits; an overstaffed and
 inefficient public sector; a deteriorating transportation
 network; a grossly overvalued foreign exchange rate (in
 October 1981 the black market rate was about 15 times the
 official exchange rate), resulting in illegal economic
 activitieg; declining cocoa export earnings; a rising oil
 import bill; and a shortage of foreign exchange.
 Since 1975 per capita income has declined by approximately
 30.percent. Ghana's per capita GNP was about $400 in 1979.
 According to the IBRD, Ghana has slipped economically in
 comparison to other developing countries in recent years and
 now ranks near the bottom of the middle-income countries.
 The average Ghanaian has experienced a sharp drop in his
 standard of living since 1975. This is reflected in a
 declining percentage (most recent estimate is 86 percent) of
 calorie supply available for consumption relative to
 nutritional requirements. Furthermore, the population
 growth rate has been increasing; it is now at least three
 percent annually. On the other hand, there has been improve-
 ment in some of the social indicators: life expectancy at
 birth was 49 in 1979, compared to 41.5 years in 1968; and
 primary school enrollment has increased.
 Unfortunately, Ghanaian Goverments have neglected (or even
 discriminated against) rural areas, including the all-impor-
 tant cocoa sector, and have catered to the needs and demands
 of urban consumers.
 Because of the scarcity of goods, services and foreign
 exchange, those Ghanaians who have access to price-
 controlled goods, cheap import'licenses and/or foreign
 exchange benefit very substantially. They are able to
 sell imported goods at very high "free market" prices
 and obtain "fees" for services rendered.
 The privileged who have access to power and influence reap
 tangible benefits because of the positions they hold.
 The Limann Government had attempted without much success to
 cope with the country's severe economic problems. The crash
 agricultural program announced more than one year ago
 made little progress. A five-year development plan remains
 to be implemented. Discussions with the International
 Monetary Fund about necessary economic reforms have been
 continuing for more than one year, but so far no agreement
 has been reached. The government recently announced that
 cocoa farmers will receive a three-fold increase in the
 price of their produce. Other economic policy steps are
 needed to reduce the government deficit and to make the
 exchange rate more realistic so that increased exports and
 production can be stimulated.
