 WESTERN SAHARA
 The sovereignty of the Western Sahara remains the subject of a dispute between
 the Government of Morocco and the Polisario Front, an organization seeking inde-
 pendence for the region. The Moroccan Government sent troops and settlers into the
 northern two-thirds of the Western Sahara after Spain withdrew from the area in
 1975, and extended its administration over the southern province of Oued Ed Dahab
 after Mauritania renounced its claim in 1979. The Moroccan Government has under-
 taken a sizable economic development program in the Western Sahara as part of
 its long-term efforts to strengthen Moroccan claims to the territory.
 Since 1973 the Polisario Front has challenged the claims of Spain, Mauritania,
 and Morocco to the territory. Moroccan and Polisario forces fought intermittently
 from 1975 until the 1991 ceasefire and deployment to the area of a United Nations
 (U.N.) peacekeeping contingent, known by its French initials, MINURSO.
 In 1975 the International Court of Justice issued an advisory opinion on the sta-
 tus of the Western Sahara. The Court held that while some of the region's tribes
 had historical ties to Morocco, the ties were insufficient to establish "any tie of terri-
 torial sovereignty" between the Western Sahara and the Kingdom of Morocco. The
 Court added that it had not found "legal ties" that would trigger the applicable U.N.
 General Assembly Resolution regarding the decolonization of the territory, and, in
 particular, the principle of self-determination for its people. Most Sahrawis (as most
 persons living in the territory are called) live in the area controlled by Morocco, but
 there is a sizable refugee population near the border with Morocco, in Algeria, and,
 to a lesser extent, in Mauritania. The bulk of the Sahrawi population lives within
 the area delineated by a Moroccan-constructed berm, which encloses most of the ter-
 ritory.
 Efforts by the Organization of African Unity (OAU) to resolve the sovereignty
 question collapsed in 1984 when the OAU recognized the Saharan Arab Democratic
 Republic, the civilian arm of the Polisario Front. Morocco withdrew from the OAU
 in protest.
 In 1988 Morocco and the Polisario Front accepted the U.N. plan for a referendum
 that would allow the Sahrawis to decide between integration with Morocco or inde-
 pendence for the territory. The referendum was scheduled for January 1992, but
 was postponed because the parties were unable to agree on a common list of eligible
 voters-despite the previous acceptance by both parties of an updated version of the
 Spanish census of 1974 as the base for voter eligibility. A complicated formula for
 determining voter eligibility was ultimately devised, and in August 1994, MINURSO
 personnel began to hold identification sessions for voter applicants.
 The voter identification process ended in December 1995 and, after several fruit-
 less efforts to persuade the two parties to cooperate, the U.N. Security Council for-
 mally suspended the identification process in May 1996. The U.N. and friendly gov-
 ernments have continued to urge the two parties to seek a political solution to the
 conflict. In March 1997, U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan appointed former U.S.
 Secretary of State James Baker as his personal envoy to examine options for a
 peaceful settlement. Baker visited the region, and negotiations between the Moroc-
 can Government and the Polisario began in May 1997. In September 1997, rep-
 resentatives of Morocco and the Polisario met in Houston in the United States, and
 consented to a series of compromise agreements on the 1991 U.N. Settlement Plan
 to hold a referendum under U.N. auspices. According to the Houston Accords, the
 identification of potential voters, the referendum campaign, and the vote was to
 take place by December. In August MINURSO completed identification of voters in
 all non-contested tribal groupings. In November the U.N. Secretary General visited
 the region to examine ways at achieving compromise on several contested elements
 
 
 1774
 of the settlement plan in order to move the referendum process- forward. After his
 consultations, the Secretary General proposed a series of measures in December to
 both parties. The U.N. continues to maintain a presence in the Western Sahara and
 in Tindouf, Algeria, pending. the outcome of talks on the Secretary General's pro-
 posal.
 ,Since 1977 the Saharan provinces of Laayoune, Smara, and Boujdour have par-
 ticipated in local elections organized and controlled by the Moroccan Government.
 The southern province of Oued Ed Dahab has participated in Moroccan-controlled
 elections since 1983. Sahrawis whose political views are aligned with the Moroccan
 Government fill all the seats allotted to the Western Sahara in the Moroccan Par-
 liam ent.                     I   -
 The civilian population living in the Western Sahara under Moroccan administra-
 tion is subject to Moroccan law. U.N. observers and foreign human rights groups
 maintain that Sahrawis have difficulty obtaining Moroccan passports, that the Gov-
 ernment monitors the political views of Sahrawis more closely  an those of Moroc-
 can citizens, and that the police and paramilitary authorities react especially harsh-
 ly against those suspected of supporting independence and the Polisario Front. The
 Moroccan Government limits access to the territory, and international human rights
 organizations and impartial journalists have sometimes experienced difficulty in se-
 curing admission.
 After years of denying that Sahrawis were imprisoned in Morocco for Polisario-
 related military or political activity, the Government of Morocco released 300 such
 prisoners in 1991. Entire families and Sahrawis who had disappeared in the mid-
 1970's were among those released. The Government of Morocco has failed to conduct
 a public inquiry or to explain why those released spent up to 16 years in incommu-
 nicado detention without charge or trial.
 There are a number of other Sabrawis who reman imprisoned for peaceful pro-
 tests supporting Saharan independence. There-are credible reports that 10 Sahrawis
 were arrested, beaten, and kept in seclusion by-Moroccan authorities in May 1996
 following demonstrations in several cities of the Western Sahara in support of
 Sahrawi independence. These 10 demonstrators have reportedly been sentenced to
 terms of imprisonment raning from 18 months to 7 years.
 Kelthoum el-Ouanat and five other Sahrawis were released in May 1996. El-
 Ouanat had been sentenced to a 20-year term after being arrested in October 1992,
 following a demonstration in Smara. Prior to her trial, she had been held in secret
 detention for up to 10 months during which time she reportedly was beaten, tor-
 tured, and sexually abused. In June 1995, eight Sahrawi youths, arrested for dem-
 onstrating for Sahrawi independence the previous month, were given 20-year sen-
 tences. The' King later commuted these sentences to one year, and the eight were
 released in July 1996, 14,months after having been taken into custody. The youths
 report that the Moroccan police continue to monitor them closely.
 The Polisario Front claims that the Moroccan Government continues to hold sev-
 eral hundred Sahrawis as political prisoners and approximately 300 prisoners of
 war (POW's). The Government formally denies that any Sahrawi noncombatants re-
 main in detention. In October 1996, Morocco released 66 Sahrawi combatants, who
 were flown to the Tindouf area of Algeria under International Committee of the Red
 Cross (ICRC) auspices. They were accompanied by foreign diplomats. The Govern-
 ment claims that 30,000 Sahrawi refugees are detained against their will by the
 Polisario in camps around Tindouf, Algeria. The Polisario denies this charge. There
 are credible reports that the number of refugees in Tindouf far exceeds 30,000, but
 the allegation that they wish to leave remains unsubstantiated.
 The ICRC reports that the Polisario holds approximately 1,900 Moroccan- POW's.
 A group of 185 POW's was repatriated to Morocco in a humanitarian airlift con-
 ducted under ICRC auspices in November 1995. In April 1997 Polisario leaders of-
 fered to release 85 Moroccan POW's as a good will gesture during U.N. envoy
 Baker's first meetings in Tindouf, but Morocco and the Polisario jave not agreed to
 the conditions of their release.
 Both the Moroccan Government and the Polisario Front refuse to repatriate the
 remaining POW's, claiming that the U.N. settlement plan calls for the release of
 POW's only after the identification process is complete.
 Freedom of movement within the Western Sahara is limited in militarily sensitive
 areas. Elsewhere, security forces subject travelers to arbitrary questioning and de-
 tention.
 There is little organizedlabor activity in the Western Sahara. The same labor
 laws that apply in Morocco are applied in the Moroccan-controlled areas of the
 Western Sahara. Moroccan unions are present in the Moroccan-controlled Western
 Sahara but are not active. The 15 percent of the territory outside Moroccan control
 does not have any major population centers or economic activity beyond nomadic
 
 
 1775
 herding. The Polisario-sponsored labor union, the Sario Federation of Labor, is not
 active in the Western Sahara.
 There were no strikes other job actions or collective bargaining agreements during
 the year. Most union members are employees of the Moroccan Government or state-
 owned organizations. Moroccan citizens are paid 85 percent more than their coun-
 terparts outside the Western Sahara as an inducement to live there. Workers in the
 Western Sahara are exempt from income and value-added taxes and receive sub-
 sidies on such commodities as flour, oil, sugar, fuel, and utilities.
 Moroccan law prohibits forced labor, which does not appear to exist in the West-
 ern Sahara.
 Regulations on the minimum age of employment are the same as in Morocco.
 Child labor appears to be less common than in Morocco, primarily because of the
 absence of industries most likely'to employ children, such as rug knotting and gar-
 ment making. A government work program for adults, the Promotion Nationale, pro-
 vides families with a sufficient level of income so that children need not work as
 domestic servants. Children in the few remaining nomadic groups presumably work
 as shepherds along with other group members.
 The minimum wage and maximum hours of work are the same as in Morocco.
 However, in practice workers in some fish processing plants may work as many as
 12 hours per day, 6 days per week, well beyond the 10-hour day, 48-hour week max-
 imum stipulated in Moroccan law. Occupational health and safety standards are the
 same as those enforced in Morocco. They are rudimentary, except for a prohibition
 on the employment of women in dangerous occupations.
