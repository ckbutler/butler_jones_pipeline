 BOTSWANA
 Botswana has maintained the fundamental principles of the
 rule of law, political democracy, and respect for human
 rights throughout its 14 years of independence. The con-
 stitution of Botswana, which came into effect in 1965
 when Botswana was still the British-administered Bechuana-
 land Protectorate, contains what is in effect a bill of
 rights providing for the "protection of fundamental
 rights and freedoms of the individual." The constitutional
 rights are upheld in the courts. Botswana permits
 political dissent; it holds its officials and military
 accountable to an independent judiciary for misconduct in
 office; and it enforces legislation protecting the
 rights of its minorities. Although threatened for several
 years by the fighting in Rhodesia (now the independent
 country of Zimbabwe), Botswana did not resort to a suspen-
 sion of civil liberties on national security grounds.
 Today, with the end of the hostilities and the repatriation
 of over 23,000 Zimbabwean refugees, the Government of
 Botswana continues to provide for the social welfare
 needs and security of approximately 1100 refugees from
 neighboring countries who have sought asylum in this
 country. Botswana is firmly committed to economic
 rights for its people. In sum, Botswana has demonstated
 a strong commitment to political liberties, basic human
 needs, and civil rights.
 1.     Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 Torture is prohibited by Section 7 (1) of Chapter 11
 of the constitution, and there have been no allegations
 of torture in Botswana.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 Such treatment is prohibited by law and is almost
 unknown in practice. While there have been a few
 public allegations of police brutality, particularly
 in connection with suspected diamond thefts, investigations
 by the Attorney General's office have found the allegations
 to be false. There have been no summary executions in
 Botswana. Prison conditions allow for adequate diet and
 health care and visits from family members. Flogging is
 permitted as a punishment for infractions of prison
 rules. It is also used by traditional tribal courts,
 whose jurisdiction is limited to minor offenses, and
 occasionally by the schools for serious cases of disobedi-
 ence. Women are not subject to corporal punishment.
 c.    Disappearances
 The constitution provides for the protection of personal
 liberty and there have been no allegations of secret
 arrests or clandestine detentions.
 
 
 d.    Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 Section 5 of Chapter 2 of the constitution contains
 provisions protecting Botswana citizens from arbitrary
 arrest. There are no political prisoners in Botswana and
 preventive detention is illegal. Habeas corpus exists in
 practice, with a requirement that the police bring a
 suspect before a magistrate for charging within 48 hours
 of his arrest. All suspects must be released at that
 time unless the magistrate issues a warrant of detention.
 During efforts by the government of Botswana in mid-1980
 to relocate South African refugees from the Gaborone area
 to a camp in the northern part of Botswana, there were a
 few reports of arbitrary detentions of refugees who
 refused to move. There also have been reports that two
 apprehended refugees were denied food and water for 24
 hours. If true, this was an isolated incident.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The right to a fair public trial is provided by law
 and is honored in practice. Defendants are entitled to
 counsel, and consultation between defendants and counsel
 may be held in private. Defendants must be charged within
 48 hours of arrest, and the charges must be formally and
 clearly stated. The judiciary is independent of the execu-
 tive and military, and this separation has been upheld even
 in controversial and politically sensitive cases. The high
 court has ruled that the constitution contains an implied
 "fifth amertdment," i.e. that no one may be compelled to
 testify against himself; moreover, silence cannot be con-
 strued as guilt and the burden of proof remains with the
 prosecution. All trials are held in public. Accounts by
 foreign as well as domestic news sources indicate a scrupu-
 lous adherence to established procedures, including the
 rights of defendants.
 There are no special courts to deal with security
 or political offenses. Although the Botswana Defense
 Force Act provides for military courts, none has as yet
 been established, and cases over which the military has
 jurisdiction are referred to the attorney general and
 the civilian court system. There are problems in the
 administration of justice, but they center mainly on the
 difficulty in recruiting sufficient qualified magistrates
 and court reporters.
 f.    Invasion of the Home
 The sanctity of the home is safeguarded by law and
 respected in practice.. A search warrant issued by a
 magistrate is required for an official to enter a private
 residence, except in cases of suspected diamond theft
 and illegal drug transactions when a senior police
 officer may search without a warrant.
 
 
 2.7   Government Policies Relating to the Fulfillment of Such
 Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care and Education
 The government is committed to economic development with
 equity, and has demonstrated sensitivity to the basic
 economic rights of the population. The economy of Bots-
 wana is based on minerals (diamonds and copper/nickel
 matte) and agriculture (beef cattle). Its gross domestic
 product (GDP) per capita for 1978 was $460 as compared with
 $284 in 1973. For the past ten years it has been the gov-
 ernment's strategy to achieve large and rapid returns from
 investment in mining and reinvest these returns to improve
 the living standards of those who do not benefit directly
 from the mining sector -- principally the 87 percent of
 the work force in agriculture. This strategy generated
 resources which have been spent on education and training,
 health services, roads, water supply, and other social
 services.
 As a result of these efforts, life expectancy in 1979
 increased to 48.3 years from 36 years in 1950. The
 literacy rate in 1980 is 42 percent as compared with 33
 percent in 1964. And 83 percent of all children between
 the ages of six and thirteen were in school in 1979,
 as opposed to only 43 percent in 1964.
 The latest national development plan calls for a shift
 from the emphasis on physical and social infrastruc-
 ture to a greater focus on rural development and employ-
 ment creation. Programs to improve rural productivity in
 arable agriculture, commerce, and small-scale industry
 and to raise employment levels are necessarily experimental
 and tentative at the start. The commitment has been made
 to provide the basic economic rights to all population
 groups, however, and the next few years will see how well
 the government is able to meet its goals of: (a) narrowing
 the gap in living standards between those in formal
 sector jobs and those dependent on traditional agriculture;
 (b) maximizing new job opportunities; and (c) preventing
 limited financial resources from being preempted by the
 modern sector.
 Over the past few years Botswana has made progress in
 achieving a more reliable distribution of the nation's
 income. All the same, the most recent rural income distri-
 bution survey for Botswana showed that 40 percent of rural
 households had 12 percent of total rural income; the rich-
 est 10 percent had 42 percent; and the richest 5 percent
 had 30 percent. The reduction of such large differentials
 in income and wealth is a specific economic goal of the
 government. To this end, it has been decided to shift the
 focus of the tribal grazing lands policy to the communal
 areas, which contain the bulk of the smaller herd owners.
 The arable land development program is to focus on the
 60-70,000 farmers who cultivate less than 10 hectares, on
 those rural families who do not have access to draft power,
 and on the 30 percent of families which are headed by
 women.
 Because of the historic need for young boys to herd cattle
 at remote cattle posts, more girls are enrolled in primary
 
 
 school in Botswana than boys. At university level, how-
 ever, there are twice as many men as women enrolled. Be-
 cause of the migration of the men to the urban areas in
 Botswana and to South African mines, women play a key role
 in the rural areas, but they often lack draft power, capi-
 tal and labor. In the cities, where 15 percent of Bots-
 wana's population now live, 80 percent of the jobs are held
 by men. All the same, women are finding increased employ-
 ment in the modern sector. While most of the employed
 women are in the fields of retail selling, nursing, teach-
 ing, and secretarial work, a small but growing number of
 women are entering the professions of law, medicine,
 accounting, and government service, including diplomacy.
 In the modern sector women receive equal pay for equal
 work.
 Botswana has a progressive income tax. The turnover
 tax on revenues .of the Botswana Meat Commission (BMC) is
 borne by cattle producers in proportion to their sales to
 the BMC. Botswana has avoided regressive sales taxes.
 As a result of these practices, the tax burden tends to
 fall on those most able to bear it.
 Government workers are granted periodic pay raises to off-
 set inflation. Employers of urban workers in the private
 sector generally key their wage scales to those of govern-
 ment. The growing, active independent trade union movement
 in Botswana focuses on the economic and social concerns
 of its members. Workers in the modern sector earn wages
 sufficient to provide for human needs and a minimal standard
 of living. Conditions in the work place meet basic safety
 and health standards. Recently women have begun to play
 an increasingly active role in the labor movement, in
 providing for child care facilities, maternity benefits,
 and other family social services.
 The government has vigorously pursued a policy of non-
 racialism and seeks to eliminate discrimination affecting
 the enjoyment of basic economic rights. Although Botswana
 has a nearly homogeneous ethnic population, there are
 three distinct minorities. The Kalanga tribal group in
 northeast Botswana makes up less than five percent of the
 population but is highly represented in the central govern-
 ment and the private sector; this has been a source of
 resentment on the part of many of the majority Tswanas, who
 comprise 90 percent of the population. As a result, some
 tensions exist between Kalangas and the Tswanas, but there
 is no legal discrimination against either group.
 The Basarawa (or Bushmen), who inhabit the Kalahari
 Desert region, have presented a difficult problem.
 Steady incursions of modern agriculture have caused many
 Bushmen (about five percent of the population) to abandon
 their traditional life as nomadic hunters and gatherers.
 Often they have attached themselves to rural families from
 whom they receive very little pay for the services they
 render. The government has undertaken special programs
 to ease the Basarawa's transition to modern life, which
 appears inevitable given the necessity to make efficient
 use of all the nation's land.
 
 
 26
 Although the white and Asian minorities together comprise
 less than two percent of the population, they play a sig-
 nificant role in the economy. Many whites and Asians are
 Botswanan citizens. Their personal and property rights
 are protected by the sane laws that protect all Botswanans.
 3.    Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a.    Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 Freedom of speech, of religion, and of the press are
 guaranteed by the constitution. The people of Botswana
 are free to express independent political ideas in speech
 and peaceful assembly. Opposition political parties exer-
 cise these rights through persistent public criticism of
 the government and the ruling Botswana Democratic Party.
 All of Botswana's information media are operated by the
 government, but they are managed by editorial staffs
 which enjoy considerable independence. Articles strongly
 critical of government policies and officials are fre-
 quently printed. The media adequately cover the activi-
 ties and statements of the political opposition. The
 government has accepted the conclusions of an outside
 report on the media, which recommends private ownership
 of both press and radio. There is no censorship of
 foreign or domestic books and no interference with
 academic inquiry.
 Labor unions have the right to organize, strike, bargain
 collectively and lobby. No professional groups have
 experienced persecution or harassment. There is no state
 or favored religion, and those affiliated with minority
 religions are not discriminated against in their.civil,
 economic, or political status.
 b.    Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration and Repatriation
 Botswana citizens are subject to virtually no restrictions
 on domestic movement or foreign travel. There are no
 restrictions on emigration or repatriation.
 Currently, there are about 1,100 refugees in Botswana.
 Of these, about 700 are South Africans, 220 are Angolans,
 100 are Basotho (from Lesotho), 80 are Namibians, and a
 handful are from other neighboring countries. Early in
 1980, following the departure of.23,000 Zimbabwean
 refugees to newly independent Zimbabwe, the government
 decided to move all refugees who were neither gainfully
 employed nor in an educational program to the Dukwe
 resettlement camp in a rural area of northern Botswana.
 Many of the South African refugees resisted the move and
 complained loudly to the government and local interna-
 tional organizations. Several of the South Africans, in
 fact, left the country rather than make the move to Dukwe.
 They are expected to obtain permission to leave the camp
 which is not fenced.
 In cooperation with international agencies, the government
 is providing educational programs, sports activities, and
 other recreational and business opportunities for the
 
 
 27
 refugees at Dukwe. Refugees, as all foreigners in Bots-
 wana, are subject to some job restrictions. There have
 been allegations of forced returns of one or two refugees
 to South Africa. There are now about 10-20 refugees
 entering Botswana each month.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Botswana is a multi-party parliamentary democracy based
 on constitutionally guaranteed universal suffrage. Its
 citizens enjoy complete freedom. to participate in politics
 by voting, engaging in party activities, and in publicly
 advocating proposed policies. In the October, 1979,
 parliamentary elections, three opposition parties chal-
 lenged the ruling Botswana Democratic Party (BDP) in free
 and open elections in which secret ballots were cast.
 While the ruling BDP contested all 32 constituencies, the
 Botswana National Front (BNF) contested 16 (one short of
 the number constitutionally required to elect a presi-
 dent), the Botswana Peoples Party (BPP) contested 14, and
 the small Botswana Independence Party (BIP) contested only
 five. Since the opposition parties tend to have regional
 bases, however, no BDP candidate ran unopposed. Only the
 BDP and the BNF put forward candidates for the presidency.
 The government made a strong effort to persuade eligible
 Botswanans to participate in the electoral process.
 Women have full political rights in.Botswana. In practice
 women are increasingly participating in political life.
 There are two women members of Parliament, both of whom
 are cabinet ministers. There is one white member of
 Parliament, who is also a cabinet minister. The speaker
 of the National Assembly is also white.
 4.    Government Attitude and Record Regarding International
 and Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Botswana welcomes the attention and interest of the out-
 side world in its human rights situation, including its
 treatment of refugees. Its record of cooperation with
 international agencies involved in assisting refugees has
 been excellent. At present, there are no Botswana-based
 organizations set up to observe, report, or contest human
 rights violations. The government has a positive attitude
 toward international human rights bodies and consistently
 responds promptly and forthrightly to the inquiries it
 receives about the human rights situation in Botswana.
