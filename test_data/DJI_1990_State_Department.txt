 DJIBOUTI
 Djibouti is a one-party state ruled since independence in 1977
 by President Hassan Gouled Aptidon and his People's Assembly
 for Progress (RPP), which has been the only lawful political
 party since 1981. Public life in Djibouti is dominated by two
 ethnic groups, the politically predominant Issa (the
 Somali-origin tribe of the President) and the Afar (who are
 also numerous in Ethiopia). The Afar are the largest single
 tribe, but they are outnumbered by the combined Somali ethnic
 elements in Djibouti, among whom the Issa are the largest and
 most influential component. The Presidency is considered
 reserved for an Issa, and the Prime Ministry for an Afar. The
 various ethnic groups are represented proportionally in the
 Cabinet and political bodies, which results in a dominant role
 for the Issa in the civil service, party, and armed forces.
 Djibouti's security services include an army of around 3,500
 total personnel and three national police forces: the
 National Security Force (FNS) and the National Police, both
 under the Ministry of the Interior, and the Gendarmerie, under
 the Ministry of Defense. The latter has been involved in
 human rights violations. France guarantees Djibouti's
 external security and maintains a force of some 3,800 military
 personnel in Djibouti.
 Djibouti's arid soil is unproductive, and there is no
 industry; commerce and services for the 10,000 expatriate
 (mostly French) residents, and operation of the seaport and
 airport account for most of the gross domestic product.
 Although the State is the largest employer, persons are free
 to pursue private business interests and to hold personal and
 real property.
 Human rights continue to be tightly circumscribed in
 Djibouti. Areas of continuing abuse include the denial of
 political pluralism; limitations on freedom of speech, press,
 and assembly; instances of arbitrary arrest and detention;
 refusal to recognize the refugee rights of Somali nationals
 fleeing the Somali civil war; societal discrimination against
 women; and occasional abusive treatment of detainees by the
 Gendarmerie. Instances of deportation of Somali asylum
 seekers continued in 1990 but dropped substantially in the
 latter half of the year.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 There were no instances of political or other extrajudicial
 killing.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no instances of disappearance of persons for
 political reasons.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 There was one credible report of torture by the security
 services during 1990. Five young men of the Afar tribe were
 
 
 104
 DJIBOUTI
 arrested in late August, apparently for engaging in political
 agitation and distributing copies of an article from a Paris
 weekly claiming that the Government of Hassan Gouled had
 signed a secret defense accord with the Government of Iraq.
 All were held at the offices of the Gendarmerie from 1 to 4
 days, during which time they were subjected to beatings. The
 first of the group to be arrested was tortured, apparently to
 obtain the names of the other four. He was allegedly
 subjected to electric shocks on the soles of his feet and
 forced to ingest water until he lost consciousness.
 Although this was the only report of methodical torture
 received during 1990, the security services--and the
 Gendarmerie in particular--have earned a reputation for
 beatings and other abusive treatment of detainees which
 continued undiminished in 1990. For example, there were
 unconfirmed reports that four young men arrested in connection
 with a September grenade attack on a local cafe were beaten
 during their interrogation. The four later recanted their
 confessions, claiming that they had been tortured.
 Prison conditions are harsh, especially in Nagad Prison where
 many Somali asylum seekers have been held.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 By law, a person may be detained no more than 48 hours without
 an examining magistrate's formal charge. In practice, this
 deadline is ignored in cases of political interest. An
 accused has the right to counsel, which is provided by the
 State if the accused is destitute. An accused person awaiting
 trial may, by a judge's order, be released on bail or personal
 recognizance or be jailed pending the verdict.
 Omar Daoud, leader of a small armed Afar opposition group, was
 arrested in June. Late in the year, he was under guard in a
 hospital recovering from wounds received during the shootout
 that resulted in his capture.
 There is one significant opposition group in exile, the United
 Movement for Democracy, based in Paris and led by former
 Commerce Minister Aden Robleh.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Djibouti's legal system is a mixture of Djiboutian legislation
 and executive decrees, French codified law adopted at
 independence, Shari'a (Islamic law), and the traditions of the
 native nomadic peoples. Crimes in urban areas are dealt with
 according to French-inspired law and judicial practice in the
 regular courts. Civil actions may be brought in the regular
 courts or in traditional courts according to tribal customs.
 Shari'a courts handle only family matters (marriage, divorce,
 inheritance, etc.). Decisions of all three court systems may
 be appealed to the Supreme Court.
 A special State Security Court may hear in closed session
 cases of espionage, treason, and acts threatening the public
 order or the "interest of the Republic." This Court last
 convened in 1986.
 Proceedings in all courts except the State Security Court are
 open to the public. The judiciary appears to be generally
 sympathetic to the government position and susceptible to
 government influence in cases of political interest. There
 
 
 105
 DJIBOUTI
 can be long delays in bringing such cases to trial. The
 Tunisian national charged with the fatal 1987 terrorist
 bombing of an outdoor cafe remained in prison awaiting trial
 at the end of 1990. The handling of another security-related
 case suggested that persons may be held on weak evidence for
 political rather than evidentiary reasons.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 There were no reported instances of arbitrary interference
 with privacy, family, home, or correspondence in 1990.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 These freedoms are restricted. Those who express public views
 that are critical of, or perceived as threatening to, the
 Government face prosecution for common crimes or detention
 without charge for short periods. Amnesty International's
 1990 report highlights the cases of 6 persons detained for
 several months in 1989 for criticizing the Government.
 Djibouti's radio and television stations and one newspaper (a
 French-language weekly) are all government owned and
 operated. The Government's avowed policy is to coordinate the
 dissemination of information "in the interest of national
 development." The news media do report on social and national
 development problems in Djibouti, but the Government itself
 and its policies are not criticized. The media largely avoid
 reporting on domestic politics and ethnic strife in
 neighboring Somalia and Ethiopia, although reporting on
 regional turmoil and political movements throughout Africa
 increased significantly in 1990 compared with previous years.
 As a rule, the Government does not censor or forbid the
 importation of books, magazines, or newspapers. However,
 copies of one issue of a Paris weekly newspaper were removed
 from newstands in September because of an article alleging a
 secret defense accord between Djibouti and Iraq. Five young
 Afar men who were distributing photocopies of the article were
 arrested (see Section l.c.).
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.
 The Government effectively bans political protest by selective
 enforcement of public assembly permit laws. Permits for
 political meetings are not issued outside party auspices, and
 it appears that permits for such purposes are rarely sought.
 Peaceful assembly and association for nonpolitical purposes
 are routinely permitted.
 There are no institutions of higher education in Djibouti. A
 strike in February by students protesting a reduction in
 scholarships for overseas study was handled in typical
 fashion. The students were allowed to stage their sit-down
 strike in front of the school for a short period but were then
 rounded up by the police, held overnight at a juvenile
 detention center, and later released to their parents. None
 was held more than 48 hours, and no ill treatment was
 .reported. A similar strike in November was allowed to proceed
 without police interference.

 c. Freedom of Religion
 Djibouti respects freedom of religion for all faiths.
 Virtually the entire population is Sunni Muslim. The holy
 days of Islam are legal holidays, and the Government and all
 private offices observe Islam's month of Ramadan with a
 shortened workday. However, the Government imposes no
 sanctions on those who choose to ignore Islamic teachings on
 diet, alcohol consumption, or religious fasting.
 The expatriate community supports Roman Catholic, French
 Protestant, and Greek and Ethiopian Orthodox churches. Less
 than 1 percent of the native population belongs to these
 Christian congregations. Foreign clergy and missionaries may
 perform charitable works, but proselytizing is a sensitive
 issue and, while not illegal, is discouraged.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Djiboutians travel freely within Djibouti and may live and
 work where they choose. Djiboutians leave for, and return
 from, international travel without restriction or
 interference. Passports are available to all Djiboutians but
 are invalid for travel to Israel or South Africa.
 Djibouti cooperates with the United Nations High Commissioner
 for Refugees (UNHCR) to assist and protect the approximately
 1,500 registered Ethiopian refugees in the country. As a
 matter of policy, however, the Government does not recognize
 as refugees the approximately 35,000 Somali nationals who have
 fled the Somali civil war. The Government has an informal
 agreement with UNHCR that these refugees will not be forcibly
 repatriated if they do not "cause trouble." However, the
 UNHCR in fact has limited ability to extend protection to
 these persons, and the Government continued to repatriate
 forcibly Somali asylum seekers as "illegal aliens," especially
 during the first half of 1990. This policy was curtailed in
 the latter half of the year, but an estimated 100 Somali
 asylum seekers were deported to Ethiopia and Somalia in the
 first half of 1990. Roughly 50 undocumented Somali and
 Ethiopian nationals were deported to Ethiopia after having
 allegedly participated in Iraqi-inspired demonstrations in
 August.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Citizens do not have the right to change their form of
 government through democratic means. All legal political
 activity is conducted within Djibouti's single party, the
 People's Assembly for Progress (RPP). As in most Djiboutian
 institutions, the Issas have a dominant role in the RPP, which
 has had a monopoly of power since the rival Djiboutian
 People's Movement (MPD) was outlawed in 1981. The party
 chooses the candidates for the Presidency and the 65-member
 National Assembly, a legislative body with limited power.
 Presidential and National Assembly elections are held every 7
 and 5 years respectively. Citizens are encouraged to vote,
 but their only choice is whether to cast a ballot for or
 against the party's candidates. The two different ballots
 must be cast in different boxes, making it obvious who votes
 against the party.

 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government has refused repeated attempts by a small group
 of Djiboutians to register formally a "Djiboutian League for
 Human Rights." The Government has generally responded to
 inquiries from international human rights and humanitarian
 organizations concerning human rights practices,-and such
 groups may visit and travel in Djibouti.
 Amnesty International (AI) wrote to the Minister of Interior
 in 1989 concerning the case of Abdulqadir Daoud, who died in
 custody, possibly of torture. The Minister replied that Daoud
 had died in a hospital after a heart attack. The Government
 did not reply to AI's subsequent request for an investigation.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 The dominant status of the Issa in the party, the civil
 service, and the military is reinforced by de facto
 discrimination based on tribe and language against the Afar,
 and discrimination based on tribe against the Isaak and
 Gadaboursi.
 Women in Djibouti legally possess full civil rights, but
 traditionally play a secondary role in public life. Women are
 active in small trade, as well as in the clerical and
 secretarial fields. There are women, though only a few, in
 the professions (civil service, judiciary, teaching, and
 medicine) and in the police and armed forces.
 According to medical personnel, violence against women-
 including rape and wife beating--may have increased somewhat
 during 1990. However, while data are'limited, such violence
 is still considered a relatively infrequent occurrence.
 Neither the Government nor the party-affiliated Djiboutian
 National Women's Union (UNFD) has addressed the issue. Most
 domestic and community violence is considered a family or clan
 matter, dealt with accordingly, and therefore rarely brought
 to the attention of authorities. In November 1988, the UNFD
 began a government-supported campaign against female
 circumcision. Progress in the campaign has been slow,
 particularly in the northern districts, where nomadic
 traditions of genital mutilation of young girls (e.g.,
 clitoral excision and the more extreme practice of
 infibulation) have been widely practiced.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Workers are free to join or not join unions as they choose,
 but only a small percentage of Djiboutian workers are union
 members. Trade unions, therefore, play a minimal role in
 Djibouti. Many unions represent employees of only a single
 private or state-owned enterprise. The Government exerts
 control over individual unions through the single,
 state-organized labor central, the General Union of Djiboutian
 Workers (UGTD). The UGTD is a member of Africa's
 continent-wide official trade union body, the Organization of
 African Trade Union Unity. Unions are free to maintain
 relations and exchange programs with unions and labor
 organizations in other countries.

 DJIBOUTI
 Workers are free to strike, but in practice most labor actions
 are limited to short, wildcat strikes.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 The law recognizes labor's right to organize and collective
 bargaining. In practice, formal collective bargaining is
 virtually nonexistent. Relations between workers and
 employers are informal and paternalistic. On questions of
 wages and health and safety conditions, the Ministry of Labor
 encourages direct, ad hoc resolution by labor representatives
 and employers. Either workers or employers may initiate a
 formal administrative hearing at which the Labor Inspection
 Service of the Ministry of Labor mediates. Discrimination
 against labor unions is prohibited by law, and there were no
 known instances of discrimination in 1990. There are no
 export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Forced and compulsory labor are prohibited by law and do not
 exist.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 The legal minimum age of 14 years is respected in practice.
 Children may and do work in family-owned businesses such as
 restaurants and small shops, including at night. Children are
 not employed under hazardous conditions. The Ministry of
 Labor is responsible for enforcement of child labor laws.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 Minimum wage rates are specified by government regulations
 according to occupational categories, and are enforced by the
 Ministry of Labor. Last increased in 1976, minimum wages
 range from $80 a month for unskilled laborers to $1,400 a
 month for "directors" and medical doctors. Many workers also
 receive housing or housing allowances and. transportation and
 food allowances, in addition to mandatory seniority bonuses.
 These amounts are not entirely adequate to provide a worker
 and his family with a decent standard of living.
 By law, the maximum workweek is 40 hours, often spread over 6
 days. Overtime pay regulations are in effect. Workers are
 guaranteed daily and weekly rest periods and paid annual
 vacations. The Ministry of Labor effectively enforces
 occupational health and safety standards, wages, and work
 hours through a system of inspection, dispute mediation, and
 administrative action by the Labor Inspection Service.
