 REPUBLIC OF KOREA
 The Republic of Korea (ROK), which began its transition to a democracy in 1987,
 held National Assembly elections in March 1992 and presidential elections in De-
 cember. On December 18, Koreans elected Kim Young Sam of the Democratic Lib-
 eral Party as their next president. When inaugurated on February 25 1993, Kim
 will be the first civilian chief executive in nearly three decades. Mayorai and guber-
 natorial elections, scheduled for 1992, were postponed. Although North Korea re-
 mained a military threat, high-level talks between North and South Korea to imple-
 ment landmark agreements signed in December 1991 continued until suspended at
 the end of the year. In August the ROK and China established formal diplomatic
 
 
 593
 relations. Democratization continued, but elements of the ROKs authoritarian past
 survive.
 In 1992 the powerful National Security Planning Agency (NSP) and other security
 services continued to collect information on a wide variety of people, including oppo-
 sition politicians student radicals, and labor activists, and to detain pepie who
 held views the dovernment considered dangerous, principally those who advocated
 approaches to North Korea or Communist ideologies not sanctioned by the Govern-
 ment.
 Total military expenditures for 1989, the last year for which the U.S. Arms Con-
 trol and Disarmament Agency conducted a detailed analysis, were $9 billion. While
 the rate of increase of defense expenditures has gradually slowed, there is little pub-
 lic pressure exerted or other indication that the Government will initiate measures
 to reduce such spending in the near future.
 The ROK in the last 30 years has become a major industrial power and trading
 nation. An industrious and literate population compensates for a lack of important
 natural resources, especially oil. The economy which exhibited strong growth and
 fairly high inflation in recent years, showed clear signs of sharp deceleration. The
 growth of gross national product in 1992 was estimated at under 5 percent, and in-
 flation at about 6.6 percent. Continued high levels of rural migration to the cities,
 labor shortages, unbalanced regional development, and inadequate infrastructure
 remained problems.
 In 1992 democratic ideals and practices had not fully supplanted undemocratic
 practices left over from the pre-1987 era. A particular problem was continued use
 of broad security laws which, although designed to thwart subversion by pro-North
 Korean forces, were frequently used to punish the nonviolent expression of opinion
 or the exercise of the freedom of association or travel. Other problems were cam-
 paign and voting irregularities, denial or restriction of the right to legal counsel for
 detainees and prisoners, continuing instances of police abuse of detainees (in both
 political and nonpolitical cases), discrimination and violence against women, and
 labor laws and practices which do not meet international labor standards. Tihere
 were fewer student demonstrations and strikes, which reduced the level of con-
 frontation with, and arrests by, police.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reported cases of po-
 litical or extrajudicial killings, but one person died in official custody under cir-
 cumstances that were in dispute (see Section 1e.).
 b. Disappearance.There were no accusations of disappearances during 1992.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Credible allegations of cruel treatment by the authorities continued to be made. The
 authorities place much emphasis on extracting confessions from suspects. There ap-
 pears to be widespread aceptance of the use of force among policemen. Although
 political cases receive the most publicity mistreatment of people detained or ar-
 rested for nonpolitical crimes is common. In both cases, the misreatment reportedly
 includes acute sleep deprivation, verbal abuse, and beatings. There was a report of
 a suspect held on criminal charges dying while in police custody. Authorities claim
 the suspect died of a heart attack. A Korean human rights group suspects police
 brutality may have contributed to the death.
 In a number of political cases, particularly those involving members of groups
 which the Government views as antitate" ther were credible allegations that au-
 thorities used physical and mental abuse during the investigation phase of their de-
 tention. In September Nam Yoon Son, a former union chairwoman, stated that the
 NSP forced her, partly through sleep deprivation, to write a confession that Choi
 Ho Kyong, who was accused of espionage on bhalf of North Korea, ordered her to
 work in the labor movement. In early March, five members of the banned teachers'
 union Chonkyojo alleged that, when they were taken into custody for holding an ille-
 gal demonstration, police abused them after several of them refused to be
 fingerprinted.
 % an important case, a Seoul district court ruled against the Government and
 awarded prominent dissident Kim Keun Tae monetary compensation for physical in-
 juries and mental suffering he experienced as a result of police torture in September
 1985.
 In March a witness in the criminal investigation of fraud by a former member
 of the ruling party's central committee accused two police officers of beating him
 during questioning. The case is still under investigation. In July three policemen,
 hired by another man, kidnaped and held a woman hostage for 4 hours until she
 
 
 gave them over $250 000 from a real estate transaction. The three policemen were
 reportedly discharged after the victim complained to the local press that the au-
 thorities had stalled the investigation. The courts found two policemen guilty of
 beating to death a 19-year-old student in December 1991 but gave them suspended
 sentences. Between 1987 and the end of August 1992, 11 of 260 charges filed with
 prosecutors concerning torture or cruelty by the authorities led to indictments. The
 courts found for the plaintiffs in 10 cases and ordered authorities to pay compensa-
 tion.
 Although there were markedly fewer demonstrations in 1992, student demonstra-
 tors continued to use violence, throwing firebombs and rocks at U.S. government fa-
 cilities and at Korean government offices, particularly police stations, and hitting
 riot police with steel pipes. In May students stormed and occupied the ruling partys
 headquarters in Seoul until riot police entered the building and took the students
 into custody.
 In general, Korean police in demonstration situations showed restraint and dis-
 cipline often in the face of severe provocation. There were reports, however that
 riot poice hit and kicked student protesters when taking them into custody. Police
 officials publicly announced that, after 339 policemen were injured by students
 throwing firebombs and wielding steel pipes during the Chondaehyop Congress in
 May, they had permitted riot police to use long wooden bamboo sticks to defend
 themselves in confrontations with student demonstrators. During protests surround-
 ing Korea's August 15 Liberation Day, police were armed with long bamboo sticks
 and, on at least two occasions, steel pipes. Student demonstrators also reportedly
 captured from riot police steel-reinforced bamboo sticks. After the August 15 pro-
 tests, police announced that they had punished a policeman for possession of a steel-
 reinforced bamboo pole and reprimanded the police platoon leader and captain in
 charge.
 Conditions in Korean prisons remain harsh but have reportedly improved some-
 what in the last few years. Most accusations of mistreatment involved persons de-
 tained for investigation or awaiting trial in detention facilities, rather than those
 who were already convicted and serving their sentences in jail.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Several restrictive laws permit the Gov-
 ernment to detain persons whose views it considers dangerous, particularly people
 accused of involvement in activities in support of North Korea. In actual application,
 the Government used the law to inhibit or punish the free expression of opinion or
 freedom of movement or association. The most prominent of these laws is the Na-
 tional Security Law (NSL), which defines espionage in broad terms. Other restric-
 tive laws include the Law on Assemblies and Demonstrations the Social Surveil-
 lance Law (SSL), labor laws, and election laws. Article 7 of the NSL permits impris-
 onment of persons who "praise, encourage, or cooperate with antistate organizations
 or their members or persons who received orders from them, or by other methods
 benefit antistate organizations." North Korea has been defined as an "antistate or-
 ganization." The Prosecutor General reported to the National Assembly that indict-
 ments of people under the NSL, Law on Assembly and Demonstration, and labor-
 related laws, in a 1-year period ending in August, declined by over half (from 3,347
 to 1,574), compared with the same period in 1990-91. Under the NSL, indictments
 numbered 439 (down by over a third), under the Law on Assembly and Demonstra-
 tion 294 (down by three-quarters), and under labor-related laws 84 (an increase of
 over 40 percent).
 The Government continued to justify its broad security laws and the resulting re-
 strictions by arguing that Korea is in a "special situation" because the Korean war
 ended with the sigmng of an armistice, not a peace treaty, and North Korea remains
 a formidable military threat.
 From August to November, the NSP arrested over 60 people under the NSL on
 charges of spying for or being of help to North Korea. Two were members of Kim
 Dae Jung's party, Deputy Spokesman Kim Bu Kyom and National Assembly De-
 fense Committee staffer LeeKun Hee. Dissidents arrested in the "North Korean spy
 ring" incident included Kim Nack Joong, a reunification and labor activist, and
 Chang Ki Pyo, who ran unsuccessfully for a National Assembly seat in 1992.
 The NSP also detained, questioned, and then released others in the case, includ-
 ing Kim Nack Joong's wife and leaders of the now defunct People's Party, which
 fielded candidates in the 1992 National Assembly elections. The NSP presented to
 the public substantial evidence, including prisoner confessions and caches it had
 found containing $1 million, pistols with silencers and bullets, radio transmitters,
 and code books, to back us the espionage charges. The media had access to some
 of the accused. The NSP alowed most, but not all, spy case prisoners access to legal
 counsel, which is a constitutional right in Korea. The NSP rejected some requests
 from attorneys for access to spy case prisoners. but these rejections were overturned
 
 
 595
 later by the courts. The trial of spy case prisoners started in November, but there
 was no verdict at year's end.
 The Government continued to arrest, indict, and bring to trial students, political
 oponent, and workers on charges of supporti      No     Korea, professing leftist
 ideologies including that of North Korean leader Kim II Sung's juche thought, and
 violent revolution. Ten members of the Socialist Labor Party Formation Committee,
 including Chairman Chu Dae Hwan, were arrested under the NSL, but most of
 them received suspended sentences. The authorities also arrested and indicted over
 65 members of the Socialist Workers Alliance, charging them with forming an "anti-
 state organization." Members of the South Korean headquarters of the Pan-National
 Committee for Reunification (Pomminnyon), Socialists International, and Federation
 of Anyang District Independent Student Movement were charged under the NSL
 with forming antistate groups and instigating illegal demonstrations.
 The authorities declared that reunification events planned by Pomminnyon and
 other groups to celebrate August 15, the anniversary of Korea's liberation from Jap-
 anese occupation, in conjunction with North Korea violated the NSL by "benefiting
 the enemy.' In the summer, authorities arrested students and oppositionists who
 planned the events, including Chondaehyop President Tae Chas Chun, who was also
 charged under the NSL with talking over the telephone with a North Korean stu-
 dent committee in Berlin.
 In August authorities released prominent opposition figure Kim Keun Tae from
 prison upon completion of his 2-year sentence for violating the NSL and the Law
 on Assemblies and Demonstrations. One of the charges against Kim was aiding the
 enemy by reading his organization's charter at a rally. In mid-November, Kim re-
 ceived four summonses from police who were investigating whether a speech he
 gave at a rally violated an election ban on public statements of support for, or oppo-
 sition to, presidential candidates and political parties. Kim Chong Sik, a former
 Chondaehyop president, was sentenced in January for his involvement in the 1991
 visit of two university students to Pyongyang without ROK government permission
 as well as for involvement in illegal, violent demonstrations. A Seoul district court
 turned down a defense argument that the NSL was no Iongr constitutional after
 South and North Korea joined the United Nations and signe  d anmark agreements
 on reconciliation, nonaggression, exchanges, and coopration in 1991. In April the
 Supreme Court upheld the sentence of le in prison or Park Noh Hae, head of the
 Socialist Workers Alliance, for violating the NSL by forming an antistate organiza-
 tion and advocating violent revolution with the purpose of establishing a Socialist
 state. Six days after the December 18 presidential election, President Roh pardoned
 Im Su Kyong and Father Mun Kyu Hyon, who were arrested in 1989 under the NSL
 for their highly-publicized trip to Pyongyang. President Roh also reduced the prison
 sentence of Moon Ik Hwan, who had also traveled to North Korea without permis-
 sion from the South Korean Government.
 Warrants issued by judges are required by law in cases of arrest, detention, sei-
 zure, or search. The law does not require the authorities to seek warrants if the per-
 son is apprehended while committing a criminal act, or if a judge is not available
 and the authorities think that the suspect may destroy evidence or escape capture
 if not quickly arrested. In such emergency cases, judges must issue arrest warrants
 within 48 hours, or, if a court is not located in the same county, 72 hours. Police
 can detain suspects who voluntarily come in for questioning for up to 6 hours but
 must notify the suspect's family. Lawyers charge that the authorities often abuse
 the procedure by holding suspects for up to 24 to 48 hours.
 Upon issuance of an arrest warrant, the security services can hold suspects during
 the investigation phase for up to 30 days before an indictment is made. Article 19
 of the NSL gives judges the power to a pprove requests to extend the detention pe-
 riod an additional 20 days, making legaldetention for up to 50 days. In April, how-
 ever, the Constitutional Court ruled that while the authorities can extend detention
 beyond the legal limit of 30 days for those suspected of 'serious" violations such as
 spying or organizing an antistate group, they cannot do so in cases where the sus-
 pects are charged only with praising North Korea or failing to report NSL viola-
 tions.
 The Constitution specifically provides the right to representation by an attorney,
 but in practice attorneys are not allowed to be present during interrogation. There
 are often no facilities for private meetings between suspects and their attorneys.
 During 1992 the courts continued to issue important rulings protecting a defend-
 ant's right to counsel. In January the Constitutional Court ruled that NSP officials
 violated the Constitution when they tape-recorded a meeting between Yu Sang Ok,
 olic chief for the banned Teachers' Union Chonkyojo, and his defense attorney. In
 ApIl a Seoul high court upheld a lower court ruling ordering authorities to pay
 
 
 compensation to a lawyer who was twice prevented by police from seeing his client,
 who was arrested under the NSL
 Nonetheless, the authorities continued to block or to make access difficult to legal
 counsel for suspects under interrogation or in detention awaiting trial, espally in
 political cases. In late August, Kim Nack Joong's wife, Kim Nam Ki, alleged that
 when her husband was arrested, the NSP, without arrest or search warrants, took
 her and her two daughters into custody, searched their house, and held them incom-
 municado for about 10 days. Lawyers were also denied access to the defendants im-
 mediately following their arrest.
 There is a functioning system of bail in Korea. The right to a judicial determina-
 tion of the legality of a person's detention was deleted from the Code of Criminal
 Conduct in 1973, partially restored in 1980, and then fully restored in late 1987.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution provides defendants a number
 of rights in criminal trials, including presumption of innocence, protection against
 self-incrimination, freedom from retroactive laws and double jeopardy, the right to
 a speedy trial, and the right of appeal. When a person is physically detainel, his
 initial trial must be completed within 6 months of'arrest. These rights are generally
 observed. Trials are open to the public, but the judge may restrict attendance if he
 believes the spectators may seek to disrupt the proeedings.
 The President, with the consent of the National Assembly, appoints the Chief Jus-
 tice and the other justices of the Supreme Court for a term of 6 years. Lower court
 justices are appointed by the Chief Justice with the consent of the other justices.
 The President also appoints the justices of the Constitutional Court.
 Judges generally alow considerable scope for examination of witnesses by both
 the prosecution and defense counsel. The right to an attorney is frequently ignored
 in political cases until the initial investigation is completed. Political and criminal
 cases are tried by the same courts; military courts do not try civilians. Although
 convictions are rarely overturned, appeals often result in reduced sentences. Death
 sentences are automatically appealed. Although historically the executive branch
 has exercised great influence on judicial decisions, there has been increasing judicial
 independence in recent years. In a series of cases, the courts ruled against the Gov-
 ernment to uphold the right of detainees and prisoners to legal representation, to
 award compensation to torture victim Kim Keun Tae, and to recognize an independ-
 ent labor federation of hospital workers. The role of the Constitutional Court, which
 began opration in 1988, continued to grow in 1992.
 is difficult to estimate the number of political prisoners, i.e., those jailed for ex-
 erising their political rights unaccompanied by violence, because many people are
 detained and then released without charges, or are charged and then released with-
 out being tried. It is extremely difficult to determine whether particular persons
 were arrested for merely exercising the right of free association or were detained
 for committing violent acts during demonstrations or illegal wildcat strikes. In Sep-
 tember Amnesty International estimated that there were about 20 prisoners of con-
 science and about 90 other possible prisoners of conscience, which it defines as peo.
 ple imprisoned solely because of their beliefs, sex, ethnic origin, language, or reli-
 gion and who have neither used nor advocated violence. By the end of 1992 because
 of continued prosecutions under the vague NSL and other security-related laws, it
 appeared that the number of political prisoners and detainees as defined by inter-
 national human rights standards remained in the hundreds.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-In gen-
 eral the Government honors the integrity of the home and family. Nevertheless,
 many political and religious figures were still subjected to varying degrees of gov-
 ernment surveillance. Security officials have admitted that thousands of former NSL
 detainees remain under surveillance. During a press conference a few weeks before
 National Assembly elections, the United People's Party (UPP) alleged that the Gov-
 ernment had tapped t he p arty's telephones. In April wiretapping devices were dis-
 covered on the telephone lines of Kim Ung Kwon, Pomminnyon Secretary General,
 as well as Deputy  airman Kim Hee Sen, who was being sought under the NSL.
 In June Mingahyop, an association of families of political prisoners, charged that
 it had mailed funds provided by an international human rights organization to polit-
 ical prisoners, but that prison authorities had refused to pass the money to the pris-
 oners and instead returned it. There were credible reports that private American
 citizens were subject to intrusive surveillance by the authorities.
 The Government and the courts took a few tentative steps to limit encroachments
 on the individual's right to privacy. In February the Constitutional Court ruled that
 the Military Secrets Protection Law was toobroad and that it threatened to en-
 croach on basic constitu tionnal Assembly has a bll that would
 restrict, to a limited extent, the collection and use of public information by govern-
 ment aPencies and institutions.
 
 
 The security presence in city centers, near university campuses, government
 buildings, ruling party offlces, and media outlets is heavy. Citizens, particularly stu-
 dents and young people, are sometimes stopped, questioned, and searched. Govern-
 ment informants are known to be posted on and around university campuses. Per-
 sons thought to have backgrounds as political or labor activists are still denied some
 forms of employment and advancement, particularly in government, the broadcast
 media, and education.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-Much political discourse remains unrestricted,
 although limits on the expression of ideas that the Government considers Com-
 munist or pro-North Korea remain severe, and the Government definition is so
 broad that it often includes persons who attempt to express nonviolently views
 which the Government opposes (see Section 1.d.). In late October, the arrest and in-
 dictment of famous writer and.professor Ma Kwong Soo and his publisher on pr-
 nography charges (for Ma's new sexually explicit novel) sparked a debate on the lim-
 its of freedom of speech.
 Direct control over the print media has virtually disappeared. There remained,
 however, credible accusations of government pressure on te media in certain cases
 involvin the "dignity" of the President. In August, in response to a lawsuit lodged
 by the residents astaff, prosecutors called in for questioning a reporter for the Ob-
 server magazine about an article concerning allegations of a secret fund set up by
 the President's Office for Election Campaigns, and about President Roh's retire-
 ment.
 Prosecutors also investigated a reporter from the dissident daily Hankyoreh
 Shinmun for writing a report quoting the Observer article. No charpes were brought
 in either case. In a suit brought by the dissident biweekly Chongminnyon Shinmun,
 the Constitutional Court ruled unconstitutional the requirement that publishers
 must own printing facilities before the Government grants a publishing license,
 holding that publishers need only show evidence of access to such equipment. The
 Government had used the regulation to restrict antigovernment publications.
 The Government continued to apply the NSL against publishers, printers, and
 distributors who produce or sell "subversive" literature. The NSL remained the Gov-
 ernment's main weapon to suppress domestic dissent and to inhibit unauthorized
 communications and exchanges with North Korea. In 1992 the Government arrested
 students for violating the NSL by waving North Korean flags during protests. The
 Supreme Court reaffirmed a high court ruling that a high school teacher was not
 guilty of violating the NSL when he publicly supported Rev. Moon Ik Hwan's "ille-
 gal" trip to North Korea. Controls on information continued. Listening to North Ko-
 rean radio is illegal if the authorities judge it is for the purpose of "benefiting the
 antistate organization," i.e., North Korea. The Supreme Court has ruled that it was
 legal under the NSL to possess publications "benefiting the enemy" for purely aca-
 demic use, profit, or curiosity, but not if it was with the intent of aiding "the
 enemy." In April the Citizens' Coalition for a Fair Election revealed that the armed
 forces, before the National Assembly elections, had distributed to military units a
 blacklist of 574 "seditious" books, including writings by the ruling Democratic Lib-
 erai Party Executive Chairman Kim Young Sam.
 Despite restrictions on the production or sale of "subversive" literature, the Gov-
 ernment allowed, within its guidelines, an increase in media coverage of North
 Korea. Television networks broadcast edited versions of North Korean television
 programs on a weekly basis. The media extensively reported on talks between South
 and North Korean officials, sending reporters to cover talks in North Korea. The
 Government also allowed somewhat wider public access to selected North Korean
 publications. The December 1991 landmark agreements between South and North
 orea included prvisions for exchanges and cooperation in publishing, journalism,
 radio, and television, which South Korea had long advocated.
 Constraints under the NSL continued to limit academic freedom, both directly and
 indirectly. There is also a continued threat to academic freedom from leftist stu-
 dents who intimidate professors whose lectures or writings contradict the students'
 ideology.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Law on Assembly and
 Demonstrations prohibits assemblies considered likely to "undermine" public order
 and requires that demonstrations of all types, including political rallies, be reported
 in advance to the police. The Government continued to use these and other restric-
 tive laws to prosecute protest organizers and to block many gatherings organized
 by dissidents and particularly students, arguing that they might incite "social un-
 rest" and therefore be illegal. Police usually tried to prevent student demonstrations
 
 
 598
 from moving off campuses into the streets, and confrontations frequently ensued,
 often involving violence on both sides.
 Nonetheless, police reported that street demonstrations in urban areas dropped
 by three-quarters-during the first half of the year, from 1,155 to 292. Overall, pro-
 tests droppedb tyathird, from 2,889 to 2,057. Arrests by the authorities under the
 Law on Assemb   and Demonstrations also went down.
 c. Freedom  f  ion.-There is no state religion. Pull freedom prevails for pros-
 elytizmg, doctrinal teaching, and conversion. Korea both sends and receives mission-
 aries of various faiths, and many religious groups in Korea maintain active links
 with members of similar faiths in other countries. The Government and the public
 do not discriminate against minority sects. Adherence to a particular faith confers
 neither advantages nor disadvantages in civil, military, or official life.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-There is universal freedom of movement within the country. Foreign
 travel is generally unrestricted, but travel to North Korea is allowed only with gov-
 ernment a prov . One of the conditions is that the trip must not be "political."
 Moon Ik Hwan who was convicted under the NSL for traveling to North Korea in
 1989 without government permission, remained in prison See Section 1.d.). Between
 August 1989 and August 1992, 539 South Koreans in 18 different groups visited
 North Korea, and another 2,247 contacted North Koreans with government ap-
 proval.
 Following a spate of incidents in 1991 in which prosecutors used exit bans to
 apply pressure on U.S. citizens in commercial disputes, the Government issued in
 January new guidelines on the imposition of exit bans on foreigners under the Exit
 and Entry Control Act. The Act gives immigration authorities discretionary powers
 to block the departure of both foreigners and Koreans from Korea. The new guide-
 lines provide procedures when previously there had been none, but still leave a con-
 siderable amount of discretion to the authorities. There were no further reports of
 exit bans involving U.S. citizens. In June, however, the authorities stopped Rev. Cho
 Myung Chul, a Korean citizen with U.S. residence, from leaving Korea because he
 was under investigation for violating the NSL in connection with his involvement
 with a night scho0l for young laborers when Cho lived in Mokpo in the late 1980's.
 Prosecutors lifted Rev. Cho's exit ban at the end of June. In December a Seoul Ap-
 peals Court ruled that the Justice Ministry should not have issued an exit ban
 against a Korean businessman accused of embezzlement because he was unlikely to
 flee the country or destroy evidence.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The Korean people have the right to elect their own government. The Constitu-
 tion, as amended in 1987, provides for the direct election of the President and for
 a mixed system of direct and proportional election of legislators. The President
 serves a single 5-year term and may not be reelected. The National Assembly's term
 is 4 years. There is universal suffrage for all citizens aged 20 or above, and elections
 are held by secret ballot. In March the Constitutional Court gave independent and
 political party candidates equal footing in carrying out campaign activities, ruling
 unconstitutional election law provisions which gave party candidates more latitude
 in organizing public speeches than independents.
 On March 24 Koreans exercised the right to vote during elections for the 14th
 National Assembly, resulting in a slim government majority after a number of inde-
 pendents joined the ruling DLP. Party conventions to nominate presidential can-
 didates were held in the spring.
 On December 18, Koreans elected Kim Young Sam of the Democratic Liberal
 Party as Korea's next president, the first civilian chief executive in nearly three dec-
 ades. The contest was fiercely contested but free of violence. Korea's election laws
 are restrictive, and many Koreans advocate their revision. As a consequence, the
 campaign was marked by disputes over government investigations of campaign
 irregularities. However extensive media coverage of the campaign and all seven of
 the candidates meant tiiat the voters heard the charges and countercharges on cam-
 paign irregularities. Voting and ballot-counting were conducted without allegations
 of irregularities.
 In January Hyundai Corporation founder Chung Ju Yong formed an opposition
 party which then won more seats than expected in the National Assembly elections.
 Dissidents also ran under the People's Party, but failed to win any seats.
 Although the results of the National Assembly elections were generally accepted
 by Koreans there were charges, as in previous years, of campaign and voting irreg-
 ularities. Te most prominent incidents were the apprehension by opposition cam-
 paign workers of four NSP agents stuffing smear letters into mailboxes and revels-
 
 
 599
 tions by some soldiers that officers attempted to or did manipulate absentee voters
 and ballots. The broadcast and print media gave extensive coverage to such inci-
 dents when uncovered. Two of three court-supervised recounts in individual districts
 confirmed the original results. On balance, alleged irregularities did not appear to
 affect the election outcome, and a pattern of strong public reaction and legal action
 against the perpetrators seemed to emerge.
 All the election laws are highly restrictive as to the kinds of activities that are
 permitted, and active participation in campaigning is limited to registered party
 workers. There are also limits on campaign spending and advertising, including pur-
 chase of television time. Nevertheless, the candidates were all well known, appeared
 in numerous campaign rallies as well as television and print interviews, and gave
 televised speeches.
 For reasons of culture and discrimination, women occupy few positions in govern-
 ment and the professions. There are currently 3 women in the 299-seat National As-
 sembly, all of whom were appointed to proportional representation seats based on
 their parties' showing in the 1992 elections.
 All 17 female candidates in the National Assembly district races lost. There are
 two women on the executive committee of the opposition Democratic Party. The Sec-
 ond Minister for Political Affairs is the only woman in the Cabinet. Her portfolio
 is Women's Affairs.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The National Assembly and the major political parties all have committees con-
 cerned with various aspects of human rights. In addition, several nonaffiliated pri-
 vate organizations are active in promoting human rights. These groups publish re-
 ports on the human rights situation in Korea and make their views known both in-
 side and outside the country. In May Lawyers for a Democratic Society and the Na-
 tional Council of Churches in Korea submitted a detailed "Counter Report' to the
 U.N. Human Rights Commission, which held its first review of Korea. Some human
 rights monitors have credibly reported government harassment and surveillance.
 Government and ruling party officials have generally been willing to meet with
 international human rights groups. In 1992 government officials met with delega-
 tions from the Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Human Rights Center and Amnesty
 International. The Government has regularly discussed human rights with foreign
 diplomats.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Language, or Social Status
 The Republic of Korea is a racially homogeneous country with no ethnic minori-
 ties of significant size. Nonetheless, regional rivalries exist. Persons from the south-
 western region (North and South Cholla Provinces) have traditionally faced dis-
 crimination. Many Koreans believe that successive governments led by figures from
 the southeastern region (North and South Kyongsang Provinces) have deliberately
 neglected the economic development of the Cholla provinces for political reasons.
 Centuries of isolation and a history of foreign invasion and occupation engendered
 a past tradition of xenophobia in Korea. Due to legal as well as social discrimina-
 tion, many Chinese residents in Korea emigrated to other countries since the 1970's,
 with the number of Chinese residents decreasing from 40,000 to 18,000 over the
 past several years. Discrimination also occurs against Amerasian children as well
 as against foreign workers, most of whom come from China, the Philippines, Ban-
 gladesh, Nepal, and Pakistan to work, often illegally.
 As Korea continues to develop economically, socially, and politically, Korean com-
 munity and social organizations have started to focus attention on the issue of the
 rights and treatment of handicapped and_ mentally ill or retarded people. Although
 there are public displays of oncern for the mentally and p hysically disabled, such
 as the Special Olympics and television documentaries, public facilities for their ev-
 eryday care and use remained inadequate and their general treatment by society
 discriminatory.
 Korea's conservative Confucian tradition has left women subordinate to men so-
 cially, economically, and legally. Some progress has been made since the founding
 of the Republic. Women may and do vote, become government officials, hold elected
 office, and enjoy full access to educational opportunities. Nonetheless, the vestiges
 of Confucian traditions remain in many areas. Most married women do not work
 outside the home. In large companies, women are often expected to resign upon
 marriage or no later than the birth of their first child. Judicial decisions in cases
 involving women petitioners or defendants were often heavily influenced by the Ko-
 rean Confucian ethos, which does not accord women equal status with men.
 
 
 The National Assembly enacted an Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) law in
 1988 and, in early 1991, the Government issued 'Guidelines to Eliminate Sexual
 Discrimination in Employment." So far, however, the law and guidelines have had
 only limited practical effect. There are very few women who work as company execu-
 tives, officials in government ministries, lawyers, or university professors in a num-
 ber of disciplines. Women accounted for Pat over 40 percent of the economically ac-
 tive population. The average female worker's wage remained a little over half that
 of the average male worker.
 Starting wages for female university graduates were 40 percent less than those
 of their male counterparts. The traditional preference for male children continues
 in Korea today. It is estimated that when today's children reach marrying age there
 will be 400,000 "surplus bachelors." Korean law bans sex testing and abortions ex-
 cept when the woman's life is in danger, a hereditary disease would be passed along,
 or in case of rape or incest. Fetal sex testing and abortion of female fetuses, how-
 ever, are still widely performed.
 Korea's amended Family Law, which went into effect in January 1991, permits
 women to head a household, recognizes a wife's right to a portion of the couple's
 property, and allows a woman to maintain greater contact with her offspring after
 a divorce. The effect of the revised law on actual practice is still unknown. For in-
 stance, although discrimination in the distribution of inherited property has been
 legally abolished, it continued to be widespread in practice.
 Although the revised Family Law contains no express provisions regarding wife
 abuse, it provides legal protections for women in terms of custody of their children
 and division of the property if they decide to file for divorce. Before the amended
 Family Law went into effect, a woman who filed for divorce, even if it was based
 on charges of physical or mental abuse, automatically lost custody of her children
 and ha very limited property rights. Although the revisions gave abused women
 a more credible option, divorce still remains a social taboo. Most Koreans were un-
 aware of the revised law and there is little government or private assistance for
 divorced women. These factors, plus the fact that employment opportunities for
 women are limited and that divorced women have difficulty remarrying, leads some
 women to stay in abusive situations.
 There are no reliable statistics on the incidence of wife abuse, but qualified ob-
 servers, including women's rights groups, believe it is widespread.
 In the first quarter of 1992, 759 cases of rape were reported to the police, an in-
 crease of mere than 10 percent over the same period in 1991. The ruling and main
 opposition parties proposed stronger bills against rape, with the opposition party's
 bill permitting judges to sentence rapists to death.
 Following strong protests by women's group the Justice Ministry withdrew a
 proposal to abolish a 1953 law which makes adultery a criminal offense, but pro-
 posed instead to reduce the maximum prison sentence from 2 years to 1. The Min-
 istry also proposed to abolish a law which made it a crime for men to strike up a
 sexual relationship by falsely promising to marry a woman.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Associaton.-The Constitution gives workers, with the exception
 of most public service employees and teachers, the right to free association. There
 are however, public sector unions in railways, telecommunications, postal workers,
 and the national medical center. The Trade Union Law specifies that only one union
 is permitted at each place of work, and all unions are required to register with the
 authorities when formed and dissolved. The Government refuses to recognize labor
 federations which are not part of or affiliated with the country's two legally recog-
 nized labor groupings--the Federation of Korean Trade Unions (FKTU) and the
 independent Korean Federation of Clerical and Financial Workers. However, in an
 important victory for independent labor federations, the Seoul High Court ruled in
 July that the Federation of Hospital Unions is a legitimate labor federation. A fur-
 ther major advance occurred in December when the Supreme Court ruled for the
 first time that the Labor Ministry must recognize the independent Korean Federa-
 tion of Press Unions as legal, and that affiliation to the FKTU is not required in
 order to be registered as a legal labor federation.
 There is no minimum number of members required to form a union, and unions
 may be formed without a vote of the full, prospective membership. Korea's election
 and labor laws forbid unions from donating money to political parties or participat-
 ing in election campaigns. Trade unionists, however, circumvent the ban by tempo-
 rarily resigning their union posts and running as part of a political party or as an
 independent.
 Strikes are prohibited in government agencies, state-run enterprises, and defense
 industries. By law, enterprises in public interest sectors such as public transpor-
 
 
 601
 tation, utilities, public health, banking, broadcasting, and communications must
 submit to government-ordered arbitration in lieu of striking. The Labor Dispute Ad-
 justment Act requires unions to notify the Ministry of Labor of their intention to
 strike and mandates a 10-day cooling-off period' before a strike may legally begin.
 (This period is 15 days in public interest sectors.)
 Overall membership in Korean labor unions has been declining over the last sev-
 eral years. This decline is a result of a combination of factors, including public con-
 cern over the erosion of Korea's international competitivenea, disaffection with
 confrontational, often violent, union tactics, and the Government's repression of dis-
 sident unions and insistence that labor actions remain within the bounds of the
 highly restrictive labor laws.
 The FKTU is affiliated with the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions
 (ICFTU). Moat of the FKTU's 20 constituent federations maintain affiliations with
 international trade secretariats.
 The Government continued its hard-line stand against labor centers it calls "radi-
 cal organizations * including Clonnohyop (Korea Trade Union Congress, or KTUC)
 and the Korean Congress ofIndependent Industrial Federations (KCIIF). The mem-
 bership of Chonnohyop, founded in 1990 as an alternative labor center but not le-
 gally registered, reportedly continued to drop from 166,000 workers in January 1990
 to about 6.0,000 in 1992.
 Five members of the banned teachers union Chonkyojo, arrested after a protest
 demonstration in March, charged they were beaten by police while in custody. In
 late April, the Constitutional Court again upheld the Government's ban against
 ChonkyoJo when it ruled that Article 66 of the Government Employees Act, which
 bars public servants from engang in union activities, is constitutional. In August
 a Seoul high school, reportedy under  pressure from the authorities, reversed its de-
 cision to reinstate two teachers fired in 1989 for refusing to quit Chonkyojo. In the
 summer, 11 leaders, all teachers, of the "Pan-National Committee for Educational
 Reforms and Reinstatement of Dismissed Teachers," an organization supporting the
 1,400 fired teachers, were themselves fired. International teachers federations and
 a coalition of Korean dissident unions lodged a worker rights complaint with the
 International Labor Organization (ILO) in April, which continued to be under exam-
 ination by the ILO at year's end.
 Reports of police intervention in labor disputes declined in 1992 from the previous
 year, reflecting the low number of strikes during the year's spring wage round.
 Moreover, there were no credible reports of employer-hired goon squads assaulting
 workers in 1992.
 Since July 1991 South Korea has been suspended from U.S. Overseas Private In-
 vestment Corporation (O.P.I.C.) insurance programs because there has been no sig-
 nificant progress in worker rights.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The Constitution and the
 Trade Union Law guarantee the autonomous right of workers to enjoy collective bar-
 gaining and collective action. Although the Trade Union Law is ambiguous, the au-
 thorities have ruled that union members cannot reject collective bargainingagree-
 ments signed by management and labor negotiators. This situation has in the past
 led to repudiation of contracts and wildcat strikes. Extensive collective bargaining
 is practiced. Korea's labor laws do not extend the right to bargain collectively to gov-
 ernment employees including employees of state or public-run enterprises, and de-
 fense industries. Companies operating in Korea's two export processing zones
 (EPZ's) have been considered public-interest enterprises whose employees' nghts to
 organize and bargain ollectively face restrictions. In practice, however, unions at
 EPZ companies have been formed and workers in the two EPZ's exercise the right
 to organize and bargain collectively like other private sector unions.
 Korea has no independent system of labor courts. The central and local labor com-
 mittees form a semia"utonomous ageny of the Ministry of Labor that adjudicates
 disputes in accordance with the Labor Dispute Adjustment Law. Each labor commit-
 tee is composed of equal representation from labor (represented by the FKTU), man-
 agement, and "the public interest.' Local labor committees are empowered to decide
 on remedial measures in cases involving unfair labor practices and to mediate and
 arbitrate labor disputes.
 The Trade Union Law and Labor Dispute Adjustment Law forbid third-party
 intervention in unions and labor disputes by federations not recognized by the Gov-
 ernment, such as Chonnohyop and KCHIF, but allow recognized labor federations,
 principally the FKTU and its affiliates, to assist affiliated unions. The ban on third-
 party intervention also exempts mediation efforts by lawyers, experts, and others
 who have the consent of both labor and management. The Government continued
 to enforce strictly the laws against third-party intervention. In June authorities is-
 sued an arrest warrant against Yang Gum Mo, president of the KCIIF-affiliated
 
 
 Hospital Workers Federation, for violating the third-party ban. Mutual manage-
 ment-labor antagonism remains a serious problem, and many major employers re-
 main strongly antiunion.
 In January the press reported that Hyundai Motor Company security guards tried
 to take into custody a female labor activist who was teachuig labor movement songs
 to workers. In 1992, as in the past, there were cases of violence against manage-
 ment officials and company prorrty by workers. In January Hyundai Motor union
 members striking over year-en bonuses, wielded metal pipes and threw steel nuts,
 bolts, and other objects when executives and other nonunion members tried to enter
 the Ulsan complex, reportedly injuring 10 People.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Constitution provides that no
 person shall be punished, placed under preventive restrictions, or subjected to invol-
 untary labor, except as provided by law and through lawful procedures. Forced or
 compulsory labor is not condoned by the Government.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-IThe Labor Standards Law pro.
 hibits the employment of persons under the age of 13 without a special employment
 certificate from the Ministry of Labor. Because there is compulsory education until
 the age of 13, few special employment certificates are issued for full-time employ-
 ment. Some children are allowed to do part-time jobs such as selling newspaers.
 In order to gain employment, children under 18 must have written approval from
 their parents or guardians. Employers may require minors to work only a reduced
 number of overtime hours and are prohibited from employing them at night without
 special permission from the Ministry of Labor.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-Korea implemented a minimum wage law in
 1988. The minimum wage level is reviewed annually. Companies with fewer than
 10 employees are exempt from this law, and some still pay below-minimum wages.
 Due to Korea's tight labor market, however, most firms pay wages well above the
 minimum wage in order to attract and retain workers. The FKT  and other unions
 continued to claim that the current minimum wage does not meet the minimum re-
 quirements of urban workers. The Government notes that the money an average Ko-
 rean blue-collar worker takes home in overtime and bonuses significantly raises the
 total compensation package. According to the Ministry of Health and Social Affairs,
 5.2 percent of the population lived below the poverty level in 1992.
 The Labor Standards and Industrial Safety and Health laws provide for a maxi-
 mum 56-hour workweek. Amendments to the Labor Standards Law passed in March
 1989 brought the maximum regular workweek down to 44 hours. According to the
 Ministry of Labor, the average Korean worker worked 47.8 hours per week, includ-
 ing overtime, in 1991.
 The Government sets health and safety standards, but South Korea suffers from
 unusually high accident rates. The Ministry of Labor employs few inspectors, and
 its standards are not effectively enforced. Although the number of workers who suf-
 fered industrial accidents or occupational diseases decreased in 1991, the number
 of seriously injured or killed workers increased. The Labor Ministry reported that
 2,299 workers died in industrial accidents, an increase of 2.8 percent over 1990, and
 29,854 were maimed, a 7.3 percent increase over 1990. The Labor Ministry at-
 tributes these problems to a focus on rapid, export-based industrialization, worn out
 or old equipment, increased use of hazardous chemicals, lack of research and man-
 power, and, in the case of construction, firms in a manpower-short sector employing
 unskilled workers without proper training. The industrial safety and health law
 does not guarantee that workers who remove themselves from dangerous work envi-
 ronments would not jeopardize their continued employment.
