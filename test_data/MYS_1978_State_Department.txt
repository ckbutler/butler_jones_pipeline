 MALAYSIA
 Malaysia is governed under a parliamentary system model-
 ed along British lines. A national front coalition of
 parties now dominates Parliament. A small but vocal
 opposition criticizes the Government frequently.
 Elections are held at intervals of no longer than five
 years; they are basically free and honest. Malaysia
 has a multi-racial society in which Malays dominate poli-
 tical affairs while Chinese, and to a lesser extent
 Indians, play the leading roles in the economy.
 Malaysia has experienced severe communal violence, most
 recently following the May 1969 elections when several
 hundred persons were reported to have died in race riots
 in Kuala Lumpur. The Communist Party of Malaya (CPM) has
 been engaged in an "armed struggle" with the Government
 since 1948. More than three thousand CPM guerrillas are
 based in sanctuaries in southern Thailand. Their efforts
 against the Malaysian Government now amount to a few
 assassinations and acts of terrorism per year, as well as
 ongoing jungle warfare resulting in scores of Malaysian
 police or military killed or wounded annually. This sit-
 uation and the possibility of renewed communal conflict
 are cited by the Malaysian Government as justification
 for legislation which makes legal the arrest and detention
 without trial of persons suspected of subversive activity
 or of other activities that threaten general civic order.
 In the twenty years since gaining independence, and
 despite the demands posed by the communist insurgency,
 Malaysia has made major progress in economic and social
 development. It is one of the most prosperous developing
 countries in Asia with an averdge per capita Gross National
 Product (GNP) of $988 in 1977.
 1'.  Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 There is no evidence that torture is either practiced or
 condoned by the Government of Malaysia, although indivi-
 
 (385)
 
 
 386
 dual instances of mistreatment by civil law enforcement
 officers occasionally occur. Such behavior is punish-
 able. Four policemen were recently sentenced to jail
 for causing the death of a suspect during interrogation.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment is neither autho-
 rized nor condoned by the Government of Malaysia, but
 individual instances of mistreatment by civil law
 enforcement officers occasionally occur. Persons
 detained without trial are sometimes held in solitary
 confinement.
 c. Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 The Malaysian Constitution provides for the proclamation
 of a State of Emergency during which individual rights
 can be limited by law. A State of Emergency has existed
 since it was proclaimed in May'1969 during communal
 rioting.   Legislation granting extraordinary powers to
 the Government enable arrest and imprisonment without
 benefit of trial or the right of habeas corpus.
 The CPM threat and racial tensions -ave been cited by
 the Government as justification for the perpetuation
 and use of emergency powers which were first embodied
 in regulations by the British but later extended and
 made more comprehensive by Malaysian legislation.
 These regulations permit arrest and detention without
 open trial of persons suspected of subversive activity
 or other actions contributing to domestic instability.
 Known as the Internal Security Act (ISA) and the
 Emergency (Public Order and Prevention of Crime)
 Ordinance, 1969, (E.O.), they provide for initial
 preventive detention for up to two years. A person
 detained under the emergency laws has no recourse to
 the courts in the ordinary sense, but as soon as
 possible after arrest must be told the reason and
 given an opportunity to challenge the detention order.
 Under the ISA, challenges to detention must be heard
 within three months by a three-man advisory board.
 If the detention is upheld, the case is periodically
 reviewed by the Appeals Board and the detention order
 may then be renewed. It is the Department of State's
 
 
 387
 impression that relatively few detention orders are
 renewed beyond one year. The use of the Internal
 Security Act appears to follow a cycle of arrest,
 detention, recantation and release.
 The present Emergency Ordinance, while enacted in the
 wake of the May 1969 racial disturbances, has since
 then been most often used against narcotics traffickers
 and other serious criminals in the absence of effective
 laws against conspiracy. The E.O., which makes no
 provision for renewal, provides that after two years
 imprisonment, a period of two years of "restricted
 residence" in a remote area of the country may be order-
 ed.
 In addition to the ISA and E.O., the Government also
 makes use of the Emergency (Essential Powers) Ordinance
 of 1969, which provides the basis for regulations that
 seriously impair the rights of the accused in security
 cases by allowing an in camera trial, anonymous witness-
 es and a presumption 367 guit.
 The Amnesty International Report of 1977 stated that
 several hundred men and women were being held without
 trial for political reasons, many having been held for
 periods of eight and, in some cases, thirteen years.
 While several hundred people are known to be detained
 without trial under the three emergency statutes, other
 observers believe that the majority are held on security
 and criminal, as contrasted to purely political, grounds.
 The Malaysian Government announced in Parliament in
 November 1978 that 89 long-term detainees were being held
 without trial under the ISA. Of the 89, 25 had been held
 for five or six years, 34 for seven or eight years, 21 for
 nine or ten years, and 18 for ten to 13 years.
 d. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Modeled on the British judiciary, the Malaysian courts
 are generally regarded by the public and the legal
 community as committed to the rule of law and not
 susceptible to pressure from the Executive. Defendents
 have the right to counsel and lawyers are able to repre-
 sent dissidents without penalty to themselves. Most
 civil and criminal cases are tried under this judicial
 system and thus public trial and a fair hearing occur
 
 
 388
 in all but a small minority of cases.- As noted above,
 however, persons detained for security reasons and
 certain classes of crimes are held and given hearings
 under special procedures outside the ordinary court
 system.  (See Section lc)
 e. Invasion of the Home
 Invasion of the home is generally limited to cases
 involving security legislation. In its counter-insur-
 gency effort against the CPM, the Government makes
 extensive use of its powers under the Internal Security
 Act to enter and search the homes of suspects.
 2.   Governmental Policies Relating to the Fulfillment
 of Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care
 and Education
 Despite the communist insurgency, Malaysia has made
 significant economic advances in the twenty years
 since gaining independence and is now one of the most
 prosperous of the developing countries in East Asia
 (with a per capita GNP of $988 in 1977). The multi-
 ethnic coalition Government has demonstrated its concern
 for raising the standard of living of all citizens and
 has made the alleviation of rural poverty the primary
 goal of its domestic policy. The Third Malaysia Plan
 announced in mid-1976 logically follows earlier develop-
 mental efforts which concentrated on the broadening of
 essential services and industrial infrastructure.
 Among current programs are rural development initiatives,
 extensive government scholarships for children of the
 poor and programs to improve health care, education,
 housing and rural nutrition.
 Corruption is still a problem, although the Government
 has continued a vigorous drive against it. It recently
 jailed a prominent Malay political figure and is bringing
 several other officials to trial. Corruption has been
 reduced as a result of such prosecutions and other
 campaigns to reform the bureaucracy.
 3.   Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Includ-
 ing:
 a. Freedom of Thought, Speech, Press, Religion
 and Assembly
 
 
 389
 Tensions between ethnic Malay and Chinese citizens led
 to race riots in 1969 and the suspension of parliament-
 ary democracy for two years. Since then, certain
 "sensitive" topics touching on ethnic origins or
 privileges may not be discussed in public or in the
 Parliament. The State of Emergency legally proclaimed
 during the 1969 communal rioting continues in effect.
 The Emergency Laws are designed to reduce the risk of
 communal violence by forbidding any public exacerbation
 of racial tensions.
 While radio and television are government-controlled,
 the press is not. The press is constrained by the
 consitutional prohibitions against discussion of certain
 ethnically sensitive topics and, mindful of the need
 for annual renewal of publishing licenses, is circum-
 spect in its treatment of the Government. However,
 there are no other restrictions on what may be printed,
 and the activities and statements of opposition poli-
 tical figures and domestic political developments are
 covered. Moreover, the press reports on violations of
 legal standards and acts as an informal ombudsman, as
 do the parliamentary opposition and the active bar asso-
 ciation.
 The position of women in Malaysian society is relatively
 unrestricted within the constraints of Islam and other
 Eastern cultures of the country. Women have full voting
 rights and enjoy legal rights to equal economic oppor-
 tunity, although social custom limits both in practice.
 The Government practices affirmative action on an exten-
 sive scale in favor of the politically dominant ethnic
 Malays. Non-Malays consider this policy discriminatory.
 Non-Malays are also denied equal opportunities for
 education, government employment, and participation in
 selected economic activities. This latter practice is
 based both on constitutional provisions and governmental
 policies. However, most Malays, as a result of the
 social and economic system until recently prevailing in
 the country, had been excluded from most areas of econo-
 mic activity in the modern sector. The goal of government-
 supported affirmative action programs is to modify this
 pattern of ethnic economic discrimination while pursuing
 a successful economic development program and thereby
 eventually providing increased opportunities for all
 Malaysians.
 
 
 390
 While Malaysia is officially Muslim, the Government
 does not discriminate against other religious faiths.
 The Malaysian Government permits some trade union acti-
 vity although labor legislation circumscribes union
 behavior. There are about 350 trade unions with a total
 of about 500,000 members. Most of the unions are
 members of the Malaysian Trade Union Congress, an
 active member of the International Confederation of
 Free Trade Unions. Except when vital public services
 are involved, the freedom to strike exists and is used.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel and Emigration
 The Government generally permits free domestic and
 foreign travel, including emigration. Persons wishing
 to travel abroad must obtain passports, and these have
 been denied in a few cases. Freedom to travel between
 Peninsular Malaysia and the Borneo states of Sabah and
 Sarawak is constitutionally subject to control by the
 federal and state Governments. During the recent general
 election, the Sabah and Sarawak state Governments arbi-
 trarily denied entry to several opposition politicians
 from Peninsular Malaysia.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Malaysia is a parliamentary democracy generally on the
 British model, with a Prime Minister and Cabinet respon-
 sible to Parliament. The Head of State is a constitu-
 tional monarch elected for a five-year term by the
 Sultans of West Malaysia from among their own members.
 The bicameral Parliament consists of a Senate (with both
 appointed and elected members) and an elected House of
 Representatives, where a small but vocal opposition
 criticizes the Government regularly. Legislative power
 is further divided between federal and state legislatures.
 State executive administrations attend to matters of
 local concern. Elections on the basis of universal
 adult suffrage are held as specified by the Constitution.
 The national parliamentary elections held in July 1978
 were basically free. While the ruling party took full
 advantage of its incumbency and for security reasons
 forbade public rallies (which inhibited the opposition)
 even the opposition conceded that votes were cast freely
 
 
 391
 and secretly and were recorded accurately. The success
 of one major opposition party, which doubled its repre-
 sentation in Parliament, coupled with the defeat of
 another, demonstrated that the election was conducted
 without distorting governmental interference and reflect-
 ed the electorate's desires. Domestic political life
 while vigorous is constrained by prohibitions against
 public expression which could increase communal
 tension.
 4.   Government Attitude and Record Regarding Inter-
 national and Non-Governmental Investigation of
 Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Amnesty International has repeatedly called for the
 release of individuals detained without trial. An
 Amnesty International mission arrived in Malaysia in
 November to inquire into the human rights situation.
 Its findings have not been released as of the end of
 1978.
