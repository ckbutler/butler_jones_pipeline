 DJIBOUTI
 President Hassan Gouled Aptidon and the People's Rally for Progress (RPP), in
 power since independence in 1977, continue to rule the country, despite 1992 con-
 stitutional changes that permitted the creation of opposition political parties. Two
 main ethnic groups hold most political power: Somali Issas (the tribe of the Presi-
 dent), and Afars. Citizens from other Somali clans (Issak, Gadabursi, and Darod),
 and those of Yemeni and other origins, are limited unofficially in their access to top
 government positions. In 1994 the Government and a faction of the Mar-led Front
 or the Restoration of Unity and Democracy (FRUD) signed a peace accord, ending
 3 years of civil war. In the accord, the Government agreed to recognize the FRUD
 as a legitimate political party. The Government named two FRUD leaders to cabinet
 positions in 1995; however, part of the FRUD rejected the peace accord and remains
 opposed to the Government. Two other legal political parties have existed since
 1992, the National Democratic Party (PND) and the Party for Democratic Renewal
 (PRD); neither holds a parliamentary seat or a cabinet level post. In 1997 the ruling
 
 
 party coalition that includes the FRUD party won all 65 seats in legislative elec-
 tions, which took place without international observers and amid opposition claims
 of massive fraud. Presidential elections are scheduled for April 1999. The judiciary
 is not independent of the executive.
 The 8,000-member National Police Force (FNP) is responsible for internal security
 and border control, and is overseen by the Ministry of Interior. The Ministry of De-,
 fense controls the army. The Gendarmerie Nationale, a police force responsible for
 the President's security, which previously had reported to the Ministry of Defense,
 is an autonomous unit under the Presidency. A small intelligence bureau also re-
 ports directly to the President. Civilian authorities generally maintain effective con-
 trol of the security forces, but there were instances in which the security forces
 acted independently of the Government's authority. Some members of the security
 forces committed human rights abuses.
 Djibouti has little industry and few natural resources. Services provide most of
 the national income. Minor mineral deposits remain mostly unexploited. Only a
 tenth of the land is arable and only 1 percent is forested. Outside the capital city,
 the primary economic activity is nomadic subsistence. Citizens are free to pursue
 private business interests and to hold personal and real property. The part of the
 annual gross domestic product not generated by and for the foreign community,
 which includes some 8,000 French citizens, is estimated at no more than $250
 (41750 DF) per capita annually.
 The Government's human rights record continued to be poor. Citizens have not
 yet been allowed to exercise the right to change their government; despite
 multiparty elections, there has been no change in government since independence
 in 1977. Members of the security forces committed at least one extrajudicial killing.
 There were credible reports that some members of the security forces beat and oth-
 erwise abused, and at times tortured, detainees and sexually assaulted female in-
 mates. There were credible reports that soldiers raped women in rural districts.
 Prison conditions are harsh. The Government continued to harass, intimidate, and
 imprison political opponents and union leaders and to arrest and detain persons ar-
 bitrarily. It also infringed on citizens' privacy rights. The Government at times re-
 stricted freedom of speech and of the press. Police occasionally jailed or intimidated
 journalists. The Government limited freedom of assembly, and restricted freedom of
 association. The Government discourages proselytizing. There were some limits on
 freedom of movement. Discrimination against women persists, and the practice of
 female genital mutilation (FGM) continued to be widespread. Discrimination on the
 basis of ethnic background persists. The Government imposed some limits on unions
 and their leaders, and there were reports of instances of forced labor.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.--On October 3, gendarmes killed one
 man and injured another in downtown Djibouti when they shot into a crowd while
 attempting to make an arrest. Instead of aiding the victims, the gendarmes fled,
 and later claimed that they shot in self-defense. The gendarmerie successfully pre-
 vented a police investigation into the incident. On November 18 near Assa Gueyla,
 soldiers killed two Afar community elders, Anfare Adahis Ibrahim and Youssouf
 Derkala Adabo, reportedly in retaliation for a land mine explosion that killed five
 soldiers and injured nine others on November 16. In December relatives of the vic-
 tims filed legal complaints against three officers stationed in Tadjoura District. The
 case was still pending at year's end.
 Several prisoners reportedly died due to a lack of adequate medical care and
 harsh prison conditions. In May a prisoner died during a hunger strike in protest
 of prison conditions (see Section 1.c.).
 There continued to be sporadic reports of fighting involving the army and FRUD
 rebels that resulted in a number of deaths. Two land mine explosions near refugee
 camps in the Ali Sabieh district in March killed three soldiers and a government
 refugee agency driver, and injured several dozen Ethiopian refugees. Ten men be-
 lieved to have ties with FRUD rebels were arrested in connection with the explo-
 sions. In October unknown persons attacked an Ethiopian truck envoy. One driver
 was killed and the others were detained for several hours before being released. The
 Government blamed the incident on FRUD rebels. In November a land mine explo-
 sion killed five soldiers and wounded nine others near Assa Gueyla. There were no
 developments in the legal proceedings against six soldiers accused in the 1995
 killings of Randa's religious leader, Ali Houmed Souleh, the brother of the leader
 of the Association for the Defense of Human Rights and Liberties (ADDHL) (see
 Section 4), and an associate, Said Aramis. Two of the six soldiers detained were re-
 
 
 leased early in the year and the other four remain imprisoned. Their case has not
 yet been brought to trial. The Ministry of Justice blamed the failure to bring the
 cases to closure in an expeditious manner on a lack of qualified personnel.
 There has been no investigation into the 1997 police killing of Hassan Aden
 Farah, who was shot following a car chase. Police claimed that Farah was plotting
 to kill a high-level official.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 There were no developments in the 1995 abduction of four persons by armed men
 in the north, or in the 1995 kidnaping of a traditional Afar chief at Alalli Aada.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution provides that no one shall be subjected to torture or to other inhu-
 man, cruel, degrading, or humiliating punishments, and torture is punishable by 15
 years' imprisonment; however, there were credible reports that police and gen-
 darmes routinely beat and otherwise physically abused, and at times tortured, pris-
 oners and detainees. In a September court hearing, military officers detained on
 "disobedience" charges in connection with an alleged coup plot publicly declared that
 they had been subjected to torture while held by gendarmerie. Some soldiers said
 that they had been forced to relieve themselves while clothed and handcuffed. One
 soldier reported being forced to sleep in a cell with so much water on the floor that
 he would have drowned if he had slept lying down. There were reports that two gov-
 ernment health care workers arrested during a strike were hospitalized as a result
 of being tortured by police while in detention in March (see Section 6.a.).
 In November while breaking up a rally in support of PND leader, Aden Robleh,
 police beat Robleh's wife and son (see Sections 1.d. and 2.b.). The son was treated
 for facial paralysis resulting from the beating. There were no reports that any secu-
 rity personnel were punished for such abuses.
 In December the police used tear gas to disrupt a protest by several hundred high
 school students and reportedly beat some of the students (see Section 2.b.).
 There were credible reports that security force personnel raped at least 120 Afar
 women in recent years in the northern districts of Obock and Tadjoura (see Section
 5). In almost all cases the victims did not press charges due to shame and fear. In
 some cases, the women's husbands were afraid of losing their jobs and therefore did
 not speak out. A women's rights activist reported that she knew of only two convic-
 tions of soldiers for rape, and neither served any of their 18-month sentences in
 prison.
 Prison conditions are harsh and prisons are severely overcrowded. Gabode prison,
 built for 350 persons, at times housed nearly twice that number. Overcrowded condi-
 tions and lack of sufficient food and medical care led to a hunger strike in late May
 and early June, followed by rioting in late July and early August. One prisoner died
 as a result of malnutrition during the hunger strike. Several prisoners died at
 Gabode prison, reportedly due to a lack of adequate medical care and harsh condi-
 tions. To address this problem, the Government reopened Obock prison in December
 and transferred 120 prisoners. The Government sometimes shortens prison terms to
 reduce overcrowding. The Ministry of Justice estimates that 60 percent of prisoners
 are illegal Ethiopian immigrants who have committed crimes in Djibouti. Children
 under the age of 5 of female inmates sometimes are allowed to stay with their moth-
 ers; authorities say that milk is provided for them. Prisoners reportedly must pay
 authorities to obtain food. Health care sources reported that prison guards raped fe-
 male inmates. Medical care is inadequate, and the prison infirmary lacks sufficient
 medicine. There are no educational or rehabilitation facilities within the prison.
 Ministry of Justice officials said that lack of funding hampers their ability to pro-
 vide even minimal services. In principle, juveniles are housed separately from adult
 prisoners; however, in practice, this is not always the case.
 Conditions at Nagad detention center, where Ethiopians are held prior to deporta-
 tion, are also extremely harsh. Detainees at Nagad are held in unsanitary condi-
 tions and often are not fed for several days before their deportation.
 The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) continues to maintain an
 office in Djibouti, and an ICRC delegate from Kenya made quarterly visits to the
 main prison, providing some medicines, a generator, and kitchen equipment. The
 ICRC also visited the reopened prison in Obock.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Despite legal protections, arbitrary arrest
 and detention are problems. The 1995 Penal Code stipulates that the State may not
 detain a person beyond 48 hours without an examining magistrate's formal charge.
 Detainees may be held another 24 hours with the prior approval of the public pros-
 ecutor. All persons, including those accused of political or national security offenses,
 must be tried within 8 months of arraignment. Nevertheless, the police often dis-
 regarded these procedures, typically arresting persons without warrants (see Section
 
 
 123
 1.f.), and sometimes detaining them for lengthy periods without charge. The Penal
 Code provides for bail and expeditious trial. Incommunicado detention is used.
 More than 100 government health care workers who went on strike in March
 were detained by the police for 2 days (see Section 6.a.). There were reports that
 the police tortured some of them (see Section 1.c.).
 In November police detained approximately 100 persons for several hours for
 holding a rally in support of PND leader Aden Robleh. Robleh also was detained
 and claims that prior to his detention police beat his wife and son (see Section 1.c.).
 In February authorities arrested three opposition leaders of the United Front of
 the Djiboutian Opposition (FUOD) after their newsletter published an article calling
 the Finance Minister a crook. They were released a week later after payin an un-
 specified fine (see Section 2.a.). In May the Government detained Xbdillahi
 Hamareiteh, head of the PRD, after his newsletter criticized a government business
 deal. The prosecutor released him 1 week later for lack of evidence (see Section 2.ai.
 Omar Ahmed Vincent and Aboubaker Ahmed Aouled, editors of the Group for De-
 mocracy and the Republic (GDR) newsletter Populaire, were arrested in May for re-
 printing an article from the legal PRD's newsletter asserting that the Finance Min-
 ister had misappropriated funds while at his prvious post as head of the govern-
 ment pension agency (see Section 2.a.). Legal PRD head Abdillahi Hamareiteh, was
 imprisoned for 10 days in May for an article published in his party's newspaper (see
 Section 2.a.).
 Awaleh Guelleh, who was being held along with two other alleged terrorists for
 the 1990 bombing of a Djiboutian cafe, escaped from Gabode prison in 1997. The
 Government's investigation of the 1990 attack was ongoing at year's end.
 Aicha Dabaleh, who, along with her husband Mohamed Kadami and three FRUD
 rebels, was returned by Ethiopia and imprisoned in 1997, was released from custody
 in December, 1997 and permitted to leave the country in March (see Section 2.d.).
 Her supporters claimed that she was involved only in humanitarian work and
 should not have been returned forcibly. In the weeks prior to her departure,
 Dabaleh, who was 8-months' pregnant at the time, was subjected to telephone death
 threats, had her car tires slashed, and was called a "terrorist" in the ruling party
 newsletter.
 The Government does not use forced exile.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution provides for an independent judi-
 ciary; however, in practice the judiciary is not independent of the executive. Con-
 stitutional provisions for a fair trial are not respected universally, even in nonpoliti-
 cal cases, because of interference from the exedutive branch. Since ministerial
 changes in December 1997, the Justice Minister is officially responsible for human
 rights.
 The judiciary, based on the French Napoleonic Code, comprises a lower court, ap-
 peals courts, and a Supreme Court. There are no longer "special courts" to try cases
 outside normal judiciary channels. The Supreme Court can overrule decisions of the
 lower courts. Magistrates are appointed for life terms. A Constitutional Council
 rules on the constitutionality of laws, including those related to the protection of
 human rights and civil liberties. However, its rulings are not always respected. For
 example, in 1996 the Constitutional Council ruled that the Parliament's disciplinary
 committee had denied wrongly the parliamentary immunity of three legislators (also
 see Section l.a.). No action was taken on the ruling. In 1997, three of the Constitu-
 tional Council's six members were dismissed, though they had not completed their
 term.
 On September 5, former ministers and legislators Moumin Bahdon Farah and
 Ahmed Boulaleh Barreh "Gabayow", were accused in court of inciting disobedience
 in the military with the aim of seizing power. However, they were never imprisoned
 on these charges. The two former ministers, along with three other former senior
 officials, had been detained for 6 months and prohibited from seeking office for 5
 years after they had publicly stated in 1996 that President Gouled ruled by terror.
 In late August, the Government detained 15 soldiers and 1 retired gendarme who
 were accused of working with Moumin and Gabayow. On September 12, in a public
 trial, a judge gave Moumin and Gabayow 1 year suspended sentences, and fined
 them each $5,650 (1 million DF). The 15 soldiers were given 3 to 8 months' sus-
 p ended sentences and required to pay fines varying from $565 (100,000 DF) to
 2,825 (500,000 DF). Charges were dropped against the retired gendarme. Local ob-
 servers commented that given the gravity of the charges, the suspended sentences
 appeared to indicate that there was no concrete evidence. The defendants appealed
 the convictions, but the appeals were still pending at year's end.
 Moumin and Gabayow's French attorney Roger-Vincent Calatayud was denied a
 Djiboutian visa in September when the Ministry of Justice alleged that his past be-
 havior before Djiboutian courts was negative. As a result, the Djiboutian Bar Asso-
 
 
 124
 ciation named a local French attorney to represent Moumin and Gabayow. At the
 September 12 court hearing, this attorney also was named to represent the 15 sol-
 diers and the retired gendarme, who had not had legal representation since being
 detained in late August.
 In 1997 the Djiboutian Bar Association disbarred attorneys Djama Amareh
 Meidal and Aref Mohamed Aref. Meidal was president of the Constitutional Council
 in 1996 when the Council ruled that a Parliamentary committee has acted improp-
 erly in removing the immunity of three legislators. Aref-had been a defense attorney
 in 1996 for the five politicians jailed for criticizing President Gouled. Other mem-
 bers of the legal profession asserted that despite their commendable human rights
 work, the two lawyers had acted unethically in other cases. The two attorneys re-
 main disbarred.
 The legal system is composed of legislation and executive decrees, French codified
 law adopted at independence, Shari'a law, and nomadic traditions. Urban crime is
 dealt with in accordance with French-inspired law and judicial practice in the regu-
 lar courts. Civil actions may be brought in regular or traditional courts. Shari'a law
 is restricted to civil and family matters. The Ministry of Justice continued efforts
 to combine the three types of law in a new text designed to promote women's rights
 and provide greater protection of children, but no progress had been made by year's
 end.
 Traditional law (Xeer) often is used in conflict resolution and victim compensa-
 tion. This traditional law stipulates that, for example, a blood price be paid to the
 victim's clan for crimes such as murder and rape.
 'The Constitution states that the accused is innocent until proven guilty and has
 the right to legal counsel and to be examined by a doctor if imprisoned. Although
 trials are officially public, in politically sensitive cases security measures effectively
 prevent public access. Legal counsel is supposed to be available to the indigent in
 criminal and civil matters; however, defendants often do not receive representation.
 Court cases are heard in public before a presiding judge and two accompanying
 judges. The latter receives assistance from two persons-assessors-who are not
 members of the bench, but who are thought to possess sufficient legal sophistication
 to comprehend court proceedings. The Government chooses assessors from the pub-
 lic at large, but credible reports indicate that political and ethnic affiliations play
 a role in the selection.
 The creation of the Committee for the Support of Political Prisoners (CSPP) was
 announced in February (see Section 4). CSPP reported that the Government held
 52 political prisoners, including 40 FRUD dissidents who had been handed over by
 Ethiopian authorities or FRUD rebels captured in clashes with the army, and 12
 relatives of former cabinet director Ismael Guedi who were arrested in October al-
 legedly for hoarding weapons.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Government infringed on these rights. The Constitution provides for the inviolabil-
 ity of the family, home, correspondence, and communications. The law also requires
 that the authorities obtain a warrant before conducting searches on private prop-
 erty. However, in practice the Government does not always obtain warrants before
 conducting such searches, and it reportedly monitors and sometimes disrupts the
 communications of some regime opponents. Authorities harassed the family mem-
 bers of opposition leaders (see Section 3).
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of the
 press; however, at times the Government restricted this right in practice. The law
 prohibits the dissemination of false information and regulates the publication of
 newspapers. The Constitution prohibits slander.
 The Government owns the principal weekly newspaper, La Nation. There are sev-
 eral opposition-run weekly and monthly publications that circulate freely and openly
 criticize the Government. However, journalists, and even vendors of opposition pa-
 pers, occasionally are jailed or -intimidated by police. The Government also owns the
 radio and television stations. The official media generally are uncritical of govern-
 ment leaders and government policy.
 On February 17, two leaders of the United Front of the Djiboutian Opposition
 (FUOD) were arrested after the FUOD's newsletter A-Wahda published an article
 calling Finance Minister Yacin Elmi Bouh a crook. They were released a week later
 after paying a fine. In 1997 government security forces had seized equipment and
 documents from the FUOD and the PRD faction not recognized by the Government
 in order to prevent them from publishing newsletters and communiques. None of
 this equipment had been returned at year's end.
 
 
 125
 On May 5, Omar Ahmed Vincent and Aboubaker Ahmed Aouled, editors of the
 GDR newsletter Populaire, were arrested on the basis of a complaint by the Finance
 Minister. Populaire had reprinted an article from the legal PRD's newsletter, which
 asserted that the Finance Minister had misappropriated funds while at his previous
 post as head of the government pension agency. On May 6, a judge ordered the two
 editors to each pay $5,650 (1 illion DF) as reparation to the minister, and a $565
 (100,000 DF) fine to the court. In addition Populaire was banned for 6 months. In
 May a computer and printer used to produce Populaire was confiscated from the
 home of GDR leader Mouxnin Bahdon and has not been returned. Populaire resumed
 publication in November.
 The head of the legal PRD, Abdillahi Hamareiteh Guelleh, was imprisoned for 10
 days in May after his party's newsletter ran an article criticizing the head of the.
 government-owned electric company for not making a better deal for a new electrical
 system.
 In March the Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU) brought the cases of former
 Djiboutian parliamentarians Moumin Bahdon Farah, Ahmed Boulaleh Barreh
 "Gabayow" (also see Section i.e.), and Ali Mahamade Houmed to the United Nations
 Human Rights Commission. The three, along with two others, were arrested and de-
 tained for 6 months atid prohibited from running for office for 5 years after they
 signed a communiqud that criticized President Gouled. The IPU expressed concern
 that the Government had violated the parliamentarians' constitutionally protected
 immunity and right to free speech.
 There are no specific laws or criminal sanctions that threaten academic freedom.
 In general, teachers may speak and conduct research without restriction, provided
 that they do not violate sedition laws.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The right to free assembly is
 provided for in the Constitution; however, the Government at times effectively lim-
 itd this right in practice. The Ministry of Interior requires permits for peacefu as-
 sembly and monitors opposition activities. While permits generally are approved,
 the Government commonly uses a show of police force and threatening tactics to in-
 timidate and discourage would-be demonstrators. Some opposition leaders effectively
 practiced self-censorship and, rather than provoke a government crackdown, re-
 trained from organizing popular demonstrations. Teachers' union members did not
 conduct street protests, and there were no reports of teachers being arrested for
 their union activity during the 1997-98 school year. In November police disrupted
 a rally in support of PND leader Aden Robleh, detaining approximately 100 persons
 and allegedly beating others (see Sections 1.c. and 1.d.) In December the police dis-
 rupted several hundred high school students who were protesting the termination
 of their stipends. Police used tear gas to disrupt the protest and reportedly beat
 some of the students.
 The Constitution provides for freedom of association provided that certain legal
 requirements are met; however, the Government restricts this right in practice. A
 referendum held in 1993 approved limiting the number of political parties to four.
 This result has not yet been codified into law. The Government took advantage of
 an absence of leadership in the main opposition party, the PRD, following the late
 1996 death of its leader, and conferred legal recognition on what appeared to be the
 weaker half of the party. In 1997 police detained the leader of the unrecognized
 PRD faction, Daher Ahmed Farah, and charged him in a closed hearing with ille-
 aly operating a political party, illegally publishing a newspaper, disseminating
 alse information, forgery (for the use of party seals), usurping a title, and organiz-
 ing an illegal demonstration. In 1997, Daher was given "provisional liberty," which
 grants him freedom while his case still is pending.
 Nonpolitical associations must register and be approved by the Ministry of Inte-
 rior.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Government generally respects religious freedom;
 however, proselytizing is discouraged. Islam is the state reigion. Virtually the en-
 tire population is Sunni Muslim. There are also a small number of Catholics. The
 Government imposes no sanctions on those who choose to ignore Islamic teachings.
 The foreign community supports Roman Catholic, Protestant, Greek Orthodox,
 and Ethiopian Orthodox churches. Foreign clergy and missionaries may perform
 charitable works.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Constitution allows freedom of movement; however, there were in-
 stances in which authorities limited this right.
 In general citizens may travel or emigrate without restriction or interference.
 However, a judge may order a passport seized for those under judicial surveillance
 or awaiting trial. In March Aicha Dabaleh, wife of imprisoned Afar leader Mohamed
 Kadami, was denied a passport despite a court ruling allowing her to travel abroad
 
 
 (see Section 1.d.). On March 29, after paying a, $22,605 (4 million DF) deposit,
 Dabaleh was given a "laissez passer" permitting her to travel to France. The pass-
 port seized in 1997 from Jean-Paul Noel Abdi, then a dissident member of the Na-
 tional Assembly, was returned to him in March. In October the passport of GDR
 leader Moumin Bahdon Farah was seized at the airport as he tried to board a flight
 to Saudi Arabia, where he was to receive medical treatment, even though in August
 a court ordered the lifting of the judicial control placed on Moumin in May (see Sec-
 tion 3) and that his passport be returned to him to enable him to leave the country.
 On October 17, a judged seized the passport of PND leader Aden Robleh. On Decem-
 ber 5, authorities seized the passport of human rights attorney Aref Mohamed Aref
 without explanation when he attempted to travel to Paris to attend a commemora-
 tion ceremony for the fiftieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration on Human
 R ht.
 Rito 18,000 Djiboutian Afars sought asylum in Ethiopia during the 1991-94 civil
 war. At least 10,000 are said to have repatriated themselves since the 1994 Peace
 Accord. According to Ethiopian authorities, some 8,000 reportedly remain in Ethio-
 pia. Because the displaced Afar were not in refugee camps, and because Mars are
 indigenous to Ethiopia and Eritrea as well, it is difficult to estimate their number.
 The law provides for the granting of refugee or asylee status in accordance with
 the 1951 U.N. Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees and its 1967 Protocol.
 The Government does offer first asylum; however, the government committee re-
 sponsible for determining refugee's status has not met since 1995, and the Govern-
 ment does not recognize those under the UNHOR's protection absent this approval.
 The country hosts up to 100,000 refugees and illegal immigrants from neighboring
 countries, equal to about one-fifth of the population. The U.N. High Commissioner
 for Refugees (UNHOR) assists 21,000 Somali and 1,000 Ethiopian residents of
 Djibouti's two remaining refugee camps. Another camp near the Ethiopian and So-
 mali borders was closed in April' due to security concerns. Some 2,500 Ethiopian and
 Somali urban refugees are registered with the UNHCR in Djibouti City.
 There has been no major repatriation since the UNHCR's 1994-96 repatriation of
 35,000 Ethiopian refugees and migrants from the capital. The Djiboutian National
 Office for the Assistance of Refugees and Displaced Persons (ONARS) reported that
 it deports up to a thousand Ethiopians each week. Following the fighting between
 Ethiopia and Eritrea in May, hundreds of Ethiopians and Eritreans transited
 Djibouti en route to their homelands.
 In January the Government expelled three Ethiopians who were under UNHCR
 protection. The UNHCR objected to these actions, which disregarded the procedures
 to which the Government had agreed with the UNHCR.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Although the Constitution provides for the right of citizens to change their gov-
 ernment, in practice citizens have not yet been allowed to exercise this right fully.
 The RPP carefully controlled the implementation of the four-party system to sup-
 press any organized opposition. The RPP alliance with the legal FRUD party won
 all 65 seats in the December 1997 legislative elections. The elections took place
 without international observers amid opposition claims of fraud. Presidential elec-
 tions are scheduled for April 1999. Efforts by both the legal and unrecognized oppo-
 sition parties to unify floundered due to disagreements among their leaders over
 who should lead the united opposition.
 The 1994 peace agreement between the Government and the FRUD required that
 FRUD members be included in senior government positions. Two FRUD members
 who were named to the Cabinet in June 1995 remain in office. The government-rec-
 ognized faction of the FRUD was registered as a political party in 1996. The unrec-
 ognized FRUD faction includes members who refused to accept the terms of the
 peace accord, as well as Afars extradited from Ethiopia in 1997 (see Section 2.d.).
 Government harassment of opposition leaders was a problem. In May Moumin
 Bahdon, the President of the GDR, was questioned about his links with FRUD
 rebels and his passport was taken from him. Authorities took away Bahdon's pass-
 port again in October even though a court had ordered the passport returned in Au-
 gust (see Section 2.d.). Bahdon's family members claimed that they faced constant
 harassment from the Government. In May one of Bahdon's daughters was expelled
 temporarily from school because of who her father was, and another daughter was
 fired from her job at the government-owned electric company. In the months follow-
 ing the May detention of Abdullahi Hamareith, head of the PRD faction recognized
 by the Government, for publishing an article in the PRD newsletter criticizing a
 government business deal(see Sections 1.d. and 2.a.), some close relatives and asso-
 ciats of Hamareiteh had their electricity cut off and were fired from their jobs. In
 
 
 October after PND leader Aden Robleh publicly criticized chief of staff Ismael Omar
 Guelleh, the Government recognized Robleh's rival, Mahdi Ahmed Abdillahi as head
 of the PND (see Section 1.d.). However, Mahdi remains under investigation for the
 bombing of a Djiboutian cafd in 1990 (see Section 1.d.).
 Although legally entitled to participate in the political process, women largely are
 excluded from senior positions in government and in the political parties. There are
 no women in the Cabinet or in Parliament. Khadija Abeba, President of the Su-
 preme Court, is the highest-ranking female official and, according to the Constitu-
 tion, would become interim president of Djibouti should that position become va-
 cant. She and six other women serve as judges, and one is a director in the Ministry
 of Foreign Affairs. While women have the right to vote, there were no female can-
 didates in the December 1997 legislative elections.
 The President's subclan, the Issa Mamassans, wields disproportionate power in af-
 fairs of state. Afars hold a number of high ministerial posts, but are not so well rep-
 resented at lower levels. Somali clans other than the Issa and Djiboutians of Yemeni
 origin are limited unofficially to one ministerial post each. There are also informal
 limits on the number of seats for each group in the Parliament.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The Government remains hostile to the formation of local human rights groups.
 The Government arrested and released Mohamed Houmed Souleh, the leader of the
 Association for the Defense of Human Rights and Liberties (ADDHL), several times
 between 1993 and 1996 for criticizing military abuses in the civil conflict. He
 stopped speaking publicly in 1996 after security forces killed his brother (see Section
 l.a.) and threatened other relatives. In 1997 the Health Ministry hired Souleh after
 he agreed to stop criticizing the Government, and the ADDHL stopped functioning.
 In February the ADDHL resumed activity as a pro-government organization and
 has not resumed its investigations into, or criticisms of, human right abuses.
 The formation of the Committee in Support of Political Prisoners (CSPP) was an-
 nounced in February. The leader of the committee, Kamil Hassan, was detained
 shortly afterwards, along with the two editors of the FUOD newsletter that pub-
 lished the communiqu6 announcing the CSPP's formation (see Sections 1.d. and
 2.a.).
 The Union of Djiboutian Women (UNFD) and the Djiboutian Association for the
 Promotion of the Family (ADEPF) promote the rights of women and children.
 The Government criticized the October 5 occupation of its embassy in Paris by
 four French-based Afar and human rights groups, which demanded the release of
 political prisoners and an end to rapes by soldiers.
 The ICRO visited the country during the year (see Section l.c.). In October a rep-
 resentative of Amnesty International visited the country and met with victims of
 human rights abuses and a senior official in the Ministry of Justice.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution prohibits discrimination on the basis of language, race, sex, or
 religion; however, discrimination against women and ethnic minorities persists. In
 particular, the Government's enforcement of laws to protect women and children is
 weak.
 Women.-Violence against women exists but reported cases are few. The Govern-
 ment has been concerned about the problem of rape, and the 1995 revised Penal
 Code includes sentences of up to 20 years in prison for rapists. More than 100 such
 cases were tried during the year, but only a few led to conviction. Violence against
 women normally is dealt with within the family or clan structure rather than in the
 courts. The police rarely intervene in domestic violence incidents, and the media re-
 port only the most extreme examples, such as murder. In almost all the cases of
 the rape of Afar women by soldiers in recent years, the victims did not press
 charges due to shame and fear (see Section 1.c.).
 Women legally possess full civil rights, but in practice, due to custom and tradi-
 tional societal discrimination in education, they play a secondary role in public life
 and have fewer employment opportunities than men. Few women work in manage-
 rial and professional positions; women largely are confined to trade and secretarial
 fields. Customary law, which is based on Islamic Shari'a law, discriminates against
 women in such areas as inheritance, divorce, and travel (see Section 2.d.). Male chil-
 dren inherit larger percentages of an estate than do female children. Women are
 not permitted to travel without the permission of an adult male relative. The few
 educated women increasingly turn to the regular courts to defend their interests.
 
 
 In July an office was created under the Presidency to improve the situation of
 women and children in society.
 Children.-The Government devotes almost no public funds to the advancement
 of children's rights and welfare. A few charitable organizations work with children.
 Primary education is compulsory however, the Government does not monitor com-
 pliance. Many schools are in poor- condition and need upgrading. The number of
 classrooms for secondary students is inadequate, and only approximately 20 percent
 of children who start secondary school complete their education. Only 62 percent of
 girls attend primary school as opposed to 73 percent of boys, and only 23 percent
 of girls attend secondary school as opposed to 33 percent of boys. Girls made up only
 36 percent of all secondary students.,
 According to a recent report, as many as 98 percent of females age 7 or older had
 undergone female genital mutilation (FGM), which* is widely condemned by inter-
 national health experts as damaging to both physical and psychological health. FGM
 traditionally is performed on girls between the ages of 7 and 10. In 1988 the Union
 of Djiboutian Women (UNFD) began an educational campaign against infibulation,
 the most extensive and dangerous form of FGM. The campaign has had only a lim-
 ited impact on the prevalence of this custom, particularly in rural areas, where it
 is pervasive. After the 1995 U.N. Women's Conference in Cairo, Egypt, the UNFD
 declared that all forms of mutilation should be forbidden. The revised Penal Code
 that went into effect in 1995 states that "violence causing genital mutilation" is
 punishable by 5 years' imprisonment and a fine of over $5,600 (1 million DF). How-
 ever, the Government has not yet convicted anyone under this statute. The efforts
 of the UNFD and other groups -appeared to be having some effect, at least in the
 capital city. In 1997 some health workers reported a precipitous drop in the number
 of hospitalizations related to FGM in Djibouti City. Many believe that the incidence
 of the most extreme procedure, infibulation, has decreased, although no systematic
 data was available on the problem. U.N. and other experts believe that lesser forms
 of FGM were still widely practiced and that infibulation still was common in rural
 areas. During the year, the members of one Djiboutian family attempted to obtain
 asylum in a foreign country in order to flee family pressure that FGM be performed
 on their daughters.
 Child abuse exists, but is not thought to be common. The Government has not
 addressed child abuse, which often is punished lightly. For example, when a child
 is raped or abused, the perpetrator usually is fined an amount sufficient to cover
 the child's medical care. The Government has not used applicable existing provi-
 sions of the Penal Code to deal with child abuse more severely.
 In July an office was created under the Presidency to improve the situation of
 women and children in society.
 People With Disabilities.-The Government does not mandate accessibility to
 buildings or government services for the disabled. Although disabled persons have
 access to education and public health facilities, there is no specific legislation that
 addresses the needs of the disabled, and there are no laws or regulations that pre-
 vent job discrimination against disabled persons. The disabled have difficulty find-
 ing employment in an economy where at least 60 percent of the able-bodied adult
 male population is underemployed or jobless.
 NationallRaciallEthnic Minorities.-The Government continued to discriminate
 against citizens on the basis of ethnicity in employment and job advancement. Dis-
 crimination based on ethnic and clan affiliation limited the role of members of mi-
 nority groups and clans in government and politics. Somali Issas control the ruling
 party, the civil and security services, and the military forces.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-'Under the Constitution, workers are free to join
 unions and to strike provided that they comply with legally prescribed require-
 ments. Since 1992 unions have been free to join or form other confederations. The
 state body, the General Union of Djiboutian Workers (UGTD), and the Union of
 Djiboutian Workers (UDT) formed a confederation in 1995 and have gained increas-
 ing support despite government harassment. In 1996 the Government sealed off the
 headquarters of the UDT/UGTD confederation, and UDT/UGTD confederation bank
 accounts remained frozen at year's end. Nevertheless, in the small formal economy,
 about 70 percent of workers are members of the combined UDTIUGTD confed-
 eration. Previously the Government controlled individual unions by making mem-
 bership mandatory in the state-organized labor confederation. To counter the UDT/
 UGTD, the Government created the Djiboutian Labor Congress (CODJITRA), com-
 posed of Ministry of Labor officials. At its June 1997 meeting, the International
 abor Organization (ILO) determined that the Government had violated the ILO
 
 
 Constitution by not allowing a member of the UDT/UGTD confederation to join the
 workers' delegation at the meeting.
 An ILO delegation visited in anuary, and in February the Government agreed
 to begin a dialogue with the UDT/UGTD regarding the creation of a tripartite labor
 commission consisting of unions, government and business representatives. The
 Government also accepted an invitation to the ILO June meeting in Geneva. How-
 ever, the Government did not send representatives to Geneva and had not begun
 the promised dialogue at year's end. As a result of the ILO visit, the UDT/UGTD
 were able to reclaim their headquarters, which had been taken from them in 1996.
 However, their bank accounts remained frozen at year's end.
 The law requires representatives of employees who plan to strike to contact the
 Interior Ministry 48 hours in advance. Teachers' strikes were more muted during
 the year than in previous years. Kamil Hassan, a schoolteacher, previously had been
 detained in February 1997 as a leader of a teacher's strike, and still was not per-
 mitted to teach in public schools.
 In March public heath care workers went on strike to protest a reduction in sala-
 ries. Although the Labor Law prohibits employer retribution against strikers, the
 health care workers' strike resulted in police beatings, arbitrary arrests, and the fir-
 ing of six detained union leaders (see Sections 1.c. and 1.d.). During this strike over
 100 health care workers were detained briefly on March 22 and 23.
 Unions are free to maintain relations and exchanges with labor organizations
 abroad. The UDT has been a member of the International Confederation of Free
 Trade Unions (ICFTU) since 1994.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Although labor has the legal
 right to organize and bargain collectively, collective bargaining rarely occurs. Rela-
 tions between employers and workers are informal and paternalistic. Wage rates
 generally are established unilaterally by employers on the basis of Ministry of Labor
 guidelines. In disputes over wages or health and safety problems, the Ministry of
 abor encourages direct resolution by labor representatives and employers. Workers
 or employers may request formal administrative hearings before the Ministry's in-
 spection service, but critics claim that the service suffers from poor enforcement,
 due to its low priority and inadequate funding. The law prohibits antiunion dis-
 crimination, and employers found legally guilty are required to reinstate workers
 fired for union activities. However, the Government does not appear to enforce the
 law.
 An export processing zone (EPZ) was established in 1994. Firms in the EPZ are
 exempt from the Governmenfs social security and medical insurance programs. In-
 stead, they must provide either government or private accident insurance. The mini-
 mum wage in the EPZ is approximately $1 (176 DF) per hour. Although the regular
 workweek is 40 hours, in the EPZ it is 45 hours. An employee who works for the
 same firm in the EPZ for at least 1 year has the right to 15 days' annual leave,
 compared with 30 days in the rest of the country (see Section 6.e.).
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compusory Labor.-The law prohibits all forced or
 compulsory labor, including by children. While the law generally is observed, there
 are reports that members of the security forces sometimes compel illegal immigrants
 to work for them under the threat of deportation. There were no reports of forced
 child labor.
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment.-The law
 prohibits all labor by children under the age of 14, but the Government does not
 always enforce this prohibition effectively, and a shortage of labor inspectors re-
 duces the likelihood of investigation. Children generally are not employed for haz-
 ardous work. Children may and do work in family-owned businesses, such as res-
 taurants and small shops, at all hours. The law prohibits forced or compulsory
 labor, including by children; there were no reports of forced child labor (see Section
 6.c.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-Only a small minority of the population is en-
 gaged in wage employment. The Government administratively sets minimum wage
 rates according to occupational categories, and the Ministry of Labor is charged with
 enforcement. The monthly wage rate for unskilled labor, set in 1976, is approxi-
 mately $90 (15,840 DF). Most employers pay more than the minimum wage. Some
 workers also receive housing and transportation allowances. The minimum wage for
 unskilled labor does not provide adequate compensation for a worker and family to
 maintain a decent standard of living.
 By law the workweek is 40 hours, often spread over 6 days. Some employers ask
 employees to work up to 12 hours per day and pay them an additional wage. Work-
 ers are provided daily and weekly rest periods and paid annual leave. The Ministry
 of Labor is responsible for enforcing occupational health and safety standards,
 wages, and work hours. Because enforcement is ineffective, workers sometimes face
 
 
 hazardous working conditions, particularly at the port. Workers rarely protest,
 mainly out of fear that they may be replaced by others -willing to accept the risks.
 There are no laws or regulations permitting workers to refuse to carry out dan-
 gerous work assignments without jeopardy to continued employment.
