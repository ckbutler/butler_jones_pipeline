 ARGENTINA
 Argentina is a functioning constitutional democracy with an
 independent bicameral legislature and an autonomous
 judiciary. Elections were held in 1985 for one-half of the
 seats in the lower house and for some seats in most provincial
 legislatures and many city councils. Political debate was
 free and open, all parties had access to the media, and the
 level of public participation in discussing the issues of the
 day was high. Violent incidents by unknown assailants,
 generally believed to be nongovernmental, occurred, resulting
 in one death--the first caused by terrorism since the return
 to democracy in December 1983. Most of the incidents appeared
 to be related to political or labor activities.
 The military and police operate under civilian political
 control, with charges of abuses reviewed by the courts.
 Criticism of the Government was tolerated and opposition
 viewpoints were freely expressed. An autonomous judiciary and
 a functioning democratic political system work to insure
 respect for human rights. Trade union freedom was greater
 than at any time during the past decade and strikes occurred
 with some frequency, including two national strikes. Respect
 for individual rights was strong. Human rights groups
 continued to demand a complete accounting for past
 disappearances and punishment for those responsible. For the
 first time in Argentina's history, senior military officers,
 who once held de facto governing power, were tried and
 convicted for human rights violations, including homicide and
 torture. Five of the 9 defendants were convicted and given
 sentences that ranged from 54 months to life imprisonment; the
 other 4 were acquitted. Trials of terrorists were also held
 during 1985 with 3 individuals convicted and sentenced to 25,
 22, and 10 years in prison.
 Argentina, which continued to enjoy a relatively good standard
 of living in 1985, was beset by a number of severe economic
 problems including a high rate of inflation and a large
 foreign debt. In June, the Government took steps to address
 those problems, including an innovative "shock program" that
 quickly reduced inflation from over 30 percent a month to
 between 2 and 4 percent a month.
 In 1985, Argentina continued to consolidate the dramatic
 improvements in human rights stemming from the successful 1983
 transition from a military government to a freely elected
 civilian government. An independent press offered views
 covering the political spectrum.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There is no outstanding charge by human rights groups of any
 death occurring during 1985 that was politically motivated or
 instigated by the Government. One person was killed by a
 terrorist bombing in October.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no known abductions, secret arrests, or
 disappearances linked to or condoned by the Government during
 
 
 ARGENTINA
 1985. A significant number of kidnapings occurred, most of
 them believed to be by common criminals to extort money. Not
 all were reported to the authorities and many ended with the
 release of the victim without identification of the
 perpetrators, although some criminals were apprehended and
 others were killed in raids.
 Accounting for the large number of persons who disappeared
 between 1973 and 1980 and punishing those responsible
 continued to be major issues in 1985. The courts also
 continued to investigate cases of unmarked graves and some
 exhumed corpses were identified as persons who had
 disappeared. Human rights groups documented several cases of
 children of parents who had disappeared being raised by
 adoptive parents, some of whom were former security
 personnel. In a few cases, children were reunited with their
 parents or other relatives.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 The Constitution prohibits the use of torture. President
 Alfonsin signed into law in January 1985 a criminal code
 reform that punishes torture with penalties similar to those
 applied for homicide. Although some human rights groups
 maintain that police beatings of criminals continued after
 January, judges have applied the new provisions of the code.
 In April, a judge ordered the arrest of four members of the
 Buenos Aires provincial police force for allegedly torturing
 (by beating them severely) four prisoners in January. The
 policemen were later acquitted. According to officials, the
 only other formal accusation was against members of the Santa
 Fe police force and penitentiary service for allegedly beating
 17 prisoners in the Coronada model correctional institute in
 August after the prisoners refused to return to their cells.
 The Interior Ministry's undersecretariat for human rights
 investigated and passed the accusation to the Santa Fe
 province penal judge for investigation. The undersecretariat
 also issued a press release stating that it had confirmed that
 17 prisoners had serious bruises and that 1 had tried to
 commit suicide after the alleged beatings. The investigation
 is still in progress as are investigations into the alleged
 torture of prisoners during the years of military rule
 (1976-1983).
 Despite improved prison conditions since the return of
 democracy in 1983, there were protests, hunger strikes, and
 riots in a few prisons during 1985 allegedly resulting from
 violent treatment of prisoners during cell-block searches,
 disrespectful treatment of visiting family members, and
 prisoners' demands for better food and living conditions and a
 reduction in their sentences. At least one prisoner committed
 suicide and another died during the riots. In July several
 human rights activists condemned prison conditions.
 Government officials said they were working to improve those
 conditions. Argentine prisons suffer from overcrowding, but
 are generally sanitary.
 Some provinces began giving their police mandatory human
 rights courses, which included study of the Universal
 Declaration of Human Rights, and stressed that torture would
 not be tolerated.

 ARGENTINA
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Argentina has a well-developed legal code containing
 provisions such as habeas corpus and controls on police arrest
 and investigatory powers. In 1984, Congress passed a law that
 strengthened habeas corpus rights. The Argentine penal code,
 however, gives the police and courts authority to detain
 persons incommunicado for up to eight days during
 investigations. Even in the case of minor offenses, holding
 of suspects incommunicado for a few days is common. The
 Constitution also confers power on the Executive Branch to
 detain suspects during a State of Siege, such as was declared
 on October 25 by President Alfonsin for a planned 60 days
 after a significant-increase in terrorist bombings occurred.
 The State of Siege was lifted on December 9.
 Forced or compulsory labor is forbidden.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The Argentine judiciary functioned normally in 1985. It was
 generally recognized as fair, reasonably independent, and
 effective. The penal code provides for public trials and all
 rulings by lower courts, civilian and military, may be
 appealed to the Supreme Court. The major problems were the
 overcrowding of court dockets (e.g., the Supreme Court had a
 backlog of over 6,000 cases in late 1985), time-consuming
 written procedures, lack of personnel and administrative
 infrastructure, and low salaries (as in the rest of the public
 sector). As in most civil law countries, there is no trial by
 jury; verdicts are rendered by professional judges. The
 police have legal authority to judge misdemeanor cases, which
 are often settled by a senior police official instead of by a
 judge. The position of public defender exists but in 1985
 public defenders had caseloads far in excess of what they
 could handle competently, making it impossible to provide an
 adequate defense in all the cases assigned to them. The right
 to bail is provided by law and is observed in practice.
 The first civil trial in Argentina of military officers who
 once held de facto governing power began in April against nine
 former military commanders and junta members charged with
 criminal responsibility for human rights violations committed
 during the so-called "dirty war against subversion" of the
 mid-1970s, including homicide, torture, and illegal
 imprisonment. Defended by 22 lawyers, they were tried by a
 six-judge federal appellate court after the Supreme Court of
 the Armed Forces failed to complete its trial by the deadline
 set for it in 1984. The trial demonstrated a functioning
 judiciary able to handle the most controversial trial in the
 history of Argentina. The trial ended in December; 5 of the 9
 defendants-were found guilty and received sentences that
 ranged from 54 months to life imprisonment. Both the
 acquittals and the convictions will probably be appealed to
 the Supreme Court. In 1985 there were also trials of alleged
 terrorists, several of whom were convicted. These included
 the former governor of Cordoba province, Ricardo Obregon Cano,
 who was sentenced to 10 years in prison for illegal
 association with the Montoneros. Two members of the People's
 Revolutionary Army were sentenced to 25 and 22 years in prison
 for the 1974 murder of a judge. The trial of Mario Firmenich,
 a leader of the Montoneros, had not concluded by the end of
 the year.
 
 
 408
 ARGENTINA
 At the beginning of 1985, some Argentine human rights groups
 claimed there were still 15 political prisoners in jail. The
 Government argued they were common criminals convicted of
 crimes by either civil or military courts and that the
 Government could not summarily overturn those verdicts.
 Instead, the Government suggested that the prisoners request a
 judicial review of their cases. Some prisoners did and one
 was released during 1985. By the end of the year, 14 alleged
 political prisoners, who had been convicted of violent crimes,
 remained in jail.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home or
 Correspondence
 There were few reported cases of arbitrary intrusion by the
 State into the private life of individuals during 1985. Some
 monitoring of telephones was reported, however, and the owners
 of the newspaper Nuevo Diario publicly stated they had proof
 that the state information secretariat was tapping telephone
 conversations of the newspaper. Congressmen from both the
 governing party and the opposition made similar claims.
 Hidden microphones were found in the offices of opposition
 national senators; the Government denied it had anything to do
 with the microphones. In July, the executive branch submitted
 a bill to Congress that would provide penalties for arbitrary
 interference with personal privacy, home, or correspondence.
 When Congress adjourned on September 30, the bill had not yet
 been acted on.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 There were very few restrictions on freedom of speech and
 press during 1985. Criticism of the Government is tolerated
 and opposition viewpoints are freely expressed. An
 independent press offers views that cover the entire political
 spectrum. Argentine press freedom is greater than it has been
 in many years.
 Many radio and television stations owned by the Government
 were criticized publicly during the second half of 1985 for
 being biased in favor of the Government, for hiring government
 supporters, and for operating at large losses requiring
 government subsidies. The newspaper editors' association
 denounced an alleged campaign of intimidation to reduce
 criticism of the Government; officials denied the charge.
 Also, the Association of Argentine newspaper owners publicly
 criticized the inclusion of 2 journalists among the 12 men
 arrested in October during the State of Siege and claimed that
 the arrests were motivated by the journalists' critical
 positions toward the Government. There were also several
 violent attacks, including bombings, against government-owned
 radio and television stations by unidentified terrorists.
 There were no injuries, although damage was extensive.
 Academic freedom was respected. There were no reports of
 surveillance of political meetings on campuses or censorship
 of books. Enrollment in universities was higher in 1985 than
 in 1984, partly because of a new open-admission system.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 All groups and political parties, except subversive
 organizations previously outlawed for espousing violence, have
 
 
 ARGENTINA
 been free to organize and assemble since August 1982. Major
 rallies were held by political parties, including the
 Communist Party, during 1985.
 The labor movement is a major independent political and
 economic force. About one-third of the work force is
 unionized. The previous military regimes suspended various
 laws governing labor relations and systematically blocked many
 trade union rights. Recasting the codes to restore normal
 ground rules for industrial relations and trade union
 activities was still proceeding in 1985. For example,
 .-legislation covering collective bargaining, refinements to
 laws dealing with trade union structure and function, and the
 disposition of social welfare organizations formerly
 associated with unions had not been passed by Congress when it
 adjourned on September 30.
 Nevertheless, organized labor resumed most of its normal
 activities. In 1984 and 1985, the vast majority of unions
 held their first free elections since 1976. Although there
 was still no formal collective bargaining, numerous unions and
 the national labor organization, the General Confederation of
 Workers (CGT), were actively engaged in consultations with
 employers and the Government on issues affecting labor and the
 economy of the nation as a whole. Unions have the right to
 strike. Many exercised this right in support of their demands
 and the CGT led two one-day general strikes in 1985. On
 November 20, the Government issued a decree permitting
 collective bargaining on general working conditions, but
 excluding wages. The CGT publicly criticized the decree,
 claiming that it violated the Constitution and International
 Labor Organization accords.
 Unions are free to maintain ties with international labor
 bodies and are active in the international trade union
 movement.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Argentina's Constitution states that everyone has the right to
 practice his religion, but it also states that the Federal
 Government supports Roman Catholicism. Government financial
 support is given to the Roman Catholic Church. The
 Constitution requires the President and Vice President to be
 Catholics. Other religions must register with the Government
 to obtain the legal recognition required to operate freely;
 such recognition is provided with minimal difficulty.
 Missionaries from any religion are permitted to enter
 Argentina and to proselytize. The non-Catholic population is
 growing.
 The Jehovah's Witnesses are recognized by the Government, but
 about 100 Witnesses, all Argentines, have been sentenced to
 serve 3-1/2 years of civilian service at military
 installations for their refusal to accept compulsory military
 service. Conditions are not onerous and furloughs are given
 for as long as a month at a time. Civil judges ruled that the
 punishment was excessive and in 15 to 20 individual cases
 ordered witnesses released. The executive branch submitted
 draft legislation to the Congress in December 1984 that would
 permit alternative service for conscientious objectors opposed
 to military service on moral or religious grounds. Although
 the Congress did not pass the legislation in 1985, the
 executive branch began exempting baptized Witnesses from
 military service during the year.
 
 
 410
 ARGENTINA
 Argentina's Jewish community (250,000) practices its religion
 without restraint, although occasional anti-Semitic incidents
 continue to occur. In the preelectoral period of September
 and October, there was an increase in anti-semitic graffiti,
 in anonymous threats against Jewish leaders and schools, and
 in violence (one Jewish school was bombed at midnight,
 producing no injuries but causing extensive damage, and a
 grenade was found outside another Jewish school). In the
 current crime wave, the fact that several of those kidnapped
 for ransom were Jewish raised concern, but there is no
 substantial evidence of racial or religious motivation. The
 Government publicly condemned religious prejudice and assigned
 police to guard the schools. The Government also submitted
 proposed legislation to Congress in September 1984 that would
 provide penalties for racial, religious, and other forms of
 discrimination. The lower house passed the bill in June but
 the Senate had not by the time Congress adjourned on September
 30.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Internal and foreign travel and emigration are basically
 unrestricted. Former exiles continued to return to Argentina
 during 1985, some as a result of the Government's policy of
 encouraging such Argentines to return, and some with financial
 assistance from the United Nations High Commissioner for
 Refugees. Non-Argentine refugees in Argentina are not forced
 to return to countries from which they fled or in which they
 fear persecution. Moreover, an amnesty covering the period
 between November 1984 and March 1985 allowed all illegal
 immigrants in the country at the time to apply for resident
 status. Nearly 150,000 people took advantage of that
 amnesty. In October, however, the Government announced that
 retroactive to August 8, permanent resident visas would be
 issued only to people with at least $30,000 to invest in
 Argentina. The Government said the measure would only be
 temporary until Argentina recovers economically and pointed to
 the lack of jobs, hospitals, housing, and food as reasons for
 the decision. The new requirement has many exceptions, such
 as clerics, scientists, professors, writers, technicians,
 businessmen, artists, athletes, and cultural or political
 personalities who are working for solvent entities or are
 considered valuable to the national interest, as well as their
 parents, children, and spouses.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 In October 1983, the President, Vice President, two Senators,
 all 254 Deputies of the Lower House of the Legislature,
 provincial governors and legislators, and mayors and municipal
 councils were elected directly in free and democratic
 elections. Another 44 national senators were elected by
 provincial legislatures in November 1983. Elections for
 one-half the national deputies in the lower house and for part
 of the members of most provincial legislatures and many city
 councils were held in November 1985.
 Thirteen political parties covering the political spectrum,
 including the Communist Party, qualified as national parties
 and presented candidates in 1983 and again in 1985. Other
 parties qualified in individual provinces. There is a large,
 politically important, active opposition that operates
 
 
 411
 ARGENTINA
 openly. Women and minorities have full political rights and
 are not excluded from political life.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigations of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Argentina cooperates with both the U.N. Human Rights
 Commission and the Organization of American States'
 Inter-American Human Rights Commission. The Government signed
 and ratified the American Convention on Human Rights in 1984.
 Although the lower house approved the U.N. Convention on Civil
 and Political Rights and the U.N. Convention on Economic,
 Social, and Cultural Rights in February 1984, the Senate was
 still studying the two U.N. Conventions when it adjourned for
 1985. The civilian Government also reversed its military
 predecessor's position on the draft U.N. Convention on Torture
 and supported the draft in 1984, the first time an Argentine
 government had done so. The new Argentine position helped
 lead to the subsequent approval of the draft in December 1984
 by the UN General Assembly. In February 1985, Argentina was
 one of the first signatories of the new Convention. In
 October, the Government announced it had approved the
 International Convention on the Repression and Punishment of
 the Crime of Apartheid, which was established by the U.N.
 General Assembly in 1973.
 Eleven human rights organizations operated freely in 1985,
 despite occasional threats and some harassment from
 unidentified sources. One human rights activist was shot at
 by unknown assailants and the apartment building of two others
 was bombed. Human rights groups continued to bring to court
 cases related to people who disappeared.
 Amnesty International's 1985 report, covering 1984, noted that
 the number of remaining prisoners convicted of politically
 motivated offenses decreased throughout 1984, with the release
 of over 130 prisoners. Freedom House rated Argentina "free."
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 Argentina has a population of 30.7 million with a growth rate
 of 1.5 percent, a relatively good standard of living, and a
 per capita gross national product of $2070 as reported in 1983.
 Inflation was very high during the first half of 1985, before
 implementation of an imaginative economic program which kept
 inflation in the second half at a 10-year low. Investment
 remained low throughout 1985. Unemployment rose from 3.6
 percent in October 1984 to 6.3 percent in April 1985. Real
 wages decreased for all income groups and in all sectors in
 1985.
 In the largely middle-class Argentine society, 80 percent of
 the population lives in urban areas and at least 65 percent
 own their homes. Most have access to medical facilities. The
 average Argentine enjoys a healthy, high-protein diet that
 provided 124.7 percent of the daily caloric requirement in
 1977. Fifty-seven percent of the population had access to
 safe water in 1980. In 1985, life expectancy at birth was
 70.2 years and the infant mortality rate was 34.1 per 1,000
 live births.
 
 
 412
 ARGENTINA
 The Government's national nutritional program was expanded in
 1985 and provided a major dietary supplement for about 1.5
 million of the poorest Argentines, especially in the few
 pockets of abject poverty. The Government announced plans to
 reduce the housing shortage and a 5 percent payroll tax
 subsidizes low-income housing.
 The adult literacy rate in 1970 was 93.5 percent for males and
 91.7 percent for females. The adjusted primary school
 enrollment ratio was 123.5 percent in 1982 (male: 123.9;
 female: 123.1).
 Argentina offers comprehensive protection of workers' rights
 both in law and in practice. The maximum workday is 8 hours.
 The maximum workweek is 48 hours. Premiums must be paid for
 work beyond those limits. Children under 14 years of age may
 not work except in the family. Minors between 14 and 15 may
 work but not more than 6 hours a day or 36 hours a week. The
 same law applies to minors between 16 and 18, although
 competent authority may make an exception for this age group.
 Rules governing vacations, minimum wages, and occupational
 health and safety compare favorably with those existing in
 industrial nations of the West and are followed in practice.
 Women in Argentina are active in government, the professions,
 politics, and private voluntary organizations, but they have
 to contend with a variety of discriminatory mechanisms that
 are rooted in cultural, economic, religious, and social
 structures. There is no official policy of discrimination
 against them. In its first year in office, the Alfonsin
 administration adopted a position against discrimination and
 submitted draft legislation to Congress in September 1984 that
 would ban sex discrimination. That bill was approved by the
 lower House in June 1985 but the Senate was still studying it
 when Congress adjourned on September 30. Congress did,
 however, ratify the U.N. Convention for the Elimination of
 Discrimination Against Women. The Health and Social Action
 Ministry began a campaign to publicize the rights of women in
 Argentine society.
 There is no divorce but family legislation was liberalized in
 September 1985 when Congress passed legislation submitted by
 the executive branch which gave both parents legal authority
 over their children (thereby allowing women to travel abroad
 with their minor children without the express consent of their
 husbands), assumed that the decisions of one parent had the
 consent of the other unless expressly challenged in court, and
 gave equality before the law to children born in and out of
 wedlock.
 Women participate freely in politics in Argentina. There were
 scores of women candidates in the 1985 elections and women won
 4 of the 127 seats in the lower house that were up for
 election. About 20 percent of Argentina's full professors and
 about 50 percent of the assistant professors are women. One
 private university has a woman rector. Almost 50 percent of
 the medical and law school graduates in 1985 were women.
