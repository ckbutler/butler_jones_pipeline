 BARBADOS
 Barbadians enjoy a free and democratic system. When
 Barbados' constitution was proclaimed on November
 29, 1966, its drafters noted the island's traditional
 attachment to free institutions and to independence.
 A parliament has sat in Barbados since 1639. A basic
 statement of the rights and privileges of sarbadians,
 known as the Charter of Barbados, was proclaimed in
 1652 and has been upheld by those governing the island.
 1.   Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 Torture is specifically prohibited in Chapter 3, Section
 2 of the constitution and is not practiced.
 b.   Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 There have been no reports of any such treatment or
 punishment.
 The constitution does not prohibit use of the death
 penalty, which has been carried out in three cases
 in the past five years. Prison conditions are humane.
 Prisoners are not physically maltreated and food is
 adequate. Attorneys have ready access to their clients.
 c. Disappearances
 There have been no reports of disappearances.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 The constitution prohibits arbitrary arrest and imprison-
 ment and this prohibition is respected in practice.
 The right of habeas corpus is guaranteed and honored
 in practice.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The constitution provides that persons charged with
 a criminal offense be given a fair, public hearing
 within a reasonable time by an independent and impartial
 court. Defendants are presumed to be innocent until
 proven guilty. These guarantees are respected in
 practice.
 f. Invasion of the Home
 The constitution prohibits arbitrary search or entry
 and this is respected in practice.
 2.   Government Policies Relating to the Fulfillment
 of Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health
 Care and Education
 The Barbadian economy has experienced three years
 of solid growth aided by a stable political situation
 and sound economic management. While the oil price
 increases of 1979 and the general recession will cut
 
 
 345
 into that growth, 1980 should see continued real growth
 in gross domestic product.
 The 1966 proclamation of the constitution calls for
 the government to promote the general welfare of the
 citizens of Barbados through equitable distribution
 of wealth. Both past and present governments have
 pursued that goal while respecting private property.
 For example, before the 1976 election, the present
 Barbados Labour Party (BLP) government committed itself
 to several public welfare goals, including improvements
 in public housing and community centers and an overhaul
 of the somewhat regressive tax system. These goals
 have been achieved. Citizens have long enjoyed access
 to public and private educational systems, and have
 an adult literacy rate estimated at 97 percent. The
 government has embarked on a program of expanding
 the secondary school system to ensure that sufficient
 facilities exist for pupils leaving the primary system.
 Quality care is available to all residents through
 local clinics and hospitals under the government's
 health program. There is one doctor for every 1500
 people and one hospital bed for every 115 people.
 Government health insurance programs cover all Barbadians.
 The government is attempting to meet shelter needs
 through its low-cost housing program. Overall, Barbadians
 are well-housed. Land ownership, however, is highly
 concentrated, with 10 percent of the population owning
 over 95 percent of the total.
 The government has devoted over 60 percent of its
 operating budget and almost 30 percent of its capital
 budget to the fulfillment of vital needs. It also contri-
 butes to the direct provision of essential goods and
 services through its involvement in statutory boards
 and corporations. These include the Barbados Marketing
 Corporation, which guarantees distribution of agricultural
 products at reasonable prices; the Public Assistance
 Board, which provides for the indigent; and the Child
 Care Board.
 3.   Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 The constitution guarantees these freedoms, and they
 are honored in practice. The two regular newspapers
 and cable radio services function independently of the
 government. Government ownership and operation of the
 Caribbean Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) radio and tele-
 vision service, which is modeled after the BBC, leaves
 the government open to charges of interference in the
 media, but these charges are rare.
 b.   Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration and Repatriation
 There are no impediments to free movement of citizens
 or legal residents within or without Barbados. The
 constitution guarantees the right to move freely through-
 out the country, to reside anywhere in Barbados, to
 enter and leave Barbados, and to be exempt from expulsion.
 Barbados has had an insignificant number of refugees
 and requests for asylum. These are handled on a case-
 
 
 346
 by-case basis. The government has recently begun
 an examination of its refugee and asylum policy.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 There are no impediments to participation in the politi-
 cal process. There is no discrimination based on
 race or sex. Labor unions function freely and are
 active politically; they participate in the political
 process and constitute the power base of the two major
 political parties. Barbados is a signatory to the
 Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimi-
 nation Against Women adopted by the General Assembly
 of the United Nations on December 18, 1979. There
 is no legislation that discriminates against women
 and they are active in all aspects of national life.
 One cabinet member is a woman and women are well-repre-
 sented at all levels in both the public and private
 sectors.
 4.   Government Attitude and Record Regarding Interna-
 tional and Non-governmental Investigation of
 Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 There have been no reports of human rights violations
 in Barbados nor requests by human rights groups either
 within or without the country to investigate allegations.
 Barbados favors strengthening the human rights machinery
 of the United Nations and the Organization of American
 States. The government favors more investigations
 of alleged violations of human rights in other countries
 and increased use of fact-finding or observer teams
 to monitor controversial political and electoral situa-
 tions.
