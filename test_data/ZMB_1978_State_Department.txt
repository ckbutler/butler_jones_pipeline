 ZAMBIA
 Zambia is a one-party state with a strong presidency
 and extensive constitutional guarantees of human
 rights. The continuing state of emergency, established
 by the Government because of the armed struggles for
 majority rule and self-determination in neighboring
 Rhodesia and Namibia, has legally suspended these
 guarantees. However, in practice, their observance has
 not been seriously impaired.
 1.   Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a.   Torture
 The Department of State has no evidence that torture is
 practiced by the Zambian authorities, although beatings
 and other maltreatment were alleged in the case of
 Rhodesian nationalists detained following a period of
 factional violence in 1975.
 b.   Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punish-
 ment is not practiced to our knowledge in Zambia.
 However, Zambian prisons are crowded and unsani-
 tary; Health care for prisoners is not always ade-
 quate, although it is available in emergencies.
 c.   Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 Under the State of Emergency which is considered
 to have been in effect since independence in 1964,
 the President of Zambia has wide discretion to detain
 or restrict the movements of individuals. Those so
 detained enjoy certain rights, among them the right to
 receive notice of the reason for detention, publication
 of the fact of detention, access to counsel and the
 right to seek judicial review of the detention order
 (200)
 
 
 201
 after one year. However, habeas corpus is not avail-
 able to persons detained under presidential order and
 the detaining authority is not obliged to accept the
 recommendations of the Judicial Review Tribunal.
 The Zambian courts have consistently upheld the presi-
 dential detention authority.
 The President's detention powers have been used in
 recent years against political opponents, Rhodesian
 nationalists and dissident Namibians, common criminals,
 striking university students and professors, and
 violators of currency control regulations. In most
 cases, detainees are either released or formally
 charged once investigation of their cases has been
 completed, a process which usually takes less than two
 weeks. The Department of State has no reliable esti-
 mate of the number of persons currently under presi-
 dential detention order, but it is probably somewhat
 below the mid-1976 estimate of 200. A few political
 dissidents have been continuously detained for several
 years.
 d.   Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The individual's right to a fair public trial is
 generally observed, although not in the case of
 presidential detainees. In cases coming to court,
 the safeguards of English common law are provided.
 Lawyers handling even sensitive political cases have
 expressed their confidence in the independence of the
 Zambian judiciary. Individuals who consider that their
 rights have been or are likely to be contravened may
 apply to the high court for redress; In 1972 several
 former political detainees collected damages for
 assault and false imprisonment. In late 1978 the
 Supreme Court heard a case brought by two prominant
 political figures against the ruling United National
 Independence Party.
 e;   Invasion of the Home
 Except in cases involving the deportation of illegal
 aliens, the sanctity of the home is observed in Zambia.

 2.   Governmental Policies Relating to the Fulfillment
 of Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care
 and Education
 In times of high copper prices, Zambia has been one of
 the more fortunate African countries, with the resources
 to provide substantial medical, educational and
 social services to the public. The Government's
 policies are heavily weighted toward social welfare
 programs, and nearly forty percent of the expediture in
 the 1978 budget was earmarked for education and health.
 Zambia's dependence on copper has meant that when the
 world price is depressed, as it has been since 1975,
 the Government's ability to provide basic services is
 impaired. Accordingly, the 1978 budget stressed the
 need to concentrate on economic stabilization and a
 reduction in government spending; expansion of social
 welfare programs is subordinated to the creation of
 producing revenue and generating employment. Since
 mid-1977 President Kaunda has put his prestige behind
 efforts to diversify the economy, with emphasis
 on developing Zambia's significant agricultural poten-
 tial.
 There is no evidence that official corruption diverts
 significant resources away from development efforts or
 from the poor majority. President Kaunda has actively
 sought to communicate his own personal honesty to
 government officials and has acted forcefully against
 violators of the public trust. In 1978, quasi-govern-
 mental officials in the agricultural sector were found
 guilty of embezzlement and sentenced to prison.
 3.   Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Includ-
 ing:
 a.   Freedom of Thought, Speech, Press, Religion
 and Assembly
 Freedom of thought, expression and Assembly are theo-
 retically circumscribed by the constitutional ban on
 all political activity outside the one-party structure
 
 
 203
 (see Section 3c below). Nevertheless, more freedom
 is permitted in practice than the constitutional
 ban allows. For example, the press regularly reports
 criticism of governmental policies expressed in the
 National Parliament and by the general public.
 Although both Lusaka newspapers are owned by political
 entities, one by the Government and the other by the
 sole legal political party, "constructive" media
 criticism of government performance is permitted.
 Criticism by both papers was sharp and widespread the
 past year, particularly in reference to the Govern-
 ment's economic policies. However, criticism of the
 Head of State and of the basic national philosophy,
 described as Humanism, is not allowed. Criticism of
 the President is punishable by fine or imprison-
 ment; there were no cases of such punishment in 1978.
 Censorship of foreign publications exists but is
 not stringent.
 Freedom of religion is constitutionally guaranteed and
 strongly supported by President Kaunda, except with
 regard to the Lumpa sect, which was banned in 1964
 following a .series of bloody anti-government riots. No
 systematic persecution of Jehovah's Witnessess has been
 reported, although Zambian witnesses have been subject
 to considerable public criticism by political leaders
 and localized harassment has occurred.
 All labor unions come under the Zambia Council of Trade
 Unions, a militant organization whose member unions
 take a strong stand in defense of workers' interests.
 The Council operates under government supervision but
 has shown over the years that it is not necessarily
 responsive to government direction.
 Women are active in both the party and the Government
 and hold high level positions. They are well repre-
 sented in the professions and at the University.
 b. Freedom of Movement within the Country, Foreign
 Travel and Emigration
 
 
 204
 As noted above, the President may, under his emergency
 powers, restrict the movements of individuals within
 Zambia. The Government also reserves the right to
 refuse or withdraw passports as a means of preventing
 foreign travel by individuals whose activities abroad
 are considered inimical to Zambia. Freedom to emi-
 grate, however, has not been impaired by the Govern-
 ment.
 c.   Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Under the 1973 Constitution, the United National
 Independence Party (UNIP) is designated the sole legal
 party in Zambia. Candidates for political office at
 any level must be members of UNIP and are subject to
 "vetting" for suitability by higher party authority.
 This system is described by the Zambian leadership as
 "one-party participatory democracy." The Government
 maintains that competition within the one-party frame-
 work, including elections with universal suffrage in
 which secrecy of the ballot is protected, gives ade-
 quate expression to the will of the citizenry.
 In 1971 Simon Kapwepwe, a former close associate
 of President Kaunda, broke away from UNIP to form
 the United Progressive Party (UPP). The UPP was banned
 and Kapwepwe detained in February 1972, when President
 Kaunda announced that Zambia would become a one-party
 state. Kapwepwe and several of his senior followers
 rejoined UNIP in September 1977. In late summer of
 1978, Kapwepwe and two other persons announced their
 candidacy for the presidency of UNIP. Kapwepwe's
 candidacy was thwarted by the UNIP Party General
 Conference's adoption of an amendment to the Party
 constitution which restricted candidacies to those
 with five years of party membership. As expected,
 President Kaunda was renominated at the same General
 Conference and thus stood as the sole candidate in the
 December national elections for President. In that
 election, seventy percent of the eligible voters
 participated and President Kaunda was returned to
 office by a margin of four to one.

 4.     Government Attitude and Record Regarding Inter-
 national and Non-Governmental Investigation of
 Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 To the knowledge of the Department of State in recent
 years there have been no requests for outside investi-
 gations of alleged violations of human rights in
 Zambia. In its 1977 Annual Report, Amnesty Interna-
 tional criticized Zambia for detaining Rhodesian and
 Namibian dissidents. The Government has not responded
 publicly to Amnesty International's criticism.
