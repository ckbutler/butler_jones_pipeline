 CANADA
 Canada is a constitutional monarchy with a bilingual federal
 system, parliamentary form of government, and a strong demo-
 cratic tradition. Under Canadas decentralized federal
 structure, specific governmental responsibilities are reserved
 either to the provinces or to the Federal Government. Each has
 substantial autonomy in its respective areas of competence.
 The multiparty system provides for democratically elected
 representatives at local, provincial, and Federal levels by
 universal suffrage.
 Respect for fundamental human rights in Canada is based on the
 well-established principle of the rule of law. It is entrenched
 in the Constitution and expressed in numerous Federal and pro-
 vincial laws which reflect Canadian political, cultural, and
 social practices. On the Federal level, statutes such as the
 Canadian Bill of Rights and the Human Rights Act prohibit dis-
 criminatory practices in a broad range of social and economic
 activities and protect fundamental political and legal civil
 liberties. The Saskatchewan and Alberta Bills of Rights and
 the Quebec Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms are represent-
 ative of similar provincial safeguards.
 In 1982, Canada revised its Constitution and added a Charter of
 Rights and Freedoms. The Charter of Rights and Freedoms guaran-
 tees fundamental rights to everyone including "(a) freedom of
 conscience and religion; (b) freedom of thought, belief, opinion
 and expressions including freedom of the press and other media
 of communication; and (c) freedom of peaceful assembly and of
 association." The Constitution also guarantees legal and
 language rights as well as the right to vote and to travel
 freely. It provides for judicial review of actions taken in
 these areas by the Federal Parliament or provinci.i 1.9isla-
 tures.
 Although its long-range impact is yet to be determined, the
 Charter generally is regarded as fulfilling its promise to
 protect and extend essential rights and liberties. There is
 some disquiet and considerable public discussion, however, over
 the potential challenge to the principle of parliamentary
 sovereignty posed by the enhanced role of the courts which
 enfoi# .enL of the Charter will entail.
 Several statutes also exist which permit under special circum-
 stances some abridgments of human rights guarantees. These
 rights are "subject only to such reasonable limits prescribed
 by law as can be demonstrably justified in a free and demo-
 cratic society." The Parliament or provincial legislatures may
 enact limited exceptions to certain Charter pruvibiviib for up
 to five years (renewable for another five) when express decla-
 rations are made that the Act in question should operate not-
 withstanding the Charter. Otherwise, the Charter of Rights and
 Freedoms places basic human rights beyond the reach of ordinary
 legislative action. An intense public debate currently is
 taking place over proposals to revamp the security services in
 the wake of an investigation which uncovered illegal activities
 infringing on certain protected civil liberties.
 Canada maintains its historic commitment to human rights. The
 Canadian public, Parliament, and the media are quick to react
 to any real or suspected infringement on basic freedoms, not
 only in Canada but elsewhere in the world. Canada supports and
 often initiates U.N. resolutions and declarations on human
 rights. It has played a leading role in stimulating
 
 (942)
 
 
 943
 global concern for human rights abuses and in working to
 strengthen international human rights machinery. Traditionally
 a place of refuge for victims of oppression in other parts of
 the world, Canada has welcomed large numbers of refugees in
 addition to contributing substantial sums for humanitarian
 assistance.
 RESPECT FOR HU24AN RIGHTS
 Section I Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Unlawful or Arbitrary Deprivation of Life
 There was no politically motivated killing, either by the
 Government or its domestic opposition, in 1983. Political
 violence is rare in Canada. Since the demise of the Quebec
 Liberation Front more than a decade ago, the country was free
 of such activity until the attempted assassination of a Turkish
 diplomat in April 1982. Armenian terrorists who claimed credit
 for that attempt struck again in August 1982, murdering the
 Turkish military attache in Ottawa. The perpetrators have not
 yet been identified.
 b. Disappearance
 Secret arrest, clandestine detention, and politically motivated
 "disappearances" are contrary to law and do not take place in
 Canada.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Torture is contrary to Canadian tradition and law, as is cruel,
 inhuman, or degrading treatment. These principles and guaran-
 tees are respected in practice. Although prison conditions
 generally meet accepted standards, public criticism and official
 investigations have been directed to examples of poor facilities
 and overcrowding, which on occasion have prompted clashes
 between dissatisfied inmates and the authorities.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The Constitution, subject to override provisions, prohibits
 arbitrary detention and imprisonment. It also recognizes the
 right to be informed promptly of reasons for arrest or deten-
 tion, to retain counsel without delay and to be informed of
 that right, to have the validity of the detention determined by
 way of habeas corpus, and to be released if detention is not
 lawful. Accused persons are generally released pending trial
 and there are provisions for judicial review at specified
 intervals when pretrial detention does occur.
 The War Measures Act of 1914, augmented by a 1981 Federal
 Cabinet order, permits a declaration of a state of emergency
 with suspension of certain civil liberties, including detaining
 civilians, in the event of war or peacetime crisis. The 1939
 Official Secrets Act which prohibits the private possession,
 distribution, and publication of information deemed prejudicial
 to the interests of the state, provides that individuals under
 suspicion may be arrested without a warrant.
 
 
 944
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Generally, in civil as well as criminal matters, the presumption
 of innocence and the right to a public trial are fundamental
 features of the Canadian legal system. Defendants have the
 right to counsel of their choice. Although there is no provi-
 sion of general application in Federal law recognizing the right
 to legal assistance, persons charged with criminal offenses
 under Federal law may generally take advantage of provincial
 legal aid programs subsidized by the Federal Government. These
 rights and protections are respected in practice. There is
 public concern over increasing court docket backlogs which are
 causing long delays in some instances.
 The judiciary in Canada is an independent branch of government.
 Judges are appointed by either the Federal or provincial govern-
 ment, depending on the level and jurisdiction of the court.
 Secure tenure of judges and standards set by provincial law
 societies contributes to judicial independence and impartiality.
 The Official Secrets Act allows for trials under its provisions
 to be held in camera and includes presumption in favor of the
 state, although two of the three prosecutions in the last four
 years were resolved in favor of the defendants, and the one
 conviction was later overturned.
 The 1970 Federal Court Act allows a Cabinet minister to deny
 release of certain categories of information, even if necessary
 for a person~s defense in court.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Criminal Code prohibits forcible entry into real property
 in the peaceable possession of another. If a police officer,
 when not authorized to do so by law, conducts a search without
 a warrant, he becomes an intruder and is subject to legal
 penalties. The Charter of Rights and Freedoms also guarantees
 security against unreasonable search or seizure, subject to the
 exception provisions noted above.
 Upon petition of the Federal Court of Canada and with sufficient
 justification, a law enforcement official may be granted a
 "Writ of Assistance," which empowers the official with due
 cause to enter and search premises without a specific warrant.
 The writ, usually issued under the Narcotics Control Act, is
 nonspecific and openended, empowering the particular law
 enforcement officer to act without a specific warrant through-
 out his career. A moratorium on issuance of such writs was
 imposed in 1976 but some remain in force. Considerable public
 discussion has taken place on possibly altering the terms of
 reference of the writs or abolishing them altogether.
 According to official inquiries, some abuses of personal
 privacy, including surreptitious entry, and the monitoring of
 telephones and mail, have occurred in the past decade. Govern-
 ment proposals to restructure and alter the mandate of the
 security services currently are the focus of intense public
 debate.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The freedoms of speech and press are guaranteed by law. In
 
 
 945
 practice, viewpoints representing the complete political spec-
 trum are argued vigorously in newspapers and other publications
 across Canada and on the more than 2,000 publicly and privately
 owned broadcasting stations. In most radio and television
 broadcasts, the majority of the content must be of Canadian
 origin. Tax exemptions granted to a Canadian firm also adver-
 tising in Canadian media are not granted, if the firm
 advertises in foreign media aiming at a Canadian audience, thus
 discouraging the practice. Subsidized postal rates for
 Canadian publications provide them an advantage over
 foreign-owned publications printed and mailed in Canada and
 those printed abroad and brought into Canada fbr mailing. Some
 provinces maintain censor boards with authority to delete
 sexually explicit or violent material from films for
 distribution. Recent court decisions based on the new Charter
 have called into question some methods of censorship but have
 not found the practice unconstitutional in principle. In the
 political sphere, opposition party critiques of official policy
 are widely reported and, during parliamentary sessions, daily
 debates and question periods are televised nationwide. A
 similar practice is followed by some provinces.
 In July 1983, a Freedom of Information Act came into force,
 establishing procedures for public access to certain government
 records. For the most part the measure has been widely wel-
 comed, but there is some criticism of the exemption authority,
 which accords the Government substantial discretion to prevent
 release of information.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Canadian Constitution guarantees freedom of peaceful
 assembly and association subject to legislative enactment of
 limited exceptions under the "reasonable limits" clause.
 Associations representing a full range of political opinion may
 organize and espouse their views freely.
 Canadian labor unions enjoy notably wide freedom of action and
 represent 31.4 percent of the work force, playing an important
 role in society and the economy. Canadian law recognizes the
 right of labor in both the public and private sector to orga-
 nize, associate freely, bargain collectively, and strike.
 These rights are well established and recognized in practice,
 although citing economic circumstances, the Federal Government
 and several provinces have passed legislation which limits
 somewhat the collective bargaining rights of public sector
 employees. Federal and provincial legislation proscribe
 discrimination in union membership recruitment and employee
 hiring.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 The Constitution recognizes the fundamental freedom of consci-
 ence and religion. There is no national religion. The major
 religious groups are Roman Catholic, United (a union of several
 Protestant groups), Anglican, and Jewish. Others, notably
 Islam, Hinduism, Buddhism, and Sikhism, have been introduced by
 more recent immigrants. All faiths enjoy freedom of worship
 and religious expression.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel,
 Emigration, and Repatriation
 Canadian citizens and permanent residents have the constitu-
 tional right of free movement in Canada; they can live and work
 
 
 946
 in any province. The Constitution also protects the right of
 every citizen to enter, remain in. and leave the country. How-
 ever, Federal officials have expressed concern over provincial
 laws which inhibit nonresidents of a province from working or
 owning land, and which create other barriers to the free flow
 of capital, labor, and services throughout the Canadian economy.
 The Charter of Rights and Freedoms in the new Constitution
 strengthens the right of citizens and permanent residents to
 establish residence in any province and to take up employment
 there. It mandates equality of treatment in employment,
 subject to exceptions for provincial "affirmative action"
 programs for socially and economically disadvantaged groups.
 This adjustment will require accommodation of provincial and
 Federal responsibilities and authority and may require
 adjudication by the courts.
 Canada is a principal haven for refugees and has taken a major
 role in focusing international attention on the causes of
 refugee problems, particularly when widespread violations of
 human rights have contributed to mass population movements.
 Private citizens and voluntary organizations play a large part
 in Canadian refugee programs alongside government-supported
 activities. These new arrivals enjoy virtually all rights and
 privileges of Canadians and, after a period in permanent
 resident status, may apply for citizenship and thereby obtain
 the right to vote.
 Section 3  Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to
 Change Their Government
 Legislative power at the Federal level is vested in the House of
 Commons, whose members are elected by secret ballot through
 universal suffrage of adult Canadian citizens, and in an appoint-
 ed Senate. Elections for the 282 single-member constituencies
 must be held at least every five years, and participation rates
 are high. Canadians of all ethnic groups have complete freedom
 to join and participate actively in the political process. Three
 independent and politically diverse parties are represented in
 the House of Commons and several others function at the provincial
 level. All provinces and territories have similar freely elected
 legislatures.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Canada has vigorously supported efforts to increase the authority
 of international bodies to investigate and deal with human rights
 abuses. In fact, Canadian initiatives have been instrumental in
 achieving major advances at recent sessions of the U.N.
 Commission on Human Rights.
 Numerous governmental and private mechanisms and institutions
 exist in Canada for monitoring domestic human rights practices.
 The Canadian Human Rights Commission, established under the 1977
 Human Rights Act, is charged with investigating and resolving
 complaints of discrimination in government and business activi-
 ties under Federal jurisdiction, and combating discrimination
 through information, education, and research. The Commission
 accepted 397 formal complaints in 1983.
 In March 1983, the Canadian Human Rights Act was further amended
 to improve protection of disabled persons and women and to
 tighten provisions against harassment. The Commission continues
 
 
 947
 to advocate changes in the Unemployment Insurance Act and legis-
 lation affecting indigenous peoples as well as deletion of man-
 datory retirement provisions from the Human Rights Act. Each
 province maintains a similar Human Rights Commission, although
 British Columbia has considered a controversial proposal to
 replace its commission with a different arrangement. There is
 growing concern that these commissions are becoming overburdened
 and that individuals face long delays for resolution of com-
 plaints.
 Since 1975, a Federal-provincial committee of officials
 responsible for human rights has been in existence to provide a
 forum for intergovernmental discussion on matters related to
 human rights in Canada. Canadas Commissioner of Official
 Languages reviews public complaints over violations in statutory
 language rights which guarantee Canadians the right to deal with
 Federal institutions in either French or English.
 Non-governmental human rights organizations and interest groups
 are also active in maintaining high public concern over human
 rights issues in Canada and abroad. The prominent role occupied
 by human rights considerations in Canadas external relations
 was reinforced in the April 1983 Annual Conference on Foreign
 Policy and Human Rights, sponsored by the Canadian Human Rights
 Foundation and attended by senior government officials and
 private experts from across the country and abroad.
 Amnesty International does not discuss Canada in its 1983 Report.
 Freedom House rates it "free.*
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 Food, shelter, health care, and education are available to all
 Canadians regardless of race, religion, sex, ethnic background,
 or political opinion. The Canadian Government has demonstrated
 a strong commitment to improving the lot of the poor. The
 Federal and provincial governments administer extensive social
 welfare programs for which all Canadians qualify, regardless of
 income. An equalization system provides for transfers of revenue
 from the more prosperous provinces to those which are relatively
 less well-off. Education is free up to grade 13, and all
 Canadians are covered by a national medical and health insurance
 program.
 Women are increasingly active in Canadian political life. They
 participate fully in political parties and are represented in
 Parliament and provincial legislatures, although not in numbers
 proportionate to the population in all cases.
 A Cabinet minister is charged specifically with responsibility
 for the status of women. A Federal Advisory Council on the
 Status of Women, consisting of women with distinguished records
 in business, government, and social service, advises the Minister
 of Womens Affairs on measures to promote sexual equality within
 the public service and in Federal legislation. Canada has rati-
 fied the U.N. Convention Prohibiting All Forms of Discrimination
 Against Women, and the new Charter of Rights and Freedoms con-
 tains a clause specifying that all its provisions pertain equally
 to men and women.
 Much emphasis has been placed on the fostering of a bilingual
 multicultural society in which all may enjoy freedom from
 discrimination while maintaining distinct cultural identities
 with Canada. A Minister for Multiculturalism is responsible
 specifically for encouraging the preservation of ethnic groups!
 heritage and protecting the cultural mosaic of Canadian society.
 
 
 948
 Quebec has repeatedly invoked the "reasonable limits" clauses of
 the Federal Charter in an effort to insure that the provinces
 own laws and Bill of Rights take precedence. The eight-year old
 Quebec Charter of Rights and Liberties was amended effective
 October 1, 1983, to include protections against double jeopardy
 and discrimination or harassment because of sex or age. The
 changes also impose limits on information that employers may
 require of potential employees and establish the right of an
 accused to be informed promptly of a charge.
 The Quebec Government retains the power to suspend the Provincial
 Charterts extensive list of rights and liberties. In February
 1983, the Quebec Legislature, reacting to striking teachers!
 unions which were on strike because of severe cutbacks in con-
 tracts imposed earlier by the provincial government, passed a
 back-to-work law providing for potentially heavy penalties and
 suspending the teachers, recourse to the Provincial Charter of
 Rights. Faced with these severe threats, the teachers returned
 to work after three weeks. The Quebec Governments action
 received criticism from human rights and union groups as well as
 bar associations throughout Canada.
 Associations of native peoples have laid formal claim to large
 areas of Canada, and agreements applying to two areas were
 reached in 1975 and 1978. After extensive study, the Federal
 Government, in late 1981, reaffirmed its commitment to negoti-
 ating settlements of claims based on aboriginal titles relating
 to traditional use and occupancy of land. The Government is
 offering to extend new benefits and rights in exchange for those
 based on traditional interests. It proved impossible to resolve
 this issue during the constitutional negotiations, so the new
 Constitution specifically "recognized the existing aboriginal
 and treaty rights of the aboriginal peoples of Canada" without
 going into further detail. Futhermore, the Charter of Rights
 and Freedoms provides that its guarantees recognize aboriginal
 rights and freedoms previously recognized or acquired in land
 claims settlements. A constitutional conference which included
 representatives of aboriginal peoples was held in March 1983 to
 deal with the question of which native rights should be
 consititutionally protected. More such meetings are scheduled.
 According to a report of the Department of Indian and Northern
 Affairs, native peoples as a group have less access to social
 benefits provided by the Government, and suffer traditional
 social problems more deeply than the mainstream of the popula-
 tion. Infant mortality rates are twice, and suicide rates three
 times, the national average. Life expectancy is 10 years below
 the national norm and violent death occurs from four to five
 times more frequently than in the country as a whole. Indians
 occupy penal institutions in numbers more than three times their
 proportion of the population, and juvenile delinquency is also
 around three times the national average. Welfare payments are
 the main source of income for just over half the Indian popula-
 tion, which has more than doubled since 1951. Indians obtained
 the franchise in Federal elections in 1960 and, during the 1950,s
 and 1960:s, in the provinces as well. As mentioned above, the
 Federal Government and the provinces, in concert with the
 Indians, are acting to redress the situation through a series
 of measures, some of which may alter the constitutional status
 of Canada~s native peoples. The Federal budget for Indian
 affairs was approximately $820 million in fiscal year 1982, one-
 half of which was administered by the Indians themselves.
 A section of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, due to take
 effect in 1985 and subject to legislative override provisions,
 
 
 949
 guarantees equal benefits and protection of the law without
 discrimination based on race, national or ethnic origin, color,
 religion, sex, age, or mental or physical disability. The delay
 until 1985 allows the Federal and provincial governments time to
 review and adjust existing practices and statutes.
 Canadas per capita gross national product in 1981 was 11,230
 compared with $10,131 in 1980. The population of 24,882,000
 (1983 figures) grew by one percent in 1983. In 1983, the infant
 mortality rate was 9.60 per 1,000 births, and life expectancy at
 birth (1980 statistics) was 74.23 years. According to recent
 figures, 98.5 percent of the population has access to safe water
 (99.8 percent in urban areas, 93.2 percent in rural), and the
 ratio of calorie supply available for consumption relative to
 nutritional requirements was 127.24 percent.
