 MACAU
 Macau's current status is unique; this small piece of land,
 only 6 miles square, located near Hong Kong, is recognized by
 both China and Portugal as Chinese territory operating under
 Portuguese administration. The "Organic Statute" of 1976,
 which serves as Macau's Constitution, grants it considerable
 administrative, economic, financial, and legislative
 autonomy. Macau's Governor, who holds expansive powers under
 the Statute, is appointed by the Portuguese President
 following local consultation.
 Legislative power is shared by the Portuguese Government and
 the territory's legislative assembly. Portuguese metropolitan
 law serves as the basis for the legal system, which features
 Portuguese as the official language, an independent judiciary,
 and jury trials. The fundamental human rights contained in
 the Portuguese Constitution apply also in Macau. The small
 police f6rce is firmly under the control of the civilian
 authorities.
 Macau's private enterprise economy is expected to grow about
 3 percent in 1990. This growth is fueled by legalized
 gambling, which has produced a thriving tourist industry, and
 by the export of textiles and other light industrial products,
 principally toys. With a population of less than half a
 million people, Macau has a per capita gross domestic product
 of over $6,300.
 Under the agreement reached between the Portuguese and Chinese
 Governments in 1987, Macau will become a Special Administrative
 Region (SAR) of China on December 20, 1999-. Macau's current
 social, economic, and legal systems are supposed to remain
 basically unchanged during the first 50 years of the SAR's
 existence.
 Efforts are under way, in the form of follow-up diplomatic
 negotiations and the drafting of Macau's future constitution
 (Basic Law), to conclude the legal and other arrangements
 necessary to effect the transition to Chinese rule. Actions
 taken by Chinese authorities against the prodemocracy movement
 on the mainland have negatively affected local confidence,
 prompting concern over the future effectiveness of such
 arrangements in safeguarding existing rights and freedoms.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom fromi
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing-
 There were no indications of such abuses being condoned or
 practiced by government authorities.
 b. Disappearance
 The authorities do not practice or condone secret arrests or
 clandestine confinements.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Such abuses are prohibited by law. There were no reports that
 they were either practiced or condoned by the Government.

 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Legal prohibitions exist and are honored. The examining
 judge, who conducts the pretrial inquiry in criminal cases,
 has wide powers to collect evidence, to order or dismiss
 indictments, to validate and maintain the detention of
 suspects, and to determine whether to release accused
 persons. The evidence is examined by the accused's counsel.
 If the judge is not convinced that the evidence is fully
 adequate, he can dismiss the accused, and the trial will not
 take place. Exile is not practiced.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Fair trial is gaaranteed and practiced. The courts, which are
 independent bodies subject only to the law, administer
 justice. All are courts of first instance and are integrated
 into the Portugese judicial system. Juries determine
 questions of fact in serious criminal cases. Decisions of the
 Macau courts are appealable to the superior Portugese courts,
 which are empowered to uphold, amend, or reverse the decision
 of lower courts or to order a new trial except where
 administrative acts are declared invalid.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Macau currently has in effect laws ensuring the inviolability
 of the home and of communication, the right of ownership of
 private property and of-enterprises, and the freedom to marry
 and raise a family. There is no indication of any abuses
 either condoned or practiced by the government authorities.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Independent or critical opinions receive consistent airing in
 the mass media, public forums, and by public associations.
 Newspapers and television stations are privately owned. The
 academic community is free to express its views,
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Legal guarantees exist and are observed in practice. With
 full cooperation of the local authorities, fully half the
 population participated in multiple, peaceful demonstrations
 in 1989 in support of the mainland prodemocracy movement.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Macau is a multireligious, predominantly Buddhist-society.
 Other religions may and do exist and practice freely.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Movement is subject neither to arbitrary nor discriminatory
 limitation.
 The Government' official policy since 1982 has been to guide
 all Vietnamese boat people arriving in Macau waters into or
 near' Hong Kong territorial waters. While the Hong Kong
 Government does not endorse this practice and would like Macau
 to provide first asylum for Vietnamese, no formal protest has

 MACAU
 been lodged. The Government closed its only refugee center in
 December and has integrated its 200 former residents into the
 community. The center had been run as an open camp with
 virtually all able-bodied adults employed in the local economy.
 In August the Macau Government announced plans to issue
 provisional residency permits to about 27,000 illegal Chinese
 immigrants. They will be issued permanent residency permits
 after staying in Macau for an as yet unspecified period. In
 April, when 4,200 illegal immigrant mothers with children born
 in Macau became eligible for a limited amnesty, the
 registration process turned into a riot when the police were
 caught off guard by more than 50,000 illegal immigrants from ï¿½
 China who tried to storm the registration center.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Citizens have only a limited ability to change their
 government. Representative government in Macau is limited.
 The 17-member legislative assembly is an organizational hybrid
 in which 6 members are chosen in universal, direct elections,
 an additional 6 are indirectly elected by local community
 interests, and the remaining 5 members are appointed by the
 Governor. The Consultative Council, an advisory group to the
 Governor, also provides some measure of popular representation.
 The Macau Government, by tradition, also consults informally
 on a regular basis with local business and cultural leaders.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 There have been no reports that any international or
 nongovernmental body has made any request to carry out human
 rights investigations in Macau.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Freedom from discrimination in these areas is guaranteed by
 law. Because Macau's governmental and legal systems place a
 premium on knowledge of the Portuguese language and
 metropolitan law, about 60 percent of the approximately 130
 senior government officials come from Portugal. Among the 700
 people in the government's professional grades, about half
 come from Portugal. Most of the other middle- and
 upper-ranking civil servants are Macanese. Legislation is now
 being drafted in both Chinese and Portuguese; and both
 languages have equal status in the Legislative Assembly and
 Consultative Council;
 By tradition and custom, women play a minor role in local
 political life. They are becoming more active and visible in
 business and government, and some enjoy considerable influence
 and responsibility in these areas. Reported cases of violence
 against women are not common. For cases that are reported,
 Macau's criminal statutes prohibiting domestic violence are
 enforced and violators are prosecuted. Abuses are reported by
 police and doctors to the Social Welfare Department, which
 investigates them. If hospital treatment is required, a
 medical social worker counsels the victim and informs her
 about social welfare services. Until their complaints are
 resolved, battered women may be placed in public housing, but
 no facilities are reserved especially for them.

 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Macau labor law recognizes the right and freedom of workers to
 form and join trade unions and to strike. The Government
 neither impedes the formation of trade unions nor
 discriminates against union members. Nonetheless, local trade
 union activities, including the selection of union leadership,
 are heavily influenced or directly controlled by the interests
 of'the People's Republic of China, which places emphasis on
 maintaining Macau's economic and political stability with
 minimum disruptions in the work force.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 Unions tend to resemble local traditional neighborhood
 associations, promoting social and cultural activities rather
 than issues relating to the workplace. Local custom,
 moreover, favors employment without the benefit of written
 labor contracts, the exception being the importation of labor
 from China which is under contract. Reflecting the mainland
 Chinese influence, unions traditionally have not attempted to
 engage in collective bargaining. Accordingly, while the Macau
 Government does not impede or discourage collective
 bargaining, there are no government mechanisms to promote
 voluntary negotiations. Some workers complain that they do
 not dare speak out against unfair practices for fear of losing
 their jobs. There are no export processing zones in Macau.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Compulsory labor is illegal and does not exist.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 Minors under the age of 14 are forbidden legally to work, but
 the law is not rigorously enforced, and child labor is common
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 Existing labor legislation provides for a 48-hour workweek,
 (regularly 8 hours per day, but no more than 10.5 hours per
 day), overtime, annual leave, medical and maternity care, and
 employee compensation insurance. The Labor Department is
 responsible for processing complaints. However, government
 enforcement of the labor laws appears to be lax at times,
 partly owing to limited fiscal resources and personnel, but
 also as a matter of policy. Some workers complain that
 workers receive no assistance from the Government in disputes
 between workers and factories.
 In the absence of any statutory minimum wage or publicly
 administered social security program, some large companies
 have provided private welfare and security packages. Calls
 for labor reform, medical insurance, a social security system,
 and increases in employee compensation figure regularly in
 political campaign platforms. To offset a current labor
 shortage, the Macau Government allows the importation of labor
 from China under contract, while at the same time imposing
 heavy fines on employers harboring illegal immigrants. The
 number of imported workers probably totals between 1,500 and
 3,000 workers out of an estimated work force of 195,000.
