 LEBANON
 Formally, Lebanon is a constitutional democracy with a directly
 elected, unicameral Parliament which chooses the President.
 Political power is divided on the basis of a formal
 Constitution and in accordance with the unwritten,
 confessionally-based National Pact of 1943, which provides for
 a Maronite Christian President, a Sunni Muslim Prime Minister,
 and a Shi'ite Muslim Speaker of Parliament. The National Pact
 also provides for the proportional allocation of government
 positions among various religious groups on the basis of the
 1932 national census.
 Ten years of war, however, have drastically reduced the
 authority of the central Government and its ability to
 safeguard human rights and have seriously undermined the.
 country's democratic institutions. Unofficial militias have
 seized control of much of the country, where they, in effect,
 govern the civilian population and enforce their own version of
 justice without regard to the central Government or legal
 norms. Moreover, the presence of foreign forces has greatly
 diminished those areas under government authority. Although
 Israel withdrew the bulk of its forces from South Lebanon
 during 1985, the Lebanese Government has yet to extend
 effective authority to that region. Through the presence of an
 estimated 30,000 troops, Syria continues to control large parts
 of northern Lebanon as well as much of the Biqa' Valley. Even
 in those few areas of Lebanon under nominal central government
 control, the authority of the State and its security services
 does not go unquestioned.
 Already seriously disrupted by a decade of war, Lebanon's free
 enterprise economy deteriorated even further in 1985. Business
 confidence dwindled, new investment stagnated, and remittances
 from Lebanese abroad dropped to the lowest level since 1975.
 The value of the Lebanese pound plummeted, causing a serious
 decline in the standard of living of most Lebanese.
 The year 1985 brought no overall improvement in the human
 rights situation. As in previous years, major battles fought
 in densely populated areas intentionally or unintentionally
 cost the lives of hundreds of civilians and displaced thousands
 of others. Noncombatants far from the fighting have also been
 the targets of violence, such as terrorist bombings, random
 shellings, assassinations, and abductions. Freedom of movement
 between East and West Beirut and to much of the country was
 severely limited.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 Rival factions routinely kill for political motives. Such
 killing has not been restricted to soldiers and militiamen; it
 has also been used frequently against noncombatants. Both
 indiscriminate and carefully planned attacks against civilian
 targets continued to occur throughout 1985, killing hundreds
 and wounding, endangering, and displacing thousands. While
 forces outside of government control were responsible for most
 of these killings, opponents of the Lebanese Government charge
 that security forces and the Lebanese Army also carried out
 such attacks during the past year.
 
 
 1299
 LEBANON
 Such political killing has resulted from both conventional
 warfare and terrorist attacks. In 1985, residential areas in
 greater Beirut, Sidon, and elsewhere in South Lebanon were
 frequently the target of random shelling, whose purpose often
 appears to have been to kill or intimidate civilians.
 Terrorist attacks in the form of massive car bombs
 indiscriminately killed several hundred civilians in East and
 West Beirut, Tripoli, the Biqa' Valley, and South Lebanon. In
 all instances, these explosions took place in neighborhoods or
 villages in which one confessional group predominates, and thus
 appear to have been aimed against that group. The car bombs
 were usually detonated in crowded areas in order to maximize
 casualties.
 The cycle of violence in South Lebanon intensified in early
 1985 but gradually diminished as Israel began to withdraw its
 forces. Before and during the withdrawal, Israeli and
 Israeli-backed forces raided a number of villages in South
 Lebanon to apprehend persons suspected of carrying out attacks
 against them. An undetermined number of these persons were
 killed or arrested. By late 1985, the cycle of attacks and
 counterattacks had subsided but not ended.
 In the fall of 1985, Syrian artillery shelled Tripoli,
 intervening in a fight between local militias and siding with
 forces opposed to the fundamentalist Islamic Unity Movement
 (Tawhiid) which controlled the city. In an apparent effort to
 break the will of Tripoli's besieged defenders, Syrian
 artillery units forced the closing of the port and
 systematically destroyed selected portions of the city,
 resulting in an undetermined loss of life. The role of Syrian
 infantry in the battle remains unclear, although Syrian ground
 forces later policed the subsequent cease-fire in Tripoli.
 Heavy fighting also occurred among other groups, most notably
 between Lebanese Shi'a and Palestinians in and around the
 refugee camps in West Beirut. These clashes resulted in
 several hundred deaths on each side, including both militiamen
 and civilians.
 In addition to random acts against civilians, there have been
 numerous assassination attempts against prominent political and
 religious figures. These assassination attempts took the form
 of ambushes, rocket attacks on homes, and car bombings.
 Attacks on foreign diplomats in Beirut continued in 1985. One
 diplomat, a Soviet, was killed. In June, members of the
 Lebanese Shi'ite militia Hizballah hijacked a TWA airliner and
 held its passengers hostage. The hijackers murdered one
 American, and seriously endangered the lives of the other
 hostages. Finally, at year's end, two Lebanese Jews, part of a
 group of six kidnaped earlier in the year, were killed.
 Responsibility for the killings was claimed by a hitherto
 unknown group, Organization of the Oppressed on Earth.
 b. Disappearance
 Thousands of Lebanon's inhabitants have disappeared since the
 beginning of the war in 1975. Private militias and foreign
 forces, rather than official Lebanese security services, appear
 to be responsible for most bf these kidnappings. The victims
 were abducted primarily by militiamen at roadblocks or in
 ambushes, and many were probably summarily executed. Most of
 these personq remain unaccounted for, but occasional hostage
 exchanges and releases do occur.
 
 
 1300
 LEBANON
 During 1985, politically motivated kidnappings continued
 unabated. Abductions were particularly prevalent in West
 Beirut and along the so-called Green Line, which divides
 predominantly Christian East Beirut from mostly Muslim West
 Beirut. Some Lebanese were kidnapped because of their
 affiliation with rival militias. Most, however, were civilians
 abducted simply on the basis of religion. The Lebanese victims
 included, for example, Muslims traveling to East Beirut,
 Christians living or working in West Beirut (including
 Christian passengers and airline employees trying to reach the
 airport in West Beirut), and six members of the small Beirut
 Jewish community. In 1985, the number of foreign diplomats,
 journalists, clergymen, academics, and others who were
 kidnapped in West Beirut escalated. A few were eventually
 released, but over 10 U.S., French, and British nationals
 remain hostage.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Overwhelmed by the presence of private militias and foreign
 forces, the official Lebanese security services control so
 little territory that relatively few allegations of torture are
 made against them. In its report, "Torture in the Eighties,"
 Amnesty International noted that it had received allegations of
 "some cases of torture" in Lebanon.
 Almost no reliable information is available on the treatment of
 prisoners held by Lebanese militias, Syrian occupying forces,
 the Israeli-sponsored Army of South Lebanon, or Palestinians.
 Allegations of brutal treatment abound, but it is impossible to
 determine to what extent these allegations, which are often
 leveled by archenemies, reflect actual practices.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Under Lebanese law, a suspect must be arraigned before an
 accusation committee (a panel of three judges) and the
 prosecutor within 48 hours, but government prosecutors
 sometimes hold suspects indefinitely for interrogation without
 reference to a judge. Every prisoner has the right to legal
 counsel, but there is no public defender's office. Bail is
 permitted in most cases.
 No militia or foreign occupying force observes the legal
 safeguards which the Government is committed to apply in arrest
 cases. In general, persons arrested by these groups are denied
 access to the judicial system and to due legal process.
 Various militias detain individuals arbitrarily for indefinite
 periods, often to be exchanged for persons held by rival
 militias. Such detainees, are frequently held incommunicado.
 In addition to politically motivated abductions, some militias
 presume to enforce law and order in regions under their
 control, arresting, imprisoning and, in at least one instance,
 executing individuals on purely criminal charges.
 In 1985, representatives of the International Committee of the
 Red Cross (ICRC) continued to visit Lebanese and Palestinian
 detainees held in several Israeli prison camps in South
 Lebanon. The Israelis dismantled these camps as they withdrew
 from Lebanon. Several hundred prisoners were transferred from
 Ansar, Lebanon, to Atlit, Israel, during this withdrawal. All
 were released by September. The Army of South Lebanon, an
 Israeli-backed militia, maintains a detention center in Khiyam,
 
 
</pre>
<pre>
 1301
 LEBANON
 which neutral observers have not been allowed to visit.
 The Government does not, as a rule, arrest or exile its
 political opponents. Fear of assassination by political rivals
 has, however, driven several prominent Lebanese into voluntary
 exile, and the general decline in public security has
 stimulated the emigration of many Lebanese.
 The Government does not resort to forced labor. In the present
 anarchy, however, militias have forced workers, especially
 immigrant laborers, to perform unpaid duties such as filling
 sand bags for use in building defenses against attack. Such
 forced labor typically ends when tensions lessen.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Lebanese law, practice, and custom provide the right to a fair
 public trial. A decade of war, however, has disrupted the
 judicial process, and many cases remain unadjudicated. Trial
 delays result, for example, from the difficulty of conducting
 investigations when most of the country remains beyond
 effective government control, from a shortage of judges, and,
 most importantly, from the general breakdown in security.
 Although Lebanese police and courts are present throughout the
 country, the disposition of criminal cases ultimately depends
 on the group in power locally. For example, militias
 frequently intervene to protect their supporters from detention
 and prosecution.
 The Government does not sentence persons to imprisonment for
 essentially political beliefs or acts. As noted above,
 however, militias frequently arrest and imprison members of
 opposing political and military groups.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Government has generally evinced no interest in controlling
 personal life. The law requires the Government to obtain the
 equivalent of a warrant before entering homes, except when the
 Lebanese Army is pursuing an armed attacker.
 Rights of privacy, however, have been frequently violated in
 the course of military operations mounted by the army,
 militias, and foreign forces in Lebanon. All of these groups
 have attempted to gather intelligence on their adversaries,
 including by informer networks and telephone monitoring.
 In 1985, armed groups in many sections of the country violated
 the sanctity of the home by deliberately shelling residential
 areas, destroying houses, and killing and wounding their
 occupants. During the first part of the year, withdrawing
 Israeli forces in South Lebanon demolished the houses of
 numerous persons suspected of anti-Israeli activities.
 Shelling and sniping reportedly continues in those areas of
 South Lebanon still under the control of the Israeli Armed
 Forces and the Israeli-backed Army of South Lebanon. In April
 and May, Muslim militias overran predominantly Christian
 villages in the Iqlim Al-Kharrub and east of Sidon, forced
 their inhabitants to flee, and thus displaced thousands of
 families. Throughout 1985, shelling of nonmilitary targets
 occurred in the greater Beirut area, almost always in densely
 populated residential neighborhoods.
 
 
 1302
 LEBANON
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Lebanon has a strong heritage of freedom of opinion, speech,
 and press. The Government has traditionally protected the
 rights of those who have opposed government policies through
 peaceful means. In 1985, however, at least one person was
 detained several weeks for criticizing the Government.
 Dozens of newspapers and magazines representing a broad
 spectrum of opinion are freely published, and the Government
 has tolerated the activities of extralegal radio and television
 stations operated by widely diverse political groups. There
 are reports that the Government occasionally advised newspapers
 against running specific articles. Such instances appear rare,
 however.
 Intimidation of journalists by militias and terrorists
 constituted the most serious threat to press freedom. In 1985,
 several Western journalists were abducted, and some remain in
 captivity. As a result, most other foreign journalists left
 the country. The offices of the leading leftist daily,
 As-Safir, were ransacked in West Beirut. Israeli forces at
 times banned journalists from certain sections of southern
 Lebanon. Christian militias have prevented the regular
 distribution in East Beirut of several leftist dailies.
 Intra-Christian rivalry resulted in the seizure of the Phalange
 Party newspaper Al-Amal by the Lebanese Forces militia and the
 temporary detention of its editor. This rivalry also caused a
 brief disruption in the publication of Le Reveil, a Christian
 newspaper generally sympathetic to the President.
 The continued breakdown in security in 1985 greatly disrupted
 schools and universities to the detriment of academic freedom.
 Terrorists and militiamen, who continued to intimidate
 university faculty and administrators, represented a serious
 threat to Lebanon's long tradition of academic freedom. In
 1985, two U.S. nationals, the dean of agriculture of the
 American University of Beirut (AUB) and the director of the
 American University Hospital (AUH), were abducted. In late
 1984, an American librarian at AUB also disappeared. Several
 Lebanese employees of AUB and AUH were abducted over the past
 year as well.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Government places no restrictions on the right of free
 assembly, as long as it does not incite popular unrest. Many
 groups in Lebanon excercised their right to engage in peaceful
 public demonstrations during the past year.
 The major constraint on this freedom came from the militias and
 foreign forces. In areas under the exclusive control of one
 militia, demonstrations or open shows of support for rival
 militias or political groups are not permitted. In South
 Lebanon, the Israelis had at times allowed peaceful
 demonstrations against their presence. On other occasions,
 they dispersed such demonstrators.
 Political groups, such as those which opposed the Israeli
 occupation, are not permitted to operate freely in areas still
 under the control of the Israeli-backed militia. The Syrians
 do not, in general, accept groups hostile to them in the areas
 which they occupy.
 
 
 1303
 LEBANON
 Lebanon has traditionally enjoyed democratic labor and
 management institutions. Collective bargaining and the right
 to strike continue to exist, despite 10 years of war. However,
 with unemployment reaching 30 to 50 percent in certain sections
 of the country, traditional labor practices have become
 increasingly irrelevant. There are no current statistics on
 union membership. Employees remain highly organized in the
 banking industry, which is one of the few sectors of the
 Lebanese economy which continues to function at near former
 levels. Lebanon's major labor union negotiates annual wage
 increases with the Government to offset inflation.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 The Government affirms the right of freedom of worship, and
 Lebanese practice their various religions with a great degree
 of liberty.
 The 1943 National Pact essentially allocated political power on
 a confessional basis, according to the proportion of various
 religious groups in Lebanon as determined by the 1932 census.
 The unwritten National Pact stipulated that the President would
 be a Maronite Christian, the Prime Minister a Sunni Muslim, and
 the Speaker of Parliament a Shi'ite Muslim. Seats in the
 Parliament were divided on a six to five ratio of Christians to
 Muslims. Positions in the government bureaucracy were
 allocated on a similar basis. Some religious groups thus enjoy
 greater institutionalized political power than others, and it
 has been frequently charged that politically powerful groups
 influenced government policies to the economic benefit of their
 coreligionists. Efforts to alter or abolish the confessional
 system of allocating political power have been at the center of
 Lebanese politics for more than three decades. Those religious
 groups most favored by the 1943 formula have sought to preserve
 it, while others who feel disadvantaged by it have sought to
 revise it on the basis of new demographic realities or to
 abolish it entirely. This struggle has given a strongly
 religious coloration to Lebanese politics and to the continuing
 civil strife there.
 The intensification of religious hatreds has led away from
 confessional mixing and towards confessional segregation.
 Today Lebanese live more and more in neighborhoods and villages
 inhabited exclusively by one religious community. Many fear to
 travel to areas where other sects predominate.
 Few Muslims live, for example, in East Beirut or openly
 practice their religion in predominantly Christian areas. Many
 Christians fled mainly Muslim West Beirut during 1985,
 complaining of increasing efforts to enforce Islamic mores and
 of a severe deterioration in public security. In the spring of
 1985, several thousand Christians were forced by various Muslim
 militias to abandon their homes in the Iqlim Al-Kharrub, Sidon,
 and the villages east of Sidon. Many of these displaced
 persons have sought refuge in Jazzin, in other Christian towns
 in South Lebanon, or in the predominantly Christian areas east
 and north of Beirut. Lebanon's tiny Jewish minority has been
 intimidated by kidnappings during 1985, and very few Jews
 r-emain in their traditional neighborhood in West Beirut.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 The Government does not restrict foreign travel by Lebanese
 citizens. Emigration and dual citizenship are permitted.
 
 
 1304
 LEBANON
 There is no impediment to voluntary repatriation by Lebanese
 with valid identity papers.
 Lebanon historically has been a land of asylum. During this
 century, it has given refuge to thousands of Armenians and
 Palestinians, as well as to smaller numbers from other Middle
 Eastern ethnic and religious groups. Lebanon's political and
 economic troubles in recent years have greatly diminished its
 appeal to refugees. Relatively few sought asylum there in 1985.
 Lebanon's relationship with the Palestinian community has been
 difficult. Most Palestinians, like other foreigners, have not
 been able to obtain Lebanese citizenship. Their status as a
 "state within a state" under the 1969 Cairo accords and their
 involvement in internal fighting from 1975 until 1982 resulted
 in the bitter enmity of many other groups. In the wake of the
 1982 conflict, many Palestinians have encountered difficulty in
 renewing residence permits and travel documents, and delays
 still continue. In 1985, some Palestinian combatants returned
 to Lebanon, and there were serious battles between them and
 Shi'ite Lebanese fighters.
 Lebanese traditionally enjoyed freedom of internal travel, but
 this freedom has been greatly circumscribed by militia groups
 which have established checkpoints to keep those deemed
 undesirable out of areas under their control. The so-called
 Green Line bisecting East and West Beirut remained closed for
 lengthy periods, effectively dividing the city and paralyzing
 many aspects of daily life in Beirut. Crossing the Green Line
 even when it was officially open remained extremely risky.
 Israeli forces and the Israeli-sponsored Army of South Lebanon
 maintained tight restrictions on the movement of people and
 goods into and out of areas which they occupied. For
 approximately five months, the Syrian Army imposed a travel
 permit requirement on Lebanese crossing into and out of Syrian-
 controlled territory in North Lebanon. This requirement
 seriously hindered travel between Beirut and the north.
 Because of the closure of the Green Line, fighting and
 kidnappings along the road to Beirut International Airport, and
 chaotic security conditions of the airport itself, many
 Lebanese encountered serious difficulties in traveling abroad.
 Travelers unable or unwilling to risk using Beirut
 International Airport, which is located in West Beirut, had the
 option of traveling overland to Damascus or using the ferry to
 Cyprus.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Formally, Lebanon is a parliamentary democracy. According to
 its Constitution, direct elections must be held for its
 99-member Parliament every 4 years. Parliament, in turn,
 elects a president every 6 years, and the President appoints a
 cabinet which must obtain the confidence of Parliament.
 Political parties may be formed. Women enjoy the same civil
 rights as men.
 A decade of political turmoil, growing militias, and foreign
 occupation has robbed these democratic institutions of much of
 their substance. No parliamentary elections have been held
 since 1972. Although Parliament, the Presidency, and the
 Cabinet continue to exist, their effective authority does not
 
 
 1305
 LEBANON
 extend to most of the country, which is under foreign
 occupation or militia control.
 In the past decade, violence has dominated the political
 process, as militia groups and foreign forces have resorted to
 force to gain their way. Leaders of the major factions met in
 Lausanne, Switzerland in March 1984 and agreed on a program for
 national conciliation. These leaders later formed a National
 Unity Government, whose efforts to implement the national
 conciliation program have so far not succeeded. In March 1985,
 the Cabinet ceased to meet regularly. In effect, Lebanon
 existed without a functioning Cabinet for most of 1985.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government has a mixed record in dealings with
 international human rights groups, and indigenous groups have
 not pressed the Government strongly on human rights issues.
 Families of missing persons demonstrated along the Green Line
 on several occasions in 1985, but these protests appear to have
 been directed against the private militias more than the
 Government. The ICRC functions widely in Lebanon. In its 1985
 Report, Amnesty International expressed concern about arbitrary
 arrests and detentions, including incommunicado detention,
 abductions, torture, and extrajudicial killings in regions of
 Lebanon under the effective control of the Government, the
 Israel Defense Forces, the Syrian Army, and a number of
 Lebanese militias. Freedom House rates Lebanon as "partly
 free."
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 Lebanon's population of 2,619,000 is growing at the rate of 2.1
 percent annually. Lebanon attained a high degree of prosperity
 in the 1950's and 1960's by acting as an entrepot and service
 center for much of the Middle East. During this period, wealth
 tended to concentrate in Beirut and, according to some, was
 channeled into the hands of members of the more powerful
 religious communities.
 Continuing civil strife has destroyed the basis of Lebanon's
 prosperity. Beirut's port and airport were closed frequently;
 tourism virtually ended. Many multinational firms moved their
 regional offices from Beirut to other capitals. Remittances
 from Lebanese workers abroad declined sharply, as did
 industrial production. Many banks faced large outstanding
 loans which they could not collect. The economy of South
 Lebanon was seriously harmed during the Israeli occupation
 because of restrictions on the flow of people and goods to and
 from this area. Since the Government of Lebanon does not
 control its border with Syria, it loses substantial revenues
 due to widespread smuggling. Unemployment continued to rise in
 1985, although no accurate statistics exist. Underemployment
 also remained a serious problem, since many employers have
 reacted to the economic slump by putting their employees on
 short time.
 In 1985, the Government continued to face great difficulty in
 dealing with the war's economic and social consequences. The
 loss of control of much of the country to militias and foreign
 armies drastically reduced its ability to collect direct taxes,
 and the intermittent closure of Beirut's ports and smuggling
 
 
 1306
 LEBANON
 through private, militia-run ports greatly diminished the
 collection of customs fees which traditionally supplied the
 bulk of government revenues. In effect, government revenues
 have virtually ceased, and expenditures are reduced mainly to
 paying the salaries of civil servants through deficit
 financing. Although the Council of Reconstruction and
 Development has, for example, financed a few public road
 projects, the Government has little ability to respond to the
 needs of the population. Subsidies of wheat and petroleum
 products continue, but it is uncertain how long the Government
 can sustain them, particularly in view of the spread of
 malpractices in the trade of these commodities.
 The economic welfare of most Lebanese continued to decline in
 1985, with the country remaining divided and the Lebanese pound
 faltering. The most depressed areas are those parts of the
 cities, especially Beirut and its suburbs, which have suffered
 most from the impact of the war and from the influx of
 displaced persons. Hardships in these areas are mitigated
 somewhat by the distribution of funds and commodities by
 religious and other relief organizations. The rural population
 appears to maintain a reasonable income, as agricultural
 production continues at historically depressed but still
 significant levels.
 The infant mortality rate is 41.60 per 1,000 live births and
 life expectancy at birth is 65.93 years. The adult literacy
 rate is about 68 percent. During the era of prosperity before
 the war, Lebanon's medical and educational facilities had
 attained a level unmatched in the other Arab countries of the
 region. Both have since declined because of the war and
 domestic turmoil.
 Lebanon has comprehensive labor laws covering a range of issues
 involving workers' rights, including minimum wages, safe
 working conditions, length of the workweek, child labor, and
 annual holidays. However, given the civil strife engulfing the
 country, it is not known whether these statutes continue to be
 enforced.
 Women enjoy equality of civil rights and attend institutions of
 higher learning in large numbers. Religion, social tradition,
 and the prevailing atmosphere of insecurity and economic
 hardship make it difficult, however, for women to expand their
 participation in Lebanon's social, political, and economic
 institutions. The women's organizations that do exist are, for
 the most part, subordinate arms of political parties which work
 to advance the interest of the parent party rather than that of
 women in general.
