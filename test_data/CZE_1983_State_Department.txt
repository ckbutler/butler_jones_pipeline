 CZECHOSLOVAKIA
 The Czechoslovak Socialist Republic is a centralized Communist
 state in which all important political and social matters,
 including the scope of individual human rights, are completely
 controlled by the party leadership. The country has a relatively
 advanced, centrally planned economy, and a sophisticated,
 well-educated population which has had long contact with the main
 currents of Western European thought and tradition. The two main
 ethnic groups--the Czechs and the Slovaks--have had different
 historical experiences and developments, and accommodation of the
 interests and aspirations of both groups within one country has not
 always been a smooth process. Slovak resentment at the
 longstanding domination of the central Government by the more
 numerous Czechs led to the adoption in 1968 of the present federal
 system in which some domestic functions are almost entirely
 delegated to the separate Czech and Slovak governments, and Slovaks
 are more heavily represented than previously in federal
 institutions.
 In 1968, after a brief period in which the Communist Party itself
 attempted to incorporate national aspirations and a degree of
 liberalization and democracy into its program, the troops of the
 Soviet Union and four other Warsaw Pact states invaded
 Czechoslovakia and terminated this development. The subsequent
 purge of the Communist Party and the stationing in Czechoslovakia
 of about 80,000 Soviet troops have insured that little change
 detrimental to Soviet interests has occurred in the country's
 political and economic system since that time. The Government
 continues to rely on Soviet support to remain in power..
 The structure of the Government is paralleled by a large party
 organization, at the top of which is the Central Committee, the
 Secretariat, and the Presidium. While in theory the President and
 the federal ministries (and the Federal Assembly) govern the
 country, in fact they merely administer policy decided by the
 party's eleven-member Presidium and its subsidiary organs, which
 holds the real political power in the country.
 A well-funded and abundantly-staffed security apparatus exists in
 Czechoslovakia under the direction of the Ministry of the Interior
 and the party hierarchy. Both the uniformed police ("public
 security") and the secret police ("state security") operate under
 the auspices of the National Security Corps. Generally speaking,
 members of the "public security" force function much as a police
 force in the West. The "state security" forces, however, are those
 who conduct surveillance of politically suspect persons and carry
 out the frequent interrogations of persons suspected of being
 opponents of the regime. The regime depends on the security
 apparatus as a main prop to insure its continued existence and
 stability.
 Human rights conditions in Czechoslovakia did not alter
 significantly during 1983, and the regime's record remains
 fundamentally flawed with slight prospects for improvement. The
 present Government, a product of the aftermath of the 1968
 invasion, maintains a policy of harassing and punishing citizens
 or groups (such as Charter 77) which monitor observance by the
 authorities of such international human rights instruments as the
 Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the Helsinki Accords.
 The Czechoslovak economy is centrally planned with almost no scope
 for private enterprise or ownership in manufacturing, retail
 operations, agriculture, or services. When the Communist regime
 came to power in 1948, it inherited a relatively advanced
 
 (957)
 
 
 958
 industrial plant which, unlike that in most other countries in
 Europe, had not been destroyed by the war. In addition, the
 population was skilled and technologically advanced. However, the
 growing obsolescence of much of the economic plant and
 infrastructure, the lack of adequate incentives for the labor
 force, difficult international economic conditions, and sharply
 increased energy costs have led to a period of economic stagnation
 in Czechoslovakia. The regime, in an attempt to deal with this
 problem introduced a "set of measures" in 1981, which allowed for a
 slight increase in private production on a small scale, among other
 things, but which has proved insufficient to arrest the gradual
 decline in the standard of living of the ordinary Czechoslovak
 citizen.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1  Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Unlawful or Arbitrary Deprivation of Life
 There is no evidence that the Czechoslovak Government killed
 persons for political motives in 1983.
 b. Disappearance
 No instance of disappearance have been reported in Czechoslovakia
 in 1983.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 In spite of the constitutional provision which states that
 "inviolability of the person shall be guaranteed," there are
 numerous reports that the police sometimes use harsh measures, such
 as beatings during interrogations of detained persons. This is
 especially true in political cases, and beatings have been reported
 in police stations as well as on the street under circumstances
 which led the victims to believe that the actions were performed by
 police or security officials. There have been no reports that
 police who engage in such actions have been arrested or reprimanded.
 There are three categories of imprisonment in Czechoslovakia, with
 increasingly harsher regimes of incarceration for most serious
 crimes and recidivists. Visits to all prisoners by family members
 are limited, and the frequency with which visits are allowed varies
 according to the category of imprisonment. Political prisoners
 sometimes report that they are subjected to harsher treatment, not
 only by guards, but by fellow inmates. There are no reports of
 summary executions.
 Prison conditions in Czechoslovakia are poor, and can sometimes
 approach a level of inhuman and cruel treatment. This is
 particularly true with regard to political prisoners. The cells
 are small and unheated, and prisoners report that they receive
 administrative punishments, such as reductions in pay and
 limitations on free time, bathing, and exercise periods, for
 failing to meet unrealistically high work standards. The diet in
 prisons is reliably reported to be deficient. As a result, several
 persons have left jail, or been released early, in a seriously
 debilitated condition. The most widely publicized recent instance
 of this was that of Vaclav Havel who, after three and a half years
 in prison, contracted pneumonia and pleurisy and almost died prior
 to his early release in March 1983. His case is by no means
 
 
 959
 unique. Western diplomats state that their imprisoned nationals,
 serving various sentences usually for criminal acts, are
 occasionally forced by guards to do such things as kneel on a
 concrete floor for extended periods; any complaints of such
 treatment can earn them a beating or harsher treatment. At least
 one political prisoner who complained of such treatment found
 himself accused of "false testimony" and may have his sentence
 extended. In practice, effective redress for cruel and degrading
 treatment in prisons does not appear possible.
 In its July 1983 meeting, the World Psychiatric Association accused
 Czechoslovakia of misusing psychiatry for political purposes,
 causing Czechoslovakia to resign its membership in the organization.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Persons in Czechoslovakia are frequently detained or arrested for
 expression of views contrary to those of the regime. In general,
 these arrests are cloaked with legal process and carried out with
 warrants. Searches, when openly conducted, are also performed in
 many cases with warrants, but they are also carried out
 surreptitiously. Instances have also been reported in which
 persons driving a car have been stopped and had their vehicles and
 briefcases searched, despite protests that the officer involved
 (generally a traffic policeman) had not produced the necessary
 warrant. Such searches are generally directed against persons whom
 the regime has decided to harass, rather than actually detain.
 Under Czechoslovak law, a person may be detained for up to 48 hours
 without charge, although in practice this limit is often exceeded.
 It is normal for political activists to be repeatedly picked up and
 held for 48 hours and then released without charges. Once the
 regime has decided to press charges, the detainee may be held for
 60 days in investigative detention according to Czechoslovak law.
 Again this period can be, and often is, extended at the request of
 the prosecutor. In 1983, Ladislav Lis (a former Charter 77
 spokesman) was held in investigative detention for about six months
 before a trial date was set. His was not an isolated case.
 Generally, persons arrested for expression of views opposed by the
 regime are charged with one or more offenses including
 "subversion," "incitement," "defamation of the Republic," or
 "damaging the interests of the Republic abroad." Persons arrested
 on religious grounds are generally charged with "obstructing state
 control of religion" or "abuse of religious office." These
 articles of the criminal code are so elastic that almost any
 activity can be included under them.
 Because it fluctuates, the number of persons held in detention is
 difficult to estimate but probably does not exceed one hundred.
 For example, in March 1983 approximately 20 members of the
 Franciscan Order were detained during a series of police raids.
 All, however, were subsequently released after spending various
 periods of time in detention.
 Involuntary exile has also been used by the Czechoslovak Government
 to rid itself of critics. In some cases, this penalty has been
 inflicted on persons working or visiting abroad with official
 permission; the individual is simply stripped of his citizenship
 while abroad and refused the right to return. Several persons,
 particularly some active in artistic and intellectual fields, are
 reluctant to accept invitations from Western institutions since
 they fear they will not be allowed to return to Czechoslovakia. A
 more common form of exile, however, is directed against persons who
 
 
 960
 have already served a jail sentence. Upon release, they are asked
 to apply for permission to emigrate. If they refuse, the
 authorities often tell them they will be unable to secure
 employment, and progressive harassment of them is officially
 initiated. Frequently, after a year or so of this treatment, the
 person does apply to emigrate. In at least one case, a prominent
 dissident has been offered release from prison on the condition
 that he declare his guilt and agree to emigrate. So far he has
 refused to do so.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 In theory, persons charged with criminal offenses in Czechoslovakia
 are entitled to a fair and open public trial. Czechoslovak law
 provides that the accused has a right to be informed of the charges
 against him, to have counsel, and to present a defense. In
 practice, however, there are basic restrictions on these legal
 guarantees for persons charged with political offenses. Public
 access to trials of such persons is severely limited. In one
 recent case in which the defendant had no immediate family, no one
 was admitted to the courtroom, including three friends who had
 requested permission. Most often, only members of the defendant's
 nuclear family may attend trials, although others sympathetic to
 the state's case are generally permitted to attend. Efforts by
 Western diplomatic and media, and non-official Czechoslovak
 representatives to attend such trials have been uniformly
 unsuccessful. Although counsel may visit the accused both before
 and after his trial, a police officer is often present to monitor
 the meetings. Lawyers have been known to have been disbarred after
 too vigorous a defense of political opponents of the regime. In
 one reported case, the defense attorney refused to discuss the
 trial's outcome and length of sentence after the trial was over,
 making it impossible for friends of the accused to learn his fate.
 Defendants do exercise their right to defend themselves in court
 and occasionally have the charges dismissed or downgraded at the
 original trial or on appeal. In addition, in several cases in 1982
 and 1983, suspended sentences have been given to first-time or
 youthful offenders.
 The courts have only limited independence. Judges can be removed
 by either the Federal Assembly or by the national councils of the
 Czech or Slovak Republics. Civilians are tried by military courts
 only in special circumstances, such as espionage, for example. All
 verdicts and sentences can be appealed to at least one higher court
 by either the defendant or the prosecutor or both, but such an
 appeal can result in an increase in the sentence or addition of
 charges as well as reduction.
 The number of political prisoners serving sentences probably
 numbers between 30 and 50 in the Czechoslovak Republic. Few, if
 any, of these persons were involved in acts of violence. Almost
 all have been imprisoned for expressing their political or
 religious views and for disseminating information opposed to the
 official positions. The regime, however, does not recognize
 prisoners of conscience as such and accurate statistics are
 impossible to obtain.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home or
 Correspondence
 The Czechoslovak Government does not accept the concept of a sphere
 of private life independent of government interference. The homes
 of dissidents are often closely watched by the police, particularly
 in times of international meetings like "The World Assembly for
 Peace and Life, Against Nuclear War" in June 1983, in order to
 prevent or monitor their contacts with Western diplomats and
 newsmen. It is believed that monitoring of telephones, mail, and
 residences is widespread, again particularly in the cases of
 
 
 961
 politically suspect persons. The security apparatus depends also
 upon the work of informers. Generally speaking, the persons
 against whom these forms of surveillance are used are well aware of
 them and tailor their behavior accordingly. Despite constitutional
 guarantees of the inviolability of the home, house searches take
 place without warrants and the resulting evidence can be introduced
 in court. Broadcasts of Radio Free Europe in Czech and Slovak are
 jammed in Prague and other major cities, but can often be heard in
 rural areas. Voice of America, British Broadcasting Corporation
 and other Western broadcasts generally are received without
 difficulty. Many persons are able to receive West German or
 Austrian television.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Although the Czechoslovak Constitution guarantees freedom of speech
 and press, in practice these freedoms do not exist. The
 Constitution states that freedom be exercised "in accordance with
 the interests of the working class". In practice, this means that
 individuals may not voice opinions that differ from party policy,
 that question the legitimacy of party rule, the fundamental
 principles of the "socialist" state, or the regime's relationship
 with the Soviet Union. Likewise, academic freedom is severely
 curtailed by political directives; admission to the university and
 other institutions of higher education is generally restricted to
 young people who seem politically reliable.
 The printed expression of opinion is controlled, in the first
 instance, by generally requiring membership in one of the
 state-controlled organizations (Union of Writers, for example) in
 order to publish. All publishing houses are state-owned
 enterprises. In addition, all newspapers and magazines are
 published by political parties or mass organizations(e.g. the youth
 league, trade unions, or sports federation) which are all
 subordinated to party control and direction, or by officially
 recognized and controlled religious organizations.
 Publishing houses and all press organs also exercise an effective
 system of self-censorship, based on party guidelines. In cases
 where sufficient care is not exercised, fines are imposed.
 Only a few Western non-communist periodicals are allowed into the
 country, and those are unobtainable by ordinary people.
 Subscriptions must, in addition, now be paid in hard currency which
 is normally unavailable to the ordinary citizen. Western books
 chosen for translation and publication are generally those which
 show a negative side of life in the West. Access to Western
 publications of a political character in central libraries has been
 restricted since the early 1970's to individuals who obtain special
 permission from their employer stating that they need to read the
 publication for official purposes. Periodicals such as Time,
 Newsweek, or L'Express are placed in locked cabinets under the
 control of special personnel. Similar treatment is meted out to
 any books from the West which are regarded as "anti-communist" or
 materials from Czechoslovakia published during the liberalization
 period of 1968-69. Printing and reproduction devices, other than
 typewriters, are controlled by the Ministry of the Interior and it
 is illegal for an individual to possess one. Reproduction of
 printed materials is limited to eleven typewriter copies. The
 "publication" of samizdat material is normally accomplished by a
 chain of typists, each one of whom produces the legally allowable
 eleven copies. Since 1973 over 200 titles have appeared in the
 underground literary series Petlice (Padlock), also reproduced in
 this fashion.
 
 
 962
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Freedom of assembly is protected, in theory, by the Constitution;
 in practice, freedom of assembly and association are tightly
 controlled by the authorities. No public meetings can be held
 without permission from the police, and this permission is withheld
 except in cases where the meeting supports state objectives. When
 the authorities wish to have a large rally (e.g., May Day or "peace
 demonstrations"), persons are often pressured by local organizers
 to attend. All professional groups and all labor union
 organizations are completely controlled by the state and
 subordinate to its directives, and no independent organizations
 are allowed to exist. Periodically, as well, the authorities
 withdraw licensing permission from popular music groups when it is
 believed that their lyrics or music have become too avant-garde or
 the audiences for which they are performing are liable to express
 views contrary to the Government.
 Worker membership in the Communist Party-organized trade movement
 is virtually obligatory. Strikes, collective bargaining, and
 lobbying are not permitted. Workers have little influence over
 production or economic planning, but have had occasional success in
 bringing about improvements in working conditions. The right and
 duty to work are guaranteed in the Constitution. In practice,
 persons who hold political views opposing the Government have found
 it difficult to retain the positions for which they were trained
 and have been forced into menial jobs such as stokers, night
 watchmen, and street cleaners, a practice which has been criticized
 by the International Labor Organization during 1983.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 It is officially espoused government policy that "scientific
 atheism" is the only valid system of belief, although
 freedom of religious belief and freedom to practice religion are
 guaranteed in the Constitution. In practice, the state rigorously
 controls religious activity through the registration of the 18
 officially recognized religious groups, the licensing and payment
 of members of the clergy to perform their duties in the particular
 parish of their assignment, and by a number of other measures.
 Permission for an aspiring clergyman to attend a seminary must be
 granted by the state, and all parents must seek the permission of
 the local authorities for their children to receive religious
 instruction. In 1983, there have been a number of prosecutions of
 persons seeking to instruct would-be priests or children privately
 without state authorization. Religious publishing is permitted
 under the strict control of the state, which monitors official
 church newspapers. An edition of the Bible in modern Czech was
 published several years ago, but has long been sold out. In recent
 years, several members of Western religious organizations have been
 arrested for attempting to smuggle Bibles into the country.
 Religious samizdat publications are circulated within the country,
 and those responsible are occasionally prosecuted.
 Proselytizing is strictly limited, and several religious groups
 whose activities focus on missionary work (Mormons, Jehovah's
 Witnesses, and the like) are outlawed. Generally speaking, foreign
 clergy are not permitted to operate in Czechoslovakia. Male
 religious orders are not permitted, and this year about twenty
 members of the Franciscan Order were jailed, some for nearly three
 months. Two of the group were tried and found guilty but, shortly
 after, all of the group (including these two) were released.
 Female religious orders are not permitted to accept new members and
 are limited in their activities to nursing and the care of the
 
 
 963
 elderly in outlying areas. Overt religious activity may be
 slightly freer in Slovakia, a more openly Roman Catholic area than
 the Czech lands of Bohemia and Moravia.
 Nominally, about 11 million Czechoslovaks are Catholics and just
 over one million are Protestants. Some priests and much of the
 senior Catholic clergy have been co-opted into a pro-government
 organization of Catholics, Pacem in Terris, as well as the
 Czechoslovak branch of the Christian Peace Conference. That
 Conference includes all officially-recognized Protestant churches
 (except for the Seventh Day Adventists), and publicly supports the
 officially endorsed "peace policies" of the Czechoslovak
 Government. Both held well-publicized meetings prior to the World
 Assembly for Peace in June, for example.
 The Jewish community, numbering several thousand, has a central
 religious organization financially supported and controlled by the
 Government. There are synagogues and prayer houses open for
 worship. In addition, in Prague, there is a Jewish museum operated
 by the state. There are no Jewish schools or rabbinical
 seminaries, but one Czech Jew is attending a rabbinical seminary
 abroad and should finish his training by June 1984.
 Generally speaking, Czechoslovak clergymen are allowed foreign
 travel to attend conferences of their particular religious groups
 or to attend such meetings as the recent World Council of Churches
 convention in Vancouver. Cardinal Tomasek, the leader of
 Czechoslovakia's Roman Catholics, was allowed this year, as in the
 past, to travel to Rome in order to attend synodal meetings of the
 Church, but permission for him to travel either to Poland or
 Austria during the Papal visit to those two countries was withheld.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel,
 Emigration, and Repatriation
 Freedom of movement within Czechoslovakia is not restricted,
 although travel in some areas near the border or in the vicinity of
 military installations is proscribed. Travel by Czechoslovaks to
 other East European Communist countries has also become more
 difficult. Travel to Poland was severely curtailed immediately
 after martial law was declared, but this policy has been slightly
 relaxed recently to allow those who have personal invitations from
 family members to travel there. These restrictions probably were
 introduced in part to try to control so far as possible any spread
 of the unrest in Poland to Czechoslovakia. By limiting the
 amount of currency which can be changed and also by limiting the
 number of trips which may be made in a year, the Government has
 succeeded in greatly reducing the number of cross-border shopping
 trips to Hungary. A special passport has been introduced, valid
 only for trips to Yugoslavia, but this has so far been largely
 ineffective in limiting the number of Czechoslovak citizens who
 defect to the West via Yugoslavia. Travel to Western countries is
 difficult since travelers must obtain permission and, unless
 visiting close relatives, a hard currency authorization. Travelers
 to the West usually must leave some member of the immediate family
 at home to ensure their return. These restrictions are relaxed for
 retirees.
 Obtaining permission to emigrate is a long and arduous process,
 especially for persons in political opposition to the Government.
 Applicants must endure long waits and may occasionally suffer
 reprisals such as demotion or loss of job after applying. There
 are no special barriers to anyone emigrating to join a foreign
 spouse. Czechoslovakia occasionally denies the right of
 
 
 964
 repatriation by stripping the citizenship of those citizens it does
 not wish to return. Emigration passports are not valid for return
 to Czechoslovakia without special endorsement and voluntary exile
 is frequently a condition for permission to emigrate, particularly
 in cases where the emigrant does not have close relatives abroad.
 The only significant refugee group within the country is composed
 of Communists who have fled from non-Communist countries. The
 largest group in this category are the Greeks, but others,
 including Spaniards and Indonesians, are known to reside in
 Czechoslovakia. There are no known instances of forced
 repatriations from this group. There is a moderate outflow of
 refugees from Czechoslovakia, primarily persons who leave the
 country legally on vacation to non-Warsaw Pact European countries
 and do not return. This may amount to about 10 thousand people
 annually, but precise statistics are unavailable.
 Section 3   Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to
 Change Their Government
 All significant decisions regarding the Government, the economy,
 and society are made exclusively by the leadership of the Communist
 Party. Meaningful influence in politics is enjoyed only by members
 of the party and, within the party, only by a very limited number
 of leaders. Ordinary citizens, especially those who are not party
 members, have no role in the process of selecting their leaders or
 in making important political or economic decisions. Four minor
 political parties are permitted to organize and to publish their
 own newspapers but must conform their activities to the policy laid
 down by the ruling Communist party. All parties, together with the
 state-controlled organizations such as the Union of Socialist
 Youth, the Labor Movement, and The Union of Women, are represented
 in the National Front, the organization which selects a single
 slate of candidates for elective offices. In fact, however,
 political power in the country rests within the leadership of the
 Communist Party alone. There is little evidence of meaningful
 public discussion of social, political, or economic issues. The
 Government has reacted to attempts to broaden the political process
 by arrest and imprisonment.
 Women are equal under the law, and there are small, token numbers
 of women in the professions and in higher-ranking party,
 government, and management positions. However, there is only one
 woman member of the party Secretariat who holds her position
 ex-officio as the head of the Union of Women. There are no female
 Czechoslovak ambassadors or heads of departments in the Ministry of
 Foreign Affairs, nor are there any federal women ministers.
 About 600,000 ethnic Hungarians live in Czechoslovakia, primarily
 in Slovakia along the border with Hungary.   Primary education in
 Hungarian is provided in these areas as well as Hungarian language
 radio and television programs, newspapers, and magazines.
 Hungarians are proportionately represented in federal and local
 legislative bodies, but are under-represented in prestigious jobs
 in the economy and the state apparatus. Unhappiness at this
 subordinate role may be increasing. At least one Hungarian
 
 
 965
 dissident was brought to trial in 1983 for disseminating documents
 discussing the role of ethnic Hungarians; in the end, the judicial
 process was suspended but the charges against the individual have
 not been dropped. The only other sizable minority group in
 Czechoslovakia is the Gypsies, numbering about 250,000 persons, who
 are generally viewed by Czechs and Slovaks as occupying a lower
 social stratum. There are, however, an increasing number of
 Vietnamese laborers temporarily resident in Czechoslovakia. A
 February 1983 Czechoslovak press agency release put the number at
 30,000.
 Section 4   Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Czechoslovak Government reacts strongly to expressions of
 concern about human rights violations in Czechoslovakia by other
 governments or non-governmental institutions. In the past it has
 delayed or refused visas to members of international human rights
 organizations such as the Helsinki Watch Committee and Amnesty
 International. In early 1983, two members of the Helsinki Watch
 Committee obtained visas and traveled to Czechoslovakia, but were
 stopped by the police not long after their arrival and asked to
 depart the country. This incident reveals the continued
 sensitivity of the regime to any outside investigation of its
 performance on human rights which it consistently regards as
 interference in internal affairs.
 Two groups within Czechoslovakia concern themselves with human
 rights. One is Charter 77, a group of persons who signed a
 document first issued in January 1977 which calls on the Government
 to honor its commitment to international agreements on human
 rights, including the CSCE Final Act, as well as stipulations to
 that effect in the Czechoslovak Constitution. During 1983, Charter
 77  issued several studies on topics such as the domestic economic
 situation, the plight of individual political prisoners (e.g.,
 Havel and Lis), and religious discrimination. By far their most
 visible activity, in 1983, however, was the dissemination of
 documents which linked the achievement of "peace" to the observance
 of human rights within a nation. These statements were accompanied
 in May and June with a request to the authorities for permission
 for Charter leaders to participate in "The World Assembly for Peace
 and Life, Against Nuclear War", held in Prague at the end of June.
 Denied participation, they met unofficially with members of Western
 peace groups and engaged, insofar as was allowed by the security
 police, in a dialogue on peace issues. The second group, The
 Committee for the Defense of the Unjustly Persecuted, concentrates
 on abuses of the judicial system, and uses public records and
 reports from friends and relatives of the accused to issue
 communiques on cases where it believes the police, the courts, or
 the prisons have abused citizens' civil human rights. These
 communiques are distributed to Czechoslovak authorities.
 As a result of their activities, members of both these groups have
 suffered considerable persecution, including the loss of jobs,
 detentions, loss of educational opportunities for their children,
 imprisonment, and other forms of harassment. Such treatment
 appears to be applied in fluctuating waves and an almost random
 manner which merely accentuates the uncertainty with which an
 individual who becomes active in these monitoring groups must
 expect to live. Because of this treatment, many human rights
 activists have left Czechoslovakia, although new Charter
 signatories continue to step forward as well. Thus, while Charter
 77 and the Committee for the Defense of the Unjustly Persecuted
 
 
 966
 continue to provide a moral witness to the human rights violations
 of the regime, their effectiveness is strictly limited by
 harassment, imprisonment, and emigration, and they cannot be said
 to enjoy widespread support among a fearful population. In its
 1983 Report, Amnesty International cited its concern for the
 continued detention in Czechoslovakia of prisoners of conscience,
 for poor prison conditions, for persecution of "active Christians,"
 for the harassment of former political prisoners by the
 authorities, for the use of the death penalty, and for blatant
 disregard by Czechoslovak authorities "for their human rights
 obligations." Freedom House rates Czechoslovakia "not free."
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 In Czechoslovakia the basic needs of food and health care are met
 and the stable, largely urbanized population enjoys a reasonably
 adequate material existence. Health care is universally available
 via a national system administered and financed by the Government,
 although there are reports that prompt treatment is sometimes
 secured only through payments of bribes. Average life expectancy
 at birth is 71.2 years and the infant mortality rate is 15.9 per
 1,000 live births. There are occasional deficiencies of supplies
 and services, but these are attributable more to economic
 constraints or management deficiencies than to deliberate neglect
 of human needs. The average diet is more than adequate, with 139
 percent of needed calorie supply available for consumption as a
 percentage of the normal nutritional requirement. Annual
 consumption of meat was about 80 kilos per capita in 1982.
 Education is compulsory to 15 years of age. Literacy is nearly
 universal. The adjusted primary school enrollment ratio (1979
 figures) is 92 percent for the total population. Secondary and
 university education are free of charge, but there are many reports
 that the selection of students for courses and schools, in
 particular those leading to more desirable careers, is based on
 their parents' political standing and reliability. The Charter 77
 has also documented instances of this in a June 1, 1982, document
 on the education of children. Access to higher education thus
 appears to be an instrument of control over a large segment of the
 population. Opportunities also exist for evening study at the
 advanced secondary and technical level.
 Czechoslovakia has had a rising standard of living since the end of
 World War II, but recent figures show a tapering off. Annual gross
 national product per capita is $5,290. A pension system provides a
 minimum income; in addition some retirees are allowed to supplement
 their pension payments by working. Nonetheless, access to goods
 and services varies significantly with elites among Communist Party
 members, artists, and professional athletes enjoying privileges far
 above the norm.
 About 90 percent of Czechoslovak women of working age are
 employed. Most of them have lower paying, less skilled jobs,
 although they tend to receive pay equal to that of their male
 colleagues in those jobs. There are inconsistencies in the
 responsibilities women are asked to assume; they are encouraged to
 join the work force, but they are also offered incentives to have
