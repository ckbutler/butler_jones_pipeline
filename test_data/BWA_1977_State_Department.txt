 BOTSWANA
 The government of Botswana has demonstrated
 a genuine concern for human rights and for political
 and civil liberties. The constitution which it
 inherited on its independence from Great Britain in
 1966 provides specific guarantees for life, liberty
 and the security of the person. These have been
 respected in practice, and the government has
 committed itself to maintaining them in the face of
 rising regional turbulence and tension. Botswana
 maintains a democratic system of government,
 including free elections and a multi-party parliament,
 and tolerates public criticism of its policies.
 President Khama's personal dedication to human
 rights has been responsible for much of Botswana's
 good record, but a strong effort has been made to
 institutionalize these attitudes throughout the
 government and society.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 There have been no allegations of torture in Botswana.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 There are effective legal safeguards in Botswana
 against cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or
 punishment of any kind.
 c. Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 There are effective legal safeguards in Botswana
 against arbitrary arrest, detention or imprisonment.
 There are no political prisoners.
 d. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Persons charged with a criminal offense are presumed
 innocent until proven guilty in a fair and public
 trial with legal counsel.
 
 
 e. Invasion of the Home
 There are effective legal safeguards against arbitrary
 invasion of the home.
 2. Governmental Policies Relating to the Fulfillment
 of Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care
 and Education
 The government has given considerable attention to
 fulfilling the basic food and shelter needs of its
 poor. In 1977 it revalued its currency, despite the
 adverse effect on exports, specifically in order to
 place increased food purchasing power in the hands of
 the poor, who in Botswana constitute the overwhelming
 majority of the population and are heavily dependent
 on food imported from South Africa. Botswana policies
 designed to fulfill basic needs of the population
 include emphasis on agricultural development to meet
 the needs of the rural poor and on expanding education-
 al programs, including vocational training.
 Corruption is not a problem in Botswana. The small
 scale of society and the free (albeit government-owned
 and rather inexperienced) press militate against both
 petty corruption and the diversion of significant
 resources into the hands of a small elite.
 3. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties,
 Including:
 a. Freedom of Thought, Speech, Press, Religion
 and Assembly
 Botswana guarantees in principle and permits in
 practice freedom of thought, speech, press, religion
 and assembly. This freedom extends to critics and
 political opponents of the government. The country's
 only daily newspaper is government-owned but indepen-
 dently edited and free of censorship. Private-
 ownership of media is not prohibited, but has not
 so far proved economically feasible.

 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country,
 Foreign Travel and Emigration
 Freedom of travel within the country and abroad and
 the freedom to emigrate are also respected. Botswana
 imposes no special restrictions on foreigners
 wishing to enter but may be forced to do so in the
 future if her borders continue to be violated by
 foreign guerrillas and Rhodesian security forces.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political
 Process
 Botswana is a multi-party parliamentary democracy
 which allows open campaign criticism of the govern-
 ment and free, secret-ballot elections based on
 universal adult suffrage. Botswana's small white
 minority participates freely in the political
 process and is represented in Parliament and the
 Cabinet. Registration, voting and public discussion
 of policy problems have been encouraged by the
 President.
 4. Government Attitude and Record Regarding
 International and Non-Governmental Investigation
 of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Botswana welcomes outside attention to and investiga-
 tion of its human rights situation. Amnesty
 International believes the most serious human
 rights problem in Botswana involves not government
 actions but the status of the several thousand
 political refugees from neighboring states. It
 urges the government to continue giving them
 economic assistance and political shelter against
 any forced repatriation. Botswana has extended
 political asylum to refugees irrespective of their
 political orientation or race, but its ability to
 assist them economically is limited. In 1977 the
 U.S. donated $6 million to help ease the financial
 burden placed on Botswana by the refugees.
