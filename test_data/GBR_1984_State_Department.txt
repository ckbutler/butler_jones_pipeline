 UNITED KINGDOM
 The United Kingdom (U.K.) is a constitutional monarchy, whose
 government takes the form of a multiparty, parliamentary
 democracy. Human rights are traditionally respected and
 zealously guarded, both by the British people and their
 elected governments. As there is no written constitution,
 human rights are *residual'; that is, rights are assumed
 unless limited by statute.
 In Great Britain, human rights practices are exemplary, with
 few, if any, demonstrated or alleged abuses by the Government
 or opposition. In Northern Ireland, however, human rights
 traditions have been put to the test as the British Government
 combats terrorism and violence against British officials and
 Protestant loyalists by militant organizations demanding the
 forcible unification of Ireland, as well as reciprocal
 violence by both militant nationalists and loyalist groups
 against Catholics.
 Public safety is maintained by a civilian police force except
 in Northern Ireland, where army units support the police in an
 effort to provide security to a sharply divided society beset
 by terrorist violence.
 The United Kingdom has a highly developed industrialized
 economy with a mix of private and state-owned industries.
 Individuals may freely own property and pursue private
 economic interests under the law. The population benefits
 from a comprehensive social welfare program. Public policy,
 supported by legislation and or tradition, opposes
 discrimination on the basis of race, religion, sex, or
 political opinion.
 During 1984 new laws were passed affecting human rights,
 including the Prevention of Terrorism Act of 1984, a new
 Police and Criminal Evidence Act, and the Data Protection Act
 (designed to protect individuals against misuse of personal
 data stored in computers). In August 1984, the Government was
 able to lift notices of derogation it had earlier filed with
 the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and
 Fundamental Freedoms regarding its practices in Northern
 Ireland.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section I Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 British Government sources report that during 1984, 49 persons
 were killed by terrorists in incidents related to Northern
 Ireland; nearly half of those killed belonged to the security
 forces. During the same period, security forces killed 11
 persons.
 In October terrorists planted a bomb in the hotel in Brighton
 where the Prime Minister and most of the Cabinet were staying
 while attending the annual Conservative Party conference.
 Four people were killed and many were injured. All political
 parties expressed their horror and outrage over this attack,
 for which the Provisional Irish Republican Army claimed
 responsibility.
 
 
 1136
 UNITED KINGDOM
 In March 1984, machine gun fire from the Libyan Embassy
 directed at a small group of peaceful anti-Qadhafi
 demonstrators across the street killed a policewoman.
 The British Government does not practice or condone killing
 for political motives. Under the law, police may use such
 force as is reasonable in the prevention of crime. In this
 regard, human rights activists have expressed concern over the
 use of plastic baton rounds (PBR's or plastic bullets) by
 security forces for the purpose of riot control, which have
 caused over a dozen deaths in recent years.
 One highly publicized death occurred in August 1984 at a
 political rally in Belfast when a man participating in the
 rally was struck in the chest by a plastic bullet fired at
 close range. The police are investigating the circumstances
 of this death, but to date no results of the investigation
 have been revealed. The European Parliament voted in 1982 to
 ban the use of plastic bullets in all member states and passed
 a resolution in 1984 by an overwhelming margin calling for
 their ban specifically in Northern Ireland. Although
 acknowledging the danger of PBR use, the British Government
 contends they are less dangerous than live rounds. The
 abovementioned death was the first fatality from PBR injuries
 in over 18 months. A case on the use of PBR's brought before
 the European Commission on Human Rights by the National
 Council for Civil Liberties, was described by the Commission
 in 1984 as 'manifestly ill-founded' and was dismissed. In
 late October 1984, the Commission ruled that use of plastic
 bullets is 'acceptable' and *less dangerous than alleged."
 Concern has been raised about statements considered to be
 unfairly partial to the police made by judges in the 1984
 acquittals of four Royal Ulster Constabulary officers charged
 with murder in the shooting deaths, in separate incidents in
 November and December 1982, of one unarmed member of the
 Provisional Irish Republican Army and one unarmed member of
 the Irish National Liberation Army.
 In December 1984, a British soldier was convicted of murder
 and sentenced to life imprisonment for the on-duty shooting
 death of a Catholic.
 b. Disappearance
 British Government authorities do not abduct, secretly arrest,
 or hold persons in clandestine confinement, nor do they
 sponsor or condone such activities.
 Northern Ireland Office sources report that during the first
 11 months of 1984, over 59 persons were abducted, kidnapped,
 or illegally detained by terrorists in incidents related to
 the issue of Northern Ireland.
 In the spring of 1984, a leading Nigerian dissident resident
 in Britain was kidnapped, drugged, and placed in a crate on an
 aircraft destined for Nigeria. British authorities freed the
 man in question, and subsequently expelled two Nigerian
 diplomats and asked the Nigerian Ambassador not to return to
 London when he went home on consultations.
 
 
 1137
 UNITED KINGDOM
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 British domestic law forbids mistreatment or torture of
 prisoners and provides penalties for such abuse. Confessions
 obtained by torture or any other inhuman or degrading
 treatment are not admissible as evidence in court. It is not
 official policy in Britain to practice deliberately cruel,
 inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment of prisoners.
 The Government acknowledges, however, that some old British
 prisons are unsatisfactory and overcrowded, and many prisoners
 live in cramped, unhygienic cells. The Government is building
 new prisons, modernizing old ones, and expanding parole
 opportunities. With the opening of several new prisons in
 1984, penal facilities became officially capable of holding
 approximately 38,800 persons but were still holding close to
 43,300.
 There have been complaints about 'strip searching" in Northern
 Ireland jails, especially of women prisoners and visitors by
 female security personnel. Strip searching is now conducted
 only randomly for prisoners making home visits or court
 appearances. In contrast, visitors to the prison, including
 government officials, are subject to a 'rub-down search,"
 which involves an officer passing his or her hands over the
 visitor's clothing to detect hidden weapons. Despite
 allegations to the contrary, visitors to the prisons, unlike
 the prisoners themselves, are not subject to strip searches.
 In questioning arrested persons, police are expected to comply
 with the Judges' Rules and Administrative Directions to the
 Police, except where superseded by the Northern Ireland
 (Emergency Provisions) Act of 1978 (see section l.d. below).
 These rules serve as guidelines only because the United
 Kingdom has no exclusionary rule. Improperly obtained
 evidence and statements made by an accused person before being
 warned of his rights may be used in court. However, judges
 can and do refuse in court to accept improperly obtained
 evidence.
 Persons wishing to make complaints about police conduct may
 obtain a leaflet at any police station explaining how to file
 a complaint. However, there is'no independent board to
 investigate complaints, a fact criticized by the police
 federation itself. According to the latest figures available,
 in 1983, 30,691 complaints were completed, 1,448 of which were
 substantiated. Of these, 227 resulted in disciplinary or
 criminal proceedings against police officers.
 Under the present system, police investigate complaints
 against the police. The Government has proposed a new police
 complaints authority, independent of the police, to supervise
 police investigations and oversee disciplinary processes in
 serious cases.
 Although complaints have been filed regarding Royal Ulster
 Constabulary mistreatment of suspects, the British Government
 states that this is not due to gross misbehavior on the part
 of the police. No evidence to support or contradict this
 position has become available.
 The Government has resisted demands by persons convicted of
 acts of violence in Northern Ireland that they be given the
 status of political prisoners, as well as demands of Loyalist
 
 
 1138
 UNITED KINGDOM
 prisoners for separation from Republican prisoners. These
 attempts included prison protests, sometimes fatal hunger
 strikes, and complaints to the European Commission on Human
 Rights, which were dismissed.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The Criminal Law Act of 1967 and the Criminal Law Act
 (Northern Ireland) of 1967, which applies similar provisions
 to Northern Ireland, empower a constable to arrest without
 warrant any person whom he, with reasonable cause, suspects
 has committed, is committing, or is about to commit what is,
 or what he reasonably suspects to be, an arrestable offense.
 Procedures for bail, judicial determination of the legality of
 detention, and suits for false imprisonment are routinely
 utilized in the United Kingdom.
 Except as noted below, anyone arrested without a warrant must
 be released on bail if he or she cannot be brought before a
 magistrate's court within 24 hours, unless the alleged offense
 is serious. If detained in custody the defendant must be
 brought before a magistrate's court as soon as practicable.
 In some cases, magistrates have repeatedly remanded persons
 into custody for periods totalling up to 18 months before
 trial. With the recent opening of several new courts,
 including a temporary building to relieve long waits in the
 Greater London area, remand prisoners are now being held for
 shorter periods before trial. Extra magistrates have been
 appointed to eight different courts which have been burdened
 by large numbers of cases arising from picketing in the
 miners' strike, but they are not necessarily hearing only
 strike-related cases.
 Subject to review by Parliament, British common law allows for
 the abrogation of individual liberties by the executive in an
 emergency situation, such as the one posed by the continuing
 violence in Northern Ireland. Acting on the premise that the
 fundamental 'right to life' was in serious jeopardy due to the
 violence in Northern Ireland, the British Government adopted
 two acts to deal with the threat: The Northern Ireland
 (Emergency Provisions) Act of 1973, now amended and
 consolidated as the Northern Ireland (Emergency Provisions)
 Act of 1978, which is applicable only to Northern Ireland; and
 the Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary Provisions) Act of
 1984, which is applicable to the entire United Kingdom.
 Although both these acts empower the restriction of personal
 liberties, they are subject to parliamentary review and to
 mandatory renewal at frequent intervals.
 A recent independent review of the 1976 legislation by Lord
 Jellicoe confirmed that it had effectively reduced terrorism
 and recommended that the powers contained in the act be
 extended to combat international terrorism and not just that
 associated with Northern Ireland. The Jellicoe Report also
 recommended improved safeguards to minimize the risk of abuse,
 including a maximum life of the legislation beyond which it
 would lapse unless reenacted by Parliament. Lord Jellicoe's
 recommendations were subsequently incorporated into the new
 Prevention of Terrorism Act, passed by Parliament in 1984.
 This Act also gives the police the additional power to arrest
 without warrant persons anywhere in the U.K. whom they
 reasonably suspect to be involved with terrorism. Such
 persons may be detained for up to 48 hours after their arrest,
 
 
 1139
 UNITED KINGDOM
 and this detention may be extended for a further 5 days.
 Furthermore, as noted in the Jellicoe Report, police officers
 have the power to detain not only persons suspected of
 involvement in terrorism, but also persons from whom they wish
 to obtain information. Such detentions may extend up to a
 period of 7 days.
 Under the 1978 Act the police in Northern Ireland are
 empowered to arrest without warrant any person suspected of
 being a terrorist, and to detain that person for up to 72
 hours on their own authority. The 1978 Act also gives the
 police the power to arrest without warrant a person suspected
 of having committed, or being about to commit a "scheduled"
 offense (i.e., one listed on a schedule attached to the law).
 For the purpose of doing so, the police may enter and search
 without a warrant any premises or other place where that
 person is, or where the police suspect him of being.
 Furthermore, under this Act, members of the armed forces on
 duty may arrest suspected terrorists without a warrant and
 hold them for up to 4 hours, after which they must be
 transferred to police custody or released. Allegations that
 these limits have been exceeded by the police or the armed
 forces have not been substantiated. In Northern Ireland, the
 police have accepted that persons arrested under the
 provisions of the Terrorism Act and the Emergency Provisions
 Act have the right of access to a solicitor after 48. hours of
 detention. Human rights activists report that the 48-hour
 rule is not always followed, however.
 In 1983, the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland
 authorized Sir George Baker to begin an independent review of
 the 1978 Act. Published in April 1984, Baker's report
 concluded that the provisions of the 1978 Act were still
 necessary. The Government is still considering the
 recommendations contained in his report.
 In August 1984, the Government lifted all notices of
 derogation on its practices in Northern Ireland with the
 European Convention on Human Rights and the International
 Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. These derogations
 were originally filed when internment without trial was
 initiated, a practice dropped 8 years ago. After a careful
 review, the Government believes all its laws and policies are
 within the guidelines of the European Convention and the
 International Covenant.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 In the United Kingdom, fair trial is guaranteed by law and
 observed in practice. All criminal proceedings are conducted
 in public, with the exception of cases involving public
 security; public decency, at the judge's discretion; and
 juvenile court cases, from which the public, but not the
 press, is excluded. In a trial of charges under the Official
 Secrets Act, the court can be closed at the judge's
 discretion; the sentence must always be passed in public.
 Cases related to Northern Ireland are often tried by a judge
 sitting alone, under legislation which decrees that terrorist
 offenses be tried in this manner. This form of criminal trial
 was introduced after the Diplock Committee, set up in 1972 to
 consider legal procedures to deal with terrorist activities in
 Northern Ireland, had recommended that, for scheduled
 
 
 1140
 UNITED KINGDOM
 offenses, trial by judge alone should take the place of trial
 by jury for the duration of the emergency. Among the
 arguments for this recommendation were that jurors were open
 to and afraid of intimidation or acts of physical violence
 against them, and that there was a continuing risk of unusual
 verdicts by partisan juries. However, juries continue to sit
 on all non-scheduled offenses and these constitute the
 majority of criminal cases. Unlike other courts in the U.K.,
 the Diplock courts may admit in evidence statements made in
 custody by the accused, provided that such statements were not
 made as a result of torture or inhuman or degrading treatment.
 The absence of a jury and the ability to convict solely on the
 basis of confession have been the subjects of criticism. Some
 human rights activists see an increasing tendency to rely on
 confessions rather than search for independent evidence of
 guilt or innocence. Critics also maintain that the conviction
 rates in the Diplock courts are unusually high. Judges in
 these courts must give written reasons for their decisions,
 which are made public. Defendants convicted in Diplock courts
 have an automatic right of appeal to the three-judge Court of
 Appeals (Criminal), on any ground, against conviction or a
 sentence. The independent review by Sir George Baker reported
 that the use of Diplock courts has been, and is, necessary.
 Increased use of evidence provided by terrorist informers
 (Isupergrasses") in non-jury courts has aroused discussion.
 Government officials state that the use of these informers has
 led to a marked reduction in the level of violence in Northern
 Ireland. Although the evidence of an accomplice has always
 been admissible in U.K. courts, in non-jury courts the judge
 alone, not the Government, must decide whether the evidence of
 the 'supergrass" is credible, bearing in mind the danger of
 convicting on the uncorroborated evidence of an accomplice.
 Critics assert that this places too great a burden of
 objectivity on a single individual. They also question
 whether the gains to security and public safety arising from
 the "supergrass" procedure outweigh the dangers to the
 credibility of the judicial system in Northern Ireland. In
 October 1984, a judge ordered the release of a person who had
 been held on remand for over 2 years on "supergrass'
 evidence. In Decmber 1984, 35 persons, accused under
 "supergrass" procedures of various crimes including murder,
 were acquitted. Some had been awaiting trial for almost 2
 years. The number of persons convicted during 1984 with
 "supergrass" evidence was 18 Republicans and 2 Loyalists.
 In December 1984, the Northern Ireland Standing Commission on
 Human Rights made recommendations to the Government for
 changes in the Northern Ireland (Emergency Provisions) Act of
 1978 which, if adopted, would reduce the number of cases tried
 in Diplock courts, introduce three-judge panels to replace the
 single judge now in charge, restrict the use of "supergrass"
 evidence, and make other changes.
 The Criminal Law Jurisdictions Act, enacted by both the
 British Government (1975) and Irish Government (1976), permits
 trial in the Republic of Ireland, in Northern Ireland, or in
 Britain of those accused of certain terrorist offenses,
 regardless of where the offense was committed.
 
 
 1141
 UNITED KINGDOM
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The right of privacy is well respected in the United Kingdom.
 In 1984 a number of significant developments occurred in this
 area.
 A Data Protection Act, designed to protect individuals against
 misuses of personal data stored in computers, and a new Police
 and Criminal Evidence Act were passed by Parliament in 1984.
 Human rights advocates successfully sought to ensure that the
 new laws would provide adequate protection from disclosure,
 search, and seizure of confidential records maintained by
 journalists, doctors, priests, social workers, and others.
 The Home Office undertook a review of its guidelines on the
 use of surveillance technology, as controversy arose over
 police use of hidden video cameras. The Royal Commission on
 Criminal Procedure recommended that a magistrate's warrant be
 required for such use, which presently can be authorized by
 police officials themselves.
 Police use of telephone tapping was also criticized in a case
 referred to the European Court of Human Rights in 1983.
 Administrative regulations currently allow wiretapping only
 under a warrant from the Home Secretary. The court ruled that
 the British Government was technically at fault, as wiretap
 regulations were administrative and not statutory. The
 Government plans legislation to meet the court's criticism.
 Warrants are generally required to search private premises.
 However, under the Northern Ireland (Emergency Provisions) Act
 of 1978, any member of the armed forces on duty or any
 constable may enter any premises or other place, if he or she
 considers it necessary to do so to preserve peace or maintain
 order. This provision was introduced in recognition of the
 practical difficulty of obtaining a warrant in certain
 situations involving terrorist incidents, but it has been
 criticized for allowing excessively broad powers of entry on
 mere suspicion of wrongdoing.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Personal liberty and freedom of speech are well established by
 British history, custom, and tradition.
 While the Government appoints the Board of Governors of the
 British Broadcasting Corporation, it does not seek to control
 the content of programs. Viewpoints independent and critical
 of the Government are well represented.
 There is no Government intimidation or censorship of the
 media, or of foreign and domestic books and artistic works.
 However, on matters of national security falling under the
 Official Secrets Act, the Government may prevent the
 publication of certain materials. Under this Act, the
 Government is prosecuting a former Under Secretary of Defense
 for leaking papers alleging government misconduct related to
 the sinking of an Argentine warship in 1982.
 Self-policing by the media is practiced by such independent
 bodies as the British Board of Film Censors, operating under
 clear, published, apolitical guidelines. Under certain very
 
 
 1142
 UNITED KINGDOM
 restricted circumstances a court injunction may be obtained to
 prevent publication of particular items shown to be defamatory.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Freedom of peaceful assembly and association are a part of the
 long established tradition of civil liberties in the U.K.
 Except in cases of extreme civil disorders in which public
 safety is judged to be at risk, the British authorities do not
 exercise their statutory right to limit individuals' freedom
 to attend public meetings of their choice. Neither is any
 limitation placed on individual freedom to join associations,
 including trade unions, with the exception of several militant
 organizations, such as the Irish National Liberation Army and
 the Provisional Irish Republican Army.
 British trade unions have full rights to organize, negotiate,
 and strike on behalf of their own members. The Employment Act
 of 1980, however, makes unions liable under civil law for
 losses resulting from 'sympathy" strikes. In the rare
 instance where the right to strike is prohibited, e.g., for
 police officers, there are other means to resolve labor
 differences.
 The Government does not control, intimidate, harasss, or
 persecute unions and other associations, nor does it limit in
 any way their freedom to maintain relations with recognized
 international bodies. However, in 1984 the Government
 prohibited continued trade union membership for public
 employees at its communications headquarters at Cheltenham on
 grounds of national security. The ban was first overturned
 and then upheld in the courts. The International Labor
 Organization's Committee on Freedom of Association reviewed
 this case and urged the Government to negotiate with the
 unions involved to reach an agreement that would meet both the
 Government's concerns regarding continuity of operations at
 Cheltenham and conform to the Convention on Freedom of
 Association and Protection of the Right to Organize.
 In connection with the lengthy 1984 coal miners' strike, some
 commentators have expressed concern about:  limitations on
 secondary picketing, which is illegal in the U.K.; inhibitions
 on the movement of striking miners into areas where miners are
 not on strike; and allegations of police brutality in
 confrontations with strikers. Others have called attention to
 instances of intimidation against working miners by those on
 strike.
 Another significant exception to freedom of association in the
 U.K. is a response to terrorist violence associated with
 Northern Ireland. The Prevention of Terrorism Act of 1984 and
 the Northern Ireland (Emergency Provisions) Act of 1978
 include sections prohibiting membership in or support of
 organizations (Loyalist and Republican) which are involved in
 terrorism. These organizations are specifically listed in the
 statutes. The lists do not include political parties, even
 those such as Provisional Sinn Fein with close links to
 militant organizations which carry out terrorist acts.
 Persons prosecuted under the 1978 Act are brought to trial in
 accordance with the trial procedures laid down by that Act.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 As a matter of Government policy and in general practice,
 
 
 1143
 UNITED KINGDOM
 everyone in Britain has religious freedom (in teaching,
 worship, and observance) without interference from the
 community or the state. Churches and religious societies may
 own property, conduct schools, and propagate their beliefs in
 speech and writing. Virtually every religion and sect found
 in the world is represented in the U.K. There is no religious
 or denominational bar to the holding of public office except
 in the case of the Sovereign, who must be a member of the
 Church of England. The Sovereign's children must be raised in
 this church or they lose their right of succession to the
 throne.
 England and Scotland both have established churches. The
 established church's relationship with the state is one of
 mutual obligation--privileges accorded to the church balanced
 by certain duties which it must fulfill. The state makes no
 direct financial contribution to church expenses. Church
 independence was demonstrated in 1984 when leading bishops
 criticized government policies. The existence of established
 churches does not limit the freedom or access to public life
 of members of other churches. The Church of Ireland and the
 Church of England in Wales have been disestablished.
 In Northern Ireland, the Constitution Act of 1973 specifically
 prohibits discrimination on the basis of religious belief or
 political opinion.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 In general, U.K. citizens have freedom of movement within the
 country, and in foreign travel, emigration, and repatriation.
 One exception to this general principle is contained in the
 Prevention of Terrorism Act of 1984. The Act gives the Home
 Secretary the authority to exclude or prevent from entering
 Great Britain (comprised of England, Scotland, and Wales)
 anyone he believes may be connected with terrorism related to
 Northern Ireland, unless that person was born in Great Britain
 and has been ordinarily resident there, or has been ordinarily
 resident there for 3 years. Only one person was excluded in
 1984. The Secretary of State for Northern Ireland also has
 the power to exclude people from that province on the same
 grounds, unless they were born and have been ordinarily
 resident in Northern Ireland, or have been ordinarily resident
 there for 3 years. In addition, any person may be excluded
 from the United Kingdom who may be ordinarily resident in the
 United Kingdom, but who is not a U.K. citizen, and is involved
 in terrorism related to Northern Ireland. Once excluded from
 a region of the United Kingdom, the person is forbidden to
 reenter that area. Under the 1984 Act, exclusion orders are
 subject to review after they have been in force for 3 years.
 These powers have been referred to by many, including the
 National Council for Civil Liberties, as a system of internal
 exile.
 With the entry into force in 1983 of the British Nationality
 Act of 1982, two new categories of citizenship--British
 dependent territories citizenship and British overseas
 citizenship--were created for those citizens of the United
 Kingdom and colonies who had no 'close connection with the
 United Kingdom.' People in these categories lost none of
 those rights they may have had to enter the United Kingdom
 before the new Nationality Act came into effect.

 1144
 UNITED KINGDOM
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 The United Kingdom is ruled by a Government formed on the
 basis of a majority of Parliamentary seats won in freely
 contested elections. Participation in the political process
 is open to all persons and parties, of which there are several
 representing a broad range of political views.
 For Parliamentary and local elections, the franchise is given
 to all citizens 18 years of age and over. The right to
 citizenship itself was significantly affected by the British
 Nationality Act, which came into force on January 1, 1983.
 Under one of its provisions, the automatic, unchallengeable
 right to British nationality, previously accorded to virtually
 every child born in Britain, now extends only to those
 children born on British soil, of whom one parent has the
 right of permanent residence in the U.K. This provision has
 been criticized by immigrants' welfare groups as likely to
 leave many children born in Britain (of refugees, stateless
 persons, and transients) effectively stateless and
 deportable. The Act also affects the status of citizens of
 British dependent territories and former colonies.
 Women have full rights of participation and are represented at
 all levels of British political life, but in relatively small
 numbers. Of 650 members of Parliament, 24, including the
 Prime Minister, are women. Women officers in both major
 political parties have complained of de facto discrimination
 against women within their respective parties. Although
 racial minorities comprise about 5 percent of the total
 population, no members of these groups presently sit in the
 House of Commons.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The United Kingdom participates in several international and
 regional human rights bodies, including the European
 Commission on Human Rights, the U.N. Human Rights Commission,
 and the U.N. Commission on the Status of Women. In addition
 Britain is a party to several human rights conventions. The
 British Government is an advocate of measures to improve the
 human rights machinery of the United Nations.
 The British Government generally maintains an open attitude
 toward international inquiries into alleged violations of
 human rights in the United Kingdom. It cooperates fully with
 the European Commission on Human Rights in investigations of
 complaints and takes steps to rectify its own laws and
 policies when they are found not to be in conformity with the
 European Convention.
 Britain is the host country to several international
 non-governmental human rights organizations, such as Amnesty
 International. Over 100 active national organizations in this
 field, representing a wide divergence of views, operate freely
 xn London and throughout the country.
 Amnesty International's 1984 report (covering 1983) expressed
 concern that the so-called Diplock courts in Northern Ireland
 may not conform to international standards for a fair trial.
 The report also stated that Amnesty is studying shootings in
 
 
 1145
 UNITED KINGDOM
 Northern Ireland to assess charges that the Government has a
 deliberate policy of having suspected terrorists killed. This
 has been strenuously denied by the Government. Amnesty also
 criticized a number of aspects of prosecution in "supergrass"
 cases. Amnesty adopted no prisoners of conscience in the
 United Kingdom. Freedom House rates the United Kingdom
 "free,* although it noted that 'in Northern Ireland a severe
 security situation has led to the curtailment of private
 rights, to imprisonment, and on occasion to torture and
 brutality.' After government investigation, Freedom House
 wrote, these conditions improved.
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 Through a highly developed welfare system, the British
 Government meets the health, educational, and other basic
 needs of the people. The National Health Service provides
 comprehensive medical services to the entire population of
 just over 56 million. Life expectancy at birth is 74 years,
 and infant mortality is 9.8 per 1,000 live births. The adult
 literacy rate is 99 percent. The 1982 per capita gross
 national product was about $9,662. By and large, services are
 fairly distributed, but a recent Home Office report states
 that some de facto discrimination continues in the provision
 of goods and services.
 The Race Relations Act of 1976 bars discrimination on the
 basis of race, color, nationality, or national or ethnic
 origin. The Commission for Racial Equality, established under
 the Act, has studied racial discrimination in housing
 allocation and made recommendations to public housing
 authorities. Other studies have documented a black
 unemployment rate that is nearly double that of whites, black
 overrepresentation in manual jobs, and racial discrimination
 in job recruitment. In 1984, a Code of Practice on
 Employment, proposed by the Commission and accepted by the
 Government, took effect. Although the Code does not have the
 force of law, it can be used as a standard of good practice by
 industrial tribunals in racial discrimination cases and can
 serve as a guideline for firms in eliminating direct and
 indirect forms of discrimination.
 Equal status and equal opportunity for women in professional
 fields is provided by law. Under the Equal Pay Act of 1970,
 women are entitled to equal pay with men for doing work that
 is the same or broadly similar. The Equal Opportunities
 Commission assists in the enforcement of these Acts. There is
 corresponding legislation and a separate commission for
 Northern Ireland.
 Despite their legal rights to equal employment, however, in
 practice women have yet to achieve fully equal status in the
 United Kingdom. The average female wage-earner takes home
 only three-quarters the pay of her male counterpart and women
 hold three-quarters of Britain's lowest-paying jobs. In 1982,
 the European Court of Justice found that Britain had failed to
 institute a fair system of ensuring equal pay for equal work
 and ordered the U.K. to establish a means of requiring
 employers to introduce job classification systems on the basis
 of which equal pay claims could be adjudicated. Trade unions
 have complained of discrimination against women in
 occupational pension schemes, unemployment benefits,
 inadequate care allowances, and housewives' non-contributory
 invalidity pensions.

 On the other hand, progress toward women's equality is also
 visible. In November 1983, a rule change in the Social
 Security benefit payments system allowed women to be treated
 as head of the household and to claim benefits in ways that
 only men could do previously. A proposed Social Security bill
 giving men and women equal state pension rights was introduced
 in Parliament. Over twice as many women as men have been
 recruited into the Civil Service over the past few years in an
 attempt to redress previous imbalances. In 1984, Parliament
 repealed legislation that prohibited married women in Scotland
 from selecting the location of the family home.
 In Northern Ireland, the majority Protestant community is more
 prosperous and highly skilled, and controls much of the local
 economy. The unemployment rate in Northern Ireland is
 substantially higher than that of the United Kingdom as a
 whole, and this burden falls disproportionately on the
 minority Catholic population. The reasons for this are
 complex, involving a long history of discrimination by the one
 community against the other for the purpose of maintaining its
 traditionally dominant position. British Government policy
 attempts to alleviate the problem by promoting equal
 opportunities, attracting more investment to the area, and
 subsidizing the economy through public sector spending.
 Since 1972, when direct British rule was introduced in
 Northern Ireland, specific measures have been taken to combat
 religious discrimination against Catholics. These include the
 institution of universal suffrage and abolition of voting
 limitations based on property; prohibition of religious or
 political discrimination by any level of government;
 establishment of a Commissioner for Complaints to deal with
 grievances against local government; establishment of a
 Central Housing Authority to meet the problem of
 discrimination in housing; prohibition of discrimination in
 employment; and a special effort to recruit more Catholics
 into the Civil Service and the Police. While not disputing
 the value of these structures, critics are not satisfied and
 point to slow progress in remedying historical imbalances.
