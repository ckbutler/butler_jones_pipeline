 GHANA
 Ghana is governed by the Provisional National Defense Council
 (PNDC) under the chairmanship of Flight Lieutenant Jerry John
 Rawlings, who seized power from an elected government on
 December 31, 1981, and abolished the Constitution, which has
 never been replaced. Under the Establishment Proclamation of
 January 11, 1982, the PNDC exercises "all powers of
 government." In practice, government policy is developed by
 Chairman Rawlings, assisted by a number of close advisers,
 both inside and outside the Government. In addition to
 Chairman Rawlings, the PNDC consists of eight members, of whom
 two are serving military officers and six are civilians. The
 executive consists of ministries headed by secretaries, most
 of whom are subordinate to a PNDC member responsible for that
 particular area of government. There is a quasi-political
 organization in the countrywide network of Committees for the
 Defense of the Revolution (CDR's), which are designed as a
 channel to transmit government policies to the citizens.
 There is no national legislature or lawmaking body. All
 national, regional, and many district officials are appointed
 by the PNDC. In December the Government held district-level
 elections for 56 newly created district assemblies; elections
 for the remaining 54 district assemblies were scheduled for
 early 1989.
 The several security organizations which exist in Ghana report
 to various departments of government, but all come under the
 control of the PNDC. Most security cases of a political
 nature are handled by the Bureau of National Investigation
 (BNI), which reports to the PNDC member responsible for
 security issues.
 Starting in 1983, the Government adopted an Economic Recovery
 Program (ERP) to redress a quarter century of economic
 mismanagement and political instability which caused Ghana to
 decline from one of Africa's most promising economies to near
 collapse. Conducted in concert with the International
 Monetary Fund, the World Bank, and a consultative group of
 bilateral donors, the recovery program has had a positive
 impact. The economy has grown annually since the inception of
 the ERP, and inflation, which rose in 1987 to 39 percent, was
 still far below the triple-digit figures of earlier years.
 There continue to be significant human rights problems in
 Ghana, with restrictions on basic rights such as freedom of
 speech, press, and assembly, and legal due process. The
 Rawlings regime has largely restored order following the
 18-month period of revolutionary excess in 1982 and 1983.
 However, there were two shooting incidents in May 1988
 involving members of the Civil Defense Organization (CDO), a
 militia based at the regional and local level. The national
 CDO head was replaced because of these incidents and new
 measures were taken to bring the CDO's under control.
 Similarly, in April there were major changes in the leadership
 of the national CDR to instill discipline and strengthen
 organization. There were no known coup plots in 1988.
 Arbitrary arrest and detention were continuing problems, with
 instances of incarceration without formal charges during
 investigations sometimes lasting more than a year.

 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There were no reports of politically motivated killings.
 b. Disappearance
 No politically motivated disappearances were reported in 1988.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 There have been occasional credible allegations of torture and
 beatings in recent years. Consideration was given to restoring
 corporal punishment in 1988 for convicted petty offenders,
 e.g., pickpockets, as punishment in lieu of a prison sentence;
 however, no law was enacted to this effect. Prisons in Ghana
 are antiquated, and conditions are harsh. In the last 18
 months, one American citizen died of a heart attack and another
 of malaria while being held in the Ghanaian prison system. A
 third American stated that while in prison in 1988 he had been
 physically mistreated and threatened with a pistol.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Ghanaian security forces occasionally take persons into
 custody, with or without a warrant, and hold them
 incommunicado for extended periods of time. The number of
 such cases is not known, but the threat of such treatment
 serves as a deterrent to activities deemed unacceptable to the
 State. PNDC Law 4 (Preventive Custody Law of 1982) provides
 for indefinite detention without trial if the PNDC determines
 it is in the interest of national security.
 In routine criminal cases, arrests generally conform to the
 legal procedures set forth in the criminal code. This code
 requires that an arrested person be brought before a court
 within 48 hours to be charged. However, the court can refuse
 to release a detainee on bail and instead "remand" him without
 charges for an indefinite period of time, subject to weekly
 review as a case is investigated. Habeas corpus is limited by
 a 1984 law which prevents any court from inquiring into the
 grounds for the detention of any Ghanaian under PNDC Law 2
 (which set up the National Investigation Committee and gave
 the Committee the power to investigate virtually any
 allegation referred to it by the PNDC).
 Four persons arrested in 1987 for their activities in leftist
 organizations--the New Democratic Movement (NDM) or the Kwame
 Nkrumah Revolutionary Guards (KNRG)--remained under detention
 without charge at year's end. They are K. Adu-Amankwah, head
 of the Trade Union Congress (TUC) political department, and A.
 Akoto-Ampaw, former Secretary General of the All-African
 Students Union, arrested May 18, 1987, for alleged seditious
 activities; and Kwame Karikari, University of Ghana lecturer,
 and K. "Orsino" Aryeetey, CDR activist, both arrested in mid-
 July 1987 under PNDC Law 4 (on preventive custody). Others
 similarly arrested without charges in 1987 but released
 between December 1987 and May 1988 were Ralph Kugbo, John
 Ndebugre, Kwesi Pratt, Geoffrey Kumfo, and Yao Graham.
 
 
 136
 GHANA
 In 1988 Amnesty International appealed for the release of the
 four men still in custody, plus some of those released earlier
 in the year. The PNDC has denied appeals from various
 organizations including the TUC, the National Union of Ghanaian
 Students (NUGS), and an informal group of university faculty
 members, citing national security considerations as
 justification.
 In recent years, a number of American citizens have been
 arrested and held without charge for lengthy periods without
 the U.S. Embassy being notified or provided access as
 stipulated in international conventions and a bilateral
 treaty. The Department of State issued a travel advisory in
 August 1988 warning American visitors of continuing problems
 with Ghanaian authorities, over notification and access and
 advising them of their rights under international law.
 The Government does not practice forced exile. In 1988 the
 Government continued quietly to encourage Ghanaian exiles with
 valuable skills to return home, offering them the opportunity
 to return with amnesty. A limited number of officials of the
 former government who fled Ghana in the early years of the
 revolution have returned and resumed careers outside of
 politics, apparently without difficulties. Others have
 remained abroad, particularly in the United Kingdom and other
 parts of Europe, in order to conduct active opposition to the
 PNDC or out of fear of political persecution.
 With regard to forced or compulsory labor, see Section 6.c.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 There are two court systems in Ghana. In the regular
 "prerevolutionary" court system, traditional legal safeguards
 are based on British legal practice. Trials are public, and
 defendants have a right to be present, to be represented by an
 attorney, and to present evidence and cross-examine witnesses.
 This system includes high courts, appeal courts, and a
 supreme court headed by a chief justice. Questions exist,
 however, about the independence of the regular courts. In
 April 1986, the PNDC summarily dismissed 16 judges, alleging
 that they were guilty of malfeasance. By this action, the
 PNDC put judges in the regular courts on notice that they
 serve at its sufferance. The independent Ghana Bar
 Association has urged the reestablishment of a judicial
 council to protect judges from arbitrary dismissal and
 preserve judicial independence.
 A separate public tribunals system was set up by the PNDC in
 1982 to bypass the regular court system and speed up the
 judicial process by deemphasizing legal "technicalities."
 This system includes the Office of Revenue Commissioners, the
 National Investigations Committee, the Special Military
 Tribunal, and the Public Tribunals Board, as well as the
 public tribunals themselves, which operate at the national and
 regional levels. Plans are under discussion to extend the
 public tribunal system to the district level as well. Most
 sensitive political cases and those involving security issues
 and capital punishment are heard by public tribunals. No
 appeals were permitted until 1985, when a National Appeals
 Tribunal was created.
 The public tribunals depend largely on judges with little or
 no legal experience, and they shortcut legal safeguards and
 due process to provide "rough and ready" justice. Presiding
 
 
 137
 GHANA
 judges are more often laymen than lawyers; there are no
 published guidelines concerning the admissibility of evidence;
 and conviction is by majority vote of the panel trying a
 case. Critics also contend that meaningful appeals are
 impossible because no adequate record is kept of initial
 hearings before tribunals. Judges on the appeals panel are
 drawn from the same pool of "lay judges" who hear initial
 cases. The members of the Ghana Bar Association, citing such
 shortcomings, have elected not to practice before the public
 tribunals. This means that in practice defendants may appear
 before the public tribunals with inadequate or no legal
 representation. In 1985 the Government approved the creation
 of a legal aid program, but it has been only marginally
 implemented.
 There are no reliable estimates of the number of political
 detainees and political prisoners in Ghana. There has been at
 least one published report, whose authority is uncertain, that
 there are 200 political prisoners in Ghana. The Government
 claims the actual number of political prisoners is small.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Citizens not engaged in activity objectionable to the
 Government are generally free from interference with regard to
 private conduct, although some critics characterize the local
 CDR's as "neighborhood watch committees." Monitoring of
 telephones and mail is presumed to occur, and forced entry
 into homes has been reported in connection with security
 investigations. The State supports family planning, but there
 is no interference with the right to marry or have children as
 one chooses.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Ghana has no constitution, and there are no guarantees of the
 freedoms of speech and the press. The PNDC Chairman has
 frequently encouraged people to speak out on local community
 concerns, though not on government policy. However, informers
 are said to exist, and some Ghanaians hesitate to speak frankly
 at public gatherings or attend certain functions.
 The Government owns the radio and television stations and the
 two principal daily newspapers. Reporting in government-owned
 media accentuates positive aspects of the revolution, but also
 covers selected instances of corruption and mismanagement in
 government agencies and state-owned enterprises. In general,
 media criticism of the revolution or of Chairman Rawlings and
 PNDC members, as well as of foreign and domestic policies, is
 not tolerated. Journalists are subject to discipline or
 dismissal by the Government for running articles deemed
 unacceptable, and the editor of the government-owned weekly
 The Mirror was dismissed in August.
 One or two of the few remaining privately owned newspapers
 have tried to be relatively bold-in reporting selected
 issues. The Kumasi-based Pioneer, for example, has at times
 taken provocative positions, including a series of editorials
 and articles criticizing Ghana's foreign policy and the
 Economic Recovery Program (ERP) and calling for the
 resignation of the Finance Secretary. However, several
 privately owned newspapers have closed down in recent years,
 
 
 138
 GHANA
 and in December 1985 the Government banned publication of the
 Catholic Standard; it remained banned in 1988. A few foreign
 periodicals such as West Africa, Time, and Newsweek are sold
 freely in Accra and other major cities, and even issues
 critical of Ghana are allowed to circulate. Western
 journalists are now routinely accorded visas and press
 credentials as opposed to the practice of a few years ago.
 Academic freedom tends to be respected within the confines of
 the campus. The National Union of Ghanaian Students, one of
 the more vocal critics of the PNDC, is tolerated and allowed
 to organize and hold meetings. Several leftwing political
 organizations, including the June Fourth Movement and the New
 Democratic Movement (NDM), were founded by faculty and
 students..at the University of Ghana. The NDM is viewed with
 particularly deep suspicion by the PNDC. Just prior to
 examinations in May, university students demonstrated over
 campus issues and forced the closing of all three universities.
 The Government's reaction was notably mild, with no police or
 military action and no public threats of expulsion or
 retaliation against the ringleaders. Universities remained
 closed in December, and no official announcement was made as
 to when they might reopen.
 Critics have charged, and the PNDC Chairman has publicly
 admitted, that fear of government reaction has led to the
 creation of a "culture of silence" in Ghana. When Professor
 Adu Boahen, speaking in February on the "culture of silence"
 at the annual Danquah Lecture Series, openly criticized
 government policies and officials, he was subjected to
 blistering attacks in the media (while his views went
 unreported) and was the reported target of military
 harassment. On a different plane, the Government closed all
 video houses in September 1988 because of the allegedly
 corrupting effects on the morals of youth of many of the
 videotapes shown, and it created a censorship board to pass
 judgment on the content of videotapes.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Assocation
 There are no constitutional guarantees of freedom of assembly
 and association, but individuals generally are free to join
 together formally or informally to promote benevolent or
 nonpolitical causes. Ghana has many private religious,
 social, and cultural organizations which are allowed to
 organize and gather with a minimum of legal or informal
 restrictions. Permits are required for public meetings or
 demonstrations, but these are routinely granted except when
 they have an overtly political purpose.
 Political parties are banned in Ghana, and meetings to
 organize such parties are prohibited. The Government barred
 persons with close ties to the old parties from running as
 candidates for election to the district assemblies.
 For a discussion of freedom of association as it applies to
 labor unions, see Section 6.a.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 There is no state-favored religion and no restriction on the
 exercise of religion. Organized religious groups may establish
 places of worship, train their clergy, and participate in
 charitable activities. Ghanaians are predominantly Christian,
 and many senior government officials are practicing members of
 
 
 139
 GHANA
 various Protestant sects or Roman Catholicism with no
 particular advantages or disadvantages attached to membership.
 The PNDC encourages religious communities to support its
 economic and social policies. It has been sensitive to church
 criticism of Ghana's human rights record, and in 1987 Chairman
 Rawlings renewed the charge that worldwide church and Christian
 organizations may be havens for foreign spy networks. Foreign
 missionary groups operate throughout the country with a
 minimum of formal restrictions, although some foreign
 missionaries find obtaining visas is becoming more difficult.
 Foreign evangelists have come under criticism. Religious
 groups such as the Jehovah's Witnesses, which advocate refusal
 to recognize Ghanaian symbols of authority, have been strongly
 criticized by the Government. In addition, some-local
 congregations have been closed down by the Government because
 of excesses deemed offensive "to the morals of the average
 Ghanaian."
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Ghanaians and foreigners are fzee to move throughout Ghana
 without special permission. Police checkpoints exist
 countrywide, allegedly for the prevention of smuggling, but
 are less obtrusive than in the 1982-84 period. Roadblocks and
 car searches are still a normal part of nighttime travel in
 Accra.
 As members of the Economic Community of West African States
 (ECOWAS), Ghanaians may travel without visas for up to 90 days
 in member states. Ghanaians are generally free to exercise
 this right, and nationals of other member states are free to
 travel to Ghana. Ghanaians are also free to emigrate or to be
 repatriated from other countries. If a person is considered a
 security threat, special permission to travel outside Ghana
 must be obtained.
 There is no forced resettlement of populations. Unregistered
 refugees from the Sahelian drought in neighboring countries
 remain in Ghana, and efforts to settle these basically nomadic
 peoples have had only limited success. The Government launched
 "Operation Cowleg" in 1988, aimed at forcing alien herdsmen
 across the border by a certain deadline or suffer confiscation
 of their herds, which were blamed for damaging irrigation
 channels and denuding the land. The operation was claimed to
 be successful, although the problem may still persist. The
 Government has not established policies to deal with the
 roughly 150 refugees registered with the United Nations High
 Commissioner for Refugees, but they do not constitute a
 significant problem.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Chairman Rawlings and the PNDC exercise total executive, -
 legislative, judicial, and administrative power in Ghana.
 There is no procedure by which citizens can freely and
 peacefully change their laws, officials, or form of government.
 The National Commission for Democracy (NCD) was established in
 1984 to design new "democratic" structures which would
 establish the legitimacy of the PNDC.
 In December the first elections since 1979 were held in Ghana
 to establish district assemblies in four regions. Elections
 
 
 140
 GHANA
 for district assemblies in the remaining six regions were
 scheduled for January and February 1989. No plans have been
 announced for regional or national elections. All national
 and regional officials are appointed by the PNDC.
 Women are officially encouraged to play a greater role in the
 political and social development of Ghana, and several women
 hold prominent supporting positions in the PNDC.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government is sensitive to charges concerning its human
 rights practices, which it stoutly defends. In September a
 prominent government official attacked letter writers on human
 rights cases in Ghana as well-intentioned but ill-informed and
 singled out Amnesty International (AI) for specific criticism.
 The PNDC is particularly critical of charges from human rights
 groups in the West that it lacks a democratic structure,
 arguing that Western-style democracy has repeatedly failed in
 Ghana and that the current system involving "participatory
 democracy" through CDR's and other mass organizations has more
 .grassroots" support and is more broadly democratic than
 previous Ghanaian governments.
 No foreign human rights organization has asked recently to
 conduct any investigations in Ghana. There are no known
 locally organized human rights groups currently operating in
 Ghana, but several other organizations--most notably the Ghana
 Bar Association--attempts to address human rights issues from
 time to time.
 The Government cooperates with the International Committee of
 the Red Cross, and there is a chapter of AI in Ghana. In
 September 1988, Ghana was host to a meeting of the
 International Federation of Women Lawyers, which addressed
 human rights in Ghana. However, as far as is known, no other
 representatives of international human rights organizations
 visited Ghana in 1988.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Although ethnic differences are intentionally downplayed by
 the Government, occasional charges are aired that the PNDC and
 the political leadership are dominated by members of the Ewe
 ethnic group. Chairman Rawlings and a number of his close
 advisors are Ewe.
 The Government has made a concerted effort to raise the status
 of women in Ghana. In 1985 it promulgated four laws which
 overturned many of the discriminatory customary, traditional,
 and colonial laws; these concerned family accountability,
 intestate succession, customary divorce registrations, and the
 administration of estates. Women in urban centers and those
 who have entered modern society encounter little apparent
 bias, but role pressures persist. Women in the rural
 agricultural sector remain subject to stronger constraints
 associated with the traditional mores of male dominance.
 
 
 141
 GHANA
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 The PNDC has not interfered with the right of workers to
 associate in labor unions. Trade unions in Ghana and their
 activities are still governed by the Industrial Relations Act
 (IRA) of 1958, subsequently amended in 1965 and 1972.
 Organized labor in Ghana is represented by the independent
 Trades Union Congress (TUC), established in 1958.' It consists
 of a national headquarters and 16 affiliated unions,
 representing a claimed total membership of over 700,000
 workers in skilled and semiskilled trades. Union members
 elect their own leaders, and representatives of the affiliated
 unions elect the TUC leadership at quadrennial conferences,
 the most recent being in March. The TUC publishes its own
 newspaper. It is independent of government subventions and
 has publicly criticized the Government at times for its
 economic policies as well as its failure to adequately consult
 the trade union movement.
 The right to strike is recognized in law and in practice,
 although the Government has on occasion taken strong action to
 end strikes, especially those which threaten interests it
 perceives as vital. Under the IRA, the Government has
 established a system under which it seeks first to conciliate,
 then arbitrate, disputes. Discussions have been under way for
 some time to replace this system with labor tribunals to
 arbitrate industrial disputes certified as deadlocked, but the
 Government has declared that establishment of labor tribunals
 must be part of a new, consolidated industrial relations act,
 which cannot be implemented piecemeal.
 The TUC represents Ghanaian workers in the meetings of the
 International Labor Organization (ILO) and is affiliated to
 the Organization of African Trade Union Unity (OATUU).
 Consistent with OATUU guidelines, it maintains no other
 international affiliations, although it has friendly relations
 with other international labor organizations, including the
 International Confederation of-Free Trade Unions and the World
 Federation of Trade Unions.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 The right to organize is generally respected, although civil
 servants are prohibited by law from joining or organizing a
 trade union. The TUC is a large, well-established union
 organization whose membership has shown little growth in
 recent years, largely due to a stagnant economy which has
 produced few new jobs. Ghana's trade unions engage in
 collective bargaining for wages and benefits with both private
 and state-owned enterprises, though in the latter category the
 threat of detention (a common practice in the early 1980's)
 hangs over union leaders to force agreement on issues. At the
 end of 1988, no union leaders were under detention for
 union-related activities. There are no functioning export
 processing zones in Ghana, and labor legislation is applied
 uniformly throughout the country.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Ghanaian law prohibits forced labor, and it is not known to be
 practiced.
 
 
 142
 GHANA
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 Labor legislation in Ghana sets a minimum employment age of 15
 and prohibits night work and certain types of hazardous labor
 for those under 18. In practice, child labor is prevalent,
 and young children of school age can often be found during the
 day performing menial tasks in-the market or collecting fares
 on local buses. Enforcement of minimum age laws is uneven,
 especially since local custom and economic circumstances favor
 children working to help their families. Violators of
 regulations prohibiting heavy labor and night work for children
 are occasionally punished.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 -Minimum dtandards for wages and working conditions are
 established through a tripartite committee composed of
 representatives of government, labor, and employees. It
 establfishes a minimum wage rate, and other salaries are
 adjusted accordingly. Effective January 1987, the minimum
 wage was increased 25 percent to $0.50 per working day at
 current exchange rates. In early 1988, the TUC called for a
 "meaningful" national wage of not less than $4.00 per day.
 The existing minimum wage is insufficient for a single wage
 earner to support a family. In most cases, however, households
 are supported by multiple wage earners, some family farming,
 and other family based commercial activities. The tripartite
 committee was unable to agree on a cost-of-living study, and
 no minimum wage increase was mandated, although the TUC was
 authorized to enter into collective bargaining with private
 and state-owned enterprises anyway. The basic workweek in
 Ghana is 40 hours. Occupational safety and health regulations
 are in effect, and sanctions are occasionally applied to
 violators.
