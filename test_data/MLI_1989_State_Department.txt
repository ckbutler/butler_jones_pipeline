 MAILT
 Mali is a single-party state in which effective authority is
 exercised by Ge4eral Moussa Traore, President of the Republic
 and Secretary Genpral of the Democratic Union of the Malian
 people (UPDM), the country's only legal political party and
 supreme political entity. President Traore assumed power
 through a. military coup in 1968, and under his leadership the
 military Government adopted a new Constitution in 1974. Since
 then, the military have retained a privileged position, but
 civilians have an increasingly important role in daily
 government operations and in the party. Military men continue
 to occupy 4 of the 7 regional governorships, 11 of the 46
 districts, and an important number of lower level
 administrative posts, particularly in the border areas.
 Mali maintainsan army and air force, which provide both
 external and internal security. The gendarmerie (paramilitary
 police) assists in maintaining internal security.
 With an annual per capita gross national product of
 approximately $190, Mali is among the world's poorest
 countries. Mali is landlocked and lacks major mineral
 resources. Itseconomy rests on subsistence farming and
 animal husbandry. Good rainfalls for the second year in a row
 increased agricultural production and permitted some export of
 grains. However, it is too zoon to say whether the cycle of
 drought and economic depression that has affected Mali in
 recent decades is over. Malnutrition, poor food distribution
 systems, and widespread unemployment remain persistent
 problems. Throughout 1989 the Government continued its
 efforts to mpdernize the economy, particularly through fiscal
 reform and privatization of state.enterprises, but Mali
 remains heavily dependent on external aid.
 Human rights remained circumscribed in Mali in 1989. The
 Government did permit publication of an independent newspaper
 and the establishment of a nongovernmental human rights
 organization. The infamous Taodenit prison remained closed.
 However, security authorities mistreated several students and
 held them incommunicado for several months for distributing
 pamphlets. Significant human rights problems included
 arbitrary detention, abuse of detainees, and restrictions on
 fair trial, freedoms of speech, press, and association, the
 right of citizens to change their government through
 democratic means, and worker rights.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN.RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 No politically motivated killings were reported.
 b.. Disappearance
 No incidents of disappearance, abduction, or hostage-taking
 were reported.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 The Government has issued specific instructions prohibiting
 brutality against suspects. However, physical abuse of
 
 
 212
 MALI
 suspected persons sometimes occurs during police interrogation
 or in confronting demonstrations. In 1989 authorities accused
 eight students of distributing political tracts and held them
 in incommunicado detention for 2 months. According to
 credible sources., they were seriously mistreated, and at least
 one of the students was tied and suspended by his hands for a
 prolonged period while undergoing interrogation. No officials
 were prosecuted or even reprimanded for these actions.
 Prison conditions are harsh and characterized by inadequate
 medical facilities and food supplies. Mali's most infamous
 prison--Taodenit--was closed in 1988. In the past, the
 abysmal conditions at Taodenit contributed to the deaths of
 prisoners, including political prisoners held there. Amnesty
 International has called for a full and independent inquiry
 into the Taodenit deaths.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The Malian judicial system is based on the French model.
 Detained persons do not have the right to a judicial
 determination of the legality of their detention, but arrests
 cannot be made without formal charges. In political cases,
 the authorities do not always follow this practice, and
 incommunicado detention is sometimes utilized, as in the case
 of the eight students. Malian law does not provide for
 release on bail, but detainees are sometimes released on their
 own recognizance. Administrative backlogs often cause delays
 in bringing people to trial. Detainees are usually allowed
 access to a lawyer of their choice.
 With regard to forced or compulsory labor, see Section 6.c.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 A part of the executive branch, the judiciary is not
 independent. The Ministry of Justice supervises both law
 enforcement and judicial functions. The Supreme Court is the
 highest court, with both judicial and administrative powers.
 The National Assembly can convene a high court of justice to
 hear cases against state ministers, but this court did not
 meet during 1989.
 The eight students mentioned above were finally charged in
 August under a statute prohibiting the distribution of
 politically inflammatory material. When their case came to
 trial, seven were acquitted, and the court suspended the
 sentence of the one student who was found guilty.
 Corruption remains a major political issue, and trials against
 corrupt officials continued in 1989, notably in the Special
 Court of State Security, a military court. The Special Court
 met in June and heard 47 cases. Of the 72 persons found
 guilty of corruption, 30 were sentenced to life imprisonment
 and 7 received death sentences. In the Special Court,
 defendants usually admit guilt in the hope of receiving a more
 lenient sentence and allow their lawyers to argue mitigating
 circumstances. The verdict and sentence are rendered by a
 panel of three judges, including civilian judges and armed
 force officers. The death penalty is mandatory under the law
 for anyone convicted of embezzling more than $36,000.
 However, in most embezzlement trials restitution by the
 accused can decrease the severity of the sentence. Once
 convicted, a person can appeal for a presidential pardon or
 request a new trial. The right to request a presidential
 
 
 213
 MALI
 pardon or a new trial exists in mandatory death penalty cases.
 As far as is known, there were no political prisoners being
 held at the end of 1989.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Inviolability of the.home is provided for in the Constitution
 and generally respected in practice. Police searches are
 infrequent, and warrants are issued and recorded, though
 sometimes after the fact. Local authorities sometimes seize
 and open mail extralegally. Under the law, private letters
 can be opened only if the-country is facing political crisis.
 In sudh cases, the only organization which may legally open
 personal mail is the "Securite d'Etat," a special intelligence
 service responsible to the Presidency.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. ,Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Malian Constitution does not expressly provide for freedom
 of speech 4nd press. Malians take care to express criticism
 of the Government in accepted forums. In theory, criticism is
 permitted within-the councils -of the sole political party,
 which all citizens are encouraged, but not-forced, to join.
 Questioning of government authority outside party
 deliberations is rare, although not expressly forbidden.
 The Government controls most Malian media, which reflect
 official-positions. In some instances media and public
 criticism of specific programs and of the performance of some
 government officials is allowed. An independent biweekly
 newspaper, Les Echos, which often contains sharp political
 commentary, began publication in 1989. Independent specialty
 magazines such as Jamana (a cultural publication) and Podium
 (a sports journal) also contain some political commentary and
 circulate freely. International publications, including those
 having articles critical of Mali and its Government, are
 available. Satire and social criticism, sometimes with a
 political cast, are oqcasionally evident in Malian government
 publications. Government authorities generally seize
 political tracts printed by organizations not formally
 recognized by the Government.
 Academic freedom does not include the right to criticize the
 Government, nor is this right-extended.to the only recognized
 labor union, which is considered an arm of the Government.
 The union has, however, occasionally been critical of
 government policy. -
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Constitution provides for the right of citizens to form
 organizations to protect their professional interests, but in
 reality only selected nonpolitical organizations such as urban
 professional associations qualify. The primary groups which
 assemble freely are the women's, youth, and similar
 associations of Mali's single political party. In 1989 a
 number of apolitical "amicales" or friendship groups
 sponsoring exchanges with foreign countries were established,
 but these associations do not have an overt political agenda.
 
 
 214
 For a discussion of freedom of association as it applies to
 labor unions, see Section 6.a.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Mali is a secular state. The Government generally does not
 discriminate on religious grounds. Although 90 percent of
 Malians are Muslim, most other religions may practice their
 faiths freely and are permitted to establish houses of worship
 as well as schools. Christian missionaries of various faiths
 enjoy government cooperation. Proselytizing and conversion
 are permitted, except in the case of the Bahali, who may
 practice at home but may not proselytize or establish houses
 of worship. The Government prohibits publications in which
 one religious group defames another.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 -Freedom of movement in Mali is generally unimpeded, although
 police checks sometimes occur in which Malians and foreigners
 alike are stopped, particularly at night. These checks are
 used ostensibly to restrict the movement of contraband goods
 and to check vehicle registrations. In practice, some police
 probably supplement their frequently delayed salaries by
 assessing ad hoc fines or confiscating goods. Malians are
 free to change residence or workplace. Foreign travel
 requires an exit visa, which is easy to obtain. Repatriation
 is not restricted.
 In the-past-drought.years, Mali both-accepted and generated
 displaced -persons.- Several thousand Malians were repatriated
 from Algeria in 1986 and 1987. In 1989 Mali agreed to accept
 additional repatriates from Algeria. Mali also permitted
 entry to a number of persons who were expelled from
 neighboring Mauritania.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Citizens have no ability to change their-government and only
 limited and infrequent opportunity to influence it. Important
 policies and decisions are made by a small group--the
 President, the 19-member Central Executive Bureau of the UDPM,
 and the Council of Ministers. The memberships of these groups
 overlap. The military role in qoverning Mali remains
 important, but civilian participation in the leadership groups
 has been growing. Party congresses are called by the
 President to consider special issues.
 Within the one-party system, multiple candidates often contest
 party elections at the local level, but for National Assembly
 elections, which are held every 4 years, only one carefully
 selected party candidate nuns for each seat. Proposed
 legislation is debated and endorsed in the National Assembly
 after its acceptance by the Council of-14inisters and review by
 the Supreme Court. Party membership is a prerequisite for
 voting and for-holding a civil ervice-eppointment or other
 government position. All citizens-are -encouraged to join for
 a nominal fee.

 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 - Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government is generally responsive to inquiries by
 recognized human rights groups, although it apparently has not
 replied to Amnesty International's call for an inquiry into
 Taodenit prison. In 1989 the Government permitted the
 establishment of a nongovernmental human rights organization,
 The Malian Association for Human Rights. This organization
 sponsored a number of seminars on human rights issues in 1989
 and is attempting to encourage Malian participation in
 international human rights meetings.
 Sectidn 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Mali does not practice-religious or ethnic discrimination,-nor
 does it have the civil and racial strife evident in many other
 multiethnic countries. Virtually all of Mali's ethnic groups,
 are represented at the highest state and party levels.
 Although som -nomadic groups such as the Tamashek are not
 completely integrated into the economic and political
 mainstream, Mali is relatively free of ethnic tensions.
 Social and cultural factors place;men in the dominant position
 in Mali. However, women play an important economic role, both
 in market life and in farming. There are a.number of women in
 tbhe professions, but economic opportunity for educated women
 -is limited. Women live -nder-harsh conditions, especially in
 the rural areas.
 Violence against women, including wife beating, is accepted in
 Malian society, but there are no statistics to indicate how
 widespread it may be. Malian society generally does not
 tolerate spousal abuse that results in physical injury, but
 legal action for redress of injury is not normally available.
 The issue of spousal abuse has not been addressed by the
 Government. Nor is the National Union of Malian Women (UNFM)
 actively engaged in this issue. The UNFM focuses primarily on
 establishing cooperatives, improvingxhealth programs, and
 fostering.-education. It also campaigns against female
 circumcision,=which-is still widely practiced in Mali,
 including the &most extreme form of genital mutilation,
 infibulation.- The Government has taken no public position on
 this issue.
 ,Traditional~practice and existing Malian laws place women at a
 disadvantage with regard to family law and-:property rights. A
 group.of female jurists is seeking improved legal protection
 for women. One issue being addressed by-this group pertains
 -to rights of widows. Curmently, a widow has no right to her
 husband's property or custody of children conceived during the
 marriage.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. -The fight of Association
 The Constitution specifically provides for the liberty of
 citizens to form organizations to protect their "professional
 interests." However, workers' right of association is limited
 to the National Union of Malian Workers (UNTM). The UNTM
 
 
 216
 MALI
 comprises 12 unions and is Mali's only recognized workers'
 organization. At present, there are no unions not affiliated
 with the UNTM. The UNT4 claims to maintain a degree of
 autonomy from the Government, and unlike the women's and youth
 associations, it is not officially part of the party. It has
 on occasion offered limited criticism of certain government
 programs. Nevertheless, it is subject to considerable
 government influence and control, and the UNTM Secretary
 General is a party member, although not a member of the
 Central Executive Council of the UDPM.
 Strikes are rarely permitted, and those deemed to be taken for
 political reasons are illegal. Given Mali's high level of
 unemployment, most workers are reluctant to strike for long
 periods of time. By law, any union planning to go on strike
 must notify the UNTM and obtain prior approval. In the case
 of student and teacher strikes which took place in 1988, no
 approval was given, but the strikes still took place and many
 participants suffered reprisals. The International Labor
 Organization's (ILO) Committee on Freedom of Association
 concluded that the resulting government-directed transfers,
 dismissals, and arrests of teachers constituted an infringement
 on their freedom of association. Malian teachers continue to
 have grievances, specifically over the nonpayment of
 salaries. There were no teacher strikes in 1989, but there
 were work slowdowns. In September drivers of minibuses in
 Bamako protested government attempts to impose stricter
 regulations on their activities. When there was no response
 to a complaint lodged through the transport union, drivers
 organized a 1-day protest strike. There were no government
 reprisals.
 The UNTM maintains contacts with international labor
 organizations, both public and private. The UNTM is affiliated
 with two international labor bodies: the Organization of West
 African Workers and the Organization of African Trade Union
 Unity.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 There are no specific constraints by the Government or
 employers on workers attempting to organize, but in practice,
 Mali's unitary party system effectively inhibits the workers'
 right to organize. True collective bargaining does not take
 place. The UNTM has a policy role in the agreements
 negotiated by the individual member unions, and the
 Government, through the Minister of Labor, must approve all
 wage and related agreements.
 There are no export processing zones in Mali.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 The Constitution prohibits forced or compulsory labor, and
 this prohibition is generally observed in practice. There
 have been reports that a form of traditional slavery is still
 practiced in some isolated parts of the country.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 The minimum age for employment is 14, but with parents'
 permission children can be apprenticed at 12. In practice,
 children in rural areas join the family farming work force at
 a much younger age. As workers in-the informal sector, they
 are not protected by laws against unjust compensation,
 
 
 217
 MALT
 excessive hours, and capricious discharge.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 Mali has a detailed labor code specifying conditions of
 employment, including hours, wages, and social security
 benefits. The normal workweek is 44 hours. The minimum wage
 is approximately $42.50 per month, which could provide a
 decent standard of living if it went to support only one
 person. However, most wage earners support extended
 families. Health and safety standards vary, depending upon
 the category of works but there is limited enforcement due to
 the lack of inspectors. Employers are required to pay into a
 national social security fund.
