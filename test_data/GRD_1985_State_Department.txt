 GRENADA
 Grenada is once again governed under the parliamentary system
 it had on acquiring independence from the United Kingdom in
 1974. Free and fair democratic elections were held in
 December 1984, a little over a year after the October 1983
 landing of United States and Eastern Caribbean countries put
 an end to the chaotic conditions which followed the murder of
 Prime Minister Maurice Bishop by his former associates. In
 the elections, contested by three parties, the New National
 Party (NNP) led by Herbert Blaize won 14 of 15 seats in
 Parliament, and Blaize was elected Prime Minister.
 Among its first acts in January 1985, Parliament restored the
 1974 Independence Constitution and legitimized the court
 system inherited from its predecessors who had ruled by
 decree. Political and civil rights are fully guaranteed by
 the Government. The spectrum of political parties is composed
 of the moderate NNP and Grenada Democratic Labour Party (GDLP)
 (which was formed in February 1985 following the election),
 the Marxist Maurice Bishop Patriotic Movement (MBPM)
 (organized by the pro-Bishop survivors of the October 19, 1983
 anti-Bishop coup), and the Grenada United Labour Party (GULP)
 of Former Prime Minister Gairy.
 During 1985, security in Grenada was partially maintained by
 the Caribbean Peacekeeping Force (CPF) composed of military
 and police contingents from neighboring countries, with United
 States military support. The last U.S. forces left the island
 on June 11, 1985, and the remnants of the CPF departed in
 September. Internal security in Grenada is now the sole
 responsibility of the Royal Grenada Police Force (RGPF) which
 includes an 80-man paramilitary Special Services Unit, which
 received training from U.S. military advisors until September,
 1985.
 The Grenadian economy is gradually recovering from years of
 mismanagement, political turmoil, and an inadequate,
 dilapidated infrastructure. The Government has introduced
 reforms to promote development and encourage investment.
 In 1985, the NNP governed with full respect for the law and in
 accordance with international standards of human rights,
 including protection of the integrity of the person. Judicial
 proceedings follow accepted standards of due process, and
 those accused of murdering former Prime Minister Bishop and
 others were accorded the full scope of judicial protections.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There were no reports of politically motivated killings in
 Grenada in 1985.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances
 or abductions in Grenada in 1985.

 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Several of those being held and tried for the murders of
 Maurice Bishop and others have complained of torture and cruel
 treatment while imprisoned. When prisoners made allegations
 of torture, physicians were called in and on no occasion were
 these allegations substantiated.
 During the initial sessions of the trial in 1985, defense
 attorneys repeated claims of torture and maltreatment of the
 19 accused, which they alleged were committed with the consent
 and complicity of the Commissioner of Prisons. Although there
 were instances of abusive treatment by individual guards, no
 evidence has ever been provided to substantiate claims of
 systematic abuse or official complicity.
 Observers from an impartial international organization
 investigating prison conditions in August 1985 found, after
 talking with the 19 accused, 3 instances of legitimate
 complaint: 3 of them claimed to need medical attention; 2
 said they were denied the right to correspond with their minor
 children; and the I woman among the 19 was allowed virtually
 no contact with the other prisoners, including her husband.
 Government authorities state that the accused have had access
 to physicians but that the prisoners have insisted on seeing
 those of their own choice. (Eventually this was allowed.)
 Correspondence was also permitted, the authorities asserted,
 as was contact with visitors by the woman prisoner.
 Later in August, the defense filed a motion in the trial
 claiming the accused were denied proper access to their
 attorneys, and they renewed the allegations of torture and
 arbitrary denial of privileges. An affidavit included
 allegations of beatings, public humiliation, mental torture,
 intense interrogation, and the denial of medical treatment,
 especially during the period of confinement while being
 supervised by U.S. and Caribbean forces between October 1983
 and early 1984. This motion has not yet been heard in court.
 On August 23, 1985, the prosecution and defense agreed on a
 consent order, issued by the Chief Justice, which ordered the
 Prison Commissioner to assure the accused liberal access to
 their lawyers and to writing materials, freedom to correspond
 with persons outside the prison, 10-1/2 hours of freedom to
 exercise per day, and freedom on a daily basis to associate
 among themselves. After some controversy on whether the writ
 was fully implemented, the defense stated in court in October
 that it was fully satisfied that the prison authorities were
 implementing the consent order.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 There were no reports of arbitrary arrests in Grenada in
 1985. Grenadian police, by law, have the right to arrest
 individuals "on suspicion" without a warrant, but arrests must
 be accompanied by formal charges. In 1985, no one was
 detained for political reasons.
 Those arrested are brought before an independent judiciary.
 They are allowed access to a lawyer of their choice and, for
 capital crimes, the courts appoint lawyers when the accused
 cannot pay for their defense. The 19 accused of murdering
 
 
 536
 GRENADA
 Maurice Bishop and others are defended by 12 Jamaican lawyers
 of their choosing, all but 2 of whom are remunerated by the
 Grenadian Government.
 There is a functioning system of bail, although those charged
 with any capital offense are not eligible. Grenadian law
 provides for writs of habeas corpus. Following a
 determination by a judicial hearing that there is sufficient
 evidence to substantiate a criminal charge, there is a 15-day
 period during which the defense may apply for judicial
 determination of the legality of a person's imprisonment, and
 a 2-month period during which a person in detention must be
 charged or released. These time limits were respected during
 1985. People who have been charged can be held on remand for
 only a specified time while awaiting trial. This time limit
 is not always strictly adhered to because there are too few
 judges and other officials in the judiciary to process the
 caseload expeditiously.
 No Grenadian citizen was exiled in 1985, although some members
 of the Peoples Revolutionary Government (PRG) have remained
 outside the country voluntarily.
 There was no forced labor in Grenada in 1985.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Tria'l
 Grenadians have the right to fair public trials, under law and
 in practice. The Bishop murder trial has been subject to a
 series of delays, in large part caused by the defense
 exercising its rights to file appeals and motions. One such
 motion, claiming the 19 cannot receive a fair trial in Grenada
 because of pretrial publicity, was filed in September 1985 and
 has not yet been heard.
 Chester Humphrey was charged in the United States for
 smuggling weapons to Grenada in the late seventies. He fled
 the United States to return to Grenada where he was heralded a
 leading member of the New Jewel Movement (NJM). Following the
 1983 rescue mission, Humphrey was detained in Grenada while
 the Grenadian courts reviewed a request for extradition to the
 United States. Although Humphrey claimed he was physically
 abused, these allegations were never substantiated. Humphrey
 went on several hunger strikes but received medical attention
 whenever required. In January 1986, the Grenada Court of
 Appeals, after a thorough review of the case, determined that
 Humphrey could not be extradited for the charges contained in
 the U.S. extradition request. Humphrey was released.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home,
 or Correspondence
 There is no arbitrary interference by the State or any
 political organization in the private life of individuals.
 There is no forced membership in any organization and no
 arbitrary monitoring of telephones or correspondence.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Grenadians are free to say and publish what they want, and
 they did so in 1985. There are five weekly newspapers, two of
 which are independent. Three are affiliated with political
 
 
 537
 GRENADA
 parties. In addition, a local journalist publishes a
 newsletter irregularly, and the remnants of the Revolutionary
 Military Council on occasion distribute a flier, "The
 Revolution." Newspapers freely criticize the Government.
 There have been no suits for libel or slander.
 There is one radio station in Grenada, the government-run
 "Radio Grenada AM." A second station, "Radio La Baye FM,"
 operated for one week in 1985 before being closed by the
 Government for not having a license to broadcast. The owner
 claimed he did have a license, but he possessed only a letter
 from the Prime Minister's office encouraging him to apply for
 one. The owner was arrested and charged with operating
 without a license and also with importing broadcasting
 equipment on a false customs declaration. The case has not
 yet been heard.
 There is a nascent television broadcasting system on Grenada,
 organized by a U.S.-based private foundation. The television
 capability was developed with the cooperation of the Grenada
 Government. The future of the television facility is under
 discussion between the foundation and the Government.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Grenadians enjoy the right to assemble for any purpose,
 including the public protest of policies or actions of the
 Government. Supporters of political parties, including those
 which were in power prior to October 1983, meet frequently and
 hold public rallies. There are no controls on private or
 public associations, and permits are not required for public
 meetings. On one occasion the Government did attempt to
 prohibit the MBPM from using a public park for a rally, but it
 took place anyway, with no arrests or repercussions against
 the organizers.
 Workers are free to organize independent labor unions and to
 participate in collective bargaining. Unions play a
 significant role in the Grenadian political process, with
 approximately 25 percent of the total work force belonging to
 unions. They can and do strike the public sector legally if
 they give advance notification. In 1985, all unions were free
 of government control, and none was given government support.
 Individual unionists are active in politics but must separate
 their private political involvement from their union
 activities. The Grenada Trades Union Council (TUC)
 participates in the conferences of the International Labor
 Organization (ILO) and is affiliated with the International
 Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) via the Caribbean
 Congress of Labour (CCL). Some CCL leaders boycotted the
 organization's 25th anniversary meeting in Grenada because
 they felt some of the leaders of the Grenada TUC were too
 close to the nondemocratic left wing.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 The predominant faiths are Roman Catholic and Anglican there
 are many Presbyterians and Methodists as well as Evangelical
 church members. There is complete religious freedom, which
 extends to non-Christians such as Rastafarians, who were
 harassed under the previous regime. Clergy, including
 missionaries, travel and preach freely. There do not appear
 to be advantages or disadvantages conferred by adherence to a
 particular faith, although Christian prayers and hymns are
 part of many governmental and political meetings.

 GRENADA
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 There is freedom of movement within Grenada, and the right to
 enter and leave is guaranteed to all Grenadian citizens.
 Emigration was not restricted in 1985, and all Grenadian
 citizens who left the islands were able freely to return.
 There were no "repatriates" forcibly returned to Grenada in
 1985, nor any official cases of refugees who have come to
 Grenada. (There is a Ba'hai community that has included
 Iranians who left their homeland to escape persecution). The
 Government has allowed students and others to return from Cuba
 and other Communist countries.
 In one case the Government denied a citizen the right to a
 specific trip abroad. An organizer for the MBPM had his
 passport seized, an action which was upheld by the Chief
 Justice on the strength of government evidence that the
 subject would engage in activities harmful to the State if
 allowed to travel abroad. The decision has been appealed.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 The Constitution guarantees free and fair elections at least
 every 5 years. The majority party in Grenada's Parliament is
 the New National Party (NNP) under the leadership of Prime
 Minister Herbert Blaize. Formed by the union of three parties
 in August 1984, the NNP represents a cross-section of
 Grenada's population. It was voted into office in December
 1984 in elections in which 85 percent of eligible voters
 participated. The election, according to international
 observers, was free and fair and without violence. The NNP
 won 14 of the 15 Parliamentary seats, and the Grenada United
 Labour Party won one seat (its holder left the GULP to form
 his own party, the Grenada Democratic Labour Party, in
 February 1985). The Maurice Bishop Patriotic Movement
 obtained only about 4 percent of the vote.
 The political system is not dominated by any particular ethnic
 group, nor are there any restrictions which limit
 participation of any elements of the Grenadian population.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The present Government has welcomed visits of several human
 rights organizations, as did the Interim Council which
 preceded it. In February 1985 a representative of the
 International Committee of the Red Cross spent 7 days in
 Grenada, following up on a visit of July 1984. He inspected
 prison conditions, interviewed the Commissioner of Prisons,
 spoke with the 19 individuals indicted in the Bishop murder
 trial, and met with Government officials. A representative of
 Amnesty International also visited the island to observe
 judicial procedures and examine prison conditions.
 There are no active internal human rights organizations in
 Grenada.
 
 
 GRENADA
 Amnesty International in its 1985 report (which covers events
 in 1984) expressed concern about the detention without charge
 of members of the People's Revolutionary Government, as well
 as allegations of mistreatment of those accused of the murder
 of Prime Minister Bishop and his followers. Freedom House
 rated Grenada as "free."
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 The World Bank estimates Grenada's 1985 population at 93,000
 with a growth rate of 0.8 percent. The estimated per capita
 income is $930 per year.
 Grenada's economy has been improving slowly since its negative
 performance in 1983. The Interim Council and the Government
 of Prime Minister Blaize have embarked on a series of reforms
 to reduce unemployment by freeing the economy from those
 government controls which hinder development and by
 encouraging legitimate local and foreign investors. To date,
 the investment code has been revised, an industrial
 development corporation established, exchange controls
 reduced, many price controls lifted, and some state
 enterprises privatized. This process is continuing as the
 Government prepares to review proposals for the privatization
 of further state enterprises and to consider various tax
 reform options. Most foreign assistance is targeted at the
 improvement of Grenada's economic infrastructure and the
 diversification of agriculture. There are no reliable
 estimates, but unemployment is about 27 percent, with most
 unemployed in the 16 to 25-year-old age group.
 The World Bank estimated infant mortality at 21.2 per 1,000
 live births and the crude birth rate at 31.4 per 1,000. The
 Government estimates illegitimacy to be 80 percent of all
 births. Life expectancy is 70.8 years. Voluntary outward
 migration is the major factor that keeps Grenada's population
 at a relatively stable level. On the basis of these
 statistics, it is estimated that at least 32,000 people have
 emigrated from Grenada between 1970 and 1983, with emigration
 accelerating greatly during the PRG years. The estimated
 gross national product for 1984 was $86.26 million. Income
 distribution is more even than in most developing countries,
 although a small group of traders in St. George's, the
 capital, have incomes well above those in other sectors of the
 society.
 A basic level of health care is available to all Grenadians,
 and the standard of care has been raised considerably with
 assistance from abroad. However, according to Project Hope
 officials who work with the Ministry of Health, a significant
 health care problem is the lack of trained Grenadian personnel
 willing to stay and work in Grenada. Medical care facilities,
 including a general hospital, six health centers, and several
 .,visiting stations," are found throughout the islands. They
 are not always in good repair, and medical equipment is
 frequently old or unusable. Methods of recording births,
 deaths, and diseases are not standardized, making it difficult
 to rely on local statistics to estimate the extent to which
 the population's health needs are met.
 Adult literacy, according to the World Bank, was 97.8 percent
 in 1979 although that figure appears high. Functional
 illiteracy is high among youths and was unofficially estimated
 at 30 percent in 1980. There is compulsory education for all
 
 
 540
 GRENADA
 children between the ages of 5 and 16, but daily attendance
 varies greatly and is not enforced. All the urban population
 and 77 percent of the rural population had access to safe
 water in 1975. This may have declined slightly by 1985 due to
 chronic problems of water distribution in the urban area
 around the capital. The ratio of calorie supply available for
 consumption was almost 90 percent (1977) of nutritional
 requirements. Although it is estimated that malnutrition is
 not a significant problem in Grenada, due in part to the
 fertility of the land and availability of fruits, vegetables,
 and fish to even the poorest, there are high levels of
 gastroenteritis.
 The employment of persons under 16 of age in industry is
 prohibited by statute, although industry is a very small
 sector of the economy. Minors do work in family-run shops and
 farms, a much larger sector. There is no regulation of work
 hours or minimum wage law although the Government has acted as
 a model in setting wage rate standards. There are no laws
 dealing with occupational safety, but common law does allow
 employers to be sued for negligence.
 While there is no formal government-sanctioned discrimination
 against women in Grenada, they frequently are paid less than
 men performing the same work. "Skilled" jobs for women such
 as spice processing also tend to be the lowest paid jobs. In
 more highly paid work, women tend to be equally paid, although
 there are fewer women in such positions. Two of the 14
 members of Parliament and 4 of the 7 top-level civil servants,
 permanent secretaries, are women.
