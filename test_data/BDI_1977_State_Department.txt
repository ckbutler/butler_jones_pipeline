 BURUNDI
 Social conflict between the majority (85 percent) Hutu
 ethnic group and the minority (14 percent) Tutsi group,
 has dominated the political, social and economic life of
 Burundi. While there are no important linguistic or
 cultural differences between these two ethnic elements,
 ancient social cleavages have contributed to an intense -
 at times fierce - competitive struggle for national pre-
 dominance. An attempted coup in April in 1972 by the
 majority Hutu against the Tutsi government resulted in a
 aovernment-sanctioned bloodbath that left 150.000 dead
 and an equal number of refugees. The new'government-under
 Colonel Jean Baptiste Bagaza has developed a.strong
 policy of national reconciliation and reform designed
 to involve the Hutus much more fully in the political,
 social and economic life of the nation.
 1.   Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a.   Torture
 Torture is not part of the police interrogation practices in
 Burundi. Some brutality occurs during the questioning of
 common criminals, particularly if they have threatened
 violence against the police or used force in their alleged
 crimes.
 b.   Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 The current system does not impose cruel, inhuman or de-
 grading treatment or punishment. However, the ethnic
 massacres and atrocities of the mid-sixties and early
 seventies are a recent memory and their specter lingers.
 Prisons are crowded and dirty, but prisoners are normally
 left to themselves and not abused.
 c.   Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 Arbitrary arrest and imprisonment do occur, largely
 because existing legal standards are poorly understood by
 enforcement agents.
 Several officials of the former regime remain under house-
 arrest. There are few, if any, other political prisoners.
 
 
 d.   Denial of Fair Public Trial
 By law, all persons arrested must undergo expeditious
 public trial, but in practice the inefficiencies of the
 judicial system and the lack of .trained legal personnel
 often cause long delays and a lack of fairness.
 e.   Invasion of the Home
 Invasion of the home is rare, but it occasionally happens
 in politically-related cases.
 2.    Governmental Policies Relating to the FuIfillment
 of Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care
 and Education
 The reform-minded new government has recognized that
 peace, economic growth and stability require much more
 attention to fulfilling the vital needs of its citizens.
 The new five year plan places special emphasis on increas-
 ing food production, controling population growth and
 ameliorating the full range of government social services
 in rural areas.
 Corruption is part of the Burundian way of life, as in
 many poor developing countries. The current government
 is trying to reduce corrupt practices and is preparing a
 triar of some eighty former officials and businessmen on
 corruption charges. The President himself has a reputation
 for scrupulous honesty.
 3.    Respect for Civil and Political Liberties Including:
 a.   Freedom of Thought, Speech, Religion, Press
 and Assembly
 Freedom of religion is generally respected in Burundi.
 However, missionaries' involvement in social work with
 the poor who are inevitably mainly Hutu, has on occasion
 aroused government suspicion, and in some instances has
 led to actual expulsions of foreign churchmen. Strictly
 religious work, however, has not been affected.
 There is no freedom of assembly or speech for political
 purposes without the express authorization of the govern-
 ment.
 The press and the labor movement are government-controlled.
 
 
 b.   Freedom of Movement Within the Country,
 Foreign Travel and Emigration
 Movement is free within Burundi, as is foreign travel
 and emigration.
 C.   Freedom to Participate in the Political
 Process
 The military government rules by decree, without popular
 referendum procedures. Only one political party -- the
 government-sponsored UPRONA -- is permitted.-Political
 activity is generally controlled b -'th'G6ieirnment.
 4.    Government Attitude and Record Regarding International
 and Non-Governmental Investigation of Alleged
 Violations of Human Rights
 The previous government was very sensitive to outside in-
 vestigation of the ethnic situation in Burundi after the
 communal violence of 1972-73 and refused to permit investi-
 gation. The present government has not had to face this
 issue, but it would likely not wish outsiders to assess
 its program on ethnic relations. Even though it is a
 positive program, public exposure and well-intentioned and
 helpful criticism would tend to exacerbate traditional
 sensitivities.
