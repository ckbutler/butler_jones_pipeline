 JAPAN
 Japan is a parliamentary democracy in which democratic
 institutions are firmly established. Its industrial free
 market economy is the second largest in the world in terms of
 gross national product. Japan's culture incorporates many
 elements from the West while retaining strong Eastern roots.
 Buddhist, Shinto, and Confucian traditions continue to have a
 basic and pervasive influence on thought and social
 institutions, but several minor religions also flourish. Less
 than 1 percent of the population is Christian. Although the
 Japanese are receptive to foreign ideas, the citizens of this
 densely populated nation have a cultural, ethnic, and racial
 homogeneity which makes them less willing to integrate alien
 residents in Japan into their society. While the legal system
 has gradually evolved toward granting equality of opportunity
 to minorities, there has been little change in the social
 prejudice against Koreans, around 680,000 of whom are first,
 second, and third generation permanent residents, in addition
 to the approximately 120,000 naturalized Japanese nationals of
 Korean ancestry. An estimated 1.2 million descendants of
 persons historically considered to be outcasts ("Burakumin")
 also suffer social but not legal discrimination.
 Additionally, there are reportedly over 24,000 descendants of
 Ainu, Japan's indigenous people, now concentrated in Hokkaido,
 who also claim social discrimination against them.
 The Japanese Constitution states, "All of the people are equal
 under the law and there shall be no discrimination in
 political, economic, or social relations because of race,
 creed, sex, social status, or family origin." The human
 rights guaranteed by the Constitution are secured by a just
 and efficient legal system. Political liberties are
 guaranteed to all nationals, and nearly 70 percent of the
 electorate usually vote in general elections, which involve
 candidates from six freely-functioning political parties. The
 right of workers to organize, bargain, and act collectively is
 guaranteed by the Constitution.
 The Equal Employment Opportunity Law, prohibiting
 discrimination in the workplace based on sex, took effect
 April 1, 1986, but has yet to have a significant impact on the
 employment practices of Japanese corporations.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Rerpect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There were no cases of murder for political motives on the
 part of the Government. In August there was an early morning
 attack by ultraleftist radicals connected with one union on
 leaders of rival unions, one of whom was killed. This attack,
 however, appears to have been related to an internal power
 struggle among these railway workers unions, and not a part of
 a larger campaign of political violence or intimidation.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no cases in which people were abducted, secretly
 arrested, held in clandestine detention, or held as hostage by
 security forces or any other organization.

 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Freedom from torture, and cruel, inhuman, or degrading
 treatment or punishment is guaranteed by the Constitution and
 respected in practice. There is no evidence that penal
 treatment varies by social class, sex, or religion.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Freedom from arbitrary arrest or imprisonment is guaranteed by
 the Constitution and respected in practice. Japanese law
 provides for judicial determination of the legality of
 detention. People cannot be detained without charge, and
 prosecuting authorities must be prepared to demonstrate before
 trial that probable cause exists to detain the accused. The
 length of time before a suspect is brought to trial depends on
 the nature of the crime, but rarely exceeds 2 months; the
 average is 1 to 2 months. Preventive detention does not
 exist.
 The key statute protecting workers, the Labor Standards Law of
 1947, prohibits the use of forced labor, and there are no
 known cases of forced or compulsory labor.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The Constitution guarantees the right to a speedy and public
 trial by an impartial tribunal in all criminal cases, and this
 right is respected in practice. The defendant is informed of
 charges upon arrest and guaranteed a public trial by an
 independent civilian court with defense counsel and the right
 to cross-examination. The Constitution guarantees defendants
 free and private access to counsel, although this right may be
 abridged in practice, as well as the right not to be compelled
 to testify against themselves. Defendants are also protected
 from the application of ex post facto laws and have the right
 of access to incriminating evidence after a formal indictment
 has been made and generally before trial. Judges are
 appointed by the Cabinet for permanent terms but face periodic
 review through popular referendum. A defendant who is
 dissatisfied with the decision of a trial court of first
 instance may, within the period prescribed by law, appeal to a
 higher court.   There is no trial by jury in Japan.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Under the Constitution, each search or seizure must be made
 upon separate warrant issued by a judicial officer. Japanese
 authorities have been scrupulous in observing the legal
 requirements for warrants. The standards for issuing such
 warrants exist to guard against arbitrary searches. There are
 no reports that the Government or any other organization has
 arbitrarily interfered with privacy, family, home, or
 correspondence.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Japanese Constitution, an independent press and judiciary,
 and a functioning democratic political system combine to
 ensure freedom of speech and press.

 JAPAN
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.
 These freedoms are guaranteed by the Constitution and
 respected in practice.
 The Constitution guarantees unions the right to organize,
 bargain, and act collectively. Japanese law also allows them
 to lobby and to make political campaign contributions. Unions
 actively engage in all of these. They are involved also in
 international bodies and bilateral exchanges. Slightly under
 30 percent of the active work force belong to labor unions.
 Public employees do not have the right to strike but do have
 recourse to mediation and arbitration in order to resolve
 disputes. Members of the armed forces, police officers, and
 firefighters are not permitted to organize. In exchange for a
 ban on their right to strike, government employees' pay raises
 are determined by the Government based on a recommendation by
 the independent National Personnel Authority (NPA). Citing
 tight finances, however, the Government in 1986, as in
 previous years, has not fully implemented the NPA
 recommendations for wage increases.
 In response to this, the General Council of Trade Unions of
 Japan (SOHYO) again has filed a complaint with the
 International Labor Organization (ILO). The ILO Committee on
 Freedom of Association has urged Japan to respect the NPA
 recommendations and also has asked that Japan establish new
 procedures for deciding wages and working conditions for
 government employees.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Freedom of religion is guaranteed by the Constitution and
 respected in practice. While Buddhism and Shintoism remain
 the two major religions, there are many others, including
 several Christian denominations. Missionaries are welcome and
 receive special visa status. Some temples and shrines, as
 treasured national properties, receive public support for
 maintenance.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation.
 Japanese citizens have the right to travel freely, both within
 Japan and abroad, to change their place of residence, to
 emigrate, and to repatriate voluntarily. Nationality is never
 revoked.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 As a parliamentary democracy, Japan is ruled by the political
 party or parties able to form a majority in the lower house of
 its bicameral Diet. The Liberal Democratic Party, which has
 been in power continuously since 1955, won a substantial
 parliamentary majority in the July 1986 national elections.
 Five opposition parties are active. All adult citizens have
 the right to vote by secret ballot. Political interest groups
 can organize and engage in nonviolent political activity
 regardless of political beliefs. Well-organized labor unions
 ensure participation by workers in the political process.

 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Various groups have petitioned the office of the United
 Nations Commission for Human Rights (UNHRC) to take up
 allegations of discrimination against Koreans in Japan and of
 maltreatment of mental patients. The Government responded to
 the complaints, and the UNHRC decided not to take up these
 matters for further discussion or investigation. The adequacy
 of the mental health system has been criticized by the
 International Commission of Jurists (ICJ), and the Government
 has taken some steps to improve mental health institutions.
 Through its membership in the UNHRC, the Government works for
 improvement of human rights practices in other countries.
 There is a Human Rights and Refugee Division in the Ministry
 of Foreign Affairs to give long-range attention to these
 matters.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 There are some 23.6 million women workers in Japan, comprising
 39.7 percent of the employed population. Discrimination by
 private employers against women is prohibited by the
 Constitution and by legislative measures adopted over the past
 30 years to accord women the same legal status as men. In
 April 1986, an equal employment opportunity law came into
 effect. This law is intended to eliminate sex discrimination
 in such areas as recruitment and hiring, pay inequality, and
 the amount of night or overtime hours that can be worked.
 However, the law has been criticized as containing no concrete
 measures, such as penalties for violators, to ensure equality
 for women workers. In any case, it appears that passage of
 this legislation will not change the prevailing social
 attitudes which discourage women from assuming positions of
 managerial responsibility. It is true that most women workers
 (86 percent according to one authoritative survey made in
 1985) have no interest in management positions and still
 prefer marriage and motherhood to careers. But those who do
 wish to pursue careers find many obstacles remaining in their
 way and are unlikely to advance as quickly as their male
 counterparts. Significant disparities remain between the
 salaries of men and women workers.
 As a homogeneous nation with a long tradition of isolation
 from other cultures, Japanese society is not willing to
 integrate alien residents despite its general receptivity to
 foreign ideas. Entrenched social prejudice against both
 Korean residents (most of whom were born, raised, and educated
 in Japan) and members of the "Burakumin" community
 (descendants of feudal era "outcasts" who practiced so-called
 "unclean" professions such as hide tanning) restricts the
 access of both groups to private housing, employment, and
 marriage opportunities.
 In recent years the Government has enacted several laws and
 regulations extending to permanent resident aliens, 82 percent
 of whom are Koreans, the benefits of equal access to public
 housing and loans, social security pensions for those who
 otherwise qualify, and certain public employment rights. The
 Foreign Ministry now pronounces Korean names according to the
 Korean rather than the Japanese reading of name characters.

 JAPAN
 Rectifying another issue of concern to resident Koreans, the
 Government recently announced it intends to revise the
 fingerprinting provisions of the Alien Registration Law,
 dropping the requirement that foreign residents be
 fingerprinted every 5 years and substituting a one-time only
 requirement. The Government also has extended until 1987 a
 Special Measures Law (first issued in 1969) designed to help
 assimilate Burakumin into mainstream society through a number
 of social, economic, and legal programs.
 According to law, aliens with 5 years' continuous residence
 are eligible for naturalization and the simultaneous
 acquisition of citizenship rights, including the right to
 vote. In fact, however, relatively few eligible aliens have
 been naturalized. Naturalization is a difficult and
 complicated process requiring "proof of assimilation into the
 Japanese culture," and many Korean residents are unwilling to
 seek naturalization on the grounds that their cultural
 identity would be erased by the requirements. Korean human
 rights activists have urged Japan to restore unconditionally
 the citizenship which Korean residents of Japan had previously
 but which was revoked after World War II.
 CONDITIONS OF LABOR
 The Labor Standards Law of 1947 provides for an 8-hour day, a
 48-hour week, and an overtime rate of time and a quarter.
 Workers under the age of 18 may not be employed in dangerous
 or harmful work, and minors under 15 years of age may not be
 employed as workers. A system fixing minimum wages on
 industry and regional bases was introduced by the Minimum
 Wages Law of 1959. The Ministry of Labor administers various
 laws and regulations governing occupational health and safety,
 principal among which is the Industrial Safety and Health Law
 of 1972.
