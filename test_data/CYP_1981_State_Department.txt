 CYPRUS
 Human rights issues in Cyprus reflect a long history of
 troubles between the Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot
 communities. Controversies have sprung from allegations by
 members of one community that they have suffered at the hands
 of the other, or the representatives of the other. Broadly
 speaking, the dispute over human rights in Cyprus stems first
 from the differences in interpretations of each community as to
 the causes of the Cyprus problem and the intercommunal troubles
 of 1963-74, as well as the differing prescriptions advanced by
 each side for a solution.
 The Greek Cypriots maintain that the Turkish intervention of
 1974 and the subsequent stationing of Turkish troops in the
 northern part of the island was the cause of a massive
 violation of human rights that continues to this day. They
 maintain that the forced expulsion of up to 180,000 Greek
 Cypriots from their homes and their subsequent status as
 displaced persons was and remains a clear violation of the
 right to live where one chooses. The continuing refusal of the
 Turkish Cypriot authorities to allow the return of the
 displaced persons, or to permit Greek Cypriots to travel within
 territory under Turkish Cypriot control is, in the Greek
 Cypriot view, inconsistent with basic human rights.
 The Turkish Cypriots maintain that the landing of Turkish
 troops in 1974 was legal and was justified by Greek-inspired
 moves to effect the island's annexation (enosis) to Greece.
 The intervention, according to the Turkish Cypriots, restored
 basic freedoms to the Turkish Cypriot community that had been
 usurped since 1963 by the Greek Cypriot authorities, who had
 conducted unrelenting physical, psychological and economic
 pressure on the Turkish Cypriot community to force the Turkish
 Cypriots to abandon the island. The Turkish Cypriots also
 insist that their rights be protected through the establishment
 of a federal republic in which they have equal representation
 with the Greek Cypriots, where most powers revert to the
 constituent states, and where freedom of movement will continue
 to be restricted. These proposals have been rejected by the
 Greek Cypriots, who insist on their rights as the majority
 community, and who maintain that freedom to reside, travel, and
 own property cannot be sacrificed in any acceptable settlement.
 I. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from%
 a. Torture
 Article I of the constitution prohibits torture. There have
 been no reports that torture is permitted or practiced by the
 Cyprus government, the Turkish Cypriot administration, or the
 Turkish forces in northern Cyprus.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 Freedom from cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or
 punishment is guaranteed by law in both communities, and has
 been respected in practice within each community during the
 past year. There have been no reports of summary executions.
 Adequate health care is provided in prison and detention

 facilities. Diet is considered normal. In detention, family
 members may visit at any interval that is not deemed as
 impeding an investigation.. Once sentenced, prisoners may be
 visited by family members once a month, or more frequently
 where humanitarian needs exist. Attorneys may visit prisoners
 freely. Differing classes of imprisonment do not exist except
 in cases requiring medical treatment and for first offenders
 awaiting trial.
 c. Disappearances
 There are no recent reports of persons being abducted, secretly
 arrested, or held in clandestine detention. However, as a
 result of the 1963-74 intercommunal troubles and the events of
 1974, the issue of missing persons remains a source of dispute
 between the Greek and Turkish Cypriot communities.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 Freedom from arbitrary arrest or imprisonment is guaranteed by
 law and respected in practice by both Greek and Turkish Cypriot
 authorities. The right of. habeas corpus is observed.
 Preventive detention does not exit in law, nor has it been
 reported in practice. No individual may be held for more than
 three days for investigation of a crime without referral to a
 court for extension of the period of detention. Most periods
 of investigative detention do not exceed eight or ten days
 before formal charges are filed.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 In both communities, fair public trial is guaranteed by law and
 provided in practice. Cyprus, a former British colony,
 incorporated many features of the British judicial system. The
 judiciary is independent of executive or military control.
 Jury trials are almost unknown and, although a request for a
 jury trial is usually granted, cases generally are tried before
 a judge or a panel of judges. All defendants are entitled to
 counsel and counsel has unrestricted, private access to his
 client. There-are no known incidents of harassment of defense
 lawyers. There are no special courts to deal with security or
 political offenses. There are no reports of political
 prisoners. Civilians are not tried by military courts.
 f. Invasion of the Home
 Inviolability of the home is guaranteed by the Cyprus
 constitution. The basic document governing the Turkish Cypriot
 community has a similar guarantee. It is respected in
 practice. A judicial warrant is required for an official to
 enter a private residence.
 2. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 All of these basic rights are guaranteed by law and are widely
 and freely practiced. The press is free throughout the entire
 island. There are 34 daily and weekly periodicals that run the
 breadth of the political spectrum. The government is
 frequently criticized. There is no press censorship, and no
 known incidents of intimidation of journalists. However, on
 one occasion in 1981, Turkish Cypriot authorities banned a
 Turkish film because it was deemed insulting to Turkey.
 Freedom of religion is guaranteed in both communities.

 b. Freedom of Movement within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration and Repatriation
 Turkish and Greek Cypriots enjoy freedom of movement within
 their respective areas. Some Turkish Cypriot villages adjacent
 to the cease-fire line, however, are under military control and
 closed to civilians.
 Travel between the two sectors is severely limited. Turkish
 Cypriot authorities, citing security reasons, generally forbid
 individuals of Greek ancestry and Greek Cypriots from entering
 the area under Turkish/Turkish Cypriot control, and Turkish
 Cypriots from travelling to the area under government of Cyprus
 control. Greek Cypriots still residing in the north (about
 1200), as well as members of the Maronite minority, are
 permitted to travel to the government-controlled area. Some
 limited travel is also allowed for humanitarian reasons, such
 as for Turkish Cypriots requiring emergency medical treatment
 in the south not available in the north.
 The government also restricts freedom of movement of visitors
 to and from the north. Foreigners arriving in ports under
 Turkish Cypriot control are denied entry to the
 government-controlled area because the government has declared
 the use of such ports illegal. In order to prevent visitors
 from using hotels that were taken over from Greek Cypriot
 owners in 1974, the government also usually refuses to allow
 foreign tourists to visit Turkish Cypriot-controlled areas for
 overnight or longer stays. Turkish Cypriot authorities, as a
 retaliatory measure, normally refuse entry to foreigners
 arriving from the south who will not be staying overnight.
 Visitors who are admitted must usually wait 48 hours for
 permission to enter.
 The right of travel abroad to emigrate is observed. However,
 some restrictions on exit permits exist for individuals facing
 military service or legal action. In the Greek Cypriot
 government-controlled area, because of labor shortages, some
 restrictions are also exercised over individuals seeking
 employment abroad. The right of Turkish Cypriots to travel
 abroad is complicated by the fact that most nations do not
 recognize travel documents issued by the "Turkish Federated
 State of Cyprus (TFSC)" or Cyprus passports issued before July
 15, 1974, if they have expired and had their validity extended
 by the "TFSC". Individuals may also repatriate freely,
 although both Greek and Turkish Cypriots may face military
 service if they have lived abroad and not fulfilled their
 military obligations.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Both the government of Cyprus and the Turkish Cypriot
 administration have lively and free, Western-style, multi-
 party political systems. There is active and unrestricted
 competition for support by political parties among all elements
 of society. Greek Cypriotsand Maronites living in the north
 do not participate in Turkish Cypriot elections, but do-elect
 their own village officials. In both north and south, women
 are less active in politics than men, although there is no
 legal impediment to their participation. There are some women
 in party structures and some women are represented at various
 sub-ministerial levels of government. For the first time, a
 female member of parliament was elected in the 1981 Greek
 Cypriot elections. The government of Cyprus has established an
 interministerial committee on the status of women. Both the
 
 
 748
 government and the Turkish Cypriot administration sent a
 representative to the World Conference for Women in
 Copenhagen. Both Greek and Turkish. Cypriots have an active
 trade union movement which exercises the right to organize,
 strike, and bargain collectively.
 3. Governmental Attitude and Record Regarding International
 and Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The question of missing persons--resulting from the
 intercommunal troubles from 1963-74 and the events of
 1974--remains a sore point. After four years of discussion, a
 committee on missing persons began holding meetings in July
 1981. However, the committee--which includes one member from
 each community and a representative from the International
 Committee of the Red Cross--has found considerable difficulty
 in coming to an agreement over its terms of reference. Greek
 Cypriots insist that the committee be empowered to conduct its
 own investigations anywhere on the island. Turkish Cypriots,
 who claim that all missing persons in fact perished during the
 1974 or earlier hostilities, insist that each side should
 conduct the investigations in their respective areas. The UN
 Human Rights Commission, meeting in Geneva in March 1981,
 postponed discussion of human rights issues in Cyprus until its
 following session. The commission's working group on
 disappeared persons reported briefly on its efforts to look
 into the question of possible enforced or involuntary
 disappearances on Cyprus. The group has been invited by the
 government of Cyprus to visit the country.
 4. Economic and Social Circumstances
 Per capita GNP in Cyprus was about $3,110 in 1979. The Greek
 Cypriot economy is free enterprise-oriented, with only a
 modicum of government participation or regulation. The economy
 is based on agriculture, trade, tourism, and manufacturing,
 with the latter sector the greatest contributor to GNP. The
 Turkish Cypriot economy is closely linked to that of Turkey,
 and is a mix of state-owned and private enterprises. It
 suffers from problems similar to those in Turkey, including
 high inflation, low investment, and significant underemployment.
 In both communities food, shelter, health care, and education
 are available to all regardless of race, religion, ethnic
 background, or political opinion. In both the Greek and
 Turkish Cypriot communities, society is essentially middle
 class, with a small, but prominent, wealthy class. Adequate
 housing is available, even for most displaced persons. A
 national health benefits scheme provides free medical care to
 lower income people and employees of the government of Cyprus.
 A similar measure provides for the needs of employees of the
 Turkish Cypriot authorities. Illiteracy is virtually unknown
 among the population under 55. Life expectancy at birth stood
 at 73 in 19.79, while infant mortality was 17.5 per 1000 live
 births. The population growth rate for the past decade has
 averaged 0.3 percent. Some 84 percent of the children of
 primary school age attended school.
 In both combunities, the legal status of women is equal to that
 of men. As Cyprus is a Mediterranean society, custom, rather
 than law, has retarded the full participation of women in all
 aspects of public life. Politics, for instancejhas
 traditionally been a male preserve in both communities.
 However, changing attitudes and contact with the outside world
 have brought increased mobility to women, many of whom can be
 expected to reach the highest ranks in their professions.
