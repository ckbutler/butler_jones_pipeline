 IRAQ
 Political power in Iraq1 lies exclusively in a repressive one-party apparatus domi-
 nated by Saddam Hussein and members of his extended family. The provisional
 Constitution of 1968 stipulates that the Arab Ba'ath Socialist Party (ABSP) governs
 Iraq through the Revolutionary Command Council (RCC), wich exercises bot exec-
 utive and legislative authority. Piesident Saddam Hussein, who is also Prime Min-
 istr, Chairman of the RCC, and Secretary General of the Regional Command of the
 ABSP, wields decisive power. Saddam Hussein and his regime continued to refer to
 an October 1995, nondemocratic "referendum" on his p residency in which he re-
 ceived 99.96 percent of the vote. Tis "referendum" included neither secret ballots
 nor opposing candidates, and many credible reports indicated that voters feared pos-
 sible reprisal for a negative vote.
 Ethnically and linguistically, the Iraqi population includes Arabs, Kurds,
 Turkomen, Assyrians, Yazidis, and Armenians. Historically, the religious mix is
 likewise varied: Shi'a and Sunni Muslims (both Arab and. Kurdish), Christians (in-
 cluding Chaldeans and Assyrians), and Jews (most of whom have emigrated). Ethnic
 divisions have resulted in civil uprisings in recent years, especially in the north and
 the south. The Government has reacted against those who revolt with extreme re-
 ression. The judiciary is not independent, and the President can override any court
 ecision.
 The Government's security apparatus includes militias attached to the President,
 the Ba'ath Party, and the Interior Ministry. The security forces play a central role
 in maintaining the environment of intimidation and fear on which government
 power rests. Security -orces committed widespread, serious, and systematic human
 rights abuses.
 The Government owns all major industries and controls most of the highly cen-
 tralized economy, which is based largely on oil production. The economy was dam-
 aged by the Gulf War, and Iraq has been subjected to United Nations sanctions
 since its 1990 invasion of Kuwait. As a result, the economy has been stagnant.
 Sanctions ban all exports, except for oil sales under U.N. Security Council Resolu-
 tion (UNSCR) 986, and allow imports only of food medicine, and other humani-
 tarian goods for essential civilian needs. The Government's failure to comply with
 U.N. Security Council resolutions has resulted in the maintenance of the sanctions.
 In December 1996, after a nearly a year and a half of obstruction and delay, the
 Government began to implement UNSCR 986. A significant part of the UNSCR 986
 1The United States does not have diplomatic representation in Iraq. This report draws to a
 large extent on non-U.S. Government sources.

 "oil for food" program was delayed during 1997 because the Government refused to
 pump oil for extended periods. The Government interfered with the international
 community's provision of humanitarian assistance to the Iraqi people routinely by
 placing a higher priority on importing industrial items than on food and medicine,
 diverting goods to benefit the regime, and restricting the work of U.N. personnel
 and relief workers. U.N. and European Union observers attribute the country's poor
 economic conditions to the Government's actions, not to the sanctions regime.
 Human rights abuse remained difficult to document because the Government's ef-
 forts to conceal the facts, including its persistent refusal to permit visits by human
 rights monitors and continued restrictions designed to prevent dissent. Max Van der
 Steel, the Special Rapporteur for Iraq of the U.N. Commission on Human Rights,
 based reports on interviews with recent emigres from Iraq and other sources, and
 opposition groups with contacts still in Iraq published reports.
 There was no improvement in the Government's extremely poor human rights
 record. Citizens do not have the right to change their government. The Government
 continued to summarily execute perceived political opponents, and reports of such
 summary executions increased significantly during the year. More than 2,000
 killings were reported. Several dozen of these reported executions followed specific
 allegations of coup attempts in February and August. However, reports suggest that
 far more people were executed merely because of their association with an opposi-
 tion group or in an effort to clear out of the prisons anyone with a sentence of 15
 to 20 years or more. The Government continued to kill and torture persons accused
 of economic crimes, military desertion, and a variety of other charges. Prison condi-
 tions are poor. The authorities routinely used arbitrary arrest and detention. The
 judiciary is not independent, and the President can override any court decision, and
 the Government continues to deny citizens the right to due process. The Govern-
 ment continues to deny citizens the right to privacy. The Government made use of
 civilians, including small children, as "human shields." The U.N. Special Rapporteur
 for Iraq confirmed in his November report that freedom of speech, the press, assem-
 bly, and association do not exist, except in some parts of the north under the control
 of Kurdish factions. The Government severely limits freedom of religion and move-
 ment, and discriminates against women, children, religious minorities, and ethnic
 groups. The Government also restricts worker rights.
 Iraqi military operations continued to target Shi'a Arabs living in the southern
 marshes. The Government maintained a partial internal embargo against Iraq's
 northern provinces, blocking shipments of food, medicine, and other goods, except
 those provided by the U.N. "oil-for-food" program.
 In northern Iraq, fighting continued between the two main Iraqi Kurdish groups,
 the Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) and the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK).
 In addition, attacks on civilians by the Turkish Kurd terrorist organization, the
 Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), resulted in many deaths, particularly among the
 vulnerable Assyrian minority and villagers who supported the KDP. Turkish forces
 entered Iraq several times during the ear to combat the PKK. These separate con-
 flicts converged in November, w en    rkish air and ground elements joined the
 KDP to force the PUK and 'the PKK to return to the established intra-Kurdish
 ceasefire line. The fighting left over a thousand persons dead and forced thousands
 of civilians from their homes. A ceasefire established on November 24 ended the
 fighting for the remainder of the year, albeit with a few sporadic clashes.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-The Government has a long record
 of executing perceived opponents. The U.N. Special Rapporteur, the international
 media, and other groups all reported an increased number of extrajudicial killings
 during the year. The Special Rapporteur has stated that "the country is run through
 extrajudicial measures," In a 1996 report, Amnesty International (AI) noted that
 various decrees expanding the use of the death penalty in 1994 and 1995 have not
 been sufficiently clarified to ensure fair and just applicability, a problem
 compounded by the lack of an independent judiciary. The list of offenses requiring
 a mandatory death penalty has grown substantially in recent years, and now in-
 cludes forgery, smuggling cars, and "sabotaging the national economy." The Special
 Rapporteur noted that membership in certain political parties is punishable by
 death, that there is a pervasive fear of death for any act or expression of dissent,
 and that there are recurrent reports of the use of the death penalty for such offenses
 as "insulting" the President or the Ba'ath Party. These killings occur with total im-
 punity and without due process.
 
 
 1451
 The Baghdad regime periodically eliminated large numbers of political detainees
 en masse. In February and March, some 200 to 650 persons were said to have been
 executed in Abu Ghuraib prison, near Baghdad. The Special Rapporteur related in
 detail allegations that filtered out of Iraq about the killings. According to these re-
 p orts, by order of Qusay Hussein, one of Saddam Hussein's sons and chief of Special
 Security, a 'judges committee" drew up a timetable for killing all detainees sen-
 tenced to death. Executions were carried out on Sundays and Wednesdays.
 There were many other credible reports of mass executions; on August 31, ap-
 proximately 170 persons arrested by the Government during its brief 1996 occupa-
 tion of Irbil were executed on the one-year anniversary of the Iraqi attack on that
 city; in September 600 prisoners were killed in Abu Ghuraib; on November 9, ap-
 proximately 100 persons were executed at an undisclosed site; on November 12, 568
 people were executed at Abu Ghuraib; on November 15, approximately 80 Iraqi offi-
 cers and Iranian prisoners of. war (POW's) were executed at the Mosul prison.
 The total -number killed at Abu Ghuraib prison and the Radwaniyah detention
 center in late November and early December may have reached 800 to 1,500 per-
 sons. Opposition groups alleged that all political prisoners with sentences of more
 than 15 to 20 years were summarily executed. Qusay Hussein again was named as
 instrumental in this program of executions, allegedly ordering. that the prisons be
 "cleaned out."
 As in previous years, there also were numerous credible reports that the regime
 executed persons allegedly involved in plotting against Saddam or the Ba'ath party,
 including high-ranking civilian,. military, and tribal leaders. In February, eleven
 members of the A-Nadha movement were killed by the Special Security forces.
 Fourteen intelligence and special forces officers were executed in September, alleg-
 edly for plotting to assassinate Saddam Hussein. Also in September, 10 members
 of the Bani-Hi-jaym tribe were executed after they attacked the Ba'ath party head-
 quarters in A-Samawah. On -November 12, six or seven- Wahabis (memlers of the
 conservative Sunni Islamic sect centered in Saudi Arabia) were executed at al-Anbar
 in the, Rumadi area. Also on November 12, 11 people who allegedly attacked a
 Ba'athist political office were executed at Dakuk.
 Economic crimes may also be punishable by death. For example, on December 7,
 two Iranian Kurdish refugees attem tin     to smuggle fuel from    Kirkuk to
 Suleymaniyah province were arrested by Iraqi security forces at Chamchamal.
 While in custody-in the presence of the chief of eastern sector military security-
 they allegedly were killed by being doused with gasoline and set on fire. On Decem-
 ber 8, four Jordanian students who allegedly had smuggled about $850 worth of
 spare auto-parts from Jordan to Iraq were-executed. On December 13, a group of
 officers and men of the 4th corps were executed on charges of smuggling weapons
 into Iraqi Kurdistan.
 Reports of deaths due to poor conditions in prisons and detention facilities also
 increased during the year. According to the U.N. Special Rapporteur, many pris-
 oners in Amarah province were reported as near death because of lack of adequate
 food and health care. Ten refugees returning from Saudi Arabia in May allegedly
 were poisoned while in jail in Baghdad. All of them reportedly died after their re-
 lease in June, after suffering from paralysis and severe bleeding. In November the
 opposition Iraqi National Congress alleged that the regime had plotted to murder
 U.N. Special Commission (UNSCOM) executive commissioner Rolf Ekeus by poison-
 ing him with thallium. Sixty Iranian Kurds at the- Bazan refugee camp near
 Suleymaniyah reported that they had been poisoned with thallium in their drinking
 water, however, they. attributed the poisoning to Iranian agents.
 There are persistent reports that, even as he recovers, from wounds suffered in
 a 1996 assassination attempt, Uday Hussein, Saddam Hussein's eldest son, has re-
 mained.active in extrajudicial killings. In a July incident, heallegedly killed one of
 his bodyguards, for reasons that remain unclear.
 Indications persist that the -Government has offered "bounties" to anyone who
 kills United Nations or other international relief workers in northern Iraq. The Gov-
 ernment has-repeatedly charged that foreign relief organizations working in north-
 ern Iraq are engaged in espionage, making their employees liable to the death pen-
 alt in previous years, the regime continued to deny totally the widespread killings
 of Kurds in northern Iraq during the "Anfal" Campaign of 1988 (see Sections 1.b.
 and 1.g.). Both the Special.Rapporteur and Human Rights Watch have concluded
 that the Government's policies against the Kurds raise issues of crimes against hu-
 manity and violations of the 1948 Genocide Convention.
 Political killings and terrorist actions continued in northern Iraq. Throughout the
 year elements of the PKK remained active in northern Iraq, reportedly killing local
 residents in an effort to control a territorial base. Assyrian groups reported several
 
 
 1452
 instances of mob violence by Muslims against Christians in the north, allegedly re-
 sulting in several deaths. Intra-Kurdish fighting in October and November resulted
 in the deaths of over 1200 fighters and an undisclosed number of civilians. On De-
 cember 8, five members of an Iranian Kurdish group were killed in PUK-held terri-
 tory.
 b. Disappearance.-During the year, the Special Rapporteur continued to receive
 reports of widespread disappearances. The Government continued to ignore the
 more than 15,000 cases conveyed to it in 1994 and 1995 by the U.N. Working Group
 on Enforcement on Involuntary Disappearances, as well as requests from the Gov-
 ernments of Kuwait and Saudi Arabia on the whereabouts of those missing from the
 1990-1991 occupation of Kuwait and from Iran on the whereabouts of POW's Iraq
 captured in the 1980-1988 Iran-Iraq war.
 The United Nations has documented over 16,000 cases of persons who had dis-
 appeared. According to the Special Rapporteur, most of these cases occurred during
 the Anfal Campaign. He estimates that the total number of Kurds who disappeared
 during Anfal could reach the tens of thousands. Human Rights Watch estimates
 that the total at between 70,000 and 150,000, and Amnesty International (AD at
 more than 100,000. Many individuals who disappeared in the wake of the 1996 Gov-
 ernment attack on Irbil may have been killed late in the year, in the alleged govern-
 ment campaign to "cleanse the prisons" (see Section L.a.).
 In an October report, Amnesty International documented the repeated failure of
 the Government to respond to requests for information about persons who had dis-
 appeared. The report details unresolved cases dating from the early 1980's through
 the mid-1990's, particularly the disappearances of Aziz al-Sayyid Jassem, Sayyid
 Muhammad Sadeq Muhammad Ri a al-Qazwini, Mazin Abd al-Munim al-
 Samarrai, the six al-Hashimi brothers, the four al-Sheibani brothers, and numerous
 persons of Iranian descent or Shi'a religious belief. The report concludes that few
 of these victims became targets of the regime for anything they had allegedly done.
 Rather, they were arrested as "hostages" in order to force a relative who may have
 escaped abroad to surrender, because of their family link to a political opponent, or
 simply for their ethmc origin.
 In other cases, individuals arrested or taken prisoner in specific circumstances
 have disappeared while in government custody. For example, the status of six mem-
 bers of the Assyrian community of Baghdad, arrested in October 1996, is unknown.
 Hundreds are still missing in the aftermath of the brief Iraqi military occupation
 of Irbil in August 1996. Many of these persons may' have been killed surreptitiously
 late in 1997, m the reported regime campaign to cleanse the prisons" (see Section
 L.a.). Thirty-three members of the Yazich community of Mosul, who were arrested
 in July 1996, are still unaccounted for.
 The Special Rapporteur and several human rights groups continued to request
 that the Government provide information about the arrest in 1991 of the late Grand
 Ayatollah Abdul Qasim A1-Khoei and 108 of his associates. The Ayatollah died while
 under house arrest in Al-Najaf. Others arrested with him have not been accounted
 for, and the Government refuses to respond to queries regarding their status.
 The Government failed to return, or account for, a large number of Kuwaiti citi-
 zens and citizens of other countries detained during the Iraqi occupation of Kuwait.
 Government officials, including military leaders known to have been among the last
 to see the disappeared during the occupation, have refused to respond to the hun-
 dreds of outstanding inquiries about the missing. Of 609 cases of missing Kuwaiti
 citizens under review by the Quadrilateral Commission on Gulf War Missing, only
 two have been resolved. The Iraqi Government denies having any knowledge of the
 others and claims that any relevant records were lost in the aftermath of the Gulf
 War.
 Iran reports that 5,000 Iranian POWs from the Iran-Iraq War (1981-88) are unac-
 counted for by Iraq. On November 26, Iran unilaterally released 500 Iraqi POWs
 from that war. Possibly in response, on December 4, Iraq released two Iranians who
 had been arrested in Iraq in 1991.
 In May an Iraqi engineer seeking refuge in Western Europe reported that many
 Iraqi chemical and biological warfare workers had disappeared or died under mys-
 terious circumstances, some after contracting unknown diseases.
 In addition to the tens of thousands of reported disappearances, human rights
 gups reported in 1997 that the Government continued to hold thousands of other
 Iraq is in incommunicado detention (see Section 1.d.).
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution prohibits torture, however, the security services routinely tortured
 detainees. According to former detainees, torture techniques included branding, elec-
 tric shocks administered to the genitals and other areas, beating, burning with hot
 irons, suspension from rotating ceiling fans, dripping acid on the skin, rape, break-
 
 
 1453
 ing of limbs, denial of food and water, and threats to rape or otherwise harm rel-
 atives. The security forces killed many of their torture victims and mutilated their
 bodies before returning them to the victims' families. There are persistent reports
 that the families are~made to pay for the costs of the execution, before the bodies
 are returned to them. Iraqi refugees arriving in Europe often reported instances of
 torture to the receiving governments and-as was the case with a group of refugees
 -arriving in Italy in June-displayed scars and mutilations to substantiate their
 claims. Amnesty International notes that Iraqi authorities have failed to investigate
 these reports. There were no reports of amputations or brandings during the year.
 The Special Rapporteur, human rights organizations, and opposition groups con-
 tinued to receive numerous reports of women suffering severe psychological trauma
 after they were raped while in-custody. The security forces allegedly raped women
 captured during the Anfal Campaign and during the occupation of Kuwait. The Gov-
 ernment has never acknowledged these reports of rape or conducted any investiga-
 tion. Although the Government made a variety of pronouncements against rape and
 other violent crimes during the year, it took no action against those who committed
 this abuse.
 - Prison conditions are poor. Certain prisons are notorious for routine mistreatment
 of prisoners. Abu Ghuraib prison west of Baghdad may hold as many as 15,000 per-
 sons, many of whom are reportedly subjected to torture. Al-Rashidiya prison, on the
 Tigris River north of Taji, reportedly .has borture chambers. The Al-Shamma'iya
 rison, located in east Baghdad, holds the mentally. ill and is reportedly the site of
 bth torture and -disappearances. The Radwaniyah detentiorr center is a former pris-
 oner-of-war facility near Baghdad and reportedly the site of torture as well as mass
 executions. This prison was the, principal- detention center for persons arrested fol-
 lowing the civil uprisings of 1991. Human Rights Watch and others have estimated
 that Radwaniyah holds' more than 5,000 detainees; Iraqi opposition groups say it
 is, located within a "presidential" compound, from which the regime precludes in-
 spections by the U.N. Special Commission charged with eliminated Iraqi weapons
 of mass destruction. Radwaniyah is where Uday Hussein is alleged to have had the
 Iraqi national soccer team caned on the soles of their feet after a World Cup qualify-
 ing loss to Khazakstan, a charge being investigated by the International Football
 Association (FIFA).
 There were no details on.the condition of prisoners in northern Iraq.
 The Government does not permit prison visits by human rights monitors.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Although the Constitution and the Legal
 Code explicitly prohibit arbitrary arrest and detention, the authorities routinely en-
 gaged in these practices. The Special Rapporteur stated that arbitrary arrests are
 still common throughout the country, and many times lead to detention for often
 long periods of time without access to a lawyer or being.brought before a court.
 The military and security services, rather than the ordinary police, carried out
 most cases of arbitrary arrest and detention. During the year, security forces report-
 edly arrested hundreds of persons perceived as security threats, mainly on the basis
 of an individual's personal association or family connection with opponents of the
 Government. On Jul 15, in Baghdad dozens of Shi'a youths were reported to have
 been arrested and geld incommunicado, and 84 merchants were arrested in an
 "anti-fraud" sweep in February. Sometimes, those arrested were reportedly killed
 while in custody (see Section l.a.).
 According to international human rights groups, numerous foreigners arrested ar-
 bitrarily in previous years remain in detention.
 It has also been reported that there is a widespread practice of holding family
 members and close associates responsible for the alleged actions of others. The Spe-
 cial Rapporteur notes that "guilt by association" is facilitated by administrative re-
 quirements on relatives of deserters or other perceived opponents of the regime. For
 example, relatives who did not report deserters could lose their ration cards for pur-
 chasing government-controlled food supplies or be evicted from their residences. .
 Amnesty International reported in October that relatives often do not inquire about
 the whereabouts of arrested family members for fear of being arrested themselves.
 Mass arrests are also reportedly commonplace; the Special Rapporteur learned of
 at least 3 such instances in southern Iraq in 1997. Twenty-five families are reported
 to have been interred in Al-FaJir prison in Nassariyah province; 30 persons (women,
 children, and old men) from AI-Ghizlah reportedly were arrested and taken to Bagh-
 dad; on April 3, a large number of persons reportedly were arrested in the Bani Said
 area and have yet to be released.
 The Government reportedly continued to target Shi'a Muslim clergy and their
 supporters for arbitrary arrest and other abuses. It also reportedly continued forc-
 ibly to move Shi'a populations from the south to the north, and other minority
 
 
 1454
 groups such as Assyrians and Turkomen from the north to government-controlled
 territory.
 There was no substantive evidence that the Government was implementing two
 "amnesty" decrees issued in 1995. Human rights monitors remain concerned that
 Iraqi authorities may be attempting to bring deserters and government opponents
 out of hiding in order to penalize them.
 Although no statistics are available, observers estimate the number of political de-
 tainees in the tens of thousands. .
 The Government is not known to practice forced exile. However, 1 to 2 million
 self-exiled Iraqis are fearful of returning to Iraq.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The judiciary is not independent, and there is no
 check on the President's power to override any court decision. The Special
 Rapporteur and international human rights groups all observed during the year
 that the repressive nature of the political and legal systems precludes any concept
 of rule of law. Numerous laws lend themselves to continued repression, and the
 Government uses extrajudicial methods to extract confessions or coerce cooperation
 with the regime.
 There are two parallel judicial systems: the regular courts, which try common
 criminal offenses; and special security courts, which generally try national security
 cases, but may also try criminal cases. There is a Court of Appeal and the Court
 of Cassation, which is the highest court.
 Procedures in the regular courts theoretically provide for many protections. How-
 ever, the regime often assigns to the security courts cases which, on their merits,
 would appear to fall under the jurisdiction of the regular courts. Trials in the regu-
 lar courts are public, and defendants are entitled to counsel, at government expense
 in the case of indigents. Defense lawyers have the right to review the charges and
 evidence brought against their clients. There is no jury system; panels of three
 judges try cases. Defendants have the right to appeal to the Court of Appeal and
 then to the Court of Cassation.
 The Government shields certain groups from prosecution for alleged crimes. A
 1992 decree grants immunity from prosecution to members of the Ba'ath Party and
 the security forces who kill anyone while in pursuit of army deserters. Unconfirmed
 but widespread reports indicate that this decree was applied in 1997 to prevent
 trials or punishment of government officials. Nevertheless, Saddam Hussein's per-
 sonal decree clearly supersedes any legal proceedings-including those designed to
 shield his family. For example, in May the President reportedly seized the assets
 of his half brother Sabawi Ibrahim A1-Hassan. A 1990 decree grants immunity to
 men who commit "honor crimes," i.e., kill their female family members for a per-
 ceived lack of chastity.
 Special security courts have jurisdiction in all cases involving espionage and trea-
 son, peaceful political dissent, smuggling, currency exchange violations, and drug
 trafficking. According to the Special Rapporteur and other sources, military officers
 or civil servants with no legal training head these tribunals, which hear cases in
 secret. Authorities often hold defendants incommunicado and do not permit contact
 with lawyers. The courts admit confessions extracted by torture, which often serve
 as the basis for conviction. There are reports that individuals who have cooperated
 with U.N. weapons inspectors have been subjected to secret trials.
 Many cases appear to end in summary execution, although defendants may ap-
 peal to the President for clemency. Saddam Hussein may grant clemency in any
 case that apparently suits his political goals. There are no Shari'a, or Islamic law,
 courts as such. Regular courts are empowered to administer Islamic law in cases
 involving personal status, such as divorce and inheritance.  .
 Because the Government rarely acknowledges arrests or imprisonments and fami-
 lies are afraid to talk about arrests, it is difficult to estimate the number of political
 pisoners. Many of the tens of thousands of persons who have disappeared or been
 killed in recent years were originally held as political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Government frequently disregarded the constitutional right to privacy, particularly
 in cases allegedly involving national security. The law defines security offenses so
 broadly that authorities are virtually exempt from the legal requirement to obtain
 search warrants. The authorities frequently conduct searches, without warrants. The
 regime routinely ignored constitutional provisions safeguarding the confidentiality of
 mail, telegraphic correspondence, and telephone conversations. The Government pe-
 riodically jammed news broadcasts, including those of opposition groups, from out-
 sid Kkuk the regime periodically sealed off whole districts and conducted day-
 long, house to house searches, evidently as part of its campaign to harass and expel
 ethnic Kurds and Turkomen from the city (see Section 2.d.).
 
 
 1455
 
 The security services and the Ba'ath Party maintain pervasive networks of in-
 formers to deter dissident activity and instill fear in the public. For example, the
 Special Rapporteur reported that an operator was arrested and executed in 1993 -for
 having warned a person not to use a wiretapped telephone line. The authorities also
 hold family members and close associates responsible for the alleged actions of oth-
 ers (see Section 1.d.).
 In September Iraqi expatriates in Amman reported a new government effort for
 surveillance of university students. Worried about antigovernment pamphlets that
 appeared at Basrah and Qadisiyah Universities in 1996, the regime used the Min-
 istry of Education to move undercover military intelligence and Special Security offi-
 cers onto campuses around the country.
 g. Use of Excessive Force and Violations of Humanitarian Law In Internal Con-
 flicts.-As in previous years, the armed forces conducted deliberate artillery attacks
 against Shi'a civilians in the southern marshes and against minority groups in
 northern Iraq. In 1992 the Gulf War allies imposed "no-fly zones" over both north-
 ern and southern Iraq. The no-fly zones continued to deter aerial attacks on the
 marsh dwellers in southern Iraq and residents of northern Iraq, but they did not
 prevent artillery attacks on villages in either area, nor the military's large-scale
 burning operations in the southern marshes.
 For example, in April heavy artillery attacks on the towns of Al-Ghizlan in
 Nasseriyah province and Al-Eliwa, Abu Ashra, Al-Adil, and Al-Salam in Amarah
 provinc reportedly resulted in substantial civilian casualties, including women and
 children. In May the same sort of attack occurred at Al-Tar and Al-Shiukh in
 Nasariyah province. On November 1, a week-long operation in the marshes con-
 ducted by the Third Corps was led off by similar heavy artillery assaults. Several
 civilians were reportedly wounded in another shelling incident in the Al Zoor area
 of Naseriyah province on November 18 and 19.
 During the year, Government also continued its water-diversion and other
 projects in the south, accelerating the process of large-scale environmental destruc-
 tion. The Government claimed that the drainage is part of a land reclamation plan
 to increase the acreage of arable land, spur agricultural production, and reduce salt
 pollution in the Tigris and Euphrates rivers. However, the evidence of large-scale
 human and ecological destruction appears to belie this claim, and other credible re-
 ports confirmed the ongoing destruction of the marshes. The Supreme Council of the
 Islamic Revolution in Iraq (SCIRI) claimed to have obtained government documents
 describing its long-range plans to drain the marshes completely. The army contin-
 ued to construct canals, causeways, and earthen berms to divert water from the wet-
 lands. Hundreds of square kilometers have been burned in military operations.
 Moreover, the regime's diversion of supplies in the south limited the population's ac-
 cess to food, medicine, drinking water, and transportation.
 According to the U.N. Special Rapporteur and opposition sources, thousands of
 persons in Nasseriyah and Basrah provinces were denied rations under UNSCR
 986. In these provinces and in Amarah province, access to food is allegedly used to
 reward regime supporters and silence opponents. Shi'a opposition groups report
 that, due to the continuing fighting, the condition of the Shi'a in the south has con-
 tinued to deteriorate even after the institution of the U.N."s "oil for food" program.
 The Government maintained a partial internal embargo against the three prov-
 inces in northern Iraq for most of the year. These provinces are populated primarily
 by Kurds, Assyrians, Turkomen, and other ethnic minorities. The embargo pre-
 vented the free movement of food, medicine, and other humanitarian supplies to
 that area. Beginning in 1993, the embargo also included the cutoff of electric power
 in specific areas, causing the disruption of water and sanitation systems, and inter-
 fering with the delivery of food and fuel. Indications of loosened restrictions for the
 territory controlled by the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan appeared to be tied to politi-
 cal concessions, such as accepting school textbooks praising Saddam Hussein and
 the Iraqi regime.
 A multinational coalition continued enforcement of a "no-fly zone" to inhibit gov-
 ernment aerial activity to repress citizens in northern Iraq. The Government contin-
 ued to Arabize certain areas, such as the urban centers of Kirkuk and Mosul,
 through the forced movement of local residents from their homes and villages and
 their replacement by Arabs from outside the area (see Section 1.d.).
 The PKK also committed numerous abuses against civilians in northern Iraq
 throughout the year. For example, on August 4, five persons were reportedly kid-
 naped from the village of Gunda Jour by a PKK band. Iraqi Kurds reported that
 on October 23, a PKK unit killed 14 civilians (10 of them children) and wounded
 9 others in attacks on the villages of Korka, Chema, Dizo, and Selki. On December
 13, seven Assyrian civilians reportedly were ambushed and killed near the village
 of Mangeesh. Many villagers in Dohuk and Irbil provinces, particularly those from

 isolated areas, were reported to have abandoned their homes and temporarily relo-
 cated to cities and lager towns to escape PKK attacks.
 On several occasions in 1997, Turkish armed forces entered northern Iraq in pur-
 suit of PKK terrorists and bases. In November Turkish and KDP forces fought
 pitched battles against the PUK and the PKK. These operations resulted in some
 civilian deaths and destruction of residences. The Government of Turkey denied al-
 legations that Turkish forces used air-delivered incendiary bombs and intentionally
 targeted civilian populations in their operations; independent observers on the scene
 found no evidence of such actions. Turkish government authorities stressed that the
 operations sought to avoid civilian casualties and that much of the fighting took
 place in unpopulated areas.
 Land mines in northern Iraq, mostly planted by the Government before 1991, con-
 tinued to kill and maim civilians. Many of the mines were laid during the Iran-Iraq
 War, but the army failed to clear them before it abandoned the area. The mines
 ap pear to have been haphazardly planted in civilian areas. Land mines are also a
 problem a alalong the Iraq-fran border throughout central and southern Iraq, but
 there is no information on civilian casualties or the efforts, if any, to clear old mine-
 fields in areas under the central Government's control. The Special Rapporteur re-
 peatedly has reminded the Government of its obligation under the Land Mines Pro-
 tocol to protect civilians from the effects of mines. Various nongovernmental organi-
 zations (NGO's) continued efforts to remove mines from the area and increase mine
 awareness among local residents.
 After the 1991 Gulf War, victims and eyewitnesses described war crimes per-
 petrated by the Iraqi regime-deliberate killing, torture, rape, pillage, hostage-tak-
 ing, and associated acts-directly related to the Gulf War. Many governments con-
 tinue to urge the U.N. Security Council to establish an international commission to
 study evidence of a broader range of war crimes, as well as crimes against humanity
 and possible genocide. Human Rights Watch (HRW) and other organizations have
 worked with various governments to bring a genocide case at the International
 Court of Justice against the Government for its conduct of the Anfal campaign
 against the Kurds in 1988.
 In September the Iranian Air Force attacked two camps of the Iranian terrorist
 group Mujahedin Al-Khalq (MEK) in Iraq. There were reports of casualties among
 Iraqi civilians.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech
 and of the press, but also stipulates that "the State ensures the considerations nec-
 essary to exercise these liberties, in compliance with the revolutionary, national and
 progressive trend." In practice, freedom of speech and of the press do not exist, and
 political dissent is not tolerated in areas under the Government's control. The Spe-
 cial Rapprur noted that "the people live in a climate of fear in which whatever
 they or their family members may say or do, particularly in the area of politics, in-
 volves the risk of arrest and interrogation by the police or military intelligence."
 The Government and the Ba'ath P arty own all print and broadcast media and op-
 erate them as propaganda outlets. They generally do not report opposing points of
 view that are expressed either domestically or abroad. According to the Special
 Rapporteur, journalists are under regular pressure to join the Ba'ath party and
 must follow the recommendations of the Iraqi Union of Journalists, headed by Uday
 Hussein. The Special Rapporteur reported that one journalist was sentenced to life
 imprisonment for telling a joke about Saddam Hussein, while another was arrested
 on charges of "collaboration with foreign countries," possibly a reference to a nega-
 tive report on the economic situation.
 The Special Rapporteur reported that the Ministry of Culture and Information pe-
 riodically holds meetings at which general guidelines for the press are provided.
 Foreign journalists must work from offices located within the ministry building and
 be accompanied everywhere they go by ministry officers, who reportedly restrict the
 reporters movements and make it impossible for them to interact freely with the
 populace. Since Western news services have not been permitted to establish perma-
 nent bureaus in Iraq, they are represented in Baghdad by Iraqi staffers who are
 based in the Ministry of Information and Culture.
 Several statutes and decrees suppress freedom of speech and the press. These in-
 dlude Revolutionary Command Council decree no. 840 of November 1986, which pe-
 nalizes free expression and stipulates the death penalty for anyone insulting the
 President or other high government officials; Section 214 of the Penal Code, which
 prohibits singing a song likely to cause civil strife; and the Press Act of 1968, which
 prohibits the writing of articles on 12 specific subjects, including those detrimental
 to the President, the Revolutionary Command Council, and the Ba'ath Party.
 
 
 1457
 Books can be published only with the authorization of the Ministry of Culture and
 Information. The Ministry of Education often sends textbooks with pro-regime prop-
 aganda to Kurdish regions; the Kurds routinely remove propaganda items from the
 books. In October the Minister of Education "warned these cliques that we hold
 them responsible" for altering the books.
 The Government regularly jammed foreign news broadcasts (see Section 1.f.). In
 an effort to interdict further any foreign reports on Iraq, the Government also
 banned satellite dishes. The penalty for possessing a satellite dish reportedly is an
 indefinite term of imprisonment in solitary confinement and confiscation of all
 household effects.
 In northern Iraq, several newspapers have appeared over the past 5 years, as
 have opposition radio and television broadcasts. The absence of central authority
 permits some freedom of expression, although most journalists are influenced or
 controlled by various political organizations.
 The Government has no respect for academic freedom, exercising strict control
 over academic publications. University staff is hired or fired depending on their sup-
 port for the Government.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 freedom of assembly, but, except in Kurdish-controlled northern areas, citizens may
 not assemble legally other than to express support for the regime. The Government
 regularly orchestrates crowds to demonstrate support for the regime and its policies
 through financial incentives for those who participate and threats of violence
 against those who do not.
 The Constitution provides for freedom of association, but the Government controls
 the establishment of political parties, regulates their internal affairs, and monitors
 their activities. Several parties are specifically outlawed, and membership in them
 is a capital offense. A 1974 law prescribes the death penalty for anyone "infitrating"
 the Ba ath Party.
 In Kurdish-controlled northern Iraq, the situation is mixed. For example, 120,000
 people reportedly participated in a protest march in Irbil in October, demanding
 that the PUK restore electrical power to the city.. On the other hand, both the KDP
 and the PUK intimidated, seized the property of, and forcibly expelled members and
 alleged supporters of the rival organization from the territory they control (see Sec-
 tion 2.d.).
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of religion, but
 also notes that "Islam is the religion of the State." In practice, the Government se-
 verely limits freedom of religion. The Ministry of Endowments and Religious Affairs
 monitors places of worship, appoints the clergy, and approves the publication of reli-
 gious literature.
 Although Shi'a Muslim Arabs, who compose between 60 and 65 percent of the
 population, are the largest religious group, Sunni Arabs (composing only about 12
 to 15 percent of the population) traditionally have dominated economic and political
 life. Despite legal protection of sectarian equality, the regime has in recent years
 repressed the Shi'a clergy and followers of the Shi'a faith. Security forces have dese-
 crated Shi'a mosques and holy sites, particularly in the aftermath of the 1991 civil
 uprisings.
 The following government restrictions on religious rights remained in effect
 throughout 1997: a ban on the Muslim call to prayer in certain cities; a ban on the
 broadcast of Shi'a programs on government radio or television; a ban on the publica-
 tion of Shi'a books, including prayer books; a ban on funeral processions; and the
 prohibition of certain processions and public meetings commemorating Shi'a holy
 days. In June serious clashes were reported between Shi'a pilgrims traveling to
 Karbala for the Arba'in commemoration and security forces and government-backed
 Sunni civilians. Reports of casualties varied widely, indicating that between 40 to
 500 pilgrims were killed. The Government cut off food, water, and electricity to the
 city of Karbala. Some pilgrims were allegedly kidnaped and their families were
 forced to pay a ransom to the Government to effect their release.
 The Government continues to insist that its own appointee replace the late Grand
 Ayatollh Abul Qasin Al-Khoei, formerly the highest ranking Iraqi Shi'a clergyman,
 ho diedingovement custody in 1992 (see Section 1.b.). The Shi'a religious estab-
 lishment refuses to accept the Government's choice. The Government also continued
 to harass and threaten members of the late Ayatollah A1-Khoei's family (see Sec-
 tions 1.a. and 1b.). In Najaf on November 25, government agents allegedly attacked
 the house of Mohammed Rida Sistani, the son of Ayatollah Syed Ali Sistani, one
 of the most senior Shi'a leaders in Iraq. Sistani was wounded, a colleague was
 killed, and Sistani's home was ransacked, according to a SCIRI report.
 
 
 1458
 
 As far as is known, the security forces still were encamped in the shrine to Imam
 Ali at Al-Najaf, one of Shi'a Islam's holiest sites, and the former Shi'a theological
 school in AI-Najaf.
 The Special Rapporteur and others reported that the Government has engaged in
 various abuses against the country's 350,000 Assyrian Christians. Most Assyrians
 traditionally live in the northern governorates, and the Government often has sus-
 pected them of "collaborating" with Kurds. Military forces destroyed numerous As-
 syrian churches during the Aal Campaign and reportedly tortured and executed
 many Assyians (see Section 4). According to Human Rights Watch and Assyrian
 sources, the Government ontinues to harass and kill Assyrans throughout the
 country by forced relocations, terror, and artillery shelling.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Government controls the movement within the country of citizens
 and foreigners. Persons who enter sensitive border areas and numerous designated
 security zones are subject to arrest. Police checkpoints are common on major roads
 and highways.
 In Novembr, at the height of the Government's defiance of U.N. resolutions re-
 quiring inspections for weapons of mass destruction, the Government announced
 that hundreds of patriotic citizens had volunteered to serve as "human shields" in
 the event of a coalition air strike on Saddam Hussein's palaces and military-indus-
 trial sites. However, reports from opposition sources in Iraq claimed that Ba'ath
 Party functionaries had been issued quotas of "volunteers" to recruit to serve in this
 capacity. When bribes of increased food rations failed to generate the required num-
 ber of persons, the Ba'ath Party, in conjunction with the security services, report-
 edly coerced civilians to serve as "human shields."
 The Government requires citizens to obtain specific government authorization and
 expensive exit visas for foreign travel. Citizens may not make more than two trips
 abroad annually. Before traveling abroad, citizens are required to post collateral
 with the Government, which is refundable only upon their return to Iraq. There are
 restrictions on the amount of currency that may be taken out of the country. Women
 are not permitted to travel outside Iraq alone; male relatives must escort them.
 Each student wishing to travel abroad must provide a guarantor who is liable if the
 student fails to return. Students abroad who refuse to return to Iraq are required
 to reimburse any of their expenses that were paid by the Government.
 The Government prohibits foreign travel by journalists, authors, and all the em-
 ployees of the Information Ministry. Security authorities interrogate all media em-
 ployees, journalists, and writers who travel outside Iraq.
 Foreign spouses of citizens who have resided in Iraq for 5 year, (1 year for
 spouses of government employees) are required to apply for naturalization as Iraqi
 citizens. Many foreigners thus become subject to travel restrictions. The penalties
 for noncompliance include, but are not limited to, loss of the spouse's job, a substan-
 tial financial penalty, and repayment for any governmental educational expenses.
 The Government prevents many citizens who also hold citizenship in another coun-
 try-especially the children of Iraqi fathers and foreign-born mothers-from visitihg
 the country of their other nationality.
 The Government continued to pursue its discriminatory resettlement policies, in-
 cluding demolition of villages and forced relocation of ethnic Kurds, Turkomen, As-
 syrians, and other minorities. Human rights monitors reported that the Government
 continued to force Kurdish and Turkomen residents of Kirkuk to move to other
 areas in the north or to the south. In their place, ethnic Arab families were moved
 in, evidently in an effort to "Arabize" this oil-rich city. Another motive may have
 been simple theft; the Special Rapporteur described the alleged expropriation of
 Turkomen agricultural land near Kirkuk by high-level regime officials and members
 of Saddam Hussein's family. Typically the displaced persons reported that they were
 given at most 1 week to leave, and that they often were not allowed to bring their
 belongings with them. In many cases, Iraqi security officials reportedly seized food
 coupons issued to displaced persons under the U.N. "oil-for-food" program. Amnesty
 International reported that, according to some sources, family members, including
 children, are sometimes taken hostage by the Government to ensure that families
 do not resist the order to move.
 The U.N. Secretary General estimates that there are more than half a million in-
 ternally displaced persons in the three northern provinces (Irbil, Dohuk, and
 Suleymaniyah). Well over 100,000 were added in 1997, due to expulsion by govern-
 ment forces, expulsion by competing Kurdish groups, and intra-Kurdish fighting.
 There were constant reports of forced expulsions of Kurds and Turkomen from
 Kirkuk and Khanaquin: 1,500 persons in April; 1,300 families in May; 440 families
 in July; 1,000 families in September; and 1,750 families in December. The Kurdish
 factions added greatly to this problem by expelling each other's political supporters
 
 
 1459
 from areas that they control and by their renewed fighting. The KDP estimated that
 58,000 KDP supporters were expelled from Suleymaniyah and other PUK-controlled
 areas from October 1996 to October 1997; the PUK says that more than 49,000 of
 its supporters were expelled from Irbil and other KDP-controlled areas from August
 1996 through December 1997. The U.N. reports that more than 10,000 persons were
 forced from their homes when fighting broke out between the Kurdish factions along
 their cease-fire line in October 1997.
 According to the Special Rapporteur, security forces continued to relocate Shi'a in-
 habitants of the southern marshes to major southern cities. Many have been trans-
 ferred to detention centers and prisons in central Iraq, primarily in Baghdad, or
 even to northern cities like Kirkuk as part of the Government's attempt to Arabize"
 traditionally non-Arab areas.
 The Government does not provide first asylum or respect the rights of refugees.
 According to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), hun-
 dreds of thousands of Iraqi refugees remain abroad. Apart from those suspected of
 sympathizing with Iran, most fled after the Government's suppression of the civil
 uprising of 1991; others are Kurds who fled the Anfal Campaign of 1988.
 Of the 1.5 million refugees who fled following the 1991 uprisings, the great major-
 ity, particularly Kurds, have repatriated themselves to northern Iraq in areas where
 the allied coalition has prohibited overflights by Iraqi aircraft. Several hundred
 thousand Kurds remain unsettled in northern Iraq because political circumstances
 do not permit then to return to their former homes in government-controlled terri-
 tory. According to the Special Rapporteur, many of these families still live in tent
 camps under extremely harsh conditions, which result in many deaths, particularly
 among the elderly and young children.
 Approximately.12,000 Turkish Kurds remain in the north who have fled civil
 strife in southeastern Turkey. The UNHCR is treating these displaced persons as
 refugees until-it reaches an official determination of their status. The Atrush refu-
 gee camp was closed in early 1997 and about 1,000 of its residents returned to Tur-
 ey. A total of 6,000 refugees from Atrush. reportedly have moved to the Ayn Sifni
 facility, with most of the remainder relocating to KDP-controlled areas of northern
 Iraq.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens do not have the right to change their government. Although the Govern-
 ment has taken steps-to increase the perception of democracy, the political process
 still was controlled firmly by the State. The 1995 "referendum" on Saddam Hus-
 sein's presidency was not free and was dismissed as a sham -by most international
 observers. It included neither voter privacy, nor opposing candidates, and many cred-
 ible reports indicated that voters feared possible reprisal for a negative vote. A total
 of 500 people reportedly were arrested in Karbala, Baghdad, and Ramadi provinces
 for casting negative ballots, and a member of the intelligence services reportedly
 was executed for refusing to -vote for the President.
 There are strict qualifications for electoral candidates; the candidates for the Na-
 tional Assembly, by law, must be over 25 years old and "believe in God, the prin-
 ciples of the July 17-30 revolution, and socialism." Out of the 250 seats, 160 depu-
 ties reportedly belong to the Ba'ath Party, 60 are independent, and Saddam Hussein
 appointed.30 deputies to represent the northern provinces. According to the Special
 Rapporteur, the Ba'ath Party allegedly instructed a number of its members to run
 as nominally "independent" candidates.
 Full political participation at the national level is confined to members of the
 Arab Ba'ath Socialist Party, estimated at about 8 percent of the population. The po-
 litical system is. dominated by the Party, which governs through the Revolutionary
 Command Council, headed by President Saddam Hussein. However, the RCC exer-
 cises both executive and legislative authority. It overshadows the National Assem-
 bly, which is completely subordinate to it and the executive branch.
 The President wields decisive power over all instruments of government. Almost
 all powerful officials are either members of his family or are family allies from his
 home town of Tikrit.
 -Opposition political organizations are illegal and severely suppressed. Member-
 ship in certain-political parties is punishable- by death (see Section 2.b.). In 1991
 the RCC adopted a law, that theoretically authorized the creation of political parties
 other than the Ba'ath Party; in practice the law is .used to prohibit parties that do
 not support Saddam Hussein and the Government. New parties must be based in
 Baghdad and are prohibited from having any ethnic or religious character.
 The Government does not recognize the various political groupings and parties
 that have been formed by Shi'a Muslims, as well as Kurdish, Assyrian, Turkomen,
 
 
 1460
 and other Iraqi communities. These political groups continued to attract support de-
 spite their illegal status.
 Women and minorities are underrepresented in government and politics. The law
 provides for the election of women and minorities to the National Assembly, but
 they have only token representation.
 In northern Iraq, all central government functions have been performed by local
 administrators, mainly Kurds, since the Government withdrew its military forces
 and civilian administrative personnel from the area after the 1991 uprising. A re-
 gional parliament and local government administrators were elected in 1992. This
 parliament last met in May 1995. Discussions among Kurdish and other northern
 raqi plitical  rups continue on the reconvening of parliament, but fighting be-
 tween the PU and KDP continue to prevent normal parliamentary activity.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The Government does not permit the establishment of independent human rights
 organizations. It operates an official human rights group that routinely denies alle-
 gations of abuses. Citizens have established several human rights groups abroad
 and in northern areas not under government control. Monitors from foreign and
 international human rights groups are not allowed in Iraq.
 As in previous years, the Government did not allow the U.N. Special Rapporteur
 to visit Iraq, nor did it respond to his requests for information. The Government
 continued to defy various calls from U.N. bodies to allow the Special Rapporteur to
 visit the southern marshes and other regions.
 For the fifth consecutive year, the United Nations Human Rights Commission
 (UNHRC) called on the U.N. Secretary General to send human rights monitors to
 "help in the independent verification of reports on the human rights situation in
 Iraq." The U.N. Subcommission on Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of
 Minorities made a similar request. The Government has continued to ignore these
 calls for the entry of monitors.
 The Special Rapporteur nonetheless was able to gather more evidence, in part due
 to interviews with current and past government officials, which shed new light on
 the systemic nature of human rights violations. He dispatched members of his staff
 to Kuwait, Jordan, and other locations to interview victims of government human
 rights abuses.
 The Government harassed and intimidated relief workers and U.N. personnel
 throughout the country, maintained a threat to arrest or kill relief workers in the
 north, staged protests against U.N. offices in the capital, and may have arranged
 for the bombing of a U.N. headquarters in Baghdad (see Sections 1.g. and 2.a.).
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution and the legal system provides for some rights for women, chil-
 dren, and minorities. However, in practice, the Government systematically violates
 these rights.
 Women.-Domestic violence against women occurs but little is known about its ex-
 tent. Such abuse is customarily addressed within the tightly knit family structure.
 There is no public discussion of the subject, and the Government issues no statistics.
 Spousal violence constitutes grounds for. divorce and criminal charges, but suits
 brought on these charges are believed to be rare. Men who kill female family mem-
 bers for "immoral deeds" may receive immunity from prosecution under a 1990 law
 (see Section 1.d.).
 The Special Rapporteur has noted that there is an unusually high percentage of
 women in the Kurdish areas, purportedly caused by the disappearances of tens of
 thousands of Kurdish men during the Anfal Campaign. The Special Rapporteur has
 reported that the widows, daughters, and mothers of the Anfal Campaign victims
 are economically dependent on their relatives or villages because they may not in-
 herit the property or assets of their missing family members.
 Evidence concerning the Anfal Campaign indicates that the Government killed
 many women and children, including infants, by firing squads and in chemical at-
 tacks.
 The Government claims that it is committed to equality for women, who make up
 about 20 percent of the work force. It has enacted laws to protect women from ex-
 ploitation in the workplace and from sexual harassment; to permit women to join
 the regular army, Popular Army, and police forces; to require education for girls;
 and to equalize women's rights in divorce, land ownership, taxation, and suffrage.
 It is difficult to determine to what extent these protections are afforded in practice.
 However, reports indicate that the application of these laws has declined as Iraq's
 
 
 1461
 
 political and economic crisis persists. Women are not allowed to travel outside Iraq
 alone (see Section 2.d.).
 Children.-No information is available on whether the Government -has enacted
 specific legislation to promote the welfare of children. However, the Special
 Rapporteur and several human rights- groups have collected a substantial .body of
 evidence pointing to the Government's continuing disregard for the rights and wel-
 fare of children. This may include government officials taking children from minor-
 ity groups hostage in order to intimidate their families to leave- cities and regions
 ,where the regime wishes to create a Sunni Arab majority (see Section 1.d.).
 The Government's failure to comply with relevant U.N. Security Council resolu-
 tions has led to a continuation of economic sanctions. Exacerbating this situation,
 the regime's implementation of the "oil-for-food" arrangement under UNSCR 986 en-
 sures that those who accede to the regime's policies benefit, while the need of vul-
 nerable demographic groups are ignored. During the year, more than 3 million tons
 of food reached Iraq under UNSCR 986, but the quantity and nutritional content
 of the "food basket" that the Government sells to needy families actually was de-
 creased by government-decree. There are widespread reports that food that should
 have. been made available for the general public was in fact stockpiled in ware-
 -houses ta replenish stocks held by the military. The Government management of the
 program did -not take into account the special requirements of children ages 1 to
 5, despite the-U.N. Secretary General's. specific injunction that the Government
 modify its implementation procedures to address this vulnerable group. The Govern-
 ment twice refused to pump oil during 1997 (for a total of 3 months), causing major
 disruptions in the smooth flow of goods to Iraq. In November there were credible
 press reports that pharmaceutical supplies that should have been directed to sick
 Iraqi children instead were exported or reexported for sale in Jordan, and that $300
 million in medicine and medical supplies that the Government said was needed des-
 perately by children had been delayed because of regime members' demands for
 bribes from suppliers. As a result, health conditions have deteriorated and children
 have been particularly susceptible, except the children of regime supporters.
 In August the Government announced for the fourth year a 3-week training
 course in weapons use, hand-to-hand fighting, rappelling from helicopters and infan-
 try tactics for children 10 to 15 years of age. Camps for these "Saddam Cubs" oper-
 ated throughout the country, with 8,000 children participating in Baghdad alone.
 Senior military officers who supervised the course noted that the children held up
 under the "physical and -psychological strain" of tough training for as long as 14
 hours each day.
 People With Disabilities.-No information -is available on the Government's policy
 towards people with disabilities.
 Religious Minorities.-Iraq's cultural, religious, and linguistic diversity are not re-
 flected in the country's political and economic structure. Various segments of the
 Sunni Arab community, which itself constitutes a small minority of the population,
 have effectively controlled the Government since independence in 1932. Shi'a Arabs,
 the majority of the population, have long been economically, politically, and socially
 .disadvantaged. Like the Sunni Kurds and other ethnic and religious groups in the
 north, the Shia' Arabs of the south have been targeted for particular discrimination
 and abuse, ostensibly because of their opposition to the Government.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-Kurds, who make up approximately 20 per-
 cent of the population, historically have suffered political and economic discrimina-
 tion, despite the token presence of a small number of Kurds in the national Govern-
 ment (see Sections L.a., 1.b., and 1.g.).
 Assyrians are an ethnic group as well as a Christian community (see Section 2.c.).
 They speak a distinct language-Syriac. Public instruction in Syriac, which was to
 have been allowed under a 1972 decree, has never been implemented. Numerous re-
 ports indicated continued systemic discrimination against Assyrians throughout
 1997, especially in terms of forced movements from northern areas and repression
 of political rights there.
 Turkomen and Assyrian volunteers form the backbone of the Peace Monitoring
 Force (PMF) which patroled the cease-fire line between the Kurdish factions. On
 January 23, the semi-official Baghdad newspaper Babel, owned by Uday Hussein,
 warned that the Turkomen and Assyrian communities could "suffer harm" if PMF
 activities continued. The PUK reported in November that families and relatives of
 PMF members living in government-controlled areas have been threatened directly
 by the regime, causing many PMF members to desert from the force. Other sources
 reported that PKK terrorists also had threatened members of the PMF and con-
 ducted attacks on the offices of Turkomen organizations.
 
 
 1462
 
 Citizens considered by the Government to be of Iranian origin must carry special
 identification and are often precluded from desirable employment. Over the years,
 the Government has deported hundreds of thousands of citizens of Iranian origin.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Trade unions independent of government control do
 not exist. The Trade Union Organization Law of 1987 established the Iraqi General
 Federation of Trade Unions (IGFTU), a government-dominated trade union struc-
 ture, as the sole legal trade federation. The IGFTU is linked to the Ba'ath Party,
 which uses it to promote party principles and policies among union members.
 Workers in private and mixed enterprises-but not public employees or workers
 in state enterprises-have the right to join local union committees. The committees
 are affiliated with individual trade unions, which in turn belong to the IGFTU.
 The Labor Law of 1987 restricts the right to strike. No strike has been reported
 over the past two decades. According to the International Confederation of Free
 Trade Unions the severe restrictions on the right to strike include penal sanctions.
 The IGFTJ is affiliated with the International Confederation of Arab Trade
 Unions and the formerly Soviet-controlled World Federation of Trade Unions.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The right to bargain collec-
 tively is not reognized. Salaries for p ubic setor workers (the majority of the em-
 ployed) are set by the Government. Waes in the much smaller private sector are
 set by employers or negotiated individually with workers. Government workers fre-
 quently are shifted from one job and work location to another to prevent them from
 forming close associations with other workers. The Labor Code does not protect
 workers from antiunion discrimination, a failure that has been criticized repeatedly
 -by the International Labor Organization's (ILO) Committee of Experts.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Cornulsory Labor.-Compulsory labor theoretically is
 prohibited by law. However, the enal Code mandates prison sentences, including
 compulsory labor, for civil servants and employees of state enterprises accused of
 breaches of labor "discipline," including resigning from a job. According to the ILO,
 foreign workers in Iraq have been prevented from terminating their employment to
 return to their native countries because of government-imposed penal sanctions on
 persons who do so. There is no information available on forced and bonded labor
 by children.
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment.-The em-
 ployment of children under age 14 is prohibited except in small-scale family enter-
 prises. Children reportedly increasingly are encouraged to work in order to support
 their families, in view of the country's harsh economic conditions. The law stipulates
 that employees between the ages of 14 and 18 work fewer hours per week than
 adults. Each year the Government enrolls children as young as 10 years of age in
 a paramilitary training program (see Section 5). There is no information available
 on forced and bonded labor by children (see Section 6.c.).
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-Theoretically, most workers in urban areas
 work a 6-day, 48-hour workweek. Hours for government employees are set by the
 head of each ministry. Working hours for agricultural workers vary according to in-
 dividual employer-employee agreements. Occupational safety programs are in effect
 in state-run enterprises. Inspectors theoretically inspect private establishments, but
 enforcement varies widely. There is no information on workers' ability to remove
 themselves from work situation that endanger their health or safety, or on those
 who complain about such conditions.
