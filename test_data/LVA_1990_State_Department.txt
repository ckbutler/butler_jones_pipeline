 LATVIA
 Latvia, an independent state between two World Wars, was
 forcibly annexed by the U.S.S.R. in 1940. The United States
 has never recognized Latvia's incorporation into the U.S.S.R.
 Like the other Baltic states, Latvia has been subjected to the*
 same centralized rule, the same constitution and judicial
 system, and the same restrictions on civil, and political
 liberties as in the U.S.S.R. Political and economic power has
 been exercised by the central leadership of the Communist
 Party of the Soviet Union which-tightly controlled the
 activities of local government and Communist Party structures -
 in Latvia.
 However, the Latvian political situation has changed
 dramatically as Latvians have moved to gain greater control
 over their own affairs. In July 1989, the Latvian Supreme
 Council (legislature) adopted a "Declaration of Sovereignty"
 and amended the Latvian Constitution to assert the supremacy
 of its laws over those of the U.S.S.R. Democratic elections
 in March 1990, followed by runoff contests in April, brought
 .proindependence Latvian Popular Front candidates into a
 two-thirds majority in the Latvian Supreme Council. On May 4,
 this body declared its intention to restore full Latvian
 independence after a "transitional" period. Since its
 formation after the March elections, the Popular Front-led
 Government .sought to negotiate Latvia's independence from
 Moscow.
 The primary law enforcement -rganization is the .militia
 (police). The Committee for State Security (KGB), special
 troops of the Ministry of Internal Affairs (MVD), and regular
 Soviet armed forces, which maintain a significant presence in
 Latvia, are controlled by Moscow. KGB-surveillance of
 political and.human rights activists continues. In June the
 Latvian Suprem-Council passed legislation to depoliticize law
 enforcement institutions. The Latvian Government has
 established some independent police units.
 The standard of living in Latvia continues to be higher than
 the 'Soviet everage, hut the economy is in decline. Most
 Latvian industry remains tied to the Soviet economy. The
 Latvian Supreme Council has been-developing -plans for
 establishing economic autonomy.
 The human rights .situation continued to improve. The first
 major legislation adapted by Latvia's newly elected Supreme
 Council was a declaration of accession to 51 international
 covenants and conventions on human rights,-imcluding all three
 major documents of the Conference on Security and Cooperation
 in Europe and all human rights documents passed by the
 European Parliament. Freedom of speech, press, assembly,
 association, and religion was widely respected. However,
 progress was limited, both in Latvia and the t.S.S.R., in
 adopting legislative reforms that would institutionalize human
 rights improvements. In January 1991, dozens of unarmed
 protesters were killed or wounded by Soviet troops taking over
 government and Communist Party buildings in the Baltics.

 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 There were no known cases of such killing in 1990.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no known instances of abductions or disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment and Punishment
 Prisons in Latvia are still administered according to Soviet
 practice. Harsh treatment of prisoners occurs during both
 interrogation and confinement in labor camps and prisons.
 Physical and psychological abuse of prisoners, overcrowding,
 and detention under extremely unhealthful conditions are
 common.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.
 Soviet laws in force continue to allow arbitrary arrest and
 detention, although in 1990 Soviet authorities did not use
 these laws to arrest political activists. In one case, an
 American citizen of Latvian origin working for a Latvian
 ministry was detained and expelled from Latvia by
 Soviet-controlled security organs. No formal charges were
 filed. The Latvian Government protested this action.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Despite proposals and draft legislation to increase the
 independence of the judiciary, the State is still able to
 exercise control over the judicial process and to determine
 the outcome of public trials. Procedural safeguards, such as
 the right to a public trial and to a defense attorney, are
 generally respected but are not sufficient to guarantee fair
 trials. In practice, however, the Latvian judiciary appears
 to act independently. In 1990 no trials of a political
 character occurred. In the summer the Latvian Government
 named its own chief procurator, a move condemned by the
 U.S.S.R. procurator, who named his own candidate. As a
 result, two chief procurators now operate in Latvia.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence.
 Soviet-controlled security organs interfere in personal life
 through the use of informers and technical surveillance,
 including the opening of mail and wiretaps. In 1990 they did
 not take action to curb the growth in political expression.
 The contacts of Latvians with foreigners continued to be
 monitored, but neither the knowledge of this monitoring nor
 the authorities themselves have hindered the growth of these
 contacts.

 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 In 1990"Latvia enjoyed wide freedom of speech. There was
 unfettered criticism of the Soviet and Latvian Governments,
 and no subject appeared off-limits to the increasingly
 aggressive press... In-May the-newly elected Supreme Council
 began debate on a new press law that would formally establish
 freedom of the press and outlaw censorship.
 The Communist Party still retains formal control over many
 publications, but independent journals enjoy wide popularity.*
 Unauthorized publications flourished without restriction. In
 June the Latvian Supreme Council voted to nationalize the main
 publishing house in Riga, thereby reducing the Communist
 Party's ownership to a 30-percent share. However, in
 defending ' U.S.S.R. ruling protecting party property,
 security forces under Soviet government control occupied the
 main press building. Nevertheless, press operations,
 including the printing of both Communist and non-Communist
 newspapers and journals, were not hindered. The Latvian
 Supreme Council in 1990 outlawed the party organtizations in
 the State Committee for Television and-Radio Broadcasting and
 the Latvian Telegraph Agency.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Latvian authorities retain the power to prohibit public
 gatherings, according to a more liberal version of Soviet
 guidelines on demonstrations and meetings adopted by the
 Latvian Supreme Council in 1989. In 1990 numerous mass
 meetings- and demonstrations took place without official
 hindrance. Mass rallies were unhindered during the May 4
 declaration of independence and the spring election campaign.
 During an anti-independence-demonstration on May 15, the
 crowd, largely comprised of Soviet servicemen, tried to force
 their way into the Supreme Council building. In the ensuing
 struggle with police, a number of demonstrators reportedly
 suffered-minor injuries. On August 23, bonfire rallies were
 held throughout the country commemorating the 1939 Molotov-
 Ribbentrop Nonaggression Pact. In October the Popular Front -
 held its third congress, and many other political groupings of
 varied stripe have held public congresses.
 The Latvian Constitution, still in force, provides for the
 right to associate in public organizations., Although in the
 past repressive practices occurred, the number of associations
 of all types, professional, religious, academic, registered,..
 and unregistered, continued to grow rapidly in 1990. No
 harassment of any of these groups was noted.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Since 1989, Latvian authorities have dramatically changed the
 policy from promoting atheism to supporting religious
 freedom. In 1989 Christmas was made an official holiday, and
 church services commenced once again in Riga's main Lutheran
 Cathedral. In 1990 Easter and Good Friday were made official
 holidays. Riga University opened a theological faculty, and
 in June the first Jewish school in the Baltics opened in
 Riga. Religious instruction by priests and ministers is
 permitted in grammar schools. Evangelists from foreign
 countries have also been permitted to hold mass religious
 meetings. Each major religious grouping-has its own
 
 
 1204
 LATVIA
 publication, and distribution of Bibles and religious
 materials of all sorts is unhindered. There have been no
 known instances of discrimination based on-religious belief.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Freedom of movement is neither guaranteed by law nor fully
 respected in practice, although Soviet officials have publicly
 pledged to bring their legislation into conformity with
 international standards. The right to emigrate is not
 recognized, and persons wishing to leave temporarily are
 generally required to present an invitation from abroad.
 Bureaucratic hindrances to travel are fewer in Latvia than in
 the U.S.S.R. The number of Latvians traveling to the United
 States continued to increase, including representatives of the
 Government, the religious'faiths, and political and social
 organizations.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 For the first time since World War II, Latvians exercised
 their right to change their government by voting into the
 Supreme Council a majority of non-Communist candidates who
 campaigned under the banner of the Latvian Popular Front.
 These elections, by secret ballot, were considered generally
 free and democratic. However, despite the election of a
 non-Communist Government, effective economic and security
 control remains in Moscow's hands. There is no
 discrimination, in law or in practice, in the participation of
 women in government and politics.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 No requests for such investigations are known to have been
 made in 1990. The Government did not object to any inquiries
 by foreign and nongovernmental observers on human rights.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Discrimination on the basis of race, sex, or other grounds is
 prohibited iii the Latvian Constitution. Tensions are present,
 however, in the relationship between Latvians and the large
 Russian population in Latvia. Since its forcible
 incorporation into the U.S.S.R., Latvia has experienced a
 dramatic increase in the immigration of non-Latvians, largely
 Russians, brought in as laborers and administrators. Today,
 Latvians constitute approximately half of the population.
 Stormy discussions were held in the Latvian Supreme Council on
 defining Latvian citizenship.
 Women possess the same legal rights as men and have
 significant day care and maternity benefits. Women also,
 under law, receive equal pay for equal work. Nevertheless, in
 Latvian society as a whole, they tend to be employed in less
 remunerative jobs than men.
 Statistics on the problem of violence against women, including
 wife beating, are unavailable. The official Soviet press
 discussed the issue, and in 1989 the Soviet Council of
 
 
 1205
 
 LATVIA
 Ministers established a special branch (headed by a woman) to
 study the problems of women. Human rights and women's rights
 groups in Latvia are aware of the issue but have focused their
 efforts thus far on the broader 4uestion of independence and
 freedom.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Soviet labor law and practice has generally been enforced in
 Latvia. There is no right of association as defined by the
 International Labor Organization. Although the Constitution
 grants'Soviet citizens the right to form trade unions,
 attempts to exercise this right independently of the.
 state-controlled union had always been repressed. The Latvian
 Trade Union Congress was the official Communist-controlled
 union until May. Its leadership, membership, and politics
 reflect the predominance of Russians in Latvian industries.
 There was little, if any, independent labor union activity in
 1990. The first Latvian Congress of Free Trade Unions in May
 appeared to be merely the Latvian Trade Union -Congress under a
 new guise. In 1990 the Latvian Supreme Council began debate
 on labor union regulation.
 Several strikes were reported in the press in 1990, and none
 were repressed by force. In May several hours of "political
 warning strikes" occurred, coordinated by the pro-'oscow
 United Council of Labor Collectives, to protest the Latvian
 Supreme Council's declaration of independence.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 Under existing law, workers in Latvia have not been able to
 organize or bargain collectively. There are no export
 processing zones..
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Soviet law contains no prohibition on forced or compulsory
 labor. Most prisoners are confined to camps in which they are
 forced to labor, often under harsh and degrading conditions.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 The statutory minimum.age for employment of children is 16.
 Minimum age and compulsory education laws are, by all
 accounts, enforced by state authorities through inspections.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 In May Latvia voluntarily began to try to bring its laws into
 accord with international conventions concerning work
 conditions. It later amended the labor code to provide for a
 mandatory 40-hour maximum workweek, 4 weeks of annual
 vacation, and a program of assistance to working mothers with
 small children. Labor conditions in Latvia are somewhat
 better than in the U.S.S.R. Wages are significantly higher,
 and worker amenities are considered better than in the
 U.S.S.R. In accord with Soviet law, minimum health and safety
 standards exist in Latvia but, judging from media reports,
 appear to be little enforced.
