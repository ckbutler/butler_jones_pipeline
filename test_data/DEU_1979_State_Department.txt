 FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF GERMANY
 
 The West Germans are acutely conscious of the central
 importance of human rights and civil liberties because
 of still-living memories of the atrocities of the Nazi
 period, the mass uprooting of millions of Germans from
 their homes at the end of World War II, the division
 of Germany and resultant division of families, and the
 presence of ethnic Germans in the communist countries
 of Eastern Europe and the USSR who wish either to
 emigrate to the West or to enjoy more cultural
 autonomy. There is among West Germans broad funda-
 mental agreement on the need to preserve human rights
 within the Federal Republic and to promote human
 rights in Europe. Basic human rights are provided for
 in the Constitution (Basic Law) of 1949 and they are
 scrupulously protected.
 Terrorist incidents perpetrated by individuals from
 within West Germany's own society have posed a
 particularly difficult problem for the Federal Republic
 since the early 1970s. While the political, economic,
 social and psychological causes of German terrorism
 are complex, the terrorists have made clear their
 anarchistic aim of destroying the constitutional
 structure and democratic values of the Federal Republic.
 The Government has taken special care to safeguard
 basic civil liberties of individuals while taking
 measures to combat violence and terrorism. Although
 there were no major acts of terrorism in the Federal
 Republic in 1979, the need to preserve the delicate
 balance between internal security requirements and
 civil liberties remained the overriding theme in West
 German public and parliamentary debate on specific
 anti-terrorist measures.
 The Federal Republic's attitude toward human rights is
 also reflected in its economic assistance to developing
 countries, the supportive human rights role it has played
 in the United Nations and in the institutions of the
 Council of Europe, its general support for the inclusion of
 human rights concerns in the decision-making process
 of international financial institutions, its con-
 tribution to the resettlement of Indochinese refugees
 of which 10,000 have arrived in the Federal Republic,
 its efforts to facilitate the emigration of ethnic Germans
 from the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, its compensation
 of victims of Nazism and its support of the remaining Jewish
 community.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 Freedom from torture is guaranteed by law and respected
 in practice.
 
 (598)
 
 
 599
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Freedom from cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or
 punishment is guaranteed by law and respected in practice.
 Under legislation passed in October 1977, a person in
 custody suspected of involvement in a terrorist con-
 spiracy may be denied any contacts with the outside
 world if 1) the accused is charged with involvement in
 a terrorist conspiracy, 2) there are grounds to believe
 that the conspiracy is being directed from the prison
 where the accused is in custody, and 3) there is present
 danger to life or health of a person (e.g., a hostage
 being held by terrorists). This "contact bar" is
 possible only for a maximum of fourteen days unless
 extended by a court. Pursuant to this legislation,
 some persons accused or convicted of terrorism have
 been confined in isolation. Amnesty International has
 advised the Federal Republic of its concern that in
 individual cases this isolation may have impaired the
 health of the prisoners.
 c. Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 Freedom from arbitrary arrest or imprisonment is
 guaranteed by law and respected in practice. There may
 be some individuals currently in jail who believe they
 are political prisoners, but all were convicted of
 criminal acts of violence. Although there is no right of
 habeus corpus, its equivalent is achieved by the established
 rTriiipl-etgat no prisoner may be held longer than
 twenty-four hours without a court warrant. A detainee
 may be held longer than twenty-four hours while
 awaiting formal charges by a court order only if there
 are grounds to believe he would attempt to flee the
 country to avoid prosecution. Bail bond does not exist in
 the Federal Republic, and it is possible for a defendant
 after arraignment before a judge to spend a lengthy period
 in detention awaiting trial.
 d. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The right to fair public trial is guaranteed by the
 Federal Republic's Constitution, federal law and
 customary practice. Under German law, defendants are
 entitled to legal counsel which is provided by the state if
 the defendants cannot afford to pay. Legislation which
 entered into force in April 1978 provided for stricter
 controls of the printed material and other objects which a
 lawyer representing a terrorist in prison may take to
 his client. This was done to prevent the smuggling
 into prison of small arms and communications devices
 by lawyers, as had apparently occurred in several
 cases. An attorney may be excluded from criminal cases
 involving persons suspected of terrorist conspiracy if
 specific facts exist which support a suspicion that
 the attorney is implicated in the conspiracy. This
 legislation, which has generated domestic debate, does
 not, however, deny legal counsel to terrorist
 
 
 600
 prisoners, who may either choose or be assigned other
 counsel not suspected of being implicated in the
 conspiracy.
 Under German law, defendants may be convicted only on
 the basis of evidence brought forth in trial. All
 charges and evidence must be made known to the counsel
 for the defense. The defendant may challenge the
 validity of the evidence against him and may introduce
 countervailing evidence.
 The courts are independent. There are no special
 courts for security or political offenses. Civilians
 are not tried by military courts. Most military
 personnel accused of crimes are tried in civilian
 courts with the military judicial system coming to bear
 only on minor administrative problems such as unauthorized
 leave.
 e. Invasion of the Home
 The sanctity of the home is guaranteed in the eon-
 stitution and respected in practice. A warrant
 signed by a judge is required in most cases before
 the police may make a forcible entry. The law permits
 public prosecutors to issue warrants in an emergency
 if a judge cannot be found, and some German citizens
 have raised the question as to whether this "loophole"
 may have been abused in certain narcotics and terrorists
 cases.
 2. Government Policies Relating to the Fulfillment of
 Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care
 and Education
 The German economy is strongly grounded in an economic
 philosophy advocating a maximization of free market
 forces and private enterprise. The population of about
 61 million is expected to decline slowly in the years
 ahead. The country is highly urbanized and industrially
 advanced, with a working force of nearly 25 million and
 an average unemployment rate in 1979 of 4 percent. The
 gross national product in 1978 in current prices stood
 at about 1,287 billion DM.
 German society is basically open and free of major social
 disturbances. There are some longstanding problems of
 integration of foreign workers into the mainstream of
 German life, but efforts are being made by the Government,
 with some success, toward solutions. There is a large
 and well-developed program of social assistance to dis-
 advantaged segments of German society. Social welfare
 programs, including health insurance, unemployment
 benefits, disability, etc. are very comprehensive and
 of long standing. Income is high and broadly distributed.
 Average weekly income for male industrial workers at the
 end of 1977 stood at DM 513 compared to DM 282 in 1970
 and DM 64 in 1950. The tax structure is generally
 progressive.
 
 
 601
 Private ownership of property is widespread. About 40
 per cent of the population lives in single family
 dwellings, mostly owner-occupied; 20 per cent live in
 duplex units; and 40 per cent in apartments, some of
 which are condominiums. In 1977, there were 312
 passenger cars per thousand inhabitants, the highest
 percentage of all the EC countries with the exception
 of Luxembourg. Health care is excellent and
 individuals are well covered by extensive compulsory
 as well as private health insurance schemes. In 1977,
 there was one doctor for every 503 inhabitants,
 compared to the general European average of 583.
 Schooling through the secondary level is free and
 compulsory. Approximately 19 per cent of the total
 population was enrolled at schools and universities
 in 1976/77. Public schools and universities are
 distributed in every part of the country.
 3. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 Freedom of speech, press, religion and assembly is firmly
 anchored in the Constitution as part of a "bill of rights"
 that is not subject to amendment. In certain limited
 circumstances, the Government may restrict the exercise of
 these liberties by those hostile to the democratic
 constitutional system. There is, for example, legislation
 prohibiting distribution of written material which
 advocates criminal acts.
 b. Freedom of Movement within the Countryi Foreign
 Travel and Emigration
 The freedom to move about within the country, travel
 abroad or leave the country permanently is guaranteed
 by law and respected in practice. The Federal Republic
 has been notably successful in facilitating emigration
 to the West of ethnic Germans wishing to leave the
 Soviet Union and Eastern Europe.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Freedom to participate in the political process is
 protected. The Federal Republic is a multi-party
 democracy. Opposition parties function freely, actively
 and with a good chance of success in future elections.
 The media are available to all parties and public
 meetings are not restricted.
 Radical political parties are permitted to participate
 in local, state and federal elections. Since some
 radical parties and groups aim at overthrowing the
 constitutional order, the federal and state governments
 agreed in January 1972 on general principles to bar
 members of such parties and groups from civil service
 employment. However, the criteria for screening
 
 
 602
 applicants for civil service are not uniformly
 administered in all states of the Federal Republic of
 Germany and this issue has remained the subject of
 public debate. In a few cases, the application of the
 principles has barred persons from employment in civil
 service.
 The status of women is legally equal to men in every
 respect. Women have achieved positions of high status
 in all fields. But their overall participation in
 political and economic life is not growing rapidly.
 In many areas they remain both underrepresented and
 at the bottom of the pay scale. Part of the explanation
 for this is the lingering strength of the traditional
 German view of what constitute proper or expected roles
 for women.
 The trade union movement in the Federal Republic is
 active and effective. A network of laws and customs
 protects the right to organize, strike, and bargain
 collectively.
 4. Government Attitude and Record Regarding International
 and Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged
 Violations of Human Rights
 The Federal Republic was one of the first states to
 ratify, in 1952, the European Convention for the
 Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms and
 to subject itself to the international controls exercised
 by the European Human Rights Commission and the European
 Court of Human Rights. Since that time, numerous
 individual complaints, among them complaints by terrorists,
 have been reviewed in judicial proceedings by the European
 Commission on Human Rights. There has been only one case
 in which it was established that the Federal Republic had
 violated the Convention.  (The Commission ruled in the
 Koenig case, in June 1978, that the duration of
 proceedings in an administrative dispute was excessive.)
 The Federal Republic has also ratified the United Nations
 International Covenants on Human Rights.
 The Federal Republic will provide responses to queries or
 other communications put to it by human rights investigators
 and in some cases has conducted its own investigations as
 a complementary effort. Individuals and teams from abroad
 have been permitted to work in the country--Amnesty
 International is perhaps the most prominent--and the
 government has assisted such efforts.
