 THE BAHAMAS
 The Bahamas is a constitutional, multiparty democracy. As a
 member of the British Commonwealth, its political and legal
 traditions are similar to those of Great Britain. The Queen
 of England is recognized as Head of State, and she is
 represented by an appointed Governor General. The Progressive
 Liberal Party (PLP) has governed since 1967 under the same
 leader, Prime Minister Sir Lynden 0. Pindling, and it retained
 power following general elections in June 1987.
 The police and small defense force respect the human rights
 provisions of the Constitution and the law. There have,
 however, been allegations of mistreatment of some prisoners by
 the police. The Bahamas has a well-established judicial
 system based on common law and British procedures. Violent
 crime, drug addiction, and narcotics trafficking continue to
 be serious societal problems.
 Tourism is the mainstay of the economy, accounting for
 approximately 60 percent of the gross national product;
 finance and off-shore banking is the second most important
 sector. Government efforts to diversify the economy have met
 with little success.
 The Constitution provides for the protection of fundamental
 rights and freedoms without discrimination by reason of sex,
 race, religion, origin, or political opinion, and its
 provisions are generally observed. The Bahamas' overall human
 rights record was good in 1988.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There were no reports of killing for political motives.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reports of politically motivated abductions or
 disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 The Constitution prohibits torture and other forms of cruel or
 degrading treatment or punishment. However, both Americans
 and Bahamians detained by police continue to report instances
 of police brutality in the course of arrests and
 interrogations. Three persons died while incarcerated this
 year, officially from natural causes. Some family members,
 however, blamed the Government for neglect and attributed the
 deaths to overcrowded, unhealthful conditions in the country's
 only prison, Nassau's Foxhill facility. This prisonhas been
 characterized as cramped and dirty, and, it is said, the food
 provided inmates is barely adequate. In response to a
 longstanding invitation from the Grand Bahama Human Rights
 Organization, Americas, Watch was scheduled to visit The
 Bahamas December 12-17 to investigate prison conditions.

 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The Constitution prohibits arbitrary arrest and detention.
 The right to a judicial determination of the legality of
 detention is respected; charges are normally brought within 48
 hours of arrest, and those arrested are usually allowed access
 to an attorney of their own choosing.
 Arbitrary mass arrests of Haitians suspected of being illegal
 residents did not recur in 1988. In May the Grand Bahamas
 Human Rights Association and L'Abri Ministries (an umbrella
 group of religious organizations) publicly announced their
 willingness to withdraw their 1987 petition to the Inter-
 American Commission of Human Rights of the Organization of
 American States denouncing the Government for its treatment of
 Haitians.
 With regard to forced or compulsory labor, see Section 6.c.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 An independent judiciary, appointed by the executive branch on
 the advice of a judicial and legal service commission,
 conducts fair and public trials. The Constitution entitles
 defendants to counsel, and access to defendants is freely
 permitted. Legal representation at public expense is provided
 only for capital cases. There are no political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Government does not interfere in the private lives of its
 citizens. The Constitution prohibits arbitrary entry, search,
 or seizure, and the law requires warrants to be issued before
 privately owned property can be entered and searched. The
 Government neither censors mail nor restricts receipt of
 foreign correspondence or publications.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Free speech and press are exercised in The Bahamas, but there
 are certain constraints. There are three privately owned
 daily newspapers, one weekend paper, and one government-owned
 radio and television station. Political parties also publish
 newspapers. While there is no government censorship, the
 press does refrain from coverage of certain figures and events
 because of the country's stringent libel laws. The largest
 paper, the Nassau Guardian, continued throughout 1988 to avoid
 reporting on developments in an extradition case involving a
 local attorney accused of drug trafficking, due to libel
 concerns. The 1986 libel case accusing the editor of the
 opposition party's newspaper of criminal libel of Prime
 Minister Pindling resulted in acquittal in March 1988. In
 June the hotel room of a U.S. reporter for Forbes magazine
 doing an investigative report in Nassau was searched by police
 who refused to identify themselves or produce a search
 warrant. The authorities later denied the search was an
 attempt to pressure the journalist.
 While the press is considered to be generally free, opposing
 points of view are not usually accorded fair radio and
 television treatment. The opposition party is prohibited by
 1974 legislation from purchasing air time to broadcast its
 
 
 448
 THE BAHAMAS
 views and is allotted only one broadcast each year, the
 duration of the program being determined by the number of
 seats held by the opposition in Parliament. Opposition
 leaders took advantage of a September Caribbean broadcasters'
 meeting in Nassau to denounce the Government's control of the
 broadcast media. Recent press articles have also called for
 an end to the Government's monopoly.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Constitution provides for the right to free assembly and
 association and these rights are observed in practice.
 For a discussion of freedom of association as it applies to
 labor unions, see Section 6.a.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 There is full freedom of religion in The Bahamas, and
 discrimination based on creed is prohibited. There is no
 favored or official state religion, but most church members
 belong to Protestant denominations.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Citizens are free to travel within The Bahamas and abroad, and
 there are no restrictions on the right to change residence or
 workplace. Large groups of Haitians continued to enter
 Bahamian waters, and the Bahamian Defense Force and the U.S.
 Coast Guard have cooperated in repatriating them.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 The Bahamas is a constitutional democracy with a multiparty
 political system. The political process is open to all
 members of society, with citizens aged 18 and over eligible to
 register and vote. There are two principal parties: the
 governing Progressive Liberal Party (PLP) and the opposition
 Free National Movement (FNM). The PLP led the country for 5
 years of internal self-government before independence in 1973
 and has held power without interruption since.
 General elections were held in June 1987 in which the PLP was
 returned to power with a clear parliamentary majority. The
 FNM, however, claiming extensive electoral violations,
 challenged the results in the electoral court. The PLP
 responded by challenging seats won by the FNM. The electoral
 court has ruled on only a few of the challenges. Because of a
 lack of substantiated documentation of fraud, it has yet to
 overturn any of the official results.
 Female members of both parties hold House of Assembly and
 Senate seats, and two women in the House and three in the
 Senate have leadership roles.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Americas' Watch was scheduled to visit The Bahamas December
 12-17. Otherwise, no international human rights organization
 visited The Bahamas to investigate human rights conditions
 during the year. The Government has generally not been active
 
 
 THE BAHAMAS
 in human rights affairs but has strongly criticized human
 rights violations in South Africa.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 The law prohibits discrimination on grounds of sex, race, and
 religion, and The Bahamas has a good record in this regard.
 Women participate prominently at all levels of government and
 are well represented in the judiciary as well as in
 professional and business sectors. The country's first female
 Supreme Court justice was appointed in 1988. There does not
 appear to be a significant wage gap. The Constitution does,
 however, make several distinctions between the sexes regarding
 citizenship by, for example, preventing female Bahamians from
 bestowing citizenship upon their spouses. Women's rights
 activists have charged that Bahamian law puts women at a
 disadvantage concerning child care, inheritance, and property
 ownership.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 The constitutional provision for the right of free assembly
 and association specifically mentions labor unions, and unions
 operate freely without restriction. They are independent of
 government control, have the right to strike, choose their own
 delegations to the International Labor. Organization (ILO), and
 maintain affiliations with international and regional labor
 organizations.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 Workers are free to organize, and unions engage in collective
 bargaining without government interference or restriction in
 any sector. Collective bargaining is extensive for the 30
 percent of the work force which is organized. The Department
 of Labor attempts to mediate disputes, and the law provides
 for arbitration tribunals to help break stalled contract
 negotiations. Unionization of retail store and restaurant
 employees has been discouraged over the years by employer
 pressure and arbitrary dismissal practices. Labor laws and
 regulations are enforced uniformly throughout the country.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 The Constitution specifically prohibits forced or compulsory
 labor, which are nonexistent in practice.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 There is no legal minimum age for the employment of children.
 Although the law does not specifically address child labor,
 the requirement of compulsory education until age 14
 effectively discourages child employment.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 Under the Fair Labor Standards Act, employers cannot permit
 their employees to work more than 48 hours a week. This
 provision is effectively enforced. In 1988 Parliament passed
 a law authorizing maternity leave for female workers which
 guaranteed their right to reemployment following the child's
 birth. The Labor Department conducts periodic checks of work-
 
 
 45
 THE BAHAMAS
 places to ensure lighting, safety, and ventilation standards
 are met. There is no minimum wage law in The Bahamas; however
 wage levels in this primarily service-oriented, tourist-based
 economy are considered to provide a decent standard of living
 for workers.
