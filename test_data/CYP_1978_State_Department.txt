 CYPRUS
 
 As noted in last year's report, human rights questions
 resulting from past intercommunal troubles and the
 events of 1974 are an integral element of the Cyprus
 problem and will no doubt figure prominently in any
 settlement reached between the two Cypriot communities.
 The communities frequently take opposing views on
 questions of human rights as they do on the political
 and social issues which separate them. The continuing
 presence of Turkish military forces in Cyprus is a
 pertinent-example. The Government of Cyprus maintains
 that Turkey is in occupation of part of the sovereign
 state of Cyprus in violation of international law and
 United Nations resolutions; the Turkish Cypriots,
 although in agreement that outside armed forces should
 be withdrawn in accordance with a final settlement,
 argue that, until then, a Turkish military presence is
 required to guarantee Turkish Cypriot security.
 Another major difference centers on the resolution of
 the serious refugee problem arising from the 1974
 fighting, the subsequent de facto division of the
 island, and the large-scale movement of Greek Cypriots
 to the south and Turkish Cypriots to the north. The
 Government of Cyprus maintains that all refugees must
 be permitted to return to their homes, while the
 Turkish Cypriot leadership argues that this principle
 must be interpreted in the light of the resettlement
 of Greek and Turkish refugees in new areas, the need
 for a bicommunal and bizonal Cyprus, and Turkish
 Cypriot security concerns.
 In a report prepared in 1976-1977 in response to two
 Government of Cyprus petitions, the European Commission
 on Human Rights found the Government of Turkey respon-
 sible for six violations of the European Convention on
 Human Rights for its actions in Cyprus in 1974-1975.
 The Government of Turkey subsequently published a
 rebuttal charging that Greek Cypriots violated Turkish
 Cypriot human rights on a massive scale during the
 
 (443)
 
 
 444
 1963-1974 period. On January 20, 1979 the Council of
 Europe decided to consider its investigation of the
 two Government of Cyprus complaints closed and to make
 available the Commission report, the Turkish rebuttal
 and other relevant documents. A third Government of
 Cyprus petition claiming continuing Turkish violations
 of human rights in Cyprus is pending before the
 European Commission on Human Rights.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 There are no indications that torture is permitted or
 practiced by the Government of Cyprus, the Turkish
 Cypriot administration, or Turkish forces in northern
 Cyprus.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Freedom from cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or
 punishment is guaranteed by law in both communities
 and has been respected in practice during the past year.
 c. Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 Freedom from arbitrary arrest or imprisonment is
 guaranteed by law and respected in practice in both
 communities.
 d. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Fair public trial is guaranteed and provided in both
 communities.
 e. Invasion of the Home
 Inviolability of the home (except with judicial warrant)
 is guaranteed by the Cyprus Constitution. A "consti-
 tution" adopted by the Turkish Cypriots in 1975 has a
 similar guarantee of inviolability of the home for every
 
 
 445
 Turkish Cypriot. There is no evidence that these
 guarantees are not being respected. The Greek Cypriot
 population resident in the Turkish Cypriot-administered
 area continues to decline slowly as families and in-
 dividuals move to the Government-controlled area. As
 noted in Secretary-General Waldheim's May 1978 report
 on Cyprus, all transfers of population are monitored
 by officials of the United Nations Force in Cyprus to
 ensure that they are voluntary. No deliberate eviction
 policy appears to be in effect at present.
 2. Governmental Policies Relating to the Fulfillment
 of Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care
 and Education
 The Government of Cyprus and the Turkish Cypriot ad-
 ministration continue to devote .extraordinary portions
 of their respective budgets to providing assistance to
 the thousands of persons displaced as a consequence of
 the 1974 crisis. Housing, employment, education and
 health programs have been designed and implemented,
 assisted by large-scale United States and other inter-
 national contributions. Both communities have well-
 developed social insurance and health-care systems.
 There is no evidence of widespread or systematic
 corruption.
 3. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Includ-
 ing:
 a. Freedom of Thought, Speech, Press, Religion
 and Assembly
 Freedom of thought, speech, press and assembly exists
 in both sectors. Freedom of religion is also consti-
 tutionally guaranteed in both communities. The United
 Nations Secretary-General has noted in his May 1978
 report on Cyprus that there appear to be no restric-
 tions on the freedom of worship for Greek Cypriots
 residing in the Turkish Cypriot-administered area
 wherever the services of a priest are available.
 
 
 446
 Labor unions in both-communities are active and free
 of governmental control. Strikes are permitted. While'
 to a certain extent traditional patterns persist, there
 is no systematic discrimination against women in law
 or practice in either community.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel and Emigration
 Turkish and Greek Cypriots enjoy normal freedom of
 movement within their respective sectors. As reported
 by the United Nations Secretary-General, Turkish
 Cypriot authorities have relaxed some of the restric-
 tions on travel by the Greek Cypriot population in the
 north, but Greek Cypriots still do not have the same
 freedom of movement there as do Turkish Cypriots.
 There are no restrictions on freedom of movement of
 Turkish Cypriots residing in the Government-controlled
 area. Travel between the two sectors is extremely
 limited, but some is permitted on humanitarian grounds.
 As a result of policies adopted by both the Government
 and the Turkish Cypriot authorities denying access to
 their respective sectors by individuals who have
 entered Cyprus-through the ports or airport in the
 other sector, freedom of movement throughout the island
 ordinarily is not possible for visitors to Cyprus.
 The right to travel abroad or emigrate is observed,
 although there are some restrictions on exit permits
 for those of military service age. In view of labor
 shortages, some controls also are exercised in the
 Government-controlled area over those seeking employ-
 ment abroad.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 The Government of Cyprus is organized under a Consti-
 tution in accordance with Western democratic and repre-
 sentative models. Suffrage is universal. The Turkish
 Cypriot administration was democratically elected in
 accordance with procedures based on Western models.

 4. Governmental Attitude and Record Regarding Inter-
 national and Non-Governmental Investigation of
 Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Despite agreement in principle, the two Cypriot com-
 munities have been unable during the past year to reach
 a concrete understanding on the terms of reference and
 operational procedures for a joint committee to in-
 vestigate cases of missing persons on both sides.
 The Turkish Cypriot administration has consistently
 rejected resolutions or determinations reached in
 various international organizations, including human
 rights groups, in which its representatives do not have
 equal status with the Government of Cyprus' represen-
 tatives.
