 AFGHANISTAN
 In April 1978, a bloody Communist coup toppled the government
 of Afghanistan and, following the execution of many of the
 previous government's leaders and their families, led to the
 creation of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan (DRA). The
 nominal leadership of the new regime was drawn from the
 People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan (PDPA), a badly
 factionalized Communist party. After a period of intense
 intraparty feuding and in the face of growing popular
 resistance to the Marxist regime, the Soviet Union invaded its
 small, nonaligned neighbor in December 1979, After 7 years of
 fighting, between 116,000 and 118,000 Soviet troops, together
 with the dwindling armed forces of the Kabul regime, were still
 attempting to crush the resistance--the mujahidin--whom the
 vast majority of the Afghan people continued to support. In
 May 1986, the Soviets engineered the ouster of Babrak Karmal
 as General Secretary of the PDPA and his replacement with the
 Soviet-trained Najibullah, former head of KHAD, the Afghan
 secret police.
 Through a campaign of indiscriminate air and artillery
 bombardment, the Soviets and the Kabul regime have sought to
 terrorize the Afghan people into submitting to the regime's
 authority or fleeing the country. As a result, conditions in
 the country have deteriorated to the point that the U.N.
 Special Rapporteur, in his report on the human rights situation
 in Afghanistan submitted in February 1986, stated that
 .continuation of the military solution will, in the opinion of
 the Special Rapporteur, lead inevitably to a situation
 approaching genocide." This policy has resulted in the violent
 disruption of the lives of over one-third of Afghanistan's
 prewar population of 15 million and the deaths of hundreds of
 thousands of Afghan civilians.
 Reports such as that of the U.N. Special Rapporteur detail the
 number and scope of violations of international humanitarian
 law being carried out with impunity by the Soviets and the
 Kabul regime. Such laws include the 1949 Geneva Conventions
 and customary international law for the protection of civilians
 which proscribe murder, mutilation, and the massive use of
 antipersonnel weapons; the 1925 Geneva Protocol and the 1972
 Biological and Toxic Weapons Conventions; the 1954 Hague
 Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the
 Event of Armed Conflict; and prohibitions against torture and
 other cruel treatment or punishment, including Article 7 of
 the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.
 The immediate objective of the Soviet occupation is the
 establishment in Kabul of a secure and pliable client regime.
 However, the Soviets' long-term objective appears to be the
 absorption of Afghanistan into the Socialist camp. To this
 end, Soviet advisers since 1979 have moved steadily into
 controlling positions in Afghan ministries, the armed forces,
 and the party. They now make or heavily influence all
 significant political, military, and socioeconomic decisions
 nominally made by the Najibullah regime. After 8 years of
 Marxist rule, the regime's power extends only to Kabul and a
 few other areas heavily guarded by Soviet forces.
 Afghanistan was among the world's poorest nations before the
 war began. Soviet and DRA military operations have further
 impoverished the Afghan people, disrupted internal and foreign
 trade and communications, and led to a general degradation of
 the quality of life for those who have not fled. The reduction
 in living standards has been compounded by the Soviets' and
 
 
 1095
 AFGHANISTAN
 DRA's deliberate destruction of the country's agricultural
 infrastructure.
 Afghanistan lacks an independent judiciary to guarantee
 fundamental human rights. The most feared and consistent
 violator of human rights remains the secret police, formerly
 known as KHAD but renamed the Ministry of State Security in
 January 1986. Reportedly, more than 25,000 Afghans work full
 time within the Ministry under the close supervision of Soviet
 KGB "advisers." Many more Afghans are on the Ministry's
 payroll as informants. To accomplish its task of maintaining
 regime authority, the Ministry relies on intimidation,
 surveillance, imprisonment, interrogation, and torture.
 Under the Najibullah regime, the dismal human rights situation
 deteriorated still further in 1986. There is no prospect for
 an improvement in the human rights situation in Afghanistan
 without a political resolution that includes complete
 withdrawal of Soviet forces.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 Arbitrary killing and other acts of violence against suspected
 regime opponents were commonplace in 1986. On January 10 and
 13, Soviet aircraft carried out bombing raids against the town
 of Kohestan in Kapisa province and against Charikar, the
 capital of Parwan province. There were many civilian
 casualties in both locations, including 14 women and children
 killed in Charikar alone. Later that month, a Soviet-DRA force
 entered the village of Karch Laswari in Konarha province,
 seized several villagers suspected of collaborating with the
 mujahidin, and summarily executed them. On June 5-', Soviet
 forces bombed civilian targets near Sanglok in Wardak province,
 killing or wounding 20 civilians. As reprisals for mujahidin
 attacks in the Maidanshar area of Wardak, Soviet bombing raids
 in early August led to the deaths of approximately 50
 civilians. A similar reprisal raid in October against the
 village of Farza, 30 kilometers northwest of Kabul, resulted
 in 30 civilian deaths. The Soviets and/or the DRA also
 conducted such raids in June in the city of Herat, in July in
 the Logar valley, near the city of Paghman throughout
 September, and in the towns of Qarabagh, Shaka Dara, and
 Estalef and surrounding villages during October.
 The Soviets and the Kabul regime routinely execute captured
 resistance fighters on the battlefield. Occasionally, however,
 high-ranking captives are held for potential trades for Soviet
 prisoners. There are no known DRA prisoner- of-war detention
 facilities. The regime has claimed that captured mujahidin
 are not prisoners-of-war but rather "bandits."
 The regime continued in 1986 to execute political prisoners.
 The Kabul press carried occasional reports of death sentences
 meted out to alleged resistance fighters. Such reports
 included the sentencing to death, in their absence, of major
 resistance leaders and an April report of the "lynching" of
 two men who were accused of spreading false propaganda about
 the revolution. The report noted that the two had "met their
 deserved fate."
 
 
 1096
 AFGHANISTAN
 There are persistent reports that some mujahidin units have
 executed captured DRA military or party personnel. Although
 mujahidin units increasingly recognize the value of holding
 Soviet prisoners for public relations purposes or as a
 commodity to be traded later for captured comrades, general
 mujahidin field policy is apparently to kill rather than
 release those prisoners who burden their operations or
 jeopardize their security.
 Mujahidin assassination attempts against both party and
 government personnel and against Soviet military and civilian
 cadre are relatively common. Mujahidin attacks on Soviet and
 DRA posts have also resulted in the death and injury of
 innocent bystanders.
 b. Disappearance
 There were, as in the past, many disappearances in 1986. In
 most cases, family members learn eventually of the fate of
 persons who disappear from government-controlled cities. The
 unexplained disappearance of young males often means
 impressment into the armed forces. In other cases, Afghans
 are arrested and imprisoned or summarily executed for political
 offenses. Some persons disappear as a result of the actions
 'of the mujahidin, who sometimes abduct or capture regime
 personnel, military and civilian, and suspected government
 collaborators.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 To extract information, intimidate regime opponents, and punish
 suspected resistance sympathizers, the regime security services
 frequently rely on torture. This policy appears to have
 official sanction. As Amnesty International has noted in a
 November 1986 report on torture in Afghanistan, many of the
 testimonies available to it "refer to the presence of Soviet
 personnel when prisoners are being interrogated under torture."
 Physical or psychological abuse and intimidation remain the
 standard techniques. Such torture reportedly includes electric
 shock, beatings, banging heads against stone walls, deprivation
 of sleep, extraction of fingernails, burning of genitalia,
 hanging by the arms for extended periods, whipping, cutting
 -with knives, and pulling out of hair. There have been
 unconfirmed reports of the imposition by Islamic judges, in
 areas outside the regime's control, of extreme punishments such
 as stoning and mutilation.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 No constitutional or legal safeguards prevent arbitrary arrest
 or detention. Afghans in areas controlled by the regime face
 unwarranted seizure by security personnel. Detainees
 frequently are not told of the charges against them before
 trial, or in some cases are never brought to trial. Warrants
 are not used nor is the right to a judicial determination of
 the legality of detention respected. Some prisoners are held
 incommunicado for years with their families uncertain whether
 they are alive or dead. Although bail is occasionally granted,
 it is not a regular feature of Afghan law. Formal charges, if
 presented at all, may come only after months of interrogation.
 The mujahidin frequently seize and detain Soviet military and
 civilian personnel. Many remain prisoners, some are killed,
 and some join the mujahidin. Under a 1982 agreement, the
 
 
 1097
 AFGHANISTAN
 mujahidin have permitted the International Committee of the
 Red Cross (ICRC) limited access to its prisoners. The
 agreement also permitted the ICRC to take custody of a small
 number of Soviet prisoners being held by the resistance on the
 condition that they be interned in Switzerland for 2 years.
 Under the same agreement, the DRA was to permit ICRC access to
 resistance political prisoners in regime custody. The DRA
 failed to live up to its commitment, leading eventually to an
 ICRC decision to close its offices in Kabul. Continued ICRC
 negotiations with the DRA in 1986 appear to have produced no
 progress on the issue of ICRC access to prisoners.
 e, Denial of Fair Public Trial
 All courts, whether civil, military, "revolutionary," or
 security, are controlled by the PDPA. Laws governing their
 organization and jurisdiction establish as a first priority
 the protection of the "revolution." As a consequence,
 plaintiffs may be denied their legal rights because of charges
 regarding their political beliefs. Most persons accused of
 nonpolitical crimes are tried in the civil court system under
 the norms of pre-Communist judicial codes. Those political
 detainees who are charged and brought to trial are usually
 arraigned on allegations of treason, espionage, or terrorism
 and are tried and sentenced in secret. As a rule, they must
 provide their own defense without benefit of counsel. Death
 sentences generally are carried out quickly after a perfunctory
 review by the ruling Revolutionary Council. There is no
 mechanism to appeal a death sentence endorsed by the
 Revolutionary Council.
 In areas not controlled by the regime, civil and criminal
 cases are tried by Islamic judges (qazis) under Shari'a law
 and according to Afghan custom.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Afghan regime and the Soviet occupation forces do not
 recognize the right to privacy. Civilian areas are frequently
 cordoned off and subjected to search. Members of the secret
 police commonly accompany the military and check book titles
 and correspondence for evidence of unorthodox beliefs or
 antiregime connections. House-to-house searches are usually
 carried out in predawn hours. Telephones, at least in Kabul,
 are routinely tapped and correspondence monitored. Citizens
 are warned not to listen to foreign broadcasts except those
 from neutral countries or states friendly to the regime.
 In an interview with a Western correspondent in September, the
 Minister of Agriculture revealed a regime plan to relocate
 up to 30,000 families from the eastern provinces to new lands
 in the west. The plan, said to be voluntary, would be
 implemented over the next 10 years. However, the Minister's
 admission that "security concerns" would prompt the regime to
 move people from mujahidin-controlled areas called the plan's
 voluntary nature into question.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The regime and its Soviet backers consider the educational
 system and the mass media essential to their long-term
 objective of Sovietizing Afghan society and overturning
 
 
 1098
 AFGHANISTAN
 traditional Afghan social and political institutions. The
 regime tolerates no expression of ideas which have not been
 approved by the party and its Soviet ideological supervisors.
 Opposition viewpoints are suppressed, and criticism of the
 regime or the Soviets is swiftly punished. The regime employs
 censorship, surveillance, and oppression to ensure that all
 publicly expressed views hew to the party line. There is no
 academic freedom.
 All media are owned and controlled by the regime and tightly
 supervised by Soviet officials. The press, radio, and
 television are used to convey regime policy and the Soviet
 interpretation of world events. Soviet films and entertainment
 programs are frequently featured on Afghan television to
 reinforce that interpretation. The unlicensed import and sale
 of foreign video and audio tapes, magazines, books, posters,
 and other publications are forbidden. The great majority of
 new books on sale in Kabul, irrespective of language, are
 published in the U.S.S.R. Afghans are guarded in their private
 conversations, even among friends or colleagues, lest
 antiregime or anti-Soviet remarks be reported to the secret
 police. Western radio broadcasts in the local languages are
 regularly jammed, although some programs do get through to
 Afghan listeners and constitute one of their main sources of
 outside information.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 There is no freedom of peaceful assembly or association in
 areas controlled by the regime; only regime-sponsored and
 orchestrated assemblies are permitted. The regime stages
 "spontaneous" meetings to create the impression of popular
 support. Demonstrations at Western embassies are arranged on
 demand. All mass organizations are tightly controlled by the
 regime.
 Employees have been threatened with loss of jobs or
 imprisonment if they refuse to join party organizations. In
 some cases, families are warned that their children will be
 forced out of school if they do not join one of the official
 youth organizations. This campaign to restrict and channel
 political and social activities has encouraged the further
 exodus of the upper and middle classes.
 Labor has no right to organize in any meaningful fashion.
 Trade associations and unions of workers and of peasants are
 closely modeled after those of the Soviet Union and serve as
 vehicles for the Sovietization of Afghan society. The Central
 Committee of Afghan trade unions, with a claimed membership of
 150,000 workers, is an affiliate of the Communist-dominated
 World Federation of Trade Unions.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Afghanistan is an overwhelmingly Islamic nation, primarily
 Sunni. There are some Shi'a Muslims, particularly in the
 Hazarajat area of central Afghanistan. Traditionally, small
 urban enclaves of Hindus, Sikhs, and Jews have been tolerated.
 Since the 1978 coup, religious organizations have been tightly
 supervised. Major regime policies are promptly given the
 imprimatur of the Ministry of Religious Affairs. Wherever
 possible, the regime selects censors and pays mullahs for
 individual mosques. Afghans consider many of these clerics to
 be secret police agents. In the course of military operations
 
 
 1099
 AFGHANISTAN
 and sometimes in acts of reprisal against civilian communities,
 Soviet and DRA forces have damaged or destroyed mosques.
 Mosques in the Qarabagh area, north of Kabul, and at Chandal
 Ba'i, southwest of Paghman, were among those destroyed. The
 famous Friday mosque in Herat was damaged during the summer
 when the Soviets shelled parts of the city held by the
 mujahidin.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Domestic travel remains severely curtailed by the war.
 Surface travelers risk being caught in fights between
 mujahidin and Soviet forces. Buses and other vehicles are
 sometimes attacked by Soviet or regime helicopter gunships.
 The civilian traveler is also faced with frequent checkpoints
 or roadblocks set up by the Soviets, regime forces, mujahidin,
 and, in some cases, bandits. Tolls are often extracted. Air
 travel has become more hazardous because of occasional
 resistance attacks on aircraft and airports.
 The regime severely curtails foreign travel by Afghans under
 its control. Travel to the West is effectively discouraged
 and permission routinely denied for fear the traveler will not
 return. Some businessmen can still obtain passports, but many
 Afghans are forced to pay bribes of $1,000 or more for a
 passport. Bank accounts and real estate are often demanded as
 surety for return, and the regime is free to seize the property
 of persons absent for more than a year. Pilgrims to Mecca are
 carefully screened and are issued documents valid only for
 Saudi Arabia.
 Overland emigration is dangerous and for many prohibitively
 expensive. Families attempting to leave the country have been
 incarcerated, in some instances with their children. Soviet
 and DRA forces regularly target civilians attempting to flee
 to Pakistan or Iran. Despite the hazards and difficulties
 entailed, approximately 4 million Afghans have fled abroad
 since the Communist takeover in 1978. During 1986, "scorched
 earth" tactics by Soviet and DRA forces continued to be a
 major factor contributing to the mass exodus of refugees. The
 regime maintains that exiles are welcome to return without
 penalty if they agree to support the objectives of the
 "Revolution." It has not substantiated its claims that many
 refugees are returning to Afghanistan.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Afghanistan is a totalitarian state ostensibly ruled by Afghans
 and the PDPA but is in reality controlled by the Soviet Union.
 Citizens have no right to change their government. The PDPA
 is modeled closely on the Soviet Communist Party and is headed
 by a 14-member Politburo.    Soviet military and civilian
 advisers (the latter numbering approximately 9,000) sit in all
 ministries and make or approve all significant decisions.
 Membership in the PDPA is a prerequisite for meaningful
 participation in public affairs and professional advancement
 in most fields.
 
 
 1100
 AFGHANISTAN
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Kabul regime has resisted all efforts by international
 humanitarian organizations to investigate its human rights
 practices. During 1986 it refused to permit the International
 Committee of the Red Cross to monitor the conditions of, or
 have access to, mujahidin prisoners it holds, notwithstanding
 a 1982 agreement with the ICRC in which it undertook to permit
 access.
 The Soviets and the Kabul regime strongly opposed the renewed
 mandate given the Special Rapporteur on Human Rights in
 Afghanistan by the United Nations Human Rights Commission.
 They refused to cooperate with the Special Rapporteur's efforts
 and declared that they would not be bound by any of his
 findings. The regime also denounced the efforts of groups
 such as Amnesty International and Helsinki Watch.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 The participation of Afghan women in activities beyond the
 home and field is severely limited by traditional beliefs,
 customs, and religious practices. In areas under resistance
 control, the role of women follows traditional lines. The
 social position of some women, generally associated with the
 PDPA, has tended to improve in Kabul and other cities
 controlled by the regime. Access to education by younger
 women has increased and women have been placed in a number of
 nontraditional professions such as radio and television,
 banking, and the civil service. However, few women hold
 responsible decisionmaking positions. The vast majority of
 women under regime control have seen no improvement in their
 social position or status.
 CONDITIONS OF LABOR
 Due to the current situation in Afghanistan, information on
 the conditions of labor is not available.
