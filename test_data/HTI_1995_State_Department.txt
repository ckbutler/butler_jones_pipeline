 HAITI
 For the first full year in its history, Haiti was governed by a democratically elect-
 ed President. The Government brought an end to the massive, state-sanctioned
 human rights violations which had characterized the preceding 3 years. Although
 the 1991 coup d'etat which ousted President Jean-Bertrand Aristide after only 7
 months in office continued to affect the country's institutions even after his return,
 the Government-assisted by the international community-made significant
 progress in addressing many of the nation's most glaring systemic and institutional
 needs.
 Haiti's 1987 Constitution provides for a parliamentary democracy, but the Gov-
 ernment was unable to meet the constitutionally mandated schedule for legislative
 elections a month after Aristide's return. The Government thus operated without its
 legislative branch for much of the year. Nonetheless, the country was eventually
 able to hold peaceful elections for all of the nearly 2,100 parliamentary and local
 offices nationwide. President Aristide convoked the new National Assembly in Octo-
 ber. A presidential election was held on December 17, despite pressure from some
 popular organizations and influential individuals for Aristide (who was constitu-
 tionally barred from seeking a second consecutive term) to stay in office to "recover"
 his 3 years of exile. In the end, Rene Preval the candidate of the Lavalas platform
 defeated his 13 opponents with 88 percent of the vote. Preval took office on the con-
 stitutionally mandated date of February 7, 1996. The period of crisis from 1991-94
 also affected the judicial system, theoretically independent, but weak and corrupt
 after decades of governmental interference under the Duvaliers and subsequent gov-
 ernments. President Aristide and his Government began the task of rebuilding the
 justice s tem.
 The U.S.-led Multinational Force (MNF), which had entered Haiti peacefully in
 September 1994 under the authority of the United Nations Security Council, was
 replaced in March by the U.N. Mission in Haiti (UNMIH). Under its mandate,
 UMW.-I's approximately 6,000 peacekeeping troops and 900 civilian police were re-
 sponsible for assisting the Government to maintain a secure and stable environ-
 ment.
 Haiti continued its transition towards a constitutionally mandated national police
 force under civilian control, the Police Nationale d'Haiti (PNH). In revoking the
 commissions of the majority of members of the Haitian Armed Forces (FAd'H) at
 the beginning of 1995, President Aristide left in place those serving as part of the
 interim police. The newly established police academy, charged with training the ci-
 vilian police, enrolled its first class in January. The Ministry of Justice deployed
 these cadets at the beginning of June, and classes of cadets graduated each month
 thereafter, replacing members of the interim police on a one-for-one basis. In De-
 cember the Government issued a decree incorporating into the PNH the remaining
 members of the interim police, some 1,500 persons including both former FAd'H per-
 sonnel as well as interim police members who had been recruited from among Hai-
 tian migrants being held at the US. naval base at Guantanamo, Cuba. A small
 number of the ex-FAd- personnel were credibly implicated in human rights abuses.
 There were some incidents of arbitrary arrest and beating, as well as the killing of
 several suspects, by the interim police. The PNH gained a greater level of public
 confidence than the interim police had, but were often inclined to use excessive
 force, resulting in the beating and killing of several suspects. The authorities are
 investigating these incidents.Nonetheless, the PNHI bears little resemblance to the
 FAd'H, long an instrument of repression and violence.
 In eptember the UN/OAS International Civilian Mission (1CM) cited the "clear
 determination of the Government to improve the quality and performance of judicial
 officials, and to supervise the conduct of the new security agents," which had al-
 ready resulted in "a dramatic decrease in the number of complaints." There is much
 room for improvement, however, as the PNH continues to suffer from equipment
 problems, poor leadership, and political interference. President Aristide wanted the
 new Parliament to abolish the army, a remnant of which still exists in compliance
 
 
 with a constitutional mandate, but provisions do not allow amendment of the Con-
 stitution until the end of Parliaments 4-year term.
 Haiti is an extremely poor country. It has a market-based economy with state en-
 terprises controlling some sectors, such as telecommunications and energy. Two-
 thirds of the work force are employed in the agricultural sector, most in subsistence
 production. Although less than 1 percent of the work force is in the assembly sector,
 it is a major source of export revenue and added about 10,000 jobs in the last year.
 The country exports mangos, coffee, and sisal as well. Per capita gross domestic
 product increased 5 to 6 percent during 1995, but stands at only $260 annually.
 Most of the population subsists on substantially less than this, remaining in ex-
 treme poverty. Much of the country's wealth is still concentrated in the hands of
 a tiny, traditional elite.
 Haiti's human rights climate improved dramatically. The Aristide Government
 generally respected the human rights of its citizens, in stark contrast to the record
 of the military regime removed from power in 1994. In the past, widespread abuses
 such as judicial corruption, arbitrary arrest, prolonged detention of suspects, and ex-
 cessive use of force by the authorities, punctuated by short, dramatic periods of
 extrajudicial killings and other violent attacks with clear political motives, were
 common. The Aristide Government took great strides towards breaking this pattern,
 and such practices have become the object of sweeping Government reform efforts,
 although a buses still occur occasionally.
 Most troubling was the occurrence of more than 20 execution-style killings in
 which theft was apparently not a motive. Information including that developed by
 the USg. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in the investigation of one of these
 cases, the March 28 killing of Mireille Durcher Bertin, suggests that this killing
 was linked to several others and that persons associated with the Government may
 have been implicated in them. Near the end of the year, the Government estab-
 lished a Special Investigative Unit (SIU) comprising PNH investigators working
 under the direction of several magistratesto look into notorious homicides dating
 back to the mid-1980's. Little progress on other investigations had been made.
 The moribund judicial system was incapable of processing detainees in compliance
 with the law, and a large proportion of crimes including many which might have
 been politically motivated, remained unresolved. Improper arrests and warrantless
 searches, a clogged judicial docket, poor prison conditions, and vigiante activity con-
 doned by the authorities also contributed to ongoing human rights violations. Soci-
 etal discrimination against women and abuse of children are problems, most notably
 the widespread practice of rural families sending young children to the larger cities
 to work as unpaid domestics.
 The Government made limited headway in investting the murders of pr-
 Aristide activists and others which took p lace during the coup period. The President
 created the independent Presidential  ommission of Truth and Justice to inves-
 tigate and determine the extent of human rights abuses during the tenure of the
 de facto regime, but the Commission's mandate excluded scrutiny of human rights
 abuses which took place during Aristide's 7 months in office in 1991. The Presiden
 also established a committee in the Ministry of Justice to address several of the
 high profile killings of the same period, again, excluding examination of his own ear-
 lier tenure.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Persn, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-Political and extrajudicial killings by
 the authorities or security forces dropped dramatically with the return of the legiti-
 mate Government and its decision to dismantle virtually the entire pre-existing se-
 curity structure. Nevertheless, some people associated with the Government were
 implicated in execution-style killings. There were a number of cases in which the
 interim police or PNH killed suspects, over 100 instances of mob justice resulting
 in death, and several cases of suspected executions by vigante organizations, some
 of which appear to have been inspired by statements oAristide. The Government
 opened investigations into several high profile assassinations which took place dur-
 ing the coup period but by years end had not launched adequate investigations into
 the execution-style killings which occurred in 1995.
 In the last week of December 1994, three men were killed when military officers
 frned on dismissed FAd'H members who were rioting near the general headipuarters.
 There were several reports of suspects killed by the interim police, and in at least
 three cases, by the PNH. The interim police and PNH contend that the suspects
 were killed while attempting to escape.The PNHs Office of the Inspector Goneral
 (GIG) opened investigations into both these and other lesser P   incidents. By
 
 
 443
 year's end, the OIG had taken 12 disciplinary actions; 20 other investigations re-
 mained pending.
 With a generally ineffective interim police, a fledgling national police, and a na-
 tional focus on grassroots organizations, vigilante brigades made a renewed appear-
 ance. The 1CM expressed concern that an Aristide call in February for "community
 viglance" might have been misinterpreted by some Haitians to mean they could
 take the law mte their own hands. Although most of these served as neighborhood
 defense mechanisms, observers and international forces reported instances where
 they suspected vigilante groups were responsible for killings. In February a group
 of local gang members attacked the newly installed interim police contingent in
 Limbo and killed a lieutenant. Later in the year, however, vi ilante grups turned
 suspects over to the authorities.
 There was no evidence of national leadership of vigilante brigades, which were lo-
 calized phenomena, but such organizationsappeared in all nine provinces. Killings
 also resulted when mobs angered by a crime attacked the perpetrator immediately.
 For example, crowds in Port-au-Prince killed a man who had stabbed a woman in
 a taxi and two juveniles who had snatched a purse. Provincial citizens killed two
 men in September on suspicion of having used voodoo to cause the death of a newly
 elected deputy (the ICM believes the man died of AIDS). In November at least seven
 people were killed in violent clashes after Aristide, in an emotionally charged eulo-
 , encouraged citizens to assist the police in disarming perceived opponents of the
 vernment.
 In addition to incidents of summary justice and murders committed in connection
 with other crimes, there was a series of execution-style murders, about 20 according
 to an ICM press release in September, in which victims were either former members
 of the FAdHI (including a retired general and two retired colonels), attaches, mem-
 bers of the Revolutionary Front for the Advancement and Progress of Haiti
 (FRAPH-a notorious paramilitary organization during the 1993-94 period), persons
 connected to the petroleum or automotive industry, or persons whose affiliations
 were unknown. In these cases, robbery was apparently not the motive.
 One of the victims was a well-known attorney and former public prosecutor,
 Mireille Durocher Bertin who had been spokesperson for the former military re-
 gime. President Aristide had requested the FBI to investigate Bertin's murder, but
 government officials impeded the operation by failing to cooperate fully with the
 FBI. The FBI investigation produced evidence linking the Bertin case to several
 other killings, as well as information suggesting that government security officials
 may have been implicated in some of these deaths.
 Jean Hubert Feuille, a pro-Aristide member of Parliament and cousin of the Presi-
 dent, was killed in a November shooting. A substantial sum of money was taken
 by the perpetrators, and theft may have been the motivation. Feuille's colleague, a
 parliamentarian from the same party, survived the attack and claimed publicly that
 it was the work of unnamed presidential advisers allegedly angered that he was at-
 tempting to expose their corruption.
 In October, in response to domestic and international pressure to solve the recent
 execution-style killings, the Government announced the creation of the SIU to inves-
 tigate certain high profile killings which had taken place since the mid-1980s. The
 SIU, which comprises a group of PNH investigators under the direction of a mag-
 istrate, was tasked with the investigation of over 70 such cases, the majority of
 which occurred during the period of military rule following President Aristide's over-
 throw in September 1991.
 President Aristide regularly and emphatically stressed the need for both reconcili-
 ation and justice following the re ression and human rights trauma of the prior 3
 years. To his end, he created a Pesidential Commission of Truth and Justice and
 a special lawyers' committee to investigate four high profile murders during the
 coup period: those of Antoine Izmery, Guy Malary, JeanMarie Vincent, and Claudy
 Musseau.
 The Government began investigations into the killings during the coup period of
 these four well-known Aristide supporters. One suspect was tried and convicted in
 the case of the assassination of Antoine Izmery. Also in the Izmery murder, a court
 found guilty in absentia several members and supporters of the Cedras regime, in-
 cluding former chief of police Michel Francois, the former captain of the police inves-
 tigative service, known for its brutality, and the second in command of FRAPH.
 However, the cases of Guy Malary, Jean Marie Vincent, and Clady Musseau re-
 main unsolved. Haitian authorities requested the deportation of Emmanuel Con-
 stant, the founder of FRAPH, who had escaped to the United States in December
 1994. Constant appealed the initial deportation order entered against him. At the
 end of the year, he remained in US. custody.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 
 
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The 1987 Constitution prohibits unnecessary force or restraint, psychological pres-
 sure, or physical brutality. After years of systematic abuse under prior regimes, the
 legitimate authoritieslargely respected these constitutional protections in 1995.
 There were several reports of police beating suspects or detainees. In at least one
 case, a local "casec" (rural section council member) allegedly authorized the plaintiff
 to beat the defendant. In an incident in June, prison guards at Fort National beat
 approximately 12juveniles after the young men attacked a guard. However, there
 were no reports of the use of rape as a means of torture and intimidation, a practice
 which was widely reported under the military regime.
 Records of the Human Rights Fund, a US. Government project to assist victims
 of human rights abuses, highlight the vast improvement in treatment by authori-
 ties: in the 3 months beforersident Aristide's return, it assisted 49 acute trauma
 victims, provided over 3,000 medical consultations, and gave psychological counsel-
 ing to nearly 100 people. In early 1995, the relief portion of the fund was terminated
 due to a lack of new cases.
 Prisoners and detainees, held in overcrowded and inadequate facilities, continued
 to suffer from a lack of the most basic hygiene facilities as well as from inadequate
 food and health care, including necessary medical treatment. Prisoners and detain-
 ees had to rely on family or friends for food and medicine. At the National Peniten-
 tiary in Port-au-Prince, nine prisoners died from malnutrition in a 2-week period
 at the end of the year.
 The Government, with the assistance of the international community, began to
 address prison inadequacies. The President implemented legislation creating the
 National Penitentiary Administration (APENA), Haiti's first civilian prison adminis-
 tration. APENA, which includes a corps of prison guards, has posted agents at 13
 of the country's 15 prisons, including at least 1 female prison guard at each facility
 to address the needs of female prisoners. To accommodate women and juveniles pre-
 viously held in close quarters with the adult male prisoners in the National Peniten-
 tiary, the Ministry of Justice refurbished a former military facility in Port-au-
 Princeto serve as a prison for them. The Government, with help from the Inter-
 national Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and other donors, made some initial
 efforts to refurbish the National Penitentiary, which housed approximately 60 per-
 cent of the prison population, by restoring some burned-out cell blocks, improving
 kitchen facilities, reopening previously unusable latrines and showers, and restoring
 prisoner access to unused courtyard space. Nonetheless, overcrowding at the Na-
 tional Penitentiary had become an acute problem by the end of the year.
 Authorities permit the ICRC, the Haitian Red Cross, the ICM, and other human
 rights groups to enter prisons, monitor conditions, and assist prisoners with medical
 care, food, and legal aid.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution stipulates that a person
 may be arrested only if apprehended during the commission of a crime, or if a judi-
 cial warrant has been issued. The authorities must bring the detainee before a judge
 within 48 hours of arrest.
 There were no reported cases of the previously common practice of secret deten-
 tion. The number of arbitrary arrests decreased significantly. Some occurred in con-
 nection with land disputes in Artibonite province. In another instance, a justice of
 the peace arrested the brother of someone accused of wounding a third party, when
 the alleged culprit went into hiding. There were also some cases in which authori-
 ties made arrests based on flawed warrants, including illegal group warrants and
 those based on verbal denunciations; or on documents which were essentially sub-
 poenas, not arrest warrants. Some arrests were also made in the presence of a jus-
 tice of the peace without a warrant, which is legally insufficient. For example, in
 early March, the Minister of Justice named a new state prosecutor for Port-au-
 Prince, who promptly issued a warrant for 12 people on the grounds of plotting
 against the Government. The interim police subsequently arrested two men listed,
 Dieumaitre Lucas and Patrick Bastien, and authorities released the men only after
 holding them illegally for 6 months. Police detained a prominent opposition politi-
 cian, Duly Brutus, in July, using a warrant which gave authority only to bring him
 in for questioning. Police also arrested Carl Denis, a well-known anti-Aristide activ-
 ist, based on a denunciation by an organization of former soldiers. Colonel (ret.)
 Christophe Dardompre was arrested in November without a warrant; he remained
 in detention at the end of the year even though a judge had ordered his release.
 At the beginning of 1995, detainees who had never seena dge or whose cases
 stagnated in the legal system crowded the prisons, particularly the National Peni-
 tentiary. The Miistr of Justice made a sincere effort to correct this failure, assign-
 ing judges to "triage the cases, and releasing those who had already served more
 time in detention than they would have served if sentenced for the crime in ques-
 
 
 445
 tion. In the absence of any system of public defenders, the Ministry also established
 a project by which law students assisted detainees to prepare their cases. During
 the fi-st month of the triage program (Augst), participants reviewed the cases of
 559 detainees, resulting in 7 being brought to trial and convicted, and 85 being
 freed by justices of the peace. Nevertheless, an overburdened, often corrupt, and in-
 adequate judicial system regularly detained suspects well beyond the 48 hours per-
 mitted for arraignment. Cases bound over to higher courts also continued to lan-
 guish. In September 87 percent of the inmates in the National Penitentiary were
 in pretrial detention.
 The Constitution prohibits involuntary exile of citizens. While some have left the
 country voluntarily for personal or political reasons, the Government did not make
 use of exile as punishment. Most senior FACI' officers chose voluntary exile, many
 departing due to fear for their safety after several former officers were murdered.
 In November former military strongman Prosper Avril took asylum in the Colom-
 bian Embassy after the police illegally raided his home and arrested his daughter
 and son-in-law; at the end of the year, the Government had not allowed Avril safe
 passage out of the country.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution provides for an independent judi-
 ciary and the right to a fair public trial. However, the former is virtually nonexist-
 ent, and the latter is widely abridged. Two hundred years of rampant corruption
 and governmental neglect have left the judicial system poorly organized and vir-
 tually moribund. Under these circumstances, citizens often do not bring criminal
 cases to the police or judicial authorities, and most crimes go unprosecuted.
 The Constitution vests judicial power in a supreme court, courts of appeal, courts
 of first instance and courts of peace. Court proceedings are generally public but may
 take place in closed session in the interest of public order. In cases of political of-
 fenses or offenses involving the press, sentences must be delivered in open session.
 Examining magistrates known as juges d'instruction try cases in the courts of first
 instance. Commisaires or public prosecutors supervise the Judicial Police, which in-
 vestigate crimes, gather evidence, and deliver suspects to the courts.
 Under Haiti's criminal justice system, all legal proceedings begin with either an
 official inquiry by a member of the Judicial Police or with a recorded denunciation
 known as a proces verbal. A legal arrest may follow a police report accompanied by
 a proces verbal; a citizen's complaint, whether or not accompanied by a proces
 verbal; or when a perpetrator is caught in a criminal act.
 The Government has acknowledged that judicial reform is critical, and has
 worked with the international community to address some of the problems plaguing
 the system, including understaffing, untrained and incompetent staff, and mad-
 equate compensation. In July the Ministry of Justice opened the constitutionally
 mandated magistrates' school. During its first 3 months, the school put over 100
 judges and prosecutors through intensive 2-week training courses, and will continue
 to focus on short and long term training for justices of the peace and trial judges.
 Some human rights organizations complain, however, that corrupt judges from the
 coup period continue on the bench and that many are irredeemable.
 The Constitution expressly denies police and judicial authorities the right to inter-
 rogate persons charged with a crime unless the suspect has legal counsel present
 or waives this right. Nevertheless, not all accused can afford counsel and the law
 does not require that the Government provide legal representation; interrogation
 without counsel present continues to occur frequently. Under the Code of Criminal
 Procedure, responsibility to investigate crimes is unclear and authority to prosecute
 is divided among police, prosecutors, and investigating magistrates. The Code stipu-
 lates two criminal court sessions per year, each lasting 2 weeks, to try all major
 crimes requiring a jury trial. Failure to reform this aspect of the Code has contrib-
 uted to a huge backlog of cases inherited from years past, with some detainees hav-
 ing waited years in pretrial detention for a court date. In addition, for the last sev-
 eral years, the Ministry of Justice held only one assize in Port-au-Prince, and there
 were districts in which it held no assize at all. However there were some improve-
 ments, as assizes took place in several districts, and the Minister of Justice commit-
 ted himself to a second session in Port-au-Prince in December. During its August
 session, the assizes in Port-au-Prince ruled on 12 cases, while those in Lea Cayes
 handed down decisions in 10. If the accused is ultimately tried and found innocent,
 he has no recourse against the Government for time already served.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution prohibits such practices, and government authorities generally re-
 spected these prohibitions. In November, however, the Government ordered the po-
 lice to carry out a number of warrantless searches of private residences as part of
 
 
 446
 an effort to search for weapons. Most of these searches took place in middle-class
 and wealthy neighborhoods and more frequently in the cities than in rural areas.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech
 and the press, and the Government generally respects these rights in practice.The
 press energetically exercised this freedom, with the print media often openly critical
 of the Government (from both the left and the right ends of the political spectrum).
 There are two independent dailies in Port-au-Prince, as well as a journal published
 by Tilegliz, a Catholic group associated with liberation theology. Foreign-based pro-
 and anti-Aristide newspapers circulate in Haiti as well. All freely published reports
 on negative reactions by Haitians and others on the elections, security, violence, the
 efforts to abolish the army, the economy, and other political issues. Foreign journal-
 ists circulated throughout the country without hindrance. There were no reports of
 censorship, nor did there appear to be self-censorship, except in the case of an elec-
 toral debate which the government television station edited, in contravention of the
 agreement between its organizer, the National Democratic Institute, and the sta-
 tion. The station subsequently rebroadcast the debate in its entirety.
 With an illiteracy rate of approximately 80 percent, broadcast media, especially
 Creole-language radio, have unusual importance. Thirty-two radio stations operate
 in Port-au-Prince, 17 of which offer news programming. There is one government-
 owned radio and television station. These totals represent a significant increase in
 the number of stations that were operating during the 1991-94 period. Broadcast
 media tended to be neutral or supportive of the Government.
 There was a handful of confrontations between authorities and the media. In
 March presidential security agents manhandled journalists trying to film the agents
 arresting and allegedly beating a man who had climbed the wall of the National
 Palace. Thirty journalists subsequently boycotted coverage of events at the Palace,
 until the President met with them to hear their concerns. In June authorities in
 Les Cayes closed a local radio station after it broadcast a freewheeling political dis-
 cussion. They based their action on the fact that its license was still pending, the
 journalists who moderated the event were summoned for questioning, but were not
 detained. The station was subsequently allowed to resume broadcasting. In August
 the Minister of Information closed the daily government newspaper L'Union for
 "renovation," after public disagreements with the editor.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-Authorities respected the con-
 stitutional rights of freedom of assembly and association, after years of restriction.
 Political parties across the spectrum were able to meet, recruit members and can-
 didates, and hold election rallies for their partisans. Nongovernmental organizations
 and grassroots and popular groups, many of which had had to suspend their activi-
 ties under threat from the military regime and its agents or go underground,
 emerged from hiding and resumed their activities. New organizations also formed,
 including one dedicated to the rights of former soldiers.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for the right to practice all re-
 ligions and faiths, provided that practice does not disturb law and order. President
 Aristide met officially not only with Catholic religious officials but with Protestants
 and Vauduisants (adherents of vaudoun or voodoo, a mix of African religions and
 Catholicism) as well. There are currently no government restrictions on missionary
 activities, affiliation with overseas coreligionists, or religious instruction or publish-
 ing.
 In contrast to numerous incidents during the previous regime, there were no re-
 ports of attacks against religious figures.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-There are no legal restrictions on the movement of citizens within the
 country.
 An unknown number of undocumented migrants put to sea seeking better eco-
 nomic opportunities in other countries. The US. Coast Guard interdicted and re-
 turned approximately 1,800. Hundreds of others succeeded in landing illegally in
 the Bahamas, the Turks and Caicos Islands, or Florida, while several drowned. The
 Government created a National Migration Office to assist repatriates. It also
 reached an agreement with the Bahamas for repatriating Haitians who lacked legal
 status there.
 There have been no cases of asylum seekers or refugees in Haiti, and, accordingly,
 the Government has not formulated a policy to deal with the question of refugees.

 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change their Govern-
 ment
 The Constitution provides for regular elections for local and parliamentary offices
 and for the presidency. Legislative elections scheduled for November 1994, but de-
 layed because President Aristide did not return until October of that year, took
 place over three rounds in June, August, and September. The Presidential election
 scheduled under the Constitution for the end of November was held successfully on
 December 17.
 The terms of all members of the 83-member Chamber of Deputies, the lower
 house of the Parliament, and of two-thirds of the 27-member Senate, expired on
 February 4, as did the mandates of all local government officials. The Parliament
 ended its deliberations on that date resulting in a legislative void. President
 Aristide, however, appointed mayors throughout the country to manage local gov-
 ernment. Most of these were incumbents, but critics of the President accused him
 of replacing members of opposition political parties with his own adherents.
 A provisional electoral council (CEP), created by a political compromise in late
 1994, administered the legislative and municipal elections, which filled the vacant
 seats of 101 of 110 parliamentarians and 2,094 local government officials. CEP in-
 competence marked the period preceding the Parliamentary elections, and wide-
 spread logistical problems, poor administration of the voting and counting process,
 and isolated cases of violence and intimidation marred the first round, resulting in
 anger and an eventual boycott of the second round by most opposition political par-
 ties. However, most international observers called the election a significant step for-
 ward, and agreed that the serious flaws which existed had not altered the election's
 outcome. After a major change of CEP leadership, it was able to correct many irreg-
 ularities before holding runoffs and restaging about 20 percent of the first round
 contests. It also agreed to reimburse a portion of the candidates' registration fees
 and campaign expenses, although this in fact never occurred.
 As the date for the presidential election neared, many of President Aristide's sup-
 porters urged him to postpone the election for 3 years to make up for the period
 he was in exile. Ambiguity over this issue clouded the process through election day.
 The December 17 election, in which 14 candidates competed, was deemed by inter-
 national electoral observers to be free, fair, and peaceful, with the CEP showing fur-
 ther marked improvement in the administration of the election. Turnout for the
 election nationwide was 28 percent. Rene Preval of the Lavalas platform won an ab-
 solute majority and was inaugurated as President on the constitutionally mandated
 date of February 7, 1996.
 There are no de jure impediments to women's participation in politics or govern-
 ment. The generally lower status of women, however, limits their role in these
 fields. Of the 83 members in the Chamber of Deputies, only 3 are women, and there
 are no women in the 27-member Senate. President Aristide named several women
 to prominent positions in his Government including a foreign minister (who was
 later elevated to prime minister), a finance minister, and the head of the Presi-
 dential Commission of Truth and Justice and has relied on female advisors on his
 palace staff.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 About a dozen local human rights groups exist in Haiti. Most have continued to
 monitor conditions in the country, with particular emphasis on the activities of
 former members of the armed forces attaches section chiefs, and members of the
 notorious paramilitary group FRAPA. Some have changed their focus, at least in
 part, to issues of justice an  civic education, as the numbers of violations decreased
 drastically with the return of the constitutionally elected Government.
 Many of the local groups worked with the Presidential Commissionof Truth and
 Justice formally established in late March. The Commission had a 9-month mandate
 to take complaints and investigate the human rights tragedy of 1991-94 in order
 to determine what kinds of abuses occurred and their magnitude. It gathered testi-
 mony throughout the country, and accepted written records compiled by human
 rights groups during the 3-year crisis. The Commission completed the investigatory
 phase of its work in December and was expected to release its final report in early
 1996.
 The International Civilian Mission, operated jointly by the United Nations (U.N.)
 and the Organization of American States (OAS), investigated reports of human
 rights violations, assisted in monitoring the elections, and issued periodic reports
 and press releases. Representatives of international human rights organizations vis-
 ited Haiti from time to time. During the General Assembly of the OAS in June, del-
 egates elected the Haitian Minister of Justice to a seat on the Inter-American Corn-
 
 
 448
 mission on Human Rights, beginning in 1996. The ICRC was active throughout the
 year, particularly in the area of prison renovation and assistance to prisoners. The
 authorities allowed the ICRC and the ICM free access to prisoners. The National
 Coalition for Haitian Refugees also maintained a presence.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The 1987 Constitution does not specifically prohibit discrimination on the grounds
 of race, sex, religion, disability, language, or social status. It does, however, provide
 for freedom of religion and equal working conditions regardless of sex, beliefs, or
 marital status. There is no effective governmental mechanism to administer or en-
 force these provisions.
 Women.-Knowledgeable local authorities report that both criminal and domestic
 violence, including rape, occur but are rarely reported or prosecuted. Most of this
 violence goes unreported, and authorities have been ineffectual in prosecuting com-
 plaints (see Section i.e.).
 Although women are often the breadwinners for poor families, they do not enjoy
 the same economic and social status as men. In some social strata, tradition limits
 women's roles; peasant women, for example, remain largely in the traditional occu-
 pations of farming, marketing, and domestic tasks. Poorer families sometimes ration
 education money to pay school fees for male children only. Nonetheless, women have
 occupied prominent positions in both the public and private sectors in recent years.
 Children.-The Parliament ratified, at the end of December 1994, the Inter-
 national Convention on the Rights of the Child, and the President signed the bill
 2 weeks later. The Government expressed public concern over the plight of children
 and welcomed international assistance for them. It did not have the resources, how-
 ever, to implement effective mechanisms for their protection.
 Rural families continued to send young children to serve as unpaid domestic labor
 for more affluent city dwellers. The use of children in this manner is not limited
 to the wealthy class; middle and lower class families also follow the practice, called
 "restavek". The Government has not enacted any legislation to curb this abuse. A
 1991 U.N. study cited the restavek children as an example of slavery practiced in
 the 20th century. The Government does not compile official statistics, but observers
 estimate that-due to greater internal displacement during the period of illegal mili-
 tary. rule-the number of restaveks now far exceeds the 109,000 reported by the
 U.N. in 1991. The Ministry of Social Affairs believes that as many as 20 percent
 of restaveks are mistreated. Employers compel the children to work long hours, pro-
 vide them with little nourishment, and frequently beat and sexually abuse them.
 Port-au-Prince's large population of street children includes runaway restaveks, as
 well as children orphaned or separated from their families. The abysmal state of the
 economy only worsens the plight of such children, whom society holds in little re-
 gard. Local human rights groups do not view the plight of restavek children as a
 priority and do not report on abuses of children or actively seek to improve their
 situation. The Government's efforts to deal with restaveks have centered on mon-
 itoring some of the children working as domestics and intervening to move them to
 other homes if they are being mistreated. The Government does not take any action
 against abusive employers.
 People With Disabilities.-The Constitution provides that disabled persons shall
 have the means to assure their autonomy, education, and independence. Despite the
 constitutional provision for means of autonomy for the disabled, there is no enacting
 legislation mandating provision of access for people with disabilities. There is no
 overt ill-treatment of people with disabilities, but given the desperate poverty in
 which the vast majority of Haitians live, those with disabilities face a particularly
 harsh existence.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-Some 99 percent of Haitians are descend-
 ants, in whole or in part, of African slaves who won their war of independence from
 France in 1804. The remaining population is of European, Middle Eastern, North
 American, or Latin American origin. The law makes no distinctions based on race.
 There are longstanding social and political animosities among Haitians, however,
 often tied to cultural identification and skin color, and issues of class, in this starkly
 inegalitarian society. Some of these animosities date back to before Haiti's revolu-
 tionary period.
 There are two official languages: Creole, which is spoken by virtually all Haitians,
 and French, which is spoken by about 20 percent of the population. The inability
 to read, write, and speak French, or read and write Creole, has long limited the po-
 litical and economic opportunities available to the majority of the population. In the
 past, the country's French-speaking elite effectively used language requirements as
 
 
 449
 an additional barrier to the advancement of the country's Creole-speaking majority.
 However, Creole use in political discourse increased dramatically in 1995.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution and the Labor Code provide for the
 right of association and provide workers, including those in the public sector, the
 right to form and join unions without prior government authorization. Although
 union activities are protected, the law prohibits a closed shop. The law requires a
 union, which must have a minimum of 10 members, to register with the Ministry
 of Social Affairs within 60 days of its establishment. Union membership is estimated
 at 5 percent of the total labor force. There are six principal labor federations, each
 of which maintains some fraternal relations with various international labor organi-
 zations.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The Labor Code protects
 trade union organizing activities and stipulates flnes for those who interfere with
 this right. After years of having their activities curtailed by the authorities, the
 unions are now free in fact as well as in law to pursue their goals. Nonetheless,
 the high unemployment rate has had a profoundly damaging impact on union activi-
 ties. In addition, militant union activity between 1987 and 1991 led to the closure
 of some industrial firms, making many factory workers antiunion. Organized labor
 activity is generally concentrated in the Port-au-Prince area, primarily in the assem-
 bly sector, and in state enterprises. Observers estimate that only 2 to 3 percent of
 the industrial labor force is unionized. Many union activists militantly oppose pri-
 vatization of state enterprises, fearing the effect on employment and union member-
 ship.
 Collective bargaining, which has never been widespread, was nonexistent in 1995.
 Employers generally set wages unilaterally.
 There are no export processing zones. Prior to 1991 and the imposition of the OAS
 trade embargo, Haiti did have a sizable export-oriented assembly sector. The Labor
 Code does not distinguish between industries producing for the local market and
 those producing for export. Many assembly sector companies were the focus of devel-
 opmental efforts; they received greater outside scrutiny and were consequently
 somewhat more generous with benefits and wages. Employment in the export as-
 sembly sector, however, declined from almost 35,000 jobs in September 1991 to
 fewer than 1,000 in September 1994, before rebounding in the subsequent 12
 months to about 10,000. As the assembly sector contracted, unions that were par-
 ticularly strong in this sector declined accordingly.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Labor Code prohibits forced
 or compulsory labor, but enforcement of these provisions is practically nonexistent.
 Children continued to be subjected to forced domestic labor (see Section 5).
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The minimum employment age for
 minors in all sectors is 15 years. Fierce adult competition for jobs ensures that child
 labor is not a factor in the industrial sector. Children under age 15 commonly work
 at odd jobs in both rural and urban settings to supplement family income. Enforce-
 ment of child labor laws is the responsibility of the Ministry of Social Affairs, but
 the International Labor Organization has criticized the Ministry's enforcement as
 inadequate.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-President Aristide raised the minimum daily
 wage, which applies to industrial, commercial, and agricultural workers, from $1.00
 (15 gourdes) to $2.40 (36 gourdes) effective June 1. While sufficient to support a sin-
 gle worker, the minimum wage cannot adequately support additional family mem-
 bers. Although they are considerably better off than the rest of the population, most
 minimum wage earners live in slum conditions. In addition the majority of Haitians
 work in subsistence agriculture where minimum wage legislation does not apply.
 The Labor Code governs individual employment contracts. The Code sets the nor-
 mal workday at 8 hours and the workweek at 48 hours with 24 hours of rest on
 Sunday. It also establishes minimum health and safety regulations. The industrial
 sector, which is concentrated in the Port-au-Prince area and more accessible to out-
 side scrutiny, observes these laws and regulations in practice. However, the Min-
 istry of Social Affairs has inadequate resources to enforce work hours and Labor
 Code provisions on health and safety. With more than 50 percent of the population
 unemployed, workers are not able to exercise the right to remove themselves from
 dangerous work situations without jeopardy to continued employment.
