 NAMIBIA
 Nimibia is a political anomaly, and its unique status
 significantly affects the human rights situation in the
 territory. Formerly German South*West Africa, Namibia has
 been ruled by the Republic of South Africa since 1915. The
 United Nations lifted South Africa's 1920 League of Nations
 mandate in 1966. However, South Africa refused to relinquish
 the territory and ignored a 1971 advisory opinion of the
 International Court of Justice upholding U.N. authority over
 Namibia and calling for South Africa's immediate withdrawal.
 Although the South African Government's representative in
 Windhoek, the Administrator General, continues to "administer"
 Namibia, South Africa over the years has created several
 structures to which it has devolved some autonomy over internal
 affairs. (South Africa retains direct responsibility for
 foreign affairs, defense, and the territory's constitutional
 status.) The most recent structure created, the Transitional
 Government of National Unity (TG), has been serving since June
 1985. A number of political groups refused to join the TG,
 including the South West African People's Organization (SWAPO),
 the largest and most important group opposing South Africa and
 the TG. The international community does not recognize the TG
 and holds the South African Government responsible for the
 actions of the Namibian authorities.
 In 1978 the United States, the United Kingdom, France, the
 Federal Republic of Germany, and Canada drafted a proposal for
 Namibian independence agreed to in talks with South Africa,
 SWAPO, and the neighboring states (known as the "Front Line
 States"). This proposal was adopted by the United Nations
 Security Council as UNSCR 435. It calls for a cease-fire, the
 phased withdrawal of South African forces, and free elections
 under U.N. supervision. South Africa has said it will
 implement UNSCR 435 only with a satisfactory commitment by the
 Angolan Government on the parallel withdrawal of Cuban troops
 from Angola. The United States, Angola, and South Africa have
 held periodic talks on a timetable for Cuban troop withdrawal
 and, in past years, the Angolan and South African Governments
 have made formal proposals on the numbers and timing of that
 withdrawal. The United States held talks with Angolan
 officials in April, July, and September 1987 on this issue.
 Meanwhile, Namibia continues to experience low-level guerrilla
 conflict with insurgents of SWAPO's military branch, the
 People's Liberation Army of Namibia (PLAN), fighting the South
 African Defense Forces (SADF), and Namibia's South-West Africa
 Territorial Force (SWATF). SWAPO draws its strength
 principally from within the Ovambo tribe. The bulk of the
 insurgency and counterinsurgency effort occurs in the north in
 Ovamboland and Kavango, but violence erupts sporadically
 throughout the country. Guerrilla activity by PLAN diminished
 in 1987 in the face of effective South African operations.
 SWAPO, whose external political and military wings are based
 in Luanda, Angola, also has a policical wing which is allowed
 to operate, inside Namibia.
 Some 60 percent of the population of 1.3 million lives by
 subsistence agriculture. The modern economy relies on mining
 (which employs at least 10 percent of the work force), fishing,
 ranching, and food processing. Gross domestic product grew by
 3.5 percent in 1986 and was expected to grow by about 2.5
 percent in 1987, according to government statistics. However,
 the relative lack of diversification in the economy has
 produced uneven growth. Economic conditions are particularly
 
 
 206
 NAMIBIA
 severe in the north. Overall the Transitional Government
 estimated unemployment to be 15 percent in 1986.
 In 1987, as over the past 20 years, most reports of human
 rights violations by government authorities or SWAPO involved
 actions taken in the "operational area" in northern Namibia
 (where over half of the territory's population lives) and
 during South African raids into southern Angola. Arbitrary
 government detention without access to counsel or visits by
 family members as well as otner restrictions, e.g., on freedom
 of assembly, continued. During 1987 the TG's Constitutional
 Council grappled with the drafting of a constitution. A
 majority of the Council's members accepted a draft that would
 effectively end ethnic-based government, but the South African
 Government said the draft did not provide adequate guarantees
 for group or minority rights. In a move interpreted by some
 as a sign of displeasure over the majority draft constitution,
 the South African Government cut its subsidy to Namibia by
 $100 million.
 RESPECT FOR HUI-AN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 Namibia remains an arena of guerrilla conflict, and in the
 course of operations there are periodic reports of politically
 motivated attacks and killing by both government security
 forces and SWAPO (see Section l.g.). The SADF/SWATF claim
 SWAPO guerrillas have murdered some civilians of the dominant
 Ovambo tribe in the northern operational area, allegedly to
 intimidate others into supporting SWAPO or at least refraining
 from helping the security forces.
 There are regular and numerous reports of abuses, including
 killings, by an internal police counterinsurgency force
 formerly known as "Koevoet" ("Crowbar"), and now known as
 "Coin" (short for "counterinsurgency"). In the most prominent
 case, six security force members were charged in September
 with murder in the killing of SWAPO member Immanuel Shifidi
 during a SWAPO rally in November 1986. The trial was
 continuing at the end of 1987.
 b. Disappearance
 Under security legislation, security forces need not notify
 anyone when a person is detained, and they often hold
 detainees incommunicado for extended periods of time. As a
 result, some Namibians have "disappeared" only to turn up
 later in detention cells. As in previous years, there were
 reports in 1987 that security force officials failed to
 respond to requests from family members for information. In
 such cases, legal counsel sometimes has to petition the courts
 to obtain information on suspected detainees. Amnesty
 International (AI), in its 1987 Report (covering 1986), noted
 that the van Dyck Commission (see Section i.e.) had determined
 that the security police had not kept records on detainees
 under security law AG-9. Al stressed that this failure to
 keep records may explain why in previous years the authorities
 were unable to account for people whose relatives believed
 they had been detained.
 
 
 207
 NAMIBIA
 In 1987 there was a continuing controversy over what has
 happened to approximately 100 SWAPO members. One Namibian
 group, the Parents Committee, and the International Society
 for Human Rights claimed that SWAPO had itself killed several
 of these persons and was holding the remainder against their
 will. SWAPO claimed that the persons concerned were "spies"
 and were being held in camps in Angola and Zambia. These
 "disappearances" also may be related to the SWATF claims that
 SWAPO kidnaps civilians, particularly young people, to gain
 recruits. SWATF claimed in June that SWAPO had abducted 89
 people, including 73 children, in the previous 2 weeks. Eight
 of the 73 children reportedly "escaped." SWAPO consistently
 has denied claims of kidnaping, saying that its recruits come
 voluntarily.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Allegations of abuses by security forces, particularly
 Koevoet, continued in 1987. As in earlier years, political
 leaders, clergymen, and others regularly made detailed
 allegations that the police and security forces engaged in
 brutal treatment,:including severe beatings, of civilians,
 primarily in northern Namibia, in and out of detention. Some
 of these allegations have been confirmed, either through
 admissions by security force personnel or through
 investigations. The Transitional Government's Minister of
 Justice stated publicly that the TG should not be held
 responsible for policd or Defense Force atrocities, as it does
 not control these forces.
 The authorities have investigated some, but not all, cases of
 alleged misbehavior by security forces. In a few cases,
 investigations were spurred by defense attorneys' threats to
 institute what are known as "private prosecutions" of security
 officials. In a 1987 case, a South African police captain,
 Pat King, stood trial for the torture of several Ovambo
 citizens and the killing of one of them, Johannes Kakuva, in
 1980. King was acquitted in December 1987. In another case,
 a Koevoet captain admitted during a trial of eight suspected
 SWAPO insurgents that helhad beaten one of the accused in
 order to force a confession. The confession was excluded as
 evidence, but the victim nevertheless was convicted of
 terrorism. Upon the judge's recommendation, two officers
 involved in the interrogation of Johnny Heita and seven others
 were investigated for their conduct. However, the Government
 decided in November not to prosecute. The SADF has stated
 that during 1985 and 1986, 29 SADF members were tried,
 convicted, and sentenced in the Windhoek Supreme Court to
 terms ranging up to 22 years in prison.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, Exile, or Forced Labor
 The Government employs three pieces of security legislation
 granting broad powers of detention. In contrast to previous
 years, in 1987 the Government relied primarily on Section 6 of
 the Terrorism Act of 1967 to detain suspected insurgents or
 SWAPO sympathizers. This Act, repealed in South Africa but
 continuing in force in Namibia, is the harshest of the three
 laws, allowing for indefinite incommunicado detention without
 review. Under the Act, the detainee frequently is held in
 solitary confinement and does not have access to counsel, his
 own physician, family, or friends. He does, however, have
 access to government-appointed doctors and magistrates. The
 other two laws, enacted by proclamations of the Administrator
 
 
 208
 NAMIBIA
 General and also providing for detention without trial, are
 known as AG-9 and AG-26. The former, which heretofore
 constituted the legal basis for most detentions, allows for
 access to counsel only after 30 days; the latter allows for
 early access.
 It is not certain how many people were in detention during
 1987. In a response to a parliamentary question in June,
 South African President Botha stated that there were a total
 of 10 Namibians in detention without trial under the three
 security laws; 9 under the Terrorism Act. But the TG's
 Minister of Justice said in May that several people were being
 detained under AG-26.
 In the most important detention case, the police detained six
 SWAPO members and trade unionists, five on August 18 and one
 on August 26, ostensibly under the Terrorism Act. They were
 Dan Tjongarero, Nico Bessinger, Hendrik Witbooi, Anton
 Lubowski, John Pandeni and, later, Ben Ulenga. The police
 claimed that they were being detained in connection with
 SWAPO's July bombing of a Windhoek parking garage. However,
 the Windhoek Supreme Court ordered the release of the six on
 September 11 and criticized the Government for continued
 recourse to the Terrorism Act, describing it as "draconian."
 Although courts cannot review detentions under the Terrorism
 Act, the Court released the detainees because the police had
 improperly invoked the Act.
 Some of the same SWAPO members and trade unionists had been
 arrested earlier in the year under AG-9, and SWAPO's Secretary
 for Labor was detained under the same decree in October. In
 at least three instances people were initially detained under
 AG-9 but later held under the more restrictive Terrorism Act.
 There were no legal challinges to the constitutionality of
 security legislation in 1987, as there had been in 1985 and
 1986, and all the security provisions remain in force.
 Although the TG's own "Bill of Fundamental Rights" stipulates
 that "no one shall be detained for an indefinite period of
 time without a fair and proper trial by a court," the uncertain
 status of the TG and continuing rule by South Africa prevented
 this right from being respected fully. The South African
 State President issued Proclamation 157 of 1986, which stated
 that no court would be competent "to inquire into or pronounce
 upon the validity" of any act passed by the South African
 Parliament before or after the formation of the TG. Since the
 TG has not won approval from South Africa to apply a new
 constitution, the Appeals Court in South Africa (the highest
 court for Namibian legal matters) ruled that no law in force
 before the institution of the Bill of Rights (June 1985) was
 subject to the Bill's provisions.
 There is no forced labor in Namibia.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The judiciary (Supreme Court, magistrate courts) is independent
 of the executive (TG), but its authority is limited by TG and
 South African legislation and subject to appellate review by
 the South African Court of Appeals in Bloemfontein. The
 Namibian judicial structure comprises two overlapping systems--
 one for whites, westernized blacks, and coloreds, and another
 for the indigenous African people. In 1919 Roman-Dutch law
 was declared the common law of the territory.
 
 
 209
 NAMIBIA
 Most trials are held in public, and the defendants have a
 right to counsel. Those who are brought to trial generally
 receive a fair hearing based on the legal merits of their
 case, and there is a right of appeal.
 There was no further action on the van Dyck Commission report,
 issued in October 1986, which proposed revisions in the
 security legislation. The Commission had recommended, inter
 alia, that the security laws be consolidated into one act.
 The Commission would permit the retention of detention without
 trial. The proposals would also place the burden on defendants
 to prove their innocence "beyond a balance of probability" once
 the prosecution has established that the alleged crime did
 occur and that the accused had some knowledge of it.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Security legislation allows the security forces almost
 unlimited powers of search and seizure. Invasion of homes is
 said to be commonplace in the northern operational zone. Cars
 are searched at security checkpoints. Telephones and mail of
 those unsympathetic to the TG and the security forces are
 believed to be monitored. Some individuals charge that they
 are under periodic surveillance. There have been allegations
 that security forces have threatened civilians to obtain
 information on suspected SWAPO insurgents.
 g. Violations of Humanitarian Law in Armed Conflicts
 Namibia has witnessed insurgency and counterinsurgency since
 1966. Aithough the combat action is often described as
 low-level guerrilla activity or as a "bush war," the
 cumulative costs in casualties and resources are high, and
 there is no end to the conflict in sight.
 In this long-running conflict, many innocent civilians have
 been hurt or killed. There are regular charges of abuse by
 security forces, particularly in the "operational area" of
 northern Namibia. The brother of a prominent church leader
 was killed in June. While the South African Defense Force
 admits shooting the man, Joseph Dumeni, SADF claims he was
 shot while violating the dusk-to-dawn curfew in the
 operational area in northern Namibia. His family claims,
 however, that he was killed in Angola before the curfew.
 There have been calls for a police investigation, and Dumeni's
 wife is suing the SADF and the South African Defense
 Minister. In June one young woman was killed by security
 forces during a disputed curfew violation. Several other
 people have been shot during alleged curfew violations. In
 early October, security forces allegedly killed one woman and
 injured two others at an Ovamboland hospital.
 Civilians have also been killed in the course of both security
 force pursuits of insurgents and SWAPO insurgent actions. Two
 were killed when a Koevoet armored vehicle reportedly ran over
 a hut in Ovamboland. The SWATF claimed that a SWAPO bombing
 of an Ovabo shop killed 2 and injured 22. Other civilians
 reportedly were killed when vehicles exploded landmines
 planted by the guerrillas. The Government alleged that two
 children were killed in October by antipersonnel mines planted
 by SWAPO. A SWAP0 bomb blast at a post office in Walvis Bay
 in November slightly injured one security guard. Two other
 bombs within a 24-hour period in Swakopmund and along a rail
 line in Windhoek caused minor damage and no injuries. Thd
 
 
 210
 NAMIBIA
 July car bomb in the parking garage of Windhoek's largest
 hotel and shopping center caused substantial damage but no
 injuries. Civilian casualties could have been significant if
 the bomb had exploded during business hours. There have been
 further allegations of kidnapings by SWAPO. Security forces,
 particularly Koevoet, have been accused of beating civilians
 during searches for insurgents or as a means of intimidating
 civilians in the north, ostensibly to discourage assistance to
 SWAPO guerrillas.
 The Government and SWAPO have blamed each other for several
 bombings or other attacks in 1987. The most notable example
 was the bombing and total destruction of a Roman Catholic
 church in Ovambo in September (there were no injuries). The
 security forces alleged SWAPO had carried out the action;
 SWAPO denied this, arguing that there was no reason to launch
 an attack against a group which is considered sympathetic to
 SWAPO.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Both South Africa and the TG restrict non-Namibians from
 speaking out on political issues within Namibia. The TG has
 the authority to ban outsiders from entering Namibia to give
 speeches. The law also bans rightwing groups--including the
 Conservative Party, the Herstigte Nasionale Party, and the far
 right Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging from speaking on plans for
 Namibian independence.
 Namibian newspapers are subject to South African press laws-
 including the Internal Security Act of 1950, which restrict
 reporting on some security matters. Nevertheless, Namibian
 newspapers can and often do publish stories critical of the
 security forces and TG. Although the Government controls the
 electronic media, newspapers represent views covering the
 entire political spectrum. Editorials have supported a
 variety of views, including pro-SWAPO sentiments. Newspapers
 also continue to publish stories critical of the activities of
 specific government employees.
 There were, however, instances of government restrictions on
 the press in 1987. The weekly, The Namibian, alleged that it
 was harassed and its reporters and photographers were not
 given equal access when covering security-related stories.
 The South African Directorate of Publications, which determines
 which stories are publishable, banned distribution of a January
 issue of The Namibian for publishing a photograph of an armored
 vehicle with bodies of dead SWAPO insurgents strapped to the
 outside of the vehicle. The South African authorities also
 banned a September edition of the weekly Observer, on security
 grounds.
 Publications which are banned in South Africa are for the most
 part also banned in Namibia. Some SWAPO publications have
 routinely been declared "undesirable" and thus illegal to sell
 or distribute. Windhoek bookstores carry some publications
 which one would not find in South Africa, and regulations
 regarding sexually oriented publications are somewhat less
 stringent in Namibia.
 
 
 211
 NAMIBIA
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Namibian law requires that persons wishing to organize public
 meetings must obtain prior approval from the Government under
 the Notification and Prohibition of Meetings Act. Bans on
 meetings can also be imposed under the Riotous Assemblies Act
 of 1956. The Windhbek Supreme Court removed some restrictions
 on SWAP0 meetings in 1986. As a result, there were no further
 outright bannings of SWAPO meetings in 1987, and SWAPO held
 several rallies including a May Day rally. However, security
 forces forcibly broke up some SWAPO meetings claiming they
 were acting in self-defense or were reacting to the presence
 of SWAPO members armed with weapons. In one incident, Rossing
 Uranium, one of the country's larqest employers, expressed its
 "extreie concern" over the police breakup of a SWAPO meeting
 near its mine in Swakopmund. The police said they arrested
 eight people for possession of dangerous weapons and claimed
 the eight attempted to attack the police. Others at the
 gathering, however, said that none of the rally-goers carried
 weapons and that the police action was unprovoked. Security
 forces have also fired teargas or rubber bullets
 indiscriminately at rallies, according to several witnesses.
 Labor unions are legal in Namibia, and they have the right to
 engage in collective bargaining and to strike. In 1987 there
 was substantial union activity and several strikes. There are
 approximately 15 unions in Namibia, several of which were
 first registered by the Government in 1987. Most Namibian
 workers are not unionized, but the majority of workers in the
 largest single private sector of the economy, mining, are
 unionized. To limit politicization of the unions, the
 Government has legally proscribed South African unions from
 organizing in Namibia. Unions represent different political
 views, but the largest unions, allied in the National Union of
 Namibian Workers (NUNW), are sympathetic to SWAPO, and their
 leaders are SWAPO officials.
 There are no industrial courts in Namibia, but there are
 conciliation boards. Although unregistered unions can bargain
 with their employers if they are recognized by management,
 they do not have access to conciliation boards. There were 43
 strikes in Namibia during the first 5 months of 1987, the last
 period for which figures are available.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Namibians enjoy freedom of religion. 'Almost all Namibians are
 Christians, with the Lutheran Church having .the most adherents:
 The largest group belongs to the Evangelical Lutheran Ovambo-
 Kavango Church, now known as the Evangelical Lutheran Church
 in Namibia (ELCIN). Roman Catholic, Anglican, Methodist, and
 Dutch Reformed churches are also active. There is one Jewish
 synagogue, in Windhoek.
 The majority of church leaders are openly critical of the TG,
 and are allied through the Council of Churches of Namibia
 (CCN). CCN leaders claim that they are regularly harassed,
 and several church officials were denied passports in 1987, as
 they had been in earlier years. The security forces and the
 Government have said that these church people are SWAPO
 supporters.
 
 
 212
 NAMIBIA
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 A dusk-to-dawn curfew in the entire operational area of
 northern Namibia remains in place. A legal challenge to the
 curfew by some church leaders failed in the Windhoek court in
 1986 and in the appeals court in South Africa in 1987. The
 curfew, as noted elsewhere, has served as the backdrop for
 several disputes over alleged human rights abuses by the
 security forces.
 Until November 16, 1987, when the requirement was eliminated,
 there were six security districts which no person could visit
 without first obtaining a police permit. The districts
 affected included Ovamboland, Kavangoland, Kaokoland,
 Bushmanland, Hereroland East, and the Eastern Caprivi.
 Obtaining a permit generally took 2 days. Church people
 complained that the permit requirements restricted their
 access to the north, where most of their parishioners live.
 South Africa, through the Administrator General in Windhoek,
 controls foreign travel by Namibians. There were several
 cases in 1987 where political opponents of the TG were denied
 either passports or travel documents. Since the holding of a
 passport is considered a privilege, not a right, those denied
 passports or travel documents cannot appeal through the
 courts. The Administrator General and his officers do not
 have to provide reasons for a denial.
 There were no known deportations under the "Residence of
 Certain Persons in South West Africa Regulation Act," which
 allows for the deportation of non-Namibians who threaten the
 public order.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Namibians do not have the right to change their government.
 South Africa still maintains control over the territory, even
 though the United Nations has declared South Africa's mandate
 illegal. While the Transitional Government in theory controls
 most.government portfolios except for defense and foreign
 affairs, the South African Government and its representative,
 the Administrator General, still maintain ultimate authority.
 The TG and the National Assembly are appointed, not elected,
 bodies. Namibia is administered by a three-tiered structure,
 created in 1980 under a decree, promulgated by the
 Administrator General, known as AG-8, which provides for a
 central legislative body (the National Assembly), 11
 ethnic-based second-tier authorities, and local or municipal
 authorities. Only some of the second-tier legislatures have
 been elected. The second-tier element, which currently
 establishes the Namibian political system on an ethnic basis
 rather than on a national nontribal basis, generates
 considerable internal political debate. The Transitional
 Government requested during 1987 that the Windhoek Supreme
 Court offer an advisory opinion on whether AG-8 violated the
 antidiscrimination provisions of the TG's Bill of Fundamental
 Rights. The opinion, which had yet to be issued at the end of
 1987, would not be binding. The possibility of ethnic or
 regional elections was discussed during 1987, but a 1-year
 moratorium has been issued on most second-tier elections.
 (The Ovambo and Damara authorities are not included in the
 moratorium.) The Rehoboth Basters, 1 of the 11 ethnic groups,
 
 
 213
 NAMIBIA
 are ruled under a separate dispensation and held elections
 December 16. Such elections are not recognized internationally
 because of the U.N. withdrawal of South Africa's mandate.
 UNSCR 435 calls for internationally supervised elections of a
 national constituent assembly as part of the independence
 process. Although UNSCR 435 calls for these elections before
 the drafting of a constitution, the South African President
 created a Constitutional Council containing members of the TG
 to devise a constitution. The Council reached majority but
 not unanimous agreement on a draft in 1987. However, this
 draft apparently was unacceptable to the South African
 Government because it did not provide adequate guarantees for
 minority ethnic groups. In June, after a meeting between
 South African Government and TG officials in Windhoek, it was
 decided to offer the majority draft and another one, supported
 by the South West Africa National Party and the Rehoboth
 Basters, for public-comment. Discussions among the TG
 majority, the TG minority, the Administrator General, and the
 South African Government on the constitution were continuing
 at the end of 1987.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Administrator General and the TG had a mixed record in
 1987 in permitting critics of Namibia's human rights situation
 to visit Namibia. A representative of the Lawyers' Committee
 for Human Rights initially was refused a visa, but then was
 allowed entry. Some church officials, including those
 belonging to the territory's largest denomination, the
 Lutheran Church, were allowed into the country. The TG
 refused two Lutheran groups visas for a "pastoral visit" in
 October, claiming the groups "are not in favor of the
 Government and they have not contributed to the peace and
 stability of this country." The Lutheran World Federation
 protested the visa denial to President Botha. During 1987 the
 International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) visited 25
 persons at Windhoek security prison who had been sentenced or
 were awaiting trial on the basis of security laws and arranged
 for family visits to the prisoners. The ICRC is seeking
 access to all detainees arrested in connection with the
 conflict, and negotiations among the ICRC, the TG, and the
 South African Government were continuing at the end of 1987.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Namibia's second-tier government authorities are based on the
 following racial and ethnic groups present in the territory:
 Ovambo, Whites, Damara, Herero, Kavango, Nama, Colored (mixed
 race), Kaokovelder, Bushmen, Rehoboth Baster, Caprivian, and
 Tswana. Namibia's population in 1987 was estimated at 1.3
 million, of whom just over half are Ovambo. There are
 approximately 75,000 whites in Namibia. Although some
 government revenues are shared among all the groups, much of
 the tax revenue collected from members of the different ethnic
 groups stays with that group. Thus, white medical and
 educational facilities are far superior to those of the other
 groups.
 Social facilities are generally open to all races, although
 private businesses can, and in some cases do, restrict
 admittance based on race. Unlike South Africa, residential
 areas are not legally segregated. Economic factors do,
 
 
 214
 NAMIBIA
 however, separate the races, and there are de facto black and
 "colored" townships in the territory. Some hospitals, such as
 the state hospital in Windhoek, admit all patients but have
 separate wings for different races.
 Although the majority of the TG is in favor of opening the
 schools to all races, schools remained segregated through
 1987. Under AG-8, the 1980 decree that first divided Namibia
 into 11 ethnic authorities, school administration is considered
 part of "own affairs," which are controlled by the ethnic
 authorities. The TG does not have the legal authority under
 AG-8 to force the ethnic administered schools to desegregate.
 The white second-tier authority has agreed to accept
 applications by individual schools that want to desegregate,
 but so far only one school has applied. In March the white
 legislative assembly approved a bill to eliminate race or
 color in themselves as factors in school admissions, but
 replaced them with factors such as culture, language, and
 religion, thus effectively perpetuating the segregated system.
 Further movement on the issue of school desegregation depends
 on the broader issue of the continuation of AG-8. As noted
 earlier, the Windhoek Supreme Court has been asked to give a
 nonbinding advisory opinion as to whether AG-S violates the
 TG's Bill of Fundamental Rights, which calls for an end to
 discrimination on the basis of race or ethnicity.
 The South West African National Party and the Rehoboth
 Basters, two TG parties, continued their opposition to open
 schools and a loosening of the various ethnic groups' control
 over "own affairs." Moreover, the South African Government
 has consistently expressed support for group rights and "own
 affairs" in Namibia as well as in South Africa.
 Women continued to be discriminated against in both the
 traditional and modern sectors. Under traditional practice, a
 woman is usually the ward of her father or, when married, her
 husband. She is not independent. There is still some de
 facto discrimination in employment in the modern sector.
 There are female members of the National Assembly, but there
 are no female cabinet members. Some community groups and
 government bodies are targeting women in their development
 programs.
 CONDITIONS OF LABOR
 There is no minimum wage in Namibia. The minimum working age
 is 15. The current occupational health standards are not
 enforced and were part of union demands for revision in 1987.
 A labor commission appointed by the Administrator General to
 review Namibia's outdated labor laws, including safety and
 health standards, is expected to make public its
 recommendations during the first half of 1988.
