 ICELAND
 Iceland is a democratic social welfare state with a bicameral
 parliament, the Althing, which is the oldest standing
 parliament in the world. Iceland's highly literate and
 educated people take a strong interest in political affairs
 and participate in high percentages for parliamentary and
 local elections, which are fair and free. Icelanders enjoy a
 fair and efficient civil and criminal justice system and are
 strong defenders of individual human rights. The nation has
 no military forces or political security apparatus.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for Integrity for the Person Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 Politically motivated killings did not occur.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no cases of abductions, hostage taking, or
 disappearances.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Torture and cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or
 punishment are prohibited by law and do not occur in
 practice. The operating methods of the police and prison
 conditions in Iceland are excellent by international standards.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Due process is guaranteed by law and observed in practice.
 The Constitution guarantees that any person detained by the
 authorities must be brought before a judge within 24 hours and
 either charged, bound over, or released. There were no
 allegations of arbitrary arrest. There is no preventive
 detention or forced labor, nor is exile practiced.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Defendants receive fair public trials. The courts are free of
 political control although the lower court system is
 administered by the Ministry of Justice. However, the Supreme
 Court carefully guards the lower courts' independence and
 fairness. Defendants are guaranteed the right to competent
 counsel of their own choice, and the State pays attorney fees
 when defendants are unable to do so. Juries are not normally
 used, but multijudge courts are common, particularly in the
 appeals process. There are no political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Under law and in practice, there is a longstanding, deep
 respect for the autonomy and rights of individuals. A warrant
 from a court is required for entry into a home except in cases
 of hot pursuit. Arbitrary intrusions by official entities,
 political organizations, or any other organized group into the
 personal liberties of Icelanders did not occur.

 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 A vigorous and independent press, a legal system which
 includes safeguards for individual rights, and a functioning
 democratic political system combine to ensure freedom of
 speech and press. Individual citizens and the media freely
 exercise their right to criticize the Government. Although
 most schools and institutions of higher education are publicly
 owned, academic freedom prevails. Censorship is applied to
 print and film materials in order to control public display of
 pornography and violence, but there is no other government
 censorship of any type.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 By law and in practice, persons are free to join together
 formally or informally to promote nonviolent causes or to
 protest government policies or actions. A varied and wide
 spectrum of voluntary organizations plays an important part in
 Icelandic politics and society. All such organizations and
 groups are free to maintain international contacts.
 Labor relations are highly organized and democratic. Workers
 and employers make extensive use of the right to establish
 organizations, to draw up their own constitutions and rules,
 to choose their own policies and representatives, and to
 bargain collectively on wages, working conditions, and other
 related issues. Labor unions are active and influential in
 the nation's economic and political life and in the
 development and administration of a comprehensive social
 welfare system.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Although the Lutheran Church is the established church of
 Iceland and the vast majority of citizens are nominally
 members, there is complete freedom for other faiths.
 Religicus affiliation is not a factor in political or social
 life.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Icelanders-have complete freedom to travel at home and abroad,
 to emigrate, and to return to Iceland at will.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 The political system is an open, fully functioning,
 parliamentary democracy with a high level of popular
 participation. Following the last parliamentary election in
 April 1983, there was an orderly transfer of power to a new
 coalition government. The remaining four political parties
 form the parliamentary opposition. A high voter turnout in
 elections, the use of party primaries to select most
 parliamentary candidates, proportional representation in
 multimember districts, and a cultural insistence on the
 representation of the views of all significant groups
 contribute to an active and informed political life.

 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigations of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 There were no reports of violations of human rights. Several
 human rights organizations in Iceland, including Amnesty
 International, take an active interest in international human
 rights issues.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based On Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Iceland has an ethnically homogeneous population of 241,750
 which enjoys a high standard of living and the benefits of a
 developed social welfare state on the Scandinavian model.
 Food, shelter, health care, and education are readily
 available to all without discrimination.
 Icelanders are highly egalitarian. Women participate freely
 in social, economic, and political life. Nevertheless, women
 are underrepresented in the professions, management, and
 politics and are continuing their efforts to expand their
 roles and rights. Iceland's popularly elected Chief of State
 is a woman, and one of its ten cabinet ministers is also a
 woman.
 CONDITIONS OF LABOR
 In the workplace, Icelandic workers are protected by laws
 designed to ensure their health and safety as well as to
 guarantee them unemployment insurance, paid vacations, and
 reasonable working conditions and hours. The employment of
 children below the age of 16 in factories, on ships, and in
 other places where hazardous conditions prevail or hard labor
 is required, is prohibited by law.
