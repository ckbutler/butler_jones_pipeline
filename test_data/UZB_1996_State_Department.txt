 UZBEK[STAN
 Uzbekistan is a state with limited civil rights. It took several steps toward creat-
 ing a less authoritarian society in 1996, the full effect of which is unclear. The Con-
 stitution provides for a presidential system with separation of powers between the
 executive, legislative, and judicial branches. In practice President Islam Karimov
 and the centralized executive branch that serves him remain the dominant forces
 in political life. The Oly Majls (Parliament) is dominated by the executive branch,
 and only parties that support the President are represented. Although the Constitu-
 tion provides for an independent judicial authority, in practice the judicial branch
 is heavily influenced by the executive branch in civil and- criminal cases.
 The police are controlled by the Ministry of Interior (MVD). The police and related
 MVD forces are responsible for most normal internal police functions. The National
 Security Service (NSS)-the former KGB-deals with a broad range of national se-
 curity questions, including orruption, organized crime, and narcotics. The army and
 border guards are responsible for external defense. Tey are not routinely used in
 internal disturbances and rarely are implicated in human rights abuses. The police
 and the NSS committee numerous, serious human rights abuses.
 The Government continued to move toward market reform, especially through im-
 provement in the legislative framework. However, in the last quarter of the year,
 it tookfinancial stepsnWhih ledsthe International Money Fmd to suspend its
 oan pdgram. Th       myi         prima     n agriagricultural proc-
 essing; zbekistan is the world's fith largest producer of cotton, the seventh largest
 producer of gold, and has substantial deposits of copper, strategic minerals, gas, and
 oil. The Government has proclaimed its commitment to a gradual transition to a
 free market economy. It has achieved substantial progress in reducing inflation and
 the budget deficit. However, prors on privatization of the large state-owned en-
 terprises that account for the bulk of gross domestic product remained slow, and a
 host of formal and informal barriers continued to constrain the nascent private sec-
 tor.
 The Government's human rights record improved, but serious problems remain.
 Citizens cannot exercise their right to change their government peacefully. Chosen
 president in a 1991 election that most observers considered neither free nor fair,
 Karimov had his stay in office extended to 2000 by a 1995 Soviet-style referendum.
 Parliament subsequently voted to make the extension part of Karimov's first term,
 thus making him eligible to run again in 2000. To control the political arena, the
 Government continues to deny registration to independent political parties and
 other groups potentially critical of the Government, and it prevents unregistered op-
 position parties and movements from operating freely or publishing their views. The
 Government continues to ban unsanctioned public meetings and demonstrations. Po-
 lice and NSS forces used torture, harassment, and illegal searches, and arbitrarily
 detained or arrested opposition activists on false charges. They committed these and
 other abuses against both dissidents and other citizens, although reported abuses
 against dissidents decreased sharply. Arbitrary arrest and detention is common;
 even foreigners are not exempt. Police often beat criminal suspects, and detention
 can be prolonged. Prison conditions are poor. Although the Government says that
 it investigates abuses, those responsible for documented abuses rarely appear to be
 punished. The Government severely limits freedom of spech and the press, and
 freedom of expression is onstrained by an atmsphere of repression that makes it
 difficult to criticize the Government publicly. Although the Constitution expressly
 prohibits it, press censorship continues. The Government sharply restricts the im-
 portation of foreign print media. The Government reimplemented a long-dormant
 politically motivated property confiscation order against opposition leader and
 former vice president, Shukrullo Mirsaidov, and harassed his family, apparently in
 retaliation  or Mirsaidov's remarks at an OSCE-sponsored seminar on national
 human rights institutions. The Government has harassed and arrested independent
 Islamic leaders on questionable grounds, citing the threat of Islamic extremism De-
 spite a constitutional prohibition, there continues to be significant traditional soci-
 etal discrimination and domestic violence against women.
 The Government took several steps to improve its international human rights
 image. President Karimov has made speeches calling for human rights reform and
 more press freedoms. During the summer, the Government released approximately
 15 prisoners alleged to be held for political reasons. It permitted Human Rights
 
 
 1212
 Watch/Helsinki (HRW/H) to open an office in Tashkent and invited exiled opposition
 leaders and human rights activists to return without fear of reprisal. Outspoken
 human rights activist Abdoumanob Pulat, chairman of the Human Rights Society
 of Uzbekistan (HRSU), visited Uzbekistan without incident. At a human rights con-
 ference in September, several government critics voiced their complaints about
 human rights abuses before an international audience in Tashkent. The Govern-
 ment registered one indigenous human rights organization, but declined to act on
 the registration application of the HRSU which has been seeking to register since
 1992. In April Radio Free Liberty opened an office in Tashkent.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political or
 other extrajudicial killings.
 The Government has never announced the results of its internal investigation into
 the 1995 death in police custody, almost certainly from a beating, of Bokhtiar
 Yakubov, a witness linked to an opposition activist.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 No developments were reported in the 1995 disappearance of Abduvali Kori
 Mirzaev the imam of an Andijon mosque who along with his assistant allegedly was
 detained at the Tashkent airport by NSS officers While en route to a conference in
 Moscow. Similarly, there were no new developments in the 1992 disappearance of
 Abdullah Utaev leader of the Uzbekistan chapter of the outlawed Islamic Renais-
 sance Party, wAo most observers believe, also was detained by security forces.
 There is no official admission that either man was arrested or detained and no fur-
 ther information on their whereabouts. However, most independent observers be-
 lieve that the three missing Islamic activists are either dead or in NSS custody.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Although the law prohibits these practices, police routinely beat and otherwise mis-
 treat detainees to obtain confessions. Both police and the NSS used beatings and
 harassment against citizens.
 On September 25, the Supreme Court completed its review of an appeal by the
 "Namangan 11," a group of young men who, evidence strongly suggests, were falsely
 accused of belonging to a Namangan city gang that committed a murder and several
 robberies. The Court commuted the death sentence of one and reduced the sentences
 of the other defendants. Lawyers at the hearing presented evidence that the defend-
 ants' confessions were obtained by beatings.
 Dmitri Fattakhov, a young man allegedly beaten nearly to the point of insanity
 by police to obtain his confession in a 1995 murder case, was permitted to go to Is-
 rael for medical treatment in early 1996.
 Police detained the representative of an international human rights nongovern-
 mental organization (NGO) overnight and subjected him to verbal abuse and
 humiliating treatment (see Section 1.d.). There were no reported developments, in
 the investigation of the 1995 kidnapings of former vice president Mirsaidv and his
 son.
 Prison conditions are poor, and worse for male than for female prisoners. Due to
 limited resources, prison overcrowding is a problem. Reportedly there are severe
 shortages of food and medicines. Political prisoners are often not allowed visitors or
 any other direct form of contact with family and friends. The Government operates
 labor camps, but little is known about the conditions of incarceration. The Govern-
 ment does not routinely permit prison visits by human rights monitors although
 diplomats have occasionally obtained access in specific cases.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Uzbekistan continues to use the Soviet
 legal system, and laws on detention have not changed since independence. Accord-
 ing to the law, police may hold a person suspected of committing a crime for up to
 3 days. At the end of this period, the suspect must be either officially charged or
 released. A procurator's order is reu  for arrests but not for detentions. A court
 case must be scheduled within 15 days of the arrest, and the defendant may be de-
 tained during this  riod. A defendant may not have access to counsel while in de-
 tention but only afer formal arrest. Delays between detention and trials can be
 lengthy--one Islamic cleric detained in September 1994 did not go on trial until
 May 1995.
 In practice police arbitrarily stop and detain individuals, whether dissidents or
 not, without warrant or just cause. In the past, opposition and religious figures have
 been charged with offenses such as drug possession, illegal possession of firearms,
 or disorderly conduct in an effort to stifle their criticism of government policy. There
 were no such reports in 1996.
 
 
 1213
 In March police detained opposition-linked human rights activist Paula Braunerg
 and her son when they found newspapers from Russia in her house during a search,
 allegedly for smug led gold. She was later released, and government officials admit-
 ted privately that the security forces had acted incorrectly in detaining her for pos-
 session of the newspapers.
 On August 30, three police officers, possibly intoxicated, arrested the local HRW/
 H representative a British citizen, as he returned from a dinner engagement with
 friends. At the district police station, two senior officials intimidated and verbally
 abused him, and accused him without basis of illegally possessing narcotics and fire-
 arms. He was forced to spend the night in a cold jail cell in his underwear. Police
 never brought charges. The Government claims that it carried out an internal inves-
 tigation and does not admit being at fault, but it has issued a written apology.
 The Government does not use forced exile.
 e. Denicl of Fair Public Trial.-Although the Constitution provides for an inde-
 pendent judicial authority, the judicial branch takes its direction from the executive
 There is a three-tier court system: the people's court on the district level, the re-
 gional courts, and the Supreme Court. District court decisions may be appealed to
 the next highest level within 10 days of the ruling. The new Criminal Co de reduces
 the list of crimes punishable by death to murder, espionage, and treason, eliminat-
 ing the economic crimes punishable by death in the former Soviet code. Officially
 and in recent practice, most court cases are open to the public but may be closed
 in exceptional cases, such as those involving state secrets, rape, or young defend-
 ants.
 Under the Constitution, the President appoints all judges for 10-year terms. They
 may be removed for crimes or failure to fulfill their obligations. Power to remove
 judges for failure to fulfill their obligations rests with the President, except for Su-
 preme Court judgs, whose removal must also be confirmed by Parliament.
 Uzbekistan stil uses the Soviet judicial system, which features trial by a panel
 of three judges: one professional judge and two "people's assessors" who are chosen
 by the workers' collectives for a period of 2 2 years. The judge presides and directs
 the proceedings. Defendants have the right to attend the proceedings, confront wit-
 nesses, and present evidence. The State will provide a lawyer without charge, but
 by law the accused has the right to hire an attorney. In some political cases, the
 defendants have not had access to lawyers.
 Detainees deemed not to be violent may be released on their own recognizance
 pending trial. No money need be posted as bnd, but in such cases the accused must
 usually sign a pledge not to leave the city.
 In pracice defense lawyers are unskilled at defending their clients. Courts often
 do not allow all defense witnesses to be heard, and written documents are given
 more weight than courtroom witnesses. In the case of the Namangan 11 (see Section
 1.d.), the defendants' written confessions, allegedly gained by beatings and repudi-
 ated by the defendants in court, appeared to have been given more weight than the
 testimony of eyewitnesses.
 Human Rights WatchiHelsinki and the HRSU have compiled lists of 20 to 30 indi-
 viduals believed to be political prisoners. Many were associated with the Birlik or
 Erk parties, or were involved in independent Islamic activities. Many were convicted
 of nonpolitical offenses such as tax evasion, misappropriation of funds, or illegal pos-
 session of narcotics or firearms. However, many observers question the failrness of
 the trials and believe that incriminating contraband was planted by arresting offi-
 cers. Six of the prisoners on the lists were paroled during the year, five of them
 under President Karimovs August amnesty. Three other prisoners were either re-
 leased or had their sentences reduced before 1996. The Government denies holding
 political prisoners.
 f. Arbitray Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correpondence.-By law
 search warrants issued by a procurator are required. There is no provision for a ju-
 dicial review of warrants. No legal mechanism exists for authorizing telephone tap-
 ping or monitoring. Security agencies routinely monitor telephone calls and employ
 surveillance and wiretaps in the cases of persons involved in opposition politicl ac-
 tivities.
 The Government does not allow general distribution of forei  news apers (with
 the exception of two or three very conservative Russian ones and ot er publica-
 tions. However, limited numbers of foreign periodicals began to appear in
 Tashkent's two major hotels, and authorized  rups can obtain foreign periodicals
 through subscription. The publication of the local editions of Izvestia and Pravda
 and the sale of their Moscow editions remained suspended throughout 1996. The au-
 thorities black out Russian news broadcasts when they are critical of the Govern-
 ment (see Section 2.a.).
 
 
 1214
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-Although the Constitution provides for "freedom
 of thought, speech, and convictions," the Government continues to severely limit
 these rights.
 As1991 law against "offending the honor and dignity of the President limits the
 ability to criticize the President. Journalists and ordinary citizens remain afraid to
 express views critical of the President and the Government.
 Information remains very tightly controlled. Although the Constitution prohibits
 censorship, it is widely practiced and the Government tolerates little, if any, criti-
 cism of its actions. Newspapers may not be printed without the censor's approval.
 Journalists and writers who want to ensure that their work is published practice
 self-censorship. Several speakers at the OSCE conference openly challenged the
 Government's assertion that there is no censorship.
 Although the President made several speeches advocating more freedom of the
 press, Vatan, .the newspaper of the p  vernment Fatherland Progress Party,
 eased publication temrrily aer pubishing an analtia piece about the Presi-
 dent's August 29 speech to Parliament on human rights, reportedly under pressure
 from government officials displeased by the article.
 The UzbekistanInformation Agency cooperates closely with the presidential staff
 to prepare and distribute all officially sanctioned news and information. Nearly all
 newspapers are goverament owned and contrlled; the key papers are organs of gov-
 ernment ministres. State enterprises control the printing presses.
 The last opposition newspaper to be published was that of the Erk party. In 1993
 it was banned and has not been published since.
 Magazines and weeklies have to be registered, a procedure that includes providing
 information about the sources of funding, means of distribution, founders and spon-
 sors. A resolution by the Cabinet of Ministers bans private persons and journalist
 collectives from founding newspapers or magazines. Foreign correspondents based
 in Tashkent report that the security services have harassed and threatened their
 translators and other local employees. Limited numbers of foreign periodicals are
 available, but the Government does not allow the general distribu.ion of foreign
 newspapers (see Section 1.f.).
 Television broadeasting is state controlled. Although there are local stations in
 various regions, nationwide programming is on two state-run channels that fully
 support the Government and its policies. The Ostankino channel from Russia broad-
 casts during the evening. Its news broadcasts are blacked out when they are critical
 of the Government. A cable television joint venture between the state broadcastin
 company and an American .company broadcasts the Hong Kon-based "Star TV"
 channes, including the British Broadasi      Corration (BBCY and Cable News
 Network world news, to Tashkent and a few other locations.
 However, there were instances in which the Government eased its restrictions.
 For example, at a human rights conference in Tashkent in September sponsored by
 the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), numerous dis-
 sidents, including the head of the HRSU, the son of the missing Andijon Imam, and
 the former vice president were allowed at the last minute to participate and express
 views critical (in some cases extremely so) of the Government. In the wake of the
 conference, the head of the HRSU and another dissident were interviewed on gov-
 ernment radio. Government television also aired a program in which short clips of
 critical speeches were aired, followed by longer rebuttals from government support-
 ers.
 In May the Government allowed Radio Free Liberty to open a bureau in
 Tashkent, staffed by two local Uzbek stringers. Radio Liberty, the Voice of America
 and BBd radio, along with the more expensive cable television channels noted
 above, are among the few sources of uncOntrolled news.
 In addition to state-controlled television, at least one major station in Samarkand
 considers itself independent. It claims not to receive any government subsidy and
 to exist wholly on income derived from advertisers. It currently has two channels
 and plans a third, devoted to business news. However, it is clearly sensitive to polit-
 ical concerns from the center and concentrates on nonpolitical news but claims not
 to be formally censored.
 There are no private publishing houses, and government approval is required for
 all publications.
 irtually all academic institutions and academies are experiencing increased au-
 tonomy, but freedom of expression is still limited. Most institutions are in the proc-
 ess of revising curriculums, and Western textbooks are in great demand.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Assodation.-The Constitution provides for
 the right of peaceful assembly, however, it also states that the authorities have the
 right to suspend or ban rallies, meetings, and demonstrations on security grounds.
 
 
 1215
 The Government must sanction demonstrations and does not routinely grant this
 permission.
 The Constitution provides for the right of freedom of association, but the Govern-
 ment limits the exerc-ise of this right by refusimg to register opposition political par-
 ties and movements opposed to the established order. The Constitution places broad
 limitations on the types of groups that may form and requires that all organizations
 be formally registered with the Government in accordance with procedures pre-
 scribed by law.In December the Parliament passed new legislation on political par-
 ties which increases the number of signatures required to register a political party
 from 3,000 to 5,000. A party must meet other requirements, such as providing an
 official address. The process for registering NGO's and other public associations is
 also difficult and time consuming, with many opportunities for official obstruction.
 Since 1992, the Government has repeatedly frustrated the efforts of the Human
 Rights Society of Uzbekistan (HRSU), a local human rights group with close ties to
 exiled opposition figures, to register officially. Immediately prior to the OSCE Con-
 ference m September, however, it granted permission for  e HRSU to hold a found-
 ing organizational meeting (kurultai), a pre isit for receiving registration. The
 Society subsequently pursued the next step inthe registration process by submitting
 its registration petition on October 3. On Janua..3, 1997, the Government declined
 to act on HRSU's application to register, asserting technical deficiencies in its pa-
 e rwork (see Section 4.). The Government earlier granted registration to another
 h an rights NGO, the Committee for Protection of Individual Rights, a group
 formed with the support of the Government.
 In earlier years, the Government repeatedly denied the attempts of the Birlik
 movement and Erk party to register as parties. Most of these organizations' leaders
 have since gone into exile and these organizations made no attempt to register in
 1996, reportedly because their remaining adherents in the count% are afraid of gov-
 ernment reprisals. The Constitution and a 1991 amendment to the law on political
 parties bans those of a religious nature. This principle is cited for previous denials
 of registration to religious parties, including the Islamic Renaissance Party (IRP).
 Other opposition activists have announced the formation of the "Adolat-True Path"
 party but have never pursued formal registration, claiming that their members are
 also afraid of government reprisals.
 Nonpolitical associations and social organizations usually did not encounter com-
 parable difficulties in registering, although bureaucratic delays and official suspicion
 continued to plague the registration process for such groups. Some evangelical
 churches and some foreign humanitarian assistance groups found it difficult to ob-
 tain registration or reregistration.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of religion and for
 the principle of separation of religion and state. However, despite allowing many
 groups to worship freely, for example, the Russian Orthodox and several other
 Christian denominations, the Government suppresses some religious gups that
 defy the authority of state-a ppointed religious authorities, particularly Islamic dis-
 sidents. In addition, despite the principle of separation of religion and state, the gov-
 ernment-controlled Spiritual Directorate for Muslims funds some Islamic religious
 activities.
 After the enforced atheism of the Soviet period, religious communities are experi-
 encing a significant revival. Religious education is becoming more widespread, al-
 though it is not included in state schools. While Islam is the religion of the majority,
 ethnic minorities may also practice their religion in relative freedom.
 However, tensions arise when churches attempt to convert across ethnic lines, es-
 pecially when they attempt to convert members of generally Muslim ethnic goups
 to Christianity. Although distribution of religious literature is legal in Uzbekistan,
 missionary activity and proselytizing is not.
 Fearing the destabilizing influence of extremist Islamic forces, the Government
 has sought to control the Islamic hierarchy, the content of imams' sermons, and the
 extent and substance of published Islamic materials. However, Islamic groups not
 afiliated with the Government form a "parallel Islam". The Government has de-
 tained a number of Fergana Valley Islamic clerics on various charges (see Section
 1.d). Bureaucratic restrictions have also inhibited the free operation of numerous
 religious schools. Dissident Islamic figures deny that they are extremists and claim
 that they are being persecuted for their unwillingness to "slavishly" praise the Gov-
 ernment's actions.
 Muslim leaders have been detained and harassed for acts of perceived insubor-
 dination and independence. In early 1996, the government-appointed mufti fired
 imam Abidkhon Nazarov, head of the Tukhtoboi mosque in Tashkent, and several
 other independent-minded Islamic clerics. These clerics were fired ostensibly for fail-
 ing a government-designed "imam test," which included questions about political
 
 
 1216
 
 and economic policy outside the traditional sphere of a religious cleric. The Govern-
 ment also closed the Andijon Friday mosque where missing imam Abduvali Kori
 Mirzaev (see Section 1.b.) formerly preached. The Kokand Friday mosque remains
 closed since mid-1995.
 There is no pattern of official discrimination against Jews. Synagogues function
 openly; Hebrew education (long banned under the Soviets), Jewish cultural events,
 and the pubication of a community newspaper take p lace undisturbed. However,
 the perception of bleak economic prospects; occasional harassment by low-level offi-
 cials, which some beieve is anti-Semitic in orign (other say that such incidents
 occur in the ontext of harassment which any resident of Uzbekistan may face); and
 the belief that militant Islam might become a strong force are motivating many
 Jews to consider emigration.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel,  Eation, and Re-
 patriation.-The Constitution provides for free movement within the country and
 across its borders, and the Government generally respected these right. The Govern-
 ment has largely completed the process of issuing new passports to citizens in place
 of the old Soviet ones. The new passports serve as both internal identity cards and,
 when noted, as external passports. In addition the Government has greatly sim-
 p lfied the process of obtaining exit visas, which are valid for a period of 2 years
 and no longer require invitations.
 Most barriers to emigration were lifted before the Soviet breakup. Although in
 some instances emigrants are delayed by long waits for passports and exit visas, po-
 tential emigrants who can find a host country willing to accept them are able to
 leave the country. Since independence, a ignificant number of non-Uzbeks, includ-
 ing Russians, Jews, Ukrainians, and others have emigrated, although no figures are
 available. These people have left because of their perception that economic condi-
 tions are better else ere and, in some cases, due to concern that future economic
 and social prospects for non-Uzbeks will be limited. A sizable number of Russian
 emigrants, finding poor economic conditions and discrimination in Russia, have re-
 turned to Uzbekistan.
 The travel of local citizens within Uzbekistan is not controlled, unlike travel by
 foreigners, including journalists. Due to treaties between their countries and
 Uzbkistan, citizens of the United States, France, Germany the United Kin gdom,
 and the Republic of Korea receive visas valid for travel tmroughout Uzbekistan.
 Other foreign visitors must have each city they wish to visit noted on their visas.
 Tourists see"  to check into hotels without the a propriate internal visa often find
 themselves having to pay fines or bribes to local officials. In mid-1995, a presi-
 dential edict decreed that the ancient cities of Tashkent, Samarkand, Bukhara, and
 Khiva would henceforth be "open cities," for which a separate visa notation is not
 required for nationals of any country. However, it is not clear whether implementing
 regulations are yet in place.
 The v lw on cityizenhip stipulates that citizens do not lose their citizephip if they
 reside overseas. However, since Uzbekistan does not provide for dual citizenship,
 those acquiring other citizenship lose Uzbekistani citizenship. If they return to
 Uzbekistan as foreign citizens, they are subject to foreign visa regulations. There
 is no evidence that anyone was denied permission to return.
 There is no law concerning the rihts of refugees and asylum seekers, and the
 Government does not recognize the right of first asylum. The Government considers
 asylum seekers from Tajikistan and Afghanistan to be economic migrants, and such
 individuals are subject to harassment and bribe attempts when seeking to regular-
 ize their status. They may be deported if their residency documents are not in order.
 The country hosts populations of ethnic Koreans, Mesketian Turks, and Crimean
 Ta       deorted to Centr  Asia  eSt    du   g Wold war              ups enjoy
 the same rights as other citizens. Al toug they are free to return to their ancestra
 homelands, absorption problems in those countries have slowed that return. The
 UNHCR estimates there are 30,000 Tajik and 9000 Afghan asylum seekers of
 which 2,000 have filed asylum requests with UNCR; 960 had received mandate
 refugee status by year's end. There re e no confirmed reports of forced repatriation
 of refugees.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 While the Constitution provides for this right, in reality citizens cannot exercise
 their right to change their government through peaceful and democratic means. The
 Government severely represses opposition groups and individuals and applies harsh'
 limits on freedom of expression, although pressure on dissidents decreased in 1996.
 No true opposition groups participated in government or were allowed to function
 legally.
 
 
 1217
 
 Uzbekistan is ruled by a highly centralized presidency, comprising the President
 a small inner circle of advisers and senior government officials. President Karimov,
 formerly the first secretary o? the Communist party in Uzbekistan under Soviet
 rule, was elected in a limited multicandidate election in 1991. A 1995 Soviet-style
 referendum and subsequent parliamentary decision extended Karimov's term until
 the year 2000. President Karimov and the executive branch retain control through
 sweeping decree powers, primary authority for drafting legislation, and control of
 virtually all government appointments, most aspects of the economy, and the secu-
 rity forces.
 Most government officials are members of the People's Democratic Party of
 Uzbekistan (PDP), formerly the Communist Party and still the country's largest
 party. However the Party as such does not appear to play a significant role in gov-
 ernment, and the President resigned his chairmanship of the party in 1996.
 The 1995 Parliamentary elections were limited to candidates and parties (the PDP
 and one other government-sponsored party) that support the President. Since then,
 several other government-sponsored parties have been created and entered Par-
 liament through unchallenged by-elections and other arrangements. The Oliy Majlis
 is constitutionally the highest government body. In practice despite assistance ef-
 forts by international donors to upgrade its ability to draft laws independently, its
 main purpose is to confirm laws and other decisions drafted by the executive branch
 rather than to initiate legislation.
 Few people were willing to challenge the Government's grip on power or even risk
 criticizing it publicly. During a June visit to the United States President Karimov
 invited opposition and human rights activists to return to Uzbekistan. In August
 Abdoumanov Pulat, head of the   RU (see Sion 4) and brother of exiled Birlik
 leader Abdurakhim Pulatov, returned temporarily from political asylum in the Unit-
 ed States to reassume leadership of the HRSU after a 4 -year absence. Pulat
 moved freely about the country and was not harassed. Some of the many remaining
 opposition flires in exile have expressed tentative interest in returning, but others
 report that they do not trust President Karimov's offer and have no intention of re-
 turning.
 The Government reimplemented a long-dormant, politically motivated property
 confiscation order against opposition leader and former vice president, Shukrullo
 Mirsaidov, and harassed his family, apparently in retaliation for Mirsaidov's re-
 marks at an OSCE-sponsored seminar on national human rights institutions. Police
 placed the family under surveillance and questioned neighbors after Mirsaidov
 spoke at the conference. On November 28, the Government evicted the family from
 r  artments in Tashkent to enforce a ong-tnng but previous    dormant
 property confiscation order against Miraaidov. During the trial, the  Yititrp
 g      h   district rep-
 resentative withdrew the action on grounds of insufficient evidence, but the prosecu-
 tor and judge refused to halt the trial. On November 9, Hasan Mirsaidov,
 Shukhrullo's sn, was abducted b several unidentified men under circumstances
 suggestive of official involvement. He was handcuffed, beaten, and threatened with
 execution, only to be released after 12 hours. No ransom demand was made on the
 family. The culprits had not been identified by the police at year's end.
 The Government does not officially forbid membership in any political organiza-
 tion. However, individuals whose names are linked with unregistered, opposition-
 linked organizations report that they are subject to telephonic and written harass-
 ment and discrimination in the workplace. Secular political dissidents report that
 harassment and surveillance have decreased significantly over the past year. Har-
 assment and surveillance of Islamic dissidents continue.
 Traditionally, women participate much less than men in government and politics.
 Only 13 of the 250 deputies in Parliament are female. In 1995 the President pro-
 moted the chairwoman of the governmental national women's committee to the posi-
 tion of Deputy Prime Minister. Her duties specifically include monitoring the rights
 and welfare of women.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of AUeged Violations of Human Rights
 The Government generally disapproves of local nongovernmental organizations
 working on human rights, and restricts their operations. Local NGO's face many ob-
 stacles. Laws left over from the Soviet period present difficulties in registration and
 operation for NGO's and private business alike.
 The Human Rights Society of Uzbekistan (HRSU), an opposition-linked group
 formed in 1992, has been the chief independent source on human rights abuses in
 Uzbekistan. In the past it was denied registration, and its activists were subject to
 prolonged harassment, including physicar violence. Prior to the OSCE conference in
 September, however, the Government permitted the HRSU to take the first step in
 
 
 1218
 the registration process, the holding of a founding congress, or kurultoL," in Sep-
 tember. HRSU activists continued to suffer harassment, although less than in pre-
 vious years. HRSU Chairman Pulat visited Uzbekistan for several months without
 incident. He participated openly in the OSCE human rigts seminar and subse-
 quently was interviewed by Uzbek radio. The HRSU publies reports in Moscow
 and circulates materials in Uzbekistan, but has no formal right to publish materials
 locally. The Government declined to act on HRSU's registration petition, asserting
 technical difficulties in its paperwork.
 A governmental human rights commission, headed by a parliamentary ombuds-
 man, was founded in 1995. It responds to complaints from citizens but has insuffi-
 cient trained staff to carry out in-depth investigations of human rights violations
 and does not vigorously pursue allegations agninst the police and security forces.
 The Government plans to upgrade its capabilities with United Nations assistance.
 After years of opposition and delay, the Government registered one human rights
 NGO n 1996, the Committee for Protection of Human Rights. It was formed with
 the support of the Government but has ties to opposition figures as well. It report-
 edly has had some success in investigating abuses and getting the Government to
 correct them, but it has been unable to publish its views because of censorship and
 lack of financial resources. Some sources affiliated with other groups have ques-
 tioned its true degree of independence from the Government.
 In the past, the Government sharply criticized international human rights groups
 and Western and Russian reporters for what it considered biased reporting on
 human rights in the country. The Government has continued to reject criticism from
 Moscow-based sources, but it has announced its willingness to hold an open dialog
 with international human rights NGO's. It permitted Human Rights Watch/Helsinki
 to open a Tashkent office in June. The opening followed two visits in 1995 by HRW/
 H monitors who met with both governmental and nongovernmental figures. A rep-
 resentative of Amnesty International also visited Uzbekistan in 1996.
 From September 11 to 13, the Government and the Office for Democratic Institu-
 tions and Human Rights (ODIHR) of the OSCE cosponsored a seminar on national
 human rights institutions. At the seminar, representatives of indigenous and inter-
 national NGO's, including secular and Islamic dissidents associated with those
 NGO's, gave presentations, several of which were extremely critical of government
 polices concerning the media, political parties, and religious freedom.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Rel4gion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 Both the Constitution and the 1992 law on citizenship prohibit discrimination on
 the basis of sex, religion, language, or social status, however societal discrimination
 against women" persists.
 Women.-Spousal abuse is common, but local activists do not have statistics. Wife
 beating is considered a personal family affair rather than a criminal act, and thus
 such cases rarely come to court.
 Although discrimination against women is prohibited by law, traditional cultural
 and religious practices severely limit their role in everyday society. For these rea-
 sons, women are severely underrepresented in high-level positions. In 1995 Presi-
 dent Karimov issued an edict on measures to increase the role of women in society,
 particularly extending their participation in state and social administration and co-
 ordinatin  the activities of ministries and social organizations as they relate to
 women's ssues. In this connection a new pst, deputy Prime Minister, was estab-
 lished with responsibilities for the management of matters connected with further-
 ing the role of women in society. The edict also created heads of women's aff airs
 in the autonomous republic of Karapastan, regions, cities, and districts. The
 Ministry of Finance was ordered to allocate the necessary funds to finance these
 new positions and working bodies.
 Duet   traditional roles, women, particularly in rural areas, usually marry before
 the age of 20, bear many children, and confine their activities within the family.
 In rul areas women often find themselves limited to arduous labor in the cotton
 fields. However, women are not formally impeded from seeking a role in the work-
 place: the barriers to equality for women are cultural, not legal, and women who
 opn businesses or seek careers are not legally hindered.
 Chidren.-IThe Consttion provides or children's rights, stating that parents
 are obliged to support and care for their children until they  e of age. In theory
 the State provides free universal primary education and health care. In p racice
 shortages and budget difficulties mean that some services must be paid for pri-
 vately. The State grants monetary allowances to families based on their number of
 children. There is no societal pattern of abuse of children. Uzbekistan has a very
 high birthrate; over one-half of the population is under the age of 15.

 People With Disabilities.-One of the country's first laws, adopted only 2 months
 after independence in 1991, provided support for the disabled. This law was aimed
 at ensuring the disabled the same rights as other people. However, little effort is
 made to bring the disabled into the mainstream. The State cares for the mentally
 retarded in special homes. The Government has not mandated access for the dis-
 abled.
 NationalIRaciallEthnic Minorities.--Government statistics show that the popu-
 lation of approximately 23 million is about 71 percent Uzbeks, 8 percent Russians,
 5 percent Tajiks, 4 percent Tatars, and 3 percent Kazaks, with many other ethnic
 groups represented.
 The citizenship law, passed in 1992, does not impose language requirements for
 citizenship. Nonetheless, the language issue remains very sensitive. Uzbek has been
 declared the state langage, and the Constitution requires that the President speak
 Uzbk. However, the angag     "aw provides for Russian as the language of inter-
 ethnic communication.' Russian is widely spoken in the main cities, and Tajik is
 widely spoken in Samarkand and Bukhara. The language law, passed in 1989, origi-
 nally required that Uzbek would be the sole method of official communication by
 1997. Uzbekistan also plans to replace its Cyrillic alphabet with the Latin alphabet.
 However, realizing the difficulties for Uzbeks and minorities alike, the Government
 has delayed the full transition to both Uzbek and the Latin alphabet to 2005.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The 1992 law on unions specifically provides that
 all workers have the right voluntarily to form and join unions of their choice and
 that trade unions themselves may voluntarily associate territorially or sectorally.
 Membership in trade unions is optional. The law also declares all unions independ-
 ent of the State's administrative and economic bodies (except where provided or by
 law), and states that trade unions should develop their own charters, structure, and
 executive bodies and organize their own work.
 In practice, however, the overall structure of trade unions has not changed signifi-
 cantly since the Soviet era. Independence has eliminated subordination to the Soviet
 Union or Russia but has not altered the centralized trade union hierarchy, which
 remains dependent on the Government. No "alternative" central union structures
 exist. A few new professional associations and interest groups have been organized,
 such as a union of entrepreneurs, a union of renters, an association of private physi-
 cians and pharmacists, and one of lawyers. Their role, degree of independence from
 the Government, and strength are as yet uncertain. Some of these hope to play a
 significant role in licensing and otherwise regulating the economic activity of their
 members.
 According to the law, the Council of the Federation of Trade Unions (CFTU) has
 a consultative voice in the preparation of all legislation affecting workers and is en-
 titled to draft laws on labor and social issues. Trade unions are legally described
 as organizations that defend the right to work and protect jobs. Theyhave lost their
 previous role in state planning and in the management of enterprises. The emphasis
 now is on the unions' responsibility for "social protection" and social justice--espe-
 cially unemployment compensation, pensions, and worker retraining.
 The trade union law does not mention strikes or cite a right to strike. However,
 the law does give the unions oversight over both individual and collective labor dis-
 putes, which are defined as those involving alleged violations of labor laws, worker
 rights, or collective agreements.
 There were few reports of strikes. Both union and government officials assert that
 this reflects general support for the Government's policies and common interest in
 social stability. It probably also reflects the absence of truly representative trade
 unions as the standard of living fell, and growing unemployment raised social ten-
 sions. Worker collectives in rural areas conducted sit-ins and demonstrations for
 nonpayment of salaries. In most cases, the local government made arrangements for
 payment, and the groups dispersed peacefully.
 The 1992 law on unions provides that unions may choose their own international
 affiliations.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Colleetively.-Trade unions may conclude
 agreements with enterprises. Privatization is in its very early phases, so there is
 no experience yet with negotiations that could be described as adversarial between
 unions and private employers. With very few exceptions, the State is still the major
 employer, and the state-appointed union leaders donot view themselves as having
 conflicts of interest with the State.
 The Ministry of Labor and the Ministry of Finance in consultation with the
 CFTU, set the wages for various categories of state employees. In the small private
 
 
 1220
 sector, management establishes wages or negotiates them with those who contract
 for employment.
 The law forbids discrimination against union members and their officers, and no
 complaints were registered.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Constitution specifically pro-
 hibits forced labor, except as legal punishmnt or as may be specifiedby law. Laie-
 scale compulsory mobilization of youth and students (by closing schools) to hewlpwith
 the cotton harvest continues. Young people i rural areas are expected to partcipate
 "voluntarilf in harvesting activities of all kinds, and universities still shut down
 temporsrily to send both students and faculty into the fields.
 d. Minimum .Age for Employment of Children.-The minimum working age is 16
 years; 15-year-olds may work with permission but have a shorter workday. i rora
 areas, younger children and the elderly often turn out to help harvest cotton and
 other crops. The Labor Ministry has an inspection service responsible for enforcing
 compliane with these and other regulations gveg employment conditions.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Wori.-The Ministry of Labor, in consultation with the
 CFTU, sets the minimum wage. As of December 1, it was about $11.00 (600 som)
 per month. The minimum wage is not sufficient to provide a decent living for a
 worker and family. The workweek is set at 41 hours per week and includes a 24-
 hour rest period. Some factories have apparently reduced workhours in order to
 avoid layoffs. Overtime pay exists in theory but is not always paid.
 The Labor Ministry establishes occupational health and safety standards in con-
 sultation with the unions. There is a health and safety inspectorate in the Ministry.
 Workers do leave jobs that are hazardous without apparent jeopardy to continued
 employment; but the local press occasionally published complaints about the failure
 of unions and government authorities to do enough to promote worker safety. Al-
 though written regulations may provide adequate safeguards, workers in hazardous
 jobs often lack protective clothing and equipment.
 In theory workers may remove themseives from hazardous conditions without
 jeopardizing their continued employment. In practice high rates of underemploy-
 ment make this step difficult.
