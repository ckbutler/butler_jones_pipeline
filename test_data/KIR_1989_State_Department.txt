 XIRIBATI
 Some 63,000 people, mostly of Micronesian and Polynesian
 background, occupy Kiribati's 33 islands scattered across a
 wide area of the Central. Pacific.. Kiribati gained full
 independence from the United Kingdom in 1979 and became a
 republic within the Commonwealth of Nations. It has a
 nationally elected president and a 35-member legislative
 assembly.eleqted by universal suffrage. Local affairs are
 handled in a manner similar to the procedures followed in New
 England town meetings. The only security apparatus is a small
 police force, responsible'to and effectively controlled by
 civilian authority.
 The economy is very small; the majority of the population is
 engaged in subsistence agriculture and farming. The islands'
 isolation and their meager resources, including poor soil and
 limited arable land, severely limit prospects for economic
 development. Fishing is viewed as one of Kiribati's few
 economic opportunities.
 Kiribati society is egalitarian,'democatic', and respectful of
 human rights. There were no important-human rights issues in
 1989.

 which he is charged and be provided adequate time and
 facilities to prepare a defense. The right to confront
 witnesses, present evidence, and appeal convictions is
 enshrined in law. Procedural safeguards are based on English
 common law and are generally similar to those in Western
 democracies. The judiciary is independent and free of
 governmental interference. There are no special courts for

 political or security offenses. Kiribati has no political
 prisoners.

 or political organizations into the private life of the
 individual. Membership in political organizations is entirely
 voluntary.

 association, including the right to form or belong to
 associations for the advancement or protection of the group's
 interests. There are no significant restrictions in practice.
 For a discussion of freedom of association as it applies to
 labor unions, see Section 6.a.

 no state or preferred religion. Missionaries are free to seek
 converts and actively do so.

 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Kiribati citizens are free to travel within the country and
 abroad. There are no restrictions on repatriation. Kiribati

 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right-of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 The Government is chosen by the people in free and open
 elections. Executive authority is exercised by the President,
 who is elected by the people. Three presidential candidates
 are nominated by the elected House of Assembly from its
 members. The current President has held that position since
 independence. The only political party is one formed to
 oppose some of his policies.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 There have been no reported allegations of human rights
 violations by the Government and no known requests for
 investigations. There are no local nongovernmental
 organizations which concern themselyes with human rights. The
 Government has not taken an active interest in international
 
 
 875
 KIRIBATI
 human rights matters. Kiribati is not a member of the United
 Nations.
 Section.,5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 The Constitution prohibits discrimination on the basis of
 race, creed,.or national origin. The traditional culture, in
 which males are dominant, has been an impediment to women
 taking a more active role in the economy. This is slowly
 changing, and more women are finding work in unskilled and
 semiskilled occupations. Statistics on the participation of.
 women in the work force and comparative wages are unavailable.
 Women have full rights of ownership and inheritance of
 property. No information is available on violence against
 women in this isolated, rural society. If wife beating
 exists,.it has not become a notable public concern. There
 were no reports of discrimination in the provision of social
 services by the .Government. Kiribati.has no significant
 discrimination based on race, religion, language, or social
 status. Kiribati society, being fundamentally egalitarian,
 does not have the privileged chiefly class of some other
 Pacific island societies.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Kiribati workers are free to organize unions and choose their
 own representatives. The Government does not control or
 restrict the unions. Trade union members and properties are
 respected. The right to strike is provided for by law.
 However, strikes are rare, the last one having taken place in
 1980.
 Kiribati has a relatively strong and effective trade union
 movement. In 1982 the seven trade unions registered in
 Kiribati merged to form the Kiribati Trade Union Congress
 (KTUC). It has approximately 2,500 members, most of them
 drawn from the public service. The KTUC is affiliated with
 the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions. Kiribati
 does not belong to the International Labor Organization (ILO).
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 Collective bargaining is a guaranteed right. Negotiations are
 generally nonconfrontational, in keeping with Kiribati
 tradition. There have been no reports of antiunion
 discrimination. Mechanisms exist, however, for resolving any
 complaints of antiunion discrimination. Kiribati has no
 export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 There is no forced or compulsory labor in Kiribati.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 Kiribati law prohibits the employment of children under age
 14. Children age 15 are prohibited from industrial employment
 and employment aboard ships. Children are rarely employed
 outside the traditional economy.

 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 Although legislation authorizing the Government to set minimum
 wages exists, it has not yet been implemented. The Government
 has under consideration an ILO-funded study on procedures for
 establishing minimum wages. Employment laws also provide
 basic health and safety standards for the workplace.
 Employers must, for example, provide an adequate supply of
 clean water for their workers and must ensure the existence of
 sanitary toilet facilities. Employers are liable for the
 expenses of workers injured on the job. The Government's
 ability to enforce employment laws is constrained by a lack of
 qualified enforcement personnel, a lack it is attempting to
 remedy by improvements in training of the relevant personnel.
 Women may not work at night except under specified
 circumstances (generally in service jobs such as hotel
 clerks). Women are provided up to 12 weeks of maternity leave
 and are entitled to not less than 25 percent of their regular
 salaries during such leave. Nursing women are allowed
 one-half hour twice a day during working hours to nurse a
 child.
