 LAOS
 The Lao People's Democratic Republic (LPDR) is an authoritarian one-party state
 ruled by the Lao People's Revolutionary Party (LPRP). The judiciary is subject to
 executive influence.
 The Ministry of Interior (MOI) remains the main instrument of state control. MOI
 police maintain order and monitor Lao society and foreign nationals, including for-
 eign officials and diplomats. The degree of surveillance varies by locality, but overall
 has diminished considerably in recent years.
 Laos is an extremely poor country. After the LPRP came to power in 1975, at
 least 350,000 people fled the country to escape the Government's harsh political and
 economic policies. Since 1986 the Government has largely abandoned its Socialist
 economic agenda. Economic reforms have moved the country from a moribund, cen-
 trally planned system to a growing, market-oriented economy open to foreign invest-
 ment.
 There has been a general trend away from the harsh conditions that existed after
 the LPRP assumed power in 1975, but serious problems remain. Citizens do not
 have the right to change their government. Even with ongoing economic liberaliza-
 tion, the adoption of a Constitution in 1991, and National Assembly elections in
 1993 and 1997, the Government has only slowly eased restrictions on basic freedoms
 and begun codification of implementing legislation for rights stipulated in the Con-
 stitution. Many of the rights provided for in the Constitution have not been codified
 with implementing legislation. In practice, the Government restricts the freedoms
 of speech, assembly, and, to a lesser extent, religion, even though they are provided
 for in the Constitution. Citizens do not have the right to privacy and do not enjoy
 a free press, although most citizens have ready access to a variety of foreign media.
 Prison conditions remain harsh, and some societal discrimination against women
 and minorities persists.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political
 killings by government officials.
 In May government troops shot two European tourists camped in a remote area,
 killing one and wounding the other, possibly prompted by attacks on government
 troops by antigovernment elements in the area. Those responsible for the shooting
 had not made adequate efforts to identify the campers before firing. The Govern-
 ment has not publicly charged the soldiers. The Government does not ordinarily
 publicize lethal incidents.
 On January 16, unknown persons reportedly killed eight Hmong villagers, includ-
 ing five children, in a remote mountainous area. Villagers from the area said that
 the perpetrators were ethnic Hmong not associated with the Government. The Gov-
 ernment's human rights monitoring unit said that it is investigating the report.
 Attacks by armed bands on government, foreign, and Lao travelers and business-
 men continued in the central and north central region. The attacks apparently in-
 volve a mixture of factors including insurgency, clan rivalry, highway robbery and
 reaction to encroaching development.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 
 
 832
 In September 1993, Vue Mai, a Hmong leader who in November 1992 returned
 voluntrily to Laos from a refugee caxp in Thailand, disappeared in Vientiane. No
 new information relevant to the case cane to light during the year.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Penal Code prohibits torture or mistreatment of prisoners, and the Government
 generally observed these principles in practice.
 Prison conditions are harsh but not lifethreatening. Prison authorities deny some
 prisoners regular family visits, and medical care ranges from inadequate to non-
 existent. Inmates sometimes resort to bribing guards to obtain food and medicines.
 Prison conditions for women are similar to those for men. The extent of sexual har-
 assment in prison is unknown, but it is not believed to be a serious problem. There
 is no independent monitoring of prison conditions.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution and Penal Code provide
 some protection, including a statute of limitations for those accused of crimes, but
 the Government does not fully respect these provisions. Those accused of hostility
 toward the regime are subject to arrest and confinement for long periods.
 An unconfirmed report that eight Hmong were arrested by the Government in
 Xieng Khouang province was submitted to the newly established human rights mon-
 itoring unit in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which is investigating the charge (see
 Section 3).
 While citizens have the protection of due process, authorities have reportedly ar-
 rested some persons based on unsupported accusations and without informing them
 of the charges, the accusers' identities, or their legal rights. Due process rights are
 unevenly upheld across the country.
 The Government does not use forced exile.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution provides for the independence
 of judges and prosecutors and protects their decisions from outside scrutiny. In prac-
 tice, however, the courts, which are understaffed and poorly trained, appear to ac-
 cept recommendations of other government agencies, especially the Ministry of Inte-
 rior, in making their decisions.
 The judiciary is composed of district courts, provincial courts, and the Supreme
 Court.
 Although regulations provide for public trial, widespread ignorance of constitu-
 tional rights among both citizens and law enforcement authorities at times results
 in trials that are little more than public announcements of predetermined verdicts.
 Politically sensitive trials have not been open to the public, although trials of civil
 crimes appeared to be open; these are increasingly publicized in the media. The
 Government held seminars for court officials during the year to increase awareness
 of legal rights and procedures, and government publications have printed articles
 describing citizens' rights.
 There is provision for appeal to the provincial courts and the Supreme Court. Sen-
 ior government and party officials reportedly may also review politically sensitive
 cases.
 The Constitution provides that all accused persons have the right to defend them-
 selves in court. A board of legal advisors formed in 1991 was suspended in 1992,
 pending enactment of a legally clarified body of governing regulations. The Govern-
 ment strengthened the legal profession and individual rights to counsel in 1996 by
 establishing a formal bar association. According to the Criminal Code, defendants
 in criminal cases are entitled, at their own expense, to representation by a "rights
 protector" who may be a practicing attorney. However, because citizens are largely
 unaware of their rights and legal authorities are not required by law to enlighten
 them, few defendants seek or have legal representation.
 Arrests, trials and convictions are usually unannounced, thereby complicating ef-
 forts to estimate accurately the number of political prisoners. Three former govern-
 ment officials are serving 14-year sentences handed down in 1992 for advocating a
 multiparty system and criticizing restrictions on political liberties.
 There has been no new information concerning three men sentenced in 1992 to
 life terms for crimes allegedly committed during their tenure as officials of the pre-
 vious regime.
 The Government claims that three other officials of the former government re-
 leased in 1992 have chosen to remain in the same remote province where they and
 the six prisoners mentioned above were held. There have been no reports of other
 political prisoners in the last few years.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-At the
 same time that it sought to liberalize the economy, the Government relaxed some
 elements of state control, including its rigorous police monitoring of personal and
 business activities and enforcement of the nighttime curfew. However, while the
 Constitution prohibits arrests or searches in homes without a warrant or authoriza-
 
 
 833
 
 tion, the security bureaus may authorize search and seizure by themselves rather
 than by judicial authority. The Government and the Party continue to monitor citi-
 zens sporadically through a system of neighborhood and workplace committees. The
 neighb~orhood ommittees also have responsibility for maintaining public order and
 reporting "bad elements" to the police. These committees usually concern themselves
 mare with street crime and instances of moral turpitude than with political activ-
 ism. The degree of surveillance and control varies from province to province, but
 overall has ditminished considerably in recent years.
 The Penal Code forbids telephone monitoring without proper authorization, but
 the security bureaus are believed to authorize such monitoring themselves. The
 Government continued to monitor international mail and telephone calls, probably
 including some faxes, although the increasing number of such calls limited the scope
 of such surveillance.
 In May the National Assembly passed a new land law that reaffirmed the con-
 stitutional provision that land is the property of the national community. The law
 sets standards for the size of land holdings, but parties may lease additional land
 from the State. Individuals may acquire land use rights through state grants, trans-
 fer or inheritance. While the law does not recognize the land claims of those who
 fled abroad, claims for houses and physical property are recognized. In the past,
 many citizens who fled the country have regained confiscated property by dem-
 onstrating their intent to repatriate.
 Contact between ordinary citizens and foreigners has increased in recent years as
 restrictions such as the requirement for government approval of invitations to most
 foreigners' homes are no longer enforced. The Government allows citizens to marry
 foreigners, but only with its prior approval. Marriages without government approval
 maybe annulled, with both partners subject to fine and arrest.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-Despite the constitutional provisions for free-
 dom of speech and the press, the Government exerts broad control over the exercise
 of these freedoms and has reacted harshly to expressions of political dissent. Three
 persons arrested in 1990 after persisting in public criticism of party policies and
 calling for fundamental political and economic change, each received 14-year sen-
 tences in 1992 (see Section L.e.). The Penal Code forbids slandering the State, dis-
 torting party or state policies, and spreading false rumors conducive to disorder. It
 also prohibits disseminating books and other materials that authorities deem inde-
 cent or that would assail the national culture.
 All domestically produced newspapers and radio and television are controlled by
 the Government. Local news in all media reflect government policy; however, foreign
 news reports, including those from Western sources, are usually translated without
 bias. In recent years, the Government has relaxed its control of the flow of informa-
 tion from abroad, and Thai and Western newspapers and magazines have been sold
 in the towns where there is demand for them. The Government makes no effort to
 discourage reception of Thai radio or television broadcasts. These are widely re-
 ceived nationwide via an increasing number of satellite dishes.
 The Government requires registration of satellite television receiving dishes and
 pament of a one-time licensing fee for their installation, but otherwise makes no
 effort to restrict their use. In 1997 the number of such dishes continued to increase,
 both in major urban areas and in remote provincial and district towns. The Cable
 News Network (CNN), the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC), and several sta-
 tions in Thailand are among the many channels available to satellite dish owners.
 The Government prohibits pornographic or politically inflammatory video-
 cassettes. In late 1994 the Vientiane Municipality imposed restrictions governing
 the content of music played in night clubs and outlawed karaoke in order to
 strengthen Lao culture against its perceived erosion by foreign influences. Enforce-
 ment of these restrictions, lax in recent years, was stepped up in 1997.
 The Government restricts academic freedom; however, it has relaxed its restric-
 tions in certain areas. The Ministry of Education still approves all grants for study
 and research abroad, and the Government also monitors and may restrict the activi-
 ties of Western scholars doing research in Laos. However, the Government, which
 once limited the foreign travel of academicians and professionals, now actively solic-
 its scholarships and training programs abroad from donor countries. Groups of 30
 or more professionals have traveled to Singapore and elsewhere in recent years for
 training related to membership in ASEAN.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Penal Code prohibits dem-
 onstrations or protest marches aimed at causing turmoil and social instability, pre-
 scribing penalties of from 1 to 5 years' imprisonment. Although the Constitution
 provides citizens with the right to organize and join associations, all associations are
 
 
 834
 party-controlled, and their products reflect official policy. Foreigners are not allowed
 to engage in political activity.
 c.Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution contains provisions for religious free-
 dom. In practice, the Government continues to restrict freedom of religion, especially
 for some Christian denominations.
 Links with coreligionists and religious associations in other countries require gov-
 ernment approval. Although the Government permits foreign nongovernmental or-
 ganizations with religious affiliations to work in the country, it prohibits foreigners
 from proselytizing. The Government also restricts the import of foreign religious
 publications and artifacts.
 The enforcement of these regulations varies by province. For example, the Catho-
 lic Church is unable to operate in the highlands and much of the north, but Catho-
 lics can openly attend churches and chapels in central and southern Laos. In No-
 vember a Catholic bishop was installed in the southern province of Khamoune. Sev-
 eral Protestant denominations operate more than 100 churches throughout the
 country. The Government granted approval to four Protestant congregations for the
 renovation or construction of church buildings in the Vientiane area. There continue
 to be reports that some local authorities harassed practicing Christians. The persist-
 ence of such reports underscores the continuing suspicion on the part of aut orities
 toward some parts of the Lao Christian community.
 By comparison, the Government openly encourages Buddhism and supports Bud-
 dhist organizations. High-ranking government officials routinely attend religious
 functions, and Buddhist clergy are prominently featured at important state and
 party functions. The Government permits Buddhist festivals without hindrance.
 Two mosques and a Baha'i center operate openly in Vientiane.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-There are no domestic travel restrictions for citizens and private foreign
 visitors except in areas considered unsafe. Most citizens can easily obtain passports
 and exit permits from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for  rsonal travel abroad.
 Border crossing permits to visit Thailand are routinely available from local village
 committees for a modest issuance fee, and the Government does not appear to inter-
 fere with persons desiring to emigrate. Except for around 30 persons convicted in
 absentia in 1975 for antigovernment activities, citizens have the right of return.
 The stated government policy since 1977 is to welcome back the approximately
 10 percent of the population that fled after the change of government in 1975. In
 recent years, an increasing number of ethnic Lao living abroad returned to visit;
 several remained to operate businesses.
 Laos, Thailand, and the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) are co-
 operating on the return of the Lao asylum seekers in camps in Thailand who volun-
 teer to return to Laos. This program includes provisions for monitoring returnees
 to ensure that they are given the same rights and treatment as resident Lao. Ac-
 cording to the UNHCR and voluntary agencies, returnees are not subject to dis-
 crimination or persecution, and returnees are allowed to return with all the belong-
 ings they accumulated while outside the country. There were no forcible repatri-
 ations to Laos in 1997. However, the UNHCR assisted the voluntary repatriation
 of 222 Lao from China, 33 from Thailand, -and 26 from other countries during the
 year. No new Lao asylum seekers arrived in Thailand.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens do not have the ability to change their government, despite constitutional
 prvisions for the public election of National Assembly members. While the Con-
 stitution does not explicitly exclude formation of multiple political parties, it assigns
 to the ruling LPRP the leading role in the political system. All candidates needed
 the approval of the LPRP before le gslative elections held in December. While no
 other parties were allowed, four of the candidates were not nominated by party or-
 ganizations. One winning candidate was not an LPRP member. While voting was
 not mandated by law, many voters believed that it was so. Reported voter turnout
 was 98 percent.
 The percentage of women in the National Assembly rose from a previous level of
 9 percent to 20 percent as 20 of the 27 female candidates won seats. The number
 of ethnic minority members also increased to levels that reflect national ethnic di-
 versity. Three members of the 49-member LPRP Central Committee are women.
 There are no women in the Politburo or the Council of Ministers.
 Men of lowland Lao origin dominate the upper echelons of the party and the Gov-
 ernment. Nonetheless, the Prime Minister, the Deputy Prime Minister, the Minister
 of Interior and 35 members of the National Assembly are believed to be members
 of ethnic minority groups. Members of these minorities often adopt lowland Lao
 
 
 names as they are increasingly assimilated into mainstream society, thus making
 it difficult to ascertain accurately the number of ethnic minority members in any
 organization.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 There are no domestic human rights groups. Any organization wishing to inves-
 tigate and publicly criticize the Government's human rights policies would face seri-
 ous obstacles if it were permitted to operate at all. The Government generally does
 not cooperate with international human rights organizations.
 The Government maintains ongoing contacts with the International Committee of
 the Red Cross. The Government has permitted U.N. human rights observers to mon-
 itor the treatment of returning refugees without interference, In September the Gov-
 ernment designated the Foreign Ministry's Department of Treaties and Inter-
 national Laws as the organ responsible for responding to inquiries about specific
 human rights questions.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution provides for equal treatment under the law for all citizens with-
 out regard to sex, social status, education, faith, or ethnicity. Although the Govern-
 ment took action when cases of discrimination came to the attention of high-level
 officials, the legal mechanism whereby a citizen may bring charges of discrimination
 against an individual or organization is neither widely developed nor widely under-
 stood among the general population.
 Women.-There are reports that domestic violence against women occurs, al-
 though it is not widespread. Sexual harassment and rape are reportedly rare. In
 cases of rape that are tried in court, defendants are generally convicted. The Gov-
 ernment has increased monitoring and educational programs provided by the Wom-
 en's Union and the Youth Union, both party-sanctioned organizations, designed to
 educate girls and young women about the schemes of recruiters for brothels and
 sweatshops in Thailand and elsewhere. The Women's Union worked closely with
 Thai nongovernmental organizations to bring justice in the case of three Lao women
 raped wvhxle incarcerated in Thailand.
 In'the past, the Government has prosecuted some persons for involvement in such
 recruiting activities. During the year, law enforcement agencies conducted several
 raids of entertainment establishments accused of fostering prostitution.
 The Constitution provides for equal rights for women, and the Lao Women's
 Union operates nationally to promote the position of women in Lao society. How-
 ever, discrimination against women is not generalized. There persist varying de-
 grees of traditional culturally based discrimination, with greater discrimination
 practiced among some hill tribs. Many women occupy responsible positions in the
 civil service andprivate business, and in urban areas their incomes are often higher
 than those of men. The Family Code prohibits legal discrimination in marriage and
 inheritance.
 The Government has increased support for the Women in Development Program,
 which is designed in part to increase the participation of women in the political sys-
 tem.
 Children.--Government resources are inadequate to provide fully for children's
 basic health and educational needs. Education is compulsory through the fifth
 grade, but children from rural areas and poor urban families rarely comply with this
 requirement. Violence against children is prohibited by law. Reports of the physical
 abuse of children are rare.
 The Government is increasingly concerned about Lao childrei{ being lured for sex-
 ual exploitation and slave labor in other countries and has established a National
 Commission on Mothers and Children chaired by the foreign minister. The commis-
 sion, working with the Lao Women's Union, Youth Union, Justice Ministry and
 Labor Ministry, has conducted workshops around the country designed to make par-
 ents and teenagers aware of the dangers.
 People With Disabilities.-With donor assistance, the Government is implement-
 ing limited programs for the disabled, especially amputees. The law does not man-
 date accessibility to buildings or government services for disabled persons.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-The Constitution provides for equal rights
 for all minorities, and there is no legal discrimination against them. However, soci-
 etal discrimination persists.
 Approximately half the population is ethnic Lao, also called "lowland Lao." Most
 of Ye remainder is a mosaic of diverse upland hill tribes whose members, if born
 in Laos, are Lao citizens. There are also ethnic Vietnamese and Chinese minorities,
 
 
 particularly in the towns. There is a small community of South Asian origin. The
 implementation in 1994 of the 1990 Law on Nationality provided a means for these
 Vietnamese and Chinese minorities to regularize their Lao citizenship. The Govern-
 ment encourages the preservation of minority cultures and traditions; however, due
 to remote location and difficult access, minority tribes have little voice in govern-
 ment decisions affecting their lands and the allocation of natural resources. Hill
 tribe interaction with the Government is limited by poor transportation and commu-
 nication links and a shortage of government resources.
 The Hmong are one of the largest and most prominent highland minority groups.
 They split along clan lines during the U.S. war with Vietnam; many were strongly
 anti-Communist while others sided with the Lao and Vietnamese Communists. in
 the 1970's and 1980's the Government repressed many who had fought against it
 prior to 1975, especially those that it perceived to be resisting its authority. The
 Government continued to assist citizens, largely members of ethnic minorities, who
 returned to Laos after having fled following the war in Indochina ending in 1975.
 Central and local government officials wbrked with international organizations to
 provide land and a sustainable level of economic security.
 In recent years, the Government has initiated projects designed to integrate the
 Hmong into the general society, and an increasing number of those who fled the
 country after 1975 have repatriated to Laos without suffering persecution. Two U.N.
 observers who monitored repatriation efforts reported no incidents of abuse or dis-
 crimination during the year.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Although the Constitution provides citizens with the
 right to organize and join associations, the party controls all associations, and all
 conform to official party policy (see Section 2.b.).
 Subsistence farmers comprise an estimated 85 percent of the work force. The
 State employs the majority of salaried workers, although this situation is changing
 as the Government reduces the number of its employees and privatizes state enter-
 rises, and as foreign investors open new factories and businesses. Under the 1990
 Labor Code, labor unions can be formed in private enterprises as long as they oper-
 ate within the framework of the officially sanctioned Federation of Lao Trade
 Unions (FLTU), which in turn is controlled by the LPRP. Most of the FLTU's 80,000
 members work in the public sector, overwhelmingly as public servants.
 Strikes are not prohibited under the law, but the Government's ban on "desta-
 bilizing subversive activities" makes a strike unlikely, and none was reported this
 year (see Section 2.a.).
 With advice from the International Labor Organization (ILO), including a foreign
 expert provided by the ILO to work with the Ministry of Labor and Social Welfare,
 the Government has revised the Labor Code in an effort to clarify rights and obliga-
 tions of workers and employers.
 The extent to which the FLTU is free to engage in contacts and affiliate with for-
 eign labor organizations is unknown.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-There is no right to organize
 and bargain collectively. The Labor Code stipulates that disputes be resolved
 through workplace committees composed of employers, representatives of the local
 labor union, and representatives of the FLTU, with final authority residing in the
 Ministry of Labor and Social Welfare. Labor disputes are infrequent. The Govern-
 ment sets wages and salaries for government employees, while management sets
 wages and salaries for private business employees.
 The Labor Code stipulates that employers may not fire employees for conducting
 trade union activities, for lodging complaints against employers about labor law im-
 plementation, or for cooperating with officials on labor law implementation and
 at r disputes. Workplace committees are one mechanism used for resolving com-
 plaints.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Labor Code prohibits forced
 labor except in time of war or national disaster, when the State may conscript labor-
 ers. The code also applies to children under age 15, and the law is effectively en-
 forced. However, an increasing number of children have been lured into other coun-
 tries for sexual exploitation and slave labor (see Section 6.d.).
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The Labor Code prohibits forced
 labor, including labor performed by children under age 15, and the law is effectively
 enforced (see Section 6.c.). Under the Code, children under the age of 15 may not
 be recruited for employment. However, many children help their families on farms
 or in shops. The Labor Code accordingly provides that children may work for their
 families, provided that such children are not engaged in dangerous or difficult work.
 
 
 Such employment of children is common in urban shops, but rare in industrial en-
 terprises. The Ministries of Interior and-Justice are responsible for enforcing these
 provisions, but enforcement is ineffective due to a lack of inspectors and other re-
 sources. Education is compulsory through the fifth grade, but this requirement is
 rarely observed in the rural areas or among the urban poor.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The Labor Code provides for a broad range of
 worker entitlements, including a workweek limited to 48 hours (36 in dangerous ac-
 tivities), safe working conditions, and higher compensation for dangerous work. The
 code also provides for at least 1 day of rest per week. Employers are responsible
 for all expenses for a worker injured or killed on the job, a requirement generally
 fulfilled by employers in the formal economic sector. The daily minimum wage is
 $0.75 (1,400 kip), which is insufficient to provide a decent standard of living for a
 worker and family. Most civil servants receive inadequate pay. However, few fami-
 lies in the wage economy depend on only one breadwinner. Some piecework employ-
 ees, especially on construction sites, earn less than the minimum wage. Many are
 illegal immigrants, particularly from Vietnam, and are more vulnerable to exploi-
 tation by employers. Although workplace inspections have reportedly increased, the
 Ministry of Labor and Social Welfare lacks the personnel and budgetary resources
 to enforce the Labor Code effectively. The Labor Code has no specific provision al-
 lowing workers to remove themselves from a dangerous situation without jeopardiz-
 ing their employment.
