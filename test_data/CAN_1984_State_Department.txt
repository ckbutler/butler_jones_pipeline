 CANADA
 Canada is a constitutional monarchy in the British
 Commonwealth with a bilingual federal system, parliamentary
 form of government, and strong democratic traditions. By
 universal suffrage, voters elect representatives in the
 multiparty political system at local, provincial, and national
 levels. Under Canada's decentralized federal structure,
 specific governmental'responsibilities are reserved either to
 the provinces or to the Federal Government. Each has
 substantial autonomy in its respective areas of competence.
 Religious tolerance and freedom of worship are fundamental to
 Canadian culture. The diverse ethnic and cultural makeup
 complements vigorous economic and political pluralism. The
 media freely express a wide spectrum of opinion. Generally,
 women participate fully in Canadian society, but there is
 growing awareness of diverse residual inequalities,
 particularly economic, which inhibit parity in some
 opportunities and benefits available to men. Also, the
 Federal and provincial governments continue deliberations with
 Canada's native peoples to address recognized longstanding
 imbalances in the rights and privileges of those groups.
 Respect for fundamental human rights in Canada is based on the
 well-established principle of the rule of law. It is
 entrenched in the Constitution and expressed in numerous
 Federal and provincial laws which reflect Canadian political,
 cultural, and social practices. The Charter of Rights and
 Freedoms, added to Canada's revised Constitution in 1982,
 guarantees fundamental rights to everyone. The Parliament or
 provincial legislatures may enact limited exceptions to
 certain Charter provisions for up to 5 years (renewable for
 another 5). Otherwise, the Charter places basic human rights
 beyond the reach of ordinary legislative action. Although its
 long-range impact is yet to be determined, the Charter
 generally is regarded as fulfilling its promise to protect and
 extend essential rights and liberties. Resort to adjudication
 by the courts is growing more frequent in instances where
 infringements are perceived.
 Also on the Federal level, statutes such as the Canadian Bill
 of Rights and the Human Rights Act prohibit discriminatory
 practices in a broad range of social and economic activities
 and protect fundamental political and legal civil liberties.
 However, several statutes, such as the War Measures Act,
 permit some abridgments of human rights guarantees under
 special circumstances and have yet to be tested in the
 courts.
 The security services were reorganized in 1984 as the result
 of an investigation which uncovered illegal activities
 infringing certain protected civil liberties. Canada's armed
 forces are under the authority of the elected civilian
 government and have no role in domestic law enforcement.
 The Canadian public and the media are quick to react to any
 real or suspected encroachment on basic freedoms, not only in
 Canada but throughout the world. Canada has played a leading
 role in stimulating global concern over human rights abuses
 and in working to strengthen international human rights
 machinery. In 1985, Canada will host the Human Rights Experts
 Meeting of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in

 CANADA
 Europe. Traditionally a place of refuge for victims of
 oppression in other parts of the world, Canada has welcomed
 large numbers of refugees in addition to contributing
 substantial sums for humanitarian assistance.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There was no politically motivated killing, either by the
 Government or its domestic opposition, in 1984. Political
 violence is rare in Canada. Armenian terrorists, however,
 claimed credit for the attempted assassination of a Turkish
 diplomat in April 1982 and for the murder of the Turkish
 military attache in Ottawa in August 1982. Suspects in the
 earlier incident were arrested in March 1984, but the
 perpetrators of the latter murder have not yet been identified.
 b. Disappearance
 Secret arrest, clandestine detention, and politically motivated
 'disappearances' do not take place in Canada.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Legal prohibition of these abuses is respected in practice.
 Prison conditions generally meet accepted standards. However,
 Amnesty International in April 1983 investigated allegations
 of prisoner torture and mistreatment after a 1982 riot in a
 Federal prison in Quebec. In June 1983, the organization
 submitted a memorandum to the Canadian Government calling for
 a full, impartial, independent investigation of the
 allegations, and the Government undertook an inquiry. Amnesty
 concluded in March 1984 that there existed 'reasonable ground
 to believe" that the guards at the facility may have tortured
 or mistreated some prisoners. The result of the Government's
 inquiry is not yet known.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The Constitution, subject to override provisions, prohibits
 arbitrary detention and imprisonment. A person has the right
 to be informed promptly of reasons for his arrest or detention
 and to retain counsel without delay. Habeas corpus exists and
 is honored. Accused persons are generally released pending
 trial. There are provisions for judicial review at specified
 intervals in pretrial detention cases.
 The War Measures Act of 1914, augmented by a 1981 Federal
 Cabinet order, permits a declaration of a state of emergency
 with suspension of certain basic civil liberties in the event
 of war or peacetime crisis. The 1939 Official Secrets Act,
 which prohibits the private possession, distribution, and
 publication of information deemed prejudicial to the interests
 of the state, provides that individuals under suspicion may be
 arrested without a warrant.

 CANADA
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 In civil as well as criminal matters, the presumption of
 innocence and the right to a public trial are fundamental
 features of the Canadian legal system. Defendants have the
 right to counsel of their choice. Persons charged with
 criminal offenses under Federal law may generally take
 advantage of provincial legal aid programs subsidized by the
 Federal Government. These rights and protections are
 respected in practice. There is, however, public concern over
 increasing court docket backlogs which are causing long delays
 in some instances.
 The judiciary is an independent branch of government. Judges
 are appointed by either the Federal or provincial government,
 depending on the level and jurisdiction of the court. Secure
 tenure of judges and standards set by provincial law societies
 contribute to judicial independence and impartiality.
 The Official Secrets Act allows for trials under its provisions
 to be held in camera and includes presumption in favor of the
 state, although two of the three prosecutions in the last 5
 years were resolved in favor of the defendants, and the one
 conviction was later overturned.
 The 1970 Federal Court Act allows a Cabinet minister to deny
 release of certain categories of information, even if necessary
 for a person's defense in court.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Criminal Code prohibits forcible entry into a person's
 home. If a police officer, when not authorized to do so by
 law, conducts a search without a warrant, he becomes an
 intruder and is subject to legal penalties. The Charter of
 Rights and Freedoms also guarantees security against
 unreasonable search or seizure, subject to the exception
 provisions noted above.
 Upon petition of the Federal Court of Canada and with
 sufficient justification, a law enforcement official may be
 granted a 'Writ of Assistance," which empowers the official
 with due cause to enter and search premises without a specific
 warrant. The writ, usually issued under the Narcotics Control
 Act, is nonspecific and openended, empowering the particular
 law enforcement officer to act without a precise warrant
 throughout his career. A moratorium on issuance of such writs
 was imposed in 1976, but some remain in force. Considerable
 public discussion has taken place on possibly altering the
 terms of reference of the writs or abolishing them altogether.
 According to official inquiries, some abuses of personal
 privacy, including surreptitious entry and the monitoring of
 telephones and mail, have occurred in the past decade. After
 public debate, the Government recently restructured and
 altered the mandate of the security services in an effort to
 avert such abuses.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution guarantees freedom of speech and press.
 
 
 937
 CANADA
 Viewpoints representing the complete political spectrum are
 argued vigorously in the press, on radio, and television. In
 most radio and television broadcasts, the majority of the
 content is required to be of Canadian origin. Subsidized
 postal rates for Canadian publications provide them an
 advantage over foreign-owned publications printed and mailed
 in Canada and those printed abroad and brought into Canada for
 mailing. Some provinces maintain boards with authority to
 delete sexually explicit or violent material from films for
 distribution. Court decisions based on the new Charter have
 called into question some methods of censorship but have not
 found the practice unconstitutional in principle.
 In the political sphere, during parliamentary sessions, daily
 debates and question periods are televised nationwide. A
 similar practice is followed by some provinces.
 In July 1983, a Freedom of Information Act came into force,
 establishing procedures for public access to certain
 government records. For the most part the measure has been
 widely welcomed, but there is some criticism of the exemption
 authority, which accords the Government substantial discretion
 to prevent release of information.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Canadian Constitution guarantees freedom of peaceful
 assembly and association *subject only to such reasonable
 limits prescribed by law as can be demonstrably justified in a
 free and democratic society.' Associations representing a
 full range of political opinion may organize and espouse their
 views freely.
 Canadian labor unions represent 40 percent of the
 non-agricultural work force and enjoy wide freedom of action.
 Canadian law recognizes the right of labor in both the public
 and private sectors to organize, associate freely, bargain
 collectively, and strike. These rights are well established
 and recognized in practice, although the Federal Government
 and several provinces, citing economic circumstances, have
 passed legislation which limits somewhat the collective
 bargaining rights of public sector employees. Federal and
 provincial legislation proscribe discrimination in union
 membership recruitment and employee hiring. The union
 movement is politically involved and plays an important role
 in society and the economy. Many Canadian labor unions are
 affiliated internationally and participate actively in the
 International Labor Organization and similar world bodies.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Tne Constitution recognizes the fundamental freedom of
 conscience and religion. There is no established religion.
 All faiths enjoy freedom of worship and religious expression.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Canadian citizens and permanent residents can travel in and
 outside the country, leave, and reenter. The Charter of
 Rights and Freedoms in the new Constitution strengthens the
 right of citizens and permanent residents to establish
 residence in any province and to take up employment there.
 
 
 938
 CANADA
 Canada is a principal haven for refugees and has taken a major
 role in focusing international attention on the causes of
 refugee problems. Private citizens and voluntary
 organizations play a large part in Canadian refugee programs
 alongside government-supported activities. New arrivals enjoy
 virtually all rights and privileges of Canadians and, after a
 period in permanent resident status, may become citizens and
 thereby obtain the right to vote.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Overall governing authority at the Federal level is vested in
 the House of Commons, whose members are elected by secret
 ballot through universal suffrage of Canadian citizens 18
 years and older, and in a Senate appointed by the Governor
 General, Queen Elizabeth II's representative as Chief of
 State. In practice, power is exercised by the Prime Minister
 and the Cabinet, who usually are elected members of the
 Commons. The Government, under constant scrutiny by the
 elected political opposition, vigilant media, and public
 interest groups, is held accountable for its actions by
 Parliament and, ultimately, the electorate through the
 democratic process. Elections for the 282 single-member
 constituencies must be held at least every 5 years, and
 participation rates are high. In the 1984 general election,
 over 12.5 million Canadians exercised their franchise (76
 percent of those eligible to vote).
 All Canadians have complete freedom to participate actively in
 the political process. Three politically diverse parties are
 represented in the House of Commons, and several others
 function at the provincial level. All provinces and
 territories have similar freely elected legislatures.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Canada has vigorously supported efforts to increase the
 authority of international bodies to investigate and deal with
 human rights abuses and plays a major role in the UN
 Commission on Human Rights.
 The Canadian Human Rights Commission, established under the
 1977 Human Rights Act, is charged with investigating and
 resolving complaints of discrimination in government and
 business activities under Federal jurisdiction and combatting
 discrimination through information, education, and research.
 The Canadian Human Rights Act aims at improving protection of
 disabled persons and at tightening provisions against
 harassment of women. The Commission continues to advocate
 changes in legislation affecting indigenous peoples. Each
 province maintains a similar Human Rights Commission. Because
 these commissions are becoming overburdened, there is growing
 concern that individuals face long delays for the resolution
 of. complaints.
 A Federal-provincial committee of officials responsible for
 human rights provides- a forum for intergovernmental discussion
 of matters related to'human rights in Canada. Canada's
 Commissioner of Official Languages reviews public complaints
 over violations in statutory language rights which guarantee
 
 
 939
 CANADA
 Canadians the right to deal with Federal institutions in
 either French or English.
 Non-governmental human rights organizations and interest
 groups actively follow human rights issues in Canada and
 abroad. The prominent role occupied by human rights
 considerations in Canada's external relations was reinforced
 in the March 1984 Annual Conference on Foreign Policy and
 Human Rights, sponsored by the Canadian Human Rights
 Foundation and attended by senior government officials and
 private experts from across the country and abroad. In May
 1985, Ottawa will host the Human Rights Experts Meeting, a
 follow-up to the Conference on Security and Cooperation in
 Europe, which will review the implementation of provisions on
 human rights. Amnesty International's 1984 report notes its
 concern about the possible torture or mistreatment of
 prisoners (see Section l.c.). Freedom House rates Canada
 "free.'
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 Food, shelter, health care, and education are available to all
 Canadians regardless of race, religion, sex, ethnic background,
 or political opinion. Successive Canadian governments have
 demonstrated a strong commitment to improving the lot of the
 poor. Federal and provincial governments administer extensive
 social welfare programs for which all Canadians qualify,
 regardless of income. The Federal Department of Employment
 and Immigration administers a comprehensive program of
 unemployment insurance compensation which provides old age
 security payments to more than 2 million Canadians over the
 age of 65. An equalization system provides for transfers of
 revenue from the more prosperous provinces to those which are
 relatively less well-off. Education is free up to grade 13,
 and all Canadians are covered by a national medical and health
 insurance program. In 1984, the infant mortality rate was 8.0
 per 1,000 live births, and life expectancy at birth was 75.1
 years. Canada's per capita gross national product in 1982 was
 $11,321 for a population of 25,142,000.
 Women are increasingly active in Canadian political life.
 They participate fully in political parties and are
 represented in Parliament and provincial legislatures,
 although not in numbers proportionate to the population in
 most cases. A record 28 were elected to Parliament in the
 1984 election. A Cabinet Minister is charged specifically
 with responsibility for the status of women. A Federal
 Advisory Council on the Status of Women, consisting of women
 with distinguished records in business, government, and social
 service, advises the Minister of Women's Affairs on measures
 to promote sexual equality within the public service and in
 Federal legislation. The new Charter of Rights and Freedoms
 contains a clause specifying that all its provisions pertain
 equally to men and women.
 Nevertheless, entrenched systemic inequities affecting women
 are of increasing concern to Canadians and their Government.
 For example, a recently released Federal Government report
 indicates that women employed full time earned an average of
 64 cents for every dollar earned by men in 1982. Although
 this figure represents an improvement over 1967, when female
 workers received only 58 cents for each dollar paid to their
 male counterparts, such statistics have led to serious public
 
 
 940
 CANADA
 debates over policies to achieve wage parity and assure equal
 opportunity throughout the economy.
 Much emphasis has been placed on the fostering of a bilingual
 multicultural society in which all may enjoy freedom from
 discrimination while maintaining distinct cultural identities
 within Canada. The Official Languages Act of 1969 declared
 English and French to be equal in status, rights, and
 privileges in all Federal institutions. The new Constitution
 ensures that most Canadians belonging to either of the
 official language groups have the right to educate their
 children in that language wherever numbers warrant. A
 Minister for multiculturalism is responsible specifically for
 encouraging the expression of the heritage of ethnic groups
 and protecting the cultural diversity of Canadian society.
 Quebec repeatedly has invoked the *reasonable limits' and
 exemption clauses of the Federal Constitution in an effort to
 ensure that the province's own laws and Bill of Rights take
 precedence. The Quebec Government also retains the power to
 suspend the Bill of Rights' extensive list of liberties and
 rights.
 In July 1984, Canada's Supreme Court upheld a lower court
 ruling overturning portions of a Quebec provincial law which
 the court determined restricted the education and mobility
 rights of English-speaking students. The decision, which
 hinged on the "reasonable limits' to fundamental freedoms
 versus individual rights, marks the first major test of the
 new Constitution. Other provisions of the Quebec law,
 including sections prohibiting English-language advertising or
 use of English in the workplace, remain in force and also have
 generated controversy.
 Other primarily English-speaking provinces have debated the
 applicability and implementation of the established Federal
 policy of bilingualism. The Manitoba Government encountered
 heavy resistance in its unsuccessful attempt to reestablish
 French language rights in the provincial constitution this
 past year The issue now is under review by Canada's Supreme
 Court.
 The 1982 Constitution specifically *recognized the existing
 aboriginal and treaty rights of the aboriginal peoples of
 Canada' without going into further detail. Furthermore, the
 Charter of Rights and Freedoms provides that its guarantees
 shall not be construed so as to derogate from aboriginal
 rights and freedoms previously recognized or acquired in land
 claims settlements. Constitutional conferences which included
 representatives of aboriginal peoples were held in March 1983
 and March 1984 to deal with the question of which native
 rights should be constitutionally protected. More such
 meetings are scheduled.
 The Canadian Human Rights Commission has recommended steps to
 end sexual discrimination in existing legislation which denies
 Indian status (the right to tribal membership, and related
 benefits) to native women who marry non-Indian men. At
 present, the Federal Government is able to exempt from this
 denial of status only those Indian tribes which make a
 specific request for dispensation. According to a report of
 the Department of Indian and Northern Affairs, native peoples
 as a group have less access to social benefits provided by the
 Government and suffer traditional social problems more deeply
 
 
 941
 CANADA
 than the mainstream of the population. Indians obtained the
 franchise in Federal elections in 1960 and in the provinces
 during the 1950's and 1960's.
 A section of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, due to take
 effect in 1985 and subject to override provisions, guarantees
 equal benefits and protection of the law without discrimination
 based on race, national or ethnic origin, color, religion,
 sex, age, or mental or physical disability. The delay in
 entering into force is to allow the Federal and provincial
 governments time to review and adjust existing practices and
 statutes.
