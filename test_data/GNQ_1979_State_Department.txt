 EQUATORIAL GUINEA
 The dictatorship of former President Macias was over-
 thrown in an August 1979 military coup following eleven
 years of highly repressive rule, marked by systematic and
 widespread abuses of human rights. The officers who
 mounted the coup were all either part of the Macias gov-
 ernment or had served in the armed forces during his
 regime. Many of those involved in the coup and in the
 new government had suffered personally from the excesses
 of the former regime. Some had been jailed, banished to
 their villages or had lost close relatives, as had
 Lieutenant Colonel Nguema, who as Deputy Defense Minister,
 led the August coup.
 Since assuming power, President Nguema and other members
 of his government have made clear through repeated public
 declarations that the new government is committed to the
 principles of international law, adherence to the UN and
 OAU charters, restoration of democracy and respect for
 human rights. Immediately following the coup, the new
 government decreed an amnesty for all political prisoners
 and later declared a general amnesty for all Guineans in
 exile for political reasons.  Former President Macias
 was charged with various crimes including genocide, mass
 murder, peculation, treason, and systematic human rights
 violations. He was convicted in a public trial under
 Spanish law, which was attended by foreign observers,
 including a representative of the International Commission
 of Jurists (ICJ). Following the trial he was executed.
 The Commission later declared the trial was as fair and
 equitable as could be expected in light of the excep-
 tional circumstances which prevailed in Equatorial Guinea
 after the coup d'etat, noting that there had been no
 system of criminal law in operation during the Macias
 regime.
 The new government appears to be operating in a judicial
 void, having adopted neither the previous constitutions
 of 1968 or 1973, nor a new constitution. The government
 has indicated that the present legal framework is a com-
 bination of Spanish law and local custom. The conduct
 of civil affairs is also covered by decree laws, decrees,
 orders circulars, and proclamations issued since August
 by national, provincial and local government within the
 guidelines enunciated by the new President. The popu-
 lace appears to be virtually unrestricted in its enjoy-
 ment of basic freedoms and the general atmosphere is
 relaxed and open, at least as observed in Malabo and
 Bata.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 The new government has guaranteed "physical integrity of
 persons" and the "inviolability of all Guinean citizens."
 We have no evidence that torture, frequently used by
 the former regime, is still used in Equatorial Guinea.
 During his imprisonment until the September 1979 trial,
 Macias was well treated, according to observers. President
 
 
 63
 Nguema stated in the independence anniversary speech on
 October 12, 1979 that "no one must suffer slavery, tor-
 ture or cruel, degrading or inhuman treatment."
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 There is no evidence of such treatment or punishment by
 the new regime, as contrasted with the barbaric record of
 its predecessor. Macias and six of his collaborators
 were executed on September 29, 1979 after a public trial,
 which was described by observers as fair. Four other
 defendants were sentenced to prison terms of from four
 to 14 years. Since the health and dietary-needs of the
 people of Equatorial Guinea are not currently adequately
 met, prison conditions are presumably rudimentary.
 c. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 There is ample evidence to indicate that the Macias
 regime indiscriminately arrested and imprisoned hundreds
 if not thousands of Equatorial Guineans. The new gov-
 ernment has announced the release of all political pris-
 oners held by the previous regime, and asserts that it
 is currently detaining no political prisoners. There
 are no indications that the new regime practices arbi-
 trary arrest and imprisonment, and President Nguema
 stated in his Independence Day anniversary speech that
 "no one should be arbitrarily detained, made prisoner or
 exiled."
 d. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Macias and those defendants tried with him were given a
 public trial, provided with counsel, and were informed
 of the charges against them. The tribunal was composed
 of three military and two civilian members, who applied
 Spanish law. This trial is thus far the only basis for
 a judgment of judicial procedures in Equatorial Guinea
 under the new government. As of December 1979, the
 present government has not established a court system or
 reformed legal codes and procedures.
 e. Invasion of the Home
 In a public address on August 5, 1979, President Nguema
 stated that the new government would guarantee the
 "inviolability of the home," and there is no reason to
 believe that this guarantee has been violated.
 2. Govermental Policies Relating to the Fulfillment
 of Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care
 and Education
 Effective government administration and the modern sector
 of the Equatorial Guinean economy had virtually ceased
 to exist during the latter years of the Macias regime.
 Cocoa production, once the main-stay of the economy and
 the major foreign exchange earner, declined from about
 40,000 tons at independence in 1968 to about 8,000 tons
 in 1978, as the Macias regime made life intolerable for
 land holders and laborers alike, many of whom were for-
 eigners. The government seized many private land hold-
 ings, nationalizing some and turning the remainder over
 
 
 64
 to Macias' political supporters. Coffee production fol-
 lowed a similar pattern as a result of official misman-
 agement and neglect following expropriation of planta-
 tions. The nation's banking system virtually ceased
 functioning and became Macias' personal treasury. Trade
 became the monopoly of the state. Nearly all imports
 came from China, under terms of a commercial and assist-
 ance agreement, and were sold through state-owned stores.
 The new government has declared itself in favor of the
 liberalization of commerce. It has stated its intention
 to develop a mixed economy, with an important role for
 free enterprise. Even so, Equatorial Guinea faces the
 challenge of complete national reconstruction, not only
 of its economy but of its educational and health services
 as well. By decree in March 1975, former President
 Macias suppressed private education. He prohibited the
 Catholic Church from engaging in education, and arrested
 Catholic priests and nuns. At the same time, Macias
 introduced "revolutionary political training" as the
 standard for public education. Though i boasted a high
 literacy rate at the time of independence, Equatorial
 Guinea now has a younger generation which has lost at
 least five years of education. By the time former
 President Macias was overthrown, the country's medical
 system had ceased to function.
 Only minimal medical care was being provided by a hand-
 ful of foreign and Equatorial Guinean doctors. Though it
 once had one of the highest per capita incomes in Africa,
 Equatorial Guinea is now virtually bankrupt and dependent
 upon external assistance as it undertakes the task of
 national reconstruction.
 3. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties Includ-
 ing:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and
 Assembly
 While Decree Law No. 11 of November 24 makes specific
 reference to the "right of information," freedom of
 speech has yet to be tested because there are no media
 for public expression except the Government-owned radio
 stations in Malabo and Bata, and TV station in Malabo.
 Newspapers ceased to exist under Macias and have not yet
 been revived because of the lack of resources. An August
 1979 decree authorized reopening of churches of all re-
 ligions recognized in Equatorial Guinea. Churches are
 again functioning and members of religious groups are
 beginning to return to Equatorial Guinea. The new Gov-
 ernment has not made specific commitments on other civil
 and political liberties, but it has warned returning
 refugees, an estimated 50,000 to 100,000 of whom fled
 during the Macias regime, that political factionalism
 will not be tolerated.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel and Emigration
 President Nguema has announced that freedom of movement
 has been reestablished. There are no known restrictions
 on travel within Equatorial Guinea. Travel abroad is
 
 
 65
 limited by the shortage of foreign exchange, and lack
 of transportation. All Guineans in exile have been
 invited by a general amnesty decreed in October "to
 return without concern for being persecuted or punished
 for having abandoned Equatorial Guinea."
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 The new military government of Equatorial Guinea is au-
 thoritarian in nature, i.e., it rules by decree. The
 President and all cabinet members are military officers,
 as are the governors of both provinces. Government min-
 istries are staffed by civilians. Despite its commitment
 to restore democracy, the government has indicated that
 political parties and activities will not be permitted
 until progress has been achieved toward national economic
 reconstruction. The military government has set no
 timetable for the return to constitutional rule. Women
 appear to be free to participate in social, economic and
 governmental affairs. While there are no women at senior
 government levels, there is one woman mayor and women
 serve in a number of working level government positions.
 There is no functioning trade union movement at this time
 in Equatorial Guinea.
 4. Government Attitude and Record Regarding Inter-
 national and'Non-governmental Investigations of
 Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The new government invited representatives of the
 International Commission of Jurists to attend the trial
 of former President Macias, and invited the United
 Nations Human Rights Commission to evaluate the current
 human rights situation in Equatorial Guinea. The
 International Commission of Jurists' report on the Macias
 trial was issued in Geneva in December 1979. A dele-
 gation from the United Nations Human Rights Commission
 visited Equatorial Guinea in November 1979 and is pre-
 paring a report which is scheduled to be issued early in
 1980.
