 BAHRAIN
 Bahrain has been ruled by the extended family of the
 Al-Khalifa, which dominates its society and Government, since
 the late 18th century. The Amir, who is confirmed by the
 Constitution as hereditary ruler, governs Bahrain with the
 assistance of his brother, the Prime Minister, and an
 appointed cabinet of ministers. The Government has suspended
 some provisions of Bahrain's 1973 Constitution, including
 those articles relating to the National Assembly which the
 Government disbanded in 1975. There are few judicial checks
 on the Amir and his Government.
 The Ministry of Interior is responsible for public security,
 and has a large and effective police force, numbering about
 2,500, at.its disposal.
 Bahrain's leaders seek to foster the open social and
 commercial environment needed to attract international
 business while protecting the ruling family's preeminence,
 preventing sectarian violence, and thwarting externally
 inspired subversion. The economy has benefited from the
 region's economic boom over the last two decades and the gross
 domestic product is growing at about 5 percent annually.
 Bahrainis are divided between Shi'a and Sunni sects of Islam,
 the Shi'a sects comprising over two-thirds of the population.
 The ruling family is Sunni, and the Sunni community tends to
 be wealthier and more influential than the Shi'a, although
 there are exceptions. While extreme poverty is rare and the
 Government attempts to assure full employment, the Shi'a as a
 group are disadvantaged, a situation which adds to the
 potential for externally inspired subversion. Two clandestine
 political groups with links to Iran have drawn support from
 some Shi'a, ana two underground, secular, leftist groups
 advocate violent political change. There has also been an
 increase in the number of groups supporting Iranian-inspired
 Islamic fundamentalism.
 There was little change in the human rights situation in
 1988. Civil liberties remained restricted, and there were
 continuing reports of arrests for antiregime political
 activities.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There were no known political killings.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no known disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Torture is prohibited by law, and there is no evidence of a
 policy of systematic physical mistreatment of criminal
 offenders. However, Amnesty International (AI), in its 1988
 Report covering 1987, noted that it had received allegations
 of torture in Bahrain and cited the case of 18 alleged members
 
 
 1288
 BAHRAIN
 of the banned Bahrain National Liberation Front (BNLF) who
 were tried in 1986 and 1987 on charges of supporting the
 BNLF. AI reported that the defendants alleged in court that
 they had been held incommunicado for several months after
 their arrest and had been forced to make confessions under
 torture. According to AI, an examination by a forensic
 medical doctor found, in some cases, scarring on the bodies of
 the accused consistent with the type and timing of torture
 alleged. Al also noted that basic safeguards against torture
 were lacking. Although there were allegations, there were no
 confirmed reports of torture in 1988.
 In the past, persons suspected of security offenses have
 suffered physical abuse at the hands of individual
 interrogators while detained or under arrest; a few have
 reportedly died in prison under unexplained circumstances.
 There are no reliable reports about what happens during
 detention in security prisons (where questioning may continue
 after sentencing) since visits by nongovernment persons are
 generally prohibited. Medical examinations by nonprison
 doctors have also been denied.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Political activity is tightly controlled by the security
 forces, and persons are sometimes detained arbitrarily on
 suspicion of antiregime activity. Activities that could lead,
 under provisions of the security law, to questioning,
 warnings, or arrest include membership in subversive, illegal
 organizations, painting antiregime slogans on walls, joining
 antigovernment demonstrations, possessing or circulating
 antiregime writings, preaching sermons with a radical
 political tone, or harboring or associating with persons
 committing such acts. In the past, detainees have sometimes
 been held incommunicado for lengthy periods, although family
 members can usually learn of a detainee's whereabouts.
 Confessions are common following such prolonged periods of
 incommunicado detention. It was alleged that several children
 were detained and held incommunicado by security forces after
 the 1988 'Ashura celebration (a Shi'a religious observance),
 during which an antigovernment demonstration took place. The
 children were reported to have been released after 24 hours in
 custody.
 Persons imprisoned for political offenses are sometimes
 released on the condition that they immediately go into
 exile. With regard to a discussion of forced or compulsory
 labor, see Section 6.c.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 A person arrested may be tried in either a civil court or the
 Security Court. Civil trials provide procedural guarantees,
 including open trial, the right to counsel (with legal aid
 available to indigents), and the right to appeal. Security
 cases, however, are tried directly by the Supreme Court of
 Appeal, sitting as the Security Court. Trials are held in
 secret, there is no right to judicial review of the legality
 of arrests, and the court is exempted from adhering to the
 procedural guarantees of the penal code. Sentences imposed by
 the Security Court can, at the discretion of the court, be
 referred to the Amir for clemency, a procedure not customarily
 followed in civil court cases.
 
 
 1289
 BAHRAIN
 The Bahrain Defense Force maintains a separate court system
 for military personnel accused of offenses under the military
 code. These courts do not review cases involving civilian
 criminal or security offenses. Reliable estimates indicate
 that fewer than 50 persons are now being held for political
 reasons. AI estimated that there were over 100 political
 prisoners at the end of 1987.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Interior Ministry can authorize entry into private
 premises without judicial authorization. Telephone calls and
 correspondence are subject to monitoring. Police informer
 networks exist.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution provides for the right "to express and
 propagate opinions," but in practice Bahrainis cannot freely
 challenge the legitimacy of the regime in speech or writing.
 Political meetings are not permitted; gatherings which might
 take on a political tone are monitored through informers.
 Criticism of government policies and programs in such areas as
 municipal services, unemployment, and education is tolerated
 and commonly seen in the press.
 The Information Ministry exercises wide powers over the local
 media, and the press generally follows official policy
 closely. In the past, minor deviations have brought closure
 of the offerkding newspapers. There have been no closures
 since 1980, primarily because editors fully understand the
 limits of government tolerance. In 1988 local newspapers were
 given more leeway in their coverage, including criticism of
 the Government, than in the past. Bahrain is generally open
 to international media. The State owns all radio and
 television stations. All newspapers are privately owned but
 subject to government censorship. A former Information
 Ministry official serves as the editor of the only Arabic
 daily paper, which is regarded as semiofficial.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Although the Constitution affirms the right of free assembly,
 public political demonstrations or meetings are prohibited. A
 number of professional organizations exist, including groups
 of lawyers, physicians, engineers, and businessmen. The large
 number of soci~l and sports clubs have traditionally served as
 forums for discreet political discussion. Th Go-vernment
 monitors the activities of these organizations, which are
 generally small an& limited in scope.
 Permits must be obtained for meetings in public places.
 Permits for religious ceremonies, including Shi'a, are
 routinely granted. For a discussion of freedom of association
 as it applies to labor unions, see Section 6.a.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 The native population is overwhelmingly Muslim, and Islam is
 the state religion. Expatriate Christians and other
 non-Muslims, including Jews and Baha'is (15 percent of the
 population), maintain places of worship and enjoy considerable
 
 
 1290
 BAHRAIN
 freedom to practice their religion. Christian publications
 are readily available in bookstores, but proselytizing is not
 permitted.
 Both Sunni and Shi'a religious assemblies are subject to
 government control and monitoring, but there is no
 interference with routine worship or religious activities.
 Public religious events, most notably commemorative marches by
 members of the Shi'a community, are permitted but are closely
 watched by the police. There are restrictions on the number
 of Bahrainis permitted to make pilgrimages to Shila holy sites
 in Iran and Iraq. Religious study in Iran by Bahrain Shi'as
 is strongly discouraged.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Bahrainis are free to move within the country and change their
 place of residence or work. Passports for foreign travel can
 be denied on political grounds. Some persons living abroad
 and suspected of political offenses may face imprisonment
 without public trial upon return to Bahrain. Refugees are not
 repatriated to countries they have fled, but are obliged to
 depart Bahrain immediately. Some Iranian emigrees, who have
 fled Iran since 1979, have been permitted to remain in
 Bahrain, but they have not been granted citizenship. The
 Government discourages travel to Iran, especially by Shi'a.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Bahrain has no formal democratic institutiions. Consequently,
 most of its citizens do not have a say in the choice of
 leaders or in changing the political system. Bahrain is ruled
 by the Al-Khalifa family, headed by the Amir. All government
 positions are appointive. About one-third of the cabinet
 ministers are Shi'a, although they do not hold key
 portfolios. The average Bahraini citizen can attempt to
 influence government decisions only through the submission of
 written petitions and informal contact with senior officials,
 including through attendance at the Amir's frequent, regular
 public audiences. Neither political parties nor opposition
 organizations are permitted.
 There are four clandestine political groups that advocate
 violent revolution. The Islamic Front for the Liberation of
 Bahrain, the group responsible for the 1981 coup attempt, and
 the Islamic Call Party have ties to Iran and attract Shi'a
 support. Both call for the establishment of an Islamic
 Republic. Publid displays by their proponents increased
 during the year. This was caused, at least in part, by the
 emotions generated by the Palestinian intifada (uprising) in
 the occupied territories and by increased U.S. naval
 involvement in the Gulf. Two underground leftist groups, the
 Popular Front for the Liberation of Bahrain and the National
 Front for the Liberation of Bahrain, have ties with radical
 Arab regimes and the Soviet Union. Their influence in Bahrain
 appears to be on the decline.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 No internal human rights organizations exist. Representatives
 of AI visited Bahrain in 1987 and were received at high levels
 
 
 1291
 BAHRAIN
 within the Government. Following this visit, AI gave the
 Government a set of detailed recommendations about measures
 needed to protect human rights, and urged the Government to
 ratify major international human rights agreements.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Although there are notable exceptions, Sunni Muslims enjoy a
 more favored status than the Shi'a, who form approximately
 two-thirds of the population. Sunnis receive preference for
 employment in sensitive positions, including in the defense
 force and the managerial ranks of the public and private
 sectors. Statistics are unavailable but Shi'a tend to be
 employed in lower paid, lesser skilled jobs than Sunni
 workers. Social and municipal services in most Shi'a
 neighborhoods, particularly rural villages, are markedly
 inferior to those found in Sunni communities. The Government
 has tried to remedy social discrimination, improve Shi'a
 living conditions, and encourage sectarian integration through
 the development of government-subsidized housing complexes,
 open to all Bahrainis on the basis of financial need.
 Approximately one-third of the Amir's cabinet are of the Shi'a
 sect.
 Many legal rights of concern to women are subject to Islamic
 law. Specific rights vary according to Shi'a or Sunni
 precedent. In general, women have rights to their own
 property, but daughters receive a smaller inheritance than
 sons, and a widow must share her husband's estate with her
 children. Although a wife may obtain a divorce, she must
 specify grounds. A non-Muslim woman automatically loses
 custody of her children if she divorces a Muslim husband.
 Women must obtain the permission of the male head of the
 household to obtain a passport.
 With the development of the Bahrain economy, women have
 increasingly taken jobs previously reserved for men, and now
 constitute about 18 percent of the work force. The Government
 has enacted special laws to promote female entry into the work
 force, and is itself a leading employer of women. Most of
 their positions are clerical, but women hold some senior jobs,
 including the director of the Bahrain broadcasting service and
 the director of Bahrain's national museum. There are women's
 organizations which have as part of their agendas the
 objective of improving the status of women under both civil
 and Islamic law. These organizations are supported by the
 Government. Many women have traditional views of Islam and
 voluntarily adopt socially conservative roles.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 The Constitution recognizes the right of workers to organize.
 The Government has encouraged--and closely controlled--the
 formation of elected worker's committees in major companies.
 These committees now represent over 10 percent of the work
 force. The workers' committees choose members of a national
 committee. This body represents Bahraini workers in the
 International Labor Organization. Expatriate workers, about
 60 percent of the work force, are denied these limited
 association rights. There is no right to strike.
 
 
 1292
 BAHRAIN
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 Workers' representatives are empowered to discuss wages and
 working conditions with management.
 Mina Sulman, Bahrain's major port, provides a free transit
 zone to facilitate the duty-free import/export of equipment
 and machinery. Another free zone is located in the North
 Sitra Industrial Estate. The same labor laws, regulations,
 and practices apply in these zones as are in force elsewhere
 in Bahrain.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 The Government prohibits the use of forced or compulsory labor.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 The minimum age for employment is 14. Juveniles between the
 ages of 14 and 16 receive special protection under the labor
 laws. They may not be employed in hazardous conditions or
 work at night, and may not work over 6 hours per day or on a
 piecework basis. Child labor laws are enforced.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 Bahrain's labor law, enforced by the Ministry of Labor and
 Social Affairs, establishes acceptable conditions of work for
 all adult workers, including standards regarding minimum wages
 ($1.60 per hour), hours of work (maximum 48 hours per week)
 and occupational safety and health. Expatriate workers (60
 percent of the work force) are seriously disadvantaged by the
 requirement that all foreigners must be sponsored by Bahrainis
 in order to work. Under this system, sponsors can cancel the
 residence permit of any person under their sponsorship and
 blacklist individuals so that they cannot obtain entry or
 residence visas from another sponsor. Such power contains the
 inherent potential for exploitation, and foreign workers are
 often unwilling to report abuses for fear of forced
 repatriation. Bahrain's labor law does not recognize the
 concept of equal pay for equal work. Asian workers are often
 paid less than Bahrainis or Westerners with the same
 qualifications, and women are generally paid less than men.
