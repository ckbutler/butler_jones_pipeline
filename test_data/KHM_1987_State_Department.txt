 The human rights situation in Cambodia is profoundly affected
 by the ongoing struggle for political control, which began in
 December 1978 when theVietnamese army drove the Khmer Rouge
 Communist regime of Democratic Kampuchea out of Phnom Penh.
 Vietnam subsequently installed a puppet regime, the so-called
 People's Republic of Kampuchea (PRK), under former Khmer Rouge
 division commander Heng Samrin.- Vietnam, through the Heng
 Samrin regime and its own occupation forces, controls most of
 Cambodia by force of arms. Widespread abuses of hunlan rights
 in Cambodia stem largely from the occupation by at least 10
 Vietnamese army divisions and an indigenous Communist country-
 wide, civil-military control apparatus which together maintain
 the Heng Samrin regime in power. This control is challenged
 by a three-part Khmer resistance movement, the Coalition
 Government of Democratic Kampuchea (CGDK), which holds
 Cambodia's seat at the United Nations. The resistance has
 implemented a guerrilla strategy and conducts operations
 throughout niuch of Cambodia from areas along the Thai-Cambodian
 border.
 Vietnam has attempted to develop Cambodian political and
 economic institutions following the Vietnamese model. Power is
 restricted to the Communist Kampuchean People's Revolutionary
 Party (KPRP), which is controlled by the Communist party of
 Vietnam. Vietnam has declared that its army will leave
 Cambodia by 1990. However, growing dissatisfaction with the
 Vietnamese occupation and persistent PRK weakness make it
 unlikely that'th1e Heng Samrin regime for the foreseeable
 fu1ure will be able to sustain itself without Vietnamese
 troops.
 The CGDK was formed in 1982, when two non-Communist resistance
 (NCR) groups joined with the Khmer Rouge in a loose alliance.
 While in power from 1975-1979, the Khmer Rouge compiled one of
 the worst records of human rights violations in history as a
 result of a thorough and brutal attempt at restructuring Xhmer
 society., The number of-Cambodians who died as a result of
 such policies was probably at least 1 million. Despite claims
 to the contrary,- the Khmer Rouge top leadership front 1975-79
 remains in place. A number of recent incidents have been
 reported in which the Khmer Rouge acted with great brutality,
 and no reliable evidence exists that they have given up their
 ultimate goal of regaining power in Cambodia. The Khmer Rouge
 currently has between 40,000 and 50,000 men under arms.
 The Khmer People's National Liberation Front (KPNLF), which
 reportedly has approximately 7,000 armed men, is the older of
 the two NCR groups. It is led by former Prime Minister Son
 Sann and espouses a parliamentary form of government. It was
 formed in 1979 with the merger of several existing NCR groups,
 many led by former soldiers from the period of the pre-1975
 Khmer Republic. Lack of discipline in the KPNLF ranks has
 resulted in criminal attacks, extortion, and other crimes
 against.some Thai villagers and Khmer and Vietnamese refugees
 in the Thai-Cambodian border areas.
 The other NCR group and the third group in the coalition is
 the National United Front for an Independent, Neutral,
 Peaceful and Cooperative Cambodia (FUNCINPEC), headed by
 Prince Norodom Sihanouk, who ruled as hereditary king and
 later-Head of State until 1970. The appeal of this
 organization centers on the Prince's international stature and
 his popularity within Cambodia. The Sihanoukist National Army
 (ANS) has at least 10,000 armed soldiers.

 During 1987 systematic violations of human rights continued in
 Cambodia, as Vietnam relied on force to maintain its client
 regime in power against the popular will. The Vietnamese
 continued large-scale forced labor work projects in support of
 combat operations in western Cambodia during 1987, in an
 attempt to cut off infiltration by the resistance. According
 to the accounts of workers who fled these projects in 1987,
 exploding mines and diseaso continued to take a heavy toll.
 RESPECT EOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 Reports of political killing in the Vietnamese-controlled areas
 of Cambodia have declined in recent years, but Khmer resistance
 groups continue to report instances of Vietnamese and Heng
 Samrin officials killing suspects during interrogations.
 Death in captivity due to torture or other mistreatment is
 common, according to the testimony of former prasoners. There
 were reports in 1987 of sun--qary executions by units associated
 with the KPNLF, but the circumstances of the alleged killings
 suggest disputes connected with black market activities more
 than political motives.
 Civilians continued to be killed in 1987 during attacks by the
 Khmer Rouge on lines of communication and other economic
 targets. As in previous years, there are many reports to
 indicate that disobedience to the authorities in Khmer Rouge
 encampments often draws severe punishment, sometimes including
 execution. Defectors from the Khmer Rouge report that Khmer
 Rouge prisoners have been killed by mines while performing
 forced labor, such as transporting supplies for guerrilla
 forces in Cambodia. Some former Khmer Rouge believe such
 deaths were not accidental. Attempts to flee Khmer Rouge-
 operated camps for those run by the non-Communist resistance
 groups can also result in death. In several cases during 1987,
 civilians who were successful in escaping Khmer Rouge camps
 did so while under fire from soldiers sent to recapture them.
 b. Disappearance
 There have been reports that Heng Samrin security officials
 have been responsible for the disappearance of persons
 suspected of opposing the regime. Although most who
 disappeared apparently have been imprisoned, some may have
 been killed, but specific evidence is not available.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Physical torture by Vietnamese and Heng Samrin security forces
 has been reported both from rural areas and from Phnom Penh
 prisons. There is a legal prohibition against torture, but
 there are no known cases of anyone being prosecuted under this
 law. According to reports gathered by Amnesty International
 in 1986, people suspected of involvement with the resistance
 run the highest risk of torture, although people alleged to
 have expressed opinions critical of the Heng Samrin regime's
 policies or the role of the Vietnamese in the country are also
 said to risk torture, as are those thought to be trying to
 leave or return from areas under r~sistance control. Torture
 has been reported to take place throughout the country at
 
 
 651
 CAMBODIA
 facilities under the control of both the Ministry of Interior
 (and its subordinate civil police forces) and the armed forces,
 including jails run by the Ministry of Defense in Phnom Penh.
 Vietnamese !expertsr are reported to have participated in or
 have been present'during torture at these centers, especially
 those-at the provincial level and above. Such "experts" are
 also reported to have tortured political suspects in centers
 run exclusively by the Vietnamese military. These include
 jails run by'the propaganda and education brigades in the,
 provinces and by the head offices of their "expert" corps in
 Phnom Penh.       -
 According to Amnesty International, a variety of tortures is
 inflictpd on political suspects detained for interrogation.
 The most commonly cited are lengthy and repeated beatings and
 whippihgs. Detainees are said to have been punched and kicked
 on thebody, headj and extremities; struck with pistol and
 rifle butts' truncheons, wooden staves with sharpened edges,
 and bamboo or iron bars; and whipped with electrical or steel
 cables, chains, rubber hoses, or wet gunny sacks. The victim
 may be tied up during these assaults or blindfolded and hung
 upside down from the ceiling with ropes. There are credible
 reports that many other forms of torture are also used,
 including being buried alive, burning with powdered limestone
 or heated instruments, and the insertion of nails through the
 thigh muscles to the bione.
 Both Amnesty International and the Lawyers Committee note that
 detainees undergoing interrogation in centers higher than the
 district level are generally held incommunicado in small and
 completely dark solitary confinement cells that are poorly
 ventilated and unsanitary. They are immobilized by shackles
 on both legs. Sometimes they also are handcuffed. The
 detainees are allowed no bedding or mosquito netting.
 Detainees whose ill-treatment during interrogation is being
 intehsified are also deprived of food and water progressively
 to undermine their physical strength and .resistance to illness.
 They may not bathe or go outside their cells to relieve
 themselves and are reportedly permitted no medication or
 medical attention.
 The aim of this cruel treatment is apparently to compel
 detainees to confess to crimes and to inform on other suspects
 or persons considered opponents by the authorities. Although
 it is rarely reported that a suspect has been killed during
 the actual interrogation, there are frequent reports of
 detainees dying following interrogation, during the indefinite
 period of detention without charge or trial. Such deaths
 reportedly occur even though the torture is over and conditions
 have improvedg The causes appear to be a combination of
 internal injuries sustained during torture, unattended diseases
 contracted during or after torture, and inadequate diet.
 Suicides also have been reported, as well as cases of detainees
 becoming insane after torture and ill-treatment.
 According to a prisoner who escaped the Battambang provincial
 prison in 1987, new prisoners are immediately sent to the
 interrogation office. Interrogation lasts as long as
 necessary to obtain a confession and, according to this
 source, techniques include kicking and beating the prisoner
 with a stick, suffocating the prisoner by putting a plastic
 bag over his head, and the use of electric shock. He reported
 that prisoners occasionally died as a result of the torture.
 After interrogation, a prisoner is normally transferred to a
 maximum security cell, usually for at least a year until he is
 
 
 652
 CAMBODIA
 considered sufficiently reliable to be transferred to quarters
 with less stringent controls. Under maximum security,
 prisoners are stripped down nightly to their undershorts and
 their hands and legs shackled. Once prisoners are transferred
 to new quarters, they are assigned manual labor tasks either
 within the prison compound or in public areas near the prison.
 A group of Vietnamese captives released by the Khmer Rouge in
 1986 reported being beaten senseless, forced to do hard manual
 labor, and forced to fight each other for the amusement of
 their captors. However, other Vietnamese captives released
 during 1986 reported more acceptable treatment by the Khmer
 Rouge.
 Amnesty International has received reports that some
 undisciplined elements in the NCR had committed extrajudicial
 executions of political and criminal suspects; that they held
 political prisoners without trial and severely mistreated
 them; and that they had raped women prisoners in military
 custody.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, Exile, or Forced Labor
 The Heng Samrin authorities often detain, interrogate, and jail
 resistance sympathizers for extended periods of time without
 formal charges. Amnesty International states that "analysis of
 all the available information indicates that prisons in the PRK
 have held several thousand political prisoners during recent
 years." This estimate does not include so-called "misled
 people restricted by the PRK for reeducation." Of the more
 than 400 political prisoners on which Amnesty International
 had compiled information by early 1987, almost half had been
 confined for at least 7 years.
 Separate sections within the Heng Samrin police are responsible
 for investigation of activities by the non-Communist (KPNLF and
 ANS) and Communist Khmer Rouge resistance groups. The Ministry
 of Interior maintains at least three prisons in Cambodia in
 which suspected supporters of the resistance are held without
 formal charges. Provincial police and joint Vietnamese/Heng
 Samrin military internal security units maintain additional
 detention and interrogation centers. Regulations of the Heng
 Samrin regime call for the arrest and "reeducation" of "any
 person carrying out propaganda campaigns to sabotage internal
 unity and Kampuchea-Laos-Vietnam solidarity." Such
 "reeducation" means indefinite detention to force a change in
 political values.
 Combined with brutal treatment of suspected resistance
 collaborators, the Heng Samrin regime also operates an amnesty
 program for those resistance soldiers who voluntarily surrender
 with their weapons. There are various accounts of the regimen
 awaiting those who return. According to an official of the
 program who defected in.1986, returnees are debriefed and
 returned to their home villages. Informers in the village
 then determine over a period of time whether the person is an
 authentic defector or still works for the resistance, in which
 case he would be rearrested. According to Prime Minister Hun
 Sen, returnees are allowed to return to their home villages
 "after a short period of reeducation." Considerable publicity
 is given to this program by the regime, which claims that large
 numbers of "misled" persons are continuously surrendering to
 authorities, along with their weapons.
 
 
 653
 CAMBODIA
 There is a virtual absence of legal process for those detained
 under theHeng Samrin regime. Detainees are almost never
 informed of the charges against them, nor are they given access
 to a lawyer or informed of any rights or legal protections.
 There is no requirement that officials notify anyone of a
 prisoner's arrest if they deem it is not in the interest of
 the Investigation. According to Amnesty International, the
 same PRK authorities are responsible for. arrests,
 interrogation, decisions on a suspect's guilt or innocence,
 and prison administration.
 Forced labor by the PRK regime and directly by the Vietnamese
 military;is common,. although it is not primarily used as a
 sanctiqn or means of racial, social, or other discrimination.
 The authorities have systematically conscripted Khmer civilians
 from throughout-Cambodia for work on military-related projects
 in or near combat areas along the Thai-Cambodian border. The
 number of:.theseforced laborprs remained in the tens of"
 thousand  during 1987. They were organized into paramilitary
 units in a massiye program to clear brush for fields of fire
 and construct physical obstacles to infiltration. They have
 suffered freguent loss of life from mines, malaria, and other
 diseases-in the remote border areas. Their forced  I
 participationplaces their lives at risk when Vietnamese or
 resistance military actions occur nearby. During 1987 there
 were indications that the number of civilian laborers decreased
 somewJat-frQm the previous year, but this may have been due in
 part to a drought that required farmers in the last half.of the
 year to stay at home awaiting the opportunity to plant crops.
 Several times during 1987 the International Committee of the
 Red Cross tICRC) brought to the attention of PRK officials the
 humanitarian implications of forced civilian labor near the
 border but received no response.
 The Khmer Rouge also require labor from all persons under their
 control, and persons living in camps controlled by the Khmer
 Rouge were prevented from leaving, either to return to areas
 controlled by the Vietnamese or to join other resistance
 groups. Khmer Rouge defectors continued to report in 1987
 that they were forced to carry supplies and ammunition into
 the interipr of Cambodia in support of military operations,
 claiming they were punished if they failed to comply. There
 are credible reports of some forced conscription by the NCR,
 particularly of young males living in NCR-affiliated camps in
 Thailand.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 A 1982 law on court organization provides the right of counsel
 only with prior,pproval of the court. The1981 Constitution
 provides for public trials but allows for closed sessions.
 Political prisoners under the Heng Samrin regime are regularly
 denied fair trials. Estimates of the number of political
 prisoners in Cambodia range from the hundreds to the thousands.
 Reliable figures are not available.
 The Lawyers Committee for Human Rights, as well as Amnesty
 International, also reported the existence of prisons run by
 what it termed the Vietnamese "special branch," such as the
 one designated 7708 in Phnom Penh. This is in fact the
 designation of one of at least 20 propaganda/civic action
 units of the Vietnamese army which work with Heng Samrin
 authorities in each of the four military "fronts" and special
 
 
 654
 CABIODIA
 zones in Cambodia to maintain internal security. The Lawyers
 Committee estimated that political prisoners number in the
 thousands.
 The Heng Samrin regime has reestablished courts and begun to
 develop a legal system, though there have been fewer trials in
 recent years. However, trials are used primarily for purposes
 of propaganda or public intimidation, with the verdict already
 decided. There are few procedural rights for defendants.
 According to a former prisoner who arrived at the Thai border
 in 1986 and had gone through a Heng Samrin trial, defendants
 are required to memorize carefully and rehearse in advance all
 the questions and answers to be presented in court. Several
 police officials who had left the country and were interviewed
 by Amnesty International said that as of 1984 most cases were
 decided by the interrogators without reference to any tribunal.
 According to one, important cases might be referred to the
 tribunal, but "the tribunal does not have the right to reject
 the judgment of the interrogators. It only pronounces the
 sentence." A former inmate of the Battambang prison reported
 that in April 1987, very few of the approximately 900 prisoners
 in the facility, most of whom were arrested by PRK authorities
 for alleged cooperation with the resistance, were incarcerated
 as a result of judicial proceedings, but rather because they
 eventually confessed to their crimes under interrogation.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Heng Samrin authorities search whenever and wherever they
 wish. Networks of informers report to the secret police, and
 Vietnamese personnel are assigned to monitor all levels of the
 Heng Samrin internal security apparatus. Refugees arriving at
 the border in 1986 reported the development of tightly
 controlled fortified villages in areas of resistance activity.
 Access to these villages is controlled by Heng Samrin or
 Vietnamese troops, and people are forcibly relocated into them
 to prevent contact with resistance forces. According to
 arrivals at the border in 1987, and to one Western journalist
 who accompanied guerilla forces into Cambodia, almost all
 villages close to the Thai-Cambodian border in the northwest
 provinces have been relocated to the other side of a border
 security strip, especially those near known infiltration
 points. As part of the Vietnamese program to stop
 infiltration, this strip was cleared of all trees and brush,
 providing a clear field of fire to defending forces and clean
 dirt to reveal tracks of anyone crossing in the night. Heng
 Samrin authorities also began in 1986 to require that families
 in contested areas account for missing family members.
 Failure to explain adequately their absence automatically
 implies that they are with the resistance, and the family is
 then relocated to a fortified village. There are also numerous
 reports, confirmed by former PRK district officials, that the
 regime confiscates the majority of rice and other foodstuffs
 from villagers in an effort to prevent cooperation with the
 resistance.
 The Khmer Rouge strictly limits the social activity of those
 under their control. For instance, they punish people
 marrying without permission, having contacts with foreigners
 and listening to unauthorized radio broadcasts.
 
 
 CAMBODIA
 g. Violations of Humanitarian Law in Armed Conflicts
 Since 1981 the ICRC has sought permission from the Phnom Penh
 authorities without success to visit prisoners captured in
 combat. It has also been unsuccessful in persuading the
 resistance factions to allow them access to prisoners held at
 their military camps. The ICRC has also had no success in
 persuading Thai authorities to allow it access to Vietnamese
 prisoners helq in Thai prisons, nor in persuading the PRK
 authorities to allow it access to a small number of Thai
 prisoners reportedly held in Cambodian prisons. Nevertheless,
 the ICRQ has pursued a program to disseminate information
 about tife'proper treatment of prisoners of war and the role
 the ICRC traditionally plays during conflicts'.
 Attacks resulting in civilian casualties are frequently
 mounted by the Khmer Rouge, particularly on trains and
 highways. Khmer Rouge radio also frequently claims credit for
 rocket attacks on urban areas and attacks by agents who lob
 grenades at the "enemy" in movie theaters and other gatherings.
 To the degree that any of these claims are true, it is unlikely
 that the victims are solely military. It appears that an
 important aspect of Khmer Rouge strategy is to destroy through
 terror tactics any faith the people may have in'the ability of
 the regime to protect them. Non-Communist resistance
 operations have not to date involved targets likely to cause
 ,extensive civilian'casualties, and they claim that avoidance
 of civilian casualties is a high priority in their planning.
 There is no credible evidepce that chemical or biological
 agents have been used in the conflict, despite vociferous
 accusations from both sides. Although the PRK regime has
 attempted to confiscate all excess food from areas of
 resistance activity, in an attempt to deny food to guerrillas,
 none of the parties to the conflict has yet targeted or
 attempted to blockade civilian food supplies or other
 necessities.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 In Heng Samrin areas, the press ahd radio are wholly
 controlled by the regime. Criticism of the regime is not
 tolerated, nor are foreign books and periodicals permitted,
 except those officially distributed. There have been reports
 of arrests for listening to foreign radio broadcasts. A
 similar situation exists in Khmer Rouge camps. The
 non-Communist groups do not have similar restrictions.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The only associations permitted by the Heng Samrin regime are
 those created to support the regime, such as those for farmers,
 women, and youth. Organized labor is totally under the
 regime's control, and industries have organized branches of
 the official "Trade Union for National Salvation." Collective
 bargaining is unheard of.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 The Heng Samrin regime has permitted the return of religious
 practices, but has not reinstated Buddhism as a state religion,
 nor actively encouraged it. The number of Buddhist temples
 (wats) is far smaller today than before 1970, and there are
 
 
 656
 CAMBODIA
 generally only two to four monks per wat, far fewer than
 before the war. It is forbidden for men under 50 years of age
 to be ordained. Religious affairs are overseen by the National
 United Front for Construction and Defense, the same government
 agency that seeks to organize women, youth, workers, and
 religious groups to support the State. Communities that wish
 to construct a wat must apply to the local front committee for
 permission. At the second Buddhist monks' conference in Phnom
 Penh in 1984, a resolution was passed forcing Buddhism into
 the "two strategic tasks of the party--namely, to defend the
 fatherland and to build it through the period of transition
 step-by-step toward socialism." At the fifth conference of
 Buddhist monks in October 1986, PRK politburo member Chea Sim
 praised the contributions of the Buddhist monks and laymen in
 Phnom Penh for their implementation of the party's and state's
 political line toward Buddhism. In general, the Heng Samrin
 authorities attempt to use Buddhism as one of a number of
 organizations for "mass mobilization" to implement party
 policies.
 Christian groups are harassed by the Heng Samrin regime. The
 Protestant and Roman Catholic communities in Phnom Penh
 reportedly are not authorized to meet. Muslims, most of whom
 are ethnic Chams rather than Khmer, have been encouraged by
 the Heng Samrin regime to renew their religious community, and
 Muslims have spoken out in public in support of the Heng Samrin
 regime and against the excesses of the former Khmer Rouge
 regime.
 When in power in Phnom Penh, the Khmer Rouge disestablished
 Buddhism as the state religion. Since their expulsion from
 power, the Khmer Rouge have tried to give the impression of
 reform. However, defectors from the Khmer Rouge zone in 1985
 report that Buddhism is still discouraged by Khmer Rouge
 authorities. Christianity and Islam were even more ruthlessly
 suppressed by the Khmer Rouge when they controlled the country
 and are not known to have been revived in Khmer Rouge-
 controlled areas.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 The Heng Samrin regime tries to control tightly all travel
 within areas under its control. A system of neighborhood
 surveillance, modeled after the Vietnamese system, was
 introduced in 1981. A system requiring family registration
 and identification books was begun in 1980, and in 1983 the
 registration effort was placed under the police in each local
 administrative unit. Complex regulations govern movement of
 families and individuals within Cambodia. Passes are required
 for internal movement between villages. Checkpoints are
 ubiquitous, and bribes as well as written authority are
 required to pass them, although checkpoints often can be
 dodged by avoiding roads. Only a few top Heng Samrin regime
 officials travel abroad. Other Khmer seeking to leave the
 country flee to the Thai border to escape the conflict or in
 the hope that they can enter U.N.-supported refugee camps in
 Thailand. Except for those who bribe their way out, the Heng
 Samrin regime routinely imprisons those caught attempting to
 flee, as well as those believed to be returning from border
 encampments affiliated with the CGDK. The Heng Samrin regime
 has agreed in principle to accept returning displaced persons
 from camps in Thailand, but has taken only one elderly woman
 so far because it has not reached an agreement with the United
 Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) on the mechanics
 
 
 657*
 CAMBODIA
 of repatxiation. Most of the Khmer allowed refugee status in
 Thailand-have been approved for resettlement and departed for
 Western-countries. Over 20,000 Khmer refugees remain at the
 Khao-I-Dang holding center in Thailand. Another 269,000 Khmer
 who have not been accorded refugee status in 'Thailand remain
 as displaced persons in camps on Thai territory near the
 border.
 The Khmer Rouge also tightly control movement within their zone
 and determine whether non-Communist forces will be permitted to
 operate in or cross what they consider their "liberated areas"
 in Cambodia. The Khmer Rouge generally refuse access by
 international voluntary agency personnel to monitor conditions
 in their affiliated camps in Thailand. Some limited monitoring
 occurred in -late 1987 after U.N. organizations threatened to
 curtail assistance, and negotiations continue Tor mdre
 extensive monitoring. Several small groups of Khmer Rouge
 escaped to the non-Communists in 1986 and 1987. Freedom of
 movement is less restricted in the non-Communist camps,
 although still-difficult. -Those residents wishing to move to
 a camp-controlled by a different faction must obtain the  -
 permission of the camp leadership or attempt to move on their
 own. Military force is. not deployed to stop them, although
 bandits and other hazards make such efforts dangerous.
 International voluntary agencies have good access to
 NCR-associated camps in Thailand.
 Section 3 Respect for Political'Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government-
 The Khmer people do not enjoy the fundamental right of
 self-determination. -The KPRP, a party which acknowledges a
 serious shortage of members, dominates political life in areas
 controlled by the Heng Samrin regime. Major policies are
 approved by Vietnam, and mahy day-to-day administrative
 decisions, especially ip internal security matters, are made
 unilaterally by Vietnamese officials.
 Political aspirants in Heng Samrin-controlled areas must study
 the current political dogma, which centers on acceptance of
 the Vietnamese explanation for Hanoi's dominant position in
 Cambodia. Middle- and high-level Heng Samrin officials must
 attend political schools in Phnom Penh and in Vietnam.
 Relatively few Heng Samrin officials are considered reliable
 by the Vietnamese. The highest positions of trust are given
 to Khmer loyal to Hanoi prior to 1975, followed by pre-1978
 defectors from the Khmer Rouge, other former Khmer Rouge cadre,
 nonpolitical "intellectuals" (including many pre-1975 school
 teachers) and low-ranking officials of pre-1975 governments, in
 that order. While'attempting to build an indigenous Communist
 party and government structure in Cambodia, Vietnam itself
 maintains complete control. Elections in Heng Samrin areas do
 not allow genuine political participation, but rather are
 staged by the regime to attempt to demonstrate legitimacy and
 to underscore the relative status of leaders by varying
 reported percentages of the "vote." Reports suggest that in
 the 1981 national elections, percentages were manipulated, and
 some victors were named regardless of the number of votes they
 received. Vietnamese district-level advisors were reliably
 reported to have picked candidates for lower-level elections.
 Although National Assembly members are supposed to serve terms
 of 4 years (the second round of elections should have been
 held in 1986), no elections were held. Instead, the existing
 National Assembly was extended for another 4-year term.
 
 
 658
 CA4BODIA
 The Khmer Rouge Communist Party of Kampuchea was ostensibly
 dissolved in December 1981, but it continues to exist in areas
 controlled by the Khmer Rouge. In fact, the party, in which
 power is concentrated in the hands of fewer than 10 people,
 controls all political, economic, and military life in those
 areas. No opposition is possible. Although Pol Pot
 purportedly "retired" in 1985 and assumed an advisory position
 on national security, defectors from the Khmer Rouge report
 that power continues to be held by the pre-1979 leadership,
 and Pol Pot himself is reported to be the most powerful
 military commander of the Khmer Rouge and the de facto
 commander-in-chief.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Human rights violations in Cambodia have been the subject of
 intense international attention since 1978, when the United
 Nations Human Rights Commission and its subcommission on the
 Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities
 began investigating the problem. In February 1987, the
 Commission adopted the latest in a series of resolutions on
 Cambodia, reiterating its condemnation of persistent
 violations of human rights in Cambodia and reaffirming that
 the continuing occupation of Cambodia by foreign forces
 deprives the people of Cambodia of their right to
 self-determination. Authorities in the areas controlled by
 the Heng Samrin regime and Khmer Rouge have not permitted
 investigation of charges of human rights violations.
 In late 1984, the Heng Samrin regime declined to permit the
 Lawyers Committee for Human Rights to visit areas it
 controlled. A delegation from the Lawyers Committee visited
 Khmer camps located in Thailand on the Cambodian border in
 January 1987 and published in February a report on the human
 rights situation there. The report was critical of human
 rights abuses committed by the Khmer Rouge, bandits who had
 deserted from the KPNLF, and some active duty KPNLF troops
 against Cambodian refugees in Thailand. The report notes,
 though, that the KPNLF has begun to address the problem by
 investigating alleged abuses, setting up a military court, and
 transferring military personnel from the area. In addition,
 international organizations moved some civilians out of the
 KPNLF-controlled camps where abuses were most often reported.
 The Heng Samrin regime and the Khmer Rouge areas have Red
 Cross organizations, but neither they nor any other groups in
 those areas have a role in the protection of human rights.
 Persistent attempts throughout 1986 and 1987 by Amnesty
 International to obtain permission to visit Cambodia have
 elicited no response from Phnom Penh authorities. The
 non-Communist camps along the Thai-Cambodian border have a
 substantial daytime presence of voluntary agency and
 international organization staff who have intervened to secure
 better treatment of minorities, such as Vietnamese refugees
 among the Khmer.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
