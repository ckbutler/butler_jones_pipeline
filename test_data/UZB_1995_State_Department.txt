 UZBEKISTAN
 Four years after declaring independence, Uzbekistan has made some progress in
 the transition from its authoritarian legacy towards democracy. President Islam
 Karimov and the centralized executive branch which serves him remain the domi-
 nant forces in political life. Parliamentary elections in December 1994 and January
 1995 represented a step forward in technical implementation of the democratic proc-
 ess at the ballot box but were flawed due to the lack of free speech and press during
 the campaign. While the elections were technically multiparty, opposition parties
 were not allowed to participate. The Government continues to repress severely inde-
 pendent opposition parties and movements. It justifies its repressive policy by invok-
 ing the specter of Islamic fundamentalism, the civil strife that has plagued neigh-
 boring Tajikistan and Afghanistan, and possible opposition preparations for armed
 struggle. The Constitution provides for an independent judicial authority. However,
 in political cases, government direction influences the judiciary.
 On March 26, a referendum was held extending the president's term for an addi-
 tional 3 years to 2000. The professed reason for this extension was to synchronize
 the President's and Parliament's 5-year terms. The referendum passed by an almost
 unanimous margin in a process that was characterized by a lack of public debate
 and the almost universal practice of one person casting votes for an entire extended
 family. Even allowing for "family voting, the official participation results could not
 have been valid. The President said that he would count the extension as a second
 term, the constitutional limit on presidential terms. However, on August 30, Par-
 liament passed a resolution opposing the President's decision and has decided that
 the referendum is an extension of his first term.
 The National Security Service (NSS-formerly the Committee for State Security,
 or KGB) deals with a broad range of national security questions-including corrup-
 tion, organized crime, and narcotics control. The NSS is the lead agency when oppo-
 sition figures are arrested for crimes in these areas. The Ministry of Internal Affairs
 
 
 1111
 (MVD) prosecutes domestic crimes and often plays the lead role in investigating
 cases against political opposition figures. Members of the security forces continued
 to be responsible for serious human rights abuses.
 Uzbekistan has taken si gficant steps toward market reform. The economy is
 based primarily on agriculture and agricultural processing, Uzbekistan is the
 world's fourth largest producer of cotton and has large deposits of gold, strategic
 minerals, gas, and oil. The Government has proclaimed its commitment to a gradual
 transition to a free market economy. It accelerated macroeconomic reforms sharply
 in the second half of 1994 and continued those reforms throughout 1995. Its reform
 programs cut inflation, subsidies, and the budget deficit, increased interest rates,
 and produced a more realistic exchange rate. However, progress on privatization of
 the large state-owned enterprises that account for the bulk of gross domestic prod-
 uct remained slow and a host of formal and info-mal barriers continued to constrain
 the nascent private sector.
 The Government's respect for citizens' human rights did not significantly improve,
 although in April President Karimov and other senior officials began to acknowledge
 that Uzbekistan has not made enough progress on human rights and needs to accel-
 erate democratic reform. Citizens cannot exercise fully their right peacefully to
 change their government. To control the political arena, the Government continues
 to deny registration to independent political parties and some other social groups.
 It continues to suppress unregistered opposition parties and movements and se-
 verely limits distribution of opposition literature. It continues to ban unsanctioned
 public meetings and demonstrations. Security forces detained or arrested opposition
 activists on false charges in a few cases. Police often beat criminal suspects and de-
 tention can be prolonged. Although the Constitution expressly prohibits it press
 censorship continues, and freedom of expression is constrained by an atmosphere of
 repression which makes it difficult to criticize the Government publicly. To counter
 what it perceives as extremist Islamic views, the Government places some limita-
 tions on freedom of religion in certain areas. Despite a constitutional prohibition,
 there continues to be significant traditional societal discrimination and domestic vio-
 lence against women.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Extrajudicial Killing.-Evidence strongly suggests that local busi-
 nessman Bakhtiar Yakubov died as a result of beatings he sustained while in cus-
 tody at the Ministry of Internal Affairs, reportedly in connection with a criminal
 case against opposition leader Ibragim Buiev. The Government is conducting an in-
 ternal investigation.
 b. Disappearance.-According to Islamic activists, the imam of an Andijon mosque
 was detained at the Tashkent airport by NSS officers on August 30 while enroute
 to a conference in Moscow. There is no official admission that he has been arrested
 or detained, and no further information on his whereabouts.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Although the law prohibits such practices, police beat and otherwise treated detain-
 ees abusively to obtain confesions. Police allegedly beat Dimitri Fattakhov, Aleksei
 Smirnov, and Oleg Gusev in order to obtain their confessions of complicity in a mur-
 der. There allegations appear credible.
 On April 18, opposition leader and former Vice President Shukhrullah Mirsaidov
 and his son were abducted and beaten by unidentified persons. The elder Miraidov
 was drugged in what appeared to be a blackmail attempt. Ministry of Internal Af-
 fairs officers were believed responsible. The Government is conducting an investiga-
 tion.
 Two women, one employed by an environmental nongovernment organization
 (NGO), and the other a relative of a prominent opponent of the Government, were
 arrested on smuggling charges in mid-July. They were taken into custody by the
 NSS, although the alleged violations would normally have resulted oniy in a fine;
 government security authorities claimed they were arrested because of indications
 the women's activities were connected to organized crime. The reported cir-
 cumstances of their detentions were harsh and suggest an effort to extract confes-
 sions by coercive means: the women were kept, separately, in isolation, and their
 fan'ilies were prevented from seeing them; food packages brought to supplement the
 basic prison diet were not passed on by athorities. One of the women signed a con-
 fession but later repudiated it. Bath women were pregant when they were arrested
 but underwent aberions shortly after being detained. There are allegations, based
 on conversations with the women and their relatives, that the abortions were part
 of the pattern of coercion. However, following their release on bail several months
 
 
 1112
 later, the two women also stated that they had consented to the abortions after
 medical examinations and sonograms indicating one of the fetuses was malformed
 and the other dead.
 Prison conditions are inadequate and worse for male than for female prisoners.
 Due to limited resources, prison overcrowding is a problem. Political prisoners are
 often not allowed visitors or any other direct form of contact with family and
 friends.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Uzbekistan continues to use the Soviet
 legal system and laws on detention have not changed since independence. According
 to the law, police may hold a person suspected of committing a crime for up to 3
 days. At the end of this period, the suspect must be either officially charged or re-
 leased. A procurator's order is required for arrests hut not for detentions. A court
 case mustbe scheduled within 15 days of the arrest, and the defendant may be de-
 tained during this priod. A defendant may not have access to counsel while in de-
 tention but only ar formal arrest. Delays between detention and trials can be
 lengthy-one Islamic cleric detained in September 1994 did not go on trial until
 May 1995.
 In some cases, opposition figures were charged with offenses unrelated to their
 criticism of government policy, such as drug possession, weapons possession, or dis-
 orderliness. Opposition activist Ibragim Buriev was arrested on March 30 for posses-
 sion of weapons and narcotics. The cha    against him were based on planted evi-
 dnce. He was released a month later see      tion 3). Religious leaders from the
 Kokand area were charged with drug and weapons possession.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-In political, cases, government direction influences
 the *diciary.
 There is a three-tier court system: the people's court on the district level, the re-
 gional courts, and the Supreme Court. District court decisions may be appealed to
 the next higher level within 10 days of the ruling. The new Criminal Code reduces
 the list of crimes punishable by death to murder, espionage, and treason, eliminat-"
 ing the economic crimes punishable by death in the former Soviet code. Officially
 and in recent practice, most court cases are open to the public but may be closed
 in exceptional cases, such as those involving state secrets, rape, or young defend-
 ants.
 Under the Constitution, the President appoints all judges for 10-year terms. They
 may be removed for crimes or failure to fulfill their obligations. Power to remove
 judges for failure to fulfill their obligations rests with the President, except for Su-
 preme Court judges, whose removal must also be confirmed by Parliament.
 Uzbekistan still uses the Soviet judiciary system which features trial by a panel
 of three judges: 1 professional judge and 2 "people's assessors" who are chosen by
 the workers collectives for a period of 2  years. The professional judge presides
 and directs the proceedings.
 Defendants have the right to attend the proceedings, confront witnesses, and
 present evidence. The State will provide a lawyer without charge, but by law the
 accused has the right to hire an attorney. In some political cases, the defendants
 have not had access to lawyers. For example, Tbragim Buriev (see Section 1.d.) was
 unable to meet the lawyer his family had hired.
 Detainees deemed not to be violent may be released on their own recognizance
 pending trial. No money need be posted as bond, but in such cases the accused must
 usually sign a pledge not to leave the city.
 The Government denies that there are any political prisoners in Uzbekistan. How-
 ever, by all evidence, the Government does hold political prisoners. Several opposi-
 tion members are being held for "antigovernment activities" (distributing news-
 papers of the opposition Erk party). Estimates by independent opposition and
 human rights groups in Uzbekistan on the number of political prisoners range from
 15 to 40. There is not enough information available to determine whether other pris-
 oners are jailed for political offenses.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-By law,
 search warrants issued by a procurator are required. There is no provision for a ju-
 dicial review of warrants. There does not appear to be a legal mechanism for author-
 izing telephone wiretapping or monitoring. Security agencies nonetheless monitor
 telephone calls, and there is evidence that they employ surveillance and wiretap
 telephones in the cases of persons involved in opposition political activities. Certain
 high-profile opposition activists were the subject of very visible surveillance, includ-
 ing round-the-clock police monitoring of all movements.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-Although the Constitution provides for "freedom
 of thought, speech, and convictions," freedom of public speech remained severely
 
 
 1113
 limited. The fear of expressing views critical of the President and Government per-
 sisted as the Government continued its general crackdown on all forms of opposi-
 tion. A February 15, 1991, law against "offending the honor and dignity of the Presi-
 dent" limits the ability to criticize the President.
 Although the Constitution prohibits censorship, it is widely practiced and the Gov-
 ernment tolerates little, if any, criticism of its actions. Newspapers may not be
 printed without the censor's approval. Journalists and writers who want to ensure
 that their work is published report that they practice self-censorship.
 The Uzbekistan Information    ncy cooperates closely with the presidential staff
 to prepare and distribute all officially sanctioned news and information. Press re-
 ports from Moscow and Uzbekistan media sources allege that the presidential
 apparat has advised newspaper editors-in-chief to limit strictly their contact with
 American and some European diplomats. Nearly all newspayers are government-
 owned and controlled; the key papers are organs of government ministries. State en-
 trprises control the printing presses..
 elast opposition newspaper to be published was that of the Erk party. In Janu-
 ary 1993, the newspaper was banned and has not been published since then.
 The Government also forbids the distribution of foreign newspapers critical of
 Uzbekistan. The publication of the local editions of Izvestia and Pravda and the sale
 of the Moscow edtion remained suspended throughout 1995. All newspapers, maa-
 zines, and weeklies have to be registered, a procedure which includes providing r-
 formation about the sources of funding, means of distribution, founders, and spon-
 sors. A resolution by the Cabinet of Ministers bans private persons and journalist
 collectives from founding newspapers or magazines. Foreign" corespondents based
 in Tashkent reportothat the security services have harassed and threatened their
 translators and other local employees.
 Television broadcasting is state controlled. Although there are local stations in
 various regions, nationwde programming is on two state-run channels that fully
 support the Government and its police. T[he Ostankino channel from Russia has
 evening broadcasts. Its news broadcasts are blacked out when they are critical of
 the Government. A cable television joint venture between the state broadcasting
 company and an Ameica      n conpany broadcasts the Hong Kong-based "Star TV"
 channes, including British Boadcasting Corporation (BBC) World News to
 Tashkent and a few other locations. Radio Liberty, the Voice of America and the
 BBC are            few sources of uncontrolled news, although the Government oc-
 casionally interfered with Radio Liberty broadcasts.
 In addition to state-controlled television there is at least one major station in
 Samarkand that considers itself independent. It claims not to receive any govern-
 ment subsidy and to exist wholly on income derived from advertisers. It currently
 has two channes and plans a third, devoted to business news. The station broad-
 casts national programs and the Ostankino channel. It plans its own programming
 to compete with these offerings. It is clearly sensitive to political concerns from the
 center but claims not to be formally censored.
 There are no private publishing houses, and government approval is required for
 all publications.
 Virtually all academic institutions and academies are experiencing increased au-
 tnomy, although freedom of expression is still limited. Most institutions are in the
 proess of revising curriculum, and western tetbooks are in  at demand.
 b. Freedom to Peaceful Assembly and Association.The Constitution states that
 the authorities have the right to suspend or ban rallies, meetings, and demnstra-
 tions on security grounds. The Government must sanction demonstrations and does
 not routinely grant this permission. After cordons of militia prevented attempts to
 hold unsanctioned demonstratioas in 1992, the opposition has made no attempts to
 hold ublic meetings since then.
 The Government also limits the exercise of freedom of as-ociation by refusing to
 register opposition political parties and movements. The Constitution provides no
 general guarantees of freedom of association; it places broad limitations on the types
 of gronps that may form and reqires that all organizations be formalld registered
 with the Governmewt. The Goveranmet frequently and seemingly without legal
 basis deaies such regis tration to groups in any way opposed to the established
 order. To be considered a public association oraizats must be registered in ac-
 cordance with the procedure prescribed by law.
 To register a party must submit a list of at least 3,000 members and meet other
 requirements, such as providing an official address. Government control over build-
 ings and office space limits the ability of unofficial groups to obtain an official ad-
 dress. The Government has repeatedly denied the Birlik movement permission to
 register as a party, fist claiming irregularities in its membership list, then com-
 plaining about the group's name, and finally noting its lack of an official address.
 
 
 1114
 
 The Constitution and a December 1991 amendment to the law on political parties
 bans those of a religious nature. This principle is cited for denying registration to
 religious parties, including the Islamic Renaissance Party (IRP).
 Nonpolitical associations and social organizations usually do not encounter corn-
 parable difficulties in registering, and the number of such groups expanded in 1995.
 However, some evangelical churches and some foreign humanitarian assistance
 groups found it difficult to obtain registration or reregistration.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of religion and for
 the principle of separation of religion and state. Although the Government generally
 respects this right, it places some limitations on freedom of religion in certain areas.
 After the enforced atheism of the Soviet period, religious communities are experienc-
 ing a significant revival. Religious education is becoming more widespread, although
 it is not included in state schools.
 While Islam is the religion of the majority, ethnic minorities may also practice
 their religion in relative freedom. Synagogues for the Jewish community are openly
 functioning; Hebrew education (long lanned under the Soviets) Jewish cultural
 events, and the publication of a community newspaper take place undisturbed.
 Churches have been returned to their ethnic communities and openly function with-
 in them.
 However, tensions arise when churches attempt to convert across ethnic lines, es-
 pecially when they attempt to convert members of generally Muslim ethnic groups
 to Christianity. Although distribution of religious literature is legal in Uzbekistan,
 missionary activity and proselytizing is not.
 Fearing the destabilizing influence of extremist Islamic forces, the Government
 has tried to temper the extent of this spiritual renaissance by controlling the Is-
 lamic hierarchy, the content of imams' sermons, and the extent and substance of
 Islamic materials published in Uzbekistan. The Government has detained a number
 of Fergana Valley islamic clerics on arious charges (see Sections 1.b. and 1.d.), and
 closed some mosques. Bureaucratic restrictions have inhibited the free operation of
 numerous medreses (religious schools).
 d. Freedom of Mooement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Constitution provides for free movement within the country and
 across its borders. In January the Government began to issue new passports to ev-
 eryone over age 16. These replace the old system of separate internal and external
 passports. In addition, Uzb  tan has greatly simplified the process of obtaining
 exit visas, which are valid for a period of 2 years and no longer require invitations.
 Most barriers to emigration were lifted before the Soviet breakup. Although in
 some instances emigrants are delayed by long waits for passports and exit visas, po-
 tential emigrants who can find a host country willing to accept them are able to
 leave the country. Since independence, a significant number of non-Uzbeks, includ-
 ing Russians, Jews Ukrainians, and others have emigrated, although no exact fig-
 ures are available. khese people have left due to fear of limited future economic and
 social prospects for non-Uzbeks. The travel of local citizens within Uzbekistan is not
 controlled, unlike travel by foreigners, including journalists. Due to treaties between
 their countries and Uzbekistan, citizens of the United States, France, Germany the
 United Kingdom, and the Republic of Korea receive visas valid for travel throughout
 Uzbekistan. Other foreign visitors must have each city they wish to visit noted on
 their visas. Tourists seeking to check into hotels without the appropriate internal
 visa often find themselves having to pay fines or bribes to the visa police. In mid-
 1995, a presidential edict decreed that the ancient cities of Tashkent, Samarkand,
 Bukhara, and Khiva would henceforth be 'open cities," for which a separate visa
 notation is not required for nationals of any country. However, it is not clear wheth-
 er implementing regulations are yet in place.
 The law on citizenship stipulates that citizens do not lose their citizenship if they
 reside overseas. However, since Uzbekistan does not provide for dual citizenship,
 those acquiring the citizenship of other countries will lose their Uzbekistani citizen-
 ship. If they return to Uzbekistan as foreign citizens, they are subject to foreign visa
 regulations. There is no evidence that anyone was denied permission to return.
 There is no law concerning the rights of refugees and asylum seekers. The Gov-
 ernment considers asylum seekers from Tajikistan and Afghanistan to be economic
 migrants, and such individuals are subject to deportation if their residency docu-
 ments are not in order.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 While the Constitution provides for this right in reality citizens cannot exercise
 their right to change their government through peaceful and democratic means.
 Government measures severely repress opposition groups and individuals and apply
 
 
 1115
 harsh limits on freedom of expression. The Government professes the desire to cre-
 ate a multiparty democracy but controls the creation of new parties. Due to the
 deregistration of the one opposition party and the one opposition movement in 1993,
 there are no true independent opposition parties legally active.
 An across-the-board crackdown on actual and potential opposition groups and in-
 dividuals continued so that by the end of the year few people were willing to chal-
 lenge the Government's grip on power or even risk criticizing it publicly. In Feb-
 ruary the Government ordered the closure of a bank owned by political dissident
 Rustam Usmanov. In March judges convicted all seven defendants connected to the
 Erk party on charges of attempting to overthrow constitutional order and organizing
 antistate agitation. Birlik leader Ibragim Buriev was arrested on March 30 on false
 charges of weapons and narcotics possession within days of his return to Uzbekistan
 from an extended stay abroad (see Section 1.d.). He was released on April 29 follow-
 ing international protests. On April 18, leading oppsition figure Shukrulla
 Mirsaidov was abducted, severely beaten, and left naked on a rural road side. The
 incident occurred shortly after Mirsaidov's criticism of the Government appeared in
 a New York Times article. Subsequent threats against Mirsaidov caused him to de-
 cline to meet with a visiting foreign government human rights official.
 Uzbekistan is ruled by a highly centralized presidency, comprising the President
 and a small inner circle of advisers and senior government officials. President
 Karimov, formerly the first secretary of the Communist Party in Uzbekistan under
 Soviet rule, was elected in a limited multicandidate election in 1991. A Soviet-style
 referendum on March 26 extended Karimov's term in office until 2000.
 The President is the Chairman of the People's Democratic Party of Uzbekistan
 (PDP), the country's largest party. Most government officials are also members of
 the PDP, although it does not play the leading role in governance or cadre selection
 that was playedby the Communist Party during the Soviet period. The other legally
 registered parties include: the Homeland Progress Party, the Social-Democratic
 Party of Uzbekistan (Adolat), the National Rebirth Democratic Party, and the Na-
 tional Unity Social Movement. Other political groups such as Birlik, the People's
 Movement of Turkestan, and the Islamic Renaissance Party have been denied per-
 mission to register as parties. The Erk party lost its registration in 1993 when the
 Government required all parties to reregister.
 The Homeland Progress Party was created as a loyal "constructive opposition"
 party in June 1992, and its existence provided the appearance of a multiparty sys-
 tem during the December 1994/January 1995 parliamentary elections. Since the
 elections, two additional parties (the Adolat Social Democratic Party and the Na-
 tional Revival Party) and one movement (Unity) have registered and gained seats
 in Parliament through switched membership of already-elected members or unop-
 posed by elections to open seats. None of the parties in Parliament considers itself
 an "opposition" party: all proclaim their support for the President's policies.
 Traditionally, women participate much less than men in government and politics.
 Only 13 of the 250 deputies in Parliament are female. The female chairperson of
 the governmental National Women's Committee was named by the President as a
 deputy Prime Minister on March 2. Her duties specifically include monitoring the
 rights and welfare of women.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The Government disapproves of local nongovernmental human rights organiza-
 tions and has restricted their operations. It continues to deny the Human Rights
 Society of Uzbekistan, a local group organized in 1992, permission to register. In
 February the President appointed a Humans Rights Commissioner and in May a
 Parliamentary Commission on Human Rights was established.
 Mikhail Ardzinov, deputy chairman of the Human Rights Society of Uzbekistan,
 was temporarily detained in March to prevent him from protesting the referendum
 to extend the President's term.
 The Government routinely criticizes international human rights groups and West-
 ern and Russian reporters for what it considers biased reporting on human rights
 in Uzbekistan. In the past the Government denied access to such groups. However,
 in 1995 the Government did permit Human Rights Watch/Helsinki to visit
 Uzbekistan twice and meet with both governmental and nongovernmental figures.
 Human Rights Watch was given permission to open an office in Tashkent in Novem-
 ber. In addition, the Organization on Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE)
 opened a regional office in Tashkent, which has been welcomed by government offi-
 cials.
 
 
 1116
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 Both the Constitution and the 1992 law on citizenship prohibit discrimination on
 the basis of sex, religion, language, or social status, and officially sanctioned dis-
 crimination does not occur. The Government is proud of its diverse ethnic mix and
 senior officials often comment on the contributions the 115 different ethnic minori-
 ties have made to society.
 Women.-Spousal abuse is common in Uzbekistan, but local activists have no sta-
 tistics. Wife beating is considered a personal family affair rather than a criminal
 act, and'thus such cases rarely come to court. A female journalist, who studied wom-
 en's problems in Uzbekistan in the early 1990's, estimated that approximately 50
 percent of the self-immolation suicides throughout Central Asia are related to
 women seeking an escape from chronic beatings. There is no current statistical data
 available on self-immolation or suicide rates among women.
 Although discrimination against women is prohibited by law, traditional cultural
 and religious practices severely limit their role in everyday society. For these rea-
 sons, women are severely underrepresented in high-level positions. On March 2,
 President Karimov issued an edict on measures to increase the role of women in
 society, particularly extending their participation in state and social administration
 and coordinating the activities of ministries and social organizations as they relate
 to women's issues. In this connection a new pest, deputy Prime Minister, was estab-
 lished with responsibilities for the management of matters connected with further-
 ing the role of women in society. The edict also created heads of women's affairs
 in the autonomous republic of Karakalpakstan, regions, cities, and districts. The
 Ministry of Finance was ordered to allocate the necessary funds to finance these
 new positions and working bodies.
 Due to traditional roles, women usually marry young, bear many children, and
 confine their activities within the family. In rural areas, women often find them-
 selves limited to arduous labor in the cotton fields. However, women are not for-
 mally impeded from seeking a role in the work place: the barriers to equality for
 women are cultural, not legal, and women who open businesses or seek careers are
 not legally hindered.
 Children.-The Constitution provides for children's rights, stating that parents
 are obliged to support and care for their children until they are of age. The State
 grants monetary allowances to families based on their number of children. There is
 no pattern of societal abuse of children, Uzbekistan has one of the highest birthrates
 in the former Soviet Union. Over half the Republic's population is under the age
 of 15.
 People With Disabilities.-One of Uzbekistan's first laws, adopted only 2 months
 after independence in November 1991, guaranteed support for the disabled. This
 law was aimed at ensuring the disabled the same rights as other people. However,
 little effort is made to bring the disabled into the mainstream. The State cares for
 the mentally disabled in special homes. The Government has not mandated access
 for the disabled.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-The population of approximately 23 million
 is about 71 percent Uzbeks, 8 percent Russians, 5 percent Tajiks, 4 percent Tatars
 and 3 percent Kazaks, and many other ethnic groups represented. The Government
 likes to boast that more than 115 nationalities live together peacefully in
 Uzbekistan.
 The citizenship law, passed in 1992, does not impose language requirements for
 citizenship. Nonetheless, the language issue remains very sensitive. Uzbek has been
 declared the state language, and the Constitution requires that the President must
 speak Uzbek. However, the language law provides for Russian as the "language of
 interethnic communication." Russian is widely spoken in the main cities, and Tajik
 is widely spoken in Samarkand and Bukhara Oblasts. The Government hopes to
 switch to the Latin alphabet by 2000 but has been hampered by the financial impli-
 cations of this change. Some Uzbek language street and store signs can be seen with
 Latin script.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-he 1992 law on unions specifically proclaims that
 all workers have the right voluntarily to form and join unions of their choice, that
 trade unions themselves may voluntarily associate territorially or sectorally, and
 that they may choose their own international affiliations. Membership in trade
 unions is optional. The law also declares all unions independent of the State's ad-
 ministrative and economic bodies (except where provided for by law) and states that
 trade unions may develop their own charters, structure, and executive bodies and
 organize their own work.
 
 
 1117
 In practice, however, the overall structure of trade unions has not changed signifi-
 cantly since the Soviet period. Uzbekistan's independence has eliminated subordina-
 tion to the Soviet Union or Russia but has not altered the centralized trade union
 hierarchy, which remains dependent on the Government. No "alternative" central
 union structures exist. A few new professional associations and interest groups have
 been organized, such as a Union of Entrepreneurs, a Union of Renters, an Associa-
 tion of Private Physicians and Pharmacists, and one of lawyers. Their role, degree
 of independence from the Government, and strength are as yet uncertain. Some of
 these hope to play a significant role in licensing and otherwise regulating the eco-
 nomic activity of their members.
 According to the law, the Council of the Federation of Trade Unions (CFTU) has
 a consultative voice in the preparation of all legislation affecting workers and is en-
 titled to draft laws on labor and social issues. Trade unions are legally described
 as organizations that defend the right to work and protect jobs. They have lost their
 previous role in state planning and in the management of enterprises. The emphasis
 now is on the unions' responsibility for "social protection" and social justice--espe-
 cially unemployment compensation, pensions, and worker retraining.
 The trade union law does not mention strikes or cite a right to strike. However,
 the law does give the unions oversight over both individual and collective labor dis-
 putes, which are defined as those involving alleged violations of labor laws, worker
 rights, or collective agreements.
 There were few reports of strikes. Union and government officials alike assert
 that this reflects general support for the Government's policies and common interest
 in social stability. It probably also reflects the absence of truly representative trade
 unions as the standard of living fell, and growing unemployment raised social ten-
 sions. Worker collectives in rural areas conducted sit-ins and demonstrations for
 non-payment of salaries. In most cases the local government made arrangements for
 payment and the groups disbursed peacefully.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Trade unions may conclude
 agreements with enterprises. Privatization is in its very early phases, so there is
 no experience yet with negotiations that could be described as adversarial between
 unions and private employers. With very few exceptions, the State is still the major
 employer, and the state-appointed union leaders do not view themselves as having
 conflicts of interest with the State.
 The Ministry of Labor and the Ministry of Finance in consultation with the
 CFTU, set the wages for various categories of state employees. In the small private
 sector, management establishes wages or negotiates them with those who contract
 for employment.
 The law forbids discrimination against union members and their officers, and no
 complaints were registered.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Constitution specifically pro-
 hibits forced labor, except as legal punishment or as may be specified by law. Large-
 scale compulsory mobilization of youth and students (by closing schools) to help with
 the cotton harvest continues. Young people in rural areas are expected to participate
 "voluntarily" in harvesting activities o all kinds, and universities still shut down
 temporarily to send both students and faculty into the fields.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The minimum working age is 16;
 15-year-olds can work with permission but have a shorter workday. In the rural
 areas, younger children and the elderly often turn out to help harvest cotton and
 other crops. The Labor Ministry has an inspection service responsible for enforcing
 compliance with these and other regulations governing employment conditions.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-he Ministry of Labor, in consultation with the
 CFMU, sets the minimum wage. As of September 1, it was about $7.35 (250 Som)
 per month. The minimum wage is not sufficient to feed a family.
 The workweek is set at 41 hours per week and includes a 24-hour rest period.
 Some factories have apparently reduced work hours in order to avoid layoffs. Over-
 time pay exists in theory but is not always paid.
 The Labor Ministry establishes occupational health and safety standards in con-
 sultation with the unions. There is a health and safety inspectorate within the Min-
 istry. Workers do leave jobs that are hazardous without apparent jeopardy to contin-
 ued employment; but the local press occasionally published complaints about the
 failure of unions and government authorities to do enough to promote worker safety.
 Although written regulations may provide adequate safeguards, workers in hazard-
 ous jobs often lack protective clothing and equipment.
