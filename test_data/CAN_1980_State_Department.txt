 CANAD
 Canada is a constitutional monarchy with a federal system,
 parliamentary form of government and a strong democratic
 tradition. Its resource wealth and modern, industrial
 economy afford Canadians a high standard of living, and
 support a sophisticated and comprehensive system of
 government services. Parliament, the media, and the
 public are quick to react to any real or suspected
 infringement of human rights, not only in Canada but
 elsewhere in the world. Canada is a staunch supporter of
 United Nations resolutions and declarations on human
 rights. It has played a leading role in stimulating
 global concern for human rights abuses in such areas as
 Vietnam and Kampuchea, and in working to strengthen
 international human rights machinery. Traditionally a
 place of refuge for victims of oppression in other parts
 of the world, Canada responded to the Indochina refugee
 crisis with unprecedented generosity; 60,000 refugees from
 that region were resettled in Canada during 1979-80.
 Human rights in Canada are protected by the enforcement of
 a wide range of laws. In 1980 the government introduced
 legislation which would embody human rights in a new cons-
 titution and make any further actions in this field by the
 Parliament or provincial legislatures subject to review by
 the courts. This legislation is presently under consider-
 ation. Some provincial xremiers and opposition leaders in
 Parliament have questioned the wisdom of transferring
 responsibility for protection of human rights from elected
 legislators to the judiciary. Human rights spokesmen have
 commended some aspects of the Charter but have asked that
 others be strengthened to eliminate possible loopholes.
 Although the legislative protection of human rights falls
 under the jurisdiction of both federal and provincial
 governments, the specific guarantees discussed below are
 those in existence at the federal level, often reinforced
 by complementary provisions in provincial statutes.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 Torture is a practice contrary to the philosophy of
 Canadian criminal law and the principles governing the
 administration of security and penitentiary services. The
 Criminal Code prohibits the use of torture. (Sections 228,
 229, 245, 305, and 381.)
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 The Criminal code prohibits of use of cruel, inhuman or
 degrading treatment, and, under the 1960 Canadian Bill of
 Rights (a statute), any law of Canada which authorized
 such punishment would be held by the courts to be inoper-
 ative. The law is followed closely by policy and other
 law enforcement officials. The death penalty has been
 abolished for all crimes except certain offences against
 the Code of Service Discipline.
 c. Disappearances
 
 
 749
 Secret arrest or clandestine detention is contrary to law and
 does not take place in Canada.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 Under the Canadian Criminal Code, every person who has been
 arrested must, where it is feasible, be informed immediately
 of the warrant under which he or she has been arrested or of
 the reasons for arrest. In any case the accused minst be taken before
 a justice within 24 hrs of his arrest. 7he Bill of RBghts renders in-
 operative any law of Canada depriving a person of remedy by way
 of habeas corpus.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The Canadian Bill of Rights gives individuals charged in
 criminal proceedings the right to a public trial before an
 independent and impartial tribunal. More generally, in civil
 as well as criminal matters, the right to a public trial is
 one of the fundamental features of the Anglo-Canadian Legal
 System. Defendants have the right to counsel of their choice.
 Under Canada's Official Secrets Act, trials can be held in
 camera in matters involving espionage and similar crimes. The
 judiciary is an independent branch of government.
 f. Invasion of the Home
 The Criminal Code prohibits forcible entry into real property
 in the peacable possession of another. If a police officer,
 when not authorized to do so in law, conducts a search without
 a warrant, he becomes an intruder and subject to legal
 penalties. In late 1980 an official commission was completing
 work on its inquiry into alleged past civil rights abuses by
 the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, including surreptitious
 entry and illegal opening of mail. In general, Canadian law
 enforcement agencies enjoy a high regard and the attitude of
 Canadians toward them is supportive.
 2. Government Policies Relating to the Fulfillment of
 Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care and
 Education
 The Canadian Government has demonstrated a strong commitment
 to improving the lot of the poort. The federal and pro-
 vincial governments participate in social welfare programs.
 All Canadians are covered by a national medical and health
 insurance program. There is a comprehensive and generous
 program of unemployment insurance compensation administered
 y the Federal Department of Employment and Immigration.
 Over two million Canadians over 65 receive old-age security
 payments. Federal and provincial tax systems are progressive.
 Education is free up to Grade 13.
 Per capita GNP in 1979 was $9,401. Average weekly wages
 were $265.85. The inflation rate for 1979 was 9.1 per-
 cent, while unemployment stood at 7.5 percent. Real GNP
 grew at the rate of 2.7 percent in 1979. Canada is one of
 the few countries in the world which provide for full
 automatic indexing of income tax levels to adjust for
 inflation and maintain an equitable tax system. Taxes on
 inheritances and wealth in Canada are relatively low. An
 equalization system provides for transfers of revenue from
 the more prosperous provinces to those which are relatively
 less well-off.
 
 
 750
 Much emphasis has been placed on the fostering of a bilin-
 gual, multicultural society in which all may enjoy freedom
 from discrimination while maintaining distinct cultural
 identities with Canada. In particular, the official
 Languages Act of 1969 declared English and French to be
 equal in status, rights and privileges in all federal
 institutions. During the 1970's federal policies nearly
 doubled the percentage of officer ranks in the public
 service occupied by Francophone Canadians. At present,
 Quebec provincial law limits the right of Anglophone
 Canadians to be educated in Quebec in English. The
 Charter of Rights and Freedoms proposed for inclusion in
 the Constitution by the Federal Government in 1980 would
 ensure that Canadians belonging to either of the official
 language groups would have the right to educate their
 children in that language, wherever numbers warrant.
 Discrimination on the basis of sex is outlawed. A Cabinet
 Minister is specifically charged with responsibility for
 the status of women. A Federal Advisory Council on the
 Status of Women, consisting of thirty women with distin-
 guished records in business, government and social
 service, advises the Minister of Women's Affairs on the
 measures to maintain sexual equality within the public
 service and in federal enactments.
 Canadian labor unions enjoy notably wide freedom of
 action. Canadian law insures the right of labor in both
 the public and private sectors to associate freely,
 organize, and bargain collectively. Federal and pro-
 vincial legislation proscribes discrimination in union
 membership recruitment and employee hiring.
 3. Respect for Civil and political Liberties, including:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 The Canadian Bill of Rights recognizes freedom of reli-
 gion, freedom of speech, freedom of the press, freedom of
 association and freedom of assembly. The latter is
 subject to considerations of public order. Viewpoints
 representing the complete political spectrum are vigor-
 ously argued in newspapers and other publications across
 Canada and on the more than 2,000 publicly and privately-
 owned broadcasting stations. Some provinces maintain film
 censor boards.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration and Repatriation
 Canadian citizens enjoy well-established rights to enter,
 remain in, or leave Canada. However, federal spokesmen
 have expressed concern over provincial laws inhibiting
 non-residents of a province from carrying on work or
 owning land, and creating other barriers to the free flow
 of capital, labor and services throughout the Canadian
 economy. The Charter of Rights and Freedoms introduced by
 the Federal Government in 1980 as part of its constitu-
 tional resolution would strengthen the right of citizens
 and permanent residents of Canada to establish residence
 in any province and take up employment there.
 Since the end of World War II, Canada has welcomed over
 350,000 refugees. The program initially focused on dis-
 placed persons from Eastern Europe, but has broadened in
 scope to include Uganda, Chile and Indochina. Apart from
 
 
 the 60,000 Indochinese admitted in 1979-80, Canada's
 annual refugee plan for 1980 called for the admisssion of
 3,000 refugees from Eastern Europe, 500 from Latin
 America, 500 from other world areas, and a contingency
 reserve of 1,000 spaces, 300 of which were committed to
 accomodate Cubans who sought asylum in the Peruvian
 Embassy in Havana.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Legislative power is vested in the appointed Senate and in
 the House of Commons, whose members are elected through
 universal suffrage by secret ballot by adult Canadian
 citizens. Elections must be held at least every five
 years, and participation rates are high. Canadians have
 complete freedom to join the political party of their
 choice. In the 32nd Canadian general election held on
 February 18, 1980, more than 11 million Canadians, 69% of
 the registered voters, cast ballots.
 The Canadian Human Rights Commission has recommended that
 revised legislation affecting benefits to Canada's native
 Indian population be enacted which would end sexual dis-
 crimination inherent in the present Indian Act which
 denies Indian status, the right to tribal membership, and
 accompanying benefits to native women who marry men who
 are not Indians. Recent Federal Governments have declared
 their intention to correct this discriminatory feature.
 Women take an increasingly active part in Canadian
 political life. They are active in the parties and have
 representatives in the Parliament and in some of the
 provincial legislatures.
 4. Government Attitude and Record Regarding International
 and Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Canada has supported vigorously efforts to increase the
 authority of international bodies to investigate and deal
 with human rights abuses. An exhaustive report docu-
 menting Canada's observance of the International Covenant
 on Civil and Political Rights was presented to the United
 Nations Human Rights Committee in Geneva in March 1980 and
 has been widely distributed inside Canada. Canadian
 initiatives were instrumental in achieving major advances
 at the 1980 session of the UN Commision on Human Rights.
 Numerous mechanisms and institutions exist in.Canada for
 monitoring human rights practices. The Canadian Human
 Rights Commission, established in 1977, is charged with
 investigating and resolving complaints of discrimination
 in government and business activities under federal juris-
 diction, and combatting discrimination through infor-
 mation, education and research. The Commission's annual
 report published in May 1980 indicated that it had
 screened thousands of inquiries in 1979, handled 458
 specific discrimination complaints and recommended a broad
 range of new legislation expanding proscribed grounds of
 discrimination to include pregnancy, mental illness,
 sexual orientation and other criteria. Human rights
 commissions also have been established at the provincial
 level. Since 1975 a continuing Federal-Provincial Com-
 mittee of officials responsible for human rights has been
 in existence to provide a forum for intergovernmental
 discussion on matters related to human rights in Canada.
 
 
 752
 Canada's commissioner of Official Languages reviews public
 complaints over violations in statutory language rights
 which guarantee Canadians the right to deal with federal
 institutions in either French or English.
 Non-government human rights organizations and interest
 groups are also active in maintaining high public concern
 over human rights issues. The prominent role occupied by
 human rights considerations in Canada's external relations
 gained new public attention through a January 1980 confer-
 ence on foreign policy and human rights sponsored by the
 Canadian Human Rights Foundation and attended by senior
 government officials and private participants from across
 the country.
