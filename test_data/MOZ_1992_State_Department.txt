 MOZAMBIQUE
 In 1992 Mozambique continued to be governed by President Joaquim Chissano
 and the ruling National Front for the Liberation of Mozambique (FRELIMO). The
 multiparty elections called for in the 1990 Constitution were postponed pending the
 outcome of peace talks between the Government and the insurgent Mozambique Na-
 tional Resistance (RENAMO). On October 4, the Government and RENAMO signed
 a peace agreement formally ending the 1-year civil war and committing the coun-
 try to democratic elections within 1 year. In addition to the ceaee-fre, the October
 4 agreement addressed political party registration, organization of the electoral sys-
 tem, the size of the military, political amnesty, and oversight of the state intel-
 ligence service. Approximately 14 political parties were active in 1992. Only
 FREIO and the Mozambican National Union (UNAMO) met official registration
 requreents; however, four other parties submitted the required documentation in
 December and were awating official certification. RENAMO acquired status as a po-
 litical party as a result of the peace aceord.
 Estimates of the sie of the government security forces vary from 60,000 to
 92,000. These figures include the Armed Forces of Mozambique (FAM), a territorial
 force, and a people's militia. RENAMO claims a force of 21,000. The State Informa-
 tion and Security Service (SISE) replaced the Mozambican National Security Service
 (SNASP) in 1991. Unlike its predecessor, which was often charged with serious
 human rights abuses, SSE does not have the power to arrest and detain suspects,
 and there were no reprted incidents of abuses by the new security service in 1992.
 Under the terms of the peace agreement, the Government and RENO will merge
 their armies into a new national force of 30,000 soldiers to be known as the Mozam-
 bique Armed Defense Force (FADM). Those soldiers on both sides not chosen for the
 new force are to be demobilized. SISE is to be placed under the supervision of a
 21-member monitoring committee made up of representatives of the Government,
 RENAMO, and independent citizens. Mozambique's total military expenditures in
 1989, the last year for which the U S. Arms Control and Disarmament Agency con-
 ducted a detailed analysis, were $107 million. Significant reductions in these ex-
 penditures are expectedover  e next few years as the armed forces are reorganized
 and streamlined.
 Approximately 80 percent of the population is employed in agriculture, mostly on
 a small-scale, subsistence level. Major sources of foreign exchange are seafood and
 agricultural products, especially cashews, tea, sugar, and cotton. The Government
 continued its efforts to move to a market-oriented economy, but growth was ex-
 tremely poor for the second year in a row. The worst drought on record crippled ag-
 ricultural production and probably doubled the number of Mozambicans dependent
 on relief assistance for their survival. Continued attacks by RENAMO on economic
 targets severely hampered production and internal trade.
 Human rights abuses continued in 1992, with the most blatant arising out of the
 continuing  civil conflict. Widespread reports detailed  killings of civilians,
 kidnapings, torture, and looting. Though  N O  was responsile for many of
 these atrocities, government forces were guilty of serious abuses as well. Both
 RENAMO and, to a lesser extent, elements within the Government impeded and at-
 tempted to manipulate international humanitarian relief efforts for political and
 military advantage. Other major human rights problems included harsh prison con-
 ditions; incidents of military looting, extortion, and harassment of civilians; forced
 recruitment; and citizens' inability to change their government.
 In some aspects, however, the country's human rights record improved. Press.-
 freedom expanded with the launching of a new, privately owned news bulletin which
 has published articles critical of official cornuption and verment policies. Under
 new labor legislation, several unions officially registered and declared their de-
 
 
 176
 pendence from the FRELIMO-dominated labor federation. Though lacking financial
 resources and claiming government harassment, emerging political parties held con-
 gresses, issued press reases, and recruited members.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no known or suspected
 cases of the Government targeting persons for political killing in 1992. Both sides
 were responsible for the deaths of civilians in the course of the civil war, with the
 great majority of the killings attributed to RENAMO forces (see Section 1.g.).
 Outside the context of the war, there were also examples of government security
 forces using excessive force against arrested criminals. In August the authorities ar-
 rested members of the security forces for allegedly beating to death a man in cus-
 tody on charges of murder.
 In April President Chissano admitted publicly for the first time that several oppo-
 sition political leaders, missing since the late 1970's, had long since been executed
 by the Government on charges of treason. He did not specify the names of these
 persons nor the dates of their executions. It is assumed, however, that he was refer-
 ring to ex-FRELIMO leaders such as Uria Simango and Lazero Nkavandme, who
 were arrested by the Government in the 1970's. Several opposition parties, including
 one founded by Simango's son, have demanded that the Government explain what
 happened to these people and accept responsibility.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of government-perpetrated disappear-
 ances. However, thousands are missing due to the conflict, ofen as a result of
 kidnaping in areas affected by the war. There were frequent reports of RENAMO
 holding civilians, including children, against their will and ofen employing them as
 porters or forcibly impressing them into RENAM(Ys military.
 e. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution expressly prohibits torture. During the prosecution of the war,
 however, bth government and RENAMO forces tortured prisoners and civilians. Ac-
 cording to many reports, RENAMO beat and mutiatedpeople and forced family
 members to witness or participate in the torture of their relatives.
 Prison conditions throughout the country remained very poor, and there were
 again reports of assaults on prisoners by soldiers, police, and prison staff. Prisoners
 in Machava prison rioted in August after going 3 days without food. One prisoner
 was killed by police during the protest. In Quelimane prison a group of prisoners
 threatened violent action if reported incidents of sexual misconduct and corruption
 among prison personnel were not addressed. Overcrowding remained a serious prob-
 lem.
 Since 1988 the Government has allowed international human rights groups access
 to prisons where national security prisoners (mainly RENAMO soldiers and sym-
 pathizers) have been held, both those already convicted and those awaiting trial. In
 1992 the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) was also given access
 to prisoners held in military prisons.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The law requires that most detainees be
 charged or released within 30 days. However, persons accused of the most serious
 crimes, i.e., security offenses or those requiring a sentence of more than 8 years,
 may be detained for up to 84 days without being formally charged. With court ap-
 prval, such detainees may be held for two additional periods of 84 days while the
 police complete their investigation. The detainee's constitutional right to counsel
 and to contact relatives or friends is often not respected.
 In some cases, detainees may be released from prison while the investigation pro-
 ceeds, but the bail system in Mozambique remains ill defined. The law provides that
 if the prescribed period for investigation has been completed and no charges have
 been brought, the detainee must e released. In practice, however, this law is often
 ignored, in part because of the severe lack of administrative personnel and trained
 lawyers to monitor the judicial system. It is also ignored because citizens are often
 unaware of their rights, particularly those granted under the 1990 Constitution, and
 do not demand them. As a result, throughout much of 1992 there continued to be
 a large backlog of prisoners awaiting trial, despite reported government efforts to
 speed up pretrial investigations. Detainees often spend many months, even years,
 in pretrial status.
 The new Constitution expressly prohibits exile or the expulsion of any
 Mozambican citizen.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-Mozambique has two complementary formal jus-
 tice systems: the civil/criminal, which includes customary courts; and the military
 justice system. Both are under the administration of the Ministry of Justice. At the
 
 
 177
 apex of both systems is the Supreme Court. Military courts are administered jointly
 with the Ministry of Defense. Appeals, including military cases, may be made to the
 Supreme Court. Local customary courts handle matters such as estate and divorce
 cases, and usually proceedings are conducted in public by a trained representative
 of the Ministry o Justice, assisted by two to four popularly elected lay judges.
 Although all accused persons are in theory presumed innocent and have the right
 to legal counsel and the right of appeal, these rights are not always applied. The
 entire judicial process suffers severely from a shortage of trained personnel and the
 Government's inability to reduce a large backlog of cases. In 1992 the Government,
 with international assistance, began to develop a comprehensive plan for improving
 the professional level and efficiency of the judiciary.
 The 1990 Constitution formally established an independent judiciary and provides
 for the selection of judges by other jurists, replacing the prior system of administra-
 tively appointed justices. However, the President still appoints the members of the
 most important court, the Supreme Court; the FRELIMO-controlled Assembly also
 appoints a number of "lay judges" to that court. While in practice the executive
 often influences the judicial process, especially in political and security cases, there
 were few complaints in 1992 of overt government interference. In fact, in the highly
 publicized treason trial of Colonel General Sebastiao Mabote (see below), the Su-
 preme Court found the defendant innocent of the State's charges.
 Since the establishment of the Supreme Court in 1988 and the abolition of the
 revolutionary military tribunal, persons accused of crimes against the State are
 tried in common civilian courts under standard criminal judicial procedures. A judge
 may order a trial closed because of national security interests or to protect the pri-
 vacy of the plaintiff in cases concerning rape.
 According to credible sources, there were an estimated 400 to 550 security pris-
 oners held at the beginning of 1992. With the exception of those in detention for
 the 1991 conspiracy, all of-these prisoners were accused of sympathizing with or
 committing crimes on behalf of RENAMO. However the October 4 accords provided
 for the release of all such prisoners except those being held on common criminal
 charges, and on October 13 the Assembly of the Republic passed an act granting
 amnesty to persons charged with, or convicted of, committing security crimes
 against the State. As of the end of 1992, an estimated 300 political prisoners were
 reported released under this act.
 The most important security trials in 1992 involved General Mabote and 13 other
 civilian and military codefendants charged with conspiring to overthrow the Govern-
 ment in 1991. The public trials were held in civilian courts with legal counsel
 present. General Mabote, the most senior of the alleged coup plotters, was tried by
 three members of the Supreme Court due to his stafus as a senior military officer
 and deputy in the Assembly of the Republic. The others were tried in lesser courts.
 The Government presented little evidence to substantiate the charges, and General
 Mabote was ultimately found innocent of all charges. Charges were later dropped
 against the other defendants under the terms of the amnesty act cited above, and
 they were released.
 There have been reports that RENAMO has established some rudimentary civil
 administration in some areas under its control. The rebel group claims to use tradi-
 tional courts in these areas, with military commanders sometimes acting as judges.
 No independent information was available to confirm the existence of such courts
 or to shed further light on administration of justice in RENAMO areas.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-Despite
 constitutional provisions for privacy, police andsecurity forces entered homes at will
 in areas of active insurgency. The authorities also often force civilians to move to
 government-protected villas. In the "secure villages," the displaced live in harsh,
 overcrowded conditions and suffer from malnutrition, disease, and high mortality
 rates. Both RENAMO and the Government have forced citizens to resettle during
 the course of the war. Much of the resettlement that occurred in the country in
 1992, however, was self-initiated and driven by the severe drought and the search
 for food and water.
 It is widely assumed that surveillance devices are employed to monitor local and
 international telecommunications systems and that mail is periodically inspected,
 even though the new Constitution expressly prohibits such surveillance.
 g. Use of Excessive Force and Violations of Humanitarian Law in Internal Con-
 fl/cts.-Both government and RENAMO forces were again responsible for violations
 of humanitarin law in 1992. Since it began in the late 1970 s, the conflict is esti-
 mated to have cost as many as 1 million lives and lef millions more homeless and
 living on the edge of starvation.
 The failure of the Government to pay soldiers' salaries regularly led to a decline
 in discipline in the FAM. Demanding back pay, soldiers in several cities rioted, at-
 
 
 178
 tacking and sometimes killing citizens and destroying public property. There were
 numerous reports that government troops and security personnel eat and extorted
 money from civilians. Several soldiers were convicted of such crimes in 1992 and
 sentenced to prison terms, fines, and expulsion from the armed services (see Section
 2.a.).
 RENAMO attacks against civilians were reported frequently, and, given the re-
 motcness of much of the countryside, many more undoubtedly occurred but went un-
 reported. The rebel group continued to execute or kidnap noncombatants after at-
 tacks on villages. One respected international human rights group found that at-
 tacks on Mozambican -tizens were a "central part of RENAMO's strategy of adver-
 tising its presence and its strength and of terrorizing the local population." Shortly
 after the signing of the peace accord, RENAMO attacked and captured four district
 capitals, killing several civilians. There are also reliable reports of attacks on civil-
 ian targets by the FAM and the progovernment "Naparama* militia.
 Though forced recruitment ditninished in 1992, there were still examples of young
 men being impressed into the armed forces. RENAMO also continued to impress ci-
 vilians, including children, and to attack relief convoys, health workers, andclinics.
 Government forces conducting an operation near the Mozambique-South Africa
 border on January 16 claimed to have been attacked by unidentified elements who,
 they alleged, used a chemical agent which resulted in the deaths of at least 4 FAM
 soldiers. A U.N.-appointed team of experts which investigated the incident found no
 conclusive evidence of chemical weapons use. The team's report stated that the med-
 ical effect on the troops was consistent both with the use of an atropine-like agent
 and also with severe heat stress.
 Both RENAMO and (to a lesser extent) the Government blocked humanitarian re-
 lief deliveries to some drought-stricken regions of the country by refusing road ac-
 cess to contested areas, placing land mines, and, in the case of RENAMO, attacking
 relief convoys. As a result, tens of thousands of Mozambicans faced with starvation
 were forced to flee their homes. Following the signing of the peace accord in Octo-
 ber, both sides began to cooperate somewhat more readily with relief agencies.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution and new press laws in connec-
 tion with the peace accord provide for freedom of expression and of the press, but
 with restrictions in cases involving national defense considerations. Legally, criti-
 cism of the President is notprohibited, but in practice no articles or reports critical
 of him appeared in 1992. The 1991 press law holds that in cases of defamation
 against the President truth is not a sufficient defense against libel. Through the end
 of 1992, this law had not yet been tested in court.
 On balance, freedom of the press continued to improve in 1992. The media, par-
 ticularly television and radio, reported more objectively on a range of controversial
 topics, including corruption, government conspiracy trials, military indiscipline, and
 political opposition viewpoints. Several journalists aggressively pushed the bound-
 aries of press freedom, and the National Organization of Journalists was vocal in
 support of an independent media.
 owever, even though there is no formal prior press censorship in Mozambique
 journalists are held to unwritten and vague guidelines by their media directors, who
 are, in turn, appointed by the Government. After a series of hard-hitting reports
 critical of the regime in Maputo's major newspaper, the government-owned Noticias,
 the Government imposed in mid-1992 stricter controls over that newspaper's report-
 ing, directing that the editorial line be more supportive of the Government.
 Opposition political parties received wide and consistent coverage on radio and
 television but complained that they were often ignored by Noticias. Carlos Reis,
 President of the Mozambican National Union (UNAMO), blamed the Government
 for "sabotaging" one of his political party's press conferences when no media rep-
 resentatives attended, although journalists claimed they never received an invita-
 tion .                     "1
 The media reported extensively on the arrest of a military attorney who launched
 a widely publicized investigation into military corruption early in 1992. The attor-
 ney was briefly detained by the Minister of Defense when it was learned he was
 planning to give a speech to journalists on military corruption. Local television
 showed the attorney being taken away by military police moments before his talk
 was to begin. He was quickly released after the intervention of the Attorney Gen-
 eral, but his investigation later foundered, in part due to lack of funds.
 In the months leading up to the signing of the general peace accord, the official
 media gave greater and more objective coverage to RENAMO, including their first-
 ever interview with RENAMO president Afonso Dhlakama. New laws mandated by
 
 
 the peace accords guarantee equal access for all political parties to all media outlets.
 How this will work in practice however, remains to be seen.
 The Higher Council of Social Communication (a self-governing media organization
 mandated by the 1991 press law and designated to arbitrate, hear complaints, and
 set media guidelines) did not begin operations in 1992, thereby preventing Journal-
 ists from arbitrating cases in 1992. However one journalist, dismissed from Noticias
 for a commentary critical of FRELIMO leaders, received indemnity in an unprece-
 dented out-of-court settlement.
 Until 1992 almost all media were government owned. In 1992 the first independ-
 ent daily bulletin, Mediafax, was launched. The bulletin, which is faxed to subscrib.
 ere, ran a series of ground-breaking reports on corruption, the Mabote trial, and the
 Rome peace talks. Its reports were often picked up by the government-owned radio
 and television. Several other groups announced plans to launch private radio and
 television stations, though they were unable to proceed in 1992 due to the lack of
 enabling legislation. Foreign journalists are welcome, and foreign radio broadcasts
 and television are received without interference.
 No formal restrictions on academic freedom exist, but in practice teachers rou-
 tinely adhere to a self-censorship similar to that of the media. In 1992 there were
 credible reports that the Ministry of Education, in retaliation against striking sec-
 ondary school teachers, reassigned some teachers to other schools or withheld their
 salaries.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 freedom of assembly and association. No groups were known to have been denied
 permission to hold public marches in 1992. Most marches, however, were govern-
 ment sponsored or condoned, often in support of the peace process. One unauthor-
 ized march was led by a group of disabled war veterans who blocked a national
 highway for 2 days in August to protest the Government's failure to pay pensions.
 Though the protest remained generally peaceful, one veteran was killed by police
 called to the scene to restore order and open the highway.
 Legislation enacted in 1991 set up guidelines for regring as a political party,
 as well as for holding public demonstrations. In general, political groups during the
 year held congresses and press conferences, traveled freely around the country and
 recruited supporters with little interference. However, there were incidents of offi-
 cial harassment. In August for example, Zambezia province judicial authorities or-
 dered the arrest of Carlos Reis head of UNAMO, on a 1985 conviction in absentia
 for "speculation." Court officias maintained that the decision to arrest Reis was
 made by the Zambezia courts and was legally justifiable. However, many domestic
 and international groups criticized the arrest, and after 10 days the court released
 Reis. He and other opposition parties blamed FRELIMO for the arrest and insisted
 it was another example of official harassment of the new political parties.
 Under new legislation approved in October, a legally recognized political party
 must demonstrate that it has no racial ethnic or religious exclusiveness and secure
 at least 2,000 signatures of support f&m within the country. During the year, six
 political parties submitted the necessary documentation to register officially. At
 year's end, the Government had officially certified two of these--FRELIMO and
 UNAMO-and was reviewing the applications of the others. Under the provisions
 of the October peace agreement, RENAMO received political party status without
 having to meet registration requirements in advance.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution mandates strict separation of church
 and state and provides for the freedom to "practice or not practice a religion." The
 Government does not require religious organizations or missionaries to register, and
 foreign missionaries are readily granted visas. The 1990 Constitution gives religious
 institutions the right to own property and allows them to operate schools. Relations
 between the Government and religious organizations, tense in the early years after
 independence, continued to improve in 1992. The Government continued to return
 properties expropriated from religious organizations in the postindependence period,
 maintaining that only logistical problems prevented it from having returned all
 church property by year's end.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Constitution provides for freedom to travel within the country and
 abroad. The Government no longer requires citizens to obtain permits from local au-
 thorities in order to travel within the country. Along with the civil conflict, the con-
 tinuing drought caused mass internal migrations in search of food, water, and safe-
 ty.
 There are an estimated 3.6 million internally displaced people, living mainly in
 camps scattered throughout the country or in sprawling slums on the outskirts of
 the larger cities. In these camps, they receive emergency aid from the Government
 and from the international community. From 1.5 to2 millinn MmzRmhibCiRes awiv lpft
 
 
 180
 
 their homes for refuge in neighboring countries. Over half have gone to Malawi,
 while others have resettled in South Africa, Zimbabwe, Tanzania, Zambia, and Swa-
 ziland.
 The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) continued to work
 with Mozambican and neighboring government officials to plan for repatriation of
 refugees. Because of the drought and the ongoing conflict, voluntary repatriation
 was minimal throughout most of 1992. However, after the signing of the peace ac-
 cord and the subsequent return of rains, an estimated 70,000 refugees returned to
 Mozambique in the last 3 months of the year, according to the UNHCR. Involuntary
 repatriation of Mozambicans from South Africa continued unabated in 1992. The
 Government readily accepts and aids repatriates.
 There are few refugees from other countries in Mozambique. At the end of 1992,
 only 269 refugees were registered with the UNHCR. There were no reported cases
 in which refugees were forced to return to countries where they might have a well-
 founded fear of persecution.  �
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 In 1992 citizens still did not have the ability to change their government by demo-
 cratic means. The President, the FRELIMO political commission, and the Council
 of Ministers continued to control policymaking and implementation and will remain
 in office pending future elections. However, the new Constitution officially ended the
 leading role of the FRELIMO party, and the Rome peace agreement established a
 timetable for the country's first democratic elections as well as an independent mon-
 itoring system to ensure their fairness. Under the Rome accord, nationwide elections
 for President and for the Assembly are to be held simultaneously within 1 year of
 the October 4, 1992, signing of the general peace accord, with balloting guaranteed
 to be secret. An electoral commission made up of members of FRELIMO, RENAMO,
 and other political parties will organize and direct the election process. The agree-
 ment also allows for international election observers to be supervised by the United
 Nations.
 Under the general peace accord, RENAMO will be an equal partner in supervising
 and monitoring the electoral process, the cease-fire and demobilization of the armed
 forces. The Rome peace agreement accorded RENAMO the right to participate in the
 civil administration of areas it nominally controlled at the time of the peace agree-
 ment. At year's end, though, it remainedunclear how this arrangement would work
 in practice.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 A local human rights monitoring group was formed in Maputo in 1992, though
 it remained in the embryonic stage at year's end. There are no legal obstacles to
 the formation of such groups. The Government is also receptive to some inter-
 national human rights monitoring groups, including the ICRC, which maintains of-
 fices in six cities. The Government allowed Africa Watch to visit and interview pris-
 oners, leading Africa Watch to write in its annual report that the cooperation of the
 Mozambican Government was unprecedented in Africa. The government-owned
 media gave prominent coverage to the Africa Watch report.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Language, or Social Status
 The Constitution prohibits discrimination based on race, sex, or religion, and, in
 practice, there does not appear to be any systematic persecution on the basis of
 these factors. Nonetheless, the FRELIMO Government has tended to include at all
 levels a disproportionate number of southerners, mostly from the Shangana ethnic
 group. The Government also includes white, Asian, and mixed-race Mozambicans.
 This is not the case, however,' in the military where no whites and few mixed-race
 Mozambicans and Asians serve. Some observers, both Mozambican and foreign, be-
 lieve that the high percentage of southerners and persons who are not black in gov-
 ernmental positions results from the greater educational opportunities available to
 these groups under the former colonial administration, and not from deliberate, dis-
 criminatory government policies.
 The leadership of the RENAMO insurgents is predominantly from the Shona-
 speaking ethnic groups concentrated in the center of the country. There is no indica-
 tion that the con flict between the Government and RENAMO is primarily motivated
 by ethnicity, although ethnic and regional factors may play some role, and tribal fac-
 tors may explain some of the violence. Historical accident a ppears to be responsible
 for the ethnic composition of the RENAMO leadership; the Shona was the group cul-
 turally and geographically most accessible to the Southern Rhodesian intelligence
 organization, which established the forerunner to RENAMO in the late 1970's. Since
 
 
 181
 then RENAMO has recruited from all ethnic groups and has not significantly em-
 phasized ethnic issues in its communiques or in its negotiating positions. It has,
 however criticized FRELIMO for being dominated by southerners.
 The donstitution forbids discrimination on the basis of sex and mandates equal
 rights and responsibilities for women. Family law requires that women have equal
 property rights and rights over the children in any marriage. In practice, women
 are underrepresented in the professions and in educational institutions at all levels.
 Over 80 percent of Mozambican women are peasant farmers, and most have had lit-
 tle education or access to good health care. Mozambique has one of the highest ma-
 ternal mortality rates in the world.
 According to medical and other sources, violence against women, especially wife
 beating, is fairly widespread in Mozambique, especially in rural areas. The police
 do not normally intervene in domestic disputes and cases are rarely brought before
 the courts. The Government has not addressed the issue specifically andits influ-
 ence is weak, especially in many rural areas affected by the war. Female genital
 mutilation (circumcision) exists and is found most frequently in coastal areas, par-
 ticularly among Muslim groups.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The 1990 Constitution specifies that all workers are
 free to join or not join a trade union. A new labor law passed in December 1991
 further protects workers' rights to organize and to engage in union activity at their
 place of employment. The new legislation, which gave existing unions-those cre-
 ated as appendages of the FRELIMO-dominated Organization of Mozambican Work-
 ers (OTM)-the right to register independently, set the stage for the development
 of a more dynamic and democratic labor movement. Despite OTM resistance, by
 year's end nine unions had officially registered, three of which had announced they
 would no longer affiliate with the OTM.
 The Constitution explicitly provides for the right to strike, with the exception of
 government employees, police, military personnel, and employees of other essential
 services. Nonetheless, there were several incidents in 1992 of soldiers striking,
 blocking highways, and looting stores to protest the Government's failure to pay
 them. Wildcat strikes occurred in almost every sector during 1992 and were particu-
 larly widespread among teachers. Due to the unsettled state of labor unions
 throughout 1992, rost labor disputes were arbitrated through ad hoc workers com-
 mittees, formally recognized by the Government.
 The unions have been constrained in the past from asserting themselves on labor-
 management problems due to a lack of resources, as well as the conservative influ-
 ence of the Government and FRELIMO. It is too early to tell whether their new
 atus will increase their effectiveness.
 e Consuon nd labor legislation guarantee unions the right to join and par-
 ticipate in international bodies. The OTM is a member of the Organization of Afri-
 can Trade Union Unity and the Southern African Trade Union Coordinating Coun-
 cil. By year's end, the newly independent unions were actively trying to expand
 their contacts with international trade union organizations.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The labor law protects work-
 ers' rights to organize and to engage in collective bargaining. It expressly prohibits
 discrimination against organized labor. In late 1991, the Government decreed that
 it would no longer set al[ salary levels. Negotiating wage increases was left in the
 hands of the existing unions. During most of 1992, workers chose to bargain with
 employers through legally recognized ad hoc committees, with mixed results. The
 law requires government arbitration if labor and management fail to reach agree-
 ment. The majority of labor disputes dealt with management's failure to meet salary
 and other contractual obligations. Several strikes were aimed at removing company
 officials thought to be incompetent or corrupt.
 There are currently no export processing zones in Mozambique.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced or compulsory labor is pro-
 hibited by law, and there have been no reports of such labor practices by the Gov-
 ernment. There were continued reports of forced conscription by the FAM.
 RENAMO reportedly kidnaped civilians to perform various support functions, in-
 cluding portering arms and supplies and grwing food for combatants.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Chidren.--Chld labor is regulated by the
 Ministry of Labor. In the wage economy the minimum working age is 16. Because
 of high adult unemployment, there are few children in regular wage positions. How-
 ever, children commonly work on family farms or in the urban informal sector,
 where they perform such tasks as watching cars or collecting scrap metal. In addi-
 tion, many children are kidnaped by RENAMO and forced to serve as soldiers or
 laborers.
 
 
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The Government sets minimum wage rates ad-
 ministratively. The Ministry of Labor is responsible for enforcing them in the pri-
 vate sector, the Ministry of Finance in the public sector. Violations of minimum
 wage rates are usually investigated only after workers register a complaint. It is
 customary for workers to receive benefits such as transportation and food. The mini-
 mum wage is not adequate to sustain an average urmn worker's family. Workers
 must turn to second jobs if available, as well as work garden plots to survive. An
 estimated 80 percent of the work force is engaged in subsistence agriculture which
 is not covered by minimum wage legislation. The standard legal workweek is 44
 hours.
 In the small, modern sector, the Government has enacted health and environ-
 mental laws to protect workers. On occasion, the Government has closed firms for
 noncompliance with these laws, but enforcement by the Ministry of Labor is irregu-
 lar, particularly under current, poor economic conditions.
