 SPAIN
 Spain is a parliamentary democracy with a constitutional monarch, King Juan
 Carlos I. In free and open elections held in June 1993, Prime Minister Felipe Gon-
 zalez was reelected to a fourth term, albeit as head of a minority government.
 The security forces are under the full control of the government; allegations of
 human rights abuse are investigated, and those found guilty are punished by law.

 Spanish security services maintain anticorruption brigades that investigate allega-
 tions of fraud and dishonesty within each service. Since 1989, a Special Advisor or
 Human Rights in the Ministry of the Interior has been in charge of promoting hu-
 manitarian law and training senior members of law enforcement groups in human
 rights issues. Charges of police abuse of detainees were being investigated at year's
 end.
 The economy is market based, with primary reliance on private initiative, al-
 though there are still a sizable number of public sector enterprises. The economy
 lapsed into recession in 1992 and was expected to decline by approximately 1 per-
 cent in 1993. High unemployment, amounting to approximately 22 percent as of
 September 1993, continued, due in part to the entry of large numbers of people into
 the labor force.
 The fundamental rights of freedom of speech, assembly, press, religion, movement,
 and participation in the political process are provided for in the Constitution of 1978
 and are respected in practice. The Basque Fatherland and Freedom Separatist
 Group (ETA) continued to wage a protracted campaign of terrorism, although the
 number of incidents declined in 1993. The Government's efforts to bring individual
 terrorists to justice resulted in accusations by detainees of ill-treatment. In late. Sep-
 tember, two suspected ETA collaborators died while in police custody due to cir-
 cumstances that by year's end had not been fully explained. Preliminary reports by
 the state coroner and police investigations failed to find any evidence of irregular
 police action. Other human rights problems included de facto discrimination against
 Gypsies and increasing reports of police mistreatment of illegal aliens.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no known political
 killings by government forces. In late September, two suspected ETA collaborators
 died while in police custody, one as a result of cardiac arrest and the other from
 injuries incurred when, according to police, he fell from a second-story window.
 Prime Minister Gonzalez pledged complete "transparency" in the Government's in-
 vestigation of the deaths until the incidents were fully explained. By year's end, in-
 vestiations had not found any evidence of wrongdoing by police authorities. A
 prominent nongovernmental human rights organization launched its own investiga-
 tion into the incidents.
 The death of an American citizen after fleeing police in the Canary Islands in
 1992 has not been fully explained and remains under investigation by Spanish judi-
 cial authorities. Spanish courts found no evidence of police wrongdoing and initially
 ordered the case to be closed.. However, the family's lawyer contested this resolution,
 and the case continued under investigation at year's end. It is customary in many
 Spanish regions for investigations to take as long as a year, sometimes longer.
 Frequent terrorist incidents continued during 1993, although those resulting in
 deaths or serious injuries decreased significantly. Between January and September,
 14 terrorist-related attacks resulted in 14 deaths and 37 injuries. As in previous
 years, the vast majority of those killed were members of the Guardia Civil and the
 National Police. Ten of the deaths were attributed to ETA, one to the First of Octo-
 ber Anti-Fascist Group (GRAPO), and one to the Basque group Iraultza Aske.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no claims during 1993 that police or government
 security forces carried out secret arrests or kidnapings.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Spanish law prohibits the use of torture or other cruel, inhuman, or degrading treat-
 ment. Despite these provisions, detainees charged with terrorism continue to assert
 that they are abused during detention. Persons arrested for criminal offenses some-
 times made similar charges. The Government had difficulty in credibly refuting such
 charges because, under the law, suspected terrorists may be held incommunicado for
 5 days. Regarding the early 1992 charges of police abuse of 28 suspected ETA de-
 tainees, at the end of 1993 investigations were continuing, and 9 civil guard sus-
 pects had been named, according to a prominent nongovernmental organization. Re-
 garding 16 prison guards in Catalonia charged with brutality, no formal results of
 the investigations had been announced by year's end.
 The media regularly reported alleged police mistreatment of northern and sub-Sa-
 haran Africans, particularly Moroccans, although there were no confirmed cases of
 abuse. Police in Valencia in March initiated an investigation into mistreatment of
 a Moroccan citizen during a routine identification check. Authorities had not an-
 nounced the results of the investigation by year's end.
 In February the Ombudsman released his 1992 report to the Parliament in which
 he denounced the "clearly racist and xenophobic attitudes" of many law enforcement
 
 
 1063
 officials in their dealings with foreigners, particularly at airports and other ports
 of entry.
 Passengers on board a Moroccan ferry which docked in the port of Algeciras re-
 ported that when Spanish Civil Guards boarded the vessel to check documents, a
 racus ensued in which the guards beat several of the passengers, including women
 and children. There was no apparent followup on this case.
 The Ombudsman received 31 complaints of police abuse in 1992. The Ombudsman
 condemned prison overcrowding.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution prohibits arbitrary ar-
 rest and detention, and normally a suspect may not be held for more than 3 days
 without a judicial hearing. Detainees have the right to counsel of their choice unless
 they are suspected of being terrorists, in which case legal counsel is appointed by
 the Government. A suspected terrorist may be held up to 5 days without a hearing
 and without access to an attorney or family members. Exile is not practiced.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution provides for an independent judi-
 ciary and the right to a fair public trial. This right is observed in practice. The judi-
 cial structure comprises territorial, provincial, regional, and municipal courts with
 the Supreme Tribunal at its apex. The Constitutional Tribunal has jurisdiction over
 constitutional issues. The European Court of Human Rights is the final arbiter in
 cases concerning human rights.
 Defendants have the right to be represented by an attorney, at state expense for
 the indigent. The right to be released on bail is guaranteed, unless the court has
 reason to believe a suspect may flee or constitutes a serious threat to public safety.
 Suspects may not be confined for more than 2 years before being brought to trial,
 unless a further delay is authorized by a judge. The period of pretrial custody may
 be extended up to 6 years, at the judge's discretion. In practice, pretrial custody gen-
 erally is less than 1 year. However, the Ombudsman's report for 1992 criticized
 ever- increasing delays in judicial proceedings. In cases of petty crime, suspects re-
 leased on bail may face a wait of as long as 5 years before trial. Following convic-
 tion, defendants may appeal to the next higher court. A Supreme Court judge com-
 plained publicly in January about criticism from members of the Government and
 the governing Socialist Party (PSOE) for his ongoing investigation of allegations of
 improper campaign financing practices. In February the second division of the Su-
 preme Court directed the judge to suspend his investigation and submit a report on
 his fimdings within 10 days.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution protects the privacy of the home and correspondence. Under the Crimi-
 nal Code, government authorities must obtain court approval before searching pri-
 vate property, wiretapping, or interfering with private correspondence. The
 antiterrorist law gives discretionary authority to the Minister of the Interior to act
 prior to obtaining court approval "in cases of emergency." In February 1992, the
 Parliament passed legislation called the Citizen's Security Law, broadening police
 authority to search certain residences and detain citizens without a court order. The
 law, intended to aid in the fight against narcotics trafficking and terrorism, was
 passed despite strong criticism from the opposition parties that it was unconstitu-
 tional. In November 1993, the Constitutional Court, in a unanimous ruling, declared
 unconstitutional a key provision of the law which permitted law enforcement au-
 thorities to conduct searches without a warrant in certain circumstances. The
 Court's ruling reportedly jeopardized about 800 arrests over the previous 2 years
 which were based on warrantless searches and an unknown number of convictions
 and was a key factor in the resignation of the Interior Minister who originally au-
 thored the law.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-Freedom of speech and the press are provided
 for in the Constitution, and the Government observes these provisions. Opposition
 viewpoints, beth from political parties and other organizations, are freely aired and
 are widely reflected in the media.
 In late September, the Supreme Court ruled that an interruption of a 1981 speech
 by the King in the Basque region by members of ETA's political wing, Herri
 Batasuna (-iB), was a valid exercise of freedom of expression. This was considered
 a landmark decision, given the broad respect the royal family commands and the
 Government's opposition to HB. The hecklers, who were not held in custody, were
 tried under a law prohibiting insults against the royal family.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-As provided in the Constitu-
 tion, all groups have the right of free assembly and association for political or other
 purposes. This right is fully respected and freel'y practiced.
 
 
 1064
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution guarantees freedom of religion. There
 is no state religion. Roman Catholicism is the predominant religion, and the Catho-
 lic Church receives official funding. However, other religions are represented and
 function with full freedom.
 In February, 1990 the Government concluded accords with federations of Spanish
 Jews and Protestants which ended a state of official legal discrimination against
 those two religions. The accords placed Protestants and Jews on an equal legal foot-
 ing with Catholics, except in the matter of financial support from the Government,
 which both groups had renounced. Protestant, Muslim, and Jewish, as well as
 Catholic, students now have the right to receive separate religious instruction in
 public schools. In April 1992 the Parliament passed legislation reaffirming the legal
 equality of all religions, including that of Islam.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-Citizens have complete freedom to travel within and outside the coun-
 try. The Government restricts neither emigration nor repatriation. The law on ille-
 gal aliens permits detention of a person for up to 40 days prior to expulsion but
 specifies that the detention may not take place in a prison-like setting.
 Refugee and asylum cases are adjudicated by an interministerial commission.
 Generally, the Government grants refugee status on the recommendations of the
 Ur'ted Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Spain is a multiparty democracy with open elections in which all citizens 18 years
 of age and over have the right to vote for Parliament as well as for provincial and
 local bodies. At all levels of government, elections must be held every 4 years. The
 most recent elections were general legislative elections in June 1993.
 Spanish politics contain an important regional element which is particularly
 strong in Catalonia and the Basque country. These two "autonomous communities
 are similar to U.S. states. Governmental power in Spain is shared between the
 central Government and 17 regional "autonomous communities," each with its own
 specific powers. The Catalan and Basque regions are ruled by regional parties which
 reflect the desires of many Catalans and Basques to give political expression to their
 own linguistic and cultural identities. These parties provide democratic alternatives
 to separatist qroups which advocate achieving independence through terrorist vio-
 lence. The regional parties' influence on the national level has increased by virture
 of the Government's minority position in the Parliament.
 Participation of women in the political process continued to increase. However,
 under Spain's electoral system, the percentage of votes won determines the number
 of candidates elected from the party list; hence a candidate's place on the list is cru-
 cial in determining election. Since many women candidates were placed in the lower
 half of the lists, the number elected has never reached 25 percent. Nevertheless, the
 number of women occupying prominent governmental positions continued to grow.
 Of the 350 newly eleted Members of Parliament, 55 are women. At year's end, 3
 of the 16 cabinet ministers were women, and there were 3 female Ambassadors in
 the Foreign Ministry.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 A number of nongovernmental human rights groups, including the Human Rights
 Association of Spain and the Human Rights Institute of Catalonia in Barcelona op-
 erate freely without government interference. The Government cooperates read y
 with international organizations investigating allegations of human rights abuses,
 such as the European Commission of Hiuman Rights and international nongovern-
 mental human rights groups, as well as with independent national groups.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution provides for equal rights for all citizens, and an independent
 Ombudsman actively investigates complaints of human rights abuses by the au-
 thorities.
 Women.-While Spanish women have in recent years moved towards equality
 under the law increased their access to the educational system, and entered the
 work force in larger numbers, traditional attitudes continued to result in de facto
 discrimination. There is considerable regional variation in the extent of such dis-
 crimination. The Government's initiatives on behalf of women included the estab-
 lishment in 1983 of the Women's Institute, which seeks to promote social, political,
 and economic equality. In 1993 an updated draft of the Women's Institute 1988 Plan
 for Equality of Opportunities for Women went into effect. Its essential provisions in-
 
 
 1065
 cluded establishing a working grup between relevant ministries and women's
 groups aimed at assisting battere and sexually molested women; facilitating access
 to .ob search information networks; and promoting equal sharing of family respon-
 sibilities.
 Although one-third more women (mainly those younger than 29 years of age) work
 outside the home than a decade ago, the incidence of such employment in Spain is
 still quite low. There are relatively few women in leadership positions in business,
 industry, or government. Women's pay still lags behind that of men. The 1993 Plan
 for Equality of Opportunities addressed this issue by developing programs aimed at
 subsidiing indefinite hiring contracts (versus lower paying temporary ones) and by
 promoting management training programs for women.
 Sexual abuse, violence, and harassment of women in the workplace continued to
 be areas of stated governmental concern, but most such abuses were probably not
 reported, owing in part to the unsympathetic attitudes of police and judicial person-
 nel. However, the number of reported cases has grown in recent years. The Women's
 Institute has charged that some judges are reluctant to get involved in what they
 feel should remain a domestic problem. Similarly, in smaller towns some police ofi-
 cers have been reluctant to accept complaints from battered women. To deal with
 this problem, the Ministry of the Interior initiated a program in 1986 that created
 special sections within the Police Department to deal with violence against women,
 staffed by specially trained women officers. Women's groups and other relevant non-
 governmental organizations have supported this program, the impact of which is
 widely regarded as very positive.
 Severa levels of government provide institutional remedies, such as shelters for
 battered women. The Government attempts through educational programs to change
 public attitudes that contribute to violence against women. In 1989 the Parliament
 passed a law prohibiting verbal and physica harassment in the workplace, but no
 cases had been tried under this law by the end of 1993.
 Children.-The Ministry of Social Affairs is charged with looking after the rights
 and welfare of children. Through a directorate tasked with protecting the rights of
 minors, the Government has pursued programs aimed at preventing discrimination
 against teenagers and children. Specific offices of this directorate deal with adoption
 and family sheltering. The Ministry also has a Center for Studies of the Underaged
 and a Youth Institute charged with promoting social programs for teenagers and
 children.
 In early 1993, authorities discovered the bodies of three teenage girls who had
 been raped, tortured, and subsequently killed. The investigation raised a national
 outrage because one of the suspected criminals was a convict who had failed to re-
 turn to custody after a weekend leave. The incident led the Ministry of Social Af-
 fairs to press for stiffer penalties and denial of jail passes for rapists. By year's end,
 no legislation had been passed as a direct result of the Ministry's requests.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-Gypsies, a minority group representing 3
 percent of the population, continue to suffer de facto discrimination in housing,
 schools, and jobs. Legal mechanisms exist by which the Gypsies may seek redress,
 and the Government has stated its commitment to securing equal rights and treat-
 ment for them. The municipal government in Madrid began a program in 1991 to
 relocate Gypsy families living in shacks on the outskirts of the capital to housing
 mrojects in established communities and toughened enforcement of existing antidrug
 aws to assuage fears that such relocations would increase drug-related crime. In
 1993 the program, however, ran into funding problems and was discontinued.
 Human rights groups and media continued to give increasing attention to the
 question of human rights for the growing numbers of illegal immigrants from north-
 ern and sub-Saharan Africa. Discontent was particularly acute in the case of South
 Americans, especially Peruvians and Dominicans. Their discontent resulted pri-
 marily from the lack of equal economic opportunities and disrespectful treatment by
 bureaucratic authorities.
 There were sporadic racist and antiforeigner attacks throughout Spain, some of
 which involved local police. For example an African-American student was attacked
 and beaten by a group of "skinheads." He ran to a nearby building and called the
 police, but they refused to come to the scene and insisted he go to the station to
 file a complaint. Other allegations of racist and antiforeigner incidents included re-
 fusal of service at restaurants and harassment by police.
 In an effort to mitigate the increasing problem of antiforeigner violence, the Min-
 istry of Social Affairs initiated a campaign entitled "Democracy is Equality" aimed
 at sensitizing the Spanish public to immigrants and at diminishing violence against
 minorities. At least 12 nongovernmental organizations collaboratedin the campaign.
 The campaign used large billboards and television and radio commercials through-
 out Spain to promote equal treatment for Jews, homosexuals, the handicapped, and
 
 
 1066
 
 racial minorities. Among other themes, the campaign used Spanish immigration to
 Northern Europe after the Civil War as a means of reminding the public that Span-
 ish immigrants also had once benefited from opportunities abroad.
 A group of parents from Spanish-speaking households in Catalonia staged dem-
 onstrations to protest the Catalan Government's refusal to order that their chil-
 dren's schools provide instruction in Castilian. The Catalan Government's language
 instruction policy is aimed at making Catalan the language of preference, with Cas-
 tilian a second language. Each school, in consultation with parents and the local
 municipality, decides the mix of Catalan and Castilian to be used. In most primary
 schools, most classes for children up to 8 are taught in Catalan, with more Castilian
 added to the mix from age 9 on. Some Castilian-speaking parents feel their children
 are at a disadvantage when forced into an educational system tought predominantly
 in Catalan.
 People with Disabilities.-Since 1982 a law for the integration of disabled citizens
 has been in effect. It aims at ensuring fair access to public employment, preventing
 disability, and facilitating physical accessibility for the disabled. The law has had
 a dramatic effect in such key areas as providing access for the handicapped to public
 buildings and ensuring them parking areas, although it did not re  ire  hysical ac-
 cessibility. In 1993 the Autonomous Community in Madrid passed locaI legislation
 requiring that all new construction be adapted to the needs of the handicapped.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-All workers, except those in the military services,
 judges, magistrates, and prosecutors, are entitled to form or join unions of their own
 choosing without previous authorization. The only requisites for organizing a union
 are the formation of a group of more than two workers and registration with the
 Ministry of Labor and Social Security, which is routinely granted. Spain has over
 200 registered trade unions. The only union presently in existence that is not legally
 registered is the Unified Trade Union of the Guardia Civil, which the Constitutional
 Court ruled in 1986 could not be registered as it purports to represent military per-
 sonnel barred from unionization by the Constitution.
 Under the Constitution, trade unions are free to choose their own representatives,
 determine their own policies, represent their members' interests, and strike. They
 are not restricted or harassed by the Government and are independent of political
 parties. A strike in nonessential services is legal when it fulfills the requirement
 of 5 days' prior notice. Strikes must respect legal minimum service requirements,
 which are negotiated between the employer and the unions. Strikes occur frequently
 in Spain, although most are of short duration. Data for 1992 revealed the highest
 rate of working days lost to strikes, including a May 28 nationwide strike, since
 1988, while preliminary data for 1993 showed many fewer lost days, likely a con-
 sequence of the country's economic recession.
 Spanish unions are free to form or join federations and confederations and affili-
 ate with international bodies, and they do so without hindrance.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The right to organize and
 bargain collectively was established by statute in 1980. Trade union and collective
 bargaining rights were extended to all workers in the public sector, except the mili-
 tary services, in 1986. Public sector collective bargaining in 1990 was broadened to
 include salaries and employment levels, but the Government retained the right to
 fix salary and employment levels if negotiations did not achieve an agreement. Col-
 lective bargaining is widespread in both the private and public sectors. Private sec-
 tor collective bargaining agreements cover 60 percent of workers, although only a
 minority are actually union members. Though firm figures are not available, it is
 generally accepted that only about 10 percent of workers are dues-paying union
 members. Labor regulations and practices in free trade zones and export processing
 zones are the same as in the rest of the country. Union membership in these zones
 is reportedly higher than the average throughout the economy.
 The law prohibits discrimination by employers against union members and orga-
 nizers. Discrimination cases have priority in the labor courts. A prominent multi-
 national company was fined heavily in 1991 for discrimination against union orga-
 nizers. Legislation favored by the unions and adopted in 1990 has given trade
 unions a role in controlling work contracts to prevent abuse of contract and termi-
 nation actions.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced or compulsory labor is out-
 lawed and is not practiced. The legislation is effectively enforced.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-Thc legal minimum age for em-
 ployment as established by statute is 16 years. The Ministry of Labor and Social
 Security is primarily responsible for enforcement. The minimum age is effectively
 enforced in major industries and in the service sector. It is more difficult to control
 
 
 1067
 
 on small farms and in family-owned businesses. Legislation prohibiting child labor
 is effectively enforced in the special economic zones. The employment of persons
 under 18 years of age at night, for overtime work, or in sectors considered hazard-
 ous by the Ministry and the unions is also legally prohibited.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The legal minimum wage for workers over age
 18 is considered sufficient for a decent standard of living. The daily national mini-
 mum wage rate is approximately $15 (1,951 pesetas), effective January 1, 1993. The
 minimum wage for        a ae  6 and 17 is less; $9.91 (1,289 pesetas). The mini-
 mum wage is revised every year in accordance with the consumer price index and
 is effectively enforced by the Ministry of Labor and Social Security.A 40-hour work-
 week is established by law, with a minimum unbroken rest period of a day and a
 half following each 40 hours worked. Spanish workers enjoy 12 paid holidays a year
 and a month s paid vacation. Standards are effectively enforced.
 Government mechanisms exist for enforcing working conditions and occupational
 health and safety conditions, but bureaucratic procedures are cumbersome and inef-
 ficient. The National Institute of Safety and Health within the Ministry of Labor
 has technical responsibility for developing labor standards, but the Inspectorate of
 Labor has responsibility for enforcing the legislation through judicial action when
 infractions are found. Workers have legal protection for filing complaints about haz-
 ardous conditions.
