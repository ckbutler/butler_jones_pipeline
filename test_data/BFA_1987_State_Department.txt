 BURKINA FASO
 Burkina Faso, one of the world's poorer countries, is a victim
 of frequent drought and has been subject to political
 instability. From August 1983, Captain Thomas Sankara held
 power as President of Burkina Faso until he was replaced on
 October 15, 1987 by Captain Blaise Compaore, President of the
 Front Populaire, in the country's fourth military coup since
 1980. No political party activities have been permitted since
 1980, and there are no indications that the country will return
 to constitutional rule. Instead, the Government uses a network
 of Committees for the Defense of the Revolution (CDR),
 organized at national, regional, and local levels to mobilize
 the population and promote its revolutionary goals.
 The Burkina Faso armed forces number about 7,500 members,
 including 5,200 in the army, 100 in the air force, aid 2,200
 in the paramilitary gendarmerie and the police. It is not
 known if the security police (DST) still exist under the new
 regime. The CDRs also function as a people's militia and
 occasionally detain individuals without public charges or
 proceedings.
 Burkina Faso is overwhelmingly tied to subsistence agriculture,
 with 90 percent of the population living in rural areas. The
 economy is highly vulnerable to fluctuations in rainfall.
 Frequent drought, lack of communications and other
 infrastructure, a low literacy rate, and a stagnant economy
 are all longstanding problems.
 Human rights abuses continued in 1987. A key event before the
 coup was the detention of trade union personnel and related
 political figures beginning late in May, several of whom may
 have been tortured.' Trials of businessmen and civil servants,
 who were charged almost exclusively with fraud and corruption,
 continued to take place outside the traditional judicial
 system in People's Revolutionary Courts in which defendants
 may not be represented by legal counsel. Civilian and
 military personnel accused of lack of enthusiasm for the
 revolution continued to be dismissed for reasons ranging from
 misconduct to laziness, although in lesser numbers than in
 previous years. The October coup and its aftermath resulted
 in the loss of life from fighting and summary executions of
 about 30 persons, including former President Sankara. The new
 Government, however, released all political prisoners,
 reinstated previously suspended or dismissed government
 personnel, and allowed teachers who had been fired after a
 1984 strike to resume work.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 This year, apart from the military and civilian personnel
 killed during the coup itself, at least eight military and
 paramilitary personnel opposed to the new Government were
 summarily executed in the period immediately following that
 event. Prior to the coup, there were no known political
 killings during 1987. President Sankara is believed to have
 been killed in a gun fight during the coup.

 b. Disappearance
 There were no reports of politically motivated disappearance.
 c. Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 In 1987 there were allegations of torture of several trade
 union detainees. In its 1987 Report (covering 1986), Amnesty
 International stated that it had received reports about
 torture and ill-treatment of detainees held in connection with
 bomb explosions in 1985. Some prisoners were reported to have
 been tortured with electric shock, burnt with cigarettes,
 beatpn, and suspended by their wrists for long periods.
 Prison conditions are poor.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, Exile, or Forced Labor
 Reports of arbitrary arrest, followed at, times by incommunicado
 detention for days or months without charge, continued in
 1987. In some cases, though far fewer than in previous years,
 these appear to have been initiated by poorly trained CDR
 security personnel. The law permits preventive detention
 without charge for a maximum of 72 hours, renewable for a
 single 72-hour period in criminal cases. In practice, there
 are frequent violations of this restriction in cases involving
 both Burkinabe and foreign nationals, especially in political
 cases. In addition, in cases of emergency or national
 security, the military code overrides the civil code.
 Military code procedures provide for continued detention
 beyond'72 hours.
 Until the-October coup, several prominent political
 personalities of former regimes, such as the former President,
 Colohel Saye Zerbo,' remained:-under a loose form of house
 arrest. Others, such. as Paul Rouamba, former Ambassador to
 the United States and Ghana, remained imprisoned. Under
 SankarA, the Government began a series ,of arrests in 1987 of
 leadersof one.of the four major labor organizations, the
 Burkinabe Trade Union Confederation (CSB), starting with its
 Marxist Secretary General, Soumane Toure, on May 30.
 Subspquently, some 30 CSB members and political allies were
 detained without charge or trial for varying periods. Many
 were still in detention until the new Government freed all
 political prisoners. On July 2, the Secretary General of the
 essentially defunct School Teachers' Union, SNEAHV, Jean Bila,
 was- arrested and held without trial until the coup. The
 Government forced the CSB and its component unions to elect
 new leaders'in June. Nineteen members of a magistrates' union
 lost their jobs in mid-1987, reportedly due to their political
 views, but they were reinstated following the coup. The new
 Government detained or placed under house arrest several
 former officials from the Sankara regime. At the end of 1987,
 some were still being held.
 Some intellectuals, military officers, and former government
 officials have stayed in self-imposed exile, partly due to
 fear for their safety should they return. President Sankara
 had invited exiles to return home several times in recent
 years, asking them to participate in Burkina Faso's economic
 development. The new Government, like its predecessor, has
 welcomed opponents of the previous regime to return home.

 Forced or compulsory labor is prohibited by the labor code and
 is not known to be practiced.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 During 1987 the People's Revolutionary Courts continued to hear
 cases primarily involving public corruption. The president of
 each court is a magistrate appointed by the Government to head
 a tribunal composed of magistrates, military personnel, and
 members of the CDRs. The Court President asks questions
 directly of the defendant. There is no role for a public
 prosecutor, and the accused may consult but not be represented
 by counsel during the session. Witnesses can be called by the
 Court, or they can present themselves to give testimony. The
 Sankara Government preferred to use military courts, rather
 than the regular courts, to try persons charged with political
 and security offenses. The new Government did not try any
 political detainees during 1987.
 President Sankara said the people's courts should be viewed as
 a permanent part of the country's judicial system. The Sankara
 Government had already organized a series of similar tribunals
 to hear minor cases at the village, department, and province
 levels. Most of the judges in these lower level courts are
 popularly elected. The Government's oft-stated aim in
 establishing these peoples courts was to ensure fair access to
 justice for an overwhelmingly illiterate, impoverished
 population. One such court was convened to try corruption
 cases after the new Government took power.
 The regular judiciary, patterned after the French system, has
 continued to function for most criminal and civil cases.
 Defendants traditionally receive a fair trial and are
 represented by counsel. A new development in 1987 was the
 establishment of a system whereby civil service attorneys are
 appointed to represent those who do not wish to retain or are
 unable to afford, a private attorney. While these civil
 servants should theoretically make legal aid widely available
 and enjoy hypothetical independence of the Government, some
 observers believe this is the first step in gradual elimination
 of independent lawyers.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Government authorities generally do not interfere in the daily
 lives of ordinary citizens, and there is no general monitoring
 of private correspondence or telephones. In theory, homes may
 be searched only under authority of a warrant issued by the
 Attorney General. However, in national security-cases, a
 special law permits surveillance, searches, and monitoring of
 telephones and correspondence without a warrant. This law has
 been used against persons suspected of opposition to the
 Government.
 The Sankara Government encouraged participation in the CDR
 organization. Vigorous participation in CDR activities helped
 in obtaining civil service appointments and promotions. The
 Government considered opposition to CDR activities to be
 political opposition, which could lead in serious cases to
 discharge from the civil service. The attitude of the new
 Government toward citizen participation in the CDRs remained
 unclear at the end of 1987.

 BURKINA FASO
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 While-there is no formal government censorship, references by
 the regime to enemies of the State at home and abroad inhibit
 both government-employed journalists and ordinary citizens
 from expressing critical views. This is reinforced by
 occasional dismissals from government service and reports of
 arbitrary arrest, dampening a lively tradition of debate on
 political topics.
 Under the control of the Minister of Information, the media,
 which consist of a-daily and a weekly newspaper, a weekly
 magazine, .and radio and television stations, are government
 owned. There is no serious criticism of the Government as a
 whole in the media, but there is selected criticism of
 officials and programs, particularly in a new satirical
 government weekly newspaper.
 Foreign newspapers and magazines were permitted to enter the
 country freely during 1987, both before and after the coup.
 Foreign journalists could travel and file stories without
 censorship br hindrance and enjoyed easy access to government
 officials. The'-new Government allowed extensive and uncensored
 coverage of postcoup events by foreign journalists for about 2
 weeks. Then several journalists who-had been particularly
 aggressive in interviewing high school students about their
 reactions to the coup were detained briefly and released.
 Following the publication of similar stories by the magazine
 Jeune Afrique, the government radio station attacked the
 magazinbt-reporting.
 In the arts, movies are subject to bensorship by a review
 board which includes rel'igious authorities as well as
 government officials. Duting'1987 a wide variety of American,
 French, and other foreign films were shown. In 1987 there
 were no known instances of political censorship -of films.
 There is no interference with international radio broadcasts.
 b. Freedom of Peateful Assembly and Association
 Under both the Sankara and Compaore Governments, political
 partieb are banned, and administrative permission is generally
 required for assemblies of any kind. Nonpolitical associations
 for business, religious, cultural, sporting, and other purposes
 are allowed and experience no'difficulty in obtaining
 permission to meet.
 Organized labor continues to be an important force in
 Burkina. 'There are four 'labor federations--of which the
 largest is affiliated with the International Confederation of
 Free Trade Unions. There are also a number of autonomous
 unions. The federations take turns representing organized
 labor- a the International Labor Organization meetings and
 partici-pate in Afrtican regional labor meetings as well.
 Unions have-the right to bargain for-increased wages and other
 benefits within-a specific bargaining unit such as a company
 or factory but cannot bargain industry-wide. They represent
 the interests of their members in the private and public
 sectors, as well as before the labor inspection service of the
 Government and-before the courts. All unions jealously guard
 their limited independence from the Government. Organized
 labor has the formal right to strike, but the Sankara
 
 
 BURKINA FASO
 Government eliminated this right in practice. The attitude of
 the new military Government on the right to strike was not
 clear at the end of 1987.
 The Sankara Government made a major effort in 1987 to bring
 some elements of the labor movement in line with government
 policies, notably in the case of the CSB confederation (see
 Section l.d.).
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Burkina Faso is a secular state, and there is no discrimination
 on religious grounds. Islam and Christianity exist side by
 side, with almost 40 percent of the population Muslim and
 about 10 percent Christian. The remainder of the population
 practices traditional African religions. Both Muslim and
 Christian holidays are recognized as national holidays.
 Social mobility and access to modern sector jobs are neither
 linked to, nor restricted by, religious affiliations.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Travelers within Burkina Faso are often stopped at police,
 army, and internal customs checkpoints. There appears to be
 little restriction on foreign travel for business and
 tourism. Exit permits, once used to limit movements of
 workers to neighboring countries, particularly to the Cote
 d'Ivoire where 1 million or more Burkinabe continue to reside
 and work, are no longer required.
 Refugees are accepted freely in Burkina Faso, and attempts are
 made to provide for their care in cooperation with the United
 Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.. There were
 approximately 250 refugees and displaced persons in Burkina
 Faso at the end of 1987, mainly from Chad.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights:, The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their. Government
 Neither under the last Chief of State, President Sankara, nor
 under the rule of the President of the Front Populaire,
 Captain Blaise Compaore, have the citizens had the right to
 change their government. Despite four changes in leadership
 since 1980, the military has dominated the political process.
 Captain Compaore told a journalist late in October that his
 ambition is to limit, then to disengage, the army from playing
 a role in politics. He pledged to move toward
 "democratization" of the country.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government has made no attempt to hinder the activities of
 international human rights organizations. In March 1986, the
 Sankara Government invited Amnesty International to send a
 delegate to observe the trial of an official charged with
 embezzlement of funds. (The organization declined on the
 grounds that the case appeared to be solely a criminal matter,
 and thus was outside its mandate.) The new Government's
 attitude toward the European Parliament's November resolution
 condemning the assassination of Sankara was unknown.

 BURKINA FASO
 A government-supported organization lobbies against the South
 African apartheid system and other racial oppression, but it
 makes no effort to. look into domestic human rights issues or
 foreign practices other than racial discrimination.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language or Social Status
 Minority ethnic groups are as likely to be represented in the
 inner ciroles of-the-Government as'are the dominant Mossi, who
 coinprise-:50 percent of the population. Government decisions
 do not favor one ethnic group over another. One ostensible
 reason for the 1983 increase in administrative regions from 11
 to 30 was to improve access of minority groups to local
 administrative authorities.
 The role, of womenlin Burkina FaSo-is still limited by the
 cultural orientation-of a rural African society. Women are
 important in family farming and in-the market economy. The
 Sankara Government emphasized its strong commitment to
 expanding-opportunities for women and appointed a number of
 women-to cabinet positions and bther government jobs. The new
 Governnpnt has not taken formal positions on the status of
 women, but 3owomen remain in the Cabinet.
 CONDITIONS OF LABOR-
 The labor code sets the minimum age for employment at 14, the
 average age for completion of basic secondary school.
 However  the Government lacks the means to enforce this
 provisioi.,adequately,.owing to the large number of small,'
 family subsistence farms, and the traditional apprenticeship
 system. A minimum monthly wage of about $75 and a maximum
 workweek of 48 hours are stipulated by the labor code, as are
 safety and health provisions. A system of government
 inspections and labor courts ensures that -these provisions are
 applied in the small industrial and commercial sectors, but
 they have b.een impossible to- efforce in the dominant
 subsistence agriculture sector.   - "
