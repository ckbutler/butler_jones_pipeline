 DOMINICA
 Independent since 1978 and a member of the British
 Commonwealth, Dominica has a system of parliamentary dbmocracy
 dating back to British colonial rule. Prime Minister Eugenia
 Charles and the governing Dominica Freedom Party (DFP) won the
 July 1980 general elections and were reelected to a second
 term in July 1985. Both elections were free, fair, and open,
 and voter participation was heavy. The opposition Democratic
 Labor Party (DLP) formed a coalition with a number of smaller
 opposition groups before the 1985 elections and won 43 percent
 ,of the popular vote. A third party, the Dominica United
 Workers Party (DUWP), was formed in 1988.
 Since the defense force was disbanded in 1981 following two
 violent coup attempts, the police have been the only security
 force in Dominica. A small Special Service Unit (SSU) has
 been organized within the police force as part of the Regional
 Security System of the Eastern Caribbean States. The SSU has
 been provided some light infantry training, and a marine wing
 has been organized within the police force to function as a
 coast guard. Both the SSU and the marine wing are supervised
 by the Commissioner of Police.
 Dominica's mountainous terrain and periodic devastation by
 hurricanes have caused it to remain one of the least developed
 nations in the Eastern Caribbean. In 1988 Dominica completed
 the second year of a structural adjustment program sponsored
 by the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, and the
 country's economic growth rate has improved significantly.
 The primarily agrarian economy is prospering due to continued
 high earnings from banana exports to the United Kingdom under
 a generous quota. Consequently, government attempts to
 encourage crop diversification have not been successful.
 Several small industrial plants are operating, but
 unemployment remains Dominica's main social problem.
 Dominica's human rights record remained good during 1988.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There were no reports of politically motivated killings.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reports of disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 The Constitution prohibits torture or other forms of cruel,
 inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, and there were
 no reports of such practices.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The Constitution prohibits arbitrary arrest, detention, or
 exile. The right to a judicial determination of the legality
 of the detention is respected. Dominican law requires that
 persons arrested or detained be charged with a crime within 24

 DOMINICA
 hours or be released trom custody and this is honored in
 practice. There were no reports of arbitrary arrest or exile
 in 1988. With regard to forced or compulsory labor, see
 Section 6.c.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The Constitution provides for public trial before an
 independent, impartial court. Criminal defendants are
 presumed innocent until proven guilty, are allowed legal
 counsel, and have the right of appeal on legal or procedural
 matters. However, indigent criminal defendants are provided
 legal counsel only in capital cases.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Constitution prohibits arbitrary entry, search, and
 seizure. Search warrants are required by law. There were no
 reports in 1988 of arbitrary government intrusions into the
 private lives of individuals.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution provides for the right of free expression,
 which is affirmed in practice. The political opposition
 freely criticizes the Government. Dominica's main radio
 station is state owned, and the other two stations confine
 their broadcasts to religious programming. However,
 Dominicans enjoy good access to independent news sources
 through cable television and radio reception from neighboring
 islands. The sole weekly newspaper was founded and is
 supported by the Catholic Church. Its editorial stance is
 generally pro-Government, but opposition viewpoints are
 prominently reported. In 1985 the Government discontinued
 live radio broadcasts of Parliamentary sessions, a reflection
 of official displeasure over the opposition's use of the-
 airwaves as a dramatic stage from which to promote its
 causes. The DLP responded by refusing to engage in
 parliamentary debate for 18 months. The broadcast ban
 remained in place throughout 1988.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Freedoms of association and assembly are honored without
 exception. Opposition groups hold-rallies, meetings, and
 conventions without hindrance from the Government. For a
 discussion of freedom of association as it applies to labor
 unions, see Section 6.a.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 The population is 80 percent Roman Catholic, and the remainder
 is largely Protestant, with a small Muslim community and some
 Rastafarians. The free practice of religion is allowed, and
 religious groups from the United States and-other countries
 regularly visit Dominica to promote their faiths.-
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 These rights are provided for by law and honored in practice.
 Passports are state property and may be withdrawn if

 subversion is suspected. The Government has on occasion
 prevented travel to Libya by means of passport revocation.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Dominica has a parliamentary system of government in which
 citizens have clear political choices and opportunities
 through free elections to change their government. In 1980
 the DFP gained power for the first time and was subsequently
 reelected in 1985. Both elections were universally
 acknowledged to be fair. The DFP now holds 17 seats in
 Parliament and the DLP 4.. Together, they represent a broad
 political spectrum. Elections are required at least every 5
 years, with the next election due in 1990. The newly formed
 third party, the DUWP, will provide the voters a further
 choice when elections next occur. Women play a significant
 role-in political life; the Prime Minister and the mayor of
 thie capital city, Roseau, are female.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 No international human rights organization has a branch office
 in Dominica. The Human Rights Committee of the Dominica
 National Workers Union has occasionaily published allegations
 of human rights violations in Dominica in the past. The Union
 is not affiliated with any recognized labor organization.
 There were no formal human rights complaints during 1988.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 The Constitution provides for equal rights under the law
 iegardless of race or sex. There is no legal restriction on
 the role of women in the nation's public or social life. Once
 largely limited to the home and to agricultural work, the rle
 of women has changed dramatically as women they assumed
 increasing responsibilities in public and private
 enterprises. Women now constitute at least half the paid
 labor force and figure prominently in such traditional male
 occupations as banking and government service. Although most
 business leaders are men, the outgoing 1988 Chamber of
 Commerce president was a woman. The 1977 Labor Standards Act
 specifies equal pay for equal work and is observed in
 practice.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Labor has the right to organize, choose representatives,
 bargain, and to strike. Workers are organized in both the
 public and private sectors and in agricultural and industrial
 activities. The right to strike is respected in practice. In
 1988 agricultural workers went on strike at a coconut
 plantation and won their demand for back pay. A strike was
 also threatened at a foreign-owned garment plant. With the
 exception of the Civil Service Association, labor unions have
 small memberships and are not a significant political force.
 In 1988 the Government introduced legislation to regulate
 civil servants' wages and thereby restrict collective
 bargaining in the public sector.

 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 Union rights are protected by law and enforced by judicial and
 police authority. Workers have the right to bargain
 collectively in negotiating the settlement of disputes with
 employers, and the Government promotes mechanisms for
 voluntary negotiations between employers and workers and their
 organizations. There are no sectors or areas, including
 export processing zones, where union organization apd
 collective bargaining are legally or admiistratively.
 discouraged or impeded. Union officials and members are
 protected by law against antiunion discrimination. Unions are
 free to organize workers without Government or employer
 interference. In 1988 a Korean firm opened a garment factory
 in Dominica and workers were able to organize freely. The
 workers subsequently presented an eight-point proposal to the
 firm and were supported by the Dock Workers Union, which
 refused to load Korean products until bargaining ensued.
 Collective bargaining is fairly widespread in the
 nonagricultural sector. Enforcement mechanisms are the
 responsibility of the Department of Labor, whose inspectors
 carry out investigations under the supervision of the
 Commissioner of Labor. Dominica is a member of the
 International Labor Organization.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 There is no forced or compulsory labor in Dominica.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 The minimum working age is 14 and is generally observed in
 practice.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 The standard workweek is 40 hours in 5 days. Workers are
 entitled to minimum of 2 weeks' annual vacation. The only
 minimum wage is that for agricultural workers at $3.80 per
 day, which is barely sufficient to support the worker. The
 Employment Safety Act, an Occupational Health and Safety Law
 consonant with international standards, was passed in 1984.
 Occupational health and safety standards are carried out under
 this law. Firms are notified of deficiencies and given 3 to 6
 months to come into compliance. Inspections are continual,
 but to date there are no cases of prosecutions or fines under
 the Act.
