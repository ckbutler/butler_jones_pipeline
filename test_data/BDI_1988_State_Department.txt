 BURUNDI
 The Republic of Burundi is a one-party state led by President
 Pierre Buyoya, an army major who came to power in a bloodless
 coup in September 1987. The 30-member Military Committee for
 National Salvation rules the nation, exercising legislative
 and regulatory powers while the Constitution is officially
 suspended. The 23-member Cabinet, appointed by the Military
 Committee and composed of 20 civilians and 3 military
 officers, formulates and proposes policies and manages the
 day-to-day business of government. As President, head of the
 Military Committee, and Minister of Defense, Buyoya plays the
 major policymaking role. The National Party for Unity and
 Progress (UPRONA) is the only political party. The dominance
 of the minority Tutsi over the majority Hutu ethnic group has
 been the central social and political reality of Burundi for
 several centuries. After assuming power last year, Buyoya
 announced a policy of tribal reconciliation and promised to
 increase Hutu participation in the country's emerging
 political institutions. Slow but steady progress towards that
 end was interrupted temporarily by a serious outbreak of
 ethnic violence in the north of Burundi in mid-August.
 The Burundi Armed Forces, while small in number, are well
 equipped and well trained to maintain law and order. In
 addition, there is a regular police force responsible for
 public order and a separate force of security police
 responsible primarily for internal state security, including
 the monitoring of dissent. The State Security Police have the
 same powers of arrest as the regular police and are subject to
 the same process of judicial review.
 Burundi is a poor country with one of the highest population
 densities in Africa. The AIDS epidemic has made serious
 inroads into the Burundi population and is expected to
 adversely affect economic activity in coming years. Most
 Burundi (90 percent) earn their livelihood as subsistence
 farmers working small, privately owned plots. The small
 monetary economy is based on coffee, which accounts for nearly
 90 percent of foreign exchange earnings. Burundi, with a
 population of 5 million, is one of the highest per capita
 recipients of foreign assistance in Africa.
 Throughout 1988 the Buyoya regime continued its policy of
 correcting the human rights abuses of the former Bagaza
 Government, particularly as regards religious persecution. An
 anticorruption campaign began in earnest in early summer, with
 a number of high officials losing their jobs. The major
 development in 1988 was the outbreak of ethnic violence
 between Hutus and Tutsis in mid-August--the first serious
 ethnic strife since 1972. Details regarding the extent and
 nature of the violence are still sketchy, but it appears that
 at least 5,000 people lost their lives in northern Burundi
 after Hutu peasants began killing local Tutsi inhabitants and
 the military interceded forcefully to restore order, killing
 several thousand Hutus. Approximately 48,000 Burundi refugees
 fled to southern Rwanda in the wake of the violence. The
 killings were limited to the two northern provinces where the
 initial massacres took place, and no massive reprisals
 occurred in the weeks following the violence. Afterwards,
 President Buyoya pledged to accelerate his policies of tribal
 reconciliation and established the Commission on National
 Unity, an ethnically balanced body of "wise men" who will
 study the ethnic problem and make recommendations. In October
 he reorganized the Cabinet to give Hutus 12 of the 24
 
 
 34
 BURUNDI
 portfolios, including that of Prime Minister. By the end of
 the year all but a few thousand refugees had returned to
 Burundi voluntarily.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 In mid-August 1988, bands of Hutu peasants attacked and killed
 numerous Tutsi families in the northern communes of Ntega and
 Marangara. Unofficial initial estimates of the dead ranged
 from several hundred to 5,000. Despite government charges
 that the violence was incited by activist Hutu refugees who
 oppose the regime, no firm evidence exists that it was
 politically inspired. These initial killings were followed by
 the intervention of the Tutsi-dominated army to restore
 order. During its intervention, the army engaged in reprisal
 killings of unarmed civilians. The Government acknowledged
 that innocent civilians were among the victims of army actions
 to restore order, but it denied vengeance killings took
 place. The Government has taken no public action to punish
 those soldiers who engaged in reprisals against innocent
 civilians. The Government's estimate of the total number of
 deaths resulting from the violence is 5,000--of which it
 claims unofficially about 3,000 were Tutsi killed in the
 initial violence and 2,000 were Hutus killed in clashes with
 the army. Unofficial estimates are much higher in regard to
 Hutu deaths. Press reports speculated that as many as 24,000
 Hutus may have been killed, but more credible estimates are of
 5,000 to 10,000 dead, Hutu and Tutsi combined. There were
 unsubstantiated allegations that, following the mass violence,
 the army targeted individual, educated Hutus for killing.
 While there may never be an accurate accounting of the
 casualties, it is possible that planned censuses of the
 affected areas, conducted by the Government with the
 assistance of international organizations, may make more
 accurate estimates possible.
 b. Disappearance
 There are a small number of unresolved cases of disappearance
 connected with the ethnic violence in the north. It remains
 to be determined whether the people in question took refuge
 elsewhere, are in hiding, are in official custody, or were
 killed.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Torture is forbidden by law, but cruel treatment of suspects
 or detainees has occurred in the form of beatings at the time
 of arrest or interrogation. These beatings, when combined
 with other harsh conditions, have led upon occasion to serious
 injury or even death. One detainee reportedly died in early
 September due to beating during questioning, and the public
 prosecutor responsible for the case was relieved of his duties.
 Since coming to power, the Buyoya regime has allowed regular
 inspection of prison conditions by the International Committee
 of the Red Cross (ICRC). Although the Government assured the
 ICRC in September of continued access to prisoners, it
 restricted access to the detainees suspected of involvement in
 
 
 35
 BURUNDI
 the ethnic massacres until early December, when a full
 schedule of visits resumed. Prison conditions remain harsh
 due to lack of adequate hygiene, medical care, and food. The
 Government recognizes the severity of this problem and has
 begun a program of prison renovation.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Police officers are empowered to detain suspects without an
 arrest warrant, but must submit a written report to the public
 prosecutor's office within 24 hours. The public prosecutor
 examines the report and can either order the release of the
 detainee or issue an arrest warrant valid for 5 days. The
 public prosecutor then must state the charges before a
 magistrate in the presence of the detainee. The magistrate
 either releases the detainee or issues orders confirming the
 detention, initially for 5 days and subsequently for 30-day
 periods as necessary to prepare the case for trial. Bail is
 set only in cases of embezzlement or similar crimes involving
 financial wrongdoing. In general, the prescribed procedures
 for arrest and imprisonment are followed. However, time
 limits for issuance of arrest warrants and appearance before a
 magistrate are often exceeded, usually due to a shortage of
 magistrates and prosecutors. The Government has begun to
 address this problem by increasing the number of magistrates.
 The total number of detentions connected with the ethnic
 violence in the north is unknown, although one credible
 estimate of detainees is 50 persons. Six signatories of an
 open letter criticizing the army's role in the ethnic
 massacres were still in detention at the end of 1988 and have
 not yet been charged with crimes. Several Hutu educators and
 civil servants in northern Burundi were detained in September
 under suspicion of having planned or been otherwise involved
 in the violence. Many are still in detention, but none has as
 yet been charged with any crimes.
 The Government does not exile its nationals as a means of
 political control. Since his ouster, ex-President Bagaza has
 been denied permission to return to Burundi. However, the
 Buyoya Government has stated he may return to Burundi if he
 negotiates the conditions with the present regime. Citizens
 of other countries suspected of criminal activity or lacking
 proper residency documents are often expelled.
 With regard to forced or compulsory labor, see section 6.c.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The judiciary's independence is limited by the requirement to
 adhere to the guidance and recommendations of the party, the
 Government, and the President. Judges are appointed by and
 serve at the pleasure of the President. Though court
 decisions cannot be overturned by the executive branch, the
 President has the power to pardon or reduce sentences. In
 cases of political interest, the Government has occasionally
 interfered with the judiciary. In July, following the
 judiciary's acquittal of a former government minister of
 corruption charges, the President dismissed the President of
 the Supreme Court. This judge was accused of having taken
 bribes to acquit the former minister, but no proof of the
 alleged bribe has been made public. The Government also
 subsequently replaced judicial (and law enforcement) personnel
 at every level--Supreme Court, Courts of Appeal, Superior
 
 
 BURUNDI
 Courts, magistrates, prosecutors, and investigators--in six
 different provinces.
 Burundi has separate court systems to deal with military,
 civil/criminal, and state security cases. Military tribunals
 have jurisdiction only over military personnel. The State
 Security Court has jurisdiction over both civilian and
 military personnel, and its proceedings need not be made
 public. To date, this Court has been used only once, in
 prosecuting ex-President Micombero in the mid-1970's. Burundi
 law provides the right to counsel, and indigents are provided
 defense counsel by the State. Pretrial proceedings may
 involve lengthy investigations. The courts are hampered by a
 lack of trained legal personnel and by heavy case loads.
 Following the September 1987 coup d'etat, the Buyoya
 Government released all political prisoners or detainees in
 Burundi. Six former officials of the Bagaza regime are in
 prison, charged with criminal, not political, offenses
 (primarily corruption). One former minister was convicted of
 fraud in October 1988 and sentenced to 8 years in prison, but
 none of the others have yet been brought to trial.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The inviolability of private correspondence and of the home
 are enshrined in the (suspended) Constitution and are
 respected in practice. A judicial warrant is required for a
 law enforcement official to enter and search a private
 residence, and this requirement is respected in practice.
 Membership in the political party (UPRONA) and its affiliated
 organizations is open to all but is not required. The State
 Security Office monitors political dissent through the State
 Security Police and by employing informers who report on
 discontent and dissent as well as on criminal activity.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 These freedoms are significantly restricted. Since the
 beginning of the Buyoya regime, there has been an
 unprecedented public debate on formerly taboo subjects, such
 as ethnic relations and official corruption. The debate has
 been especially spirited in UPRONA party meetings, which is
 the form of dialog officially encouraged by government
 authorities. The Government's tolerance for public criticism
 outside party forums is limited, however. Many of the
 signatories of an open letter critical of the Army's role in
 the ethnic killings either lost their jobs, were suspended
 from studies, or were detained.
 The Government controls all domestic print and broadcast
 media. The French-language daily and Kirundi-language weekly
 papers are published by the Ministry of Information, which
 also operates the domestic radio and television stations. The
 media are traditionally required to support the fundamental
 policies of the party and the Government. Some criticism of
 the Government is permitted in the printed press, but
 journalists are state employees and subject to disciplinary
 action if their criticism goes beyond what is considered
 tolerable. The Government rarely interferes with the
 distribution of foreign news publications and never interferes
 with radio reception fiom foreign sources. Public censorship
 
 
 BURUNDI
 occurs only in the case of sexually explicit foreign film
 material or publications.
 Academic freedom has been limited in the past in that primary
 and secondary school teachers were expected to support
 government policies. At the university, professors come from
 many different countries, both East and West, and are
 permitted to lecture freely in their subject areas, conduct
 research, and draw independent conclusions. They are expected
 to and do refrain from commenting publicly on domestic
 political issues.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 In the aftermath of the August 1988 ethnic massacres, the
 Government prohibited all public meetings of more than five
 persons without specific authorization. The Government
 announced this as a temporary measure and lifted it on October
 31 along with a curfew and other temporary security
 restrictions. As far as is known, the Government has never
 refused to grant authorization when requested. The Government
 permits nonpolitical private associations but requires that
 they be registered and accorded legal recognition before they
 may function. No political associations other than the ruling
 party are permitted. Several persons who tried to revive a
 banned second party, PALIPEHUTU (Liberation Party for the Hutu
 People), were briefly jailed in March 1988.
 For a discussion of freedom of association as it applies to
 labor unions, see Section 6.a.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 During his first year in office, President Buyoya made
 sweeping changes in Burundi's policies toward organized
 religion, reversing the repression of religious expression
 under the Bagaza regime. Buyoya freed all religious
 prisoners; reopened the closed churches; returned all
 confiscated church properties, including houses and schools;
 authorized weekday masses; reinstituted the activities of
 catechists; and authorized church schools (including
 seminaries and literacy/catechism classes), publications, and
 radio broadcasts. The Government is negotiating with the
 churches regarding compensation for property seized by the
 former regime. Some of the missionaries who were expelled
 under Bagaza are being allowed to return, and there are no
 restrictions on new missionaries. Organized religion, in
 particular the Catholic Church, plays a key role in the
 development of the country and the lives of both rural and
 urban Burundi.
 Religious expression continues to be regulated by civil laws
 and regulations. Religious organizations are subject to the
 same rules and restrictions which apply to secular
 organizations. All religious associations must receive
 approval from the Government to operate in Burundi, and a
 Burundi citizen must be appointed as legal representative of
 each association. Religious groups may not engage in
 political activity critical of the Government. During the
 Bagaza regime, two religious denominations were banned: the
 Seventh Day Adventists and the Jehovah's Witnesses. The
 Buyoya regime has legally recognized the Adventist Church and
 returned all of its confiscated properties. The Government
 has received a delegation of the Jehovah's Witnesses, and
 their legal recognition is presently under consideration.
 
 
 BURUNDI
 There are no barriers to the maintenance of links with
 coreligionists in other countries. Participation in religious
 groups does not exclude people from membership in the UPRONA
 party or from receiving social benefits.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 The Government instituted restrictions on internal travel in
 August 1988 following ethnic violence in the north. Any
 person traveling between communes needed specific permission
 to do so in the form of a laissez-passer issued by the
 communal administrator, which was issued routinely. An 11
 p.m. to 5 a.m. curfew was in effect throughout Burundi. The
 Government lifted these travel restrictions on October 31.
 Some 48,000 Burundi citizens fled to Rwanda following the
 recent ethnic violence in northern Burundi. The Government
 collaborated with the Government of Rwanda, the International
 Committee of the Red Cross, and the United Nations High
 Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) to create a climate of
 confidence in the north to encourage the refugees to return.
 This effort has been sucessful, and most of the refugees have
 voluntarily returned to their home areas.
 The Government continues to discourage migration to urban
 areas through an active public education campaign. Foreign
 travel and emigration are relatively free, though travelers
 must explain the reason for their trip and must surrender
 their passports to the immigration office on their return to
 Burundi. Prospective Burundi travelers must have exit visas
 as well as passports. In the past, many foreigners applying
 for exit visas were required to prove they had no outstanding
 debts.
 In the past, repatriated Burundi refugees were welcomed and
 accorded full rights as citizens. Burundi claims to host some
 262,000 refugees, most of whom are Rwandan Tutsis who have
 resided in Burundi since the 1960's. The Government
 collaborates closely with the UNHCR in refugee matters. The
 Government does not engage in forced repatriation of refugees,
 but it has periodically deported Zairians and Rwandans who
 lacked residence permits or who had been arrested on suspicion
 of criminal activities.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 The military rules in Burundi, and citizens do not have the
 right to change their government through democratic
 procedures. Since September 1987, the 30-member Military
 Committee for National Salvation (CMSN), headed by President
 Pierre Buyoya, has been the supreme body, taking
 responsibility for policymaking and direction of government.
 Most executive decisions are taken by the 10-member Executive
 Committee of the CMSN, also headed by Buyoya. The President
 has indicated that the Military Committee will rule until
 civilian government institutions, presumably including the
 National Assembly, are reconstituted. When he was sworn in,
 President Buyoya promised a new constitution and a return to
 civilian rule within 2 years, but there has been little
 movement toward these goals.
 Political participation can take place only within the
 one-party structure, and voters can express dissatisfaction
 
 
 BURUNDI
 only by voting against incumbents for party positions. The
 party is open to all Burundi citizens supporting its
 principles, and both men and women are active members and
 office holders. The UPRONA party, together with its youth,
 women's, and labor-affiliated movements, claims a membership
 of approximately 1.4 million persons, over three-quarters of
 the adult population. The party regularly holds local and
 regional meetings, where party members discuss issues and make
 recommendations. During the past year, participation in party
 elections has expanded. Formerly, the slate of candidates for
 local and national party offices was selected by central
 government cadres and voted upon by party membership. Any
 party member now wishing to run for office can have his or her
 name on the ballot without advance central party approval.
 Allegations that Hutu were discriminated against in this
 process in northern Burundi are thought to have contributed to
 the unrest prior to the outbreak of violence. Voting is
 secret in localities where members are literate, but in some
 rural areas where members are illiterate, voting is by a show
 of hands.
 Women are represented at all levels in the political life of
 the country, including many in the UPRONA party and two in
 Buyoya's Cabinet. Their main vehicle of political expression
 is the Burundi Women's Union, which is affiliated with the
 party.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Buyoya Government initially rejected calls for an
 international inquiry into the August 1988 ethnic violence in
 the north on grounds of national sovereignty. However, in
 October the Government informed the United Nations Secretary
 General that it would be willing to receive a U.N.
 fact-finding mission to examine ethnic tensions and the
 refugee problem. It already has permitted outside observers,
 including the ICRC, journalists, diplomats, historians,
 representatives of the U.N. and the Organization of African
 Unity (OAU), and officials of private voluntary organizations
 to visit the affected areas extensively. The Government is
 undertaking its own investigation of the events and has
 reiterated that any outside observers are welcome to visit the
 area to take stock of the situation. The Buyoya Government
 restricted ICRC access to some detainees in the wake of the
 ethnic violence, but by the end of the year was again allowing
 the ICRC to visit all prisons and other detention facilities.
 Burundi is a party to several United Nations instruments on
 human rights, but it has not signed the OAU African Charter on
 Human and Peoples' Rights.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 The minority Tutsi have for many centuries dominated the
 majority Hutu people. Civil strife has erupted between the
 two groups several times, most recently in April 1972 and
 August 1988. In both instances, a Hutu uprising resulting in
 numerous deaths of Tutsi was followed by military intervention
 that resulted in massive Hutu killings. In both cases, the
 violence was followed by thousands of Hutu refugees fleeing
 Burundi. At the outset of its gaining power in September
 1987, the Government of President Pierre Buyoya adopted an
 official policy of ethnic reconciliation. Buyoya named Hutus
 
 
 BURUNDI
 to all levels of government, including 7 to his 23-member
 Cabinet, and 6 of 15 provincial governors. The changes in
 nomination procedures for UPRONA party elections also resulted
 in many more Hutus holding party offices. In the aftermath of
 the recent violence, President Buyoya, having pledged to
 create greater opportunities for Hutus, in October gave an
 equal number of ministerial portfolios to Hutus in his Cabinet
 and appointed a Hutu as Prime Minister.
 Despite these encouraging beginnings, de facto discrimination
 by Tutsi against Hutu is found in many areas of society,
 though it is not condoned by law. There are few Hutus in the
 Army, and the majority of civil service jobs, as well as
 university and secondary school places, go to Tutsis. Tutsi
 also dominate the modern economic sector, though in rural
 areas economic opportunities are roughly equivalent for both
 ethnic groups.
 Women hold a secondary position in Burundi society, although
 their status is changing from traditional patterns. The
 suspended Constitution provides for legal equality. The
 current legal code prohibits polygamy and a dowry requirement,
 allows women some control over family matters, and provides
 for land inheritance by women. Although fewer women than men
 obtain a formal education, once a degree is attained women
 generally can find suitable employment. The Government has
 not discriminated against women in hiring.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Burundi workers do not have the right of association as
 defined by the International Labor Organization (ILO). The
 UPRONA party controls the national Trade Union Confederation
 (UTB) and has institutionalized this single trade union
 structure by means of legislation. No other unions are
 allowed by law. The present head of the UTB was named by
 President Buyoya, but all other officeholders were elected by
 the UTB membership. The principal role of the UTB, to which
 virtually the entire salaried work force belongs, is to serve
 as an intermediary between workers and employers in labor
 matters. The UTB formulates its programs and policies in
 concert with the Ministry of Labor. Unauthorized advocacy of
 a strike or lockout is a criminal offense. Therefore,
 although they are theoretically permitted, there have been no
 strikes in recent years. The UTB participates in the ILO and
 is a member of the Organization of African Trade Union Unity.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 Workers do not have the right to organize outside the UTB.
 Within the UTB, they have the right to bargain individually
 and collectively in labor disputes, and in practice UTB has
 often forced employers to revise their practices. Due to the
 almost universal membership in UTB among salaried employees,
 antiunion discrimination is not a problem in practice. There
 are no export processing zones in Burundi, and labor laws are
 applied uniformly throughout the country.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 While forced or compulsory labor is not permitted under
 Burundi law, the ILO Committee of Experts has noted that
 provisions of ordinances concerning the conservation and
 
 
 41
 BURUNDI
 utilization of soils and the creation and maintenance of
 minimum areas of food crops are in violation of ILO Convention
 No. 29. It has urged the Government to bring the texts into
 conformity with the Convention and into line with what the
 Government asserts is actual practice. The Committee also
 noted that the various legislative provisions, which call for
 imprisonment (involving obligation to work) for expressions of
 political views contrary to those of the party, are not in
 compliance with ILO Convention 105. The Government in this
 instance has indicated that it intends to examine the
 possibility of revising the prison legislation.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 Children under the age of 12 may not be legally employed in
 any capacity, nor may children under the age of 16 be engaged
 in dangerous or strenuous work. As a practical matter in this
 poor, largely rural country, many children are obliged by
 custom and circumstance to help their families in subsistence
 agriculture.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 Over 90 percent of the population of Burundi is engaged in
 subsistence agriculture. Worker rights are guaranteed by the
 Burundi labor code and by the UTB, but these rights have
 relevance primarily for workers in the small, wage sector of
 the economy. The established minimum wage is $1.03 per day in
 Bujumbura, and $0.90 per day in rural areas; this wage level
 is inadequate to provide a decent living for urban families,
 who frequently supplement their income through family
 gardening or small businesses. Wages are higher in the few
 private sector businesses and for skilled jobs. Working hours
 vary between 40 and 45 hours per week. Saturday afternoons,
 Sundays, and holidays are times of rest. In the modern
 economic sector, minimum health and safety standards are
 monitored by the Ministry of Labor. The enforcement of these
 standards is limited, due to lack of resources.
