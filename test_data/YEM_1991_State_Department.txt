 The Republic of Yemen was proclaimed on May 22, 1990, by the
 political leadership of the Yemen Arab Republic (YAR) and the
 People's Democratic Republic of Yemen (PDRY). The two
 legislatures had ratified an interim unity Constitution, which
 was overwhelmingly approved in a popular referendum in May
 1991. Under this Constitution, the primary ruling bodies are
 the five-member Presidential Council, whose President is the
 Head of State, the C6uncil of Ministers, the Consultative
 Assembly, and the Parliament. The Parliament will remain in
 session for a 30-month transitional period scheduled to end in
 November .1992 when multiparty parliamentary elections are to be
 held. The new Parliament will have the power to draft a new,
 permanent constitution. The transitional agreement provides
 that the laws of the two former Yemen republics will remain in
 effect until supplanted by new laws passed by the Yemeni
 Parliament. .Leaders of the former YAR and PDRY dominate the
 Republic's -Government. The central Government.in Sanaa
 exercises its authority over much of Yemen, but tribal leaders
 in the north and east continue to.hold considerable power based
 on their traditional prerogatives.
 The two states' security services were technically abolished
 just before unification. A combined security service continues
 to exist as part of the Ministry of.Interior. Its.officers
 have broad discretion over perceived national security issues,
 and despite constitutional prohibitions-frequently mistreat
 detainees, routinely detain citizens for questioning, monitor
 personal activities, telephone conversations, and
 correspondence, and search homes.
 Yemen is a poor country of 12 million people with a rudinmentary
 -physical and social infrastructure. After unification, the
 Marxist economy in the south was liberalized along the lines of
 the free market economhy in the north, but significant former
 PDRY state institutions remain in the-south  Agriculture and
 oil dominate the Yemeni economy, with modest oil exports
 providing a large percentage of governmeit revenues.
 Remittancos from Yemeni workers in. Saudi'Arabia'and the Gulf
 states, a former principal'source of hard currency income, have
 declined dramatically, in the aftermath of the Persian Gulf War
 and the large-scale departure of Yemeni workers from the Gulf
 area.                               "
 Major .human rights problems include abuse of. prisoners and
 detainees and arbitrary detention. Civil liberties, including
 freedom of speech and association and.guarantees'-against
 discriminition'based'on sex, racial origin,.or religion,- .
 - remained significantly restricted. However, althbugh not
 .entirely free from gfovernment qensorship, the press enjoys
 increasing freedom, and the atmosphere for political party
 activity continues to'improve: There are now approximately 90
 registered periodicals in Yemen and 38 political parties.
 Informal and-.some institutionalized discrimination, exists
 against Yemeni citizens with a non-Yemeni parent. Tribal and
 traditional-social customs continue to restrict women's public
 role in society.

 YEMEN
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Ingegrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 There were no confirmed reports of such killings, although
 prominent, politically active persons have been assassinated,
 one as recently as December. There is no conclusive evidence
 about the identity of those responsible.
 b. Disappearance
 There were occasional reports of lemenis disappearing following
 detention by the security forces. Most such detainees were
 eventually released. The fate of 16 political detainees who
 disappeared in the former PDRY between 1967 and 1975 remains
 unknown. Human rights observers also continue to express
 concern about the fate of 25 members of the former National
 Democratic Front, arrested between 1984 and 1988, and a number
 of others who "disappeared" between 1967 and 1986. The
 Government denies having any information about 12 persons
 arrested in the former YAR for political reasons in 1989.
 c. Torture ana Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 The Constitution proscribes "physical punishment and degrading
 treatment," and there were no reports of torture in 1991, in
 contrast to previous years. However, security officials are
 commonly believed to resort with impunity to force or the
 threat of force to extract information from detainees. The YAR
 legal code is based on Islamic Shari'a law, which allows for
 such punishments as stoning for adultery, amputation for
 stealing, and beheading for murder. In August government
 officials beheaded five persons convicted of murder and
 amputated the hands of four others and the hand and foot of one
 other person convicted of multiple thefts. All verdicts were
 reviewed by a court of appeals and the Yemeni Supreme Court
 before punishment was carried out. There are believed to be
 several hundred similar cases pending. Despite official
 decrees banning their use, shackles are still in use in a
 number of Yemeni prisons. Mentally ill persons are also
 occasionally shackled.
 A Yemeni press story in February on prison conditions in Sanaa
 central prison reported on unsafe and unsanitary facilities,
 imprisonment of children, frequent use of torture and
 humiliation, and failure to release prisoners who complete
 their prison terms. The report also stated that prison
 authorities regularly attempted to hide these conditions from
 visiting Yemeni parliamentary groups. In April the Parliament
 passed a law intended to correct prison abuses. However, the
 law remains unimplemented in virtually all its aspects.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 There were continuing reports of arbitrary arrest. Some
 detainees were held without charge for extended periods of
 time, despite a constitutional provision limiting to 24 hours
 the time the police may hold a suspect without judicial
 concurrence. Relatives of the accused are sometimes held while
 compensation of the victim or victim's relatives is
 negotiated. In October the Government announced the release of
 
 
 1637
 YEMEN
 approximately 700 persons from.Sanaa prison whose cases had
 been reviewed by the Ministry of Justice. Some of these
 persons had been in prison for up to 10 years. These prisoners
 had been transferred to federal prisons following unification
 from outlying prisons, in most cases without documentation
 concerning'sentences or crimes committed. An unknown number of
 prisoners. in this category remain in custody. The Government
 has said that it will continue to investigate such cases.
 Legal procedures which allow prisoners to notify relatives and
 lawyers of their arrest are seldom observed, or observed only
 upon payment of a bribe, especially in cases of arrests by
 security officials-. The'Constitution prohibits the exile of
 Yemeni citizens or the prevention of their return to Yemen.
 Many political dissidents returned to Yemen after unification,
 although several prominent Yemenis, including former PDRY
 President Ali Nasir Muhammad, remain in self-imposed exile.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 In August the Government announced the reorganization of the
 courts and the appointment of 48 new members of the Supreme
 Court. Membership in thefSupreme.Court includes Yemenis from
 both north and south. However, the precise jurisdiction of- the
 Supreme Court, especially over issues arising in the south, is
 yet to be determined, and essentially there continue to be two
 judicial systems in the country,.divided along preunification
 lines. The new judicial'authority is intended to expand
 significantly the rights of Yemeni citizens by giving them, for
 the first time, a practical means to seek redress of
 grievances. It also subjects decisions by military courts to
 review by the-Supreme Court. The lower courts have not yet
 been merged, however, and the former court systems of the YAR
 and the PDRY continue to function in their respective'halves, of
 the country.. In that part of Yemen which was formerly the YAR,-
 there are two court systems: .Shari'a (criminal and family) and
 commercial. The Shari'a courts are based on Islamic-law and,
 viewed within their traditional Islamic context (e.g. 'no jury
 trials), are widely considered to be impartial. Defendants are
 notified of the precise charges pending against them at the
 conclusion of the police'investigation. The judge actively
 questions witnesses. Attorneys are allowed to counsel their
 clients and may also address the court and examine witnesses.
 Litigants in'-ommercial dourts'cah generally expect a fair and
 open trial with legal counsel, although tribal ties and bribery -,
 are said to play a role in some judicial proceedings.
 Defendants enjoy the right of appeal and generally open court
 sessions. The Shari'a and commercial courts are largely
 independent of the executive, but judicial authorities have
 complained of executive branch interference in sensitive cases
 and of.the continued existence of extrajudicial prisons
 maintained in some ministries and controlled by the ministers.
 The former YAR state security courts were. formally-abolished
 after unification.
 In the former PDRY, there was no separation of powers,
 according to the Constitution, between the executive,
 legislative, and the judicial branches. Pending thefinal
 reorganization of the Yemeni judiciary, there are three court
 systems: magistrate or divisional courts, provincial.courts,
 and military courts. Magistrate's courts have jurisdiction
 over most crimes, traffic offenses, juvenile cases, family
 cases, housing and agrarian disputes, and minor civil matters.
 Provincial courts have jurisdiction over serious criminal cases
 
 
 1638
 YEMEN
 involving the death sentence or long prison terms, inheritance
 cases, major civil claims, and appeals from magistrates'
 courts. The military courts have jurisdiction over crimes
 within the armed forces.
 The current unified Government, as did its predecessors, denies
 that it holds any political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Constitution specifically provides for the freedom and
 confidentiality of mail, telephones, telegrams, and other means
 of communication, except in cases-determined by law and a court
 order. "The.Constitution also specifies that residences, places
 of worship, and educational institutions are not to be searched
 except in cases specified by law. Nevertheless, security
 forces routinely search homes, monitor telephones, read
 personal mail, and otherwise intrude into personal matters for
 alleged security reasons.
 Contact between Yemenis and foreigners, particularly diplomats,
 is selectively monitored by the security forces, and Yemeni
 visitors to foreign embassies and consulates are sometimes
 questioned by security guards. These procedures tend to
 discourage contact between Yemenis and diplomats.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The new Constitution provides for freedom of speech and press
 "within the limits of the law." Many Yemenis remain cautious
 in exercising their freedom of speech, but the trend is toward
 more openness. Discussions at social gatherings are generally
 frank, but some Yemenis believe they may experience difficulty
 if security agents overhear them criticizing particular
 government leaders. After unification, there was a significant
 relaxation of restrictions on freedom of the press. Almost 90
 new independent newspapers, representing diverse political
 viewpoints, began publication and are distributed widely
 throughout the country. Some criticized government leaders by
 name, and many criticized the Government's domestic policies.
 The Government censored or stopped distribution of independent
 papers that commented on sensitive issues related to the.
 Persian Gulf War and on Yemen's relations with Saudi Arabia.
 On August 20, Prime Minister Al-Attas was quoted in the
 government daily Al-Thawra as saying that no papers should
 engage in criticism of "friendly" states, a statement widely
 interpreted as a warning to the press.
 The Ministry of Information owns and operates Yemen's radio and
 television stations, as well as several major newspapers.
 Yemen's two television channels regularly broadcast
 parliament4ry sessions. A number of foreign English-language
 and Arabic-language newspapers and magazines are available in
 the cities. Occasionally, the Government has prevented the
 distribution of foreign Arabic-language publications deemed to
 contain material critical of Yemen and its leaders. In
 addition, both foreigners and Yemenis are regularly scrutinized
 at customs points, and materials of either a religious or
 political nature, as well as material considered pornographic,
 are often confiscated. Self-censorship'is sometimes practiced
 at Sanaa University, where professors and senior administrators
 require a security clearance before being hired. However,
 
 
 1639
 there are no reports that professors complain about government
 interference in their teaching programs or curriculum
 development.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful-Assembly and Association
 Article 39 of the new Constitution provides for freedom of
 association. Following unification, professional, labor,
 educational, and social organizations of the former YAR and
 PDRY began to unite, although philosophical differences between
 Muslim activists and leftists on occasion still hinder the
 formation of unified organizations. These organizations must
 be registered with the Ministry of Social Security and Social
 Affairs.
 The Minister of Interior has formally reiterated the right of
 Yemeni citizens to demonstrate peacefully. There were a number
 of demonstrations concerning missing and imprisoned persons,
 women's rights, the Gulf crisis, and secondary school and
 university curriculums', most of which took place in what was
 formerly the PDRY. Citizens regularly demonstrate peacefully
 in front of the President's office, Parliament, and provincial
 government offices to voice their views on domestic economic
 issues. However, some violent political demonstrations by
 students at Sanaa University were put down by force.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Islam is the state religion in Yemen, and there are some
 restrictions on the practice of other religions. Most Yemenis
 are Muslims, either members of the Zaydi (Shi'a) sect or the
 Shafi'i (Sunni) school of jurisprudence. Islamic associations
 with ties to pan-Islamic organizations enjoy a degree of
 freedom, including the right to operate schools'largely
 independent of the national school system. Radical Islamic
 revival is not a major force in Yemen, although-Muslim
 activists increasingly assert their points of-view on social
 and political issues.
 Although almost all of the once substantial Yemeni Jewish
 population .has emigrated, between 1,000 and 1,500 remain,
 mostly scattered in northern rural areas. No synagogues are
 allowed and there are no native rabbis, but Jews are able to
 practice their religion in private homes. The Government has
 allowed foreign Jewish groups to meet with Yemeni Jews, to
 distribute Hebrew-language religious materials and-religious
 articles, and to establish a religious school in a northern
 Yemeni town, and has recently indicated that more foreign
 travel by Yemeni Jews will be permitted.
 There are no indigenous Christian Yemenis. Foreign Christians
 and the Indian-origin Christian community of Aden are
 permitted, like Jews, to conduct private services, but churches
 are not allowed. Indian Hindus maintain temples in Aden, which
 benefit from some government support. Foreign clergy are not
 allowed to proselytize, but some teach or work in social
 services.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the'Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Freedom of travel within Yemen, guaranteed by the Constitution,
 is respected throughout the country, although there are some
 checkpoints on major roads. Foreigners are no longer required
 to obtain prior permission for travel outside the capital.
 
 
 1640
 The Yemeni Constitution provides for free emigration, and the
 Government recognizes the importance to the economy of foreign
 remittances from the many Yemenis who historically have sought
 employment abroad. The right of return is also respected; in
 1991 Saudi Arabia's decision to end Yemenis' immigration and
 residency privileges resulted in the return to Yemen of an
 estimated 750,000 to 1 million Yemenis. In spite of the
 constitutional provision, Jews, with few exceptions, have been
 unable to emigrate.
 Procedures for obtaining passports and the necessary exit visas
 are sometimes onerous, especially for Yemeni men who have not
 completed their military service. Travel by a small number of
 Yemeni Jews, especially to the United States for medical and
 educational purposes, began in 1990 and increased somewhat in
 1991. Senior Yemeni officials, including President Saleh, have
 publicly reaffirmed the right-of all Yemenis to travel abroad.
 Although precise numbers are not available, an estimated 10,000
 refugees dislocated during civil wars in Somalia and Ethiopia
 have been granted asylum in Yemen. About 1,100 Eritrean
 refugees from Ethiopia remain at a camp near the coastal town
 of al-Khawkha. Because of the existence in Yemen of a
 substantial population from the Horn of Africa, many of these
 refugees have been able to find work in the Yemeni economy.
 The Government closely monitors all political activity by
 refugees.
 Many of the Palestinians who arrived in Yemen from Lebanon in
 1982-83 have departed; the remainder live in camps near Sanaa
 and Aden and are closely watched by security services. The
 movement and activity of the Palestinians are restricted,
 particularly in the north. Palestinians residing in Aden have
 traditionally enjoyed greater freedom of movement and
 activity. Palestinians have been able to develop businesses in
 the north which have provided some employment opportunities.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right bf Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Although the citizens of the YAR and the PDRY were not able to
 change their governments peacefully, the citizens of the
 unified Yemen will now, in theory, have that right under the
 new Constitution which provides for multiparty parliamentary
 elections with secret ballot and universal adult suffrage.
 This right will be tested for the first time by November 1992,
 when the Constitution calls for holding elections for a united
 Yemeni Parliament.
 All the top leaders of the YAR and PDRY remained in power after
 unification. Even before unification, while technically
 illegal in both the YAR and the PDRY, new political parties
 began to organize. Article 39 of the Constitution, which
 allows freedom of association for political, professional, and
 labor organizations, is generally interpreted as permitting
 political parties. In October the Yemeni Parliament passed a
 political parties law. Parties were restricted to the extent
 that their programs could not- oppose the Islamic religion or
 the goals of the Yemeni revolutions, or violate Yemeni
 international commitments. A committee is to be established
 which will judge whether any of these principles have been
 violated. 'The law also provided for government financial
 support for recognized political parties and allowed parties to
 establish their own newspapers. More than 40 parties had been
 formed by year's end.
 
 
 1641
 Under the arrangements in force during the 30-month
 transitional period, the transitional Parliament is charged
 with enacting new laws to unify ministries, other government
 bodies, and legal codes until the first unified Parliament is
 elected. The 301-member transitional Parliament- consists of
 159 members from the former YAR Consultative Assembly, 111
 members from the former PDRY Supreme People's Council
 (including 10 women), and 31 specially appointed members. The
 Constitution gives broad powers to the Parliament: these
 include electing the Presidential Council, withdrawing
 confidence from the Government, questioning the Prime Minister
 and government ministers, ratifying international agreements,
 and approving the budget. The transitional Parliament has also
 asserted its authority by vetoing several government-sponsored
 bills or demanding their modification. It has-been vigorous in
 questioning representatives from government ministries on
 budget and policy matters.
 A five-member Presidential Council with broad executive powers
 has been functioning since Yemeni unification. Its chairman is
 the former YAR President, Ali Abdullah Saleh, and its vice
 chairman, the Yemeni Socialist Party (YSP) Secretary General
 Ali Salem al-Bidh. The Council appointed Haydar Abu Bakr
 al-Attas Prime Minister in May 1990, and he formed a
 39-ministry government with approximately equal representation
 between northerners and southerners. In addition, a 45-member
 Consultative Council was appointed by the Presidential Council
 to advise the Government on broad policy issues. This body is
 not called for in the Constitution but is a transitional
 institution which is expected to disappear at the end of a
 30-month period.
 The majority of members of Parliament, all members of the
 Presidential Council, and most government ministers belong to
 one of Yemen's two dominant political organizations, the former
 YAR's General People's Congress (GPC) and the former PDRY's
 YSP. However, there are distinct groupings with overlapping
 agendas within the Parliament: rightists, Socialists,
 traditional tribesmen, technocrats, and Muslim activists.
 Although the transitional Parliament is not organized on a
 party basis, some of the parties other than the YSP and GPC are
 represented in it.
 Women may vote and hold office without restriction, although
 this right is limited by cultural tradition.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 An officially sanctioned human rights organization exists as a
 committee of the Parliament. In May it met with
 representatives of Amnesty International (AI). Attempts to
 form a nongovernmental human rights organization have been
 frustrated both by government opposition and infighting between
 leftists and Muslim activists.
 The Government permitted AI to investigate prison conditions
 and allegations regarding political prisoners during October
 and November of 1990. In the past, neither the YAR nor PDRY
 had permitted any organization to investigate possible human
 rights violations.
 
 
 1642
 
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 The Constitution prohibits any discrimination based on sex,
 color, origin, language, occupation, social status, or
 religious belief. In fact, however, the remaining small Jewish
 community does suffer discrimination and is fearful of
 persecution by extremist groups.
 Although Yemeni Jews generilly enjoy good relations with their
 Muslim neighbors, there was religiously inspired agitation
 against the Jewish community in the town of Raydah. Violent
 incidents do occur periodically, especially in the
 countryside. There is no indication, however, that such
 agitatibn is inspired or condoned by the Government. Yemen's
 Jewish community traditionally looked to local tribal chiefs
 rather than the central Government for protection. Although
 this practice still continues to some degree, the Government
 also recognizes its responsibility to protect the civil rights
 of the largely rural, isolated Jewish community, both at the
 local level and through the intervention of senior government
 officials in Sanaa. Jews generally travel freely within
 Yemen.
 Some Yemeni citizens with a non-Yemeni parent do not enjoy the
 full range of constitutional rights. These people, known as
 muwalladin, face both institutionalized and informal
 discrimination. For example, the Constitution requires that
 members of the Presidential Council be "born of Yemeni
 parents." Sanaa University, administered by the Government,
 applies the same restriction when hiring teaching and senior
 administrative staff, as does Yemen's military academy in
 selebting applicants. However, discrimination against
 muwalladin is not universal or pervasive. Many senior
 government officials, including ministers, are muwalladin.
 Some muwalladin complain that they are required to pay
 substantial bribes to receive residency permits, passports, and
 other official documentation. Another smaller group known as
 akhdam, the descendants of former slaves, also faces persistent
 social discrimination.
 Although the Constitution provides for equality under the law,
 significant restrictions on women are imposed by culture and
 tradition and by law. The Government has not yet passed a
 unified family law. Consequently, the original YAR and PDRY
 laws remain in effect. YAR family law has been dominated by
 tribal customs and local traditions, influenced and modified by
 Shari'a law. Polygamy is allowed, husbands may divorce their
 wives without justifying their actions before the court, and,.
 in cases of divorce, both the family home and the children
 automatically go to the father. There are frequent cases of
 child marriage in the more traditional, rural areas. The
 institution of dowry payments is widespread. The amount of
 payments is steadily increasing in spite of government attempts
 to limit their size.
 The postindependence PDRY government enacted legislation to
 emancipate Yemeni women. A 1974 law, modeled after the divorce
 law of Tunisia, restricted polygamy by requiring permission of
 the court for a second marriage, prohibited child marriages,
 and provided for a considerable degree of female protection,
 including equal rights in divorce. However, the protections
 afforded by this law were considerably weaker outside of Aden,
 where tribal custom often prevailed.
 
 
 1643
 YEMEN
 In Aden women now work in middle-level jobs in several
 ministries and also in banks and other businesses. Yemen's
 largest factory group employs women on the same pay scalb as
 men, and women there have risen through the ranks to lower
 management positions.
 There are female judges and lawyers in Aden. The unified
 Parliament voted in September 1990 not to discriminate by sex
 in enumerating the qualificatibns for judges, prosecutors,-and
 lawyers.
 Societal pressures often force women to defer-to the guidance
 of male colleagues and the general supervision of male
 relatives. -Women seeking exit visas are often asked to prove
 that male relatives do not object to their travel. Education
 for women in significant numbers began-in-the YAR only at the
 end of the civil war in 1970; education for women in the PDRY
 was more advanced. An estimated 85-percent of all Yemeni women
 are illiterate, compared to 46 percent-of all men.
 A form of female genital.mutilation, clitorectomy, is practiced
 in the Red Sea coastal region, the Tihama, especially among
 Yemenis of African origin. -The extent of the practice is
 unknown. While some individual government health workers in
 the Tihama actively discourage clitorectomy,.there is no
 government directive or guidance against the-practice.
 Conservative social mores prevent'public discussion or
 government acknowledgement-of the practice.
 Wife beating and other physical abuse-of women occurs in Yemeni
 families, but:there is virtually no public discussion of the
 subject and little Is known about its extent. -The female
 victim usually turns to her-male relative to pressure the
 perpetrator to stop the'abuse; she may seek a legal remedy in-
 court, but social traditions usually impel women and their male
 relatives to.seek mediation and keep the matter within the
 extended family.'
 The government-sponsored women's .associations of the former YAR
 and PDRY, which promoted female education and civic
 responsibilities, merged in 1990.
 Section 6 'Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 As the united Yemen has not yet enacted a new labor code, the
 Labor Codes-for the former YAR-and PDRY remain in effect for
 their respective parts of the country.
 In both the YAR and PDRY, labor unions were closely controlled,
 if not organized by the-Government. Under the YAR Labor Code,
 a union may be set up by 100 or more workers upon application
 -to and approval by government authorities. The Code prescribes
 a single union system with one union committee per enterprise,
 one union branch per locality, one general union per economic
 sector, and one national umbrella organization, which was the
 Yemeni Trade Union Confederation. Government employees- and
 some categories of farm workers are excluded from union
 membership. Under the YAR Labor Code, the Council of Ministers
 may dissolve trade unions without judicial action. It also
 prohibits unions from engaging in any political activity, and
 their financial records are subject to government oversight.
 YAR trade unions were reported to be-under heavy security
 
 
 1644
 YEMEN
 forces' influence and were not known to challenge the
 Government.
 In the YAR, labor-related legislation neither allowed nor
 disallowed strikes. In late 1990, a strike by engineers in the
 Ministry of Public Works was put down violently by ministry
 police forces.. In the first part of 1991, a strike by oil
 workers in the fields operated by an American company was
 settled after negotiations involving the workers, the company,
 and senior Oil and Labor Ministry officials.
 In the PDRY, the General Federation-of Trade Unions (GFTU), the
 only labor association, was under close YSP control. There
 were a number of strikes in southern Yemen in 1990. In the
 spring 6f 1991, strikes against the high cost of living were
 threatened in Aden, but a work stoppage was averted through
 negotiations. The YAR and PDRY labor confederations merged in
 1990, forming the Yemeni Confederation of Labor Unions (YCLU).
 The YCLU is affliated with the International Confederation of
 Arab Trade Unions and the Communist-dominated World Federation
 of Trade Unions.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 Although the YAR Labor Code calls on employers to treat workers
 collectively, it does not contain provisions to ensure worker
 protection against acts of discrimination by employers, nor
 does it provide for a system of collective bargaining, There
 are consequently no formal collective bargaining agreements
 now in force. Unions do negotiate wage settlements for their
 members and have often resorted to strikes or other job actions
 to achieve their demands. Frequent strikes by the petroleum
 (tanker truck) drivers transport union are-believed to have
 resulted in substantial wage increases over the past year.
 Pilots for Yemenia, the national airline, have also sought
 higher wages and cost-of-living adjustments through collective
 bargaining. According to the Labor Code, dollective agreements
 must be registered and may be unilaterally revoked by the
 Government if they do not conform with the security and
 economic interests of the country.
 The YAR was criticized by the International Labor Organization
 (ILO) for portions of its Labor Code that conflict with ILO
 conventions. Until a new labor code is passed for unified
 Yemen, workers in the north enjoy limited protections under the
 YAR Labor Code. In the PDRY, the State, through the
 YSP-controlled unions, purported to represent the rights of the
 workers. There was no collective bargaining, and there were no
 nongovernmental bodies that addressed labor grievances.
 Nevertheless, the wave of strikes in 1990 necessitated
 bargaining between workers and state management.
 A small special export processing zone in the port of Aden
 remained inactive.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Forced or compulsory labor is forbidden by the Constitution,
 and there are no-reports of it in practice.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 There was no minimum age for employmient of children in the YAR,
 but compulsory education requirements--when enforced--limited
 the employment of children. These requirements were generally
 
 
 1645
 YEMEN
 ignored, however. Labor by minors aged 12 to 14 was regulated
 by the Labor Code. In the PDRY, the Labor Code prohibited the
 employment of children (defined as between 7 and 12 years of
 age) and young persons (between 12 and 16 years of age).
 -However, apprentice employment of young persons aged 14 and
 older was permitted.
 Throughout-Yemen, child labor is common, particularly in rural'
 areas. For the most part, it is sanctioned by family tradition
 and it is not uncommon to see children working in workshops or
 stores. In the south, child labor often occurs on family,
 cooperative, and.state farms.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 There was no established minimum wage in the YAR. In the
 former PDRY, the labor laws set a minimum wage which provided a
 worker a minimal standard of living. The prevailing daily wage
 for unskilled labor in Yemen allows a very modest standard of
 living for a worker with a family.
 YAR legal codes prescribe a maximum 8-hour workday (6 during
 Ramadan), but some workshops operate 10- or 12-hour shifts
 without.penalty. The YAR Labor Code does not prescribe the
 number of workdays, only that the maximum workweek consist of
 48 hours. The PDRY Labor Code stipulates a 42-hour workweek.
