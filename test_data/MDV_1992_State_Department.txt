 MALDIVES
 The Republic of Maldives has a parliamentary form of government with a strong
 executive. In practice, government authority in this small, homogeneous society
 rests largely in the hands of the President and a number of powerful Cabinet min-
 isters. Political parties are officially discouraged. Candidates for the unicameral leg-
 islature, the Citizens' Majlis, rur, as individuals. The Majlis selects a single nominee
 for president who is subsequently approved or rejected by the voters. In 1988 Presi-
 dent Maumoon Abdul Gayoom began a third 5-year term after being nominated by
 the Majlis and approved by 95 percent of those voting in a referendum.
 The National Security Service (NSS), which includes the army and police, is re-
 sponsible for maintaining internal law and order as well as defending the country.
 The police division investigates crimes, does other security intelligence work makes
 arrests, and enforces house arrest. Maldives has a small military service. 4o infor-
 mation is available on military expenditures, nor is there is any indication that ef-
 forts will be made to reduce military expenditures in the near future, especially
 since the Government believes the existing military forces are too small to protect
 the extensive shoreline.

 Maldives is comprised of 1,190 islands in 26 natural atolls scattered across an
 area 500 miles long by 75 miles wide in the Indian Ocean. The population totals
 some 225,000 persons.
 Nearly half the work force engages in traditional activities such as fishing and
 small-scale ariculture. Industry accounts for only 14 percent of the gross national
 product. Tourism is the largest foreign exchange earner.
 The Government continues to restrict human rights closely in several areas, in-
 cluding speech and press, religion, the right of citizens to change their government,
 and women's and workers' rights. Other problems include instances of arbitrary ar-
 rest and incommunicado detention and lack of an independent judiciary. The dis-
 sident press has been effectively eliminated as a result of government revocation of
 press registrations and other actions over the last 3 years (see Section 2.a.). Some
 of these restrictions, on religion and women's rights, for example, are linked with
 the observance of the Shari a (Islamic law) and other Islamic principles and cus-
 toms.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of such
 killings.
 b. tisappearance.-There were no reports of disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 There were no reports in 1992 that persons were beaten while in police custody. At
 times prisoners are held incommunicado as a way to extract confessions. Convicted
 criminals are floggedunder judicial supervision when this punishment is prescribed
 by the Shari's. Usually, however, punishment is confined to fines, compensatory
 payment, house arrest, imprisonment, or banishment to a remote and sparsely pop-
 ulated atoll. Banishment is onsidered a particularly severe punishment because the
 banished person is not allowed visits by family members.
 Police authorities said they initiated several measures to improve prison condi-
 tions, including allowing regular visits by relatives and permission for prisoners to
 earn income by pursuing their occupations in prison. Political prisoners and drug
 offenders are excluded from this reform, however. A bill specifying the rights of the
 accused and convicted, proposed in the Majlis in 1990, was dropped when its spon-
 sor left Parliament.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution states that "no person
 shall be apprehended, except on a verdict specified by Shari'a or (civil) law." Police
 undertake investigations either on suspicion of criminal activity or in response to
 a formal written complaint alleging commission of a crime. Depending on the results
 of the police investigation, the Attorney General may refer the case to the appro-
 priate court. Complainants may also directly petition a court for its intervention. It
 is customary not to disclose to the public the details of the charges against a person
 until it has been established that the charges are likely to be upheld.
 Persons under investigation generally are free pendingtrial, provided they do not
 leave a specified atoll. There is no provision under Maldivian law for bail. Depend-
 ing on the charges, however, a suspect may be imprisoned or placed under house
 arrest without trial for 15 days while the case is being investigated. In most cases
 not brought to trial within 15 days, the subject is freed. After the first 15 days, de-
 tention or house arrest may be extended for 30 days by authority of the President.
 There is no limit on the detention of persons suspected of such crimes as illegal drug
 use, terrorism, or attempted overthrow of the Government. As a result, such detain-
 ees may be held without trial indefinitely. Neither is there a requirement in law
 that persons be formally charged before being detained on suspicion, so some sus-
 pects especially for political offenses, have been imprisoned or held under house ar-
 rest for weeks or months without charge. Some detainees reportedly have been held
 without access to lawyers, friends, or family. Persons held under house arrest may
 be prohibited visits by nonfamily members and access to a telephone.
 Most of the more than 50 persons arrested in November 1990 on a variety of
 charges-which included terrorism and political subversion but which appear to
 have been exaggerated-have been either released or tried, convicted, and sentenced
 to terms of imprisonment or banishment to outer atolls. There were no such arrests
 in 1992. Several of the prisoners arrested in 1990 are believed, however, still to be
 in police custody or under house arrest without having had a proper trial.
 There were no cases of foreign exile in 1992. The practice of deportation to remote
 atolls is a form of internal exile.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial-There are eight lesser courts and a High Court
 in Male'. The High Court handles a wide range of cases, including politically sen-
 
 
 1149
 sitive ones, and acts as a court of appeal. Each of the lesser courts deals with spe-
 cialized cases, such as debt, theft, or property claims. On other islands, there are
 all-purpose courts. There are no jury trials. Most trials are open to the public and
 conducted by judges trained in Islamic law. The trials of persons charged with polit-
 ical crimes are not open to the public, however, and are not covered by the press.
 Cases on outer islands are usually adjudicated by traditional legal practitioners, but
 more complex legal questions are referred to the appropriate specialized court in
 Male'. The Male' court may in turn refer the issue to four judges attached to the
 Justice Ministry. All judges are appointed by the President and serve at his pleas-
 ure; they are not subject to confirmation by the Citizens' Ma lis. The High Court
 falls under the authority of the Office of the President. Under te law, the President
 has the final word in all legal cases and, according to some reports, occasionally has
 reviewed court decisions.
 During trial, the accused may defend himself and call witnesses. He also may be
 assisted by a lawyer, but most. defendants do not use them because there are few
 professionally trained lawyers. Courts do not provide lawyers to defendants who
 cannot obtain legal counsel on their own. Traditional Islamic judges question the
 concerned parties and attempt to establish the facts of a case as well as reach a
 legal judgment. Generally, the length and type of sentence are established by law
 and custom. No reliable estimates exist of the number of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution prohibits opening, intercepting, or reading letters, telephone conversa-
 tions, telegrams, and wireless messages exchanged between persons "except in ac-
 cordance with the specific provisions of the law." The NSS sometimes opens the mail
 of private citizens and notifies them that it has done so. There are indications that
 telephones may be tapped; in 1990, for example, a politically embarrassing tape of
 a telephonec lbyagovernment minister suspected of embezzlement mysteriously
 surfaced in Male'. The Constitution requires that private premises and dwellings be
 respectd but there is no legal requirement for search or arrest warrants, and pri-
 vate residences are sometimes searched by police officials without prior warning.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including
 a. reedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution prvides for freedom of speech
 and expression "so long as the specific prvisions of Shari'a and the law are not con-
 travened." In practice, freedom of speech, press, and broadcast are sharply re-
 stricted. Under Maldivian law and custom, a citizen may criticize or complain to the
 Government without fear if he does so through recognized channels. These include
 letters or oral complaints to the President, a Majils member, a civil servant, or other
 person in authority. A prvision of the penal code makes illegal those actions that
 arouse the people against the Government. In November 1990, the 17th amendment
 to this law decriminalized "any true account of any act of commission or omission
 past or present by the Government in a lawfully re'ostred newspaper  rmagazine,
 so as to reveal dissatisfaction or to effect its reform. Although thi amendment may
 eventually have an impact on freedom of expression, it has had no appreciable effect
 thus far.
 The detention, harassment, and threats against journalists that occurred after a
 short period of unprecedente press freedom in ealy 1990 eliminated the dissident
 press and created a persisting atmosphere in which a number of journalists are
 afraid to publish articles critical of the Government. The Government has also
 begun to hold printers responsible for the material they print, resulting in the print-
 era refusal to accept anfr   even slightly controversial.
 Seventy-six newspapers and periodicals are registered, of which 13 are published
 by the Government. The only two dailies are owned by government ministers. Two
 politically outspoken newspapers, Sangu and Hukuro, whose official registrations
 were revoked in mid-1990, remain closed. The two journalists affiliated with Sangu
 who were among the 50 persons detained in 1990 have been tried and sentenced,
 and both are now under house arrest. A human rights organization has received re-
 ports that one of these detainees, Sangu editor Mohammed Shafeeq, confessed
 under duress to involvement in a fire bombing and other efforts to cause public dis-
 order.
 There is no prior censorship of newspapers, but officials in the Department of In-
 formation an dBroadcasting sometimes call publishers to point out that certain arti-
 cles are unacceptable for political o other reasons. Publications may be banned for
 containing criticisms of the Government "based on falsehood and unfounded specula-
 tion." The Government also reserves the right to take action against journalists who
 "bring discredit and dishonor to individuals or groups through the malicious use of
 mass media and create social unrest among the general public." Because these regu-
 
 
 1150
 lations are often broadly construed, self-censorship is well ingrained among writers
 and editors.
 The Government owns and operates the only television and radio stations. Foreign
 broadcasts are not jammed.
 There are no legal prohibitions on the import of foreign publications, except those
 containing pornography or material otherwise deemed objectionable in terms of Is-
 lamic values. No seizure of foreign publications was reported in 1992.
 b. Freedom of Peacefid Assembly and Association.-Article 15 of the Constitution
 guarantees Maldivians the right to assemble as long as they do not violate the law
 or the Islamic code of behavior. Public political meetings are permitted during elec-
 toral campaigns, with Home Ministry permission, but so far political meetings have
 been limited to small gatherings on private premises. Clubs and other private asso-
 ciations are permitted if they do not contravene Shari'a and civil law. They must
 be registered with the Government.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-Freedom of religion is significantly restricted. The Con-
 stitution designates Islam as the official religion and-requires all citizens to be Mus-
 lims. A recent constitutional amendment makes it possible for Maldivian citizens le-
 gally to be members of the Shi'a as well as the Sunni sect of Islam. There are no
 places of worship for adherents of any other religion, and the importation of figu-
 rines for worship is prohibited. Clergy and missionaries of non-Muslim faiths may
 enter Maldives but are forbidden to proselytize or hold public worship services. Con-
 version of a Muslim to another faith is a violation of Shari'a law and could result
 in loss of citizenship for the Maldivian convert, although law enforcement authori-
 ties say this provision of the law has never been applied. The practice of any reli-
 gion other than Islam is prohibited by law. However, citizens of other nations resi-
 dent in Maldives are allowed to practice their religion if they do so privately.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-There are no formal restrictions on freedom of movement within the
 Maldives. Although no law explicitly prohibits migration to the capital island of
 Male' or its surrounding atoll, these have become so overcrowded that the Govern-
 ment discourages migration there except for short periods of work, education, or
 medical treatment. There are no arbitrary restrictions on foreign travel or emigra-
 tion. A Maldivian who has acquired another nationality must maintain Maldivian
 nationality concurrently and must enter and leave Maldives on a Maldivian pass-
 port. The Government is not known to have revoked the citizenship of any
 Maldivian. There are no refugees or displaced persons. As far as is known, no
 Maldivians have been exiled abroad or are refugees or displaced persons elsewhere.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Maldives traditionally has been governed by a limited circle of persons, and
 Maldivians have only limited and indirect influence on the selection and organiza-
 tion of their government. A change in leadership could come about only through in-
 direct means, such as a group of reform-minded parliamentarians blocking renomi-
 nation of the President. This has never occurred. The President and several key
 members of his Cabinet wield controlling power. A single nominee for president,
 who constitutionally must be male and a Sunni Muslim, is chosen by secret ballot
 in the Majlis from as many candidates as are proposed by members. His nomination
 is confirmed or rejected in a nationwide referendum, also by secret ballot. President
 Gayoom was elected for a third 5-year term by this process in 1988, receiving 95
 percent of the popular vote.
 Members of the Citizens' Majlis, a unicameral legislature, are chosen for 5-year
 terms by secret ballot. All Maldivians over 21 years of age may vote. Of the body's
 48 members, 40 are elected-2 from each of the 19 inhabited atolls and 2 from
 Male'--and the President appoints 8. Individuals or groups are free to approach
 members of the Majlis with grievances or opinions on proposed legislation. The most
 recent Majlis election was held in November 1989. Under the Constitution, Islamic
 law rather than the Majlis has legal preeminence. The President, in addition to
 being the Head of Government and State, is responsible for the protection of Islam
 in the Maldives.
 While not expressly forbidden by law, political parties in practice are not per-
 mitted. President Gayoom has publicly discouraged their formation, declaring politi-
 cal parties inappropriate to the homogeneous Maldivian society, at least for the
 present. In place of political parties, factions in the Majlis tend to form around indi-
 viduals or points of view. Any member may introduce legislation. If seconded, it
 must be considered by the entire legislative body. The Majlis may not interpellate
 ministers but may send them written questions to answer and call for their removal.
 The Government has said that members of the Majlis are protected by law for state-
 
 
 1151
 ments made during Majlis debates; however, since the arrest and banishment of a
 member of the Ma*lis in 1990 on charges which were not made public, and the har-
 assment of several others for outspokenness in 1990 and 1991, the atmosphere in
 the Majlis reportedly has become more subdued than it was in early 1990. The
 Mailis still, however, proposes new legislation and debates some draft bills vigor-
 ously.
 Women are not eligible to become president but may hold all other government
 posts. For reasons of tradition and culture, however, few women seek or are selected
 )or public office. In 1992 two women served in the 48-member Majlis. There were
 no female members of the Cabinet.
 There is no identifiable indigenous ethnic group in Maldives. The Maldivian popu-
 lation is a complex amalgam of cultural and racial influences from South Asia, Per-
 sia, the Arabian Peninsula and Africa.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 An association calling itself the Law Society of the Maldives, with the professed
 aim of protecting the legal and constitutional ri hts of Maldivians, was registered
 with the Government in mid-1990 but has never become active. In general, the Gov-
 ernment does not welcome international human rights organizations or the human
 rights inquiries of foreign governments, considering them  an intrusion into
 MYaldives' domestic affairs. The Government responded to a report on Maldives by
 Amnesty International (AI), published in January 1991, with a letter that com-
 plained about alleged inaccuracies. Later in 1991, however, the Government per-
 mitted a foreiTg" lawyer representing AI to meet with its officials to gather informa-
 tion on the tnal of a number of political prisoners. In October a three-member dele-
 gation from Al visited Male' for 3 days. The delegation was received by the Govern-
 ment but did not meet with private citizens or visit places of detention.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Language, or Social Status
 Women traditionally have played a subordinate role in Maldivian society, al-
 though they now participate in public life in growing numbers and gradually at
 higher levels. Well-educated Maldivian women report that although the upward pro-
 fessional mobility of women is not limited by statute, the education, career choices,
 and achievement of women is circumscribed by cultural norms and expectations. Be-
 cause Islamic practice is the basis for Maldivian civil law, it is easier for husbands
 to divorce wives than vice versa. Islamic law also governs inheritance, according
 men twice the share of women. Women who work for wages-for the Government,
 in business, or in garment factories-generally receive pay equal to that of men in
 the same positions. Approximately 10 percent of uniformed NSS personnel are now
 female.
 The Government has shown interest in promoting the welfare of women in both
 the public and private sectors. A Department of Women's Affairs and a National
 Women's Council have been created and have organized seminars and counseling
 sessions to promote an awareness of women's rights and their role in a developing
 nation and to expand opportunities for them in nontraditional occupations. These
 efforts must contend, however, with conservative sentiment among small business-
 men and residents of the outer islands due largely to orthodox Islamic training,
 which opposes women being active outside the home.
 There are no firm data on the extent of violence against women. Violence against
 women is probably underreported to authorities because of the value attached topri-
 vacy within the family in this conservative society. Police officials report that they
 receive only three or four complaints of assaults against women each year, and
 Maldivian women's rights advocates agree that wife beating and other forms of vio-
 lence are not widespread. Rape and other violent crimes against women are rare.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Maldives has a work force numbering some 57,000
 persons, about 40 percent of, whom are employed in traditional fishing. The great
 majority of economically active Maldivians work outside the wage sector. Employ-
 ment statistics do not exist, but the industrial sector employs only a few thousand
 persons, accounting for about 13 percent of gross domestic product.
 While unions are not expressly prohibited, the Government recognizes neither the
 ri ht to form them nor the right to strike.
 T. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Workers' rights to organize
 and bargain collectively are neither recognized nor protected by law. Wages in the
 private sector are set by contract between employers and individual employees and
 are usually based on the rates for similar work in the public sector.
 There are no export processing zones.
 
 
 1152
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-There is no legal code regulating
 the conditions of labor. Forced or compulsory labor is not prohibited, but there are
 no reports that it is practiced.
 d. Minimum Age For Employment of Children.-There is no compulsory education
 law. However, in 1990 some 77 percent of those 5 to 19 years of age were enrolled
 in government or private schools, and the Government is trying to make schools
 available to all children. A law passed in 1992 bars children under 14 years of age
 from "places of waged work" and from work that is "not suitable for that child's age,
 health, or physical ability" or that "might obstruct the education or adversely affect
 the mentality or behavior of the child. An earlier law prohibits government employ-
 ment of children under the age of 16. There are no reports of children being em-
 ployed in the small industrial sector, although children do work in family fishing,
 agricultural, and commercial activities.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-There is no national minimum wage for the
 rivate sector, although the Government has established wage floors for certain
 inds of work. There are no statutory provisions for hours of work and length of
 annual leave. Given the severe shortage of labor, however, employers must offer
 competitive pay and working conditions to attract skilled workers. In the public sec-
 tor, a 6-hour day and a 6-day workweek have been established through administra-
 tive circulars from the President's office. Overtime pay for those who work more
 than a 6-hour day was instituted in the public sector in 1990. Government workers
 receive 3 weeks' leave per year. There are no laws governing health and safety con-
 ditions.
