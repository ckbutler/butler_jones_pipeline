 ECUADOR
 Ecuador is a constitutional republic with a president and a
 72-member unicameral legislature chosen in free elections.
 Members of the Supreme Court, chosen by Congress, preside over
 a judiciary that is independent according to the Constitution
 but sometimes subject to political pressure. Fifteen
 registered political parties, a free press, and active human
 rights groups and labor unions are the mainstays of an open
 and lively political system. Ecuador's June 1990
 congressional election--the sixth since its return to
 democracy in 1979--saw significant losses by progovernment
 parties, leaving the Government without a majority in Congress.
 The Ecuadorian military, composed of an army, air force, and
 navy (with marine and coast guard units, has significant
 autonomy, reinforced by access  to revenues from its civil
 aviation and other- economic activities. Th-mf-litary's
 principal function is to provide for Ecuador-s security
 against foreign threats - Although its secondary role is- to
 assure internal security, the military-has maintained a low
 profile in domestic politics since the return to
 constitutional rule in 1979. The national police are
 responsible for domestic law enforcement and maintenance of
 internal order. They also have primary responsibility for
 carrying out counternarcotics efforts, although the military
 is increasing its role irthe war against drugs, In 1990
 there were numerous, credible allegations. of police
 mistreatment of suspects, including the use of physical force
 against detainees. The President controls the police through
 the Minister of Government, and the command structure of the
 national police is cmpletely separate- from the armed forces
 joint command,.
 Despite reduced inflation in 1990, overall economic conditions
 remained difficult. Rural poverty was extensive, and the
 combined nationwide underemployment and unemployment rate was
 about 60 percent. The economy is based on private enterprise,
 although there is heavy government involvement in key sectors
 such as petroleum, utilities, and aviation.
 Ecuadorians enjoy, both in law and in fact, a wide range of
 freedoms and individual rights, but human rights problems
 remain. Principal among these are torture and other
 mistreatment of prisoners and detainees, brutal prison
 conditions, lengthy detention without charge, a politicized
 court system, and pervasive discrimination against women,
 blacks, and Indians.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 While there were no known political killings in Ecuador in
 1990, there were also no arrests or convictions for political
 killings which occurred in previous years. Investigations by
 Congress and a respected human rights organization into the
 1985 death of Consuelo Benavides concluded that naval and
 police officers in Esmeraldas province were responsible for
 Benavides' death. The Government did not initiate legal
 proceedings,
 
 
 600
 ECUADOR
 however, and the civil suit brought by the Benavides family in
 1989 against navy officials was still in progress at the end
 of 1990.
 Similarly, the January 1988 disappearance of two Colombian
 citizens, teen-aged brothers named Restrepo, was not
 definitively or satisfactorily resolved. Reliable human
 rights activists and a team of Colombian police investigators
 believe that the two boys were picked up in Quito by National
 Police officials, brought to a police station for questioning
 and severely beaten, causing the death of one brother. The
 other brother reportedly was then killed deliberately. The
 Government sponsored three investigations, none of which fixed
 responsibility for their disappearances and presumed deaths.
 During a nationwide Indian demonstration in early June, one
 demonstrator, Oswaldo Cuvi Inga, was killed in Chimborazo
 province by a bullet through the chest. The government-
 initiated investigation of the case was continuing at year's
 end. Indigenous groups and human rights activists state that
 Cuvi was killed by police called in to remove demonstrators
 from a highway.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no known politically motivated disappearances in
 1990. Two earlier disappearances, the 1985 Benavides case and
 the 1988 Restrepo case described above, may well have been
 carried out by security forces, but no arrests have been made
 in either case.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Although torture and similar forms of intimidation and/or
 punishment are prohibited by law, reports of physical force
 used by police against suspects and prisoners (particularly
 against repeat offenders) are-persistent, widespread, and
 credible. Attorneys and human rights observers agree that the
 beatings of suspects are the most common tool used by police
 to carry out criminal investigations. While these sources
 believe that torture and physical intimidation are used to
 extract information from suspects because the police lack the
 knowledge and technology to carry out modern, scientific
 investigations, it should also be noted that officials are
 almost never punished for such abuses. Nearly every month the
 Ecuadorian Ecumenical Human Rights Commission (CEDHU)
 publishes detailed reports on suspects claiming to have been
 tortured by the police. CEDHU's reports frequently name
 police officials for the specific torture case and often
 include photographs of the victims with their wounds.
 Officials have generally not been held accountable for abuses
 because mistreatment is most often visited upon those lacking
 money or influence. The Latin American Human Rights
 Organization (ALDHU) is working with the National Police to
 institute an accountability system. These efforts are recent,
 however, and as of year's end, no significant improvements in
 accountability were noted.
 Female suspects are generally treated no worse than male
 -uspects, and sexual harassment or coercion against female
 .ispects does not appear to be commonly practiced.
 .r 1990 there were a number of credible and detailed reports
 -f torture of criminal suspects carried out by police. The
 
 
 601
 ECUADOR
 Restrepo brothers may well have been victims of torture by
 police, and a French citizen, Georges Aubrey, was tortured by
 police after being apprehended for cocaine possession while
 preparing to depart on an international flight.
 Prison conditions in Ecuador's 20 extremely crowded detention
 centers are abysmal. Human rights activists charge that these
 detention centers constitute a serious violation of individual
 rights. There are no separate facilities for hard-core or
 dangerous criminals.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 In practice, the legal protections against arbitrary arrest or
 detention are often violated. The Constitution, and penal code
 provide that no one may be deprived of liberty without a
 written order from a competent governmental authority, either
 a police chief ( a "comisario"Y or a judge of instruction ( an
 "intendente"). Specific written orders must be signed within
 24 hours of detention-even in cases in which a suspect is
 caught in the act of committing a crime. The suspect must be
 charged with a specific criminal offense within 4a hours of
 arrest. All prisoners have the right to a review of the
 legality of their detention, a review which is supposed to be
 carried out by the top-level elected official of the locality
 in which the suspect is held.
 The process of arrest normally begins with an accusation of a
 criminal act brought by one or more private citizens against
 another. The police often detain suspects without the
 required order. Suspects are frequently detained- longer than
 24 hours before orders are signed, and few are charged- with-in
 48 hours of arrest. Preventive detention before sentencing is
 legal under certain circumstances. Trial is supposed to begin
 within 15 to 60 days of the initial arrest (60 days is the
 maximum period a suspect charged with a specific crime is
 required to wait before the. trial cQmmences).  In practice,
 the initiation of the trial phase can take years- For
 example, of the 1,086 prisoners held in jail in September in
 the Ecuadorian capital of Quito, 763 were only under
 indictment and had not yet entered the formal trial stage.
 Many prisoners end up serving longer under indictment than the
 length of the sentence handed down after conviction. To avoid
 this long, arduous, and arbitrary process, families of
 detainees sometimes intervene in an illegal manner to secure
 the prisoner's freedom.
 In 1990 there were no arrests of citizens for holding views
 critical of the Government. Exile is not generally used as a
 tool of political control.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The vast majority of defendants are tried by the regular court
 system, although some indigenous groups try members privately
 for violations of tribal rules. The Congress elects a
 16-member Supreme Court which chooses its president from
 within its ranks. The Supreme Court names the approximately
 115 members of the provincial superior courts which serve as
 appeals courts for criminal, civil, tax, and labor cases. The
 executive branch names the other "first instance" judges.
 While the courts are supposed to be independent by law,
 political party leaders exercise significant influence over
 the selection of judges at all levels; most Ecuadorians
 
 
 ECUADOR
 perceive their court system as politicized. Discussions
 regarding reform of the high court are underway in the
 Congress. Minimum due process rights are provided for by law
 and are generally observed in practice. In theory, the
 accused is presumed to be innocent until proven guilty.
 Defendants have the -right to a public trial, defense
 attorneys, and appeal. They may present evidence but are not
 forced to testify if their testimony would be
 self-incriminating, or if it would incriminate immediate
 relatives. Defendants may confront and cross-examine
 witnesses. In theory, there is a public defender system. In
 practice, there are reportedly only four public defenders in
 Quito and none currently active in Guayaquil. There is some
 charity work by private lawyers and law students; although the
 practice is not widespread, and law students are not permitted
 to appear in court as legal representatives.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Police are required to have a warrant to enter a private home
 or business except in cases of hot pursuit. The police
 generally respect the sanctity of private homes and
 correspondence, although there were cases of illegal entry in
 past years. Police surveillance is permitted. Wiretapping is
 prohibited by the Constitution. No specific cases of illegal
 surveillance or entry were reported in 1990.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution provides for freedom of speech and
 communication, and this is generally respected in practice.
 However, in September the Government revoked the license of a
 Guayaquil radio station following unsubstantiated charges
 broadcast over that station that the President's brother was
 involved in corrupt activities. Local media representatives
 protested the Government's action as an infringement on
 freedom of the press. The Government cited the law on radio
 and television broadcasting to justify its action. This law
 states, among other things, that radio and television
 concessions may be terminated for transmissions that are
 injurious or contrary to accepted moral standards or based on
 supposition which could cause injury, damage, or social or
 political unrest. Most of the major media organs--television,
 newspapers, and radio-are in private hands. The Government
 sometimes requires television and radio to broadcast
 government-produced programs featuring the President and other
 top administration officials, and requires newspapers to carry
 a minimum amount of news prepared by the National Secretariat
 of Social Communication. The media and opposition political
 figures have criticized the Government's use of the media for
 its own political ends.
 The media represent a wide range of political views and
 frequently criticize the Government. However, some degree of
 self-censorship in the print media occurs, particularly with
 respect to stories about the military or corruption at high
 levels of national, provincial, or municipal government.
 There are 2 major dailies in the capital, Quito, 3 in the
 principal commercial center, Guayaquil, and more than 20
 additional papers published daily in other regions and cities.
 There are 4 national television networks and about 300 radio
 stations, as well as cable television programming from the
 
 
 603
 ECUADOR
 United States, Canada, Brazil, Chile, and Mexico, all free of
 government censorship.
 Ecuador has a large university system comprised of both
 state-subsidized and private universities. The state
 universities are active in politics, particularly on the left
 of the political spectrum. The Government has scrupulously
 avoided interference in issues involving academic freedom.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and.Association
 The Constitution provides for the rights of free assembly and
 association for peaceful'purposes. These rights are generally
 respected in- practice. Public- rallies require prior
 government approval, which is generally granted. Numerous
 political demonistrations- took place in 199-0, including student
 demonstrations against public transportation fare increases,
 the U.S. intervention in Panama, a general strike- on July 11,
 and a nationwide Indian protest demonstration in-June which
 lasted about r week. Generally, the security forces intervene
 in demonstrations only whe. there is violence against persons
 or property.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Citizens are free to practice the religion of their choice.
 There is no official state religion, although the population
 is nominally over 9-G percent Roman Catholic- There are active
 Protestant and Jewish communities in the malor cities and
 evanelIfcal movements continue to attract new adherents- The
 Constitution prohibits discriminatio- for religious reasons,
 although members of the clergy are barred by the Constitution
 from election to the Congress, presidency, or vice presidency.
 Numerous foreign-based religious orders are active and
 maintain generally good relations with the Government.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 The Constitution assures the right of all citizens to travel
 freely throughout the country, to choose their place of
 residence, and to depart from and reenter Ecuador. These
 rights are respected in practice. Exit visas are required to
 ensure that travelers have complied with tax and military
 obligations. There were no reports in 1990 of abuse of this
 system for political reasons. Ecuadorian citizens who return
 to the country after residing abroad are not harassed or
 discriminated against by the Government. No cases of forced
 resettlement were reported in 1990.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Since the return to civilian rule in 1979, Ecuadorian citizens
 have exercised their right to change their national and local
 governments. Free elections for the presidency took place in
 1979, 1984, and 1988 and are scheduled again for 1992. Each
 presidential contest resulted in a different party's victory
 and subsequent inauguration. Congressional elections have
 taken place regularly every 2 years since 1979, with the most
 recent contest having occurred in June 1990. The elected
 civilian governments exercise real authority. There has been
 a notable reduction over the past few years in the historic
 tendency of the military to interfere in politics.
 
 
 ECUADOR
 In 1990 the number of legally registered political parties
 increased to 15, up from 14 in 1989. The parties span the
 ideological spectrum. Eleven of the 15 parties, including 4
 of the leftist parties, won seats in the Congress.
 Voting is mandatory for literate citizens over the age of 18
 and voluntary for illiterate citizens. There are no
 restrictions on voting by women or by minority groups (blacks
 and Indians). Active-duty members of the military cannot
 vote, although some military leaders in mid-1990 suggested a
 proposal to eliminate this restriction. All citizens,
 regardless of sex, religion, socioeconomic status, or ethnic
 origin, have the right to form and join political parties and
 to run for local or national office. Ecuador is a traditional
 society with few legal protections against discrimination.
 Despite provisions in the Constitution against discrimination,
 the white/mestizo male-dominated elite tends to be
 self-perpetuating, and blacks, Indians and women continue to
 be underrepresented in high positions in Government and the
 private sector.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights.
 Domestic human rights groups such as CEDHU and the Latin
 American Human Rights Association (ALDHU,'headquartered in
 Quito) are independent and actively monitor all aspects of the
 Ecuadorian human rights scene. These groups, particularly
 CEDHU, have been outspoken in their criticism of the
 Government's record on specific cases, especially the Restrepo
 and Aubrey cases (see Sections l.a and l.c.). Following the
 Indian demonstrations and protests, the Borja administration,
 besides opening a dialog with the indigenous groups,
 cooperated during visits by international environmental and
 human rights groups. Although the Government expressed
 frustration with the activities of some of the groups
 interested in the environment-and the role of indigenous
 groups in protecting it, the Government has taken no action to
 block the investigative missions of these groups.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 The Constitution prohibits discrimination based on race,
 religion, sex, or social status. Nevertheless; de facto
 discrimination against women, blacks, and Indians is pervasive
 in Ecuadorian society, particularly with respect to
 educational and economic opportunity. The vast majority of
 the rural population of approximately 5 million (slightly less
 than 50 percent of the population) are peasants of Indian or
 Indian-mestizo ancestry. The population of the rural,
 northern coastal area of Ecuador includes large numbers of
 black citizens. Most peasants live in varying degrees of
 poverty. Land is scarce, infant mortality, malnutrition, and
 epidemic disease are common, and potable water and electricity
 are often unavailable. The rural education system is
 seriously deficient, even while the Government continues to
 heavily subsidize the state universities' largely white or
 white/mestizo students from the middle and upper classes.
 Rural-urban migration continues to increase. Two land reform
 programs were carried out in 1964 and 1972, but neither had a
 long-term positive impact on overall peasant living
 standards. The Borja administration carried out a "literacy
 campaign" with the help of Cuban and Sandinista advisers,
 
 
 605
 ECUADOR
 among others, but the program was criticized for being heavily
 politicized, and its overall impact on rural education was not
 significant.
 Efforts to improve living standards for Indian and black
 peasants was hampered in 1990, as in previous years, by the
 Government's reluctance to change traditional spending .
 patterns and policies which have favored the cities. The
 overall shortage of fiscal resources has also played a role.
 The long-simmering frustration of Ecuador's largest minority
 group, the Indians, over these- socioeconomic issues exploded
 in the nationwide protest demonstrations- of late May and early
 June. The protests were led by the umbrella indigenous
 organization, the National Confederation of Indian-
 Nationalities of Ecuador (CONAIE). The demonstrators took
 over a church, in downtown Quito, blocked traffic for several
 days along the Pan American highway, briefly detained some
 government officials, and seized land- CONAIE presented-a
 16-point manifesto to the Government demanding additional land
 and other socioeconomic programs for indigenous-geoups. One
 demonstrator was killed, and-security forces made arrests
 during the uprising. The Borja administration pursued a
 dialog wit- CONAIE to attempt to peacefully resolve the issues
 raised byrthe indigenous groups. As a result of these
 demonstrations, Ecuador became the .focus of increased
 attention from internationar human rights- environmentar, and
 indigenous groups, as well as from the international media.
 Some of these groups expressed concern about Ecuador's
 economic development policies-, which they believe impact
 negatively on the cultural traditions of the inaigenous
 population and ultimately on the fragile environment of the
 Amazon basin region of the country- The U.S.-based-Sierra
 Club legal defense fund filed a suit with the Inter-American
 Human Rights Commission alleging that the Ecuadorian
 Government's policies providing legal land title to Huaorani
 Indians will result in increased petroleum development
 activities on Huaorani lands.
 In 1990, the implementation of certain reforms to the civil
 code (changes approved in late 1989) and the election of five
 female members to the Congress (a net gain of two over the
 previous legislative session) suggested some improvement in
 the status of women in Ecuador. However, the Ecuadorian
 Women's Liberation Movement believes that in practice,
 "culture, ideology, tradition and myth" continued to inhibit
 achievement of full equality for women. While no current data
 on salaries or occupation by sex are available, anecdotal
 evidence suggests that the number of women in the- professions
 or working as skilled laborers is substantially less than men,
 and salary discrimination is common.
 Although violence against women, including within marriage, is
 prohibited by law, it is a common practice, according to human
 rights activists. Many rapes go unreported because of the
 victim's reluctance to confront the perpetrator. Police abuse
 of women during interrogation or detention appears to be no
 more common than police abuse of male suspects and prisoners.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Under the Constitution and Labor Code, most workers enjoy the
 right to form trade unions. Ecuador ratified the
 International Labor Organization's (ILO) Convention 87 on
 
 
 ECUADOR
 freedom of association as well as Convention 98 on the right
 to organize and collective bargaining. Workers not granted
 the freedom to form trade unions include public security and
 military officials, public sector employees in nonrevenue
 earning entities, and workers in establishments with 14 or
 fewer employees. The ILO's Committee of Experts on the
 Application of Conventions and Recommendations (ILO-COE)
 stated that the prohibition on establishment of trade unions
 by public servants in nonrevenue earning entities is
 incompatible with Ecuador's ratification of Convention 87.
 Approximately 12 to 15 percent of the work force is organized.
 There are four large labor centrals or confederations, three
 of which maintain strong international affiliation, although
 the Government barred labor representatives from two
 confederations from attending the 1990 ILO conference in
 Geneva. The Government stated that these two leaders had
 already attended previous ILO conferences. Ecuador also has
 numerous unaffiliated labor federations, such as the drivers
 union, the teachers' organization, the national artisans and
 mechanics confederation, and numerous peasant groups.
 Workers by law have the right to strike. There are few
 restrictions on this right, except for Workers in some
 state-owned enterprises involved in production of basic public
 services such as hospitals, petroleum, telephones, water, and
 electricity. A 10-day cooling-off period is required before
 declaring a strike. Many strikes occurred in Ecuador in 1990,
 most pf which were declared legal. In a legal strike, workers
 take possession of the factory or workplace, thus ending
 production at the site, and receive police protection during
 the takeover. All salaries and benefits continue to be paid
 by the employer during a legal strike. Public security forces
 were used in 1990 to clear illegal strikers out of the Public
 Works Ministry, the Social Welfare Ministry, and a telephone
 company installation. No physical injuries or property damage
 was reported during these incidents.
 There are currently no export processing zones in Ecuador,
 although the Government approved a maquila law (in-bond
 processing) in August. The maquila law will permit the hiring
 of temporary workers for the maquila industries only. While
 there is no express prohibition on association rights in the
 maquila law, organizing temporary contract workers will be
 difficult.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 Ecuador has a highly segmented labor market with a minority of
 workers in skilled, usually unionized, positions in state-run
 enterprises or in protected import substitution industries.
 The vast majority of the economically active population (some
 60 percent according to a recent, fairly reliable survey) is
 either unemployed or underemployed in the informal sector.
 Most rural labor is not organized. The Labor Code requires
 that all private employers with 15 or more workers belonging
 to a union must negotiate collectively when the union so
 requests. This broad right does not extend to most public
 sector employees in nonrevenue earning ministries, nor to
 management in certain entities with social or public
 objectives. The Labor Code prohibits discrimination against
 unions and requires that employers provide space for union
 activities upon the union's request. The ILO-COE, however,
 stated in June that the Labor Code inadequately protects
 against antiunion activity at the time of recruitment. The
 
 
 607
 ECUADOR
 Committee on Freedom of Association's review of a specific
 complaint involving antiunion discrimination was rendered moot
 when union strike leaders accepted compensation in lieu of job
 reinstatement.
 The Labor Code, which is highly unfavorable to employers, is a
 disincentive to the hiring of union members and to employment
 in general. Employers often try to avoid hiring additional
 workers and unionization by substituting machinery for workers
 or "atomizing" their production processes to maintain a plant
 employing less than 15 workers. Employers are not permitted
 to dismiss a worker without the express permission of the
 Ministry of Labor. Dismissals ruled as unjustified require
 payment to the worker of large indemnities or separation.
 payments'by employers. The Labor Code provides-for resolution
 of labor conflicts through an arbitration and conciliation
 board compr-Ised of'one representative of-the-Ministry of
 Labor, two- from the union, and two representatives of
 management. Participation in this process if voluntary- and
 strikes and lockouts occur even while arbitration is under way.
 The Ministry of- Labor has the, principal role iii enforcing
 labor law and carries this out with a corps of labor
 inspectors-who are active in all 21 provinces.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Compul-sory- labor is prohibited hy both the Constitution and
 the Labor Code and is not practiced.
 d- Mirnimum Age for Employment of Chirdren.
 Persons less than 14 years old are prohibited by law from
 working except in special circumstances such as
 apprenticeships. Those between the ages- of 14-18 are required
 to- have parental or guardian permission to work- in practice,
 these standard5 are not enforced. In rural areas most
 children leave school at about 1-0 years of age to-contribute
 to household income as farm laborers. In the city many
 children under age 14 work in fam ily-owned "businesses" fn the
 informal sector, shining shoes, collecting and recycling
 garbage, or peddling candy, gum, and other items. Enforcement
 of child labor laws is seriously inadequate.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 The Labor Code provides for a 40-hour workweek, a 15-day
 annual vacation, a minimum wage, and other variable
 - employer-provided benefits such as uniforms and training
 opportunities. The basic minimum wage of $36 per month is not
 adequate to provide a decent standard of living. The vast
 majority of organized workers in the state industries and
 formal sector private enterprises earn substantially more than
 the minimum wage and have significantly better benefits. The
 minimum wage is the operative wage in many informal sector
 activities. Employers are responsible for maintaining safe
 and clean working conditions. The Social Security Institute
 is responsible for ensuring such conditions and does so in the
 formal sector.
