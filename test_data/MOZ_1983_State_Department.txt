 MOZAMBIQUE
 Mozambique is a centralized one-party state which entered
 independence in 1975 with few administrative institutions
 other than those of the guerrilla movement which had been
 fighting Portuguese rule. The sole legal party, the Front
 for the Liberation of Mozambique, espouses a Marxist-Leninist
 ideology and claims that political decisions are made by
 consensus. In practice, policies and initiatives emanate
 from the Government/party hierarchy. Political participation
 by citizens at the national level is limited to accepting or
 rejecting candidates for the legislature selected by the party.
 The Government is currently battling an insurgency led by the
 Mozambique National Resistance which operates in nine of the
 country's ten provinces. The Government of the Republic of
 South Africa reportedly supports the resistance operations. In
 1983, South African Air Force planes attacked what South Africa
 claimed were houses of the African National Congress, a group
 which seeks the overthrow of the current South African.Govern-
 ment, in a suburb of the capital city of Maputo. The attack
 killed (according to Mozambican reports) seven people.
 The integrity of the individual is called for in the Consit-
 tution but is not always respected in practice. The exercise
 of extraordinary powers by military and state security agencies
 and a weak judicial system have led to instances of arbitrary
 arrest and imprisonment. Rural populations living in outlying
 areas have also been caught up in the guerrilla war, and reliable
 sources have reported serious human rights violations by both
 insurgents and government forces during the last year. The
 Government, faced with increasing economic and security problems,
 has instituted increasingly repressive measures to control the
 population. Public whippings were instituted in early 1983
 and the death penalty was authorized for *economic criminals."
 In the spring, at least seven suspected guerrillas were tried
 before large, hostile crowds, found guilty, and summarily
 executed. The already fragile judicial system was attacked by
 senior government officials and the country's only law faculty
 closed. In June, the Government began forcibly relocating tens
 of thousands of unemployed people in the cities to rural
 areas in the north.
 Mozambique is one of the world's poorest countries with a per
 capita gross national product of under $250. Eighty-five per-
 cent of the population is engaged in subsistence agriculture.
 A drought. in the southern part of the country, a shortage of
 trained personnel and equipment, disruptions and acts of
 sabotage carried out by anti-government insurgents, as well
 as the Government's economic policies-have hindered the
 country's development.
 On a more positive note, the Government has loosened its control
 of organized religion in the country and has increased support
 to the private sector in both agricultural and commercial
 production. Nevertheless, in part because of the widespread
 and serious nature of the internal civil violence in Mozambique,
 prospects for significant short-term improvements in the
 human rights situation are poor. In the long term, improve-
 ments are likely to depend on progress in overcoming the
 country's security and economic problems and greater commitment
 to human rights by the Mozambican leadership.

 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom From:
 a. Unlawful or Arbitrary Deprivation of Life
 The continuing war between government forces and the Mozambique
 National Resistance has led to the death of both Mozambican and
 foreign civilians. The insurgents have been brutally violent,
 killing, maiming, and kidnapping their targets, but government
 military actions have also contributed to civilian fatalities
 in contested areas. Precise figures are unavailable, but the
 total number killed is estimated to be in the hundreds. The
 insurgents have targeted, in particular, party and government
 officials and foreign workers for death and intimidation.
 It is widely reported that South Africa provides significant
 support to the insurgents.
 In May 1983, four South African aircraft bombed the Matola
 suburb of Maputo soon after an explosion set off in Pretoria
 allegedly by the African National Congress. The South
 Africans claimed that the purpose of their attack was to
 destroy the bases of anti-South African exiles in Matola, but
 an on-the-ground inspection indicated that only civilian
 targets had been hit. According to Mozambican reports, one
 South African member of the African National Congress and
 six Mozambicans were killed. The Matola attack was the
 second time in little more than two years that South African
 forces have attacked targets deep within Mozambique.
 In response to the insurgent attacks, the Government has insti-
 tuted increasingly repressive measures to control the population.
 On two occasions in January 1983, in the southern provinces of
 Maputo and Gaza, a total of seven Mozambicans accused of being
 resistance guerrillas were tried without due process before
 large, hostile crowds, found guilty, and summarily executed.
 The Government described these as military tribunals, which
 have the authority to mete out the death penalty, although the
 trials were directed by senior government officials who did
 not normally bear judicial responsibility. There have been
 unofficial but credible reports that other such public trials
 have also taken place in the central provinces of Inhambane
 and Zambezia.
 In 1983, the Government also extended the death penalty for
 those convicted of economic offenses. Two individuals were
 sentenced to death ex post facto under the new law and have
 been executed (one convicted of theft, the other of black
 marketeering). Several other individuals were sentenced to
 death by military tribunals which have closed proceedings
 and no provision for defense counsel.
 b. Disappearance
 Although the arbitrary nature of judicial and police activity
 has led to situations in which relatives and friends of detainees
 lose track of the prisoners, there are no report of government-
 sponsored disappearances. The insurgents have abducted
 Mozambicans and conscripted them into their movement. They
 also kidnap foreign workers on a regular basis. Most, but not
 all of these hostages eventually have been released unharmed or
 
 
 252
 freed by government troops. In August, insurgents attacked
 a mining complex in north-central Mozambique, killing two
 Soviet civilians, two Mozambicans, and abducting twenty-four
 other Soviet workers and several Mozambicans. As of late
 December 1983 there was no indication that the insurgents
 were planning to release the hostages they still held,
 although several had reportedly been freed by government
 troops and at least one of the Soviets reportedly had died
 in captivity.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 In 1983 the Government legalized public floggings for a wide
 range of crimes including black marketeering. The flogging
 is carried out with a staff and there have been several
 reported cases where permanent injury or death have resulted.
 Prisons are generally overcrowded and characterized by
 inadequate food, hygiene, and medical care. These conditions,
 however, appear to be a result of limited resources reflecting
 the low level of economic development in Mozambique, rather than
 an attempt to inflict further punishment on prisoners. Apart
 from its regular prisons, the Government has established "re-
 education centers" in remote parts of the country where
 political prisoners and other "anti-social elements" (e.g.,
 prostitutes, black marketeers, etc.) are interned. The
 Interior and Justice Ministries may send prisoners to
 these centers when their crimes are deemed "anti-social;"
 those handled by the Justice Ministry probably have had the
 benefit of at least minimum legal safeguards, but those sent
 by the Interior Ministry usually have not.
 The prisoners are often given sentences of indeterminate length.
 Conditions at the centers are harsh and prisoners must feed and
 shelter themselves. Reports by those journalists who have had
 the rare opportunity to visit the centers decribe extremely
 spartan living conditions, and there have been reports of
 capriciously cruel treatment by guards at isolated centers.
 The rural population has been victimized by both the insurgents
 and government troops. Cases of mutilations of civilians by
 guerrillas have been documented in several Mozambican provinces.
 There have been reliable reports of incidents in which govern-
 ment troops have brutalized and coerced local populations reluc-
 tant to return to communal villages. It is not known whether
 such actions by Mozambican troops have been directed or con-
 doned by the Government, nor whether the Government has taken
 any disciplinary action against those of its troops who may have
 been involved.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Arbitrary arrest and detention remain a problem in Mozambique.
 Preventive detention may be employed if officials believe a
 crime is probable or imminent. Although the concept of habeas
 corpus is acknowledged in Mozambican law, it is not always
 followed. Legally, a suspect can be held up to 90 days before
 charges are brought in serious cases and for shorter periods in
 lesser cases. This period is meant to be used for investigative
 purposes and may be extended only once for an additional 90 days
 if the State requires more time to prepare its case. In
 
 
 253
 practice, however, once charges are brought, prisoners sometimes
 linger in prison for months before they are brought to trial.
 Detainees may be released from prison prior to their trial but
 there is no well-defined system of bail.
 e. Denial of Pair Public Trial
 Partly because of the Portuguese influence, Mozambique employs
 an inquisitional, rather than adversary, system of justice.
 In cases which the court rules to be of insufficient
 significance, the accused are denied access to defense
 counsel. Public defenders are available in other cases.
 Judgment is rendered by the judge and two or four elected
 jurors. In so-called People's Tribunals in rural areas,
 individuals with only rudimentary education and legal
 knowledge are instructed to exercise common sense and
 application of general principles. Military tribunals try
 both civilian and military personnel in cases involving
 'crimes against the people and state security." In 1983
 this definition was expanded to include economic criminals
 such as black marketeers. Military tribunals operate in
 camera and are composed of military personnel, some of whom
 may have legal training. Right of appeal is recognized for
 non-military cases involving sentences of eight or more
 years and persons sentenced to death may appeal to the
 President of the Republic. The operation of the legal
 system remains fragile and observance of constitutional
 safeguards intermittent.
 The Government exerts strong influence over the judiciary.
 In March 1983, the President of Mozambique severely criticized
 the courts and the legal system. He questioned the usefulness
 of public defenders, arguing that they were more interested
 in winning a case than in uncovering the truth about a
 crime, and accused the judiciary of not serving the interests
 of the people. In response to these perceived shortcomings,
 the President ordered the law faculty at the country's only
 university closed. The law faculty remains closed.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 In 1983, the Government initiated "Operation Production' to force-
 ably remove the unemployed and other 'anti-social elements" from
 the cities. It is estimated that at least 30,000 - 35,000 people
 have been relocated since the program began in June, most of
 whom were placed in state-run agricultural projects in the north.
 Local party cadres decide what constitutes gainful employment
 and issue cards which attest to a person's right to reside in a
 city. The authorities search for the unemployed through spot
 checks on the streets and house-to-house checks. People are
 encouraged to inform, anonymously, on others who might fall
 under the "unproductive" category.
 Instances of capricious arrest and physical abuse related to
 'Operation Production" have been reported in the local press. The
 Government has acknowledged these abuses and tried to institute
 corrective measures. Minor officials have been reprimanded for
 abusing their authority during the implementation of the program.
 
 
 254
 Some people who had been illegally detained were released while
 others who could prove they had been wrongfully relocated were
 allowed to return to the cities. Precise numbers are unavail-
 able, but it appears that beneficiaries of these corrective
 measures were a small percentage of those originally detained.
 After its inception, Operation Production was expanded to assist
 the Government in collecting rents (almost all dwellings are
 owned by the State). House-to-house checks are performed by
 inspection brigades for this purpose. Those who have not paid
 their rent or who have not taken care of their dwellings to the
 satisfaction of the brigades, are evicted with only a few days
 notice.
 It is widely assumed that surveillance devices are employed in
 the telephone system. In 1983, the Government temporarily ban-
 ned outgoing international mail, claiming that too many people
 were sending goods that were scarce in Mozambique to friends and
 relatives abroad.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Public expression of views critical of or different from those
 espoused by the Government is not tolerated. Violators might be
 charged with libel, tribalism, racism, crimes against the people,
 espionage, or treason.
 The Government owns all authorized publications in the country
 as well as the radio and experimental television facilities.
 Although the media promotes the Government's general philosophy
 and its viewpoint on issues, there is reporting on abuses within
 the system or flaws in the implementation of government policies
 for those areas of state policy in which the Government itself
 has admitted to errors. Journalists are subject to pressures
 from the government-sanctioned Association of Journalists to
 which they belong. At least one reporter was jailed in the
 last year for writing a story of which the Government
 disapproved.
 Mozambique was a party to the Kadoma declaration of July 1983
 which banned the travel of South Africa-based journalists to the
 so-called *Front Line States." Some journalists based in South
 Africa continue to visit Mozambique and conduct interviews since
 the declaration was issued, however.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Except for religious organizations, the Government exerts tight
 controls over the right to form associations. In 1983, pro-
 duction councils, which operated at industrial and commercial
 enterprises, were transformed into what the Government describes
 as trade unions. The production councils were used to
 transmit government policies to the work force and, at least
 initially, it spears this will also be major function of the
 new trade unions. Mozambicans are not forced to join the
 ruling party, although membership is considered necessary
 for advancement in a professional career.
 
 
 255
 c. Freedom of Religion
 There is no state religion in Mozambique. Although the
 Constitution guarantees freedom of religion, the Government
 has in the past discouraged religious activities. It has
 reserved the right to decide whether individual church
 buildings could be operational and whether individual clergy
 could visit outlying areas, and has stated its intention
 eventually to nationalize church schools and hospitals.
 In the past year, the Government has relaxed some of these
 administrative restrictions over the religious community.
 The nationalization policy is not being actively implemented.
 The right of churches to operate and follow their rites and
 ceremonies has been affirmed and the Government has agreed
 to hear requests for reopening churches which closed during
 the uncertain period following independence. Government
 authorities have also granted the clergy greater access to
 outlying districts and parishes.
 However, the Government still closely monitors religious activi-
 ties, limits the number of dioceses in the country, and insists
 that the character of the religious groups be Mozambican and that
 they not act as representatives of external groups. Because of
 its criticism of the Government and assertion that it answers to
 the Vatican, the Roman Catholic Church has been singled out for
 criticism and is subjected to stricter controls than other reli-
 gions. The practice of traditional African religions is
 officially criticized and ridiculed but otherwise permitted.
 Critical comments of religious beliefs by the Government are
 almost always general in nature and not directed against
 specific individuals or church activities. On the level of
 the individual, membership in a religious group does not
 appear to affect, either favorably or unfavorably, a person's
 secular standing, and membership in the party is open to
 believers and non-believers.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel,
 Emigration, and Repatriation
 Travel and relocation within the country are controlled by securi-
 ty and employment requirements under the rationale of assuring
 public and social order. These controls have been tightened con-
 siderably since the inception of Operation Production. All
 Mozambicans are required to have with them at all times an
 identity card, work card, and residence permit. Mozambicans
 planning to travel outside their city of residence must obtain a
 travel permit from local government authorities.
 Temporary visits abroad are permitted. Mozambican law does not
 address the issue of emigration, but in some cases, would-be
 emigrants have been imprisoned or interned in reeducation
 camps.
 Several hundred thousand people fled from Mozambique at independ-
 dence, in 1975, because of economic chaos and fears of political
 persecution. In the last two years, thousands have fled, some
 only temporarily, to Zimbabwe and Malawi, because of the deteri-
 orating security situation created by the guerrilla war, and be-
 
 
 256
 cause of continuing economic hardship. In 1981 the Government
 announced a policy of welcoming back Mozambicans who had fled the
 country, and in 1982 it passed a law allowing for the reacquisi-
 tion of citizenship for Mozambicans who had left the country and
 assumed another nationality. Initially, some Mozambicans who had
 opposed the party before independence were jailed upon their
 return to the country. More recently, Mozambicans who have
 accepted the Government's invitation to return have apparently
 not suffered harassment or retribution. However, collaborators
 in the insurgency movement or outspoken critics of the
 Government generally have opted not to return to Mozambique. A
 bilateral repatriation agreement with Swaziland resulted in the
 forcible repatriation of 68 refugees to Mozambique in 1980.
 Since that time, the agreement has not been invoked.
 Mozambique is not a party to any international agreements on the
 status of refugees, but it has adhered to the spirit of these
 agreements. The Government has never been known forcibly to
 repatriate refugees to countries in which they fear persecution.
 Most refugees in Mozambique come from South Africa, Latin America,
 and Malawi. Despite Mozambique's weak economy, the Government
 has made a significant contribution to the welfare of these ref-
 ugees by providing land, housing, material, available social
 services, and, in some cases, employment. In addition, the
 country's acceptance of members of the South African group
 known as the African National Congress has made Mozambique
 a target of South African retaliation.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to
 Change Their Government
 Mozambique's only legal party, the Front for the Liberation of
 Mozambique, totally dominates political activity in the country.
 The party and the Government are controlled by a small cadre
 of senior officials. While structures for so-called mass poli-
 tical involvement exist at the provincial, district, and local
 levels, they do not allow for citizens to change, or even to
 influence significantly, their Government or its policies. While
 the party and Government espouse a system of "people's democracy'
 where decisions are made by consensus, in practice this means
 that policies and initiatives emanate from above. Election to
 representative bodies is made from a single slate and the
 population has the option only of endorsing or rejecting can-
 didates pre-selected by party structures. Votes by the National
 People's Assembly endorsing government policies are invariably
 unanimous. The number of ethnic Indian and white Mozambicans
 holding important positions is much greater than would be
 expected from their proportion in general population.
 However, this appears to be a reflection of the greater
 educational opportunities available to these groups prior to
 independence rather than to discrimination against black
 Mozambicans. Similarly, within the black population, all
 tribes are treated equally and tribal affiliation appears to
 have but a slight correlation to political outlook. For
 example, the area of anti-Government guerrilla activity
 appears to be dependent more on terrain and military objectives
 than on the tribal affiliation of the local populace.
 
 
 257
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Mozambique is a member of the United Nations Human Rights
 Commission. Amnesty International in 1983 was concerned about
 the long-term detention without trial of suspected opponents
 of the Government, including some reported detainees arrested
 before independence in 1975. The Freedom House organization
 describes Mozambique as "not free.' In December of 1983
 President Machel announced he was inviting the International
 Committee of the Red Cross and Amnesty International to investi-
 gate the conditions under which captured resistance combatants
 were being held and to recommend how these prisoners should
 be cared for.
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 Mozambique is one of the world's poorest countries with a per
 capita gross national product estimated at $232.5 in 1981. That
 figure probably dropped in 1983. The country has a population
 estimated at 13.047 million, 85 percent of which is engaged in
 subsistence agriculture. Because of a drought in the southern
 portion of the country, mismanagement of the state farms, and
 an economic system that offers few incentives to peasant
 farmers, food production has fallen far short of domestic
 requirements. In order to feed its population, the country.
 has had to spend a significant amount of its meager foreign
 exchange earnings on food imports and rely on very sizeable
 food aid grants from abroad. Considerable foreign food aid
 will be required in the coming year. In 1977, calorie supply
 available for consumption was estimated to be at 77.46 percent
 of nutritional requirements. If the drought persists, the
 problem could become desperate. Despite the food shortage,
 the Government does not actively support any population
 control programs. The population growth rate was 2.8 per cent
 in 1983.
 The industrial sector also faces severe problems. Produc-
 tivity has suffered from shortages of raw materials,
 equipment, spare parts, and trained personnel. A lack of
 foreign exchange has prevented the country from easing the
 shortages through imports. As a result, most factories
 operate at less than 50 percent capacity, and even companies
 that produce products for export have work stoppages.
 The Government has adopted a socialist economic system and
 governmental enterprises dominate all sectors of the economy.
 Individuals are allowed to operate small businesses, but the
 right to own property is restricted. In 1983 the Government
 indicted publicly that small private farming should be
 encouraged. Mozambique continues to try to attract foreign
 investment. In 1983, the Exxon and Shell companies signed
 an oil and gas exploration agreement with Mozambique. For the
 first time, the Government is seriously considering establish-
 ing an investment code.
 In the past, the Government has concentrated the supply of the
 few consumer goods available in the cities. Now, in an attempt
 to motivate peasant farmers and stimulate agricultural pro-
 duction, it has begun to reroute some of these items to rural
 areas.
 
 
 258
 In public health and education, differences in the quality of
 services available to rural and urban populations still exist.
 Medical care is significantly better in metropolitan areas.
 For example, the infant mortality rate now averages 114.9 per
 1,000 nationwide but varies from a low of 35-40 per 1,000 in
 sections of the capital to a high of 190-200 per thousand in
 some rural areas. Currently, life expectancy at birth is
 47.08 years but, again, there are wide differences between
 different parts of the country.
 The Government has continued its fairly successful inoculation
 campaign, aimed primarily at vaccinating children. Because so
 many of them are malnourished, children are particulary suscep-
 tible to disease (measles is a major killer), and as many as
 40 percent of all deaths in the country occur among children
 under the age of five. Probably fewer than ten percent of the
 population has access to safe water supplies and, even in large
 cities, outbreaks of cholera occur regularly.
 In 1983 the Government launched a campaign to establish what it
 called a national system of education. The program was meant
 to improve the quality of instruction and standardize school
 curriculums. Because of limited resources, the program has not
 been as successful as the Government had hoped. Nevertheless,
 education continues to be a priority for Mozambique. The
 Government has emphasized teacher training programs, particu-
 larly in rural areas. Most of these centers, however, lack
 adequate facilities and are oversubscribed and understaffed. As
 a result, the number of teachers in rural areas continues to
 increase but the quality of instruction remains low. "
 The World Bank estimates that the primary school enrollment
 ratio was 107 (125 for males, 90 for females) in 1979. Even
 taking into account that these figures include adults
 enrolled in primary school, they would appear to be much too
 high. A more realistic estimate would be a ratio of 50 to
 60 for both males and females. Furthermore, even the lower
 figure can be misleading because of the poor quality of the
 schools. Similarly, the World Bank estimates the literacy
 rate at 27.5 percent. Although the literacy rate has risen
 as a result of government programs, a rate of 20 percent
 (including those who are only semi-literate) would probably
 be more accurate.
 Other than the inequalities between rural and urban areas, the
 Government attempts to apportion social serices more or less
 equally among the population, without regard to race, religion,
 sex, or ethnic background.
