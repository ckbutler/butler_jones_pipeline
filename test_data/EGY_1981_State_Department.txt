 EGYPT
 Egypt is a republic with a strong presidency and central
 government, as well as an evolving multiparty political
 structure. President Sadat's efforts, begun in the early
 1970s, to liberalize the political, economic and social
 spheres of Egyptian life were largely maintained through
 the first eight months of 1981. During   this time, the
 status of human rights and their observance in Egypt re-
 mained consistent with the situation described in last
 year's   country report. While the Egyptian leadership
 tended to react with heightened sensitivity to opposition
 criticism of various aspects of the government's domestic
 and foreign policies, the measures taken by the government
 remained within the bounds of constitutional and' other
 legal safeguards established for the protection of civil
 and political liberties in Egypt.
 In September, following a summer of heightened sectarian
 tension between Muslims and Christians, the government em-
 barked on a major crackdown against persons suspected of
 fomenting religious extremism and strife. Subsequently,
 President Sadat's assassination at the hands of Muslim
 religious fanatics on October 6 prompted the declaration
 of a nationwide state of emergency for a period of up to
 one year. While the state of emergency is in force, it is
 expected that certain constitutional and legal safeguards
 normally associated with the protection of civil and polit-
 ical liberties in Egypt will remain suspended. President
 Mubarak has committed himself publicly to abrogate the
 state of emergency at the earliest feasible opportunity.
 In the economic sphere, despite continuing poverty, the
 poorest people have been insulated to a degree from infla-
 tion by the government's heavy subsidization of basic food
 commodities, as well as its efforts to guarantee affordable
 basic goods and services.
 1.   Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 Torture is forbidden by article 42 of the Egyptian consti-
 tution and by law. Citizens who allege that they have been
 tortured have the right to redress in the courts; informa-
 tion gained through torture or mistreatment cannot be used
 against the individual. Two allegations of torture came to
 public attention in 1981. The Kuwaiti newspaper, "Al-Watan,"
 cited three instances of alleged mistreatment of Egyptian
 and foreign detainees in Cairo's Citadel prison early in
 1981. The Egyptian attorney general, in a statement pub-
 lished on June 29, refuted these charges, noting that the
 defendants' claims of torture in each case had been invest-
 igated by the public prosecutor and reputable medical
 examiners, and that they had not been substantiated. At
 
 (N6)
 
 
 957
 the opening session in November of the trial of 24 persons
 implicated in the assassination of President Sadat, three of
 the accused alleged that they too had been tortured by the
 authorities. The court took these charges under advisement
 and ordered a complete investigation by the appropriate legal
 and medical authorities to determine their veracity.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 The Egyptian constitution and laws prohibit these forms of
 punishment. In August, it was publicly alleged that the
 Egyptian poet Ahmad Puad Negm, who reportedly had gone on
 a hunger strike in protest against alleged mistreatment
 by prison authorities while serving a one-year sentence at
 hard labor for jumping bail on a charge of incitement to
 riot. Egyptian Government sources maintained that Negm was
 not on a hunger strike and that he had not complained to
 the authorities of harsh treatment. Negm has been adopted
 by Amnesty International as a prisoner of conscience. One
 of the secular politicians arrested in September died in
 detention; however, this appears to have been due to
 natural causes rather than to mistreatment.
 c. Disappearances
 There were no known cases of secret arrests or clandestine
 detention by security authorities in the first eight months
 of 1981. Names of all persons arrested in the September
 crackdown were eventually published; however, complete
 details on the arrests and detentions carried out by the
 authorities since the state of emergency was declared on
 October 6 had not been made public as the year ended.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 Arbitrary arrest and imprisonment are forbidden by law.
 Under normal circumstances, arrests are made after lengthy
 investigations, and arrested persons are charged with
 violations of specific, existing laws. Preventive deten-
 tion is not normally practiced. Arrested persons enjoy
 the right of habeas corpus.
 In the summer, there were several serious incidents of
 fighting between Muslims and Copts, with both sides
 apparently led by religious extremist elements. Follow-
 ing these incidents, which took at least 14 lives, many
 Egyptians, inside and outside the government, expressed
 concern that the large scale violence experienced in Iran
 and Lebanon could be repeated in Egypt unless the forces
 of sectarian fanaticism were curbed. In early September
 President Sadat began a broad crackdown against religious
 extremists and also against secular oppositionists said
 to be associated with those extremists. In his speech on
 September 5, the president issued a "declaration of war"
 on radical Islamic fundamentalism and explained to the
 public the dangers he perceived from that ideology.
 Within a short time, almost 1,600 religious and secular
 
 
 958
 figures, including both Muslims and Christians, were
 detained by the authorities on charges of fomenting and
 exacerbating religious sectarian strife or otherwise endan-
 gering public order. The arrests were carried out in
 accordance with Egyptian law. The identities of persons
 detained in September were made public, and many reportedly
 have been accorded access to legal counsel. Details of
 official investigations into the activities of certain
 detainees have regularly appeared, along with reports of
 various indictments, in the Egyptian press. President
 Mubarak has promised to speed these investigations in order
 to provide for the early release of persons found to be
 innocent of wrongdoing. By the second week in January, 1982,
 87 of the September detainees including about sixty prominent
 secular politicians and journalists as well as both Muslim
 and Coptic religious figures had been released, with indica-
 tions that this trend would continue in subsequent weeks.
 Under the terms of the state of emergency imposed by interim
 presidential decree on October 6 and approved (in accordance
 with article 148 of the Egyptian constitution) by the peoples
 assembly on October 7, the president of the republic and his
 authorized representatives (e.g., the minister of interior)
 are empowered to order the arrest or detention of persons
 known to be, or suspected of being, dangerous to the preser-
 vation of public order and security, without regard for
 existing legal procedures. Over 2,500 persons, including
 the persons suspected of Sadat's murder and others believed
 responsible for related violent disturbances in Asyut and
 Cairo, were detained under such charges under this state of
 emergency.
 Amnesty International's 1981 report cited arrest, detention
 and imprisonment for the nonviolent expression of political
 beliefs as its principal concern regarding Egypt.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Egyptian law guarantees public trial and equal treatment be-
 for the law. Persons accused of espionage or crimes against
 state security, however, are tried before special state
 security courts in proceedings that are often closed to the
 public. The law governing states of emergency (No. 162 of
 1958) was recently amended to accord a person detained under
 a state of emergency the right to appeal his or her deten-
 tion to the president of the republic after six months
 have elapsed since the beginning of such detention. Should
 this appeal be rejected, the person reportedly has the right
 to renew his/her appeal six months from the date of the
 previous appeal.
 The 24 persons accused of direct involvement in the assassi-
 nation of President Sadat were put on trial in late November.
 The first two sessions of this trial were open to the public,
 with subsequent sessions held in camera. The trials of other
 
 
 959
 persons arrested since September had not yet been scheduled
 by the end of the year, as investigations into their alleged
 activities were stillin progress.
 f. Invasion of the Home
 Freedom from arbitrary invasion of the-home is guaranteed
 by the Egyptian constitution (article 44). Under normal
 circumstances, police must obtain a warrant for arrest,
 -search or seizure from the attorney general before taking
 such actions. The warrant, however, need not specify the
 material being sought during a search. The police can
 seize material during such a search and present it as
 evidence during trials. The courts have at times dismissed
 cases when they considered that warrants were issued with-
 out sufficient cause. Government officials who violate
 this law can be subjected to criminal penalties. Under
 the current state of emergency, the president of the
 republic and his authorized representatives are empowered
 to authorize the search of individuals or premises without
 regard for existing legal procedures, as well as to requi-
 sition buildings, sequester commercial establishments and
 impose curfews.
 2.   Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 The constitution guarantees freedom of speech, press, reli-
 gion and assembly. Although the government does not directly
 .control the'prfnt-media (as it does-radio and television),
 it exercises major influence on the press. It appoints and
 can dismiss all editors of government-owned publications,
 which include all major daily newspapers. Under provisions
 of law, the Shura (consultative) council has responsibility
 for supervision of the press through its ownership of 51
 percent.'of all non-party newspapers-and magazines.
 Constraints on editorial freedom are generally self-imposed
 by journalists-rather than produced through out-right cen-
 sorship. All journals,'whether partisan or publicly owned,
 are expected to reflect the "national interest" or "national
 consensus" in choosing what to publish. Nevertheless, in
 1981,-opposition journals on both the left and right pub-
 lished increasingly strong criticism of government policies
 prior to President Sadat's crackdown on religious extremists
 and secular oppositionists in early September. Seven reli-
 gious -and secular publications--including the Socialist
 Labor Party organ, "Al-Shaab""-were permanently banned in
 the course of that crackdown, under a 1978 law that
 empowers the-authorities to take such action against pub-
 lications that are considered to have'violated the national
 interest. Although, under the current state of emergency,
 the government also has the power to impose censorship, to
 seize printed materials and to suspend publications, it
 has not employed such measures to date. In fact, since
 Nubarak became president, restrictions on the press and the
 
 
 960
 electronic media appear to have been considerably loosened.
 Several noted journalists who were critical of President
 Sadat's policies have been allowed to write again in dailies.
 In addition, a noticeable loosening of inhibitions regarding
 controversial public discourse seems to have affected Egyptian
 television. Several free-ranging talk shows dealing with
 national and international issues can now be seen on TV (none
 existed prior to November), and persons interviewed in con-
 nection with such programs appear more outspoken than in the
 past.
 According to the constitution, Egypt is an Islamic state
 which guarantees freedom of religious expression. In the
 aftermath of last summer's serious intercommunal disturbances,
 about 40 prominent Muslim and Coptic religious personalities
 were arrested on charges of fomenting or exacerbating such
 strife. In addition, the government withdrew its recognition
 of the Coptic Patriarch, Pope Shanudah III, as his community's
 official representative and liaison in dealings with the
 government and appointed a papal committee composed of five
 leading Coptic bishops to exercise his functions in that
 regard. As 1981 ended, Pope Shanudah remained in enforced
 seclusion at the Coptic monastery at Wadi Natrun. While
 there are instances of individual discrimination against
 Copts on the part of Egypt's Muslim majority, there is no
 evidence of officially inspired or sanctioned acts of dis-
 crimination against the Copts or other religious minorities.
 The large Coptic minority continues to participate fully in
 the life of the country.
 Under powers granted to them during the current state of
 emergency, the authorities have placed limitations on the
 right of assembly. Although the primary intent of such
 limitations, which affect gatherings and marches, appears
 to be to control Islamic fundamentalist gatherings, the
 limitations, are general in their applicability.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration and Repatriation
 Freedom of movement within Egypt is guaranteed, except for
 travel in well-defined military districts. Except for limi-
 tations affecting male Egyptians who have not completed com-
 pulsory military service, freedom of travel and emigration
 are guaranteed. Egypt has a liberal policy on political
 asylum, and the extradition of political refugees is pro-
 hibited by law.
 Under the current state of emergency, the president of the
 republic and his authorized representatives are empowered
 to restrict foreign or domestic travel. Except in connec-
 tion with the violent disturbances provoked by Muslim extrem-
 ists at Asyut on October 8-11 (when the city was sealed off
 by the security forces), this power has not been invoked.
 
 
 961
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Political parties and organizations are permitted under
 licensing arrangements set forth in pertinent legislation.
 such legislation prohibits the formation of parties on
 religious or class lines, thereby making it illegal for
 communist'or Islamic societies to organize themselves as
 political parties. The people's assembly has 392 members,
 of whom 382 are elected. Ten members are appointed by
 the president. Thirty of the elected seats are reserved for
 women. President Mubarak's National Democratic Party (NDP)
 controls the peoples assembly, with over 300 seats. There
 are three legally constituted opposition parties: the
 Socialist Labor Party (SLP), the Liberal Party (LP), and
 the National Progressive Unionist Grouping (NPUG). The
 first two parties won 12 and 2 seats respectively, in the
 people's assembly in the last (June 1979) elections the
 NPUG entered candidates but did not win any seats.
 The second house of the legislative branch, the Shura
 (consultative) council, has 210 members, 140 of whom are
 elected under a system in which the party winning an
 electoral majority takes all elected seats in the second
 house. The Shura Council's functions are largely advisory
 (as opposed to legislative) in nature.
 Thirty alleged communists and leftist militants, arraigned
 in 1980 on charges of violating the law governing the forma-
 tion of political parties and of conspiring to overthrow the
 government, have been awaiting legal disposition of their
 cases since January, 1981 when their trials before the state
 security court were recessed. Resumption of these proceed-
 ings was postponed on at least two occasions during 1981.
 Three of the accused were released in November after the
 court determined there was insufficient evidence to try
 their cases.
 Egypt's special ethics court, established under a con-
 troversial 1980 law enacted to combat crimes against
 *social values," has handed down a decision on the cases
 of 19 exiled opposition figures. Because of their opposi-
 tion activities, they were accused of "making defeatist
 propaganda against the country" and of "violating the law
 on national peace and unity.' Six were also accused of
 plotting to overthrow the government. Five of the nineteen
 were acquitted. The remaining fourteen were found guilty
 in absentia and have been banned from political activity.
 Among them was former chief of staff Lt. Gen. Saad Shazli,
 who heads the Egyptian National Front. He has applauded
 the murder of President Sadat and called for the violent
 overthrow of the Mubarak government. The proporty of
 three of the fourteen, including Shazli, was sequestered
 by order of the court. The convictions are under appeal.
 
 
 962
 About 40 opposition political figures (many of whom have
 since been released) were included among the 1,600 persons
 arrested in the September crackdown; however, the legal
 right of opposition political parties to organize and operate
 (see above) was not affected. This situation has not been
 altered under the state of emergency declared on October 6.
 Women enjoy relatively high status in Egypt. They vote, may
 volunteer for non-combat duty in the armed forces, engage in
 economic activities outside the home, and exercise other
 rights of citizenship. Women are well represented in medi-
 cine, law and education, and serve at the under secretary
 level in various branches of government. The late President
 Sadat supported implementation of a 1979 decree revising
 the personal status law for the Muslim community 'to give
 women important rights in the areas of child custody, di-
 vorce and child support. Practical effects of this decree
 have yet to be manifested, however. Moreover, women
 still suffer some discrimination, particularly in rural
 areas and within more traditional communities.
 Egypt's organized trade union movement has approximately
 2.5 million members. Independence and freedom of action
 of labor unions have increased modestly in recent years.
 Several trade unions have taken the initiative to broaden
 their international labor links by affiliating with inter-
 national trade secretariats, notwithstanding the govern-
 ment's policy of discouraging such ties, in keeping with
 Egypt's traditional policies of non-alignment. Most
 industry in Egypt is at least partially government-owned.
 Trade union influence within the government has helped
 union leaders negotiate with these industries, as well as
 influence labor and economic legislation in the people's
 assembly. The government, in turn, exercises considerable
 influence in identifying candidates for positions of lead-
 ership within the labor movement. Final selection of such
 leaders is determined by democratic elections. Workers do
 not enjoy the right to strike, but occasional wildcat
 strikes have occurred in recent years.
 Professional associations in Egypt (e.g., the journalists
 union, engineers syndicate, bar association) operate under
 enabling legislation enacted by the people's assembly, as
 well as their own by-laws. When the government moved last
 July to replace the bar association's leadership, on grounds
 that its conduct had "deviated from the national interest"
 and "overstepped the bounds of responsible opposition" to
 President Sadat's policies, the government acted in accord-
 ance with the law and with the approval of the people's
 assembly; however, there was considerable public criticism.
 
 
 963
 3.   Government Attitude and Record Regarding International
 and Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The government maintains an official policy of responsive-
 ness to queries from international groups about human
 rights concerns in Egypt, including requests for visits in
 that regard. Official and non-official delegations partici-
 pate in international meetings on human rights. Egyptian
 human rights groups exist in Cairo and in other large urban
 areas. Their activities are essentially non-political,
 being related primarily to the welfare of prisoners and to
 women's rights. The government apparently does not inter-
 fere with their operations.
 4.   Economic and Social Circumstances
 The Mubarak government has indicated that economic concerns
 will have priority and is expected to continue to emphasize
 the themes and policies stressed by President Sadat in
 May 1980 when he focused on the concerns of Egypt's poorer
 classes who are least capable of coping with inflation.
 The government's near-term objective has been to raise the
 standard of living of low-income groups through higher
 wages, controlled prices and subsidized basic commodities.
 Direct subsidization of seven basic commodities (wheat,
 flour, sugar, rice, tea, edible oil and butane gas) is
 designed to provide ample supplies of essential commodities
 at affordable prices to lower income groups. As one re-
 flection of this policy, caloric intake for the average
 Egyptian exceeds nutritional requirements. The estimated
 cost to the government of these direct commodity subsidies
 is estimated at $3 billion, or 13 percent of projected gross
 domestic product. *In addition to the direct budget subsidies,
 hidden subsidies also exist throughout the economy--e.g.,
 cheap domestic energy prices which are estimated to cost the
 economy an additional $3.2 billion.
 The government continues to emphasize efforts to deal with
 Egypt's housing problem, which are compounded by a population
 growth rate of 2.9 percent (or one million Egyptians every
 nine months). Egypt's construction sector has not kept pace
 with demand, especially for low-cost housing. Housing and
 food security are identified-as Egypt's top two investment
 priorities. Education and health services are free and
 available to the majority of Egyptians.
 Since 1952, the government has made an effort to spread the
 benefits of economic growth and social programs more equit-
 ably throughout the economy. Health programs have reduced
 infant mortality from 116 to 85 per thousand in the last ten
 years, and raised life expectancy to nearly 57 years. The
 adult literacy rate has reached 43.5 percent. Public sector
 and government employment policies virtually guarantee jobs
 for everyone. Egypt enforces strict laws limiting the size
 
 
 964
 of land holdings to attempt to guarantee that both income
 and production opportunities are equitable in rural areas.
 Despite these policies, while Egypt's per capita income is
 rising steadily, it remains low ($600 in 1980/81 and $670
 targeted in 1981/82), and nearly 25 percent of the popula-
 tion remains below the poverty level.
 Despite the dominant role of the public sector in the
 economy, the Egyptian government remains committed to
 efforts to liberalize the economy and encourage the
 growth of the private sector (the so-called open door
 policy). Foreign and private participation in Egyptian
 economic development are expected to become increasingly
 important in achieving overall planning goals. Egypt's
 economy has experienced sustained real growth of aproxi-
 mately 8 percent per year since 1975. A large percentage
 of the increased revenues flowing to the government in
 the last few years is being spent on programs to help
 lower income classes. Increasing efforts in 1980 and 1981
 responded to widespread concerns that inflation had ser-
 iously eroded the purchasing power of the average Egyptian
 and that the benefits of economic growth were not reaching
 the poorer people. The government continues to attempt to
 ensure that the lower classes are insulated from inflation
 and that basic commodities and services are available at
 stable prices. As a result, the cost of subsidies has
 risen rapidly while needed fiscal and budgetary reforms to
 attack basic economic distortions in the economy have been
 deferred.
