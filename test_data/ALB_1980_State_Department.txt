 ALBANIA
 Albania is an isolated Balkan nation of about 2.6 million
 people. It is governed by a Communist regime which seized
 power at the close of World War II and has ruled without
 interruption since then. Albania is a member of the United
 Nations, but it has not signed the Final Act of the Con-
 ference on Security and Cooperation in Europe or the 1966 UN
 covenants on human rights.
 The ruling Albanian Workers' Party and the government main-
 tain stern controls over the Albanian people and carefully
 restrict the exercise of political and civil rights. There
 is substantial evidence, corroborated by private interna-
 tional organizations, of significant and continuing human
 rights violations in Albania.
 The United States government does not have relations of any
 kind with Albania and has not had any official representa-
 tives in that country since 1946. It is therefore not able
 to report or comment authoritatively or comprehensively on
 actual conditions within Albania.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a.   Torture
 Torture is reportedly practiced in Albania, specifically of
 persons accused-of anti-state and religious activities.
 b.   Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 Reports have been received of summary executions as well as
 the continued imprisonment of persons for "anti-state
 activity," "dissemination of religious propaganda," and
 "opposition to the state's anti-religious campaign." These
 reports have not been verified. Amnesty International has
 received reports claiming that prisoners in pre-trial con-
 finement have been held alone in windowless cells for up to
 six months. Under the present penal code, Albanian courts
 may impose the death penalty for a number of political
 offenses including agitation and propaganda against the
 state (Article 55); incitement of hatred or quarrels between
 nationalities and races (Article 56); creation of a counter-
 revolutionary organization or participation therein (Article
 57); activity against the revolutionary movement of the
 working class (Article 60); and refusal to carry out a duty
 and coercing others to refuse (Article 144).
 c.   Disappearances
 The information available on disappearances is insufficient
 for meaningful comment.
 d.   Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 There is not sufficient information available on the prac-
 tice of arbitrary arrest or imprisonment in Albania for
 comment.
 
 
 726
 e.   Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The Albanian judiciary includes a Supreme Court and regional
 and district courts. The courts are nominally independent,
 but they and the administration of justice are controlled by
 the ruling party.
 f.   Invasion of the Home
 The information available on the extent to which the Alba-
 nian authorities respect the constitutionally guaranteed
 inviolability of the home is not sufficient for substantive
 comment.
 2. Government   Policies Relating to the Fulfillment of
 Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care and Education
 Albania is a poor country with limited natural resources and
 the lowest amount of arable land per capita in Europe. Per
 capita GNP is estimated to be about $500, but accurate eco-
 nomic data are not available. There are no indications of
 chronic shortages or food rationing. Rents on residential
 housing are fairly low, but there are reportedly housing
 shortages, especially for newly-married couples.
 Albania has taken some significant steps toward industrial
 development, but it remains largely dependent on agriculture
 and the production of raw materials. All land belongs to
 the state and individual citizens are permitted to own only
 limited amounts of personal property.
 Albania is a party to the International Convention on the
 Political Rights of Women and to the Convention on the
 Nationality of Married Women.   The Albanian constitution
 asserts that women enjoy equal rights with men in work, pay,
 recreation, social security, education, socio-political
 activity, and in the family. To what extent these provi-
 sions are carried out in practice is difficult to ascer-
 tain. There have been advances, however, and the present
 Albanian woman is freer and more involved in aspects of the
 life of the country than was her mother. In 1975, repor-
 tedly 35% of all students were women. Women participate
 equally in the obligatory labor and military service prog-
 rams. There are few women in positions of leadership in the
 economic apparatus, however.
 3. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a.   Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 The leaders of the Albanian Communist Workers Party have
 imposed stern and uncompromising control over the Albanian
 people and rigid restrictions on the exercise of individual
 political and civil liberties. The Albanian constitution
 states that citizens "enjoy freedom of speech, press,
 organization, association, assembly, and public manifesta-
 tion." It prohibits discrimination, makes special mention
 of equal rights for women, and proclaims the inviolability
 of the home. It also provides, however, that "the rights of
 citizens are indivisible from the fulfillment of their
 duties and cannot be exercised in opposition to the
 socialist order." From the evidence available, few if any
 
 
 727
 of these constitutional rights are respected by the govern-
 ment.
 The Party and the government attempt to control all aspects
 of life in Albania and reprisals are reportedly swift and
 severe for those who deviate. Persons found listening to
 foreign radio broadcasts or exhibiting "alien manifesta-
 tions" are reprimanded and/or punished. Information from at
 home and abroad is carefully controlled, and Albanian citi-
 zens may receive mail from other countries on an extremely
 limited basis. The Albanian Worker's Party controls the
 government. No other parties are permitted to exist.
 All religious activity in Albania is expressly prohibited by
 the constitution and by government policy. In 1967 the
 government abrogated all laws dealing with church-state
 relations and began a campaign to eliminate all vestiges of
 religion. More than 2,000 mosques, churches, monasteries,
 and other religious institutions were closed, all religious
 literature was banned, and a number of church leaders were
 imprisoned or executed. The regime continues to suppress
 religious activity by imposing harsh penalties on persons
 who engage in religious practices, by conducting an educa-
 tional campaign against religion, and by obliging citizens
 to expose believers. In spite of these pressures, some
 Albanians reportedly continue to practice religion secretly
 in the privacy of their homes.
 b.   Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration and Repatriation
 Movement within the country and travel abroad are controlled
 very strictly, and transgressors may be severely punished.
 Under Article 47K of the Penal Code, "flight from the state
 and refusal to return to the fatherland on the part of a
 person sent on service or allowed to leave the state is
 punishable by imprisonment for not less than 10 years or by
 death." Under these circumstances only a handful of persons
 manage to leave Albania each year.
 c.   Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 The Albanian constitution provides for the exercise of state
 power and the direction and control of all other state
 organs by the People's Assembly and by people's councils.
 The members of these bodies are selected by the Party and
 then "elected" by universal suffrage.
 Article 42 of the constitution states that national minori-
 ties are "guaranteed protection and development of their
 culture and popular traditions, the use of their mother
 tongue and its teaching in the schools, and equal develop-
 ment in all fields of social life." There have been
 reports, however, that the Albanian government discriminates
 against the ethnic Greek minority of about 300,000 in
 southern Albania. Women have the right to vote, but there
 are few women in positions of leadership in the Party or
 state organizations.
 4. Government Attitude and Record Regarding International
 and Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 
 
 728
 The Albanian government has not cooperated with any
 inquiries regarding allegations of human rights violations
 and does not respond to or even acknowledge most communi-
 cations from abroad.
