 MALAWI
 The President of Malawi, Dr. H. Kamuzu Banda, has maintained
 nearly undisputed control over political life and government
 since he led the country to independence in 1964. He was
 proclaimed "Life President" in 1970. Political activity is
 limited to participation in the sole legal party, the Malawi
 Congress Party. Parliamentary elections, which are required
 at least every 5 years, were last held in 1987. Only
 candidates selected by the party and approved by the President
 are allowed to run. Almost all constituencies were contested
 in the last elections and nearly half of the incumbents were
 not reelected. Constitutional amendments and laws passed by
 the Parliament generally reflect decisions already taken by
 the President and his-close advisors.
 Military, police, and party security organs closely monitor a
 wide range of activities, particularly opposition to the
 Government. The small, highly professional Malawian military
 establishment (6,500 men) faces a major problem in trying to
 provide sufficient security to permit the reopening and
 operation of the Nacala railroad line through Mozambique to
 the Indian Ocean, pursuant to a December 1986 accord with
 Mozambique. The police, responsible for border security and
 rarely armed, also have had to deal with incidents of
 cross-border incursions by Mozambique National Resistance
 guerrillas (RENAMO).
 Malawi is a small, densely populated, landlocked country with
 few exploitable resources. Its current population of 8
 million people is growing at an estimated high annual rate of
 3.7 percent. Possessing no significant mineral resources or
 industrial sector, Malawi is heavily dependent on
 agriculture--tobacco, tea, sugar, peanuts, cotton, and
 sometimes corn--for export earnings and employment. Since
 1981 the Government has pursued an economic reform program
 with the assistance of the International Monetary Fund and the
 donor community. Despite steady growth in the mid-1980's, the
 combined effects of drought, the heavy burden of an influx of
 Mozambican refugees, and high transportation costs resulting
 from the closure of the rail routes through Mozambique have
 had significant negative impact on Malawi's economy in the
 past 2 years.
 Although there were no new human rights cases attracting
 international attention in 1988, human rights remain widely
 circumscribed. Several cases continued to draw appeals and
 inquiries from human rights groups--the cases of Orton and
 Vera Chirwa, who are both serving life sentences for treason
 (commuted from death sentences in 1984), and Jack Mapanje, a
 well-known professor and poet who has been detained without
 charge since September 1987. Malawi has become host to one of
 the largest refugee populations in Africa. Since mid-1986,
 Malawi has experienced a massive influx of Mozambicans fleeing
 famine and fighting between Mozambican government forces and
 RENAMO insurgents. By the end of October 1988, official
 estimates put the number of refugees at about 555,000 with
 approximately 20,000 new arrivals each month. Malawi's
 generous and humane treatment of these refugees, despite the
 deleterious effect of their presence on its economy and
 infrastructure, has been widely praised by the international
 community.

 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There were no allegations of politically motivated killings.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no known political disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Beatings by the police at the time of arrest or during
 detention are illegal but do occur. The officials responsible
 are rarely, if ever, disciplined for such abuses. Prison
 terms of hard labor are the norm for common criminals. Prison
 conditions are believed to be poor and food insufficient, but
 this is difficult to verify because access to prisons is
 tightly controlled.
 Amnesty International's (AI) 1988 report notes that Orton and
 Vera Chirwa were transferred in 1987 from Mikuyu Prison to
 Zomba Central Prison where conditions were described as poor.
 According to AI, Orton Chirwa was in bad health due to
 treatment at Mikuyu, which included long periods of being
 manacled and handcuffed to an iron bar at night. AI's 1988
 report also states that in 1987 Dr. Goodluck Mhango,
 associated with the Malawi Young Pioneers, sustained serious
 head injuries after beatings by police at the time he was
 taken into custody. AI had reports that Mhango may have been
 arrested because-of his brother, a journalist resident abroad,
 whose political writings may have displeased the Government.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Under the Preservation of Public Security Act, the Minister of
 Justice (a position currently held by President Banda) may
 order the.arrest, search, and detention of any person if he
 considers it to be necessary for the preservation of public
 order. A person arrested under this law can be detained
 indefinitely by the police without trial, but courts may issue
 a writ of habeas corpus upon application and review the
 detention. Persons may be detained indefinitely without
 charge for "political* offenses against the party or
 Government, but long-term detainees are normally charged
 officially and brought before the courts. Persons may also be
 detained without charge for periods up to a month and then
 released, apparently for making statements to which the
 Government objects. While it is difficult to estimate the
 number of arbitrary detentions and arrests made in Malawi in
 1988, it appears fewer than in previous years. Persons
 charged with crimes are usually held in custody while awaiting
 trial. In capital offenses, delays of 3 years or longer
 before a case is heard are common.
 A number of persons detained in past years apparently for
 their political views or, in some cases, offhand comments
 remain in detention. Aleke Banda, a former high-ranking
 government and party official, has been detained for over 8
 years and charges against him still have not been made
 public. Jack Mapanje, the head of the English Department at
 
 
 199
 MALAWI
 Chancellor College, was arrested by police on September 25,
 1987. The reasons for his detention have not been made
 public, but apparently are related to his poetry, some of
 which may have been seen as criticizing the Government.
 Mapanje was held incommunicado for several months, but his
 wife was allowed to visit him in 1988. In another case, a
 young Malawian, detained in October 1985 for asking in jest if
 President Banda would live long enough to enjoy his newest
 residence, remained in detention at the end of 1988.
 With regard to forced or compulsory labor, see Section 6.c.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Malawi has both a traditional court system, which deals with
 certain criminal cases, including capital offenses, and a
 modern court system, which generally handles civil cases and
 some criminal cases. Those charged under the military code of
 justice (including civilians) are tried in military courts.
 Lawyers are not permitted to assist defendants in regional
 traditional court cases, but legal counsel is permitted in the
 modern court system.- The right of appeal exists in both the
 modern and traditional court systems.
 In practice, the Government and party exert little control in
 cases tried in the modern court system, which consists of the
 Magistrate Courts, the High Court, and the Supreme Court of
 Appeal. The President appoints the Chief Justice of the High
 Court and, after consultation with the Judicial Service
 Commission, other modern court justices. These courts are
 open to the public, and defendants are charged publicly.
 The three traditional courts at the regional level deal with
 most capital offenses, including treason. Police officials
 handle the prosecution, and defendants conduct their own
 defense. Traditional court justices are-appointed directly by
 the President. Of the five members of each regional
 traditional court, three are chiefs generally without formal
 -legal training, one is a trained lawyer who advises the court,
 and the fifth, the chairman, has had a course in law. It is
 generally believed that there is little executive interference
 in traditional court cases dealing in nonpolitical matters of
 customary law. A guilty verdict is reviewed by the National
 Traditional Appeals Court, and a ministerial committee
 considers clemency.
 The Forfeiture Act permits the Government to revoke the
 property rights of those suspected of economic-crimes. These
 revocations sometimes have political overtones. When the
 Forfeiture Act is invoked, the person loses all worldly
 possessions, including business, financial, and personal
 assets. Revocation of property rights is carried out by
 executive fiat with no judicial review. Notice of forfeiture
 must be published in the official gazette. In 1988 four
 forfeiture actions were undertaken against individuals-and
 businesses, apparently because they were suspected qf
 involvement in illegak foreign exchange transactions.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Police can enter houses of suspects at will under special
 entry authority to conduct searches for suspects or
 incriminating evidence. In at least one trial in 1988,
 however, the judge disallowed evidence obtained without a
 
 
 200
 MALAWI
 proper warrant. Many citizens believe that a network of
 informers reports private statements and actions to the
 Government. The authorities have been known to open domestic
 and international mail.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 There is little public criticism of the Government and its
 policies, even by the Parliament. Public security regulations
 make it an offense to publish anything likely "to undermine
 the authority of, or public confidence in, the Government" and
 discussion of Malawi's political future after President Banda
 is not permitted.
 All publications, recordings, and movies entering Malawi are
 screened by the censorship board, and the current list of
 banned items includes more than 1,350 titles. The local media
 do not submit their news and programs to the Government in
 advance for approval or censorship, but informal, strict
 self-censorship "guidelines" are understood by the media. The
 penalty for publishing material which meets with official
 displeasure can be severe. Journalists have been jailed for
 extended periods for overstepping these "guidelines." The two
 newspapers and the sole government-owned radio station provide
 adequate and unbiased coverage of international issues. In
 addition, criticism of the efficiency of some government
 departments sometimes appears in the media and in
 parliamentary debate. Foreign journalists must request
 permission to enter Malawi and must specify in advance the
 topics they intend to cover.
 Limited freedom of inquiry into the natural and social
 sciences exists at the university and may include some
 examination of radical political ideologies, provided this
 does not extend to criticism of the Government.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 No political meetings are permitted other than those of the
 Malawi Congress Party. Individuals may be imprisoned if they
 further the aims of an "unlawful society," that is, any group
 considered to be "dangerous to the good government of the
 Republic." In the nonpolitical sphere, individuals and
 organizations generally are free to meet and associate.
 Professional, fraternal, and service organizations exist and
 are encouraged by the Government. For a discussion of freedom
 of association as it applies-to labor unions, see Section 6.a.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 There is no state or preferred religion, but religious groups
 are required to register with the Government. Except for the
 Jehovah'sWitnesses, religious groups generally may establish
 places of worship and train clergy. Religious publications,
 like all others, may not criticize the Government or the
 party. Most religious groups are free to establish and
 maintain links with coreligionists in other countries, and
 members are free to travel abroad. Similarly, foreign
 missionaries are permitted to enter Malawi and proselytize.
 However, in 1988, two members of the Pakistan-based Ahmadi
 sect, which considers itself Muslim despite theological
 divergences from traditional Islam, were arrested while
 visiting Malawi to explore the possibility of establishing an
 
 
 201
 MALAWI.
 Ahmadi mission. They were held for 6 weeks and subsequently
 deported. There is no tie between any particular religion and
 the Malawi Congress Party.
 Jehovah's Witnesses, whose religious convictions prevent them
 from joining political parties, have been banned since 1967.
 The Government considers the Witnesses' activities to be
 disruptive of "the prevailing calm, law, and order."
 Witnesses continue to be arrested-and charged on _ccasion. In
 1988 an employee of the U.S. Embassy in Lilongwe was charged
 with membership in the group and received a suspended sentence.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 There are few restrictions, in practice, on movement within
 Malawi, though legal provisions exist for restricting the
 movement of those convicted of political or criminal
 offenses. Asian residents and citizens are free to travel
 within the country but must reside and work in one of four
 urban areas (Lilongwe, Zomba, Mzuzu, and Blantyre/Limbe).
 Denial of passports on political grounds frequently extends to
 family members of persons in political disfavor and to those
 persons the Government suspects may criticize it if allowed to
 travel abroad. Civil servants and employees of state-owned
 enterprises must obtain written permission to travel abroad,
 even on vacation. Obtaining such a clearance can take from a
 few days to several months. Formal emigration is neither
 restricted nor encouraged. There is a small outward flow of
 political dissidents from the country. Citizenship may be
 revoked but in practice this is not done.
 Malawi has acted in an exemplary manner toward the large
 influx of Mozambican refugees it hosts. The refugees, located
 in heavily populated areas with little available land, have
 placed a great strain on the economy and on the transportation
 and social services networks. The Government has devoted many
 of its own scarce resources to assisting the refugees and has
 permitted international and private voluntary organizations to
 operate relief efforts. These efforts are coordinated by a
 committee chaired by the Ministry of Health. The United
 Nations. High Commissioner for Refugees and other international
 assistance groups are able to travel freely to assess relief
 needs and to investigate allegations of protection problems.
 In one apparently isolated incident in March, 6 Mozambican
 refugees were forcibly repatriated after organizing a protest
 against delays in receiving rations. The refugees, however,
 reportedly were allowed to return to Malawi shortly after
 their repatriation.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Citizens of Malawi do not, in practice, have the ability to
 change their government. Major political decisions are made
 either directly by the President or those few persons closely
 associated with him. No opposition political parties or
 movements are permitted. Membership in the Malawi Congress
 Party is not mandatory but is often coerced. Membership is
 expected of those who aspire to government positions
 (including the Civil Service) or professional success outside
 of government. Party membership is often required of school
 children and of those who seek access to government services
 or entrance to local markets. The annual renewal fee is only
 about 25 cents, but this can be nearly half a day's pay for a
 
 
 202
 MALAWI
 minimum wage earner. In addition, when the President visits
 an area, financial contributions from individuals and
 businesses are expected. Nearly half the population holds at
 least nominal party membership.
 The party structure provides for some choice among candidates
 for party, parliamentary, and other offices. For example, in
 the parliamentary elections held in 1987, there were several
 candidates for election in a number of constituencies. Nearly
 one-half of the incumbent members of the National Assembly
 were not reelected. All nominees, however, were selected by
 the party and approved by the President. Active political
 campaigning is not permitted. The National Assembly,
 consisting of both elected and a few appointed members, is
 mainly concerned with ratifying government policy. Its powers
 are broadly based in law but highly circumscribed in
 practice. There is no serious discussion of policy questions
 during parliamentary debates. Women, who may belong to the
 party and vote, hold 11 of the 123 seats in Parliament. No
 women hold ministerial level positions.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government does not permit organizations such as the
 International Committee of the Red Cross or AI to conduct
 human rights investigations in Malawi. Nongovernmental
 organizations devoted to the furtherance of human rights are
 not permitted to exist. Expressions of interest in alleged
 human rights problems by outside groups or persons are not
 welcomed and are usually ignored. Few government officials
 are even willing to discuss the subject of human rights.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Malawi is one of the world's least developed countries, but
 the economic and social needs of ethnic Africans are generally
 met on a nondiscriminatory basis. Asian residents, however,
 are discriminated against. For instance, Asians, whether
 Malawian citizens or not, have been compelled to transfer
 ownership of rural shops and trucking businesses to ethnic
 African Malawian citizens. Moreover, strict rules governing
 where Asians may own property result in limitations on where
 they may reside. Changes in the citizenship law in 1986
 eliminated a provision whereby persons who held foreign
 passports could reside indefinitely in Malawi. These changes
 in the law, together with actions under the Forfeiture Act
 (which have been applied in large measure against Asians),
 have led many in the small Asian community (about 5,000
 persons) to leave Malawi and others to question their
 long-term future there.
 Women are generally limited to the roles defined by a
 traditional African society and do not have opportunities
 equal to those of men, although the President takes a special
 interest in the status of women and supports a number of
 programs designed to benefit them. As mothers, women enjoy
 access to the traditional health services and to extension
 programs designed to improve homemaking abilities. Such
 programs, while beneficial, have not given full recognition to
 the importance of women as agricultural producers in the rural
 sector (roughly 70 percent of all smallholder farms and over
 50 percent of subsistence holdings are headed by women) and
 
 
 MALAWI
 the potential role women can have in the modern sector.
 Although males still have a comparative advantage in terms of
 educational and employment opportunities, the Government has
 initiated programs to begin to rectify existing
 discrimination. For example, a third of the positions in the
 public education system have been reserved for women.
 Although Malawi's traditional tribal leadership structures are
 primarily matrilineal, several small ethnic groups grant fewer
 rights and privileges to women and occasionally continue to
 practice female circumcision.
 Malawi enjoys a considerable degree of ethnolinguistic
 uniformity. The vast majority of the population speaks or
 understands Chichewa, which became the national language in
 1968. English is the official language for government and
 business. Malawi's indigenous groups are sufficiently alike
 in culture and social organization to permit relatively easy
 interaction, including intermarriage, social and residential
 intermixture in agricultural settlements, and political
 cooperation.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 In the small wage sector, workers have the right of
 association, and labor unions exist. However, their
 activities are highly circumscribed, and they are generally
 ineffective in achieving gains for workers. The reasons for
 this are economic as well as political: the economy of Malawi
 can sustain only a small number of wage earners, most of whom
 occupy positions as unskilled laborers on large estate farms.
 Malawi law provides for the right to strike, but in practice
 strikes do not occur. Labor unions come under an umbrella
 organization,.the Trades Union Congress of Malawi (TUCM).
 With government supervision, the TUCM associates with
 international organizations and is a member of the
 Organization of African Trade Union Unity and of the
 International Confederation of Free Trade Unions. The
 Southern African Trade Union Coordination Council is scheduled
 to open a permanent office in Malawi in the near future.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 Workers have the legal right to organize. Collective
 bargaining is allowed, but its use is limited. The Government
 has set a minimum wage and regulates working conditions but
 does not intervene overtly in the collective bargaining
 process. Malawi has no export processing zones, and labor
 legislation is applied uniformly throughout the country.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Forced labor is prohibited by law and is not practiced.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 The minimum working age is 14, but this applies only to the
 relatively small urban wage sector. In the large subsistence
 agriculture sector, children work on family farms at a younger
 age.
 
 
 204
 MALAWI
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 Less than 15 percent of the work force is employed in the
 formal wage sector. For those fortunate enough to hold paid
 jobs, wages and working conditions are generally adequate, and
 paid holidays and safety standards in the workplace are
 required by law. However, enforcement of these standards is
 limited. Malawi's low wage levels--the minimum wage is about
 50 cents per day in the urban areas--reflect the abundance of
 unskilled labor and the Government's policy of limiting the
 rural-urban income gap and hence the rate of migration to the
 towns. Government regulations limit the workweek to 45 hours
 in the construction industry, and 48 hours in other
 industries. In practice, most employees work between 37.5 and
 42.5 hours per week over 5 days.
