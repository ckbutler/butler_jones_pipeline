 JAMAICA
 Jamaica is a constitutional parliamentary democracy and a member of the Com-
 monwealth of Nations. The Governor General, appointed by the Crown on the advice
 of the Prime Minister, represents the Queen as Head of State. The elected Prime
 Minister, the leader of the majority party in Parliament, is the head of government.
 The Parliament is composed of an elected House of Representatives and an ap-
 pointed Senate. Two major political parties have alternated in power since the first
 elections under universal adult suffrage in 1944. The People's National Party (PNP)
 holds 52 of the 60 seats in the House of Representatives. The opposition Jamaica
 Labor Party (JLP) which formed the Government from 1980 to 1989, holds the re-
 maining 8 seats. The last general election, held in March, was marred by political
 violence and fraud.
 The security forces consist of the Jamaica Constabulary Force (JCF-police), the
 Island Special Constabulary Force (ISCF-auxiliary police), and the Jamaica De-
 fense Force (JDF-army, air wing, and coast guard). The JCF and ISCF report to
 the Ministry of National Security. The JDF is responsible to the Prime Minister in
 his capacity as Defense Minister. The JCF has repeatedly and accurately been cited
 for human rights abuses and political partisanship; the JDF has been responsible
 for some, albeit fewer, abuses.
 Jamaica's economy is based on primary products (bauxite/alumina,sugar, ba-
 nanas), services (tourism), and light manufacturing (garment assembly). The Gov-
 ernment has promoted private investment to stimulate economic growth and mod-
 ernization, pursuing in the process a sometimes painful program of structural ad-
 justment. Side effects of this program have included inflation, currency devaluation,
 and large-scale layoffs in the public sector.
 Jamaica's principal human rights abuses are extrajudicial killings and beatings
 by police and prison guards and, to a lesser extent, members of the army. Such
 killings are often carried out with impunity. While a few police and army personnel
 were prosecuted for manslaughter or murder, the local media and human rights
 gups attributed new execution-style killings to members of the security forces.
 her abuses include violence against women, including attacks by police; searches
 without warrants; indefinite detention; brutal treatment of detainees; and vigilan-
 tism. Conditions in Jamaican jails and prisons remain appalling, with serious over-
 crowding, awful sanitary conditions, and inadequate diet the norm. An inefficient
 and ovelurdened judiciary was responsible for lengthy delays in trials, sentencing,
 and appeals.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-The March 30 general election was
 preceded by a brief but violent campaign during which between 14 and 22 persons
 were killed by political partisans andor members of the security forces in February
 and March. In the only pre-election killing with political overtones allegedly commit-
 ted by security forces, a JDF lieutenant and a lance corporal were charged with the
 
 
 484
 
 March 27 killing of JCF constable Rupert Sinclair, who was acting as a bodyguard
 for JLP candidate for Parliament Ernest Smith. Eyewitnesses reported that Sin-
 clair, who identified himself as a policeman was shot in the stomach while being
 questioned by the soldiers. A trial was set to begin on October 11, but had not begun
 byyear's end.
 On March 26 election oincial Dennis Brooks was shot and killed in Old Harbour,
 St. Catherine. The suspected killer, a PNP supporter, was later found dead of mul-
 tiple gunshot wounds one day after his arrest, and subsequent unexplained release,
 for the killing of a .JLP supporter.
 There continue to be credible reports that the JCF engages in the summary execu-
 tion of suspects under the guise of "shoot-outs." Local edia accounts disputing JCF
 claims of shoot-outs (often quoting eyewitness accounts in direct contra diction) ap-
 peared with increasing frequency in 1993. One case which drew particular media
 attention oncerned the July 16 shooting death of two robbery suspects at Nuttall
 private hospital in Kingston. While intial JCF reports indicated the two men,
 fredo      and Leroy Chin, were killed in a shoot-out, eyewitness accounts from
 health professionals and other credible witnesses maintained that Bell was chased
 into the hospital, taken outside by JCF personnel, forced to lie prone and shot in
 the back of the head. One of six JCF officers involved was charged with capital mur-
 der and suspended while the investigation and pro; azution proceeded.
 Statistics collected over several years from the JCF show that the number of peo-
 ple shot and killed by the police routinely exceeds the number shot but only wound-
 ed. In 1993 the JCF listed 67 people shot and wounded by police officers, while 91
 were shot and killed. For 1992 the figures were 69 shot and wounded, 107 shot and
 killed. Prosecutions of security officials for extrajudicial killings appeared to in-
 crease. Overall, seven JCF members were charged, suspended, or prosecuted for
 murder or manslaughter in 1993, compared with four in 1992.
 The new Commissioner of Police, Army Colonel (ret) Trevor MacMillan, the first
 chosen from outside the ranks of the JCF since 1966, was appointed with a mandate
 to reform the police. In October he ordered the disbanding of the Special Operations
 Unit and the restructuring of the Protective Service Unit, both of which had been
 responsible for much political partisanship.
 Extrajudicial killings of persons in official custody continued. Four JCF inspectors
 and a superintendent were charged on April 2 with manslaughter in connection
 with the deaths of three detainees in the Constant Spring police jail in October
 1992. The trial of the five had not begun by the end ot 1993. In another incident,
 the death of detainee John Headley in the Ramble jail in November 1992 a detec-
 tive constable and another JCF officer were charged with manslaughter in iate May.
 According to eyewitness acounts from fellow detainees, 1-leadley died under interro-
 gation from repeated beatings as the accused officers sought a confession in the case
 of a stolen cow. The accused had not been tried by year's end.
 Vigilantism, involving spontaneous mob executions, occurred with some frc-luency
 in Jamaica in 1993. Residents often complained that help from the police, particu-
 larly in rural areas, was tardy or nonexistent; in many such cases, the response to
 crimes from agricultural larceny to armed robbery was the rapid formation of a local
 mob which beat, stoned, or 'chopped" (with machetes) the alleged criminals to
 death. Police rarely brought charges against vigilantes, and acquittals were common
 in the few cases that did go to court.
 b. Disappearance.-There was no evidence of politically re!ted abduction or dis-
 appearances perpetrated by the security forces or others in 1993.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Torture and other abuse of prisoners and detainees an' prohibited by law. Nonethe-
 less, there were numerous credible complaints of beatings, in many cases to obtain
 confessions, by guards and security personnel of inmates held in jails and prisons.
 The Jamaica Council on Human Rights (JCHR) reported that the beating of detain-
 ees on the soles of the feet in order to obtain confessions was a common practice;
 in one incident, it said, police forced one detainee to beat the soles of a friend and
 fellow detainee. In recent years, the Government has paid out hundreds of thou-
 sands of dollars in civil damages to settle suits brought against security personnel
 for brutal treatment; the most recent available figure, for 1991, was $333,000.
 The Police Public Complaints Authority (PPCA), a nonpartisan civilian body
 which began operations in April, received over 150 complaints in its initial months
 of operation. Most complaints charged excessive use of force or abuse of power. The
 PPCA's chairman told local media in August that the authority's work was being
 hampered by a lack of reliable witnesses. The PPCA may refer cases to the Commis-
 sioner of Police; if not satisfied with the Commissioner's actions, the Authority may
 report on the matter to the Governor General. At year's end however, no JCF per-
 sonnel had been charged or prosecuted for matters arising from PPCA complaints.

 There were no significant changes in conditions in maximum security prisons and
 police jails, which remain abysmal. Sanitary conditions are appalling and dan-
 gerous, food inadequate at best, and overcrowding the rule rather than the excep-
 tion. Several police jails were temporarily closed during the year in an effort to cope
 with raw sewage running through the grounds; others, including Central jail in
 Kingston and Barnett Street jail in Montego Bay, remained open under substan-
 tially the same conditions. At the general penitentiary in Kingston, up to six men
 are held in the 7- by 10-foot cells in the remand section, in near total darkness, for
 16 to 20 hours a day.
 The failure to provide adequate and timely medical attention is a further problem,
 especially given the degrading sanitary conditions. Prisoners and detainees who can
 afford to pay find access to medical treatment, supplemental food, and other amen-
 ities. Prisoners without access to money from family members and friends must sub-
 sist on the $0.60 a day per inmate budgeted for food.
 A 1992 amendment to Jamaica's Offenses Against the Person Act, which sepa-
 rated murder into capital and noncapital categories, elicited a great deal of comment
 on the revised Act and on the death penalty in general during 1993. A number of
 commentators, including the JCHR, questioned the propriety of allowing 10- to 15-
 year delays in executions for a large number of convicted murderers. They charged
 that, the question of the rightness or wrongness of the death penalty aside, such
 lengthy delays themselves constituted cruel, inhuman, and degrading punishment.
 In November the Privy Council cmmuted the death sentences of two convicted mur-
 derers, saying their 14 years on death row amounted to inhuman treatment. There
 have been no executions in Jamaica since 1988 and no ex post facto applications
 of the death penalty.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Suppression of Crimes Act (SOCA),
 adopted in 1974 and still in force in Kingston, St. Andrew, and St. Catherine par-
 ishes, allows police to make arrests and conduct warrantless searches of the homes
 and property of persons "reasonably" suspected of having committed a crime. It has
 also een used as justification for curfews in urban areas. The Government prom-
 ised on several occasions during 1993 to repeal the SOCA; by the end of the year,
 however, the law was still on the books.
 Detention of suspects without a warrant occurs regularly, particularly in poor
 neighborhoods. Many detainees are held for several weeks without being brought
 before a judge or magistrate, in contravention of the law, which sets a maximum
 of 48 hours for detention without a hearing. For Jamaican suspects charged with
 a crime, there is a functioning bail system. Foreign detainees, however, are regu-
 larly denied bail. Persons unable to post bail while waiting for a judicial hearing
 are often detained for long periods. Detainees constitute 15 percent of the maximum
 security prison population; the average length of detention before trial has not been
 determined but ranges from 6 to 52 weeks.
 Some 80-100 persons are currently awaiting trial "at the pleasure of the Governor
 General," usually for capital offenses committed as minors. They are subject to in-
 definite detention; many have been held for more than 10 years. Others in the
 group, mostly mentally ill have been judged unfit to plead. A man held for 24 years
 without trial was released in September to the care of his family after a public out-
 cry stemming from media reports of his plight. Other such cases were under review
 by the Governor General at year's end.
 Under a 1992 joint police-military campaign called "Operation Ardent," the Gov-
 ernment established rapid response units in three locations to combat increasingly
 violent crime. By mid-1993, however, the Anti-Crime Investigation Detachment
 (ACID) replaced Operation Ardent as the latest anticrime initiative. ACID members
 were almost immediately linked to reports of summary executions (see Section l.a.,
 the Nuttall hospital incident). The three military detention centers which were to
 be used to house Operation Ardent detainees, meanwhile, were constructed but
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial-There is a well-established right to counsel for
 persons charged with criminal offenses; indigents, however, must have been accused
 of a "serious offense" (e.g., murder, rape, robbery, firearms offenses) to qualify for
 court-appointed counsel. Many offenses, including wounding with intent (to cause
 great bodily harm), are not considered 'serious," and many defendants are thus con-
 victed without benefit of counsel. The Court of Appeal andthe Parliament may refer
 cases to the judicial committee of the Privy Council in the United Kingdom (see Sec-
 A special gun court, established in 1974, considers all cases involving the illegal
 use or possession of firearms and ammunition. Public attendance is restricted, and
 cases are heard by a panel of three judges, with less rigorous rules of evidence than
 
 
 486
 in regular court proceedings. In capital cases, hearings before the gun court serve
 as preliminaries to jury trials under the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court.
 The judicial system, although independent, is overburden ed and operates with in-
 adequate resources. Budgetary shortfalls have resulted in a steady attrition of
 trained personnel causing further delays. Many cases take years to come to trial,
 and others have had to be dismissed because case files could not be located. One
 case required 50 visits to court by the parties before a decision was reached; another
 has been on the books of the May Pen district court since 1972. The Government
 in recent years took some steps to reverse the deterioration of the legal system,
 which included raising judicial salaries, increasing training for judicial personnel,
 upgrading court house facilities, and providing technical assistance to institutional-
 ize an improved court administration system. The effects on caseloads and average
 length of proceedings have so far been minimal, however.
 There are no political prisoners in Jamaica.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution prohibits arbitrary intrusion by the State into the private life of the
 individual. Under the SOCA, however, homes or businesses believed to be occupied
 by persons "reasonably" suspected by the police of having committed a crime may
 be searched without a warrant. This authority is frequently abused.
 Although the use of telephone taps without a court order is officially limited to
 cases involving the drug trade, terrorism, and subversion of the Government,
 charges have been raised in recent years by political and trade union officials that
 their telephones were being tapped. These charges have not been addressed by the
 authorities.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-.-Freedom of speech and press are provided for
 in the Constitution and are observed in practice within the broad limits of libel laws
 and the Official Secrets Act.
 The Jamaica Broadcasting Company (JEC), largely freed from government owner-
 ship in 1988, operates two radio stations and one of the island's two television chan-
 nels. A private television station went on the air in May, while two other privately
 owned FM radio stations also began operation during the year. The Government s
 brloadcast commission has the right to regulate promiraning during emergencies.
 Foreign television transmissions are unregulated and available to a sizable number
 of Jamaicans through satellite antennas.
 Jamaica's four largest newspapers, all privately owned, regularly report on al-
 leged human rights abuses, particularly those involving the JCF. Foreign publica-
 tions are widely available. There is no censorship or interlerence in academic insti-
 tutions.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 freedom of assembly and association. Public rallies are staged by all political par-
 ties. Such events require a police permit, which is normally granted. Large numbers
 and varieties of professional, business, service, soial, and cultural associations func-
 tion freely.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-Freedom of religion is provided for by the Constitution
 and is well established. More than 80 percent of the population belongs to various
 Christian denominations, and religious groups of all kinds operate freely. Evan-
 gelical Christian movements have gaine[ a significant following, and foreign evan-
 gelists visit regularly.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Constitution provides Jamaican citizens freedom of movement and
 immunity from expulsion from the country. Apart from persons under criminal in-
 vestigation, there are no restrictions on foreign travel or emigration. Citizenship is
 not revoked for political reasons.
 Those who apply for refugee status are handled on a case-by-case basis. In coordi-
 nation with the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in 1991, the Ja-
 maican Government established a facility which processed mor' than 100 Haitian
 boat people, who were housed, clothed, and fed throughout 1992. By the end of 1993,
 some 30-35 remained in Jamaica, the rest having ben voluntarily repatriated to
 Haiti. There were occasions when      the Jamaican    Government refused    the
 disembarcation of Cuban asylum seekers.
 Section 3. Respect for Polilical Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Jamaicans have, and freely exercise, the right to change their government. All
 citizens aged 18 and over have the right to vote b secret ballot. The March 30 gen-
 eral election was marred, however, by fraud which occurred on a large scale within
 
 
 487
 the urban constituencies of Kingston, and to a lesser but still significant extent in
 nearby parishes. In an April 2 statement, Professor Gladstone Mills, chairman of
 the electoral advisory committee, called the theft and stuffing of ballot boxes and
 repeat voting by hundreds of people "a terrible and sad travesty of the democratic
 process." Observers found particularly troubling the involvement of elements of the
 security forces: in addition to the murder of Rupert Sinclair (Section 1.a.), members
 of the JCF were observed by the local and international media assisting in the take-
 over of polling stations by one party or the other. Indeed, the results from some sta-
 tions depended on which party was able to bring the greater threat of force to bear.
 According to Professor Mills, the murder 3 days before the election of electoral of-
 ficial Dennis Brooks also had a substantial effect on the willingness of electoral offi-
 cials to do their jobs on election day, contributing to delays in opening and the pre-
 mature closing of some polling stations. Such action effectively disenfranchised
 thousands of voters, either by shortened polling hours or by threats of violence from
 armed political gangs. Nevertheless, observers, including the opposition JLP, con-
 ceded that the overall result of the election was not altered by the fraud which took
 place, even though individual seats may have been decided as a result of fraud.
 The JLP boycotted a by-election in late November, charging that appropriate elec-
 toral reforms were not in place. The election, won overwhelmingly by the PNP can-
 didate, was contested by one independent and two small-party candidates, who
 charged that voter turnout figures were inflated, and that some of their votes were
 lost owing to electoral irregularities. The security forces appeared to have performed
 their duties professionally on election day; no charges of violence or malfeasance
 were raised against members of the army or police.
 There are no de jure limitations to the participation of women in politics at any
 level. In practice, women constitute a small minority of national parliamentarians
 and an only slightly higher proportion of local council members. Women in politics,
 as in Jamaican business, hold few leadership positions; they tend, on the other
 hand, to dominate in administrative areas.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 There are no restrictions on human rights organizations in Jamaica. The JCHR
 the country's only formal human rights organization, has vigorously protested
 abuses by the police and has called for corrective reforms. Its work was hampered,
 however, b a ack of adequate resources. There was no official followup on the Au-
 gust 1992 break-in and fire at the JCHR headquarters, which effectively shut the
 organization down for 3 months. The JCHR's coordinator, chairman, and vice-chair-
 man continued to receive death threats in 1993.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 Women.-While Jamaican women are theoretically accorded full equality under
 the Constitution and under the 1975 Employment Act, in practice they suffer from
 economic discrimination sexual harassment in the workplace, and cultural and so-
 cial traditions which do little to discourage violence against women.
 Sexual assault reports increased from 1,091 in 1991 to 1,155 in 1992. According
 to the authorities, reports of violence against women increased again in 1993 al-
 though figures were unavailable at year's end. Complaints filed with the JCHR al-
 leging police attacks on women have increased dramatically in the last few years,
 leading the organization to focus formally on women's issues for the first time since
 its creation in 1968. A police instructor allegedly raped a young woman recruit at
 the police academy on August 16; he was arrested the same day. By year's end, his
 trial had not begun.
 The Women's Crisis Center and Sistren (a women's resource collective) both re-
 ported increases in the number of, and level of violence involved in, attacks against
 women. Women remain reluctant to bring assault charges against their domestic
 partners when jail is seen as the likely result. The Government, which promised leg-
 islation to introduce noncustodialsentencing for nonweapon offenses, had not done
 so by the end of 1993.
 Children.-The Government has gone on record several times over the past dec-
 ade as supporting the rights and welfare of children. Limited resources, however,
 make it difficult or the Government to monitor the status of children at school, in
 the workplace, or at home. The only legislation which specifically addresses the
 rights of children is the Juvenile Act (see Section 6.d.).
 The treatment of children in Jamaican society received increased public attention
 in 1993. Sexual abuse and child labor practices were particular areas of concern. A
 University of the West Indies study released in April showed that 13 percent of
 
 
 488
 eighth-grade girls questioned had faced attempted rape, while 4 percent had actu-
 ally been raped, often by a family member. Additionally, 22 percent had witnessed
 acts of violence involving weapons at home, while 40 percent had witnessed similar
 acts at school.
 Indienous People.-While there are no indigenous peoples remaining in Jamaica,
 several community groups descended from freed and escaped slaves, called Maroons
 live in separate communities in the interior of the island. Since British colonial
 times, the Maroons have enjoyed a degree of autonomy granted by treaty. There
 were no charges of political or other discrimination made by Maroon leaders in
 1993. However, they continue to press claims for land rights which they say the
 Government has not honored.
 Religious Minorities.-The Rastafarians, a sect dedicated to black repatriation to
 Africa, have repeatedly charged the Government with religious persecution over the
 years; often, however, the charges stem from criminal prosecutions brought for pos-
 session and use of marijuana, the smoking of which the Rastafarians regard as a
 sacrament.
 People with Disabilities.-There have been no organized campaigns to make struc-
 tures and facilities accessible to disabled persons, and there are no laws mandating
 provision of accessibility for people with disabilities. A government-sponsored "dis-
 abilities week," held in September, helped raise public awareness of the problems
 which confront disabled Jamaicans.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution specifically provides for the right
 to form or join a trade union. There are no categories of workers who do not have
 the right to form unions. Labor unions function freely and independently of the Gov-
 ernment. The Labor Relations and Industrial Disputes Act (LRIDA) codifies worker
 rights. There is a spectrum of national unions, some of which are associated with
 political parties. Approximately 15 percent of the labor force is organized.
 Jamaican law neither authorizes nor prohibits the right to strike, but unions and
 workers do strike. Striking workers can interrupt work without criminal liability
 but cannot be assured of keeping their jobs. Workers in 10 broad categories of "es-
 sential services" are prohibited from striking, a provision of the LRIDA which the
 International Labor Organization (ILO) has repeatedly condemned as overly inclu-
 sive. There was a major increase in workdays lost to industrial action in 1993, as
 workers attempted to regain buying power lost to inflation over the preceding 3
 years. No strikes were declared illegal in 1993.
 Jamaican unions maintain a wide variety of regional and international affili-
 ations.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The Constitution provides for
 the right to organize and belong to labor unions, and LRIDA provisions include
 guidelines for labor, management, and government on issues such as organizing
 work sites, negotiating agreements, and conflict resolution. The Government rarely
 interferes with union organization efforts, and judicial and police authorities effec-
 tively enforce the LRIDA and other labor regulations.
 Labor, management, and the Government remain firmly committed by law and
 in practice to collective bargaining in contract negotiations and conflict resolution,
 even in some nonunion settings. When labor and management fail to reach an
 agreement, cases may be referred to an independent Industrial Disputes Tribunal
 (IDT), which forms the first appeal level above the Ministry of Labor. Any cases not
 resolved by the IDT pass to the civil courts.
 The LRIDA prohibits antiunion discrimination: for example, employees may not
 be fired solely for union membership. Employees unlawfully fired for union activities
 may choose to be reinstated or receive appropriate compensation, under the direc-
 tion of the Industrial Disputes Tribunal. This law has been effectively enforced. On
 the other hand, union affiliation may not be a prerequisite for employment.
 Domestic labor laws apply in the "free zones" (export processingzones); however,
 there are no unionized companies in any of them. Union organizers attribute this
 to resistance by foreign owners in the zones to organizing e5forts and government
 reluctance to allow union access. Nonetheless, the free zones were hit by labor un-
 rest in July and attempts to organize plants within the zones continue. Company-
 controlled "workers' councils" handle grievance resolution at most free zone compa-
 nies. Wages and conditions within the free zones, set by management, are generally
 as good as or better than those in similar industries outside the zones. The Labor
 Ministry, however, discontinued inspections of the zones in mid-1992 due to budget
 cutbacks.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Constitution does not specifi-
 cally address the matter of forced or compulsory labor. However, Jamaica is a party
 
 
 489
 
 to both ILO conventions that prohibit compulsory labor, and there have been no al-
 legations that this practice exists in Jamaica.
 d. Minimum Age for Emploment of Children.-The Juvenile Act provides that
 children under the age of 12 shall not be employed except by parents or guardians
 and that such employment may be only in domestic, agricultural or horticultural
 work. However, enforcement is erratic. Children under 12 years of age can be seen
 peddling goods or services on city streets. There is no evidence of widespread illegal
 employment of children in other sectors of the economy. The Educational Act stipu-
 lates that all children aged 6 to 11 must attend elementary school. Industrial safety,
 police, and truant officers are charged with enforcement. Given the difficult eco-
 nomic circumstances of the past few years however, thousands of children were
 kept home for varying periods to help with housework and to keep expenses down.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The minimum wage, $10 (J$300) per week, is
 widely considered inadequate. Most salaried workers are paid more than the legal
 minimum wage. Work over 40 hours per week or 8 hours per day must be com-
 pensated at overtime rates, a provision which is widely observed. The law provides
 for a 24-hour rest day per week, during which workers may choose to work in ex-
 change for double pay. The Labor Ministry's Industrial Safety Division is charged
 with setting and enforcing industrial health and safety standards, which outside ex-
 perts consider adequate. Industrial accident rates were once again low in 1993. The
 Ministries of Labor, Finance, the Public Service and National Security are charged
 with enforcing labor laws and regulations; again, however, the reduction of the pub-
 lic service in 1992 had a grave impact on the ability of those ministries to enforce
 the law. Workers are guaranteed the right to remove themselves from dangerous
 work situations without jeopardy to their continued employment if they are trade
 union members or covered by the Factories Act; other categories of workers are not
 specifically protected by law in those circumstances.
