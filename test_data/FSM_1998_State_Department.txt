 FEDERATED STATES OF MICRONESIA
 The Federated States of Micronesia (FSM) is composed of 607 small islands ex-
 tending over a large area of the central Pacific. Four states-Chuuk (formerly Truk),
 Kosrae, Pohnpei, and Yap-make up the federation. The population is estimated at
 130,000, mostly of Micronesian origin. The four states were part of the Trust Terri-
 tory of the Pacific Islands and were administered by the United States from 1947
 to 1986 -pursuant to an agreement with the United Nations. Political legitimacy
 rests on the popular will expressed by a majority vote through elections in accord-
 ance with the Constitution. There are three branches of government: An executive
 branch led by a president who also serves as head of state, a unicameral legislature
 elected from the four constituent states, and a judicial system that applies criminal
 and civil laws and procedures closely paralleling those of the United States.
 Under the Compact of Free Association, the United States is responsible for de-
 fense. The FSM has no security forces of its own, aside from national police operat-
 ing under the office of the Secretary of Justice and public safety officers operating
 under the authority of the attorneys general of the individual state governments.
 Members of the police committed a few human rights abuses.
 The economy depends heavily on transfer payments from the United States, fish-
 ing, tourism, and subsistence agriculture.
 The Government generally respects the human rights of its citizens. However, in
 several incidents police mistreated citizens. Traditional customs sustain a value sys-
 tem that distinguishes between people on the basis of social status and sex. There
 is evidence of an increase in both spousal abuse and child neglect, and government
 agencies often ignore such problems due to the constraints imposed by traditional
 society. So far, neither the Government nor other organizations have successfully
 filled the role of the traditional extended family in protecting and supporting its
 members.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political or
 other extrajudicial killings.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 There was no pattern of torture or other cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment
 or punishment. However, in several incidents police were found responsible for mis-
 treatment of persons, resulting in substantial cash settlements to the victims. The
 officers involved in the incidents were removed from the police force.
 Prison conditions meet minimum international standards.
 There are no local organizations concerning themselves solely with human rights,
 and the question of visits by human rights monitors has not arisen.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Legal procedures, for the most part pat-
 terned after U.S. law, provide for due process, which is carefully observed. Exile is
 not used.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution provides for an independent judi-
 ciary, and it is independent in practice.
 The Chief Justice of the Supreme Court is appointed by the President, with the
 advice and consent of the Congress.
 Public trial is provided for in the Bill of Rights, and trials are conducted -fairly.
 Juveniles may have closed hearings. Despite these provisions, cultural resistance to
 litigation and incarceration as methods of maintaining public order has allowed
 
 
 1009
 some persons to act with impunity. Serious cases of sexual and other assault and
 even murder have not gone to trial, and suspects are routinely released indefinitely.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The law
 prohibits such arbitrary interference, and in practice there is none.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for these rights, and
 unlike in 1997, the Government's support for these rights was not called openly into
 question. The establishment of a new biweekly newspaper, the Island Tribune, was
 a positive development. In addition to providing general reporting on events in the
 FSM, the newspaper explores and addresses controversial issues. In doing so, it fol-
 lowed a policy of offering individuals on opposing sides of the issues the opportunity
 to voice their views. Although generally successful in these endeavors, the news-
 paper encountered barriers when it sought to obtain access to some public docu-
 ments, such as Supreme Court records. Other newspapers with more limited circula-
 tions also began publishing late in the year, including the Pohnpei Business News
 and Micronesia Weekly. None of these newspapers covers matters in as controver-
 sial a fashion as the now defunct FSM News. This may be partially attributable to
 the lingering effect of the 1997 episode in which the Government refused permission
 to reenter the FSM to the Canadian national who was the writer and editor of the
 newspaper.
 The national government and the four states publish newsletters. Each of the four
 state governments controls a radio station broadcasting primarily in the local lan-
 guage. One religious group operates a private radio station. The population of
 Pohnpei has increasing access to live satellite-televised information from around the
 worl and tape-delayed broadcasts of programming by the major U.S. networks.
 However, none of the other three states has a television receiver station, and few
 residents have individual satellite dishes.
 There is an increasing level of open public discussion of social and governmental
 issues on various Internet sites. The Internet played an important role in allowing
 citizens in the four states, as well as those residing outside the country, an oppor-
 tunity to share views and opinions.
 Academic freedom is respected.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Bill of Rights provides for
 freedom of peaceful assembly, and the Government respects this right in practice.
 During political campaigns, citizens often question candidates at public meetings
 and social gatherings.
 The Bill of Rights provides for freedom of association, and the Government re-
 spects this right in practice. Formal associations are uncommon, but organizations
 for students and women exist.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Bill of Rights forbids establishment of a state reli-
 gion and governmental restrictions on freedom of religion; the Government respects
 this freedom in practice. It is hospitable to diverse religions, and missionaries of
 many faiths work within the nation.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Constitution has specific provisions for freedom of movement with-
 in the country. It is silent on foreign travel, emigration, and repatriation, but in
 practice none of these is restricted.
 Three Vietnamese fled a United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees
 (UNHCR) camp in Indonesia and sailed to Yap in November. The Government
 sought other countries to accept these three as refugees. The Government has not
 formulated a policy regarding refugees, asylees, or first asylum.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens have the right to change their government. The Congress is elected by
 popular vote from each state; the Congress then chooses the President and Vice
 President from among its four at-large senators by majority vote. State governors,
 state legislators, and municipal governments are elected by direct popular vote. Po-
 litical campaigning is unrestricted, and, as there are no established political parties,
 political support is generally courted from among family and allied clan groupings,
 as well as religious groups.
 There are no restrictions on the formation of political groups, but there have been
 no significant efforts to form political parties.
 Cultural factors in the male-dominated society have limited women's representa-
 tion in government and politics. Although women are represented in midlevel posi-
 
 
 1010
 
 tions at both the federal and state level, very few women are found in leadership
 roles at the highest government levels.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 There were no known requests for investigations of alleged human rights viola-
 tions. While there are no official restrictions, there are no local groups exclusively
 concerned with human rights. However, there are women's groups that concern
 themselves with rights for women and children.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 Although the Constitution provides explicit protection against discrimination
 based on race, sex, language, or religion, there is extensive societal discrimination,
 notably discrimination and violence against women. Government enforcement of
 these constitutional protections is weak.
 Women.-Most violence against women occurs in the family context. In the tradi-
 tional Micronesian extendedfamily unit, spoues and children were accorded strong
 protections from violence, abuse, and neglect. These were deemed offenses against
 the family, not just the individuals, and were dealt with by a complex system of fa-
 milial sanctions. With increasing urbanization and monetarization of th e economy,
 however, increased emphasis has been p laced on the nuclear family, and the tradi-
 tional methods of coping with family discord are breaking down. No government
 agency, including the police, has been successful in replacing that extended family
 system or in addressing the issue of familial violence directly.
 Incidents of both reported and unreported spousal abuse, often of increasing se-
 verity, continue to rise. Effective prosecution of such offenses is rare. In many cases,
 the victim is pressured by family, fear of further assault, or is convinced that the
 police will not actively involve themselves in what is seen as a private, family prob-
 l'em, and decides against pressing legal charges. There are no laws against domestic
 abuse, and there are no governmental or private facilities to shelter and support
 women in abusive situations. There also are a growing number of cases of physical
 and sexual assaults against women outside the family context. These assaults are
 perpetrated against both citizens and foreigners. Unmarried women are sometimes
 considered to have invited such violence by living or traveling alone.
 Women have equal rights under the law, and there are no cultural or institutional
 barriers to education and employment. Women receive equal pay for equal work and
 are well-represented in the lower and middie ranks of government. Women are ac-
 tive and increasingly successful in private business and enterprise. There has been
 a National Womens Advisory Council in existence since 1992, and there are several
 small nongovemen        , groups interested in women's issues, particularly ones asso-
 ciated with spousal ang family violence and abuse.
 Children.-The Government is committed to children's welfare through its pro-
 grams of health care and education, but these have not been adequate to meet the
 needs of the country's sharply growing population in an environment in which the
 extended family is breaking down.
 There is a compulsory education law that requlres that all children begin school
 at the age of 6. Ci dren may leave school w   herey reach the age of 14 or after
 completing the eighth grade, whichever comes first.
 wPeople With Disabilities.-Neither laws nor regulations mandate accessibility to
 public buildings and services for the disabled. Schools have established special edu-
 cation classes to address problems encountered by those who exhibit learning dis-
 abilities, although such classes are completely dependent on outside funding
 SOUrCes.
 NationallRacialEthnie Minorities.--The law prohibits noncitizens from purchas-
 ingland, and the national Congress grants citizenship to non-Micronesians only by
 individual acts (an authority exercised during the year, following a lapse of almost
 20 years). For the most part, however, non-citizens share fully in the social and cul-
 tural life of the country.   v
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Associatior-Under the Bill of Rights, citizens have the right to
 form or join associations, and national government employees by law may form asso-
 ciations to "present their views" to the Government. However, neither associations
 nor trade unions have been formed in this largely nonindustrial society.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Colectively.-There is no law dealing spe-
 cifically with trade unions or with the right to collective bargaining. Individual em-
 ployers, the largest of which are the national and state governments, set wages. The
 Government is not a member of the International Labor Organization.
 
 
 1011
 
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Constitution specifically pro-
 hibits involuntary servitude, and there is no evidence of its practice. Children are
 not specifically cited in this prohibition, but forced and bonded labor by children is
 not known to occur.
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment.-Neither
 the Constitution nor the law specifically prohibits forced and bonded labor by chil-
 dren, but such practices are not known to occur (see Section 6.c.). There is no law
 establishing a minimum age for employment of children. While in practice there is
 no employment of children for wages, they often assist their families in subsistence
 farming activities. There is a compulsory education law that requires that all chil-
 dren begin school at the age of 6. Children may leave school when they reach the
 age of 14 or after completing the eighth grade, whichever comes first.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The four state governments have established
 minimum wage rates for government workers. Pohnpei has a minimum hourly wage
 rate of $2.00 for government and $1.35 for private workers. The other three states
 have established minimum hourly rates only for government workers, $1.25 for
 Chuuk; $1.49 for Kosrae; and $0.80 for Yap. The minimum hourly wage for employ-
 ment with the national Government is $1.68. These minimum wage structures and
 the wages customarily paid to skilled workers are sufficient to provide a decent
 standard of living under local conditions.
 There are no laws regulating hours of work (although a 40-hour workweek is
 standard practice) or prescribing standards of occupational safety and health. A fed-
 eral regulation requires that employers provide a safe workplace. The Department
 of Health has no enforcement capability; working conditions vary in practice.
 Two states permitted foreign laborers in garment manufacturing enterprises. The
 foreign laborers are paid at a lower rate than citizens who work at the factories,
 work longer hours per day, and work a 6-day week in contrast to the 5-day week
 for citizens.
 There is no law for either the public or private sector that would permit workers
 to remove themselves from dangerous work situations without jeopardy to their con-
 tinued employment.
