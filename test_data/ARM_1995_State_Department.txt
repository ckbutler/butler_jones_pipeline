 ARMENIA
 Armenia has a constitutional government in which the President, who won a
 multicandidate election in 1991, appoints and dismisses the Prime Minister, all cab-
 inet ministers, the Prosecutor General, regional governors, and the mayor of
 Yerevan. The new Constitution severely circumscribes the powers of the legislature
 relative to the executive branch. The 190-member National Assembly was chosen in
 July in the first postin d  ence parliamentary elections. Local and international
 observers characterized them as "generally free, but not fair," and cited deficiencies
 in the electoral process, including a lack of transparency mn vote counting, the sus-
 pension of a leading opposition party, and the prevention of 5 opposition parties and
 
 
 762
 over 500 opposition candidates from registering. Manipulation of election procedures
 by the largely progovernment Central Election Commission (CEC) contributed to the
 ruling oalition's 80-percent majority in the new Assembly. The President may dis-
 band the legislature and call for new elections, except during his last 6 months in
 office. The Constitution provides for an independent judiciary; in practice, however,
 judges are subject to political pressure from both the executive and legislature.
 The Ministry of Internal Affairs supervises the national police force, which is re-
 sponsible for maintaining order throughout the country. The Prime Minister over-
 sees the Ministry for National Security, which is responsible for combating both ex-
 ternal and internal threats to the State. The civilian authorities do not maintain
 effective control of all the security forces. Some members of the security forces com-
 mitted serious human rights abuses.
 The Government is committed to a transition to a market economy, despite the
 economic constraints imposed by its conflict with neighboring Azerbabjan. The econ-
 omy continues to experience critical shortages of fuel, electricity, and raw materials,
 which severely restrict industrial production and cause widespread unemployment.
 The economy, nevertheless, registered the first increment of positive growth since
 independence. The Government made some progress toward market reform with
 moves to liberalize bread prices and plans to privatize state structures, including
 large enterprises. Inflation was brought under control and the local currency, the
 dram, was stable. The per capita gross national product is $467 annually.
 Starting with the suspension of a major opposition party, the Armenian Revolu-
 tionary Federation (ARF) or Dashnak party, and its newspapers in December 1994,
 there was a noticeable decline in Armenia s observance of human rights. The Gov-
 ernment hampered the ability of opposition parties and media organs to function
 freely, including before and during the elections. The Government's manipulation of
 the elections and the constitutional referendum, primarily through the CEC, re-
 stricted citizens' ability to change their government. Police brutality goes largely un-
 reported, but evidence indicates that police frequently beat detainees. Lawyers for
 those accused of crimes in connection with the alleged terrorist cell "Dro" claim that
 the defendants were subjected to beatings to extract confessions and were denied
 visits from relatives and lawyers. In March the Prosecutor General issued a ruling
 that denied defense lawyers access to their clients for most of the investigation
 phase of a case. In March and April, defense lawyers were physically attacked. In
 May, a Dro detainee died in a prison hospital while awaiting trial. The Government
 repeatedly denied requests by international organizations and foreign embasssy offi-
 cials to visit the Dro and other detainees and prisoners unescorted. Prison condi-
 tions are poor.
 The Government places some restrictions on freedom of the press, assembly, and
 association. The Armenian law restricts freedom of religion, and societal violence
 against religious minorities is a problem. Armed paramilitary groups carried out a
 wave of attacks on religious minority groups in April and May. The authorities have
 not brought to justice the perpetrators of the attacks, despite government assur-
 ances to the contrary. Discrimination against women and minorities is a problem.
 In an effort to move forward on confidence building measures between the parties
 to the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, the Government released all of its prisoners of
 war and civilian detainees held as a result of the dispute.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and other Extrajudicial Killing.-A detainee in the case of the alleged
 Dro terrorist cell, Artavazd Manukhyan, died in custody on May 15, while awaiting
 trial. There were allegations that he died due to extensive loss of blood and inad-
 equate medical attention; the State claims that Manukhyan died of natural causes
 (see Section 1.c.). In the January 1994 case of eight dead Azerbaijani, some inter-
 national organizations have decided that the cause of death was suicide and the
 Government considers the case closed.
 b. Disappearance.-No abductions by Government or other forces are known to
 have been committed.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution and the law prohibit torture. The authorities charged members of
 the security forces with police brutality in five cases; however, none of the
 defendents has yet gone to trial. Two of the policemen accused of brutality in 1994
 were administratively disciplined, and the third is still awaiting trial for murder.
 The number of eyewitness accounts of police brutality far outstrips the number of
 cases filed, indicating that most cases of police brutality go unreported.
 
 
 763
 The office of the Prosecutor General (Attorney General) investigates allegations of
 mistreatment. If the investigation reveals evidence to support the allegations and
 if there is a serious violation of the law, the prosecutor's office files criminal charges.
 Less serious cases are referred to the Ministry of Internal Affairs for administrative
 action.
 The Government has not improved the prison system, which still uses Soviet-era
 "Kartser," which are outdoor, cement cells where prisoners are often incarcerated
 for weeks at a time, receiving food once every 3 days.
 The Government has not facilitated independent monitoring of prison conditions.
 It has denied requests by foreign embassy officials, the International Committee of
 the Red Cross (ICRC), and others to conduct unescorted visits with detainees ac-
 cused of crimes, and, in some cases, has denied permission for visits altogether. The
 Government has repeatedly denied permission for the ICRC to visit the Dro defend-
 ants, including Artavazd Manukbyan, who was arrested in December 1994 and died
 in prison in May awaiting trial (see Section 1.a.). Manukhyan did not see his lawyer
 for several days before his death nor his family after his arrest. He reportedly had
 requested medical treatment for his delining health since March, but apparently
 did not receive any until May. He allegedly died from extensive blood loss. The gov-
 ernment-appointed panel of physicians that investigated Manukhyan's death
 claimed that he was not tortured and died of heart failure brought on by advanced
 pneumonia. Manukhyan was reportedly healthy at the time of his arrest.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Accordng to the transitional provisions
 of the Constitution, the previous procedure for searches and arrests will be main-
 tained until the Criminal Code is brought into line with the Constitution.
 According to the existing Criminal C-ode, much of which dates from the Soviet era,
 suspects may be detained and held without charge for up to 72 hours. A suspect
 has the right to be represented by a lawyer, and the police must notify the suspect's
 relatives if requested. The latter prvision has been violated regularly, leaving rel-
 atives to rely on rumors as to a detainee's whereabouts. After arrest, the suspect
 may be jailed for up to 6 months pending trial and completion of the investigation,
 or up 'o 11 months by special order of the Prosecutor General (these limits were
 recently extended from 3 months and 9 months, respectively). If no sentence is
 passed during the period of detention, the suspect must be released. There is no pro-
 vision for bail.
 In May the President authorized the release of 47 prisoners of war being held as
 a result of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict.
 There were no reports of forced exile.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-Although the Constitution provides for an inde-
 pendent judiciary, in practice, courts are not independent from the other branches
 of government. The provisions of the new Constitution do not appear designed to
 insulate the courts from political pressure from the executive branch, although ena-
 bling legislation is yet to be enacted and implemented. Under the Constitution, the
 Justice Council appoints and disciplines judges for the new tribunal courts, review
 courts, and the court of appeals. The President heads the council a ppoints 14 mem-
 bers in addition to the Prosecutor General and Justice Minister who are ex officio
 members. This gives the President overwhelming influence in appointing and dis-
 missing judges at all levels.
 According to the transitional provisions of the Constitution, the existing courts
 will retain their powers until the new judicial system is established. The existing
 court system comprises a number of district courts, a supreme court, and a military
 tribunal. District courts try the overwhelming majority of cases. The Ministry of In-
 ternal Affairs continues to conduct preliminary investigations of criminal cases. The
 Soviet-era procedures remain in effect. The judicial structure set out under the new
 Constitution does not provide for a supreme court. The Constitution's transition pro-
 visions extend the powers of members of the current supreme court until the forma-
 tion of the Court of Appeals, up to a maximum of 3 years. The Constitutional
 Court's range of activity is limited by the Constitution. Only the President, one-
 third of Parliament, and candidates for the office of president may appeal to the
 court. The latter may do so only to challenge the results of an election.
 The Constitution provides for jury trials in cases stipulated by law. Implementing
 regulations for this prvision have not yet been adopted. Once criminal or civil
 charges have been filed, the case should by law go to trial within one month. In
 practice, due to court backlogs and other resource problems, the deadline is often
 not met.
 The military tribunal operates essentially as it did in the Soviet era. A military
 prosecutor performs the same functions as his civilian counterpart, operating in ac-
 cordance with the Soviet-era legal code. Trials are public except when government
 secrets are at issue. Defendants are required to attend their trials unless they have
 
 
 764
 been accused of a minor crime not punishable by imprisonment. Defendants may
 confront witnesses and present evidence. The court appoints an attorney for any de-
 fendant who needs one. Defendants have the right of appeal.
 There were no reports of political prisoners. The 1994 case of former National Se-
 curity Advisor Vahan Avakyan was closed. Some human rights organizations had
 called Avakyan the first political prisoner in Armenia. He was sentenced in the fall
 of 1994 to 4 years in prison, charged with attempting to steal state secrets. On Sep-
 tember 11, the President granted Avakyan amnesty and released him from prison.
 The Dro trials began on August 7. Eleven defendants are accused of being mem-
 bers of the so-called Dro clandestine organization, and are accused of terrorism, ille-
 gal economic activities,drug trafficking, homicide, and the recruitment and training
 of new Dro members. Tnhe first stage, the testimony of the defendants, ran until No-
 vember 20. Seven of the accused claimed that their testimony was coerced through
 psychological pressure and torture. Four of the defendants refused to testify m
 court. The second stage, examining of the witnesses, ran through the first week of
 December. There were 21 witnesses to be questioned, but 10 witnesses could not be
 located. The third stage, the presentation of evidence by the prosecution, including
 police reports, arrest warrants, letters, official documents, and fingerprints ran until
 December 25. The only evidence not presented was an analysis of controversial com-
 puter diskettes confiscated from the apartment and office of Gagik Artsrouni, one
 of the key defendants. Local human rights groups have accused the court of not
 being balanced. They say the judge has ignored protests from the defense attorneys
 that evidence was collected illegally and tampered with by the police and the pros-
 ecutor's office. Observers of the proceedings point to numerous procedural oddities.
 Thus, the view of most observers is that the court places more emphasis on the gov-
 ernment's political objectives in the trial than due process consideration for the ac-
 cused.
 The trial of Vahan Hovhanissyan, a member of the Dashnaks party leadership
 council, is scheduled to begin in March 1996. He was detained on July 29 for "rou-
 tine questioning," but was denied access to a defense lawyer until August 10.
 Hovhanissyan has been charged with high treason, terrorism, conspiring to over-
 throw the Government, and illegal possession of arms. His defense team has alleged
 numerous infractions of the law during the investigation period. His attorneys claim
 that they were given only 2 days to investigate evidence. They also claim that his
 place of detention was kept a secret from them for 2 weeks.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution provides for the right to privacy for citizens, their residences, their
 communications, and their correspondence. Procedurally, the security ministries
 must petition the prosecutor's office for permission to tap a telephone or intercept
 correspondence. The prosecutor's office purportedly must find a compelling need for
 the wiretap before it will grant the agency permission to proceed.
 There were many violations of the right to privacy during waves of army conscrip-
 tion in 1995. Military recruiters appeared at houses where draft-age men were re-
 ported to live, and either threatened the occupants or inflicted material damage. Re-
 cruiters seized draft-age men in public at markets and on the subway. There are
 credible reports that Armenian and Nagorno-Karabakh officials forcibly conscripted
 refugees from Nagorno-Karabakh and Azerbaijan. The draft board also sent recruit-
 ers to Krasnodar Kray in Russia to retrieve draft-age males who had fled the coun-
 try.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of the
 press. In practice, however, the Government has, on occasion, shown intolerance of
 newspapers critical of government policies. Freedom of the press was partially re-
 stricted in December 1994, when the Government shut down four Dashnak-affiliated
 newspapers, as well as eight other media outlets with Dashnak party members in
 key positions. Ten of these remain closed. Independent and opposition newspapers,
 most of which have extremely few resources, are dependent on the Government for
 newsprint and publication facilities-an arrangement that has continued intact from
 the Soviet period. Newsprint is sold at various prices depending on the purchaser,
 and, at times, is completely unavailable to opposition papers. Golos Armeni and a
 few other independent newspapers have stopped publishing because of paper short-
 ages and financial problems. Several media correspondents were physically attacked
 and offices of several newspapers were firebombed. No suspects have been arrested
 in any of these cases.
 Despite these hardships, opposition newspapers have continued to publish and
 *rnt articles critical of the Government. There is no prepublication censorship.
 fiowever, the Government supplies all mass media editors with a list of forbidden
 
 
 765
 subjects, most of which relate to the military. There were no reports of prosecutions
 for violations of this injunction.
 Broadcasting is largely controlled by the Government. There is one functioning
 independent radio station. There are lso several small independent cable television
 companies which are only licensed to show films.
 State television provided a total of 5 minutes per candidate and 30 minutespr
 party of free airtime during the parliamentary elections. In contrast, the ruling  -
 public" bloc, through its control of the media, used scheduled programs to publicize
 its candidates and implored voters to choose Republic at the polls. Part of the Presi-
 dent's spech in support of the Republic bloc was shown on election day, in violation
 of the electoral law. Exhortations to vote "yes" on the constitutional referendum ap-
 peared frequently on state television in the weeks before the vote. The shortage of
 electricity limited broadcast time for programming to about 3 hours per day.
 Generally, there is more freedom in academic institutions than was the case dur-
 ing the Soviet period. Instructors and students express their opinions during lec-
 tures and seminars. There is no official censorship or ideological framework imposed
 upon them. Bribes for good grades reportedly are common.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 freedom of peaceful assembly and association. However, in December 1994, the Gov-
 ernment suspended the Dashnak pary by presidential decree alleging that the
 party harbored a secret terrorist cellDro, %at represented a clear and present dan-
 ger to the Armenian State. The Supreme Court subsequently upheld the President's
 decision to suspend the party for 6 months, on the grounds that the presence of ex-
 patriate members on its ruling bodies violated the law on public political organiza-
 tions. The Dashnak party was not allowed to register for the parliamentary elec-
 tions, although members were allowed to run as individuals in single mandate dis-
 tricts. In June the court extended the ban on Dashnak party activities for 1 more
 year. The court held that the Dashnak party charter continued to violate the law
 on parties.
 Simultaneous with the suspension of the Dashnak party, the offices of the Union
 of Constitutional Rights, which was located in the same building as the Dashnaks,
 were sealed. After protests, the Government provided alternative temporary office
 space so that the Union could continue its work. Other political parties were sub-
 jected to pressure prior to the July parliamentary elections. The authorities accused
 several leaders of the National Democratic Union party of plotting to overthrow the
 State and summoned them to appear for questioning. The Government did not fol-
 low through on these accusations and question these persons.
 Public demonstrations, meetings, and marches occurred frequently, usually with-
 out any interference by the authorities. Howevcr, a significant instance of govern-
 ment interference occurred in June, when several hundred people belonging to oppo-
 sition parties assembled to protest the electoral commission s decision not to register
 a number of opposition parties and over 500 opposition candidates for the July par-
 liamentary elections. About 40 paramilitary troops equipped with guns and
 handheld radios broke up the meeting and beat some of the protesters. Some troops
 said that they belonged to "Yerkrapah," a veterans' organization which reportedy
 is affiliated with government security agencies. Some opposition protesters were ar-
 rested by militia troops. The authorities took no actions against the paramilitary
 forces or those who directed them.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for the right to practice the re-
 ligion of one's choice. In practice, however, the law impses restrictions on religious
 freedom, and the right to freedom of conscience is not adequately protected. The Ar-
 menian Orthodox Church clergy is known to resent the inroads made by
 nonapostolic religions in recent years.
 The 1991 Law on Religious Organizations establishes the separation of church
 and state, but recognizes the Armenian Apostolic Church (the Armenian Orthodox
 Church), to which over 50 percent of the population at least nominally belongs, as
 having special status. The  w forbids proselytizing and requires all nonapostolic
 religious denominations and organizations to register with the Ministry of Justice.
 Petitioning organizations must "e free from materialism and of a purely spiritual
 nature" and must subscribe to a doctrine based on "historically recognized holy
 scriptures." A presidential decree issued in 1993 supplemented the 1991 law and
 strengthened the position of the Armenian Apostolic Church. The decree enjoins the
 Council on Religious Affairs to investigate the activities of the representatives of
 registered religious organizations and to ban missionaries who engage in activities
 contrary to their status.
 A religious organization refused registration cannot publish a newspaper or maga-
 zine, rent a meeting place, have its own program on television or radio, or officially
 
 
 766
 sponsor the visas of visitors to Armenia. Several nonapostolic religious organizations
 have been denied registration by the Ministry of Justice.
 In April paramilitary troops reportedly belonging to the Yerkrapah veterans' orga-
 nization, whose actions reportedly were cleared by high-level government officials,
 staged a series of attacks against members of a dozen nonapostolic religious groups.
 Services were broken up by paramilitary troops wielding iron pipes and guns, pas-
 tors and adherents were beaten and kidnaped, and offices were ransacked and
 equipment stolen. Several victims were rushed to the hospital. About 20 adherents
 were held for several days or weeks at a military police facility before being re-
 leased. When asked why they were being held, the commandant told the detainees
 that it was because of their religious beliefs. The attacks were tacitly abetted by
 months of articles critical of the groups in both the official and nonofficial press. De-
 spite the Government's pledge to apprehend the perpetrators of these attacks and
 despite numerous eyewitness accounts, to date the authorities have made no arrests
 in these cases.
 d. Freedom of Movement within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Constitution provides for freedom of movement within the country,
 foreign travel, emigration, and repatriation, but places restrictions on some of these
 rights. According to informed estimates, up to one-third of Armenia's population has
 temporarily or permanently emigrated during the last 6 years. Passports are denied
 to persons lacking invitations from the country that they wish to visit, those pos-
 sessing state secrets, and those whose relatives have made financial claims against
 them. The Soviet-era Office of Visas and Registrations continues to impede travel
 and emigration through delays and the creation of various bureaucratic obstacles,
 including a requirement for "exit permission."
 Virtually the entire ethnic Azeri population of Armenia prior to independence-
 some 200,000 people-remain refugees in Azerbaijan. After the 1988-89 anti-Arme-
 nian pogroms in Azerbaijan connected with the conflict over control of Nagorno-
 Karabakh, these people were subjected to discrimination and intimidation, often ac-
 companied by violence intended to drive them from the country. Of the 400,000 eth-
 nic Armenian refugees who fled Azerbaijan, less than 50,000 have settled in Arme-
 mia.
 According to the Constitution, the President has the power to grant political asy-
 lum. No laws on refugees have been passed by Parliament and the status of refu-
 gees has not been accepted yet. Existing programs and regulations are all based on
 executive orders. Currently, there is a five-year state program on refugees (1994-
 99). The program's goal is to help the refugees integrate into the community. This
 program dealo exclusively with refugees of Armeman nationality who have fled
 states in the region.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The Government's manipulation of the parliamentary elections and the constitu-
 tional referendum restricted the ability of citizens to choose and change the laws
 and officials that govern them.
 Local and international observers described the national parliamentary elections
 in July as "generally free, but not fair." The Central Electoral Commission (CEC)
 and the regional electoral commissions that administered the elections and the con-
 stitutional referendum were stacked with ruling party loyalists. In addition to the
 Government's suspension of the Dashnak party, the CEC used an ambiguous elec-
 toral law to deny registration to several other opposition parties or blocs and over
 500 opposition candidates on minor technicalities. The CEC ruled on many cases
 shortly before election day, thereby denying some candidates a fair chance to appeal
 the CEC's decision. The Government also used its monopoly of the media to devote
 extensive coverage to a campaign to adopt the draft constitution and deny equal
 time to dissenting views. Opposition parties had limited access to government
 media, and media coverage of the constitutional referendum options was skewed. On
 the positive side, the electorate actively participated in the polling. Several opposi-
 tion parties did mount credible campaigns and were able to seat some deputies in
 the new Parliament.
 Local and international observers expressed concern about outdated voter re-
 istration lists, voter intimidation in some districts, poor ballot security, and the lac
 of transparency during the final vote count by the CEC. The subcommittees of the
 CEC that counted the votes on the constitutional referendum comprised only rep-
 resentatives of the progovernment parties; all opposition members of the CEC were
 assigned to a separate subcommittee that was dispatched to outlying regions, and
 were not able to return to Yerevan when the session to count referendum votes was
 
 
 767
 suddenly announced. Also, the progovernment majority on the CEC regularly voted
 down opposition a ppeals concerning the fairness of the voting.
 In general, localand international observers had good access to polling sites, and
 local election officials made conscientious efforts to adhere to proper polling proce.
 dures. Registered opposition parties and candidates were given limited free access
 to government media and some were able to mount credible campaigns. Some
 Dashnak party members were allowed to run as independent candidates.
 Under the new Constitution, the President appoints the Prime Minister and has
 considerable influence in appointn judges. The Constitution provides for independ-
 ent legislative and judicial branches, but in practice these branches are not insu-
 lated from political pressure from the executive branch. The Constitution gives local
 communities the right to elect local authorities, but stipulates that the Government
 apints regional governors, and the President appoints the Mayor of Yerevan.
 tfder the transitional prvisions of the Constitution, the Parliament (National As-
 sembly), has the right to express no confidence in the heads of city and regional
 ouncils, until a law on local governance is adopted.
 The National Assembly is to operate as a part-time institution for the duration
 of its first term. Approximately one-third of the parliamentarians have been des-
 ignated full-time deputies. Parliament also has a truncated work schedule for its
 first term. Sessions may be called, but may not last more than 6 days.
 Women and minorities play a very limited role in government and politics, largely
 due to traditional social attitudes. There are no women or minorities in cabinet-level
 positions, and only 12 of the 190 deputies in the Parliament are women. Out of the
 rliament's six ommittees, the Committee on Health, Social Security, and Envi-
 ronment is headed by a woman.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vest igation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 There are several fledgling nongovernmental human rights organizations. The
 Government generally does not impede investigaT    onstit   tion  g ions of
 human rights y either local or international human rights organizations, but it has
 impeded independent monitoring of prison conditions. The Government did not ce-
 operate with the ICR  in the case of Artavazd Manukhyan (see Section Lc..
 The Government granted the ICRC access to all prisoners of war and civilian de-
 tainees held in the Nagorn Kara   conflict.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 Discrimination based on race, sex, religion, disability, language, or social status
 is prohibited by the Constitution, but cultural and economic factors prevent women,
 ethnic and religious minorities, and persons with disabilities from participating fully
 in public life.
 Women -In 1995 25 rape cases were opened, but statistics are not yet available
 on the number of convictions. It is virtually certain that many more incidents go
 unreported. No charges of spouse abus  re w i fiaed.
 Armenia remains a male-dominated society. In the workplace, women are gen-
 erally not afforded the opportunities for training and advancement given to men.
 The 1992 law on employment prohibits discrimination in employment, but the ex-
 tremely high unemployment rate makes it difficult to gauge how effectively the law
 has been implemented to prevent discrimination.
 Children.-The Government does not have the economic means to provide fully
 for the welfare of children. The Government focuses its efforts on children's rights
 and welfare on measures to insulate large families--four or more children-from the
 effects of the country's current difficult circumstances. The Government similarly
 targets foreign humanitarian aid proram at large families. The family tradition
 in Armenia is strong, and child abuse does not appear to be a serious problem.
 People With Disabiities.-There is no discrimination against disabled persons in
 employment, education, or in the provision of other state services. The Constitution
 provides for the right to social security in the event of disability. The 1993 Law on
 Invalids provides for the social, political, and individual rights of the disabled, but
 does not mandate the provision of accessibility for the disabled. The Government's
 enforcement of the rights of the disabled remains rudimentary.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-The Government does not discriminate
 against the small communities of Russians, Jews, Kurds, Yezids, Georgians, Greeks,
 and Assyrians in employment, housing, and health services. The Constitution grants
 national minorities the right to preserve their cultural traditions and language, and
 a 1992 law on language provides linguistic minorities with the right to publish and
 study in their native language. There are publications imnorty languages, but
 
 
 the Government has not devoted sufficient resources to organizing minority lan-
 guage schools. In practice, virtually everyone, including members of the Yezid,
 Greek, and Jewish communities, speaks Armenian.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution provides employees with the right
 to form and join trade unions and the right to strike. The Constitution stipulates,
 however, that the right to form associations-including political parties and trade
 unions-may be limited with respect to persons serving in the armed services and
 law enforcement agencies. A January 1993 presidential decree prohibits the Govern-
 ment and other employers from retaliating against strikers and labor leaders. In
 practice, labor organizations remain weak due to high unemployment and stalled in-
 dustry. Unions are free to affiliate with international organizations.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Collective bargaining is not
 practiced. The Government sets wages, and the Constitution provides all citizens
 with the right to a just wage no lower than the minimum set by the Government.
 Although the 1992 Law on Employment provides for the right to organize and bar-
 gain collectively, voluntary and direct negotiations do not take place between unions
 and employers without the participation of the Government b-ecause nearly all en-
 terprises, factories, and organizations remain under state control.
 The Government encourages profitable factories to establish their own pay scales.
 Factory directorates generally set the pay scales, without consultation with employ-
 ees., Wage and other labor disputes are adjudicated through the Arbitration Court.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Constitution and the 1992
 Law on Employment prohibit forced labor, and it is not practiced. This provision is
 enforced by the local councils of deputies, unemployment offices, and, as a final
 board of appeal, the Arbitration Commission.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-Child labor is not practiced. Ac-
 -cording to the 1992 Law on Employment, 16 years is the minimum age for employ-
 ment. Children may work from age 14 with the permission of a medical commission
 and the relevant labor union board. The Law on Employment is enforced by the
 local councils of deputies, unemployment offices, and, as a final board of appeal, the
 Arbitration Commission.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The Government sets the minimum wage by
 decree. In May the daily national minimum wage was set at $1.30 (540 drams) per
 month. The standard legal workweek is 41 hours.
 Given the cost of living, employees paid the minimum wage cannot support either
 themselves or their families on their pay alone. The overwhelming majority of Ar-
 menians live below the officially recognized poverty level as a result of the economic
 dislocations caused by the breakup of the Soviet Union, the 1988 earthquake, the
 conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh, andthe resulting blockade and disruptions in trade.
 The vast majority of enterprises are either idle or operating at only a fraction of
 their capacity. Those still on the payrolls of idle enterprises continue to receive two-
 thirds of their base salary.
 The Constitution provides citizens with the right to clean and safe work places,
 but Soviet-era occupational and safety standards remain in force. Labor legislation
 from 1988 places responsibility on the employer and the management of each firm
 to ensure "healthy and normal" labor conditions for employees, but it provides no
 definition of "healthy and normal." Workers cannot remove themselves from hazard-
 ous conditions without risk of loss of employment.
