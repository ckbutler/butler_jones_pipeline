 DJIBOUTI
 Djibouti is one of Africa's newest independent states. Following
 legislation passed in late 1981 effectively outlawing opposition
 political parties, Djibouti formally became a one-party state
 under the ruling Popular Assembly Party. All legal political
 expression can now only be through the party. Shortly before
 Djibouti became a one-party state, 13 dissidents were imprisoned
 for attempting to found an opposition party, the Popular Party of
 Djibouti. All were released by early 1982. One of those dissi-
 dents and another suspected opposition party leader were detained
 again briefly in October 1982, following their appearance in a
 French television program critical of the Government of Djibouti.
 In May 1982, elections for the National Assembly were held, and
 the single slate of candidates that appeared on the ballot was
 elected without opposition. There were charges, however, of
 manipulation of the voter registration rolls to reduce repre-
 sentation from areas of potential opposition.
 Politically the country is divided among: (1) the ethnic Somalis,
 who have a slight majority in the population and in turn are
 subdivided into clans and factions thereof; (2) a strong minority
 of Afars, who have lost their previous position of dominance
 and now fear permanent exclusion from power; and (3) Arabs,
 mainly Yemenis.
 Nominally, political power is shared by an arrangement in which
 the President is Somali and the Premier an Afar, with cabinet
 positions roughly divided equally. Afar leaders and some others
 feel that real power is nevertheless in the hands of the Somalis
 of the Issa clan, who increasingly control the Government, the
 civil service, the armed forces, and the party, making it diffi-
 cult for others to gain a share of power.
 Despite its meager resources, Djibouti has continued to host
 some 30,000 refugees from Ethiopia and Somalia and allow inter-
 national relief agencies to operate in refugee camps. The
 Government has generally treated refugees well and in compliance
 with accepted international norms; Djibouti is a party to both
 the 1951 Convention and the 1967 Protocols relating to the
 status of refugees. In February 1982, however, the Government
 forcibly returned to Ethiopia at least 35 legitimate refugees
 after a roundup of illegal immigrants. After protests by the
 United States and other Governments and the UN High Commission
 for Refugees, the-Government agreed to stop this practice, and
 it has not been repeated.
 The Djiboutian legal system is still in its formative stages.
 No further sections of the first Constitution for Djibouti, the
 first parts of which were introduced in 1981, have been issued.
 On any topic not yet covered by Djiboutian legislation, the
 Napoleonic code, a product of the French colonial period, and,
 to an extent, the Koran-based Sharia, generally apply. There
 have been several allegations of both harassment of political
 opposition leaders and torture of political opponents. There
 was an independent confirmation of these charges in 1980,
 followed by a commitment by Djibouti's President Hassan Gouled
 to eliminate this practice.
 Djibouti has no known exploitable resources. It has a service-
 oriented economy based on its port, airport, and the rail line
 to Ethiopia. The major focus of its Government is on economic
 development. The latter is intrinsically tied to economic
 assistance from other countries. Unemployment and underemploy-
 ment remain major problems.
 
 
 In both the short and long term, the human riqhts situation will
 continue much as at present, with a qeneral respect for interna-
 tional standards of conduct within the framework of a one-party
 state.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Killinq
 There has been only one incident of killing for apparent politi-
 cal motives since Djibouti became independent in 1977; in Decem-
 ber 1981 the reputed leader of a Somali dissident group was
 assassinated in Djibouti City. The Djiboutian Government sub-
 sequently arrested several individuals for their role in the
 killing. The Government seems willing and able to prevent or
 punish killings by security, military, or political forces under
 its control.
 b. Disappearance
 No allegations of disappearances are known to have been made.
 c. Torture
 On September 8, 1982, in a television program produced in France
 entitled "Djibouti: Republic in Uniform," former Prime Minister
 Ahmed Dini reiterated charges he and others had made several
 times in past years that political prisoners were being systemat-
 ically tortured in Djibouti. In the past the Government had
 denied such charges, but in 1980 a delegate from Amnesty Inter-
 national visited Djibouti by Government invitation to investigate
 charges of torture and death from torture. The deleqate reported
 a pattern of torture in security and politically motivated cases.
 He met with President Hassan Gouled to discuss the situation, and
 received assurances that the president would undertake to elimi-
 nate the use of torture. Other than the allegations mentioned
 in the above-mentioned program, there were no reports of torture
 in 1982.
 d. Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 There were no allegations of cruel, inhuman, or degrading treat-
 ment or punishment in 1982, aside from the charges of torture
 made in the French television program. Prison conditions are
 said to be adequate. Family members and counsel are permitted
 access to prisoners, and public health and medical services
 supervise health conditions in a generally competent manner.
 e. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 The current system of justice is a carry-over from the French
 colonial period and is a mixture of French and Islamic practice.
 There is no habeas corpus, and preventive detention is permitted.
 However, prosecutors are required to, and generally do, file
 charges in an expedient fashion. The most recent major example
 of arbitrary arrest and imprisonment was the detention of 13
 political dissidents in 1981. All were released by early 1982,
 but in October 1982 one of these dissidents and another suspected
 supporter were detained briefly following their appearance in the
 French television proqram discussed in Section Ic.
 f. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 
 
 87
 Both the state security court, which was established to deal with
 crimes against the security of the state, and ordinary civil and
 criminal courts permit family members and counsel, though not the
 general public, to be present during trials. The judiciary is
 generally independent of military and executive pressures.
 g. Invasion of the Home
 The judiciary issues search warrants to the police. There have
 been no charges of warrantless searches during 1982. During
 1981 there were charges of warrantless searches stemming from
 the detention of the 13 political dissidents.
 2. Respect for Civil and Political Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 All Djiboutian media are Government-owned and support the Govern-
 ment and its policies. There is occasional criticism of the
 shortcomings of local institutions and corrupt practices. There
 have been removals from public distribution of foreign media
 which contained commentary critical of the Government. Whereas
 political opponents were imprisoned in 1981 for making anti-
 Government remarks and attempting to form an opposition party,
 they were all released by early 1982. Subsequently, one of them
 has reiterated these remarks on French television, and still is
 free from detention at the present time.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Public meetings require a permit that may be denied for security
 reasons. The Government has organized a national labor federa-
 tion under its control. However, the right of labor to organize
 and strike is respected. There were some minor strikes in 1982.
 Only a small portion of the work force is unionized. Unions are
 able to maintain relations with recognized international bodies
 in their fields.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Over 90 percent of the population is Muslim, but all religions
 are permitted to operate freely.
 d. Freedom of Movement within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Djiboutians have and exercise the riqht to travel freely within,
 and to leave and return to their country. Passports are avail-
 able, but charges have been made that bribes are sometimes
 required to expedite issuance. In spite of its weak economy and
 meager resources, Djibouti has received approximately 30,000
 refugees, mostly Ethiopian, into the country, and has allowed
 international relief agencies to operate in the two major
 refugee camps. All refugees have the right to live in the
 refugee camps and to receive basic food and medical care.
 Refugees are generally restricted to their camps and do not seem
 to be permitted to move freely.
 In February 1982, following a series of roundups of alleged
 illegal immigrants, approximately 35 refugees were deported to
 Ethiopia. The Djiboutian Government claimed at the time that
 the deportation was an attempt to rid the country of illegal
 aliens posing as legitimate refugees. However, almost half of
 those deported were in fact legitimate refugees, who at the time
 could only provide photo copies of their refugee identity cards
 to the police. During the same period, approximately 100 Somali
 
 
 88
 citizens without legal documentation were taken to that nation's
 borders. When they were not accepted by Somali authorities,
 however, they were permitted to return. Protests were made by
 the UNHCR concerning the forcible repatriation of the Ethiopian
 refugees, some of whom later returned to Djibouti without inci-
 dent. The Government's current policy is to encourage all
 refugees to move to refugee camps in the short term, and in
 the long term to return to their country of origin.
 e. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Political participation is legally possible only through the
 sole legal party, the RPP. President Gouled holds effective
 power within both the party and the Government. In August 1981
 an opposition party attempted to gain legal recognition to
 participate in National Assembly elections scheduled for May
 1982. Despite extensive publicity in the international press,
 the Government refused to grant the proposed party legal recogni-
 tion and took steps to institute a single party political system.
 Later, 13 leaders of the opposition group were detained, with
 the Government maintaining these dissidents were attempting to
 encourage inter-ethnic strife which would have torn the country
 apart. The Government's actions led to charges that there is no
 democratic or non-violent means of opposition for those who
 oppose the present Government. These charges were echoed before
 the National Assembly elections in May 1982, when opponents of
 the Government charged it had manipulated voting district regis-
 stration rolls to reduce the influence of regions where the
 dissidents were strong. Over 90 percent of the reported regis-
 tered voters voted in the May elections, with less than two
 percent submitting a blank paper or writing the word *no' on the
 ballot. There were reports of minor scattered violence on
 election day, as well as some coercion of voters.
 Traditionally the Djiboutian Government has attempted, usually
 successfully, to include in the ruling cabinet representatives of
 all of the nation's important ethnic groups. At present there
 are no significant minority groups not represented in the Govern-
 ment or denied a political role within the limits of the current
 political system. However, the Afars, and some other critics,
 complain that the country is run by and for the Somali Issas,
 who dominate the Government, the armed forces, and the single
 party.
 Women legally have equal political rights with men, but have
 not played an active role in politics. There are currently
 no female parliamentarians or senior Government officials.
 3. Government Attitude Regarding International and Non-
 governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations of
 Human Rights
 On at least five occasions since independence, most recently in
 September 1982, there have been foreign press reports alleging
 human rights violations by the Government. The only known re-
 quest by an international 6rganization to conduct a human rights
 investigation came from the United Nations High Commissioner for
 Refugees in 1981. The Government cooperated with a delegate
 from Amnesty International who visited Djibouti in 1981 to
 investigate charges of torture and death from torture. The
 results of his visit are described in Section ic above. Amnesty
 International was also concerned about detention, without charge
 or trial, of political prisoners.
 4. Economic, Social, and Cultural Situation
 
 
 89
 Djibouti is one of the world's least developed countries and is
 almost totally lackinq in natural resources. It is heavily
 dependent on the maintenance of a large French military and
 expatriate presence and outside donor support, mainly from
 France and Saudi Arabia, for its economic development. This
 support is directed toward many aspects of the economy, includ-
 ing education and health facilities, and is designed to ameli-
 orate the high poverty level in the country. Since there has
 not been a census since 1961 in Djibouti, it is difficult to
 establish a useful data base from which meaningful statistics
 can be derived.
 The harsh, hot environment in the Republic of Djibouti is one of
 the causes of the low life expectancy of 50 years (1973 sta-
 tistics) and the high infant mortality rate (variously estimated
 as between 32 and 114 per 1,000). There is almost no viable
 agricultural potential, and the only large-scale source of
 locally-produced food is fish. The Government has encouraged
 the population to supplement their diets with fish, and this
 program has met with some success. There are no figures avail-
 able on the amount of calorie supply relative to nutritional
 requirements, but estimates are lower than 100 percent.
 Water is a scarce commodity in most of the country, and there are
 no surface water sources. The Government has made efforts to
 truck water to the more remote areas of the country. An African
 Development Fund study of September 1979 estimated 41 percent of
 the population received safe water (53 percent in urban areas, 20
 percent in rural areas). Active assistance efforts to identify
 and to utilize further water source and storage areas are cur-
 rently under way.
 According to a November 1980 World Bank report, the adult litera-
 cy rate in the French language was 17 percent. The primary
 school enrollment was approximately 20,000 in 1982, an increase
 of 300 percent since independence in 1977. The high school
 enrollment has increased from 3,000 to 8,000 during the same
 period. This increase, with a concomitant rise in the number
 and quality of educational facilities, reflects the high priority
 the Djiboutian Government gives to education.
 According to World Bank figures of 1980, the gross national
 product of Djibouti is $480 per capita. This figure is mislead-
 ing, however, given the very high poverty levels in much of the
 country and the large, well-paid, predominantly French expatri-
 ate community, some three percent of the total estimated popula-
 tion of 365,000.
 Almost one-third of the population lives a nomadic life of abject
 poverty in the rural hinterlands of the republic. A United Na-
 tions Development Program report of 1980 states that the Djibouti
 rural population is "probably one of the poorest groups in east-
 ern Africa." The same report notes that "extreme poverty exists
 in urban environments of Djibouti." Two factors other than the
 near total lack of natural resources or economic potential con-
 tribute significantly to the poverty level: First, practically
 all commodities are imported for consumption, and prices of even
 basic staples are extraordinarily high for most of the non-
 expatriate population. Second, there is a high level of unem-
 ployment. A French study of 1980 estimated that 47 percent of
 the population earned less than $85 per annum.
 The latest available International Monetary Fund report (1980)
 confirms Djibouti Ministry of Labor statistics on unemployment,
 showing that more than 50 percent of those seeking employment in
 
 
 90
 1979 could not find work. In 1981 the US Agency for Interna-
 tional Development estimated unemployment at 33 percent and
 underemployment at 50 percent.
