 GEORGIA
 .Georgia declared independence from the Soviet Union in 1991. Multiparty par-
 liamentary elections followed a short-lived military coup in 1992. In Augst 1995,
 Parliament adopted a Constitution that provides for an executive branch that re-
 ports to the President, a legislature, and an independent judiciary. In November
 1995, Eduard Shevardnadze was elected President and a new Parliament was s-
 lected in elections described by international observers as generally consistent with
 democratic norms except in the region of Ajara. The Presdent appoints ministers
 with the consent of the Parliament. The judiciary is subject to executive pressure.
 Internal confficts in Abkhazia and South Ossetia remain unresolved. Thlese con-
 flicts, togethler with problems created by roughy 250,000 internally displaced per-
 sons (IDis), pos the greatest threat to national stability. In 1993 Abkhaz separat-
 ists forcibly took control of Abkhazia, and most ethnic Georgians, a large percentage
 of the population, fled the region. In 1994 Russian peacekeeping forces representing
 The Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) deployed in the conflict area with
 the agreement of the Government and the Abkhaz separatists. Despite thepresence
 of peacekeepers there has been little repatriation  ethnic Georgian IDI's apart
 from some spontaneous returns to the Gali region, where the security situation re-
 mains unstable. A Russian peacekeeping force has been in South Ossetia since June
 1992. Repatriation to South Ossetiahas also been slow. The Government has no ef-
 fective control over either Abkhazia or South Ossetia. There were no large-scale
 armed hostilities in South Ossetia or Abkhazia in 1996, but Abkhaz and Georgian
 armed bands operated in the Galo region.
 The Ministry of Interior (MVD) and Precuracy have primary responsibility for law
 enforement, and the Ministry of State Security MGB formerly KB plays a signifi-
 cant role in internal security. In times of internal disorder, the Government may
 
 
 943
 call on the army. Reformist elected, civilian authorities maintain inadequate control
 of the security forces. The MVD and Procuracy especially committed serious human
 rihts abuses.
 The economy improved, led by gains in trade and services, agriculture, and trans-
 portation. The economy remains primarily agricultural. Foreign aid makes a large
 contribution to the economy. Per capita gross domestic product is estimated at over
 $500.
 The Government continued efforts to improve its human rights record, but signifi-
 cant problems remain. These include police and security force abuse and beating of
 prisoners and detainees, forced confessions, inhumane prison conditions, deaths in
 custody, judicial corruption, denial of fair and expeditious trials, and arbitrary inter-
 ference with privacy and home. Some press freedoms are constrained, the judiciary
 is subject to executive pressure, and discrimination ag   women is a problem.
 There is however a growing awareness on the part of the people of their individual
 rights. he number and variety of independent nongovernmental organizations
 (NGOYs) is growing. The Parliament is more active and reformist than its prede-
 cessor. Independent newspapers show a greater willingness to criticize government
 policies.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial  illing.-n 1996, there was a sharp drop in
 the level of violence due to improved political and social stability. Perpetrators of
 atrocities and other political killings arising from the separatist conflict in the re-
 gion of Abkhazia are not being investigated, prosecuted, or punished. President
 Shevardnadze proposed in 1995 that the United Nations create a body to investigate
 and punish those guilty of crimes against humanity in Abkhazia. The U.N. Observer
 Mission in Georgia (UNOMIG) and the Organization for Security and Cooperation
 in Europe (OSCE) mission in Georgia have sent teams into Abkhazia to investigate
 security incidents and human rights abuses.
 The authorities reported that 13 people died while in pretrial detention, a decline
 from 40 last year. All deaths were officially attributed to medical causes, but phys-
 ical abuse and torture of prisoners also played a role (see Section 1.c.).
 Abkhaz separatist authorities continue to condone violence to discourage the repa-
 triation of ethnic Georgian internally displaced persons to the Gall district. In spite
 of the cessation of large-scale hostilities in 1993 and the presence of peacekeepers,
 there has been little repatriation. About 10 percent of IlDlys and refugees have re-
 turned. A series of politically motivated attacks occurred in Abkhazia directed at ci-
 vilians by both Georgian and Abkhaz armed bands. The most serious occurred on
 January 5. Three young men wearing a mix of military and civilian clothing fatally
 shot eight members of an ethnic Georgian family in Shesheleti, Abkhazia. The
 U.N.'s report characterized the attack as "well-planned, not random, and carried out
 with ruthless efficiency." The identity of the perpetrators remains unknown.
 b. Disappearance.-According to the State Committee on Human Rights and to
 Abkhaz separatist authorities, the fate of over 1,000 Georgians and Abkhaz who
 have disappeared since 1992 as a result of the Abkhaz conflict is still unknown. The
 OSCE reports that the Government has 10 Abkhaz in detention. The Abkhaz au-
 thorities reportedly hold about 24 ethnic Georgians (see Section 1d.). Partisan
 groups active in Abkhazia periodically take hostages. There is some cooperation be-
 tween the two sides on exchange of hostages.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution forbids the use of torture, but serious abuses occur. Members of
 security forces continued, on a routine basis, to beat and abuse prisoners and de-
 tainees. According to Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, there were
 instances of torture and mistreatment, including the use of electric shock. Govern-
 ment officials claim that a lack of proper training and supervision of investigators
 and guards often results in cases of abuse. Corruption and criminality also play a
 role. The most serious incidents of abuse occur in the investigative stage of pretrial
 detention when suspects are interrogated by police. A number of policemen have
 been arrested or disciplined for physical abuse, and five, including the former head
 of the MVD's narcotics unit, were put on trial.
 Members of the Parliamentary Committee on Human Rights and Ethnic Relations
 have independently investigated claims of abuse. In particular the subcommittee on
 prisons has been very active.
 Prison authorities admit that conditions are inhuman in many facilities. They
 blame inadequate cells, medicine, and food on a lack of resources. In the pretrial
 detention facility in Tbilisi for example, 2,050 inmates are housed in a prison de-
 
 
 944
 signed for fewer than 1,000. Cels can contain as many as 36 inmates with so few
 beds that they must sleep in shifts. The lack of pror          edical care, and
 food poses a serious threat to the life and health of prisoners. Tubelosis is a par-
 ticular problem. Government p lans announced in 1995 to build a new pretrial deten-
 tion center remain unfulfilled. The poor condition of prisons is a contributing factor
 to the pretrial detention mortality rate. Thirteen people died in pretrial detention.
 Although officially attributed to medical causes, physical abuse and torture were
 also factors in these deaths.
 Until March the International Committee of the Red Crss (ICRC) had only hin-
 ited access to detainees and prisoners. From March to October, the ICRC found that
 its access improved, but it still had to make several applications and get senior-level
 approval for some visits.
 On October 10, President Shevardnadze issued a decree instructing the Ministers
 of Security, Interior, and the Procuracy to allow ICRC access without obstacle to all
 detainees in all places of detention. The President issued his decree after months
 of unsuccessful negotiations between the ICRC and the ministries to ensure appro-
 priate access. The  ei en's instructions were carried out, and the ICRC had full
 access to detention facilities at yeaas end in accordance with its customary proce-
 dures, which include meetings with the detainees without the presence of third-
 party observers and the regular repetition of visits. This year the ICRC saw 243
 prisoners in Georgian detention, as well as 60 in the custody of Abkhaz separatist
 authorities. Many of these detainees and prisoners were visited repeatedly. The
 OSCE mission and foreign diplomats had some access to detainees and prisoners.
 International human rights monitors have faced obstacles in connection with pris-
 oners arrested in 1995 for alleged involvement in the assassination attempt on
 President Shevardnadze. When eventuallyallowed to meet with some, th. ough not
 all, of these indviduals  government offcials remained in the room. Despite earlier
 assurances of access, thae Procuracy continued to prevent international monitors
 from meeting with several of these detainees. Following the attempted assassination
 of President Shevardnadze, the MVD) arrested dozens of individuals. Many continue
 to be held and officials from the Office of the Prosecutor tried to prevent human
 rights monitors from meeting several of the detainees. At least one of those de-
 tamed, former security service Captain Guram Papukashvili, was beaten severely.
 After several scheduledi meetings_ with Papukashvihl were canceled, officials allowed
 human rights monitors to meet him in March, but not alone. Papukashvili reported
 that since his arrest he had developed kidney problems and coughed up blood. In
 April he onfirmed to his attorney that he had be en beaten. These restctions pre-
 vented independent verification of reports of torture and abuse, denial of medical
 care, and denial of prisoners' access to their attorneys. No appeal nor complaint was
 filed by Papukashvile's attorneys.
 Human rights monitors were also denied permission to see Loti Kobala, Badri
 Zarandia, and other members of the former Gamsakhurdia government on trial for
 hihitreason and other crimes, on the grounds that their cases were ongoing. Court
 officals allowed monitors and journalists to meet defendant Nugzar Molomashi,
 a onetime member of Gamsakhurdia's Supreme Council, after he declared a hunger
 strike that lasted mre than 30 days.
 Colonel Gia Korbesashvili, arrested and severely beaten as a suspect in the July
 1995 attempted bombing of a bridge in Tbiisi, is still under investigation by the
 MVD. The case is in the Tbiisi city court, but the trial has not yet started. The
 Office of the Human Rights Defender created in 1995 is not yet functioning (see Sec-
 tion 1.d.).
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.sThe Constitution provides for a 9-month
 period of maximum pretrial detention, mandated court approval of detention after
 72 hours, and restrictions on the roe of the prosecutor (see Section 1.e.). These safe-
 Zards are not yet in force and not observed. A new Criminal Code, which will bring
 into force the constitutionally mandated restrictions on the powers of the Procuracy
 and the police, is scheduled to be introduced in Parliament by the end of the first
 quarter of 1997 (see Section i.e.). The Criminal Code of the former Georgian Soviet
 Socili  Republc continues to be used by a law enforcement and ourt system that
 has been slow to adapt to democratic norms. Under Soviet law, prosecutors issued
 warrants for arrests and searches without court approval. Persons could be legally
 detained for up to 72 hours without charge. After 72 hours, the prosecutor was re-
 quired to approve the detention. However, this approval was often a formality as
 it was normally the prosecutor who initiated the arrest in the first place. The law
 allowed for a maximum of 18 months of detention before trial. In practice even these
 provisions are frequently violated. Virtually no means are available for accused indi-
 viduals to present their cases to a judge prior to trial. This effectively means that
 pretrial detention is at the discretion of the prosecutor.
 
 
 945
 Persons detained on suspicion of involvement in the attempted assassination of
 President Shevardnadze in August 1995 have been held without trial for 15 months
 and no trial dates have been set. In a separate case, Giorgi Korbesashvili was ar-
 rested in July 1995, beaten several times, denied access to an attorney of his choos-
 ing for seven months, and not told of the charges against him. He continues to await
 trail on charges of plotting to blow up a bridge in Tbilisi (see Section 1.c.).
 On August 7, police arrested Eldar Gogoladze, a colonel in the State Security
 Service, on suspicion of weapons possession. At the time of his arrest, Gooladze
 had a permit to carry a weapon. Police searched Gogoladze's home 10 days after his
 arrest and found no weapons, but continued to press charges. Gogoladze was re-
 leased from pretrial detention in November on grounds of insufficient evidence.
 However, the'rcuracy has made no decision on dropping the charges.
 Nikolay Plosbkin, held by the authorities for 3 years in pretrial detention, was
 released on May 2 after having been tried and found guilty on the charge of conceal-
 ing a crime. He received a sentence of 22 years and was released based on time
 already served.
 There were no cases of forced exile.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution provides for an independent judi-
 ciary. Prior to adoption of the Constitution, the courts were often influenced by pres-
 sure from the executive branch. This pattern continues with judicial authorities fre-
 quently deferring to the executive branch, particularly at lower levels of the court
 system.
 The court system is divided into three levels. At the lowest level are district
 courts, which hear both routine criminal and civil cases. City courts, the next level,
 serve as appellate courts for the district ourts, reviewing cases and either confirm-
 ing verdicts or returning the case to the lower court for retrial. City courts also try
 in the first instance major criminal cases. The Supreme Court, the highest level,
 acts as an appellate court. Parliament approved the creation of a Constitutional
 Court this year, which is now operating.
 A new Criminal Code is due to be considered by Parliament by year's end. In its
 drat form, it is dsigned to reduce the pervasive powers of the Procuracy (see Sec-
 tion 1.d). A separate draft law to reorganize and reduce the power of the Procuracy
 was being debated in Parliament at year's end. Currently Soviet law continues to
 be used. Under Soviet law prosecutors are vested with powers greater than those
 of judges and defense attorneys. Prosecutors direct criminal investigations, super-
 vise some judicial functions, and represent the State in trials. Trials are not con-
 ducted in an adversarial manner. Prosecutors continued to wield disproportionate
 influence over outcomes.
 According to the Constitution, a detainee is presumed innocent and has the right
 to a public trial. A detainee has the right to demand immediate access to a lawyer
 and to refuse to make a statement in the absence of counsel. The detaining officer
 must inform the detainee of his or her rights and must notify the detainee's family
 of his or her location as soon as possible. These rights mark a significant departure
 from Soviet legal practice, but they are not observed.
 The State must provide legal counsel if the defendant is unable to afford one. In
 fact the State provided virtually all attorneys as they remain by.and large employ-
 ees of the State. Attorneys are assigned to a case by the Office of Legal Assistance,
 a part of the state-controlled Bar Association, upon the recommendation of the Proc-
 urator's Office. Private attorneys are allowed in criminal and civil cases only with
 the express written approval of the Office of Legal Assistance.
 Human rights observers report widespread judicial incompetence and corruption,
 including the payment of bribs to prosecutors and judges.
 In the trials of Badri Zarandia, Lt Kobalia, and other members of the former
 Gamsakhurdia Government who fought against forces loyal to the Shevardnadze
 Government, the Government consistently violated due process during the investiga-
 tion and trial. Torture, use of forced confessions, denial of legal counsel, and expul-
 sion of defendants from the courtroom took place. On May 7, Zarandia and his co-
 defendants Zviad Sherozia, Gabriel Bendeliani, Karlo Jichonaia, Gurgen Malania
 and Murman Gulua were expelled from court. On June 17, Zarandia was sentenced
 to death after being convicted of high treason, hooliganism, banditry, and other
 crimes. He was told of the sentence in his cell as he had not been permitted to re-
 turn to the courtroom following his expulsion. On November 18, Kobalia was found
 il   and also received the death     sentence. In  a separate   case, Nugzar
 Mooias        a former member of Gamsakhirdia's Supreme Council, was expelled
 from the courtroom on May 21 for "offending the Government" during his trial.
 The two men condemned to death in the 1995 trial of the assassination attempt
 gainst parliamentary deputy Jaba Ioseliani filed appeals, which are still pending.
 e case was marked by procedural irregularities and acts of abuse, forced confes-
 
 
 946
 sions, denial of legal counsel, and expulsion of defendants from the courtroom took
 place.
 Former Member of Parliament and head of the Monarchist Party Temur
 Jhojholiani was sentenced to 4-years imprisonment after being convicted of drug
 possession and assault on a police officer, despite having Parliamentary immunity
 at the time of his arrest in 1995. The judge disregarded the question of whether
 Jhoajholiani's immunity should have excluded the evidence that led to his convic-
 tion. Throughout the trial, the Court refused Jhorjholiani's requests for bail without
 explanation in violation of the Constitution's requirement that judges cite grounds
 for such decisions.
 There are no known political prisoners. Political overtones, however, attended the
 cases of a number of individuals, including Gamsakhurdia supporters and MGB per-
 sonnel, who were tried and sentenced on criminal grounds.
 f. Arbitrry Interference With Privacy, Family,  ome, or Correspondence.-Credi-
 ble reports indicate that government security agencies monitor private telephone
 conversations without couit order. Police aid State tax authorities also enter homes
 and places of work without legal sanction. Police regularly stop and search vehicles
 without probable cause to extort bribes. The high level of unregulated police mis-
 conduct and corruption has undermined public confidence in government, especially
 law enforcement agencies.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution and the 1991 press law pro-
 vide for freedom of the press, but the Government constrains some press freedoms.
 Security and law enforcement authorities attempted to intimidate the press through
 public comments and private meetings.
 Numerous independent newspapers operate and the press increasingly serves as
 a check on government, frequently criticizing the performance of high-level officials.
 However, no independent newspapers have a national audience and most citizens
 get their news from television. The Government finances and controls two news-
 p~apers mid a radio and television network, which have a national audience and re-
 flect official viewpoints.
 The State alo exerts influene over the press in other ways. For example, it owns
 mid operates the major printing faciity. Earier this year, the Government proposed
 to a number of independent newspapers that they centralize their operations and
 accept government assistance. They refused. Independent newspapers and television
 stations are harassed by state tax authorities.
 Rustavi-2, a member station of the fledgling independent television network,
 TNG, for the second successive year encountered government attempts to shut it
 down. In spite of the legal dcision in 1995 that confirmed Rustavi-2's right to
 broadcast television, the Ministry of Communications revoked the station's Hcqnse
 in July and awarded its broadcast channel to a company with strong ties to govern-
 ment officials. Rustavi-2 had been broadcasting in Tbilisi only for a short time, but
 had demonstrated independence. Rustavi-2 appealed the revocation but lost in the
 district court. The subsequent appeal to the Supreme Court was successful. In No-
 vember the Supreme Court overturned the lower court's decision. Other independent
 stations reported pressure by local governments to support them.
 Academic freedom is widely respected.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 these rights, and the Government generally respects them in practice. The Govern-
 ment permits unannounced assembly in four locations in Tbiisi and requires 24-
 hour advance notice for assemblies in other areas. The Government generally grants
 permits for assembly and registration for associations without arbitrary restriction
 or discrimination. Government respect for freedom of assembly is, however limited
 in some cases. On May 26 police, including elite "OMON" troops from the Ministry
 of the Interior, violently broke up a sanctioned assembly of 200 demonstrators,
 rte  of former President Gamsakhurdia.
 eeom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the
 Government respects this right in practice. Georgia has a tradition of religious toler-
 mice. In two separate instances, however, foreign Christian missionaries were ques-
 tioned by poice for eng  I   k in "anti-Christian activities." In one of those instances,
 Orthodox priests urged police to call in the missionaries for questioning. This action
 reflects a growing mistrust on the part of the Georgian Orthedox Church of the ac-
 tivities of missionaries of other denominations, especially evangelicals (see Section
 5). The Georgian Orthodox Church stated publicly that foreign Christian mission-
 aries should onfine their activities to non-hGoan areas.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The 1993 law on migration provides for these rights, and the Govern-
 
 
 947
 ment generally respects them in practice. Registration of an individual's place of
 residence is no longer required. In principle the Government respects the right of
 repatriation, although approximately 270,000 Meskhetian Turks (primarily Muslim),
 who were expelled to Central Asia by Stalin in the 1940's, still face public opposition
 to their return. The Government publicly supported the right of the Meskhetian
 Turks to return but did not develop a mechanism for repatriation, nor identify a
 community willing to accept returnees. The pilot effort to resettle 35-40 Meskhetian
 families proposed in 1995 did not take place. In 1996 the Government granted refu-
 gee status to 120 Meskhetian Turks who came to Georgia as students.
 The 1994 quadripartite agreement (Russia, Georgia, Abkhazia, and the United
 Nations   *g  Cossioner for Refugees) on repatriation in Abkhazia provided for
 the free, safe, and dignified return of displaced persons and refugees to their homes.
 The Abkhaz separatist regime prevented virtually all official repatriation before uni-
 laterally abrogating the agreement in 1994. Over the past 2 years, some 30,000 to
 35,000 of the estimated 250,000 Il)Ps from Abkhazia have returned spontaneously,
 most to the southern part of the Gali District where the Abkhaz militia operate only
 po radically. Returnees continue to face security threats from Abkhaz separatist mi-
 litia, and Abkhaz and Georgian armed bands (see Section L.a.).
 The 1992 ethnic conflict in South Ossetia also created tens of thousands of ethnic
 Georgian IDls. South Ossetian separatists continue to defy OSCE and government
 attempts to repatriate people to their homes.
 At present there is no effective law concerning the settlement of refugees or the
 granting of political asylum in Georgia. Parliament is considering a draft law. Geor-
 gia has so far not acceded to the 1951 Geneva Convention related to refugees. The
 Government has not provided first asylum, both because there are no legal provi-
 sions for it and because the matter has not yet been raised in practical terms.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The Constitution and the 1995 Election Law provide citizens with the right peace-
 fully to change their government. Citizens exercised this right in elections in Octo-
 ber 1992 and November 1995. A democratically elected President and Parliament
 govern most of Georgia. The separatist regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia are
 ruled by undemocratic leaders. T.n addition the region of Ajara is to a large extent
 self-overning, under conditions resembling a police state. Ajara's postindependence
 relationship to the rest of Georgia is still undetermined and in matters, such as
 elections, Ajara's authorities claim that regional laws take precedence over national
 laws. The Government does not challenge illegal, undemocratic activity by the
 Ajaran authorities, purportedly because Thiisi seeksa to avoid open separatism in
 ethnic Georgian, historically Muslim region. Ajara held regional elections on
 September 22 and denied requests from international as well as Georgian organiza-
 tions to monitor the elections. In the September election, the Ajaran authorites em-
 ployed fraud and intimidation to ensure the victory of the local ruling party. In ad-
 dition the most serious violations noted during the 1995 national elections occurred
 in Ajara.
 The 223-member Parliament and President Eduard Shevardnadze were elected in
 multiparty elections in 1995. Despite some violations, international observers judged
 these elections to meet international standards, except in Ajara. There was no vot-
 ing in the separatist regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia. President
 Shevardnadze's party won a majority of the seats in Parliament. Only two other
 parties qualified for representation in Parliament, but opposition parties actively
 participated in preelection planning and election monitoring.
 Women are poorly represented in Parliament. Only 16 women (7 percent) were
 elected to Parliament in 1995, and only 1 woman (6 percent) has been named to
 a ministerial post.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The Government generally respects the right of domestic and international orga-
 nizations to monitor human rights, but has limited the access of some organizations
 to prisoners (see Section 1.c.).
 Domestic human rights monitoring is politicized. The Government claims that
 most local human rights groups are extensions of partisan political groups, while
 those groups criticized the State Committee on Human Rights, which has been dis-
 banded, and the Parliamentary Committee on Human Rights, for favoring the Gov-
 ernment. Pending since 1995, when filled, the constitutionally mandated Public
 Human Rights Defender will be selected and funded by Parliament, but accountable
 neither to the Parliament nor the executive. The extended delay in filling this posi-
 
 
 948
 tion reflects continued disagreement between the President and Parliament over a
 mutually acceptable candidate.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution recognizes the equality of all citizens without regard to race, lan-
 guage, sex, religion, skin color, political views, national, ethnic, or social affiliation,
 origin, social status, landownership, or place of residence. The Constitution provides
 for Georgian as the state language, but not all minorities in Georgia prefer to use
 Georgian. As a practical matter, the approximately 500,000 Armenians and 300,000
 Azens prefer to communicate in their own language. The Abkhaz, Ossetian, and
 Russian communities prefer to use Russian. Georgian and Russian are both used
 for interethnic communication.
 Women.-Women's nongovernmental organizations (NGO's) report that family vio-
 lence and rape are not common, although spousal abuse and sexual harassment oc-
 curs. Spousal abuse usually goes unreported, and police are reluctant to investigate
 complaints. Sexual harassment is increasingly reported as a problem in the work-
 place. The Government has no support services for abused women, although police
 reportedly investigate reports of rape.
 Human rights monitors in Abkhazia continue to note reports of rape of non-
 Abkhaz women by young Abkhaz men, often in paramilitary dress, but these as-
 saults reportedly decline in 1996.
 Women's access to the labor market continues to be confined mostly to low-paying
 and low-skill positions frequently despite high professional and academic qualifica-
 tions. Few women work in professional positions and women have suffered dis-
 proportionately when companies and organizations laid off woriers. An NGO Asso-
 ciation for the Employment of Women was established in 1995 by a group of con-
 cerned Georgian women for registering unemployed women, but has not been active.
 Several organizations have been formed to promote women's rights, includirg
 Georgian Women's Choice and the Political Organization for the Defense of Women's
 Rights. The two organizations cooperate closely to promote an agenda concentrated
 on the "social and economic rights of women.
 Children.-Government services for children are extremely limited. The 1995
 Health Reform Act withdrew the right of children over the age of I year to free med-
 ical care. While education is officially free, many parents are unable to afford books
 and school supplies, and most parents have to pay for their children's education.
 The Georgian private voluntary organization (PVO), "Child and Environment,"
 noted a dramatic rise in homeless children following the collapse of the Soviet
 Union. It estimates that there are approximately 1,000 street children in Tbilisi due
 to the inability of orphanages and the Ministry of Education to provide support.
 Child and Environment also repvorted a growing trend towards child involvement in
 criminal activity, narcotics, and prostitution despite the cultural tradition of protect-
 ing children.
 People With Disabilities.-There is no legislative or otherwise mandated provision
 requiring accessibility for the disabled. The Law on Labor has a section that in-
 ciuds the prvision of special discounts and favorable social policies for those with
 disabilities, especially disabled veterans.
 Many of the state facilities for the disabled that operated in the Soviet period
 have been closed because of lack of government funding. Most disabled persons are
 supported by fmily members, or by international humanitarian donations.
 Religious Minorties.-The Georgian Orthodox Church, wary of proselytism, has
 sought to hinder evangelical missionaries and the Salvation Army. In one instance,
 the Orthodox Church urged the polic to question foreign Christian missionaries
 (see Section 2.c.). The Catholic Church also complains of continuing delays in the
 return of churches ciosed during the Soviet period and later given to the Georgian
 Orthodox Church. A prominent Armenian church in Tbilisi remains closed.
 Organizations promoting the rights of Jews and Jewish emigration continue to re-
 port that the Government provids good cooperation and support. Jewish leaders in
 the country attribute isolated acts of anti-Semitism in previous years to general in-
 stability and disorder. The Government has been outspoken in denouncing anti-
 Semitism. A virulently anti-Semitic article that appeared in the independent news-
 paper Noi during the summer prompted a public rebuke from the President. The
 Prosecutor's Office fied charges against the edito for inciting interethic hatred.
 National/RacialEthnic Minorities .-T he Government generally respects the
 rights of individuals of ethnic minorities in noncnflict areas, but limits self-govern-
 ment in the ethnic Armenian and Azeri enclaves. The Government provides funds
 for ethnic schools, and the teaching of non-Georgian languages is permitted. Vio-
 
 
 949
 
 lence in Abkhazia and South Ossetia reflects historic ethnic conflicts and the legacy
 of Soviet policy, designed to pit ethnic minorities against one another.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution provides for the right of citizens
 to form and join unions. The Soviet Labor Code, still in effect, specifies that these
 unions must be registered with the Ministry of Justice.
 A union of trade unions (the Amalgamated Trade Unions of Georgia) has been es-
 tablished and comprises 25 sectoral unions. The union, jointly with the Ministry of
 Justice, has prepared a draft law on trade unions. The union sees the Xrotection
 of social and economic rights of workers as the basic function of trade unions.
 Unions are remnants of the Soviet period when they were essentially administrative
 bodies concerned with property and finance rather than with workers' rights.
 There are no legal prohibitions against affiliation and participation in inter-
 national organizations. The right to form unions is protected under the Constitution.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The Constitution and the So-
 viet Labor Code allow workers to organize and bargain collectively, and this right
 is respected. The Labor Code also prohibits antiunion discrimination by employers
 against union members. Employers may be prosecuted for antiunion discrimination

 the minimum age for employment of children is 16 years; however, in exceptional

 abolished in 1995 and replaced by a wage scale that sets salaries for various grades
 in the public sector, the lowest of which is approximately $10 (13 lari) per month.
 There is no state-mandated minimum wage for private sector workers. A recent
 Government report concluded that $77 per month was required for the basic mini-
 mum needs of an individual Pensions and salaries are usually insufficient to meet
 basic minimum needs.

 ergy crisis. The Labor Code permits higher wages for hazardous work and permits
 a worker in such fields to refuse duties that could endanger life.
