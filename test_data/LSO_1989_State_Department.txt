 LESOTHO
 A six-member Military Council, led by Major General J. M.
 Lekhanya, has ruled Lesotho since seizing power in a coup
 d'etat in 1986. The Military Council is firmly in control of
 the State, but it formally conferred all legislative and
 executive power on Moshoeshoe II, the previously powerless
 King of Lesotho. The Military Council and the King rule by
 decree; however, a predominately civilian appointed Council of
 Ministers administers the day-to-day operations of
 government. During 1989, while local elections were held, the
 military regime continued its ban on genuine political
 activity and gave no indication of its intention to restore
 constitutional rule, which was abolished by former Prime
 Minister Jonathan in 1970.
 The Royal Lesotho Defense Force (RLDF) of about 2,003 troops
 is responsible for internal and border security. The RLDF is
 assisted by a small police force of roughly equal size.
 Public security stabilized in 1989, and the Government ended
 in August its 1988 state of emergency (SOE) against crime.
 A landlocked country completely surrounded by South Africa,
 Lesotho is almost entirely dependent on its neighbor for
 trade, finance, employment, and access to the outside world.
 Approximately 60 percent of the adult male labor force is
 employed in South Africa's mines, and remittances from workers
 (more than $230 million in 1988) are a critical factor in
 financing imports.
 Human rights in Lesotho in 1989 remained circumscribed. Major
 concerns included: the use of preventive detention without
 trial to blunt opposition political activity and restrictions
 on freedom of speech, assembly, and the right of citizens to
 change their government through democratic means. In 1989
 Military Council Chairman Lekhanya was exonerated for shooting
 to death a 20-year-old university student who was allegedly
 fleeing from the campus scene of an attempted rape of a local
 woman (see Section l.e.). In a significant development, the
 Government in February permitted the return of Basutoland
 Congress Party (BCP) leader Ntsu Mokhehle, following nearly 15
 years of political exile, together with hundreds of his
 followers who were peacefully reintegrated into the local
 society.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 The Government made no progress in identifying the
 perpetrators or their motives for the brutal 1986 murders of
 former Ministers of Information and Foreign Affairs, Desmond
 Sixishe and Vincent Makhele, and their wives. However, a
 judicial inquiry to investigate the killings was convened in
 November 1989. Amnesty International has also continued to
 press for inquiries into the suspicious 1988 deaths, while in
 custody, of Samuel Hlapo, a hijacker, and Mazizi Maqokesa, a
 South African exile member of the African National Congress.
 During 1989 a number of apparently politically motivated
 murders took place in several rural areas of southern Lesotho,
 
 
 174
 LESOTHO
 along the border with the South African homeland of Transkei.
 On June 9, a passenger bus traveling from Xixondo to Quthing
 was attacked by five unknown gunmen. Three people were
 killed, four injured, and the bus was set on fire. In early
 August, a military vehicle was attacked along the
 Quthing-Mount Moorosi road by three unidentified gunmen,
 although no one was killed or injured. Later in the year, at
 least seven people, mostly merchants and shopkeepers, were
 killed by unidentified gunmen in the Mohale's Hoek district.
 Authorities believe that a Transkei-based renegade faction of
 the Lesotho Liberation Army (LLA), which broke with the BCP
 and repudiated the leadership of Ntsu Mokhehle, was
 responsible for the killings. This is the same group held
 responsible for a 1988 Maseru bus hijacking in which five
 people--three hijackers anG two hostages--were killed.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reports of politically related disappearances in
 1989. Independent and church-affiliated newspapers reported
 several abductions by South African authorities in Lesotho.
 Victims reportedly included both criminal suspects and
 political targets. The Government neither condones nor
 collaborates with South Africa in these alleged operations.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 SOE powers were exercised arbitrarily in some cases; in 1988
 there were frequent reports of police beatings, ill-treatment,
 and-even death of-some-suspects in custody. The police were
 granted immunity under emergency regulations against
 prosecution for any acts committed in the course of their
 duties. Excesses by law enforcement agencies continued to
 occur in 1989, including false arrests and ill-treatment of
 suspects. These excesses, however, did not occur with the
 same frequency as during the early period of the SOE. Several
 police officers were tried and convicted for human rights
 abuses during the year.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Lesotho declared the SOE in February 1988 as a measure to
 combat rising crime. In April 1988, the High Court annulled
 the SOE on the basis that the emergency had been illegally
 declared. Eleven days later, however, the Government renewed
 the SOE, and the SOE remained in force until August 1989. The
 Government briefly considered renewing the SOE in December.
 The SOE gave the police extensive-powers of arrest, search,
 and seizure without a warrant. -Persons suspected of armed
 robbery and certain other criminal offenses could be detained
 for up to 14 days and for longer periods on order of the
 Minister of Defense and Internal Security. Under the
 emergency regulations, an arrest without a warrant could be
 made on grounds of "reasonable" police suspicion of the
 commission of a specified crime. The regulations provided no
 standards for determining reasonableness, however, and the
 lack of early judicial review left open the possibility of
 essentially arbitrary detention.
 Even during the SOE, established procedures remained in effect
 for normal civil and some criminal cases, including the right
 of a detainee to an early determination of the legality of his
 detention. The 1981 Criminal Procedures and Evidence Act, as
 
 
 175
 amended in 1984, makes provision for the granting of bail.
 Under the Act, the High Court is the only judicial body
 empowered to grant bail in cases of armed robbery or suspected
 homicide.
 In political cases, the Internal Security (general) Act (ISA)
 of 1984 applies. This Act provides for so-called
 investigative detention without charge or trial for up to 42
 days (the first 14 days on'order of the police; the second 14
 days on order of the police commissioner; and the final 14
 days on order of the Minister of Defense and Internal
 Security). Detainees may be held incommunicado up to 14
 days. During the second stage of the detention, ministerially
 appointed "advisers" (all government employees to date) report
 on the'health of the detainee, investigate whether the
 detainee has been involved in subversive activities, and
 advise the Minister of Defense and Internal Security of the
 need for continued detention. Detainees under the Act may
 make representation about their own treatment only through the
 adviser. The Act also allows for detention of witnesses in
 security cases.
 In addition, a 1986 amendment to the ISA allows the Minister
 of Defense and Internal Security to "restrict" a person, who,
 in the opinion of the police commissioner, is conducting
 himself in a manner prejudicial to public order, security,
 administration of justice, or obedience to the law or lawful
 authority. A restriction order limits the movements of a
 restricted person to a certain location and to certain hours
 of the day and may prohibit association or communication with
 other persons.
 The Government twice invoked the ISA against perceived
 political opponents during 1988-1989. One case involved
 Johnny Wa Ka Maseko, a South African-born editor of the
 independent newspaper, The Mirror, who was deported from
 Lesotho in December 1988 after publishing a series of articles
 on alleged government corruption. Maseko, who had lived in
 Lesotho since 1980 as a political refugee, was first arrested
 on October 27, 1988, on charges of criminal defamation. He
 was released on bail the same day but was rearrested on
 November 14, held for 4 weeks under the ISA, and then deported
 for alleged subversion and espionage.
 The second, case involved Joel Moitse, a university lecturer
 and former cabinet minister in the previous government, and
 Majora Molapo, a civil servant in the previous government,
 nephew of the late Prime Minister Jonathan, and active in the
 banned Basutoland National Party. The two were detained in
 May following the publication of a highly critical political
 tract against the King and his Government. Moitse was
 released from detention on June 7, just as his detention was
 being challenged in the High Court. On his release, Moitse
 was immediately issued with a restriction order and confined
 to his family residence. The order was lifted after 6 days,
 but it wag the first known restriction order issued by the
 military Government. Malapo was subsequently released without
 restrictions.
 The military Government's general amnesty for exiled Basotho
 remained in effect. Following secret negotiations in late
 1988, BCP leader Ntsu Mokhehle returned to Lesotho in February
 1989. The core element of the BCP military wing, the LLA, was
 disbanded, except for a small dissident group reportedly based
 in the Transkei. The return of Mr. Mokhehle and most of his
 
 
 176
 LESOTHO
 followers represented a major achievement for the Government's
 policy of national reconciliation. There was no indication in
 1989 whether Mokhehle would be permitted to engage in
 political activity.
 With regard to forced or compulsory labor, see Section 6.c.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The judiciary consists of the Court of Appeal, the High Court,
 magistrate courts, and customary or traditional courts, which
 exist largely in rural areas to administer customary law.
 Court decisions and rulings are respected by the authorities
 and are generally free of interference by the executive.
 Accused persons have the right to counsel and public trials.
 The courts have acted to limit infringements of law on
 numerous occasions in past years, e.g., its April 1988
 annulment of the SOE on procedural grounds (but which the
 Government quickly reinstituted). Under the system of
 Roman-Dutch law applied in Lesotho, there is no trial by
 jury. Criminal trials are normally adjudicated by a single
 High Court judge who presides with two assessors, who serve in
 an advisory capacity. In civil cases, judges normally hear
 cases alone. The High Court also provides procedural and
 substantive advice and guidance on matters of legal procedure
 to military tribunals; however, it does not participate in
 arriving at judgments. Military tribunals have jurisdiction
 only over military cases.
 A judicial inquest is initiated by the Attorney General on the
 authority of the Judicial Inquest Proclamation Number 32 of
 1954. In the Lekhanya case, the Chairman of the Military
 Council shot and killed a 20-year-old university student as
 the student was allegedly fleeing from the scene of an
 attempted rape of a local woman. After a controversial
 2-month judicial inquest into the circumstances of the death,
 during which General Lekhanya testified and submitted to
 cross-examination, the Chairman was exonerated following a
 judicial finding of justifiable homicide.
 There were no known political prisoners in Lesotho at the end
 of 1989.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Both the 1988 SOE regulations and the ISA provide police with
 wide powers to stop and search persons and vehicles and to
 enter homes and other places for similar purposes without a
 warrant. In 1989 there were some reports of violations of
 individual privacy by state authorities, but these were
 greatly reduced from the number reported during the 1988 SOE.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Human Rights Act of 1983 provides for freedom of
 expression but subordinates this freedom to the needs of
 national security. Following the 1986 coup, a formal ban on
 politics was announced with stringent restrictions on freedom
 of speech and political assembly. In particular, Government
 Order No. 4 prohibits persons and groups from making political
 speeches and from publishing or distributing political party
 materials.
 
 
 177
 LESOTHO
 Despite the ban on organized political party activity,
 political activists met privately in 1989, and leaders of
 Lesotho's five principal political parties made individual or
 joint statements criticizing the military Government and
 calling for a restoration of civilian rule. Except for the
 cases of Moitse and Molapo, the Government made no attempt to
 inhibit such political discussion or activity.
 The Government controls the official media (one radio station
 and a weekly newspaper) and ensures that they faithfully
 reflect government views. However, the Government rarely uses
 them to attack its critics, and opposition viewpoints were
 routinely expressed in 1989 in two Sesotho-language weekly
 newspapers published by the Roman Catholic Church and the
 Lesotha Evangelical Church. Also, despite deportation of the
 editor of The Mirror, it continued to be published in 1989,
 and was sometimes critical of the Government.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The military Governments ban on "politics" was not
 interpreted to require the dissolution of existing political
 parties, but the ban does preclude political gatherings and
 rallies. Nonpolitical organizations and professional groups
 are freely formed, even encouraged, and are allowed to hold
 public and regular meetings.
 For a discussion of freedom of association as it applies to
 labor organizations, see Section 6.a.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 There is no state religion in Lesotho. Free and open
 religious practice is permitted and encouraged. Christianity
 is the dominant faith of the majority of Basotho, and Roman
 Catholicism is preeminent. There is a significant Protestant
 minority composed of the Lesotho Evangelical Church, the
 Anglican Church, and a number of other smaller denominations.
 Conversion is permitted, and there is no apparent social or
 political benefit or stigma attached to belonging to any
 particular church. There are no bars to missionary activity
 or work by foreign clergy.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Citizens generally are allowed to move freely within the
 country and across national boundaries. There were instances
 in recent-years, however, in which the Government restricted
 passports for political reasons, but none occurred in 1989.
 Liberal emigration policies exist, and the Government places
 no obstacles in the way of its own citizens who wish to
 emigrate.
 The refugee flow from South Africa slowed dramatically in
 recent years to only a few refugees per month. In 1989 there
 were only 56 refugee cases, 45 of which were South African.
 In these cases, persons have been treated fairly, consistent
 with Lesotho's international obligations. Refugees affiliated
 with South African liberation movements, however, were given
 expeditious transit to third countries for resettlement. More
 than 300 refugees without this affiliation have been allowed
 to resettle in Lesotho.
 
 
 178
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Citizens of Lesotho currently do not have the freedom to
 change the existing government, nor do they play a role in
 national decisionmaking. The military Government, which
 assumed power in 1986, announced that it intends to remain in
 power until peace and national reconciliation are fully
 restored. Neither a time frame for this process has been set,
 nor has any schedule been announced for constitutional
 discussions, elections, and a return to civilian rule.
 Elections for local development councils were contested by
 persons not officially affiliated with political parties.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government has been unresponsive on human rights issues;
 particularly when the call for outside investigation emanates
 from the domestic political opposition. Representations by
 several influential human rights and media organizations in
 the Maseko deportation case had no effect, but similar
 appeals, including from the National University of Lesotho
 staff association, may have been a factor in the decision to
 release professor Joel Moitse.
 There are no internal human rights organizations, either
 official or nongovernmental. Reports of alleged human rights
 abuses are sometimes carried in the local press, particularly
 the church newspapers and Lesotho's sole independent weekly,
 The Mirror.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Most citizens of Lesotho speak a common language and share
 common historical and cultural traditions. Nonindigenous
 citizens have generally married into the Basotho nation, which
 tends to be inclusive and assimilative. Expatriate
 communities are small and are not considered to be a major
 factor in the country's political life. Asians (primarily
 ethnic Chinese and Indians) and South African whites are
 active in the country's commercial life. In 1987 the military
 Government formulated a policy aimed at "localization" of
 Lesotho's commercial retail trade, and, under the trading
 enterprise order, called on foreign owners to enter into joint
 ventures with Basotho nationals. Equity transfers would
 entail compensation. To date, the "localization" order has
 not been strictly enforced, due largely to difficulties in
 identifying local entrepreneurs to take over expatriate-owned
 businesses and in financing such take-overs, and to concern
 over foreign reaction.
 Political exiles from South Africa, who are often viewed as
 magnets for South African political or military intervention
 in the country, are sometimes allowed to remain in Lesotho on
 condition that they neither engage in political activities nor
 speak openly-znd critically about the political situation in
 South Africa.
 The Government has still not seriously addressed the issue of
 women's rights. In Lesotho these rights are severely limited
 by both law and custom, including.in the area of property,
 inheritance, and contracts. Under Lesotho's customary law, a
 
 
 179
 bESOTHO
 married woman is considered a minor during the lifetime of her
 husband, with all of the legal limitations that this status
 implies. She cannot enter into any legally binding contract,
 whether for employment, commerce,'or education, without her
 husband's consent. A married woman has no standing in court
 and cannot sue or be sued without her husband's permission.
 Despite their second-class status, women in Lesotho
 traditionally have been the stabilizing force in-the home and
 in the agricultural sector, given the absence of over 100,000
 Basotho men who work in South Africa. More female than male
 children complete primary and 'secondary schools.
 Domestic violence, including wife beating, occurs, but, as
 statistics are not available, the extent of the problem is not
 known. In Basotho tradition a wife may return to her
 "maiden-home" if physically abused by her husband; in common
 law, wife beating is a criminal offense and defined as assault
 under the 1981 Criminal Procedure and Evidence Act. A 1976
 High Court case successfully reversed a Roman-Dutch legal
 tradition which recognized a husband's right to chastise his
 wife at will. While the Government has made some attempts to
 enhance the economic prospects of women, very little direct
 action has been taken to improve their subordinate status in
 the society.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Lesotho is a party to the International Labor Organization
 (ILO) Convention 87 -on Freedom of Association and Convention
 98 on Collective Bargaining. At least one new union was
 formed in 1989 to organize construction workers for the
 mammoth $2-billion Highlands Water Project.
 Roughly 60 percent of Lesotho's active male labor force
 between the ages of 20 and 44 work in the Republic of South
 Africa, mainly in gold 'and coal mines. At least 70 percent of
 the remainder'are engaged in traditional agriculture. The'
 rest are employed mainly by the Government and in small
 industries in Lesotho. A majority of Basotho mineworkers are
 members of the South African National Union of Mineworkers
 (NUM). Because the NUMis an extraterritorial worker
 organization, it is not permitted to engage in union
 activities in Lesotho.
 There are two trade union federations in Lesotho, the Lesotho
 Congress of Free Trade Unions (LCFTU) and the Lesotho
 Federation of Trade Unions (LFTU). The much larger LCFTU
 encompasses 24 affiliated independent trade unions; the LFTU
 has 4. Like its predecessor, the current Government supports
 the formation of a single, umbrella trade union center, and
 since 1988 has stepped up its efforts to broker a merger
 between Lesotho's two competing federations. The immediate
 catalyst fdr this renewed interest was the embarrassing
 dilemma faced by the Government recently in deciding which
 federations should represent Lesotho at international
 conferences. More fundamentally, the Government believes that
 the size of Lesotho's work force does not warrant the more
 than 30 existing labor unions and would like to see these
 consolidated. A merger would also eliminate competition among
 unions in their negotiations with employers, and enhance the
 bargaining power of the work force. There are, however, deep
 philosophical, political, and ideological differences between
 
 
 180
 LESOTHO
 the two federations, reflecting the historical differences of
 the two political parties with which they are affiliated. As
 the federations were unable to reach agreement in 1989, the
 Government is considering legislation to force the desired
 merger.
 While a legal right to strike exists for workers in
 nonessential services, in practice the procedure for calling a
 strike is so lengthy and cumbersome that it discourages legal
 strike actions and accounts for the prevalence of wildcat
 strikes. The 1964 Trade Union and Trade Disputes Act
 enumerates lengthy procedures which must be followed before a
 strike is called. The last general strike was in 1961. There
 were several wildcat strikes in 1988 and 1989 against both
 foreign and domestic companies, mostly over wages and
 conditions of work. Usually, wildcat strikes have been of
 short duration and ended in compromise, although a 1988 strike
 at the government-owned Lesotho flour mills ended with the
 dismissal of more than 300 employees. In 1989 workers went on
 strike against a South African construction firm building an
 access road to the Highlands Water Project. The workers were
 protesting differential wage and working conditions and the
 employment of large numbers of South African workers; the
 action turned violent and resulted in serious injury to two
 workers.
 The LCFTU is a member of the Southern African Trade Union
 Coordination Council, the Organization of African Trade Union
 Unity, and the International Confederation of Free Trade
 Unions. The LFTU has fewer international affiliations but is
 becoming more active internationally. Aside from a 1987-1988
 prohibition on the travel of LCFTU Secretary General Jonathan,
 the Government has placed no obstacles to international
 affiliations or foreign travel for labor union-related
 purposes.
 In its 1989 report, the ILO Committee of Experts (COE) asked
 the Government to report if the SOE was still in effect, and
 whether any regulations had been adopted under this
 legislation. The Committee also reiterated its objection to
 provisions of the Essential Services Arbitration Act which
 restricts the right to strike and applies compulsory
 arbitration to disputes in the banking industry.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 All trade unions in Lesotho enjoy the right to organize and
 bargain collectively. These rights were established in the
 1964 Trade Union and Trade Disputes Act and in the 1967
 Employment Act, as amended in 1977. There is also an unfair
 labor practices tribunal whose mandate is to investigate
 unfair labor practices and safeguard worker rights. A
 government-appointed labor commission is also charged with,
 inter alia, monitoring wage and working conditions and
 accepting, reviewing, and investigating worker complaints.
 There is clear recognition in Lesotho, however, that its
 industrial relations system is outmoded. The Government has
 been working for several years with the ILO to formulate a
 comprehensive new labor code. In September, following
 extensive local tripartite consultations, the Government gave
 preliminary approval to a draft labor code, which includes 242
 separate provisions aimed at bringing the country's labor laws
 into full conformity with ILO standqrds promoting collective
 
 
 181
 LESOTHO
 bargaining and greatly simplifying the worker's right to
 strike.
 Lesotho has several indtustrial estates grouping together
 companies, mostly textile and apparel firms, engaged in
 manufacturing for export. There are no prohibitions against
 organized labor in these industrial zones, and labor laws are
 applied uniformly throughout the country.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Forced or compulsory labor is prohibited by the 1987
 Employment Act and is not practiced in Lesotho.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 Fourteen is the legal minimum age for employment in commercial
 or industrial enterprises. In practice, however, children
 under 14 may be employed in family-owned businesses. There
 are prohibitions against the employment of working age minors
 in commercial, industrial, or nonfamily enterprises involving
 hazardous or dangerous working conditions. Basotho minors
 under 18. years may not be recruited for employment outside of
 Lesotho. Enforcement of all laws is lax.
 In Lesotho's traditional society, life and working conditions
 for the country's young "herdboys" tend to be much more
 rigorousand demanding than conditions in the modern sector.
 Their quasi-pastoral life, however, is considered a
 prerequisite to eventual manhood and is a fundamental feature
 of Sotho life, tradition, and culture.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 Lesotho's 1967 Employment Act spells out basic worker rights,
 including a 45-hour workweek, a weekly rest period of at least
 24 hours, 11 to 12 days' paid leave per year, and pay for
 public holidays. Employers are required to provide adequate
 light, ventilation, and sanitary facilities for employees, and
 to install and maintain machinery to minimize the risk of
 injury. In practice, these regulations are generally followed
 only within the wage economy, and enforcement mechanisms are
 weak.
 Wages in Lesotho are extremely low. The Government, through
 the mechanism of a tripartite wages advisory board, raised
 minimum wages in 1989 for various..types of work. These ranged
 from $72 a month fox light unskilled labor to about $100 per
 month for semiskilled jobs. The vast majority of wage earners
 supplement their monthly income through subsistence
 agriculture and/or remittances from relatives employed in
 South Africa. Many employers in Lesotho now pay more than
 minimum wages in an effort to attract and retain motivated
 employees. Government salaries were raised in 1988 at a
 percentage increase greater than the 1989 increase for minimum
 wages. A number of government employees were dismissed in
 1989 under the Government's International Monetary Fund
 structural adjustment program.
 In collaboration with the ILO, the Government will begin a
 3-year project in 1990 to upgrade its national occupational
 and health safety standards.- This is a regional project which
 will also include Botswana and Swaziland.
