 HONDURAS
 Honduras continues to make encouraging progress as a
 democracy. Governed since 1982 by the civilian administration
 of President Roberto Suazo Cordova, the country is now
 preparing for the November, 1985 national elections. The
 military remains strong and is clearly an important force, but
 it supports the civilian government. Following the removal
 from office of the Chief of the Armed Forces and others in
 March, the new military leaders promptly pledged their support
 for civilian rule and their commitment to scheduled 1985
 elections.
 There are four legally registered political parties, each
 represented in the National Congress. A massive voter
 registration program is underway in preparation for the
 elections, which would mark the first democratic succession of
 governments in recent history. Labor and campesino
 organizations continue to operate freely and play a major role
 in national events. Freedom of assembly, of religion, and of
 the press are fully respected, as is freedom of movement both
 within Honduras and in and out of the country.
 Instability and turmoil in Central America inevitably affect
 domestic human rights in Honduras. Both the military buildup
 in Nicaragua and instability in El Salvador add to Honduras'
 security concerns. In the summer of 1983 and again in 1984
 there were incursions into Honduras by members of a Sandinista
 trained and supplied group. Captured group members included
 Hondurans who later told of their training in Nicaragua and
 Cuba for activities designed to destabilize the Honduran
 Government. Although terrorist acts have declined since 1982,
 the threat continues. In March bombs were placed targeting the
 Supreme Court, the officer training school in Tegucigalpa, and
 the local police station and the Salvadoran consulate in San
 Pedro Sula. In April the Embassy of El Salvador in Tegucigalpa
 was dynamited. There were discoveries of weapons caches and
 terrorist safehouses throughout the country, although fewer
 than in previous years.   In reaction to the continuing treat,
 the Government maintains security measures that include vehicle
 searches and documentation checks. Considerable effort is also
 directed towards reducing the infiltration of arms through
 Honduras to El Salvador.
 Honduras now hosts about 36,000 U.N.-sponsored refugees from El
 Salvador, Nicaragua and Guatemala and about 35,000
 non-sponsored refugees, the latter mostly Nicaraguan. As there
 is considerable evidence that Salvadoran guerrillas use the
 camps near the border as sanctuaries, these refugees are
 largely restricted to camps. Reception, care and protection of
 refugees by the Honduran Government, however, is excellent.
 Honduras is plagued by economic and social problems to which
 the Government is giving increased attention, especially in the
 areas of education, public health, and land reform. Women are
 not subject to legal discrimination. Social and economic
 conditions, however, often deny them true equality.
 Local human rights leaders have confirmed that improvement has
 been made in human rights, while continuing to pressure the
 Government for further improvement and accountability.
 Allegations of human rights-related abuses are fewer than in
 previous years and the Honduran Government shows enhanced
 sensitivity to these complaints. On September 25, President
 
 
 580
 HONDURAS
 Suazo Cordova sent a letter to the Chief of the Armed Forces in
 which he sought to underscore a national policy with respect to
 the observance of human rights.
 Unresolved disappearances remain the major concern of local
 human rights groups. Significantly, however, there were only
 five new reported disappearance cases in 1984, all early in the
 year. A government investigation of disappearances has been
 underway since June 1984. An interim report was released on
 December 31, and at the same time the investigating commission
 was extended for ninety days. It is not yet clear when and how
 the final results will be published.
 Cases of mistreatment of prisoners are alleged, including
 torture, although the number of allegations has decreased since
 last year. Prisons are overcrowded and conditions poor. Due
 process is constitutionally guaranteed, and progress in
 judicial reform is being made.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 The head of the private Committee for the Defense of Human
 Rights in Honduras has accused the Government of involvement in
 deaths that were allegedly politically motivated. No more than
 five cases were alleged by various interested parties during
 1984. The Government has responded that either these cases
 occured during active pursuit of guerrillas and subversives or
 that private conflicts resulted in some of the deaths.
 b. Disappearance
 According to the Committee for the Defense of Human Rights, a
 total of 112 unexplained disappearances have occurred in
 Honduras during 1981-1984. Five new cases were claimed in
 1984, compared to ten cases in 1983. These five cases date to
 the period January-March 1984, and there have been no
 substantiated incidents since then. The most dramatic of the
 disappearances were those in March of Rolando Vindel, Secretary
 General of the Electrical Workers Union, and Gustavo Morales,
 Sub-Director of the National Lottery. Both were seized
 publicly by armed men and have not been heard of since. The
 Government denies knowledge of their whereabbuts or of events
 leading to their disappearances. It denies as well that they
 are being held by security forces. Government officials
 continue to claim that many of those who 'disappeared" are in
 fact exiles who left Honduras to receive guerrilla training in
 Nicaragua or Cuba. Several others, although their names appear
 on the *disappeared' list, have been found living normal lives.
 In some instances during the year, in cases that involved
 alleged subversion or terrorism, the Government security forces
 denied knowledge of the whereabouts of disappeared persons but
 later arraigned those same individuals or released them after
 questioning. One such case involved the detention in March,
 1983 and release in July, 1984 of accused subversive Ines
 Murillo.
 Human rights groups met in 1984 with high government officials,
 including Foreign Minister Paz Barnica, Armed Forces Chief
 General Walter Lopez and Armed Forces Auditor General Suarez
 
 
 581
 HONDURAS
 Benavides, to discuss disappearances. The meetings were hailed
 as successful and encouraging by local human rights leaders.
 In October, the Chairman of the Congressional Commission on
 Constitutional Guarantees publicly expressed interest in the
 problem and spoke of serious obstacles in the way of
 establishing the fate of those claimed as disappeared. A
 military commission, appointed by the Chief of the Armed Forces
 on June 14, 1984, to investigate the problem of disappearances,
 submitted an interim report to President Suazo Cordova on
 December 29 and publicly released it two days later. This
 report, short on specific information, was sharply criticized
 by a number of Honduran groups concerned with human rights
 issues as being vague, inconsistent and contradictory. It is
 not clear whether a final, more complete account of the
 commission's findings will be published.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Torture is prohibited under the law, and its practice is
 officially denied. Nevertheless, there were cases in 198A that
 involved credible physical evidence that torture does at times
 occur. Amnesty International's 1983 report mentions documented
 cases of use of the capucha, or hood, and released detainees
 sometimes tell of beatings. However, in certain cases which
 are clearly documented, disciplinary action has been taken
 against the responsible officials. In January, the head of the
 National Department of Investigation was removed and two
 policemen sentenced to prison following the beating and death
 of a detained student. In August, the local press reported an
 allegation by an accused member of the "Cinchoneros," the group
 which claimed responsiblity for several bombings, that he had
 been denied medical attention for knee injuries suffered while
 in detention. He has since received the needed surgery. When
 torture is substantiated, the courts have found evidence so
 obtained as inadmissible. In fact, to be admissible as
 evidence, confessions obtained by police have to be repeated to
 an officer of the court.
 Other forms of mistreatment, such as denial of food and rest
 are fairly common. There is no capital punishment in Honduras.
 Prison conditions are poor. Prisons are overcrowded and dirty,
 and prisoners or their relatives must provide some, if not all,
 of their own food. Visits are liberally allowed, however, and
 at times prisoners are permitted to leave to attend to urgent
 family problems. Better conditions may be obtained by those
 able to pay for them.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Although there has been a reduction in the amount of detention
 time before a hearing, extended pre-arraignment detention is
 fairly common. Under Honduran law, a person must be presented
 before a judge within 24 hours of arrest and the judge must
 decide within six days whether there is sufficient evidence to
 hold the accused for trial. In practice this is not always
 followed, often due to administrative problems. Cases of
 persons accused of subversion or terrorism are likely to be
 delayed several days or even weeks. Security forces complain
 that the rules of evidence under the 1906 penal procedure code
 do not allow sufficient time for leads in security cases to be
 explored, resulting at times in delays in presenting a detainee
 to the court owing to the security forces' wish to complete
 investigations after detaining the suspect. The present penal
 
 
 582
 HONDURAS
 code, including the procedural code, has now been revised and
 the new code will be implemented in March, 1985. Although most
 arrests are made openly, in some cases, most often those
 involving alleged terrorist or subversive activity, arrests are
 made secretly and the accused held for several days without
 authorities acknowledging the detention.
 An *appeal for personal exhibition' can be filed with the
 Supreme Court to locate an individual, but the success of this
 motion depends entirely on the cooperation of security forces
 Recently, in a promising development, a judge requested and
 received permission to search a local military prison for
 missing individuals. Release on bail is common, and accused
 persons are free to select their own lawyers. In theory,
 public defenders are available, but in practice this is often
 not the case, due to budgetary constraints.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Although slow and at times cumbersome, the judicial system does
 allow for fair trial. There are no secret tribunals. Delays
 almost always result from administrative inadequacy and not
 from deliberate action. Persons are tried for criminal acts
 and not for political beliefs, although social and economic
 status are factors in obtaining adequate access to legal
 process. There have been cases where it appears persons may
 have been arrested and held for a limited time because of
 political beliefs. They are invariably released if they have
 committed no crime. There are no political prisoners.
 The Constitution provides for judicial independence. Supreme
 Court justices are appointed for four-year terms by the
 National Congress and lower court judges by the Supreme Court.
 Since Congress is controlled by the Liberal Party of President
 Suazo, the executive office also exercises considerable control
 over the judiciary.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Although there have been scattered reports in rural areas of
 security forces entering homes without authorization to search
 for terrorists, these incidents are the result of abuse of
 authority rather than official policy. The Government does not
 interfere with its citizens' personal or family lives.
 Section 2 Respect of Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Freedom of expression is guaranteed by the Constitution, and
 both freedom of speech and press are respected. Honduras has
 four daily newspapers, over 100 radio stations, and a
 two-station national television network, all privately owned.
 The press openly criticizes the Government, military, and
 private sector, often harshly. It does so without fear of
 government reprisal. Academic freedom is respected and student
 groups represent a wide spectrum of political beliefs.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The freedom to organize and demonstrate publicly is enjoyed by
 political parties, student organizations, campesino groups,
 labor unions, and other private organizations, including human
 rights groups. Many have held peaceful public demonstrations
 
 
 583
 HONDURAS
 in the past year. The Government does not generally interfere,
 although police are present to maintain order. The Government
 does not hesitate to act, however, in cases of illegal strikes,
 as in the September, 1984 strike by the electrical workers'
 union.
 in August, six labor activists, all U.S. citizens and
 self-proclaimed representatives of AFL-CIO affiliated unions,
 were deported when they participated in a public rally
 denouncing the Honduran Government and military. The
 Government considered this action a violation of Honduran law
 prohibiting foreigners from political activity while in
 Honduras.
 Trade unions in Honduras are independent, strong, and varied in
 political orientation. Labor legislation is weighted in favor
 of workers and most industries are unionized. Although not
 directly involved in party politics, the unions are influential
 and their positions are given attention by the political
 parties. Antonio Julin Mendez, recently reelected president of
 the largest of the campesino unions is also one of the three
 elected representatives of the Innovation and Unity Party in
 the National Congress. Both professional associations and
 private organizations exist.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Honduras has no state religion. Although the country is
 predominantly Roman Catholic, members of other denominations
 and religions are represented, and their members are free to
 practice religion and engage in all areas of social and
 political activity. Missionaries operate in many areas of the
 country.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Hondurans and most foreign nationals are free to travel within
 or outside of Honduras. Security concerns have periodically
 resulted in vehicle and document checks, but there are no
 permanent travel restrictions within the country.
 The number of refugees in Honduras, both outside and under U.N.
 sponsorship, has swelled to almost 70,000. Some refugees,
 notably those in camps near the Salvadoran border, are not
 allowed to leave the camps, although these controls are not
 effectively enforced. Restrictions are defended as necessaery
 due to the proximity of camps to the Salvadoran border and
 their use by guerrillas. Honduras and El Salvador are
 currently discussing the voluntary repatriation of those
 Salvadoran refugees who wish to return to their country.
 Several Salvadorans were forcefully repatriated, but they had
 violated their refugee status by engaging in violent acts
 against the Government of Honduras. There was also an
 unexplained deportation of several Nicaraguans, who had
 requested refugee status, by Honduran immigration authorities.
 In general, however, the record of the Honduran government in
 its reception and treatment of refugees is excellent.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change their Government
 With the civilian administration of President Roberto Suazo
 Cordova in its final year, vigorous political activity is
 underway in preparation for the November, 1985 elections. The
 National Registry of Persons seeks to place all Honduran
 
 40-387 0 - 85 - 38
 
 
 584
 HONDURAS
 citizens 18 years old and over on the electoral rolls. Voting
 is mandatory under Honduran law. All legally registered
 parties -- there are currently four -- freely choose their
 candidates, and voters freely select their choices through
 secret ballot. The National Congress has delegates from all
 four parties but is currently controlled by the Liberal Party,
 which has an absolute majority of the members.
 In March, following the removal of Chief of the Armed Forces
 General Gustavo Alvarez and other top military leaders, the new
 military leaders promptly declared the continuing loyalty of
 the armed forces to the civilian government and their
 commitment to democracy and to the 1985 elections. The armed
 forces retain a strong political influence but defer publicly
 and privately to the democratically-elected civilian leadership.
 Section 4 Government Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Honduran Government has shown increased interest in
 cooperating with both local and international human rights
 organizations. Government officials, civilian and military,
 have met with representatives of such organizations on a number
 of occasions. The two private human rights groups organized in
 Honduras are the Committee for the Defense of Human Rights in
 Honduras and the Committee of Families of Disappeared Persons.
 Leaders and members of both speak openly and are widely
 reported in the Honduran press. The Committee of Families of
 Disappeared Persons schedules a monthly march or vigil in the
 capital. Human Rights Committee chairman Ramon Custodio in
 October described the current timeframe as a 'period of
 tranquility' in human rights in Honduras.
 In Amnesty International Report 1984, concern was expressed
 over reports of arbitrary arrest, detention, torture,
 disappearances, and extrajudicial executions. The Honduran
 government was also criticized for its denial of any knowledge
 of the circumstances in many of these cases. In fact,
 Government and military leaders have shown sensitivity to such
 reports. The Congressional Committee on Constitutional
 Guarantees has exhibited new interest in disappearances and
 extrajudicial procedures. The Honduran Bar Association has a
 committee on human rights, and its chairman frequently
 contributes articles to local newspapers. Groups of interested
 persons from the United States and Europe have shown interest
 in human rights problems in Honduras. A delegation from the
 West German parliament was successful in securing the release
 from prison of Ines Murillo, a dual West German-Honduran
 citizen who was implicated in a political kidnapping. The
 armed forces have responded to questions concerning their role
 in disappearances with an investigation, not yet completed. In
 1984 the number of complaints about such practices has
 declined. Freedom House rates Honduras 'Free."
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 Honduras continues to be plagued by economic problems. The
 estimated per capita GNP, accurding to 1982 World Bank
 statistics, is $600 and the GDP in constant 1966 terms only
 slightly more than one billion d6llars. In mid-1983 the
 population of 4,249,000 was growing at a rate of 3.4 percent.
 Infant mortality, according to the Honduran Medical
 Association, is 90.per 1,000 live births; the 1984 World Bank
 figure is 75.5. Life expectancy is 60.36 years. Caloric
 
 
 585
 HONDURAS
 consumption relative to nutritional requirements is 93 percent;
 as of 1976, approximately 46 percent of the population had
 access to safe water and 27 percent to electricity. An
 estimated 55 percent of the Honduran population has access to
 some form of health care and 45 percent to indoor plumbing.
 About 14 percent of the urban and 54.9 percent of the rural
 population are below the absolute poverty level.
 Attempts are being made to improve the educational level and
 literacy rate of both children and adults. Primary school
 enrollment (as a percentage of primary school age children)
 shows little difference between males (91 percent) and females
 (90 percent). The total enrollment for secondary school (as a
 percentage of the secondary school age group), however, is only
 30 percent. The literacy rate, given at 43.1 percent by the
 World Bank in 1974, has risen to about 60 percent. There is
 little difference in the figures for literacy between males and
 females, and a national literacy campaign is underway.
 The Government continues to show interest in land reform; a
 land titling program sponsored by AID is now providing 1,000
 titles per month. Although the process has at times been slow,
 Honduras has a 25-year history of land reform, accepted for the
 most part by larger landowners. Much of the agricultural
 outputs is from small farmers. There are, for example, 45,000
 independent coffee growers. Population growth, in the past few
 years, has increased pressure by campesinos to occupy unused
 land, at times resulting in violence. Through the National
 Agraian Institute, the Government has a program to grant legal
 title to such land to peasants.
 Women are formally protected from discrimination under Honduran
 law. In practice, however, much depends on economic and social
 position. Education is equally available to men and women and
 statistics reveal almost equal school attendance by males and
 females at all levels. Although women occupy judgeships and
 there are several respected women doctors, lawyers, and other
 professionals, there are relatively few women in high
 government positions and fewer still in responsible positions
 in the private sector. A woman serves as Attorney General in
 the Government and Justice Ministry, in October 1984
 Congresswoman Dilma Quezada was named as one of six members on
 the Board of Directors for the Inter-American Committee on
 Women, and women occupy positions of influence in all four
 political parties. The national police has a women's branch,
 although use of women officers is limited to certain services.
 In practice there remains some discrimination against women,
 especially in domestic cases. Ethnic minorities, concentrated
 on the north coast, enjoy social and legal equalty.
