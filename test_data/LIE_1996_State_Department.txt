 LIECHTENSTEIN
 The Principality of Liechtenstein is a constitutional monarchy and parliamentary
 democracy. The reigning Prince is the Head of State; all legislation enacted by the
 popularly elected Parliament (Landtag) must have his concurrence. The Landtag
 elects and the Prince appoints the members of the Government and of the function-
 ally independent* diciary.
 The Interior Ministry effectively oversees the regular and auxiliary police forces.
 There is no standing military force.
 Despite its small size and limited natural resources, Liechtenstein has developed
 during recent decades from an agrarian society into a prosperous, highly industri-
 alized, free-enterprise economy with a vital service sector. It participates in a cus-
 toms union with Switzerland and uses the Swiss franc as its national currency. As
 a result of complex negotiations held with member states of the European economic
 area and Switzerland and a national referendum held in 1995, Liechtenstein is also
 a member of the European Economic Area. Citizens enjoy a very high standard of
 living. Unemployment was only 1.1 percent in 1996.
 The Government fully respects the human rights of its citizens provided for in the
 Constitution, and the law and judiciary provide effective means of dealing with in-
 stances of individual abuse. Existing societal discrimination against women is being
 eliminated in accordance with government policy.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extra judicial Killing.-There were no reports of political or
 other extrajudicial killings.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punshment.-
 The law prohibits torture and cruel punishment, and there were no reports of the
 use of such methods.
 Prison conditions meet minimum international standards, and the Government
 permits visits by human rights monitors.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The law provides for freedom from arbi-
 trary arrest and detention, and the authorities honor these provisions. Within 24
 hours of arrest, the police must bring suspects before an examining magistrate, who
 
 
 1016
 
 must either press formal charges or order release. The law grants suspects the right
 to legal counsel of their own choosing, at no cost if they are indigent. Release on
 personal recognizance or bail is granted unless the examining magistrate has reason
 to believe the suspects are a danger to society or will not appear for trial.
 There is no prvision for exile, and it does not occur.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The judiciary is independent of the executive and
 legislative branches. It has three tiers: lower court, highcourt, and Supreme Court.
 In addition, an Administrative Court hears appeals against government decisions.
 Also, the State Court protects the rights accorded by the Constitution, decides on
 conflicts of jurisdiction between the law courts and the administrative authorities,
 and acts as a disciplinary court for members of the Government.
 The Constitution provides for public trials and judicial appeal, and the authorities
 respect these provisions.
 The Constitution authorizes the Prince to alter criminal sentences or pardon of-
 fenders. However, if the offender is a member of the Government and is sentenced
 for a crime in connection with official duties, the Prince can take such action only
 if the Landtag requests it.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution provides for personal liberty and for inviolability of the home, of postal
 correspondence, and of telephone conversations. No violations were reported. Police
 need a judicial warrant to search private property.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-An independent press, an effective judiciary,
 and a democratic political system combine to ensure freedom of speech and the
 press. Two daily newspapers are published, each representing the interests of one
 of the two major political parties, as is one weekly news magazine. There is a state-
 owned television station and a private radio station, but residents freely receive
 radio and television broadcasts from abroad. An information bulletin is also issued
 by the third party ('Freie Liste") represented in Parliament.
 The Government respects academic freedom.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 freedom of assembly and association, and the authorities do not interfere with these
 rights in practice.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the
 Government does not hamper the teaching or practice of an  faith. The finances of
 the Roman Catholic Church are integrated directly into the budgets of the national
 and local governments. Roman Catholic or Protestant religious education is compul-
 sory in all schools, but the authorities routinely grant exemptions for children whose
 parents so request.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-Citizens have unrestricted freedom to travel in or outside the country,
 to emigrate, and to return.
 The Government cooperates with the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees and
 other humanitarian organizations in assisting refugees. The Government provides
 first asylum, but the country's lack of an airport or international train station
 means it receives few requests. Those entering to cross the Austrian border without
 permission are sent to Austrian authorities in accordance with a bilateral agree-
 ment. Those entering from a third country through Switzerland are dealt with on
 a case-by-case basis. A solution is sought which would avoid forcing people to return
 to a country where they would be subject to persecution on political, religious, or
 racial grounds.
 There were 10 new asylum cases in 1996. The 18 Tibetans who entered in 1993
 have not been granted asylum, but the Government has decided for the time being
 not to force them to return. Of the 295 refugees from the former Yugoslavia who
 were given permission to stay until April, 234 are still in country. Of this total 39
 will be allowed to stay until March 3, 1997, 148 will be allowed to stay until July
 31, 1997, and 47 cases were still pending at year's end. Of the additional 40 refu-
 gees from the former Yugoslavia admitted in 1995, only 12 remain.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The monarchy is hereditary in the male line. The 25-member unicameral legisla-
 ture is elected every 4 years. Suffrage is universal for adults over age 20, and ballot-
 ing is secret. A two-party coalition has formed the Government since 1938. Other
 parties operate freely; one nongovernmental party is currently in Parliament: the
 
 
 1017
 Freie Luste. The Government regularly puts initiatives and referendums to popular
 vote.
 Since women gained the right to vote in 1984, a growing number are active in
 politics. Two women are Members of Parliament, and two-one the Foreign Min-
 ister-are among the five members of the Cabinet. Women serve on the executive
 committees in the major parties.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The sole local human rights organization, Justitia Et Pax, is an informal group
 of about 10 persons who monitor prison conditions and assist foreign workers with
 immigration matters.
 No requests were received from any source for investigation of human rights vio-
 lations.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The law prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, language, or social status,
 and the authorities respect these provisions.
 Womrn.-The law prohibits all forms of domestic violence, and the Government
 vigorously prosecutes those who violate the law. The local shelter provided refuge
 for 27 abused women in 1996 only 3 of whom were Liechtenstein citizens.
 Societal discrimination stiil limits opportunities for women in fields traditionally
 dominated by men. In accordance with a 1992 constitutional amendment mandating
 equality for women, Parliament has amended a sigificant number of statutes to en-
 sure equality of treatment, including the citizenship law, the employment law, the
 law onlabor conditions, and the tax law.
 Children.-The Government supports programs to protect the rights of children
 and matches contributions made to the four nongovernmental organizations mon-
 itoring children's rights. There is no societal pattern of abuse against children. The
 U.N. Convention on the Rights of the Child came into force in January. On October
 30, the Parliament ratified the European Convention on Recognition and Enforce-
 ment of Decisions Concerning Custody of Children and on Restoration of Custody
 of Children. At the same time, it also ratified the European Convention on the Legal
 Status of Children Born out of Wedlock.
 People With Disabilities.-Although the law does not expressly prohibit discrimi-
 nation against people with disabilities, complaints of such discrimination may be
 pursued m the courts.
 The Government has required that buildings and government services be made
 accessible for people with disabilities.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Riht of Association.-All workers including foreigners, are free to associ-
 ate, join unions of their choice, and select thir own union representatives. The sole
 trade union represents 13 percent of the work force, but it looks after the interests
 of nonmembers as well. It is a member of the World Confederation of Labor but is
 represented on an ad hoc basis by a Swiss union.
 Workers have the right to strike except in certain essential services. No strikes
 are known to.have taken place in the last 26 years. The law does not provide spe-
 cific protection for strikers. Employers may dismiss employees for refusal to work;
 such dismissals may be contested.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The law provides for the right
 of workers to organize and bargain collectively. However, collective bargaining
 agreements are generally adapted from ones negotiated by Swiss employers and
 umons.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The law prohibits forced or com-
 pulsory labor, and there were no reports of violations.
 d. Minimum Age for Empoment of Children.-The law generally prohibits em-
 ployment of children under 16 years of age; however, exceptions may be made
 under certain circumstances, for some employment of youths older than age 13 and
 for those leaving school after age 14.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-There is no national minimum wage, but even
 the lowest actual wages afford a decent living for workers and their families. The
 law sets the maximum workweek at 45 hours for white-collar workers and employ-
 ees of industrial firms and sales personnel, and 50 hours for all other workers. The
 actual workweek is usually 40 to 43 hours. With few exceptions, Sunday work is
 not allowed. Workers over age 20 receive at least 4 weeks of vacation; younger ones,
 at least 5 weeks.

 The law sets occupational health and safety standards, and the Department for
 Worker Safety of the Office of the National Economy effectively enforces these provi-
 aions.
