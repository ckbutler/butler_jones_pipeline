 MAURIS
 Mauritius is a parliamentary democracy governed by a Prime Minister, a Council
 of Ministers, and a National Assembly. The Head of State is the President, who is
 nominated by the Prime Minister and confirmed by the Assembly, and whose pow-
 ers are largely ceremonial. Fair and orderly national and local elections, supervised
 by an independent commission, take place at regular intervals. There are numerous
 political parties, both large and small, and partisan politics are open and unre-
 strained.
 Under civilian control, a paramilitary special mobile force and a special support-
 ing unit are responsible for internal security. These forces, under the command of
 the Commissioner of Police, are backed by a general duty police force. They are
 largely apolitical and enerally well trained, but police abuse of suspects in custody
 continued to be a problem.
 The economy is based on labor-intensive, export-oriented manufacturing (mainly
 textiles), sugar, and tourism. About 85 percent of cultivable land is planted with
 sugar cane. The country weathered well the global economic slowdown of the early
 1990's and is now attempting to diversify its economy by promoting investment in
 new sectors, such as offshore companies and electronics, and developing Mauritius
 as a regional financial center.
 Although political and civil rights are protected under the Constitution and gen-
 erally respected in practice, some human rights abuses occurred in 1994. One drug-
 trafficking suspect died under unexplained circumstances of injuries suffered while
 in police custody. In fighting drug trafficking, the National Assembly passed a con-
 stitutional amendment that would give the Government authority to detain without
 
 
 charge or trial those persons suspected of illegal drug operations. The Government
 controls the electronic media tightly, and it used the Official Secrets Act in October
 to detain briefly three journalists for publishing an internal memorandum which
 had long been in the public domain. Worker rights continued to be acontroversial
 area, and the right to strike remains extremely limited. Several highly publicized
 court cases illustrated the problem of societal discrimination and violence against
 women.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political
 killings, but a suspect in police custody on drug charges burned to death in his cell.
 The police initially called the death a suicide, but the circumstances surrounding
 the death led human rights groups to call for an independent investigation. As a
 result, the Commissioner of Police imposed disciplinary transfers on the two officers
 in charge of the station where the death occurred, and the Prime Minister called
 for a judicial inquiry into the death. This inquiry was scheduled to begin in early
 1995.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 While torture and inhuman punishment are prohibited by law, there were regular
 well-founded reports of police brutality, involving mistreatment of individuals on the
 street as well as of suspects in custody. The newly appointed Commissioner of Police
 displayed a willingness to pursue such reports of abuse.
 Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Under the Constitution, detained persons
 have the right to a judicial determination of the legality of their detention. Although
 the time limit for making this determination is not specified in law, in practice it
 is usually made within 24 hours. Bail is commonly granted.
 In July the National Assembly passed legislation to amend the Constitution to
 allow the Government to detain suspected drug traffickers indefinitely without trial
 or the possibility of bail. At year's end, the President had not signed the legislation,
 and it had not come into force.
 Exile is legally prohibited and not practiced.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The judicial system consists of the Supreme
 Court, which has appellate powers, and a series of lower courts. Final appeal may
 be made to the Judicial Committee in the United Kingdom (the Privy Council), and
 this is routine in the case of death sentences. There are no military or political
 courts.
 The legal system has consistently provided fair, public trials for those charged
 with crimes. Defendants have the right to private or court-appointed counsel. The
 Supreme Court is also charged under the Constitution with ensuring that new laws
 are consistent with democratic practice. The new legislation allowing for the indefi-
 nite detention of drug traffickers (see Section 1.d.) would amend the Constitution
 and therefore not be subject to Supreme Court review. There were a number of drug
 trafficking trials held in 1994, and' they were generally fair.
 There were no instances in 1994 of executive interference with the judiciary.
 While legal experts express few worries about overt manipulation of the judiciary
 by the executive, they are concerned about political influence over the Commissioner
 of Police, the Director of Public Prosecutions, and a newly established anticorruption
 tribunal. Nevertheless, the Government was responsive to publicity and public con-
 cern about particular instances of corruption and cronyism.
 There were no political prisoners in 1994.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 sanctity of the home is provided for in law and generally respected in practice. The
 search of personal property or premises is allowed only under clearly specified condi-
 tions by court order or by police action in stopping a crime in progress. There were
 reliable reports that the Government's intelligence apparatus continued to carry out
 illegal surveillance of local opposition leaders and other major figures.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-Freedom of speech and press is protected by the
 Constitution and local tradition and is largely respected in practice. Debate in the
 National Assembly is lively and open. While there are occasional complaints of gov-
 ernment influence in editorial policies, over a dozen privately owned daily, weekly,
 and monthly newspapers present varying political viewpoints and freely express
 partisan views, most recently in articles hitting at corruption in government.

 The Government has the ability to counter press criticism by using strict libel
 laws; however, the Government did not use these laws to inhibit the press in 1994.
 The Director of Public Prosecutions dropped its appeal in the 1991 case of two jour-
 nalists charged with giving out false information concerning a sea captain accused
 of fishing in Mauritian waters. Libel suits between private parties are quite com-
 mon.
 The Government used the Official Secrets Act in October to arrest two editors and
 the managing director of the weekly magazine Le Mag, ostensibly for publishing an
 internal document. The document, which was embarrassing to a public official, had
 been in the public domain for over a year. Amidst an outcry from the opposition
 and the press, the Prime Minister subsequently said the Commissioner of Police had
 acted legally but overzealously. After less than 24 hours, the police released the
 three on bail, but with charges and possible court action still pending at year's end.
 The Government controls the most important media, television and radio. These
 remain an official political and cultural tool, with programming and editorial poli-
 cies generally reflecting government interests. The Government gives opposition
 politicians negligible broadcast time. Although there has been much discussion
 about liberalization of the airwaves, private organizations (commercial or political)
 are not authorized to own or operate broadcast stations. In December the Govern-
 ment decided to authorize the importation of "television reception only" (TVRO) sat-
 ellite dishes. Regulations implementing the decision, including provision for a reg-
 istration fee, had not been issued at year's end.
 The Government generally respects academic freedom but from time to time cen-
 sors books. In 1994 the Government banned the sale of the book "The Rape of Sita,"
 charging that the title of the book (which refers to the Hindu goddess) would offend
 the country's Hindu population.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-Political, cultural, and reli-
 gious assemblies are commonplace. Under the 1991 Public Gathering Act, police per-
 mission is required for holding demonstrations and mass meetings. The grounds for
 denial are very specific, and such permission is rarely refused. Groups have the
 right to challenge police denials but complain that the time involved in the appeals
 process often renders the final outcome moot. The police did not interfere with an
 unauthorized gathering in front of Parliament of journalists and others who were
 protesting the arrest of three media colleagues (see Section 1.d.).
 Mauritians enjoy the right to form associations, including political parties, trade
 unions, and religious organizations, although in practice such organizations need
 government approval in order to operate officially. There are six political parties
 represented in the National Assembly and a comparable number of smaller parties
 without Assembly seats. There are a multitude of other private organizations in the
 country.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-Ther is no state religion, and the Government does not
 restrict or interfere with worship by any religious denomination.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-There are no restrictions on freedom of movement within the country,
 foreign travel, or emigration. However, there is no blanket guarantee of repatriation
 of former citizens of Mauritius. Applications from Mauritians abroad who lost their
 citizenship after acquiring a second nationality are handled on a case-by-case and
 sometimes arbitrary basis. There are no refugees in Mauritius.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens have the right and ability to change their government through demo-
 cratic means. Parliamentary, municipal, and village council elections are held at
 regular intervals. All citizens 18 years of age and over have the right to vote and
 run for office.
 In the National Assembly up to eight members are appointed through a "best
 loser* system, designed in part to ensure that all ethnic groups are represented. Po-
 litical parties often match the ethnicity of their candidates to the ethnic composition
 of particular electoral districts.
 While there are no legal impediments to women assuming leadership roles, there
 are practical barriers. Only 2 of the National Assembly's 66 members are women,
 and there are few women in leadership positions. Neither the Government nor the
 political parties have seriously tried to address this imbalance. There has been little
 public pressure for change in this area, and few women are eager to enter the politi-
 cal fray, preferring to pursue other careers.

 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Local human rights groups monitor developments without governmental restric-
 tion or interference. There have been no known requests by international organiza-
 tions to investigate human rights violations in Mauritius.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disabili4y, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution specifically prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, caste,
 place of origin, political opinion, color, or creed. It is silent on questions of sex, dis-
 ability, or language (although the latter is essentially covered under the provisions
 concerning race and place of origin).
 Women.-Women have traditionally occupied a subordinate role in society, and
 legal and societal discrimination continue. Mauritian women cannot transmit citi-
 zenship to their foreign-born children (as can Mauritian men), and foreign husbands
 of Mauritian women cannot automatically obtain residence and work permits (as
 can foreign wives of Mauritian men).
 Violence against women is widespread, particularly wife beating, according to the
 Ministry of Women's Rights and Family Welfare, attorneys, andnongovernmental
 organizations. There are no special provisions in Mauritian law concerning family
 violence. The police are gnerally reluctant to become involved in cases of spousal
 abuse. The issue received some attention during 1994 through several highly pub-
 licizd court cases of alleged spousal murder.
 The Government has tried to promote equality by eliminating legal differentia-
 tions based on gender, e.g., in laws dealing with emigration, inh~eritance, and jury
 service. The Government has appointed desk officers in most ministries who are
 responsible for ensuring that gender issues are taken into account in policy deci-
 sions, but it has undercut their effectiveness by failing to give them enforcement
 powers.
 Children.-Reported incidents of child abuse are infrequent and isolated, though-
 private voluntary organizations claim that the problem is mere widespread than
 publicly acknowledged. At p resent, most government programs are administered by
 the state-funded National Children's Council, which provides counseling and inves-
 tigates reports of child abuse. At the end of the year the Government passed legisla-
 tion which should provide it with improved means of protecting child welfare.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-Disrimination on the basis of race, eth-
 nicity, or caste is prohibited by law, actively discouraged by the Government, and
 not generally practiced.
 People With Disabiites.-Mauritian law requires organizations which employ
 more than 10 people to set aside at least 3 percent of their positions for pople with
 disabilities. The law does not, however, require that work sites be accessibl e to the
 disabled, making it effectively impossible for people with disabilities to fill many
 jobs. There is no law mandating access to public buildings or facilities.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Assciation.-qThe Constitution explicitly protects the right of
 workers to associate in trade unions. Mauritius has an active trade union move-
 ment. Almost 300 unions represent over 100,000 workers, more than 25 percent of
 the total work force. With the exception of essential workers, including police and
 military, workers are free to form and join unions and to organize in all sectors, in-
 cluding in the export processing zone (EPZ). Labor unions are independent from the
 Government. Unions can and do press wage demands, establish ties to domestic po-
 litical parties, and address political issues. Unions are free to establish federations
 or con federations.
 Under the industrial relations act (IRA), unions have the legal right to strike. In
 Practice, however, the IRA requnires a prestrike 21-day cooling-off period, followed
 binding arbitration, which has the effect of making most strikes illegal. Mor-
 over, the IRA states that worker participation in a strike not approved by a court
 is sufficient grounds for dismissal. According to Ministry of Labor statistics, there
 were four strikes in 1994.
 Under the law, unions may and d establish ties with international labor bodies.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Cotectively.The right of employees to bar-
 gain collectively with their employers is protected by law. However, the collective
 bargaining proces is weakened by excessive government intervention in the form
 of wage-setting in the state sector which is generally used as the basis for private-
 sector pay. Wagoes are fet bthe National Remuneration Board (NRB), whose chair-
 man is appointed by the Minister of Labor. About 12 percent of the labor force
 
 
 (480,000) works for national or local government. The IRA prohibits antiunion dis-
 crimination. There is an arbitration tribunal which handles any such complaints.
 Mauritius has an export processing zone (EPZ) which currently employs about
 90,000 people. While there are some EPZ-speciflc labor laws, such as provisions al-
 lowing EPZ employers to require up to 10 hours per week of paid overtime from
 their employees, workers in this sector enjoy the same basic protections as non-EPZ
 workers. Statutory minimum wage levels in the EPZ are somewhat lower than else-
 where, but due to the country's labor shortage actual wage levels are nearly double
 the minimum wage.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced or compulsory labor is pro-
 hibited by law and not practiced.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The legal minimum age for em-
 ployment of children is 15. The Ministry of Labor is responsible for enforcement. Re-
 ports of underage children working illegally are uncommon. While there have been
 cases of children under 15 working in the EPZ, the large, established EPZ factories
 do not hire children under 15.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The Government administratively establishes
 minimum wages, which vary according to the sector of employment, and it man-
 dates minimum wage increases each year based on inflation. The minimum wage
 for an unskilled worker in the EPZ is $11 (188 Mauritian rupees) per week, while
 the lowest weekly wage for a non-EPZ worker is about $12 (200 rupees). While this
 is significantly below the level needed to provide an acceptable standard of living,
 the actual market wage for most workers is much higher due to the present labor
 shortage.
 The standard legal workweek in the industrial sector is 45 hours. In the EPZ an
 employee may be required to work an additional 10 hours per week, although at
 a higher hourly wage.
 The Government sets health and safety standards, and Ministry of Labor officials
 inspect working conditions. The small number of inspectors limits the Government's
 enforcement ability. Workers have the right to remove themselves from dangerous
 work situations without jeopardy to continued employment.
