 KIRIBATI
 Kiribati's 33 islands, scattered across an enormous, area of
 the central Pacific, total only about 750 square kilometers
 and are populated by only 63,000 people (July 1986). Most of
 the people are a Micronesian and Polynesian mixture. Kiribati
 gained full independence from the United Kingdom in 1979 and
 became a'republic within the Commonwealth of Nations. It has
 a nationally elected president and a 35-member legislative
 assembly which is elected by universal suffrage. The economy
 is very small; a majority of the people being engaged in
 subsistence activities. Isolation and meager resources,
 including poor soil and limited arable land, severely limit
 prospects for economic development. Fishing is viewed as one
 of Kiribati's few economic hopes. There were no important
 human rights issues in 1986.

 Freedom from:

 The Constitution contains safeguards against arbitrary arrest
 and detention. Forced labor is prohibited. There is no
 exile, internal or external.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial

 which he is charged and be provided adequate time and
 facilities to prepare his defense. The right to confront
 witnesses, present evidence, and appeal convictions is
 enshrined in law. The judiciary is independent of government
 interference. There are no "special" courts. Kiribati has no
 political prisoners.

 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Freedom of speech and press are guaranteed by the Constitution
 and observed in practice. Kiribati's radio station and sole
 newspaper are government owned. There are also newsletters
 and other periodicals published by churches in Kiribati.
 Academic freedom is respected.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Kiribati's Constitution guarantees freedom of assembly and
 association, including the right of a person to form or belong
 to associations for the advancement or protection of his
 interests. There are no significant restrictions. Kiribati
 has a relatively strong and effective trade union movement.
 In 1982 the 7 trade unions registered in Kiribati merged to
 form the Kiribati Trade Union Congress (KTUC). It has
 approximately 2,500 members, most of them drawn from the
 public service. The KTUC is affiliated with the International
 Confederation of Free Trade Unions and is involved in an
 ongoing trade union education program under the auspices of
 the International Labor Organization (ILO).
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Complete freedom of religion prevails in Kiribati. There is
 no state or preferred religion. Missionaries are free to seek
 converts and actively do so.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Kiribati citizens are free to travel within the country and
 abroad. There are no restrictions on repatriation. Kiribati
 has no displaced persons.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of
 Citizens to Change Their Government
 The Government of Kiribati is chosen by the people in free and
 open elections. Although in 1985 a loosely knit political
 party coalesced around opposition to the Government on a
 single issue, Kiribati has no formalized party system. The
 'government" faction in Parliament generally has consisted of
 those representatives chosen by the President for cabinet
 posts. Members of both the "government" and "opposition"
 factions may oppose the President, depending upon the issue
 under consideration.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 There have been no reported allegations of human rights
 violations by the Government of Kiribati nor any known
 requests for investigations. There are no local
 nongovernmental organizations which concern themselves with
 human rights. The Government has not taken an active interest
 in international affairs, including international human rights
 matters. Kiribati is not a member of the United Nations.

 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 The Constitution prohibits discrimination on the basis of
 race, creed, or national origin. There were no reports of
 discrimination in the provision of social services by the
 Government. Education is free and compulsory through the
 first six grades.
 CONDITIONS OF LABOR
 Kiribati law prohibits the employment of children under age 14.
 Children age 15 are prohibited from industrial employment and
 employment aboard ships. Males under age 16 may not be
 employed in mines. Males under age 18 are prohibited from
 employment at night; and may not work in or aboard ships
 unless suitably trained and certified medically fit. Females
 may not work at night except under specified circumstances
 (generally in service jobs such as hotel clerks). Women are
 provided up to 12 weeks of maternity leave and are entitled to
 not less than 25 percent of their regular salaries during such
 leave. Nursing women are allowed one-half hour twice a day
 during working hours to nurse a child.
 Employment laws also provide basic health and safety standards
 for the workplace. Employers must, for example, provide an
 adequate supply of clean water for their workers and must
 ensure the existence of sanitary toilet facilities. Employers
 are liable for expenses of workers injured on the job.
 Although legislation authorizing the Government to set minimum
 wages exists, it has not been implemented yet. An expert,
 funded by the ILO, is presently preparing a study for the
 Government on procedures for establishing minimum wages.
