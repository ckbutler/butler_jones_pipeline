 AZERBAIJAN
 Azerbaijan declared its independence from the Soviet Union on August 30, 1991,
 at which time the Communist Party First Secretary, Ayaz Mutalibov, became Presi-
 dent of the Republic. After military defeats in Nagorno-Karabakh, including the
 massacre of Azeri civilians in the town of Khojaly, popular protest, organized by the
 opposition Azeri Popular Front (APF), forced Mutal v to resign in March 1992.
 The old Cmmiinit elite. however, held on to control of the Government. On March
 
 
 705
 23, Acting President Yagub Mamedov scheduled presidential elections for June 7.
 It soon became apparent that Abulfez Elchibey, the leader of the APF, would win
 free and fair elections. To avoid such an outcome the old guard returned Mutalibov
 to power on May 14 in a parliamentary coup. Wfien Mutalibov suspended the elec-
 tions and moved to ban all political activity, the APF organized resistance and took
 power in a nearly bloodless countercoup. The APF dissolved the predominantly
 Communist Supreme Soviet (legislature) and transferred its functions to the 50-
 member upper house, the National Council (Milli Majlis). The APF Government
 went ahead with the scheduled presidential elections, and on June 7 Elchibey was
 elected in what international observers considered free and fair elections.
 The APF Government moved to turn the national security and police apparatus
 into those of a democratic state. The national security apparatus, formerly loyal to
 Moscow, became less active than previously, and the militia (aside from Interior
 Ministry troops) was disbanded in favor of a police force.
 Azerbaijan maintained the structure of a command economy, but the "shadow"
 economy-still technically illegal-began taking over in many sectors. Disintegra-
 tion of the Soviet economy led to economic dechne. Unemployment rose to about 28
 percent, and living standards fell. Badly needed economic reform and privatization
 remained to be implemented. Oil was the key foreign exchange earner, but Azer-
 baijan also produced significant quantities of fruit and cotton.
 The most important human rights issue in 1992 was the abuse committed by both
 sides in the conflict between Azerbaijani and Armenian forces in and around
 Nagorno-Karabakh. Both sides took hostages, tortured prisoners, created refugees
 and displaced persons, targeted civilian locations, killed civilians, and carried out
 summary executions. The most significant single attack on civilians was the mas-
 sacre by Armenians of at least 600 Azerbaijani civilians after the fall of Khojaly on
 February 25-26. The introduction of more powerful weapons, including missiles and
 tactical aircraft, escalated the conflict and increased its destructiveness.
 As a result of the conflict, some 18,000 Armenians still in Baku, mostly members
 of mixed marriages, lived in fear of official harassment and unofficial persecution,
 including dispossession of homes, beatings, and kidnapings.
 In aspects unrelated to the conflict, the Government, after the presidential elec-
 tion, attempted to respect human rights: generally, it respected freedom of speech,
 press, and religion and demonstrated a commitment to democratic parliamentary
 processes. Parliamentary elections will be a further important milestone in the ef-
 fort to achieve a multiparty democratic system.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-No political or other extrajudicial
 killings are known to have occurred. See Section 1.g. for reports of killings associ-
 ated with the conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh.
 b. Disappearance.-In the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, both sides frequently took
 hostes, intending to exchange them for prisoners held by the other side. While
 most hostages were taken during raids on villages and other military activities in
 Nagorno-Karabakh, several ethnic Armenians were abducted from Baku and taken
 to the front to be exchanged, allegedly with the involvement of the APF militia.
 Some of these persons cannot be accounted for and have disappeared. The local
 housing authority in Baku allegedly provided information on the whereabouts of Ar-
 menians to those seeking to kidnap them. The Interior Ministry of the new APF-
 led Government has forbidden local housing authorities to give out information on
 residents which might be of use to those wishing to kidnap or harass Armenians.
 On January 8, agents of the Interior Ministry allegedly arrested Konstantin
 Vaganovich Manvelov and his' son, Vyacheslav Konstantinovich Manvelov, and took
 them to the front to be exchanged. The Foreign Ministry was unable to uncover fur-
 ther information about the two. On March 23, an unknown group abducted Lev
 Vaganovich Ovakov-Leonov, an 84-year-old man, from his Baku apartment. Efforts
 to obtain further information on Ovakov-Leonov from the Defense Ministry, Interior
 Ministry, and directly at the front failed to produce results.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degradinm Treatment or Punishment.-
 Vladimir Mamedov, an Armenian, alleged that the militia arrested him on January
 28 and tortured him during an 8-day. period, accusing him of theft. He said he was
 beaten on the head, back, and genitals; his fingers were slammed in a door; and
 his head held under water in a toilet. He was released from prison on April 24.
 Numerous Armenians or part-Armenians alleged being beaten at the hands of un-
 known groups, sometimes acting in the name of the APF. The Government believed
 the perpetrators of these crimes may have come from the over 350,000 refugees and
 
 
 706
 displaced persons in Azerba"an, many of whom have been driven out of Armenia,
 Nagorno-Karabakh, and neighborn  regions over the past 4 years.
 dL Arbtrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Hostage-taking on both sides of the con-
 flict in Nagomno-Karabakh led to numerous instances of arbitrary arrest and deten-
 tion. Baku Armenians reported incidents of arbitrary detention.
 Yuri   Khristforovich  Staroverov  (Karapetov)  and   Mikhail   Yuriyevich
 Shlyapshnikov (Karapetov), alleged that they were detained for 3 days by a uni-
 formed group intending to exchange them for an Azeri-held prisoner in Nagorno-
 Karabakh. Two Georgian citizens of Armenian extraction were allegedly detained
 briefly when their plane landed in Baku en route to Tbilisi. In April the APF at-
 tempted to exchange 15 Armenians, many of whom were convicted criminals taken
 from Baku jails for Azeri civilians taken hostage by Armenian forces.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Tral.-The court system of Azerbai'an is unchanged from
 Soviet rule. There are district and municipal courts and a Supreme Court which
 serves as a court of appeals. The judiciary has been more independent since the col-
 lapse of the Soviet system. For example, he courts have consistently released people
 detained or arrested on Interior Minister Hamidov's orders.
 Generally, trials are public. Defendants have the right to be present, confront wit-
 nesses, and present evidence. The court appoints an attorney for defendants who do
 not have one. Defendants have the Tight to appeal, as does the prosecutor. The pre-
 sumption of innocence has not been incorprated into the Criminal Code. Citizens
 are no longer arrested and charged on political grounds, and there are reportedly
 no political prisoners.
 There were allegations that five Armenians, sentenced to death in April for the
 1991 murder of three Soviet soldiers and a woman journalist in Nagorno-Karabakh,
 did not receive a fair trial. It has been established that the 5 participated in the
 fatal attack; however, according to their attorneys, the prosecution never established
 that they were responsible for the murders as there were 11 other participants in
 the attack. The question as to whether they merited the death penalty is unresolved
 and has been appealed to the President. President Elchibey has publicly expressed
 his opposition to the death penalty.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-A de-
 cree issued in June, with the purpose of stopping illegal arms stockpiling, permitted
 spot searches of automobiles and residences with the procurator's approval. In some
 instances, police fired on automobiles that failed to stop and allegedly extorted
 money from those persons who did. An opposition leader alleged that some of the
 searches were political in motivation, aimed at intimidating his supporters.
 The extent to which the Soviet surveillance apparatus survives in Azerbajani
 hands is not known. The old KGB is being reorganized on a national Azerbaijani
 basis. The successor organization is the Ministry of National Security. It is widely
 believed that some phones are tapped and some mail is read.
 g. Use of Excessive Force and Violations of Humanitarian Law in Internal Con-
 flicts.-The conflict in Naqorno-Karabakh, created in 1923 as an autonomous oblast
 (province) within Azerbaijan, pits the Armenian segment of the population of the
 province (77 percent in the 1989 Soviet census) against the Government of Azer-
 batan. The Armenians, with manpower and material and moral support from Arme-
 nia, seek independence and separation from Azerbaijan. Azerbajan sees the dispute
 as a question of its territorial integrity and views itself as the victim of external
 aggression.
 The current conflict began in early 1988 with the unilateral declaration of inde-
 pendence of Nagorno-Karabakh and a resolution by the Armenian Parliament de-
 claring the annexation of the province. In February the Armenians in Nagorno-
 Karabakh began demonstrating for attachment to the territory of Armenia and forc-
 ing non-Armenians out of Armenian-controlled parts of the region, including the
 capital Stepanakert. Refugee flows and mounting ethnic tensions led to serious mob
 violence. The first of several pogroms against the roughly 350,000 Armenians resi-
 dent in Azerbaijan outside of Nagorno-Karabakh occurred in Sumgait in February
 1988. At the same time, the nearly 200 000 Azeris resident in Armenia had fled or
 been expelled from Armenia. In 1991 4oviet troops backed by Azerbaijani militia
 forcibly deported Armenians from 22 to 24 villages in Naorno-Karabakh and ar-
 rested hundreds of Armenian men. The operation was conducted with considerable
 violence. In September 1991, the Armenians of Nagorno-Karabakh proclaimed it an
 independent republic. A subsequent referendum boycotted by Azeri residents was
 overwhelmingly approved, after which the Azerbaijani Parliament revoked the au-
 tnomy of the province.
 The conflict intensified in 1992 as the Armenians gained control of the entire
 province by May and established a land corridor to Armenia, breaking a 3-year-old
 kade. he Aze    armed forces launched a mimmer counter    nive which at.
 
 
 707
 year's end continued. Both sides used excessive, indiscriminate and deliberate force
 against civilians and were responsible for wide-sale hostage-taking, the beating and
 torture of hostages, and summary executions.
 Both sides have been guilty of attacks on each others' civilians; the most serious
 was the February 25-26 attack by Armenian forces on the Nagorno-Karabakh Azeri
 town of Khojaly. According to figures compiled by the International Committee of
 the Red Cross, between 600 and 1,000 Azeris-all but 57 of them civilians-were
 killed, mostly as they and the Azeri militia interspersed with them attempted to flee
 through Armenian-held territory to the Azeri town of Agdam. Another 175 were
 missing, and a similar number were taken hostage.
 A number of visitors to Stepanakert, including journalists and members of inter.
 national human rights organizations, reported on the effects of indiscriminate Azeri
 shelling. The preconflict population had dwindled from 70,000 to 20,000. Residents
 lived in basements as many apartment buildings and dusters of homes, removed
 from military targets, were damaged and appear to have been deliberately targeted.
 The hospital complex had been destroyed. In the summer, Azerbaijani forces began
 aerial bombardment of Stepanakert. Similar scenes of destruction have occurred in
 Azerbaijani towns subjectedto Armenian artillery barrages.
 Each side also attempted to cut off the other's access to food supplies. Azerbaijan
 has blockaded Nagorno-Karabakh as a whole and Armenia since 1988, causing wide-
 spread hardship. Armenian forces blockaded Azeri enclaves within Nagorno-
 Karabakh, before eliminating them entirely in May. Finally, Armenia has blockaded
 the Azerbaijani exclave of Nakhhyvan, an autonomous republic separated from the
 rest of Azerbaijan by Armenia.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-Freedom of speech and press was generally re-
 spected especially after the June elections. The lively Azerbaijani press operated
 generally without government restriction. There were perhaps 50 local daily and
 weekly newspapers available in Baku in both Russian and Azeri. Many of these
 were the ephemeral organs of political parties, reflecting a wide range of views, both
 for and against the Government.
 In July the Government began to demand that foreign journalists and news orga-
 nizations receive permits in order to visit Nagorno-Karabakh and its environs. Ac-
 cording to Azerbaijani officials, the measure was aimed at protecting the security
 of journalists and to prevent unauthorized disclosure of militarily useful informa-
 tion. Most visiting foreign journalists have continued to receive permission to visit
 the front but under Ministry of Defense escort.
 In September and October, Interior Minister Iskandar Hamidov personally struck
 two editors who, he believed, had insulted him in their papers. The entire press con-
 demned Hamidov, and most dailies published an open letter of protest to President
 Elchibey. The President, after receiving a delegation representing the signers, re-
 sponded with his own open letter, condemning Hamidov's actions and vowing to
 guarantee Azerbaijan's free press. This was followed, however, by Hamidov's pro-
 motion to a two-star general. The Milli Majlis refused, by one vote, to place the mat-
 ter on its agenda for discussion.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-Demonstrations brought about
 the March downfall of former President Mutalibov and characterized the May
 events that led first to his return to power and then to his subsequent ouster 2
 weeks later by the APF in a nearly bloodless coup. Since the presidential elections
 in June, groups of citizens representing many political views have routinely dem-
 onstrated peacefully outside Parliament and the presidential offices. Officials did
 not interfere with or demand permits for the demonstrations. A recent decree on
 public association does require groups to register in order to function, but the Gov-
 ernment is not allowed to refise registration except in cases of known criminal ac-
 tivity..
 While the majority of demqnstrations took place without government interference,
 Interior Ministry forces did break up a Social Democratic Party demonstration on
 December 25 and another demonstration on December 31, beating some of those
 who attempted to demonstrate.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-There is no state religion. Most Azerbaijanis are Mus-
 lims, predominantly of the Shi'a sect, but there are significant Russian Orthodox
 and Jewish communities as well. All faiths practiced their religions without restric-
 tions or sanctions, with one exception: Armenian churches, many vandalized in past
 years, remained closed, and the few Armenians left in Azerbaijan would not have
 felt secure enough to attend them had they been open. Many mosques in Azerbaijan,
 closed during Communist antireligious campaigns, were reopened. There is one
 Muslim seminary; Christians and Jews must go  sewhere for clerical training. Mus-
 
 
 708
 lir clerics from Iran and Turkey, Jewish clerics from Israel and the United States,
 and Christian clerics from Russia and elsewhere were given full access to the coun-
 try.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Government did not place general restrictions on internal travel
 except for zones near the front. Foreign travel was still subject to the Soviet system
 of exit permits and passports and required an invitation from abroad in most cases.
 The Government officially recognized freedom of emigration and provided written
 guarantees to that effect. However, those Armenians and part-Armenians, mostly in
 mixed marriages, still remaining in the country reported being refused permission
 to leave the country. They allege that the Department of Visas and Registrations
 struck them off the rolls of residents and then refused to issue exit visas. According
 to some observers, the mere existence of passport checks is enough to deter some
 from attempting to leave.
 There are some 400,000 ethnic Armenian residents of Azerbaijan who are refugees
 in Armenia, Russia, and elsewhere. These people fled the country following anti-Ar-
 menian pogroms in 1988-90. It is unclear if these people will be able to return, as
 is also the case for the nearly 200,000 Azeri refugees who fled Armenia to Azer-
 baijan during the same period. Both groups of refugees complain that they were
 stripped of their possessions, movable and immovable, and received little or no com-
 pensation. An additional 150,000 Azerbaijanis have fled their homes in Nagorno-
 Karabakh and elsewhere due to continuing hostilities between Azerbaijani and Ar-
 menian forces.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Although some progress toward democracy occurred, it remains unclear to what
 extent the people of Azerbabjan have the right and ability to change their govern-
 ment by peaceful and democratic means. A series of coups and countercoups re-
 suited in the APF seizing power in May. Afterwards, presidential elections were
 held in June, resulting in the election of Abulfa Elchibey, the chairman of the APF.
 The election was internationally monitored, and while one of the candidates alleged
 fraud and several complained about the APF's monopoly of television and radio,
 international observers judged it free and fair.
 Nonetheless, Azerbaijan's declared goal of creating a secular parliamentary de-
 mocracy with an independent judiciary as well as ecks and balances on the re-
 spective branches has been impeded. In 1992 instability created by the conflict in
 Nagorno-Karabakh remained a severe obstacle to carrying out democratic reforms.
 The conflict has entrenched militias, warlords, and black marketeers, who, like the
 old Communist apparatus, resist needed change.
 The President currently shares power with a 50-member National Council (Milli
 Majlis), which was formed in 1991 under the Communist regime, with half of its
 members drawn from the opposition and half from the Communists. After the May
 15 coup, the APF dissolved the Supreme Soviet, which had been Azerbaijan's par-
 liament and transferred its functions to the National Council. Political opposition
 parties have called for new parliamentary elections as well as a new constitution
 at an early date. Both the President and the National Council are at work drafting
 a new constitution to replace the Soviet-era document still in force. Elections for a
 new parliament are anticipated in 1993.
 There were no restrictions on women or minorities participating in politics; how-
 ever, parties formed along specifically religious or ethnic lines were banned.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Local human rights observers are not repressed but they were not particularly ac-
 tive in 1992. The Government has expressed its willingness to receive delegations
 from human rights organizations. Several visited Nagorno-Karabakh in 1992. High-
 ranking government officials express a willingness to abide by the norms and obliga-
 tions of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe and other inter-
 national agreements, but they also admit that it is not easy to enforce this policy
 in a society that has been marked by decades of severe human rights abuses.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Language, or Social Status
 The Government issued several declarations and adopted one law regarding the
 protection of minority rights. The presidential decree ofSeptember 16, ado pted as
 law by*the National Council shortly thereater, called on ministers to consult enders
 of ethnic groups  take steps to ensure there is no discrimination against minorities
 in any field, and provide minorities full cultural and linguistic rights. Government
 leaders reoeatedlv stated their uolicv that Azerbaiian should remain a multiethnic
 
 
 709
 state, where all ethnic groups, including Armenians, may reside under equal citizen-
 ship rigts.
 De   e      stated gvernment policy, the estimated 18,000 Armenians and  art-Ar-
 menians still residng in Baku, most of them members of mixed marriages, lived in
 an atmosphere of fear and uncertainty. The Government was unable to guarantee
 their safety in the face of anti-Armenian sentiment. Until the APF took over in May,
 the Government appeared in some instances to dismiss minority concerns as
 overreactions. Harassment and discrimination to which Armenians were subjected
 included. the loss or denial of jobs; the canceling of pensions and other benefits; and
 the withholding of health care. In addition, the presence in Baku of hundreds of
 thousands of Azeri refugees from Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh complicated the
 situation. These refugees form a core of resentment and opposition to any official
 efforts to safeguard the rights of Armenians to live in Baku. Many of them believe
 that Armenians have no right to live in Azerbajan as long as Azeris are not per-
 mitted to live in Armenia. There have been threats against Armenians, part-Arme-
 nians, and others in mixed marriaes to leave their homes and apartments or face
 the consequences. Many have abandoned their homes, others are subjected to break-
 ins and other forms of harassment. For those who stay on in Baku, their greatest
 fear is being taken hostage (see Section 1.d.).
 While other national minorities are not as threatened, members of the large
 russophone population (500,000) report a growing sense that they have no future
 in Azerbaijan now that this once cosmopolitan crossroads is becoming increasingly
 dominated by Azerbaijani national consciousness.
 Women nominally enjoy the same legal rights as men, including the right to par-
 ticipate in all aspects of political, economic, and social life. In general, women are
 given extensive opportunities for education, work, and political activity. In practice,
 the social norms of the Caucasus are influential and tend to keep women in a subor-
 dinate position. For example, there is no restriction on women driving, and many
 women possess drivers' licenses, but it is rare to see a woman drive. Women's rights
 groups are actively trying to change these cultural norms.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Azerbaijani labor unions still operate as under the
 Soviet system. However, the Azerbaijan Labor Federation has severed its links to
 Moscow, and certain unions are the focus of antigovernment political activity and
 operate without hindrance or restriction.
 The unions, to which all workers belong, are highly dependent upon the Govern-
 ment. There is a legal right to strike, and increasingly workers are making use of
 this right. Unions and workers are not directly the subject of any human rights
 abuses. Unions are free to form federations and participate in international bodies.
 Azerbaijan was admitted to the International Labor Organization in May.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Collective bargaimng is at a
 rudimentary level; wages are still decreed by relevant government ministries for or-
 ganizations within the budget. There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced or compulsory labor is pro-
 hibited by law and is not known to bepracticed.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment o Children.-The minimum employment age is
 16. Children of 14 are allowed to work during vacations with the consent of tneir
 parents and certification of a physician. Children of 15 may work if the workplace's
 labor union does not object.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-There is a nationwide administrative minimum
 wage set by government decree. The minimum was raised several times in 1992 as
 the ruble collapsed. It is not known how effectively the minimum wage was en-
 forced. The minimum wage does not provide a decent living for a worker and family.
 However, the extended family structure's "safety net" and reliance on outside
 sources of income generally ensure a decent living. The legal workweek is 41 hours.
 Health and safety standards, exist but are by and large ignored at the workplace.
