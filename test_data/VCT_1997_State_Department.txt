 ST. VINCENT AND THE GRENADINES
 St. Vincent and the Grenadines is a multiparty, parliamentary democracy and a
 member of the Commonwealth of Nations. A prime minister, a cabinet, and a uni-
 cameral legislative assembly compose the Government. The Governor General, ap-
 pointed by the British monarch, is the titular head of state, with largely ceremonial
 powers. Prime Minister Sir James F. Mitchell and his New Democratic Party re-
 turned to power for an unprecedented third term in free and fair elections held in
 February 1994. The judiciary is independent.
 The    yal St. Vincent Police, the only security force in the country, includes a
 coast guard and a small Special Services Unit with some paramilitary training. The
 force is controlled by and responsive to the Government, but police continued to
 commit some human rights abuses.

 St. Vincent has a market-based economy. Much of the labor force is engaged in
 agriculture, in particular, banana production. Bananas are the leading export and
 a major source of foreign exchange earnings. The tourism sector is growing. How-
 ever, unemployment remains high at over 30 percent, and per capita gross domestic
 product is low, at approximately $2,766.
 Human rights are generally well respected. The principal human rights problems
 continued to include occasional instances of excessive use of force by police, the Gov-
 ernment's failure to punish adequately those responsible for such abuses, poor pris-
 on conditions, and an overburdened court system. Violence against women and
 abuse of children were also problems.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political or
 other extrajudicial killings.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution prohibits torture and other forms of cruel, inhuman, or degrading
 treatment or punishment. However, a very high percentage of convictions (estimated
 at 90 percent by the regional Caribbean Human Rights Network) continue to be
 based on confessions. A local human rights group claims that some of these confes-
 sions resulted from unwarranted police practices, including the use of physical force
 during detention, illegal search and seizure, and not properly informing those ar-
 rested of their rights. The Police Commissioner has dismissed or demoted officers
 involved in extralegal activity.
 There is no independent review board to monitor police activity and to hear public
 complaints about police misconduct. The Caribbean Human Rights Network has ad-
 vocated such a board to protect the rights of citizens complaining of these activities.
 Incidents of police brutality continued. In one case, in August police officers
 dragged a man through the streets hanging from their jeep; he suffered severe
 bruises and contusions after he refused to be taken into police custody. The police
 initially failed to provide a reason for taking the man into custody and never indi-
 cated that the man was being placed under arrest. Subsequent to the incident, how-
 ever, they charged him with resisting arrest and assaulting a police officer. These
 charges were before the court at year's end. The police concluded investigations into
 two cases of alleged police brutality brought to their attention in 1996 by the local
 human rights association, maintaining that officers involved had done nothing
 wrong. The human rights organization has not accepted this conclusion, in view of
 the evidence, including photographic evidence, of apparent brutality.
 In the aftermath of a case of particular brutality in 1996 in which a 12-year-old
 boy accused of stealing a radio was burned repeatedly by police officers but charges
 were later dropped following payment to the child's guardian of a modest sum of
 money, a bill was introduced in the House of Assembly to make it more difficult
 for cases such as this to be ompromised by the payment of compensation. The au-
 thorities dismissed two officers following this incident and disciplined two others,
 but conducted no criminal proceedings.
 Prison conditions are poor. Antiquated and overcrowded prisons, with over 400 in-
 mates in a prison designed for 75, result in serious health and safety problems.
 These conditions are particularly harsh for juvenile offenders. There is a small facil-
 ity for delinquent boys, but it is seriously inadequate and is generally used for those
 already convicted through the criminal system. Although separate legal statutes
 exist for youthful offenders, there are no separate magistrates or prosecutors to han-
 dle such cases.
 The local human rights organization brought a constitutional motion against the
 superintendent of prisons for ordering corporal punishment with a "cat-o-nine tails"
 against an inmate. The High Court found that the superintendent had no authority
 to order corporal punishment, that the cat-o-nine tails should not be used in the
 prison, and that its use represented an abuse of authority. The Government ap-
 pealed the decision to the Eastern Caribbean Court of Appeal.
 The Government permits prison visits by independent human rights monitors.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution provides for persons de-
 tained for criminal offenses to receive a fair hearing within a reasonable time by
 an impartial court. Although there are only two official magistrates, the registrar
 of the High Court and the presiding judge of the family court now effectively serve
 as magistrates when called upon to do so. While this reduced the backlog, com-
 plaints remain regarding police practices in bringing cases to court. Some defense
 
 
 649
 attorneys claim this has caused 6- to 12-month delays in preliminary inquiries for
 serious crimes.
 There were no reports of instances of arbitrary arrest, detention, or exile.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution provides for an independent and
 impartial court, and the judiciary is independent in practice.
 The judiciary consists of lower courts and a High Court, with appeal to the East-
 ern Caribbean Court of Appeal and final appeal to the Privy Council in the United
 Kingdom.
 The Constitution provides for public trials. The court appoints attorneys for indi-
 gent defendants only when the defendant is charged with a capital offense. Defend-
 ants are presumed innocent until proven guilty and may appeal verdicts and pen-
 alties. There is a large backlog of pending cases, because of delaying tactics by law-
 yers as well as the overburdened judicial system.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution prohibits arbitrary search and seizure or other government intrusions
 into the private life of individual citizens, and there were no reports of such abuses.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech
 and the press. There are two major newspapers and numerous smaller, partisan
 publications; all are privately owned, and most are openly critical of the Govern-
 ment's policies. There were no reports of government censorship or interference with
 the operation of the press. However, individual journalists critical of the Govern-
 ment have on occasion found themselves denied professional opportunities, including
 training and advancement.
 The lone television station in St. Vincent is privately owned and operates without
 government interference. Satellite dishes are popular among those who can afford
 them. There is also a cable system with mainly North American programming that
 has about 300 subscribers. The Government controls programming for the govern-
 ment-owned radio station.
 The Government does not restrict academic freedom.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 these rights, and the Government respects them in practice.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the
 Government respects this right in practice.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The law provides for these rights, and the Government respects them
 in practice.
 No formal government policy toward refugee or asylum requests exists. The issue
 of the provision of first aslyum did not arise. There were no reports of forced expul-
 sion of anyone having a valid claim to refugee status; however, government practice
 remains undefined.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens have the right to change their government through regularly scheduled
 free and fair elections. St. Vincent has a long history of multiparty parliamentary
 democracy. During the last elections in 1994, the two opposition parties united to
 challenge the ruling New Democratic Party. The effort was successful to the extent
 that the "Unity" coalition won 3 of 15 parliamentary seats-the NDP held all 15
 prior to the election. The opposition continues to charge that the ruling party has
 not complied with what the opposition asserts is a constitutional obligation to an-
 swer questions it puts forth in the Legislative Assembly.
 Two of the 15 members of Parliament are women. The same two women hold min-
 isterial portfolios in the current Government.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Opposition political groups and the Vincentian press often comment on human
 rights matters of local concern. The St. Vincent and Grenadines Human Rights As-
 sociation, affiliated with the regional Caribbean Human Rights Network, closely
 monitors government and police activities, especially with respect to treatment of
 prisoners, publicizing any cases of abuse. The Government is generally responsive
 to public and private inquiries about its human rights practices.

 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution provides for equal treatment under the law regardless of race,
 sex, or religion, and the Government adheres to this provision.
 Women.-Violence against women, particularly domestic violence, remains a
 major problem. The Government took legislative steps to address this problem
 through the Domestic Violence/Matrimonial Proceedings Act (1994) and the more ac-
 cessibe Domestic Violence Summary Proceedings Act (1995). Both laws provide for
 protective orders, as well as occupation and tenancy orders, although the former is
 only accessible through the High Court, whereas the latter can be obtained without
 the services of a lawyer in family court. A local human rights group conducted nu-
 merous meetings throughout the country during the year to familiarize citizens with
 their rights under these acts.
 Depending on the magnitude of the offense and the age of the victim, the penalty
 for rape is generally 10 or more years in prison. In May 1995, the legislature
 amended the Child Support Law to allow for payments ordered by the courts even
 though notice of an appeal has been filed. Previously, fathers who had been ordered
 to pay child support could appeal decisions and not pay while the appeal was being
 head. This resulted in a huge backlog of appeal cases and effectively reduced the
 number of mothers and children receiving support payments.
 The Ministry of Education, Youth, andVomen's Affairs has a women's desk which
 assists the National Council of Women with seminars, training programs, and pub-
 lic relations. The minimum wage law specifies that women should receive equal pay
 for equal work.
 Children.-Education is not compulsory, but the Government states that it inves-
 tigates cases where children are withdrawn from school before the age of 16. Al-
 though the Government has played a more prominent role in legislating health and
 welfare standards since independence, the infant mortality rate is still very high.
 One underlying cause is the large number of children born to teenage mothers.
 The Domestic Violence Summary. Proceedings Act provides a limited legal frame-
 work for the protection of children. Nevertheless, reports of child abuse remain high.
 The Social Welfare Office is the government agency responsible for monitoring and
 protecting the welfare of children. The police are the enforcement arm-the Social
 welfare Office refers all reports of child abuse to the police for action. Marion
 House, a social services agency established by the Catholic Church in 1989, provides
 counseling and therapy services.
 People With Disabilities.-There is no specific legislation covering persons with
 disabilities, and the circumstances for disabled individuals are generally difficult.
 Most severely disabled people rarely leave their homes because of the poor road sys-
 tem and lack of affordable wheelchairs. The Government partially supports a school
 for the disabled which has two branches. A separate, small rehabilitation center
 treats about five persons daily.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution provides citizens the right to form
 unions and to organize employees, while the Trade Unions and Trade Disputes Act
 allows the right to strike. Employers often ignore the constitutional provisions that
 provide for union rights, and claim that they have a constitutional right not to rec-
 ognize a trade union. Some employers, however, seek a good industrial relations en-
 vironment and cooperate with trade unions. There were no major strikes.
 Unions have the right to affiliate with international bodies.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-There are no legal obstacles
 to organizing unions; however, no law requires employers to recognize a particular
 union as an exclusive bargaining agent. Some companies offer packages of benefits
 with terms of employment better than, or comparable to, what a union can normally
 obtain through negotiations. The law prohibits antiunion discrimination by employ-
 ers against union members and organizers. Generally effective mechanisms exist for
 resolving complaints. The authorities can order employers found guilty of antiunion
 discrimination for firingworkers without cause (including for participation in union
 activities) to reinstate the workers or give them severance pay.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Corpulsory Labor.-The Government prohibits forced
 or ompulsory labor, and it is not known to occur. The Government does not specifi-
 cally prohibit forced or bonded labor by children, but there were no reports that it
 occurred.
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment.-The law
 sets the minimum working age at 16 years of age, although a worker must be 18
 years of age to receive a national insurance card. The labor inspection office of the
 
 
 651
 Ministry of Labor monitors and enforces this provision, and employers generally re-
 spect it inpractice. The age of leaving school at the primary level is 15 years; when
 ese pupis leave school, they are usually absorbed into the labor market disguised
 as apprentices. The Government does not specifically prohibit forced or bonded labor
 by children, but there were no reports that it occurred (see Section 6.c.). There is
 no known child labor except for children working on family-owned banana planta-
 tions, particularly during harvest time, or in family-owned cottage industries.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The law sets minimum wages, which were last
 promulgated in 1989. They vary by sector and type of work and are specified for
 several skilled categories, including attendants, packers, cleaners, porters, watch-
 men, and clerks. In agriculture the wage for workers provided shelter is $0.82
 (EC$2.25) per hour;, skilled industrial workers earn $7.36 (EC$20) per day, and un-
 skilled workers earn $3.68 (EC$10) per day. In many sectors the minimum wage
 is not sufficient to provide a decent standard of living for a worker and family, but
 most workers earn more than the minimum. The Wages Council, according to law,
 should meet every 2 years to review the minimum wage, but it has not met for the
 last 7 years. There is no legislation concerning the length of the workweek; however,
 the general practice is to work 40 hours in 5 days. The law provides workers a mini-
 mum annual vacation of 2 weeks.
 According to the Ministry of Labor, legislation concerning occupational safety and
 health is outdated. The most recent legislation, the Factories Act of 1955, has some
 regulations concerning only factories, but enforcement of these regulations is ineffec-
 tive. Workers enjoy a reasonably safe working environment; however, the trade
 unions have dealt with some violations relating to safety gear, long overtime hours,
 and the safety of machinery. There were some reports of significant visual deficiency
 by visual display unit workers, and some reports of hearing impairment by power
 station and stone crushing employees.
