 CAMBODIA
 Cambodia completed its third year under democratic rule after 20 years of civil
 war and authoritarian or totalitarian regimes. The transition to a democratically
 elected government followed the signing of the Paris Peace Accords by Cambodia's
 
 
 608
 rival factions in 1991, which led to free and fair elections administered by the Unit-
 ed Nations in May 1993 and the promulgation of a constitution in September 1993.
 The Royal Government of Cambodia (RGC) is a coalition composed primarily of the
 FUNCINPEC party, which won the largest number of votes in the 1993 election and
 the Cambodian People's Party (CPP), which had ruled the country since the ouster
 of the Khmer Rouge (KR) by the Vietnamese army in 1979. The leader of
 FUNCINPEC, Prince Norodom Ranariddh, and former State of Cambodia Prime
 Minister Hun Sen of the CPP are first and second Prime Ministers, respectively.
 King Norodom Sihanouk is the constitutional monarch and Head of State. Most
 power lies with the executive branch; the judiciary is not independent in practice.
 The Khmer Rouge, which signed the Paris Accords but refused to implement
 them, continued to wage a mostly low-level guerrilla insurgency against the Govern-
 ment. However, the Khmer Rouge appeared to be seriously weakened by an internal
 split when top official leng Sary entered into defection negotiations with the Gov-
 ernment on behalf of a breakaway KR faction in August. In September King
 Sihanouk acted upon a request from the co-Prime Ministers and granted amnesty
 to Ieng Sary. The amnesty applied to a death sentence issued by a 1979 war crimes
 tribunal in Cambodia and a 1994 law outlawing the Khmer Rouge.
 The police have primary responsibility for internal security, but the Royal Cam-
 bodian Armed Forces (RCAF), including the military police, a so have domestic secu-
 rity responsibilities. The Government continued to integrate former FUNCINPEC
 and Buddhist Liberal Democratic Party personnel into the police force. The Govern-
 ment also continued to implement a reform plan to improve RCAF and police per-
 formance. Members of the security forces committed human rights violations, for
 which they were rarely prosecuted.
 Cambodia has a market economy in which approximately 80 percent of the popu-
 lation engages in subsistence farming, with rice as the principal crop. The country
 has a small, but growing, garment industry. Foreign aid is an important source of
 national income. Cambodia s annual per capita gross domestic product is $260.
 Significant problems remained in many human rights areas. There continued to
 be reports of numerous abuses. The security forces committed extrajudicial killings,
 and there were credible reports that members of the security forces tortured, beat,
 and killed detainees. Prison conditions remained poor, and arbitrary arrest, pro-
 longed detention, and infringement on citizens' privacy rights were problems. Politi-
 cal intimidation of journalists and members of the political opposition also occurred.
 The Government lacked the resources or the political will to act aggressively against
 individuals, particularly members of the military services who were suspected of
 being responsible'for such abuses.
 The Government sometimes limits press freedom; it prosecuted several journalists
 critical of the Government, although all eventually received royal pardons. Fear of
 government-directed violence against the press and government pressure created a
 climate that encouraged self-censorship by some journalists. A prominent opposition
 party was harassed by security forces, leading to concern about government intoler-
 ance toward opposing political viewpoints. Emerging democratic institutions, par-
 ticularly the judiciary, remain weak. The judiciary is subject to influence by the ex-
 ecutive and marred by inefficiency, a lack of training, a shortage of resources, and
 corruption related to low wages. Irregularities in the legal system continued, and
 citizens were effectively denied the right to a fair trial. Domestic violence against
 women and children is common. The ethnic Vietnamese minority faced widespread
 social discrimination and some violence from the Khmer Rouge; people with disabil-
 ities also faced societal discrimination. The Government does not adequately enforce
 existing legal prohibitions against antiunion discrimination, nor provisions outlaw-
 ingforced labor.
 Citizens living in areas controlled by the Khmer Rouge were denied virtually all
 political rights and were subject to serious human rights abuses by the KR leader-
 ship. KR forces committed numerous extrajudical killings and were responsible for
 disappearances, forced labor, and restriction of freedom of speech, the press, assem-
 bly, association, religion, and movement.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There was no evidence of a govern-
 ment-sponsered campaign of violence. However, there were more than 30 reported
 cases of police, local government, or military involvement in killings of civilians, pos-
 sibly including the deaths of a journalist, provincial political workers, and other ci-
 vilians. The authorities made few arrests in connection with these crimes, due to
 a combination of ineffective law enforcement, intimidation of civilian authorities by
 
 
 military personnel, and in some cases a lack of prosecutorial vigor. Elements of the
 police and military forces were associated with a large number of violations, espe-
 cially in Battambang province. Victims of extrajudicial killings were often young
 male civilians accused of crimes and subsequently killed while in police custody.
 In January police in Kompong Chain province tortured and killed Liv Peng An,
 a suspect in a rape case. According to human rights investigators, Peng An was
 handcuffed, starved, and beaten for 3 days before dying. Family members who had
 come to visit him were only allowed to see Peng An after he was killed. Although
 the police claimed Peng An committed suicide by hanging, an abbot who prepared
 the body for burial said that it showed evidence of beating, including broken ribs.
 Following intervention by a human rights nongovernmental organization (NGO) and
 Peng An s family, the Ministry of Interior allowed Peng An's body to be exhumed.
 Investigators determined that he had been killed by torture. No one has been
 charged.
 In May, Am Han, a resident of Svay Por district in Battambang province, died
 after 3 days in police custody. Han was arrested on suspicion of supporting the
 Khmer Rouge and was tortured, and eventually killed, in an attempt to force him
 to confess to crimes he did not commit, according to human rights workers. Police
 officials asserted that Han committed suicide by hanging. Seven men suspected in
 Han's killing have been charged and face trial.
 In May journalist Thun Bunly, editor of the Khmer Ideal newspaper and a mem-
 ber of the opposition Khmer Nation Party (KNP), was shot to death by two men
 while riding a motorcycle taxi in central Phnom Penh. A government investigation
 has thus far failed to identify the murderers. Also in May, Khem Khin, a KNP mem-
 ber, sustained a fatal beating by an unknown assailant while walking to his house
 in Siem Rap provine. No one has been charged in the killing. In June local KNP
 leader Seun Sim was shot and killed by six armed men while he and his wife were
 sitting in front of their home in Chrey village, Siem Reap province. No suspects
 have be en detained. In November Ros Chhem, a FUNCINPEC party candidate for
 provincial office, was killed by unidentified gunmen in Kandal province. A police
 identification has not yet identified any suspects. Koy Samuth, a Ministry of Inte-
 rior official and the brother-in-law of SecondPrime Minister Hun Sen, was shot and
 killed in November by two gunmen in Phnom Penh. Police were investigating the
 case at year's end, but had brought no charges.
 Alleged connections with the Khmer Rouge were used as justification in at least
 two fatal incidents involving police and local villagers. In May local police killed a
 child and injured 15 adults when they arrested a group of villagers accused of being
 Khmer Rouge members in Lobeuk village, Kampot. In June, three farmers in Mong
 Russey district, Battambang provine, were killed by three soldiers who accused
 them of being Khmer Rouge members. The Ministry of Interior suspended three po-
 licemen invoved in the Lobeuk case; no government action was taken in the Mong
 Russey case.
 In May miitary polie killed two residents of Bong Roy village, Svay Rieng prov-
 ince, in a revenge  lling. They claimed that thieves had kille their relatives and
 asked local villagers to identify the murderers. The military police killed one vil-
 lager identified by his neighbors, then killed another under similar circumstances
 the next day. No government action was taken.
 Eight civilians were killed by a communal chief and six communal militiamen in
 a February incident at Andeuk Island in Koh Kong province. Nine armed bandits
 who burglarized the house of a village chief in Koh Kong were followed into the jun-
 gle by several armed vllagers, who killed one of the bandits in a gunfire exchange.
 Two days later, local police led by communal chief Seng Sao arrested six of the eight
 thieves, as well as two log cutters who happened to be in the vicinity. The two re-
 maining thieves escaped. Those arrested were then detained in the district jail
 where district chief Phai Thuon Phiankesorn apparently instructed Seng Sao and
 six communal militiamen to kill the six persons in custody.
 Local fishermen discovered the eight bodies in a cave at Andeuk Island. Seng Sao
 was then arrested on orders from te first deputy governor of the province, but the
 six militiamen escaped to Thailand. Officials from the Ministries of Interior and De-
 fense investigated the killings but did not release any findings. Seng Sao was finally
 released from the Koh Kong provincial jail in late February, allege~ly following the
 intervention of Koh Kong governor Rung Plain Kesorn. Seng Sao has since escaped
 to Thailand.
 Colonel Sath Soeun, charged by the provincial court in Kompong Chain for the
 killing of a journalist and a boy in two separate incidents in 1994 and 1995, contin-
 ues to serve in theprovincial army. Soeun was tried and acquitted for the murder
 of journalist Chan Dara in 1994. A warrant was issued for his arrest following his
 1995 killing of a 16-year-old boy, but he has not been apprehended.
 
 
 610
 The Khmer Rouge continued to abduct and kill civilians. One of the most serious
 incidents occurred in June, when a group of 37 KR guerrillas abducted approxi-
 mately 50 wood cutters in Kampot province. Although 31 of the workers were later
 released in exchange for ransom money, the KR reportedly murdered 14 of the hos-
 tages. In Jul Khmer Rouge forces abducted 25 villagers in Siem Reap province;
 they later killed 21 of them. The KR also targeted ethnic Vietnamese, killing 25 citi-
 zens of Vietnam in August (see Section 5).
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 However, there were at least a dozen cases in which the Khmer Rouge reportedly
 abducted local villagers, often for periods of 2 weeks to 1 month. Abductees were
 typically required to provide forced labor.
 InMarch a group of 26 demining workers were kidnaped by KR soldiers in Siem
 Reap province. The KR later released all but two of the hostages: Christopher
 Howes, a British citizen, and his Cambodian interpreter Houn Hoerth. It is not
 known whether Howes and Hoerth are still alive.
 Also in March, nine soldiers and military police charged in the 1995 kidnaping
 of casino executive Lim Kim Hock received jail sentences for the crime. Hock was
 kidnaped and held for 2 days before being released unharmed.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degradin  Treatment or Punishment.-
 The 1993 Constitution prohibits torture and physica abuse of prisoners. The Gov-
 ernment does not systematically use torture, but there were credible reports that
 security officials occasionally used torture and often beat criminal detainees se-
 verely, particularly during interrogation. One Cambodian human rights NGO docu-
 mented 14 cases of torture committed by police, military, or local authorities be-
 tween March and August. Another Cambodian human rights NGO investigated 36
 cases of torture commit ted under similar circumstances between January and June.
 In at least two instances, such torture resulted in the deaths of suspects by beat-
 m&nditions in many prisons remain poor. The Government continued efforts to im-
 prove prison conditions but has been hampered by lack of funds. The U.N. Center
 for Human Rights, the U.N. Secretary General's Special Representative for Human
 Rights, and an international NGO cited a number of serious problems, including
 overcrowding, food and water shortages, malnutrition, and poor security. Human
 rights workers reported that the practice of using shackles and holding prisoners
 in small, dark cells, a practice thought virtually eliminated by the U.N. Transitional
 Authority in Cambodia (UNTAC), continued in some prisons. Government ration al-
 lowancs for purchasing prisoners' food have not increased for 2 years and are in-
 creasingly inadequate.
 The Government continued to allow human rights groups to visit prisons and to
 provide human rights training to prison guards.
 Although an alleged illegal detention faciity in Battambang province was closed
 in 1994, there were unconfirmed reports of the existence of small, illegal detention
 facilities in several provinces.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution prohibits arbitrary ar-
 rest, detention, and exile. A Penal Code drafted by UNTAC and approved by the
 interim Supreme National Council remains in effect, as does a criminal procedure
 law dating from the State of Cambodia period. The Criminal Procedure Law in the-
 ory provides adequate protection for criminal suspects, but in practice the Govern-
 ment frequently ignored these provisions. Cambodian human rights investigators
 documented at least 23 cases of illegal detention and arrest committed by police,
 militar, or local government authorities through November.
 While lengthy detention without charge is illegal, suspects are often held by au-
 thorities for long periods before being charged. Accused persons are legally entitled
 to a lawyer, although in practice they often have no access to legal representation.
 Many judges believe that lawyers must be appointed only in criminal felony cases.
 In family cases, parties are frequently not informed about their legal rights by the
 courts. Prisoners are routinely held for several days before gaining access to a law-
 yer or family members. Although there is a bail system, many prisoners, particu-
 larly those without legal representation, often have no opportumty to seek release
 on bail. The introduction into the legal system of a corps of defenders who work
 without fee, and who are trained by NGO's, resulted in significant improvements
 for those defendants who were provided with counsel, including  a reduction in their
 retrial detention period and improved access to bail. For example, 34 percent of
 defendants were acquitted in 242 legal cases involving such nonlawyer defenders
 trained by one international NGO. Human rights groups report that judges made
 progress in informing suspects of their rights.
 The Government generally did not use detention without charge as a means of
 political control; however, there were several instances of detention used against the
 
 
 opposition KNP. In January police conducted a raid on KNP headquarters in Phnom
 Penh as part of a search for two witnesses to a car theft who were alleged to be
 inside the headquarters building. Journalists, human rights workers, and KNP staff
 members were detained in the headquarters building for 42 hours before the police
 allowed them to leave. In March two KNP party workers were arrested by the police
 in Siem Reap province and accused of distributing propaganda on behalf of the
 KNP. Provincial authorities determined that the two party workers had not broken
 any law; they were released from custody after 1 day's detention; the case was
 dropped. In May three KNP workers in Kandal province were arrested and held for
 2 days by local police on charges of illegally recruiting members for the KNP. The
 three were released following intervention by human rights groups.
 It remained easy for the Government to obtain detention warrants from the courts
 quickly.
 Exile is prohibited by the Constitution and is not practiced.
 No lega system is known to exist in Khmer Rouge zones. Khmer Rouge forces
 often seize hostages in order to intimidate villagers into cooperating with them.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution provides for an independent judi-
 ciary. However, in practice, the Government does not ensure an independent judici-
 ary. The courts are subject to influence by the executive, and there is widespread
 corruption among judges, virtually none of whom receives a living wage.
 The court system consists of lower courts, an appeals court, and a Supreme Court.
 The Constitution also mandates a Constitutional Council, which is empowered to re-
 view the constitutionality of laws and a Supreme Council of Magistrates, which ap-
 points and disciplines judges. These two bodies have not yet been established due
 to disputes between the two major parties concerning their composition. Human
 rights workers indicate that there has been incremental progress in establishing ju-
 dicial independence, however. Civilian courts are often unable to try members of the
 military forces. Courts must obtain Ministry of Justice permission to prosecute
 members of the civil service, including the police. Human rights groups report that
 in practice ministries often decline to respond to the courts or refuse their requests
 for prosecution. Delays in responding to the courts' requests sometimes allow those
 accused of crimes to flee in order to escape prosecution.
 A serious lack of resources and poor training contribute to inefficiency in the judi-
 cial branch, and in practice the Government does not ensure due process. For exam-
 ple, judges often lack copies of the laws on which they are expected to rule. As a
 result of these weaknesses, citizens were often effectively denied the right to a fair
 trial.
 There is also a military court system, which suffers from deficiencies similar to
 those of the civilian court system.
 The Government continued its ongoing work with a variety of foreign donors and
 NGO's to improve the functioning of the legal system.
 The courts often pressure victims of crimes to accept small cash settlements from
 the accused. When a case does make its way to court, the verdict is often deter-
 mined by a judge before the case is heard, sometimes on the basis of a bribe paid
 by the accuser or the defendant. Sworn, written statements from witnesses and the
 accused are usually the extent of evidence presented in trials. Often these state-
 ments result from beatings or threats by investigating officials, and illiterate de-
 fendants are often not informed of the content of written confessions that they are
 forced to sign. In cases involving military personnel, military officers often exert
 pressure on judges to have the defendant released.
 Trials are public. Defendants have the right to be present and to consult with an
 attorney, to confront and question witnesses against them, and to present witnesses
 and evidence on their own behalf. However, trials are typically perfunctory, and ex-
 tensive crss-examination usually does not take place. The serious shortage of attor-
 neys is somewhat alleviated by the provision of nonawyer defenders trained by
 international human rights organizations. Defendants are also legally entitled to the
 presumption of innocence and the right of appeal. Because of extensive corruption,
 however, defendants are often expected to bribe the judge for a favorable verdict and
 are therefore effectively denied the presumption of innocence.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution contains provisions protecting the privacy of residence and correspond-
 ence and includes a provision against illegal search. There were, however,
 unconfirmed reports that the Government arbitrarily monitored private electronic
 communications. According to human rights observers, the police routinely con-
 ducted warrantless searches and seizures. Although people were largely free to live
 where they wished, there were charges that in September the Government forcibly
 
 
 612
 removed hundreds of residents of Phnom Penh's "Borei Keila" district without ade-
 quate compensation.
 The Government does not coerce or forbid membership in political organizations.
 However, membership in the Khmer Rouge, which is conducting an armed insur-
 gency against the Government, is ilegal.
 g. Use of Excessive Force and Vioiations of Humanitarian Law in Internal Con-
 fiicts.-Fighting between government and Khmer Rouge forces continued; however,
 negotiations between the Government and various Khmer Rouge commanders se-
 cured the defection of thousands of Khmer Rouge soldiers and civilians in the north-
 west and contributed to a reduction in armed conffict during the second half of the
 year. Government soldiers used alleged connections with the Khmer Rouge as jus-
 tification for attacks on civilians in areas near Khmer Rouge zones (see Section L.a.)
 As in previous years, many civilians were killed or wounded by indiscriminate
 shelling and by land mines laid by both sides. Villages were subjected to burning
 and looting by the Khmer Rouge. These attacks had escalated following an October
 1994 Khmer Rouge policy decision to harass local officials and terrorize the local
 population, although recent defections and the ongoing cease-fire in the northwest
 decreased the level of violence in many areas during the year.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of expres-
 sion, press, and publication, but the Government sometimes limits press freedom in
 practice. The Constitution implicitly limits free speech by requiring that speech not
 adversely affect public security. The Constitution also declares that the King is "in-
 violable. A press law in effect since 1995 provides journalists with a number of
 rights, including a prohibition on prepublication censorship and protection from im-
 prisonment for expressing opinion.
 However, the law includes a vaguely worded prohibition on publishing articles
 that affect national security and political stability. These provisions were strongly
 criticized by human rights groups and journalists. A draft government subdecree on
 this matter in May was criticized by human rights groups and journalists because
 it did not provide specific definitions of "national security" and "political stability,"
 and because it added a training requirement for those interested in becoming jour-
 nalists. The Government continued to revise the draft subdecree; however, it banned
 the establishment of new newspapers until the subdecree was completed. This ban
 was in contradiction of the press law. Three new newspapers have been established
 since July, including one opposition newspaper.
 Cambodia's news organizations, including over 50 newspapers, remained active,
 and many frequently criticized the Government. Most newspapers were nominally
 independent, but many received financial support from political parties. The Gov-
 ernment, the military forces, and political parties continued to dominate the broad-
 cast media. The Government refused to allow the KNP, which has not been legalized
 by the Government, to have its own television and radio stations. Although many
 newspapers remained critical of the Government, fear of violence against the press
 and government pressure created a climate that encouraged self-censorship by some
 journalists. There are three journalists' associations; they lobbied for more liberal
 press regulations and against the detention of jurnalists.
 The Government continued its intimidation of newspapers which were overtly crit-
 ical of government actions, although this intimidation was not so extensive as in
 past years. There have been no arrests in the killing of KNP politician and journal-
 ist Thun Bunly in Phnom Penh, who was shot by unknown attackers (see Section
 l.a.). Journalist Sum Dara of the New Angkor newspaper was detained and beaten
 by two armed men in Phnom Penh in August. The police interrogated Dara about
 the activities of other journalists before releasing him. Using the press law, the Gov-
 ernment suspended publication of the antimonarchy Republic News for 78 days. The
 newspaper reopened following intervention by the League of Cambodian Journalists
 and continued its critical viewpoint. Journalists Chan Rotana and Hen Vipheak,
 sentenced to prison terms in 1995 for separate violations of press regulations, were
 pardoned and released from prison in July and August, respectively. Both served
 less than 1 week of their prison terms. Their newspapers continued to publish and
 remained critical of the Government. There were seven reports that journalists re-
 ceived threatening telephone calls from political interests opposed to their news-
 papers' editorial views.
 The media reported that the Government issued a directive instructing teachers,
 including private school teachers, not to talk about politics in class. There continues
 to be      ition of discussion of some political issues at the University of Phnom
 Penh.
 
 
 613
 The Khmer Rouge do not allow freedom of speech or press in zones they that con-
 trol.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 freedom of peaceful assembly and freedom of association.
 In May heavily armed government security forces confronted the funeral proces-
 sion of slain journalist Thun Bunly (see Section L.a.) when it attempted to divert
 from its authorized course through central Phnom Penh. There was no violence, and
 the funeral procession proceeded along its authorized route without incident.
 Provincial farmers protesting poor agricultural cpnditions were turned away from
 the royal palace and the Ministry of Interior by security personnel in June.
 Although several provincial offices of the KNP remain open, others had their
 opening ceremonies disrupted by local police or were otherwise harassed after open-
 ngn October demonstration organized by the KNP against the state visit of Gen-
 eral Than Shwe, leader of Burma's State Law and Order Restoration Council, was
 not approved by government officials. KNP protesters were diverted by plice and
 dispersed peacefully. Two policemen were injured when a car occupied by KNP lead-
 er Sam Rainsy's driver and bodyguard attempted to pass a police roadblock. Police
 reportedly beat the driver and detained him briefly before releasing him. Rainsy's
 bodyguard was arrested, convicted of destroyin government property, and impris-
 oned 23 days. In November KNP protests took place without incident.
 The Government requires local NGO's to register with the Ministry of Interior.
 No action has been taken against unregistered NGO's, however. A draft NGO law,
 prepared with assistance from the U.N. Center for Human Rights, has not yet been
 passed by the National Assembly.
 In Khmer Rouge-controlled areas, freedom of assembly and association do not
 exist.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of religion and
 prohibits discrimination based on religion. The Government respects this right in
 practice. Buddhism is the state religion.
 The Khmer Rouge have traditionally banned or discouraged religion.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Government does not restrict international travel or within the
 parts of the country that it controls, although the presence of land mines and ban-
 dits make travel in some areas perilous.
 Government security forces operate numerous security checkpoints along major
 highways. There were reports that Vietnamese citizens were routinely harassed by
 these soldiers and forced to pay bribes on Route 5 near Kompong Chang.
 Tens of thousands of citizens who are ethnic Vietnamese fled Cambodia in early
 1993 due to racial violence directed at Vietnamese. Many returned after the elec-
 tions. However, the authorities stopped and forbade entry to occupants of several
 thousand boats on the Mekong River. Most of these people have been allowed to re-
 turn, while others entered informally.
 The Government allows noncitizens to apply to the United Nations High Commis-
 sioner for Refugees (UNHCR) for refugee status in Cambodia. However, in Decem-
 ber, the Government expelled 19 ethnic Vietnamese to Vietnam after detaining
 them for alleged involvement in a political organization called the People's Action
 Political Party of the Vietnamese People. The Government asserted that this organi-
 zation was part of the illegal Free Vietnam Movement. Nine of the 19 had already
 requested political asylum from the UNHCR office in Phnom Penh.
 The Government did not provide first asylum in 1996. The small number of re-
 quests made were still pendg by year's end. The Government did, however, pro-
 vide first asylum in 1995. The Government has not yet fully formulated a policy re-
 garding refugees, asylees, or first asylum.
 The Khmer Rouge, who refused to comply with the Paris Accords by opening the
 areas they control, continued to restrict access to, from, and within these zones.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The Constitution provides for the right of citizens to change their government,
 and most citizens exercised this right by participating in the 1993 U.N.-adminis-
 tered elections. In those areas of the country controlled by the Khmer Rouge, citi-
 zens cannot exercise this right.
 In the 1993 election, each province elected National Assembly members through
 proportional representation. Some 20 parties took part; 4 won seats. The United Na-
 tions certified the election as free and fair. After the drafting of a constitution, the
 constituent assembly became the National Assembly. Members of all four parties
 
 
 that won seats in the Assembly entered a coalition government, which remained in
 power through 1996.
 The legislature was weak in comparison with the executive branch. All legislation
 considered or adopted by the National Assembly originated in the ministries. The
 Government appointed the provincial governors and their deputies, who are divided
 between the two coalition parties. District and commune officials are also appointed
 by the executive branch; most of these officials are People's Republic of Kampuchea
 or State of Cambodia appointees. FUNCINPEC has complained that district chief
 positions are not equally divided between the two major coalition parties. Com-
 munal elections are scheduled for late 1997. The Government has prepared a draft
 communal electoral law, but it has not been presented to the National Assembly.
 International election advisers were received by government officials, including
 the Prime Ministers.
 Traditional cultural practices inhibit the role of women in Government. There are
 7 women among the 120 members of the National Assembly. Although there are no
 female Governors or Cabinet ministers, there are a few women at the state sec-
 retary and deputy governor levels. There are several members of ethnic and reli-
 gious minorities in the Cabinet and the National Assembly.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Cambodia's large international and domestic human rights community, which
 first began operating under UNTAC, remained active and engaged in diverse activi-
 ties. Numerous human rights organizations and the U.N. Center for Human Rights
 conducted highly effective human rights training for military officers, villagers, the
 legal community, and other groups. There are approximately 40 NGO's involved in
 human rights activities, some of which carried out investigations of abuses.
 According to a study made by an international NGO, however, only 9 of the 40
 NGO's have a primary focus on human rights and civic education. According to
 NGO leaders, communication between human rights NGO's and the executive
 branch of the government continued to improve. Most NGO's reported little overt
 intimidation, although many felt that the sensitive issues that they covered required
 them to exercise caution in carrying out their activities.
 The National Assembly's Human Rights Commission, headed by a former NGO
 leader, served as a liaison between the Assembly and the human rights community.
 The Commission began using its own investigators during the year and conducted
 high profile human rights investigations in the provinces.
 One domestic human rights organization reported limited cooperation from some
 provincial authorities in conducting inspections of prison conditions.
 Followingthe signing of a memorandum of understanding with the Government
 in March, the U.N. Center for Human Rights extended its mandate for 2 additional
 years. The U.N. Secretary General's Special Representative for Human Rights,
 Thomas Hammarberg, was received by both of the co-Prime Ministers.
 The Khmer Rouge do not permit any investigation of human rights violations in
 their zones. Many international and indigenous NGO's have made plans to enter the
 Khmer Rouge defector zones in the northwest as soon as the area is fully secured
 by the Government.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution prohibits discrimination based on race, color, sex, language, reli-
 gious beliefs, or political views. Although the Government does not systematically
 engage in discrimination, it often fails to protect these rights in practice.
 Women.-International and Cambodian NGO workers report that violence against
 women, including rape and domestic violence, is common. There were reports of
 rape, but there were no statistics available on this problem. A study by an inter-
 national NGO released in July estimates that one in six wives is physically abused
 by her husband, and half of those are injured. Authorities normally decline to be-
 come involved in domestic disputes. There are some indications that stress and
 other psychological problems originating during the Khmer Rouge period of the
 1970's contribute to the problem of violence against women. NGO's reported that
 prostitution and trafficking in women were serious problems. The Government
 passed a law against prostitution and trafficking in January, but human rights
 groups indicate that it is not adequately enforced.
 According to an international labor NGO's report, women now comprise 55 per-
 cent of the population, but 60 percent of agricultural workers, 85 percent of the
 business work force, 70 percent of the industrial work force, and 60 percent of all
 service sector workers. Women are often concentrated in low-paying jobs in these
 
 
 615
 sectors and are largely excluded from management positions, which remain domi-
 natedby men.
 The Constitution contains explicit language providing for equal rights for women,
 equal pay for equal work, and equal status in marriage. In practice, women have
 equal proprty rights with men, have the same status in bringing divorce proceed-
 ings, and have equal access to education and some jobs. However, cultural traditions
 continued to limit women's ability to reach senior positions in government, business,
 and other areas. There are a large number of women's NGO's, which concentrated
 on training poor women and widows and addressing social problems such as spousal
 abuse and prostitution. Within the Government, the Secretariat of State for Wom-
 en's Affairs is responsible for women's issues.
 Children.-The Constitution provides for children's rights, and ensuring the wel-
 fare of children is a specific goal of the Government's political program. However,
 the Government relies on international aid to fund most social welfare programs
 targeted at children, resulting in only a modest flow of resources to ameliorate prob-
 lems affecting children. Children frequently suffer from the inadequacy of the health
 care systemnant mortaity is reported at 115 per thousand and nearly 20 percent
 of children do not live to the age of 5. Child mortality from preventable diseases
 is high.
 Children are also adversely affected by the inadequate educational system. Only
 around 1 percent of primary school teachers have completed high school. Schools are
 overcrowd   an  short of equipment. The Government does not deny girls equal ac-
 cess to education, but in practice, families with limited resources often give priority
 to educating boys.
 Child abuse is believed to be common, although there are no statistics on the ex-
 tent of the problem. Studies conducted by human rights organizations indicate that
 child prostitution became increasingly widespread during the year, although it is
 difficult to gauge the extent of the problem. There were reliable reports that girls
 were kidnaped in several provinces and forced into the illegal sex trade, both in
 Cambodia and abroad.
 People With Disabilities.-The Government does not mandate accessibility for peo-
 ple with disabilities to buildings or government services. According to international
 human rights groups, 1 in 236 Cambodians is missing at least one limb. This figure
 reflects the continuing effects of land mines on the population. Programs adminis-
 tered by various NGO's have brought about dramatic improvements in the treat-
 ment and rehabilitation of amputees. However, they face considerable societal dis-
 crimination, particularly in obtaining skilled employment.
 National IRaciallEthnic Minorities.-Citizens of Vietnamese and Chinese eth-
 nicity have long comprised the largest ethnic minorities. Ethnic Chinese are well ac-
 cepted. However, fear and animosity continue toward ethnic Vietnamese people, who
 are seen as a threat to the Cambodian nation and culture.
 The rights of minorities under the nationality law passed in August are not ex-
 plicit; constitutional protections are extended only to "Khmer People," that is, Cam-
 bodians.
 There were reports that Vietnamese nationals were singled out for harassment at
 illegal government security force checkpoints (see Section 2.d.).
 LyChandara, a Cambodian national of Vietnamese ethnicity, was arrested and
 expelled to Vietnam in March after being accused of serving as the deputy Com-
 mandr-in-Chief of the Free Vietnam Movement, which the Government charges
 carried out illegal activities against the Government of Vietnam. Two others, a
 Cambodian and a Vietnamese resident of Cambodia, were expelled with Chandara
 on the basis of similar charges. Chandara was the editor of the Vietnamese Lan-
 guage newspaper Tudo, which was closed by the Government in December 1995.
 handara was later released by the Government of Vietnam and allowed to return
 to Cambodia.
 Several thousand ethnic Vietnamese fled to the Vietnam- Cambodia border follow-
 ing massacres in early 1993. By the end of the ear, man had in fact returned to
 their homes, while a few remained stranded on the border (see Section 2.d.).
 The Khmer Rouge continued a calculated campaign of inflammatory propaganda
 directed against ethnic Vietnamese, and there were reports that 25 citizens of Viet-
 nam were killed as part of a Khmer Rouge ethnic cleansing campaign in August.
 In May a group of 20 armed men killed 11 Vietnamese and 1 Cambodian, and
 wounded 8 others, in an ethnically motivated attack on a village in Pursat province.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Government finalized its draft of a new labor
 law with assistance from the International Labor Organization (ILO) and the Asian
 American Free Labor Institute (AAFLI). The legislation provides for internationally
 
 
 616
 accepted labor rights, including the right to organize and bargain collectively. The
 National Assembly passed the new law in January 1997.
 The 1992 Labor Law dates from the State of Cambodia period. Workers have the
 right to form worker organizations of their choosing without previous authorization,
 and employees in each workplace are required to select a single worker representa-
 tive. In practice, management or the Government usually controls the selection proc-
 ess for the worker representative. Worker organizations are not required to join a
 single trade union structure under the 1992 law.
 There were few active independent trade unions. The majority of salaried workers
 are employed by the State athough there is a growing services sector. A large pro-
 portion of the urban populaon n is engaged in low-level commerce or self-employed
 skilled labor. The code does not apply to workers in the public sector.
 h. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The 1992 Labor Law provides
 for collective bargaining, although any age nt reached betweea workers and em-
 ployees is subject to government approva. In practice, collective bargaining does not
 tak~e place. The Government sets wages for civil servants. Wage rates in other sec-
 tors are based largely on market conditions and are set by employers. The 1992
 Labor Law prohibits antiunion discrimination by employers, but there is no mecha-
 nism for enforcing this provision.
 Opposition politician Sam Rainsy announced the formation of the Free Trade
 Union of Cambodian Civil Servants in November. Hundreds took p art in a dem-
 onstration without incident. Another union, the Free Trade Union of Khmer Work-
 ers, formed in December and organized a walkout from a foreign-owned garment
 factory.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The 1992 Labor Law prohibits
 forced or compulsory labor and contains penal sanctions for offenders. However, the
 Government does not adequately enforce these provisions. There were credible re-
 ports that workers have been coerced into working overtime, and there were some
 reports of women being forced to work as prostitutes.
 The Khmer Rouge compel people under their control to serve as porters for mili-
 tary and other supplies and to clear land for farming (see Section 1.b.).
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The 1992 Labor Law states that
 the minimum age for employment is 16 years, except for those workers in family
 enterprises. Although penalties exist for violation of these provisions, the Govern-
 meat has not established an apparatus to enforce them. Youth under the age of 16
 years routinely engage in a variety of jobs, including street trading, construction,
 agriculture, and manufacturing.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The 1992 Labor Law does not provide for a na-
 tionwide minimum wage but requires a wage that assures a decent living standard.
 The Government does not enforce this requirement. In practice, the wage is often
 set by employers. Market-determined wage rates at lower levels are not sufficient
 to provide a decent living for a worker and famly.
 The new labor legislation requires the Government to set and periodically revise
 a minimum wage, and at year's end the Government was in the process of prparing
 a decree that would set the Kingdom's first minimum wage.
 The 1992 Labor Law provides for a standard legal workweek of 48 hours and a
 24-hour rest period, andrequires overtime pay. The Government does not enforce
 these standards, and workers commonly wok more than 48 hours per week. Se
 workers incur salary deductions if they do not perform overtime or holiday work.
 The Law states that the workplace should have health and safety standards ade-
 quate to ensure workers' weil-being. However, the Government has not yet set spe-
 cific standards, and work-related injury and health problems are common. Penalties
 are specified in the law, but there are no provisions to protect workers who com-
 plain about unsafe and unhealtbful conditions. Conditions in factories and small-
 scale industries are generally poor and often do not meet international standards.
