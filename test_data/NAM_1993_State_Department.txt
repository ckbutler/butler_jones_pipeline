 NAMIBIA
 Namibia is a functioning multiparty, multiracial democracy, whose Constitution
 contains an entrenched bill of rights providing for freedom of speech, press, assem-
 bly, association, and religion. The Government is headed by President Sam Nujoma,
 leader of the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO), which won Na-
 mibia's first free elections in November 1989. While SWAPO enjoys majority control
 in both houses of Parliament, the multiparty opposition exercises its responsibilities
 freely and vigorously.
 The main security force is the Namibian Defence Force (NDF), comprising former
 troops of the People's Liberation Army of Namibia (PLAN--SWAPO's military wing)
 and the South West African Territorial Force (SWATF) that battled each other prior
 to independence. NDF and police members were accused, and in some cases con-
 victed, of crimes against civilians during the year.
 The Namibian economy has two major components-a modern market sector that
 produces most of its wealth and a traditional subsistence agricultural sector (mainly
 in the north) that supports most of its labor force. Mining, ranching, and fishing,
 the mainstays of the market sector, are still largely controlled by white Namibian
 businessmen. The Government continued to stress the leading role of the private
 sector and encouraged new investments by indigenous and foreign entrepreneurs on
 the basis of the investment code adopted in December 1990.
 Namibians enjoy a wide range of civil, political, and economic liberties. Con-
 troversy continued, however, over SWAPO's incomplete accounting for missing de-
 tainees formerly held in Angola and Zambia during the preindepen ence period. The
 Government's restrictive policies on refugees and the alleged forced deportations of
 asylum seekers were also criticized. Preindependence problems of racial discrimina-
 tion and disparities-especially in education, health, employment, and working con-
 ditions-continued in 1993, despite efforts by Government to reduce inequities.
 While the Constitution prohibits discrimination based on race and other factors, a
 number of apartheid-based laws related to areas such as property, business, and
 labor, dating from before independence, have not yet been repealed or replaced and
 remain valid. Limited measures were taken to try to reduce societal violence and
 other discrimination against women, but serious inequities remained. A number of
 police and defense force members were charged, convicted, and dismissed from serv-
 ice for criminal offenses against civilians, including murder, assault, and theft but
 there continued to be instances of such abuses.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Resped for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political or
 other extrajudicial killings during 1993. Several cases of political killings which oc-
 curred prior to independence, including that of SWAPO activist Anton Lubowski,
 who was assassinated in Windhoek in September 1989, remained unsolved. The con-
 fidential police investigation into Lubowski's killing, completed in May 1993, was
 passed to the magistrate's court for inquest proceedings, which had not taken place
 by year's end. A local newspaper alleged, however, that high-ranking officials of the
 preindependence police and military forces planned his killing. The officers named
 in the allegation have brought court action against the newspaper under libel laws.
 b. Disappearance. -There were no reports of disappearances occurring during
 1993. Nevertheless, attention continued to be focused on the disappearances of per-
 sons detained by SWAPO prior to independence. The number of SWAPO detainees
 still unaccounted for ranges from 154 to 256. Controversy surrounding this issue is
 likely to continue until the Government conducts and releases the results of a full
 investigation.
 In Jane the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) issued its final re-
 port on its tracing efforts, which ran from November 1991 to April 1993. The ICRC
 noted that SWA1() responded to only a small fraction of the ICRC's inquiries during
 that period and urged family members to approach SWAPO directly for additional
 informoation.
 AnoLher outstanding issue is whfther persons deemed responsible for )ast human
 righi.- abuse.- woud b he!d legally accountable and whether current government
 cificials credib!) l-nked to serious human rights abuses in the preindependence pe-
 riod should be permnitted to remain in office.
 c. Torture aond Oher Cruel, Inhu-nan, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution t.ates that "no persons shall be subject to torture or to cruel, inhu-
 -ean, or degraing treatment or punishnirnt." However, there were over 20 allega-
 
 
 tions of torture or other abusive treatment by police and security forces during 1993.
 These incidents were all highly publicized locally.
 Controversy erupted in March when Simon Ananias, a NDF member convicted of
 the murder of a 10-year-old boy in Rehoboth in 1990, was released under a presi-
 dential pardon. Ananias had served only 4 months of a 10-year sentence at the time
 of the pardon. Opposition political parties and the press criticized the fact that of
 over 500 prisoners released at the same time, Ananias was the only one convicted
 of a violent crime.
 In April a former SWAPO detainee alleged that he was stopped by a joint police/
 NDF patrol in Windhoek after his vehicle ran out of gas. The individual alleged he
 was singled out for questioning after being recognized as a former detainee, forced
 into a police van, blindfolded, and taken to an unknown location, where he was se-
 verely beaten and interrogated about his loyalties to the SWAPO Party. He was de-
 tained in the city jail overnight on drunk driving charges before being released the
 following day. The individual subsequently filed charges against the police and the
 NDF ana is Ling represented by the Legal Assistance Centre (LAC). Senior govern-
 ment officials claimed, however, that the individual's injuries were sustained in an
 ongoing altercation at the time of police arrival. The case was pending in the courts
 as the year ended.
 In another case, three NDF members carried out the unprovoked beating of a
 farming couple near the northern town of Outjo in late June, using a tire iron and
 empty bottle. The three soldiers were arrested and charged with assault by the civil-
 ian courts. The case had not yet come to court by the end of the year.
 In September a female refugee at the Osire camp formally charged a police official
 with assault, torture, and degrading treatment. She also alleged that at least two
 police and camp officials knew of male refugees raping women in the camps and al-
 lowed the crimes to continue unabated and without official intervention. The Na-
 tional Society for Human Rights (NSHR) agreed to press her case in court. She has
 since left Namibia, and court authorities are unable to prosecute the case without
 her participation. Other refugees also said they were reluctant to report cases of
 mistreatment by police and camp officials because they feared alleged "trouble-
 makers" would be arbitrarily deported.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution forbids arbitrary arrest
 or detention, and the Government has generally respected these provisions. Accord-
 ing to the Constitution, persons who are arrested must be informed of the reason
 for their arrest "promptly in a language they understand," and they must be
 brought before a magistrate within 48 hours of their detention. A trial must take
 place within "a reasonable time,* or the accused must be released. The accused are
 entitled to defense by a legal counsel of their choice; the state provides a lawyer
 for the indignt.
 Some tradtional leaders, however, reportedly continued to detain and imprison
 persons accused of minor offenses without recourse to police or judicial review. The
 vernment repeatedly condemned these actions and called upon the public to re-
 port such practic es to the authorities. It also undertook to train traditional leaders
 in the constitutional exercise of their powers.
 There were no reports of Namibians being exiled for political reasons in 1993.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Tria/.-Namibia has an independent judiciary. Under the
 Constitution all citizens have the right to a fair trial, and this right is afforded in
 practice. Namibia has retained the Roman-Dutch court system it inherited from
 outh Africa, while also maintaining a traditional court system. The formal system
 has three levels: magistrate's court the High Court, and the Supreme Court. The
 last also serves as the court of appeals and as a constitutional review court. The
 tenure of sitting judges was not affected by the 1990 change of government.
 Traditional courts have long dealt with minor criminal offenses, such as ptty
 theft and infractions of local customs, among members of the same ethnic group.
 A special presidential commission, created in 1991 to make recommendations on the
 prospective jurisdiction of traditional courts, presented its findings to the President
 April. It concluded that traditional cultural practices and structures should be
 maintained, provided they were consistent with constitutional protections and exist-
 ing laws. Enabling legislation was drafted in late 1993 with respect to the powers,
 duties, and functions of traditional leaders, and the establishment of "community
 to bridge the existing gap between traditional and magistrates' courts. This
 legislation had not yet been presented to Parliament as the year ended.
 The Constitution provides guarantees that persons claiming that their fundamen-
 tal rights have been violated may seek redress in court and request free legal advice
 from the ombudsman. The lack of sufficient, qualified magistrates, however, contin-
 ued to exacerbate the backlog of cases awaiting trial. Other delays resulted from the
 lack of legal counsel-fewer than 100 lawyers were engaged in private practice in
 
 
 Namibia in 1993; fewer than 10 of these were black. The Government appointed the
 first public defender in July and provided renewed funding under its legal aid
 scheme to permit indigent defendants equal access to legal representation. During
 the year, the Government, in conjunction with the University of Namibia, also es-
 tablished a "Justice Training Centre," which is to provide additional legal training
 to magistrates and community court officials.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution provides all citizens with the right to privacy and requires arresting
 officers to secure a judicial warrant for certain listed offenses before conducting a
 search. These rights were respected in practice.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for these fundamen-
 tal freedoms including academic freedom in institutions of higher learning, and
 states that these rights may not be suspended except in time of war or during a
 state of emergency. In practice, these freedoms are respected.
 The government-owned Namibian Broadcasting Corporation (NBC) operates vir-
 tually all radio and television services. A broadly representative government-ap-
 pointed board sets policy for the NBC. Although the NBC routinely gave prominent
 covwrage to the activities of government officials, it also provided significant cov-
 erage to the opposition and viewpoints critical of the Government. During the year,
 an independent media board was established to review applications and award radio
 and television licenses to private companies. One such community radio station"
 was established in Windhoek in 1993 and began broadcasting. Print journalism in
 Namibia remained free and vigorous. During the year, four dailies, two biweeklies,
 and three weekly newspapers of general interest were published. There was no ap-
 parent self-censorship by journalists, aside from the constraints of libel and pornog-
 raphy laws. There were no restrictions on academic freedom.
 b. Freedom of Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for freedom
 of assembly and association. During 1993, various organizations including political
 parties and religious groups, held large meetings and public gatherings without in-
 terference. Police permits are required for large, publicized public gatherings, and
 there was no indication that any such permit requests were denied. Other sponta-
 neous public gatherings, including protests to local governments over inadequate po-
 lice protection against criminals, particularly thieves and cattle rustlers, took place
 without incident.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-There is no state religion and no restrictions on the ac-
 tivities of particular religious groups or on foreign clergy members.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Constitution guarantees the rights to move freely throughout Na-
 mibia, to reside and settle in any part of the country, and to leave and return. These
 rights are respected in practice. Nevertheless, the local press, local nongovernmental
 organizations (NGO's), and opposition political parties repeatedly criticized the Gov-
 ernment's handling of citizenship and refugee issues.
 Much of the criticism focused on the lack of a consistent refugee or asylum policy.
 At midyear, the Cabinet recommended that the Government accede to the 1951 U.N.
 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees and the 1967 Protocol, and the 1969
 Organization of African Unity (OAU) Convention, as had been urged by the U.N.
 High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and local human rights organizations.
 Legislation to this effect is expected to be considered in Parliament for debate and
 enactment in early 1994. The Government expressed prior reservations, however,
 over Article 26 of the 1951 Convention (concerning freedom of movement and resi-
 dence). Such reservations effectively kept virtually all refugees, including 519 of the
 total of 569 recognized by both the Government and UNHCR, at the Osire refugee
 camp, located in a remote area some 120 miles northeast of Windhoek. Refugees are
 prohibited from working outside the refugee camp. Those discovered to be working
 were arrested for immigration violations. The only exception to the requirement to
 reside at Osire involved beneficiaries of UNHCR scholarships, who could reside and
 study at the University of Namibia in Windhoek.
 The NSHR and opposition political parties alleged that a number of persons seek-
 ing refugee status were deported or jailed under ordinary immigration law upon
 their arrival in Namibia. These reports, involving as many as 100 people, could not
 be independently substantiated. An interministerial government committee reviews
 refugee and asylum claims on . case-by-case basis. Between January and September
 1993, this committee reviewed 67 cases, and 5 candidates had been accepted as refu-
 gees. Six cases were denied, while 56 were still pending final determinations in late
 1993.
 
 
 201
 Opposition parties accused the security forces of abducting several dozen Na-
 mibian citizens and residents and delivering them to Angola for conscription into
 that country's armed forces. The Government stated that only undocumented Ango-
 lan nationals were involved, all of whom had agreed to return to Angola. Because
 the Angola/Namibia border is relatively open and arbitrarily divides several ethnic
 groups, there is often confusion as to who is "Angolan" and who is "Namibian".
 Repatriation from Botswana of the descendants of Herero speakers who fled Na-
 mibia during the 1904-07 war against the Germans commenced in mid-1993. Ap-
 proximately 1,600 persons had entered the country by mid-September. Under this
 program, several thousand persons may ultimately resettle in Namibia with govern-
 ment assistance and obtain Namibian citizenship.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The Constitution stipulates the right of citizens to change their government, and
 this right is enjoyed in practice. All adult Namibians are able to participate in the
 political process.
 The Constitution established a bicameral Parliament and provides for free general
 elections by secret ballot every 5 years and regional elections every 2 years. Na-
 tional elections held in 1989 and 1992 were characterized as generally free and fair.
 Seven political parties are represented in the National Assembly. The SWAPO.
 led Government has 45 of the 78 seats and the Democratic Turnhalle Alliance
 (DTA), the major opposition party, holds 21 seats. Five small parties are also rep-
 resented. The DTA together with the other non-SWAPO parties in Parliament can
 block constitutional changes, which require a two-thirds majority of all members.
 The National Council, the upper house of Parliament, consists of 19 SWAPO mem-
 bers and 7 DTA representatives.
 Women have become increasingly involved in the political process. Three women
 hold positions at the cabinet or subcabinet level. Several women hold seats in the
 Parliament. Women's groups are active in civic and political activities.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Local organizations such as the National Society for Human Rights (NSHR) and
 the Legal Assistance Centre (LAC) operated freely, criticizing the Government's
 handling of the SWAPO detainee issue, the treatment of refugees, misconduct by
 members of the police and defense forces, and other matters.
 The LAC, which also focused on legal education and women's rights, continued to
 work with the Ministry of Education and Culture in developing a constitutional cur-
 riculum for schools and offered lectures on human rights issues for police cadets and
 defense force trainees.
 International human rights organizations were free to travel to Namibia and dis-
 cuss human rights issues with governmental and nongovernmental representatives.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 Women.-Women's rights are protected by the Constitution, but discrimination
 against women, stemming from pervasive cultural and traditional practices of all
 races, persisted. Several women's groups continued to seek an end to these inequal-
 ities and took particular exception to the fact that men are not required to provide
 economic support for their children in case of divorce, resulting in many indigent
 single mothers. Government leaders were sympathetic but had not introduced nec-
 essary amending legislation in Parliament by year's end. During 1993, the tradi-
 tional leaders of several indigenous ethnic groups stated that they would honor a
 nonbinding parliamentary resolution condemning the traditional practice of family
 members confiscating property and other assets of deceased men from their widows
 and children.
 Nevertheless, residual inequalities in the law and in education and employment
 opportunities continued. For example a woman is considered a ward of her father
 until she marries, at which time s e becomes a ward of her husband. Any property
 brought into a marriage by a woman is transferred to the ownership of her husband,
 who has the authority to decide its disposition without her consent. Under existing
 community property laws, married women of all groups are defined as legal minors
 and need written consent of the husband before they may legally acquire or pur-
 chase property or enter into a legal contract. Women were not barred from pursuing
 higher education but, due to prevailing social norms, remained primarily in the cler-
 ical, secretarial work, teaching, medical, and domestic service fields.
 Violence against women remained widespread, particularly physical beating and
 rape. Because of traditional attitudes regarding the subordination of women, many
 
 
 202
 cases of spousal assault were not reported to the authorities. Women's groups and
 other women's rights advocates claim that police do not seriously pursue cases of
 spousal rape and assault, stating that they preferred not to interfere in domestic
 dsputes. These groups also noted that prosecutions of and convictions for rape are
 rare. In September a man was sentenced to 5 years imprisonment for murdering
 his common-law wife. In the widely publicized verdict, the judge said a wife was not
 her husband's property. In July the Namibian police openea Women and Child
 Abuse Centre in   in  oek, with specially trained female officers to assist victims
 of sexual assaults.
 Children.-Children's rights are enumerated and guaranteed in Article 15 of the
 Constitution. In practice, the Government has committed as many resources as its
 limited means allow for the protection of children's welfare. In 1993 the Government
 allocated 29 percent of its total budget (a proximately $250 million) to education
 and other significant amounts to health andschool feeding programs.
 The police and courts vigorously prosecuted cases involving crimes against chil-
 dren, particularly rape and incest. These issues were also discussed in printed mate-
 rial given wide distribution in Namibian schools. The Women and Child Abuse Cen-
 tre" (see above) also assisted in reducing the trauma suffered by abused children
 and in training police officials to handle this problem sensitively.
 Indigenous People.-The Government continued to promote the civil, political, and
 economic rights of the indigenous majority of Namibians, who were deprived of land
 and many other rights during the recently ended colonial era. It has implemented
 affirmative action and other programs to provide equal education and employment
 opportunities to all of its citizens. The San people, Namibia's earliest inhabitants,
 have also been traditionally exploited by other indigenous ethnic groups. The Gov-
 ernment has endorsed the San's rights to land and traditional land-use patterns and
 supported the first regional meeting of Southern Africa's indigenous San, held in
 1993. The Ministry of Education and Culture also worked with the Nyae Nyae De-
 velopment Foundation, a local NGO, to ensure that primary school teaching mate-
 rials took San cultural sensitivities into account.
 During 1993, the Government (encouraged by members of the indigenous major-
 ity) also confirmed the principle that indigenous traditional cultural practices, in-
 cluding the dispensation of justice, allocation of communally held lands, and selec-
 tion of leaders, were permissible, provided they were not in conflict with the coun-
 try's Constitution. Nonetheless, many indigenous Namibians were unprepared to ex-
 ercise fully their civil and political rights as a result of their historically minimal
 access to education and economic opportunities under South African rule, coupled
 with their relative isolation in remote farming areas.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-The Constitution prohibits discrimination
 based on race and other factors and specifically prohibits "the practice and ideology
 of apartheid." As a result of many years of South African administration, racial and
 ethnic discrimination were institutionalized in Namibian society and racial discrimi-
 nation continues. Many apartheid-based statutes which predate Namibia's inde-
 pendence remain valid until repealed or replaced by the Parliament. Nonwhites
 complained that the Government was not moving quickly enough to mitigate the
 continuing and serious inequalities in education, health, housing, employment, and
 use of public accommodations.
 Although several racial and ethnic groups charged the Government with bias to-
 ward the numerically dominant Ovambo ethnic group, these claims could not be ob-
 jectively substantiated. Some Afrikaans speakers alleged that the Government's pol-
 icy of using English as the medium of instruction in schools violated their "cultural
 rights." In addition, leaders of the "Baster" community in Rehoboth alleged that the
 Government had unconstitutionally appropriated communal lands at independence.
 These charges were pursued through the courts, which had not yet rendered deci-
 sions as of late in the year.
 People with Disabilities.-There were no reports of official discrimination on the
 basis of disability. With limited financial resources, the Government attempted to
 provide the disabled with treatment and education. Several local NGO's also were
 active in helping the disabled to become more socially and economically self- suffi-
 cient. Although the Government did not require special access to public buildings
 for the disabled, some municipal governments, including those of Windhoek and
 Swakopmund, have installed ramps and special curbing at street crossings for the
 disabled.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Namibia's Constitution provides for freedom of asso-
 ciation, including freedom to form and join trade unions, a right that was extended
 to public servants, farm workers, and domestic employees under a comprehensive
 
 
 labor law. Trade unions have no difficulty registering, and there are no government
 restrictions on who serves as a union official. No union has been dissolved by gov-
 ernment action.
 Unions are independent of government and may form federations and confed-
 erations of which two are significant. The principal trade union organization is the
 National Union of Namibian Workers (NUNW), a SWAPO-aligned federation of 7
 industrial unions with 70,000 members. Most workers in the mining industry, the
 country's key export sector, are members of the NUNW-affiliated Mineworkers
 Union of Namibia (MUN). The principal public service and construction unions are
 affiliates of the Namibia People s Social Movement (NPSM), formerly known as the
 Namibian Christian Social Trade Unions Confederation. There are also several inde-
 pendent trade unions. The bulk of the trade union movement maintains close affili-
 ation to SWAPO and the Government. Several prominent NUNW officials serve on
 SWAPO's Central Committee, and union leaders have served in the National As-
 sembly. The NPSM and other independent unions claim to be nonpartisan and in
 practice confine their activities to labor-management relations. Rou-hly half of the
 wage sector is organized to some degree, although many workers within this group
 are only employed part-time. Less than 20 percent of those wage earners employed
 full-time are organized, and few rural laborers are organized.
 Namibian workers, except for those providing essential services (e.g., jobs related
 to public health and safety), enjoy the right to strike, once conciliation procedures
 have been exhausted. The Labor Act extended the right to strike to public servants,
 farm workers, and domestics. Under the Act, strike action can only be used in dis-
 putes involving worker interests, such as pay raises.
 Disputes over worker rights, including dismissals, must be referred to the Labor
 Court (which has yet to be established) for arbitration. The Labor Act also led to
 the creation of the Office of the Labor Commissioner which mediates nonjudicial
 solutions to labor disputes arising among workers, employers, and government.
 Legally striking workers also gained protection from unfair dismissal under the
 Labor Act. An "unfair dismissal" is defined as one in which a "valid or fair reason"
 for termination or dismissal is "not in compliance with fair procedure." Because by
 year's end no one had yet challenged a dismissal as unfair under the law, it is un-
 clear what "unfair" means in practice. Since independence, work stoppages over pay,
 dismissal, and pension issues have been relative y' common, with most actions last-
 ing 1 day or less. Job actions of this type have occurred less frequently within the
 past year. However, in November Namibia witnessed its longest strike since inde-
 pendence, the 2-week work stoppage at Consolidated Diamond Mines (CDM) in
 Oranjemund.
 The strike began on November 15 after negotiations between CDM management
 and the Mineworkers' Union of Namibia (MUN) over an increase in pay ended in
 stalemate. Initially, CDM offered an 8.5 percent basic increase, while the MUN had
 demanded 15 percent. From the outset, the work stoppage was acrimonious, and
 there were several reported injuries on the picket lines when nonunion CDM work-
 ers and the striking mine workers confronted each other. Several days into the
 strike negotiations stalled as charges of "illegal picketing" and "assault" were raised
 by CIaM, while the union contended that the mine was hiring on a new, "strike
 breaking" work force. CDM also insisted that its workers in essential services be
 allowed to cross picket lines. From the mine's perspective, essential services in-
 cluded such areas as public health and safety, food preparation and basic operation
 of the mine's infrastructure and utilities. The union countered that management's
 definition of "essential" was too encompassing, although the two sides ultimately
 compromised. The strike, which involved 3,500 workers and idled 5 on-shore mining
 facilities, was finally settled on November 29, when the parties agreed to a 10-per-
 cent wage increase for union members.
 The work stoppage was costly for all concerned, in terms of lost profits, wages,
 and revenue to the Government. Yet in spite of the apparent costs, the protracted
 strike was viewed by many as a major test case for the interpretation of Namibia's
 1992 Labor Act. These sentiments were summed up by one union leader as follows:
 "It seems that the (Labor) Act has got a lot of loopholes. On face value, the Act ap-
 pears to favor the union but in practice it does not, nor does it favor the company."
 aMor inistry officials announced in late December that the Government will in-
 troduce legislation in 1994 to clarify certain provisions of the Labor Act, particularly
 those relating to overtime and essential services.
 Trade unions are free to exchange visits with foreign trade unions and to affiliate
 with international trade union organizations. The unions have exercised this free-
 dom without interference.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The 1992 Labor Act guaran-
 tees employees the right to bargain individually or collectively. Collective bargaining
 
 
 204
 is not widely practiced outside the mining and construction industries; wages are
 usually set by employers. As unions become more active, however, informal collec-
 tive baraining is becoming more common.
 The Labor Act provides a process for employer recognition of trade unions and
 protection for members and organizers. The law also empowers the Labor Court to
 remedy unfair labor practices and explicitly forbids unfair dismissals, which can
 also be brought on appeal to the Labor Court.
 When a dispute cannot be resolved directly, the first recourse is to a conciliation
 board, with a mediator and representatives from both sides. The Office of the Labor
 Commissioner plays an integral role. Conciliation boards have been used mostly in
 wage disputes and, to a lesser extent, to negotiate working conditions, overtime
 hours, and reinstatements of dismissed employees. In almost all cases in which con-
 ciliation boards have been convened, the disputes were settled.
 If, however, agreement cannot be reached via the current conciliation board route,
 the aggrieved parties have the option to strike, stage a brief protest walkout, or re-
 turn to work (or continue to seek a solution via the conciliation board). Furthermore,
 the (current) law is not clear on what the parties in a dispute should do in instances
 in which they are not granted access to a conciliation board by the Labor Commis-
 sioner. The Government is considering district labor courts as an alternate venue
 for the resolution of disputes.
 Yet, even with the new Act, business-labor relations remain, for the most part,
 strained. The unions appear to have little effective control over the mass of
 seniorganized, mostly black, urban unskilled workers, who are frustrated with the
 vestiges of the apartheid system which remain from the preindependence period.
 The only export processing zone (EPZ) is located in Arandis, where special tax in-
 centives are available for export-oriented industrial developments. The Government
 has no plans to suspend the provisions of the Labor Act in the EPZ as a means of
 attracting foreign investment.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced labor is prohibited by law.
 Although there were no formal complaints filed with the Ministry of Labor in 1993,
 there were continuing reports that farm workers sometimes receive inadequate com-
 pensation for their labor and are subject to strict control by farm owners. There
 were also reports in previous years of some farm workers being subjected to physical
 punishment by their employers. Farm workers experienced great difficulties in gain-
 ing recognition of their working rights, due to the isolation of many rural areas and
 the resulting obstacles to organizing trade unions. Moreover, it is sometimes dif-
 ficult for Ministry of Labor inspectors to gain access to Namibia's expansive, pri-
 vately owned commercial farms in order to document possible Labor Code violations.
 There have also been reports that Namibian crews on fishing vessels have been
 required to work excessive hours without proper compensation or time off.
 d.Minimum Age of Employment for Children.-Under the 1992 Labor Act, the ab-
 solute minimum age for employment was 14 years, with higher requirements for
 certain sectors, such as 16 years for mining, manufacturing, and construction, 17
 for underground work, and 18 for night work. Age regulations under previous legis-
 lation were generally enforced. However, children below the age of 14 often work
 on family and commercial farms and in the informal sector. Boys in the rural areas
 traditionally start herding livestock at age 7. The Labor Act empowers Ministry of
 Labor inspectors to enforce the prohibitions on child labor. Once they become estab-
 lished, the labor courts will be able to hear criminal charges against violators.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-There is no statutory minimum wage law in
 Namibia. The Labor Act provides for wage commissions to consider proposals for
 sectoral or geographical minimum wages. Unskilled workers in the relatively well-
 p aid mining sector earn about twice the amount earned by urban unskilled laborers.
 Domestic workers earn much less. In Windhoek's nonwhite townships, workers and
 their families have difficulty maintaining a minimally decent standard of living.
 White Namibians earn significantly more on average than their black compatriots,
 in large part because whites own most of the country's productive resources and had
 preferential access to education that enabled them to take advantage of the skilled
 labor shortage. Moreover, under the preindependence apartheid system, even quali-
 fied nonwhites were often barred from skilled jobs or did not receive equal pa for
 equal work. The Government is aggressively attempting to address this pro lem
