 LESOTHO
 On January 20, 1986 the regime of Prime Minister Leabua
 Jonathan, in power since independence, was ousted by the
 Lesotho Paramilitary Force (LPF). The coup leaders established
 a Military Council, abolished the post of Prime Minister, and
 formally conferred all legislative and executive power on
 Moshoeshoe II, the previously powerless King of Lesotho. The
 military leaders and the King rule by decree but appointed a
 mix of civilians and military officers to a restructured
 Council of Ministers to administer the day-to-day operations
 of the new Government. The new regime banned "political
 activity" for an unspecified period.
 The reasons for the military takeover, led by Major General
 J.M. Lekhanya, were complex but were rooted in the fact that
 the Jonathan regime, which itself had illegally seized power
 in 1970 after adverse electoral results, had alienated not
 only key Basotho power elements but also the general
 population. In addition, the South Africans had virtually
 closed the land borders because of concerns over African
 National Congress (ANC) cross-border operations and were
 publicly threatening more direct action if the Jonathan
 Government did not root out ANC presence in Lesotho.
 A landlocked country completely surrounded by South Africa,
 Lesotho is almost entirely dependent on South Africa for trade,
 finance, and employment. About half of the male labor force is
 employed in South African mines, and remittances from workers
 ($250-$300 million annually) are of key importance in the
 economy, especially in financing imports.
 The new Government adopted a policy of national reconciliation
 upon its assumption of power and did not engage in harsh
 reprisals against members of the former Government. It called
 for the return of Basotho nationals who had exiled themselves
 for political or economic reasons in the past, although Ntsu
 Mokhehle, the exiled leader of the Basotho Congress Party and
 the outlawed Lesotho Liberation Army (LLA) rejected the
 government's general amnesty. In 1986 there was a vast
 improvement in personal security with the disarming of
 nonpolice and nonmilitary personnel undertaken after the coup.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section I Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There have been three incidents since December 1985 which
 involved political killings. In early December 1985, three
 citizens of Lesotho and six South African exiles were killed in
 a nighttime raid in Maseru by unidentified assailants.
 Reportedly, the perpetrators of these killings were assassins
 operating against suspected ANC members and/or sympathizers.
 In March 1986, two senior officers of the Royal Lesotho
 Defense Force (formerly Lesotho Paramilitary Force), awaiting
 trial on charges stemming from events surrounding the January
 1986 coup, died mysteriously while in prison. Despite many
 rumors, there has not been a credible explanation for these
 killings. The authorities claimed that both men died of
 natural causes, but the results of the autopsies and of
 further investigations were never publicized.
 
 
 LESOTHO
 Former Minister of Information Desmond Sixishe and former
 Minister of Foreign Affairs Vincent Makhele, along with their
 wives, were abducted from the home of Mrs. Sixishe's sister on
 November 15, 1986, taken to a mountain road, and murdered.
 The two former ministers were among the principal radicals in
 the Jonathan cabinet. The police investigation into the crime
 was continuing at the end of 1986 amidst much public
 speculation as to perpetrators and motives, e.g., the settling
 of old scores by Basotho or the possibility of action by an
 LLA or a South African assassination team. Some observers
 speculated on possible Military Council involvement or
 complicity in the crime.
 b. Disappearance
 The reports of known disappearances during 1986 concerned
 several refugees from South Africa who reportedly were lured,
 or perhaps kidnaped, by elements operating from South Africa
 and reportedly taken across the border into the Republic of
 South Africa. There have been no credible reports of
 disappearances of Basotho nationals.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 The advent of the new military Government resulted in a
 decrease in the number of allegations of improper police and
 military conduct. While it is probable that some beatings and
 harsh interrogations, particularly of criminal suspects,
 continued to take place, the new Government does not condone
 torture or other forms of cruel or harsh treatment by police
 or military authorities. Incidents of police abuses that do
 occur are believed to be. the result of overzealousness at
 lower levels and lack of proper supervision.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Since the January coup, the treatment of civilian and military
 personnel associated with the Jonathan regime has generally
 been good. There were several periods of interrogation of
 some former ministers, but there were no instances of
 politically motivated arrest and/or prolonged jail detention
 or evidence of intent to take severe retributive action against
 members of the former government or their supporters. In
 response to continued public statements and alleged "plotting"
 in August, the military Government restricted the movement of
 several former ministers, including Jonathan, to their
 immediate home areas.
 Well established procedures remain in effect under the new
 Government for normal civil and criminal cases, including the
 right of a detainee to an early determination as to the
 legality of the detention. However, in political cases, the
 Internal Security (General) Act of 1982 applies. This Act
 provides for preventive detention without charge or trial for
 up to 42 days and for holding detainees incommunicado for part
 of that time. During the second stage of the detention,
 ministerially appointed "advisors"--thus far, such advisers
 have been employees of the Government--report on the health of
 the detainee, investigate whether the detainee has been
 involved in subversive activities, and advise the Minister on
 the need for continued detention. Detainees may make
 representations on their own treatment only through the
 advisors. The Internal Security (General) Act, as amended
 
 
 156
 LESOTHO
 in 1984, disallows bail in cases of arqied robbery and allows
 for detention of witnesses in security cases.
 Knowledgeable observers report that they know of no persons in
 custody as a result of alleged political activities under the
 new regime. A credible government official denies that the
 practice of political detention exists.
 There is no forced labor practiced in Lesotho.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The new military regime did not institute legal proceedings
 against Jonathan or other members of his regime for political
 or other crimes. From time to time senior government
 spokesmen raised the possibility of trials for individual
 politicians of the Jonathan era who may have committed common
 crimes, as opposed to political acts unacceptable to the new
 Government. The only persons incarcerated and subjected to
 either the threat of trial or actual court action were a small
 number of soldiers from the Lesotho Paramilitary Force who, in
 effect, mutinied against the Force command structure just
 prior to the January 20 coup. As noted in l.a., two of those
 persons died mysteriously while in custody. Court martial
 proceedings were reportedly instituted against several others
 in early November.
 The judiciary in Lesotho remains independent under the new
 Government. The courts have acted to limit infringements of
 law and procedure on numerous occasions in past years. Court
 decisions and rulings are respected by the authorities.
 Accused persons have the right to counsel. Under the system
 of Roman-Dutch law applied in Lesotho, there is no trial by
 jury. The judiciary consists of a Court of Appeal, the High
 Court, magistrate courts, and customary or traditional courts
 which exist largely in rural areas to administer customary
 tribal laws.
 The new regime is attempting to increase familiarity with the
 law and its protection of individual rights through the
 established educational system. The King's "Practical Law in
 Lesotho" project, which is backed by the Ministers of Law and
 Education as well as by the judiciary, is intended to
 introduce a layman's course on these subjects into the Lesotho
 high school curriculum.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 These rights are generally respected in Lesotho, although
 under the Internal Security Act the police have wide powers to
 stop and search and to enter homes or other places for a
 similar purpose without a warrant. During the Jonathan
 regime, there were credible allegations of forced entry by
 authorities into the home. There were no such reports in 1986.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Human Rights Act of 1983 provides for freedom of expression
 but subordinates this freedom to the protection of national
 security. Early in 1986, a formal ban on "politics" was
 announced. Although there has been little or no elaboration
 of the limits of that ban, it has been interpreted in practice
 
 
 157
 LESOTHO
 by the public as prohibiting formal political party activity,
 including prohibiting persons from making political speeches
 or publishing or distributing political party materials. Thus
 under the new Government, public freedom of speech in the
 political arena is tightly restricted. In private, however,
 the Basotho tend to openly criticize the Government and the
 political system.
 Opposition viewpoints are expressed freely in two Sesotho-
 language weekly newspapers published by the Roman Catholic
 Church and the Evangelical Church respectively, the only
 privately owned newspapers in the country. During the Jonathan
 regime, this criticism was tolerated but was attacked strongly
 by Lesotho's sole (and government-owned) radio station and also
 by the government-published weekly newspaper, Lesotho Today.
 The former Government also rebutted reporting and editorials
 on Lesotho in the South African media, which is widely followed
 in Lesotho. The new Government has adopted policies which have
 not exposed it to much adverse comment from the South African
 media.
 The new Government still exerts control over the official
 media, (one radio station and a weekly newspaper) but did not
 resort to use of this media in 1986 to attack its critics. In
 fact, apart from a few editorials and comments in the church
 papers, mainly pressing the military Government to continue
 its effort to bring back into the political life of the
 country Ntsu Mokhehle and his Lesotho Liberation Army, there
 has been remarkably little criticism from any quarter. This
 lack of criticism was due in part to the military Government's
 popularity in 1986, in contrast to that of its predecessor.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The military Government's ban on "politics" has not been
 interpreted to require the dissolution of existing political
 parties, but it precludes political meetings and rallies.
 Nonpolitical organizations and professional groups continue to
 exist and hold their regular meetings.
 Numerous individuals within the society meet privately to
 discuss politics and may be working out future strategies for
 their activities as members of political parties when the
 current ban is ultimately lifted. The military Government
 takes a relaxed view of this situation and has made no attempt
 to inhibit such political discussion and advance planning.
 All trade unions in Lesotho enjoy the right to organize,
 bargain collectively, and strike. However, trade unionism has
 played a relatively minor role in society, largely because of
 the small size of the modern manufacturing, retail, and service
 sectors. In 1984 the Government intervened to urge the
 formation of a single trade union confederation after
 negotiations for the merger of the two existing confederations
 broke down. Although some opposition to the new confederation
 lingers, 24 of Lesotho's 28 trade unions participated in the
 Lesotho Congress of Free Trade Unions' (LCFTU) first convention
 in May 1985 and elected the existing leadership to a 3-year
 term. The LCFTU redrafted Lesotho's badly outdated labor laws,
 and agreement to the new draft by the Employers Federation is
 expected in 1987.
 Union, government, and employer representatives have
 participated in delegations to meetings of the International
 Labor Organization and other foreign trade union organizations.
 
 
 158
 LESOTHO
 Lesotho has hosted meetings of the labor arm of the Southern
 African Development Coordination Conference, as well as
 meetings of the International Mineworkers. The LCFTU is a
 member of the democratically oriented International
 Confederation of Free Trade Unions, as well as of the
 Organization of African Trade Union Unity.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 There is no state religion in Lesotho. Free and open religious
 practice is permitted. Christianity is the dominant faith of
 the majority of Basotho, with the principal denomination being
 Roman Catholic. There is a significant Protestant minority as
 well, which is composed of the Lesotho Evangelical Church
 (Presbyterian), the Anglican Church, and a number of other
 smaller denominations. Conversion is permitted, and there is
 no indication that there is any social or political benefit
 attached to belonging to any particular sect.
 A number of church groups praised the new Government's call
 for national reconciliation, and some groups were outspoken in
 asking the Government to redouble its efforts to reintegrate
 Ntsu Mokhehle and his exiled LLA into the country's political
 life. The previous Government was critical of church groups
 and leaders, accusing them of conspiring with opposition
 political factions which supported violence. Occasionally,
 Jonathan's forces harassed prayer meetings calling for
 national reconciliation.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 As one of its first major acts, the new Government declared a
 general amnesty for all Basotho in exile, which was
 specifically aimed at Ntsu Mokhehle, exile leader of the
 Basotho Congress Party (BCP), and his followers. The
 Government maintains that they are free to return without fear
 of retaliation for past activities. However, Mokhehle's
 attitude indicated that he wishes to return only if he can be
 guaranteed a leading, if not the leading, position in the
 existing Government.
 According to the Lesotho Christian Council of Churches, more
 than 500 Basotho who were resident primarily in Botswana and
 South Africa, including BCP/LLA members, have returned to
 Lesotho. Their reception has been positive, despite financial
 difficulties, since the Government has limited funds available
 to assist in the repatriation process.
 Concerning refugees from South Africa, the Government wishes
 to reduce tensions with South Africa and at the same time has
 declared its intent to honor past commitments to receive all
 refugees who cross into Lesotho seeking asylum. Accordingly,
 the Government arranges movement of all refugees into amenable
 third countries, primarily Zambia, Tanzania, and Kenya, as
 soon as possible after they are formally registered as
 refugees. To prevent ANC armed acts against South Africa from
 Lesotho territory, the Government announced in midyear that
 all foreign nationals who enter or who previously had entered
 Lesotho improperly must register as refugees or they would be
 subject to repatriation to the country from which they came.
 By the time this policy was announced, many ANC and other
 activists had already departed Lesotho.

 LESOTHO
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 The military Government which assumed power in January 1986
 announced that it intends to remain in place until the process
 of national reconciliation has been effected. No terminal
 date for this process has been announced, nor has any tentative
 schedule been set for return to civilian rule, elections, or
 constitutional revision. Thus, the Basotho people currently
 do not have the freedom to replace the existing Government,
 but, after 16 years of authoritarian rule by the Jonathan
 regime, the initial popular reception of ths new Government
 was generally positive, especially its goal of national
 reconciliation.
 The Government initiated one political institution-building
 step in 1986 that may ultimately lead to a tiered system of
 indirectly elected representative organs. At the end of the
 year, each village in Lesotho was in the process of
 establishing a Village Development Committee, with members of
 the Committee initially selected by village consensus. The
 objectives of these Village Committees were not clear but
 seemed aimed at determining the line of economic development
 the village should pursue, seeking funds for individual
 development projects, and then implementing them. The
 Government also began preliminary planning for regional and
 ward development committees as the next steps in developing
 political bridges between the villages of the country and the
 national Government. King Moshoeshoe, in a speech to the
 nation December 24, called the committees "town councils" and
 said he viewed them as "the beginning of a road to a national
 a-ssembly of the future."
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The human rights situation in 1986 has drawn no known interest
 on the part of international human rights organizations. There
 is no reason to believe that the new Government would be
 unwilling to discuss human rights issues with outside
 organizations.
 In past years, representatives of Amnesty International have
 visited Lesotho to investigate human rights conditions and
 have been provided access to some security detainees who
 complained of abusive treatment. In general, the Jonathan
 Government attributed alleged human rights violations to an
 excess of zeal or indiscipline by low-level po-lice or military
 officials, stated that such violations were not sanctioned by
 Government policy, and pointed to the judicial remedies
 available in the courts.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 The Basotho nation is one of the rare national entities on the
 African continent without a minority problem. All citizens
 are basically of Basotho stock or have married into the Basotho
 tribal grouping. The expatriate communities are small and not
 considered to be a major factor in the country's political
 life. Exiles from South Africa have from time to time
 encountered some discrimination, since these exiles are often
 viewed as magnets for real or fancied South African political
 or armed intervention.
 
 
 160
 LESOTHO
 All Basotho have fairly equal opportunities, although in the
 areas of property and contracts married women's rights are
 limited by law and custom. For example, a married woman
 cannot apply for a loan without her husband's written consent.
 Women in Lesotho have traditionally been the stabilizing force
 in the home and in the agricultural sector, given the absence
 of over 100,000 Basotho men who work in South Africa. There
 are more female than male children who complete primary and
 secondary schools. Better use of women's talents and abilities
 will depend on their access to credit, changes in land tenure
 laws, and cultural practices. The new Government has not yet
 addressed the issue of women's rights.
 CONDITIONS OF LABOR
 Roughly, 90 percent of the labor force in Lesotho is employed
 in traditional agriculture. The prospect of better paying
 jobs has attracted more than half of Lesotho's male labor
 force to the Republic of South Africa. Most of the migrant
 laborers work in South Africa's gold and coal mines.
 Lesotho's Employment Act of 1967 spells out basic workers'
 rights, including a 45-hour workweek, a weekly rest period of
 at least 24 hours, 12 days' paid leave per year, and pay for
 public holidays. Employers are required to provide adequate
 light, ventilation, and sanitary facilities for employees and
 to install and maintain machinery to minimize the risk of
 injury. Children under 14 years of age are prohibited from
 employment in other than family businesses. Children under 16
 are not allowed to work in excess of 8 hours a day, and
 employers are prohibited from employing any child in hazardous
 conditions. The Government sets minimum wages for various
 types of work. In practice, these regulations are generally
 followed within the wage-scale economy.
