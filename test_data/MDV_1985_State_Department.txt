 MALDIVES
 The Republic of Maldives is a parliamentary democracy headed by
 a strong president. It is best described as an "emerging
 democracy.   There are no political parties, and candidates for
 the unicameral legislature, the Majlis, run for office as
 individuals. The Majlis selects a single nominee for
 president, who is subsequently approved or rejected by the
 voters. All citizens over age 21 may vote.   In practice,
 government control-in this small, homogeneous society is
 exercised by a small elite with a common background and
 outlook, whose authority is generally and traditionally
 accepted by the population.
 The Maldives is a nation of 1,200 islands in 19 atolls
 scattered across an area 500 miles long by 75 miles wide in the
 Indian Ocean. The isolation of individual island communities
 from each other, and of the Republic as a whole from the rest
 of the world, is a dominant feature of social and economic
 life. It is one of the world's least developed countries, with
 nearly-half the population engaged in traditional activities
 such as fishing, harvesting and processing of coconuts, and
 small-scale farming.
 The Maldives has not been subject to attack or invasion from
 outside for hundreds of years, and thus sees no need for a
 large defense establishment. The country's 800-1,000 strong
 National Security Service is responsible for maintaining
 internal law and order, protecting the President, defending the
 country, and preventing foreign fishermen from encroaching on
 Maldivian fishing grounds. The police division of the Service
 investigates crimes, makes arrests, and enforces house arrest.
 There was little change in the human rights situation during
 1985. Virtually universal adherence to Islam, the innate
 conservatism of a traditional society, and the high degree of
 homogeneity of the Maldivian people all underlie the relative
 absence of pressures for social and political change. The
 authority of the small ruling elite is widely accepted and open
 dissent is rare.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There were no reports of political killings in 1985.
 b. Disappearance
 In 1985, there were no reports of disappearances.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 The 1968 Constitution stipulates that "under no condition shall
 a torture considered to be injurious be inflicted upon any
 person." This provision of law is upheld in practice and there
 were no reports or allegations of torture in 1985.
 Maldivians follow Shari'a or Islamic law, and occasionally
 convicted criminals are flogged. Usually, however, punishment
 
 
 1316
 MALDIVES
 is confined to less physical means such as fines, payment of
 compensation, house arrest, imprisonment, or banishment to a
 sparsely populated island where the prisoner must labor to earn
 his daily keep.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The Constitution requires that "no person shall be apprehended
 or arrested, except on a verdict specified by Shari'a or
 (civil) law." There is no provision under Maldivian law for
 preventive detention, and incommunicado detention is not
 practiced. There were no reports in 1985 of persons being
 subjected to arbitrary arrest, detention, or exile. Acting on
 information or complaints received, the Attorney General's
 office passes the case to the appropriate court and the judge
 then instructs the-police to undertake an investigation. The
 suspect is questioned at police headquarters and may, depending
 upon the charges, be detained or placed under house arrest for
 15 days while the case is investigated. If the case is not
 brought to trial within 15 days, the suspect is freed.
 Detention or house arrest may be extended after the first 15
 days by authority of the President, but usually for not more
 than 1 month. While there are no provisions for bail, an
 accused person held without bail who has valid reason to travel
 may receive permission to do so from the court handling his
 case.
 Actions which "arouse the people against the Government" are
 illegal and persons can be arrested and charged with violation
 of this law, the penalty for which can be banishment to remote
 atolls of the Maldives. Forced labor does not exist, except in
 the case of persons banished to remote atolls, who must work to
 earn their keep.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 During trial, the accused may defend himself and call
 witnesses. He also may be assisted by a lawyer, but there are
 few lawyers and lawyers are not provided by the courts. The
 accused is sentenced by the judge; the length and type of
 sentence are established by law and custom.
 There is a High Court and eight lesser courts in the capital at
 Male, each dealing with specific types of cases (e g., debt,
 theft, property claims). On other islands there are courts
 that deal with all types of cases. Judges are trained in
 Islamic law, are appointed by the President and serve at his
 pleasure, and thus cannot be considered fully independent.
 Cases in island courts that present knotty legal points are
 referred to the appropriate specialized court at Male, whose
 judge may in turn refer the legal point to four judges attached
 to the Justice Ministry for assistance. The High Court acts as
 a court of appeal and handles political cases, such as the
 trials of the participants in an attempted coup d'etat in 1980
 and of four Majlis members found guilty of bribery in 1983.
 There are currently only three Maldivians serving sentences of
 banishment for crimes which can be considered political acts.
 These three were convicted either of participation in the 1980
 coup attempt or of unconstitutional activities and taking
 bribes. In November 1985, President Gayoom pardoned about 400
 prisoners who had served a specified portion of their
 sentences. None of the political prisoners were included in
 the pardon, however.

 MALDIVES
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Constitution prohibits the opening, intercepting, reading,
 or making public of letters, telephone conversations,
 telegrams, and wireless messages exchanged between persons
 "except in accordance with the specific provisions of the
 law." There have been no reports of complaints in 1985 that
 the Government monitors correspondence or telephone
 conversations or uses a system of informers. There are no
 prohibitions on the importation of foreign publications, except
 pornography, and foreign broadcasts are not jammed. The
 Government does not interfere with the right to marry, or seek
 forcibly to resettle population.
 The Constitution also requires that private premises and
 dwellings be respected and "therefore they shall not be entered
 into except under conditions and in a manner stipulated in the
 law." There have been no reports of practices to the contrary.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution guarantees freedom of speech and expression
 'so long as the specific provisions of Shari'a and the law are
 not contravened." Any citizen may criticize or complain to the
 Government without fear if he does so through recognized
 channels, such as via letters or oral complaints to the
 President, to a Majlis member, or to a civil servant or other
 person in authority.
 Maldivians are frequently frank in private when discussing and
 criticizing the Government. However, the law which prohibits
 arousing opposition to the legally established Government,
 together with a long tradition of authoritarian rule, tend to
 make Maldivians careful when expressing their opinions to
 foreigners or in the media. There is no prior censorship of
 newspapers, but writers and editors are subject to prosecution
 if their articles contravene the law. In 1984, five writers
 were prosecuted for articles which the Government alleged had
 created antigovernment feelings. Of the five, one was
 banished. The offensive articles dealt with such matters as
 suggestions for improving the fisheries sector and how to deal
 with foreign vessel encroachments, inefficiency in a government
 hospital, and a discussion of the laws preventing the
 Government from closing, as it intended, a private radio
 station. A few editors and writers were questioned about
 articles for which they were responsible during 1985, but none
 was prosecuted.
 There are three privately owned newspapers, each required to
 register with the Government. The only government-owned
 publication is the News Bulletin, published by the Maldivian
 Department of Information and Broadcasting.
 The Government does not restrict academic freedom. Maldivians
 are free to acquire and impart knowledge "in a manner that does
 not contravene Shari'a or civil law." A law in effect since
 July 1984 has required that students enrolled in government-run
 or government-assisted schools be liable for government service
 for varying periods, depending upon their educational
 attainments. The bill was deemed necessary because of the drop
 in the number of young Maldivians entering government service.

 MALDIVES
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Constitution assures freedom of assembly and association,
 but Maldivians make little use of these freedoms in a political
 sense. The majority of rallies and meetings are sponsored or
 approved by the Government and commonly are addressed by
 officials or religious leaders. Clubs and other private
 associations, of which there are many, are permitted to
 function if they do not contravene Shari'a and civil law, and
 if they register with the Government.
 There are no trade unions in the Maldives. Workers' rights to
 organize, bargain collectively, and strike are not recognized
 or protected by statute. Until the 1970's, most Maldivians
 either were self-employed or held government jobs and there was
 a relative lack of interest in workers' rights or
 organization. However, during the past 4 years three sizable
 garment manufacturing facilities opened, employing large
 numbers of workers. There were no special provisions regarding
 workers' rights or treatment in the agreements to establish
 these companies between the Government and the foreign
 investors. However, a Department of Labour was formed in 1982
 and it has been studying the labor situation in the Maldives
 and in other countries with a view eventually to developing
 appropriate labor regulations for the Maldives.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 The Constitution makes Islam the official religion and all
 citizens are Muslims. There are no churches or shrines for the
 practice of any other religion. Missionaries of non-Muslim
 faiths are not permitted to proselytize in the Maldives.
 Conversion of a Muslim to any other faith would be a violation
 of the Shari'a, the law of the land, and would automatically
 result in the loss of Maldivian citizenship. However, links
 with coreligionists in other countries are freely allowed and a
 delegation from the Maldives performs the Hajj each year.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Maldivians are free to move about the country unless they are
 under house arrest or detention or banished. However, the
 Government discourages Maldivians from changing islands of
 residence, primarily because most recent migrants have moved to
 Male, which is becoming severely overcrowded. The Government
 reimposed regulations in 1982 that limit immigration to the
 capital island and its surrounding atoll, permitting migration
 to Male only for short periods in order to work, be educated,
 or receive medical treatment. At the same time, the Government
 has made a major effort to improve social and educational
 services and develop industry outside of Male.
 Maldivians are free to change jobs. There are no restrictions
 on foreign travel or on emigration, and there are no exit
 visas. The Government requires any Maldivian who has acquired
 another nationality to maintain Maldivian nationality
 concurrently. Such a person must enter and leave the Maldives
 on a Maldivian passport. As far as is known, the Government
 never has revoked the citizenship of any Maldivian. There are
 no refugees or displaced persons and, so far as is known, no
 Maldivians have been exiled or are refugees or displaced
 persons elsewhere.

 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 President Maumoon Abdul Gayoom rules the Maldives together with
 a small group of generally well-educaied members of the elite
 who are loyal to him. There are no political parties, although
 they are not forbidden by law. President Gayoom has, however,
 publicly discouraged their formation as being inappropriate to
 the homogeneous nature of Maldivian society.
 Members of the unicameral legislature, the Majlis, are chosen
 for 5-year terms by means of secret ballots cast by all
 Maldivians over 21 years of age. Candidates for the Majlis
 must be over 25 years of age, Muslim, able to read and write
 both Arabic and Maldivian script, not involved in a crime for
 the past 5 years, and in good mental and physical condition.
 Of 48 members, 40 are elected (2 from each atoll and 2 from
 Male), and 8 are appointed by the President. There were 162
 candidates for the 40 seats contested in the December 1984
 elections. Once elected, Majlis representatives are freely
 approached by citizens or groups with grievances or points of
 view on proposed legislation.
 Candidates for President must be Sunni Muslim, born of
 Maldivian parents, male, over 30 years old, not convicted of
 any crimes, and mentally stable. A single nominee for
 President is chosen by secret ballot in the Majlis from as many
 candidates as are proposed by the members. The nomination then
 is confirmed or rejected in a nationwide referendum, also by
 secret ballot. In 1983, the Majlis voted 47 to I to nominate
 Gayoom to a second, 5-year term. Maldivians confirmed Gayoom
 with 95.62 percent of their votes. At the time of his
 nomination and the referendum, President Gayoom had no serious
 competitor for the position. Some irregularities apparently
 occurred during the referendum, especially on outer atolls
 where island chiefs cast the ballots of all eligible voters on
 their islands. Nevertheless, it is fair to assume that
 Gayoom's leadership is widely accepted by the electorate.
 Since there are no political parties, factions in the Majlis
 tend to coalesce around individuals or points of view and vary
 according to the issue. Any member may introduce legislation,
 which, if seconded, must be considered by the Majlis. All laws
 must be approved by the Majlis. The Majlis has the power to
 question ministers and to call for their removal. In practice,
 however, the Majlis generally supports the Government after
 carefully discussing and sometimes amending its proposals.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 There were no requests for outside investigation of human
 rights violations in 1985. There are no local human rights
 organizations. Amnesty International did not include the
 Maldives in its 1985 Report. Freedom House rated the Maldives
 "partly free."
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 The population of the Maldives is 180,000 and is growing at an
 annual rate of 3.6 percent. Estimated gross domestic product
 per capita rose to $460 in 1985. Just under a quarter of the
 
 
 1320
 MALDIVES
 population lives on Male, the capital island, which is 400
 miles west-southwest of Sri Lanka.
 The economy performed well in 1985, due largely to growth in
 the fishing and tourism industries, but the Maldives
 nevertheless remains one the least developed countries in the
 world. Most Maldivians still work in traditional occupations:
 fishing, the largest industry, involving about 46 percent of
 the population; harvesting coconuts for copra and making rope;
 and some subsistence farming. The tourist and textile
 industries are providing much-needed additional foreign
 exchange.
 The Government is trying to improve the standard of living,
 partly by working to increase production of traditional
 products such as fish and coconuts. It also is trying to tempt
 the inhabitants of Male to return to their native islands or
 atolls with prospects of employment and better social services
 there. Programs are under way to replace coconut trees with
 better strains, make better use of the limited arable land
 (only 10 percent of the total land), and to introduce new
 varieties of vegetables in family gardens. There are efforts
 to increase the annual catch of fish through improved
 technology.
 The tourist industry has continued its rapid expansion. Until
 several years ago, the Government permitted development of
 tourist resorts only on islands not inhabited by Maldivians and
 around Male, where most educated Maldivians live, in part to
 lessen the impact of tourism on the conservative society of the
 Maldives. In 1985 there were over 50 hotels and guest houses
 operating on designated resort islands throughout the country
 to accommodate the over 100,000 tourist arrivals. The tourist
 "bed night index" has more than doubled since 1980. The
 tourism industry received a special boost in 1985 with the
 establishment of direct scheduled flights from Male to Europe
 and Singapore.
 By 1985, the Government had reached its goal of establishing 22
 health centers in the 19 atolls. Plans exist to upgrade and
 improve three of these health centers. Besides the fairly well
 equipped hospital in one of the northern atolls, in 1985 a new
 hospital was completed and opened in a Southern atoll and
 construction began on another. Health care remains rudimentary
 but is improving. Life expectancy at birth is 53.3 years and
 infant mortality is 81.5 per 1,000 live births. Based on 1980
 statistics, only 5 percent of the total population of the
 Maldives has access to safe water, with urban dwellers (11
 percent) better off than rural residents (3 percent).
 The present Government has made considerable progress in
 education. The country boasts about 85 college graduates, and
 56 percent of Maldivians had completed primary school in 1985,
 up from 44 percent the previous year. Primary school
 enrollment is 12.2 percent. On the basis of 1977 statistics,
 the overall literacy rate is 82.4 percent, with the rate for
 women (82,3) slightly lower than that for men (82.5).
 There is now a government school, with trained teachers and a
 broad curriculum, in every atoll. At present, these schools
 serve only the children on the islands where they are located.
 The Government's long-term goal is to have such schools on
 every inhabited island. The Government has also built
 community education centers in every atoll. It has established
 
 
 1321
 MALDIVES
 an advanced level secondary school and a vocational training
 center on Male island, and it plans to build vocational
 training centers in some of the outer atolls. A teachers
 training center opened in Male in March 1984, but there are no
 universities in the Maldives. As a result, the Government
 seeks scholarships for promising students to attend
 universities in the Middle East, India, Australia, and the
 United Kingdom.
 Worker rights are neither recognized nor protected in the
 Maldives, and there are very few labor standards set by the
 Government. Only government workers are entitled by
 presidential directive to a paid annual holiday and free health
 care in the event of work-caused illness. There is no minimum
 age for the employment of young people. The Government has set
 no restrictions on conditions under which children or young
 people may be employed, although most employers do not hire
 young people for work at night or in what are considered
 hazardous conditions. There is no national minimum wage,
 although the Government has established wage floors for certain
 kinds of work. There is no restriction on the number of hours
 per week an employee can be required to work, and there is no
 requirement that private sector employees receive an annual
 paid holiday.
 A textile factory on Thulusdhoo in Male Atoll, which opened in
 1985, has been plagued by allegations of worker abuse and
 violations of the terms of employment contracts. Most of the
 workers are Sri Lankan women. The Maldivian Government has
 begun investigating these claims.
 Traditionally not equal beneficiaries of the political and
 economic opportunities of their country, Maldivian women have
 benefited from the current Government's deliberate efforts to
 improve opportunities for them. Patterns of behavior and
 living conditions for women are less restrictive than in some
 other Islamic countries. For example, they are not required to
 wear the veil, and a growing number of women serve in
 responsible positions in the Government and in the professions.
 By Islamic and Maldivian tradition, women play a lesser role
 than men in public life. No women were serving as members of
 the Majlis elected in 1980; President Gayoom appointed one.
 There are three women in the Citizens' Special Majlis that is
 reviewing the proposed constitution. Women hold 15 responsible
 positions in the civil service. The President has appointed 2
 women as aides, another to be his Director of Social Affairs,
 and 2 women to his 12-member Consultative Committee. In 1982,
 the President appointed a National Women's Committee which is
 seeking ways to increase participation by women in the
 country's life.
