 ICELAND
 Iceland is a democratic social welfare state. It
 has the oldest elected parliament in the world, the
 Althing, which first met in 930. Democratic
 traditions and ideals are deeply rooted and there is
 broad legal and social support for human rights.
 Elections to the Althing are held at least every
 four years, and the president of the republic is
 popularly elected every four years as well.
 In the presidential election of 1980, Iceland
 elected the first female chief of state ever chosen
 by popular election anywhere in the world. Many
 factors contributed to this result, including the
 conviction of some people that the choice of a woman
 was a statement of belief in the equality of women
 and their ability to participate fully in the
 nation's public affairs.
 Iceland is a signatory of both the International
 Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the
 International Covenant on Economic, Social and
 Cultural Rights.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person,
 Including Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 Freedom from torture is guaranteed in Iceland law
 (Chapter 14, Article 225) and respected in
 practice. There have been no allegations of torture
 in Iceland.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Physical punishment is not practiced. Prisons and
 jails are modern and clean; health care and diet are
 excellent. All prisoners are treated the same
 except that those convicted of serious crimes are
 subjected to somewhat stricter security
 precautions. There is no discrimination by social
 class, race, sex or religion. There are no problems
 regarding visits by family or attorney. There have
 been no executions in Iceland in modern history.
 c. Disappearances
 There have been no allegations of people
 disappearing because of official or quasi-official
 actions. Secret arrest, clandestine detention and
 quasi-official security forces are unknown in
 Iceland.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest ard Imprisonment
 Freedom from arbitrary arrest or imprisonment is
 guaranteed by law and respected in practice. There
 is a form of habeas corpus; anyone detained must be
 brought before a judge within 24 hours and charged
 or released. There is no preventive detention, and
 there are no political prisoners.

 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The right of a fair public trial is guaranteed by
 law. The courts are under the Minister of Justice
 for administrative purposes but are independent of
 political control, and there are no military or
 other special courts. Defendants are entitled to
 legal counsel, and the state will pay the fees if
 the defendant cannot. Defendants may appeal to the
 Supreme Court. In practice this often results in
 sentdnces being modified in the defendant's favor.
 f. Invasion of the Home
 Freedom from invasion of the home is guaranteed by
 law and respected in practice. Judicial warrants
 are required to conduct a search except in cases of
 hot pursuit. There have been no allegations of
 illegal entry or other violations of the home.
 2. Government    Policies Relating to the Fulfillment
 of Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health
 Care and Education
 National policy stresses full employment and
 provision of decent social services, education and
 housing. Education through the university level is
 free. There are extensive programs to encourage
 private ownership of homes and to provide a
 comprehensive system of medical and dental care, as
 well as necessary social services, for the entire
 population. A social welfare state on the
 Scandinavian pattern, Iceland has comprehensive
 programs of old age and disability pensions,
 unemployment compensation, sickness insurance, and
 child and family care.
 Economic, health and social standards are among the
 best in the world. There is virtually no poverty,
 illiteracy or unemployment.
 Women enjoy full equality before the law, in social
 and political rights, and in employment. Although
 many Icelandic women remain in the traditional roles
 common to Western Europe, there are no legal
 constraints.
 3. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties,
 Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and
 Assembly
 These freedoms are guaranteed by law and are in
 effect. Printed materials are not censored except
 for some hard-core pornography. Films are normally
 distributed without restriction, but scenes of
 extreme violence and sexual perversion may be
 deleted.
 The government makes no attempt to restrict
 journalistic or academic inquiry. With the help of
 financial backing from political parties, Iceland
 
 
 818
 has a large number of newspapers for its small
 population. These are entirely free of government
 control, and, in fact, are subsidized equally by the
 government, which is required by law to place its
 advertisements in all of Reykjavik's six daily
 papers. Limits on criticism of the government and
 the political parties by the press are unknown,
 although radio and television broadcasting are
 state-owned and operated. Radio and television
 journalists are supposed to be non-partisan and to
 maintain standards of professional ethics. They are
 supervised by public boards representing the four
 major political parties as well as other interests.
 There are no restrictions on public meeting except
 fer general regulations on public safety for outdoor
 meetings; unions, scientific bodies, and
 professional associations operate freely.
 The Lutheran church is established in the
 constitution as the official church. Lutheranism is
 the nominal faith of the vast majority ot
 Icelanders. Other faiths practice freely and
 without restriction. Religion is not a factor in
 civil, economic, or political status.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country,
 Foreign Travel, Emigration and Repatriation
 There is freedom of movement, foreign travel, and
 emigration. The only practical obstacle to foreign
 travel is a limit on the amount of money travelers
 may take abroad. Many people find this an
 inconvenience but it does not seriously impede
 either business or vacation travel.
 There are no restrictions on voluntary
 repatriation. There are no refugees from Iceland,
 and forcible repatriation is unknown. Icelanders
 may emigrate freely, with no discrimination or
 harassment. There is no discrimination against
 women or other groups in such matters.
 In modern history Iceland has received two groups of
 refugees. Following the Hungarian revolt of 1956,
 fifty Hungarian refugees settled in Iceland. A few
 of these eventually moved on for their own reasons,
 but the majority stayed and are completely
 integrated into Icelandic society. In 1979 Iceland
 accepted thirty-four Vietnamese refugees. They were
 received and settled with great care, including
 comprehensive health care, vocational and language
 training, and public housing. Many of the
 Vietnamese are now working and attending school.
 Iceland has undertaken to accept twenty additional
 Vietnamese refugees, mainly relatives of those in
 the first group.
 Iceland is a signatory of the Geneva Convention on
 Refugees. The first political asylum case in
 Icelandic history occurred in 1980 and was handled
 in accord with the convention. Until his departure,
 the Soviet national concerned was granted temporary
 permission to remain in Iceland. A French national,
 
 
 819
 who had deserted from the French Army, sought refuge
 in Iceland. However, Icelandic authorities
 determined that his was not a political asylum case,
 and he subsequently left the country.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political
 Process
 Civil and political liberties in Iceland are fully
 respected. The labor movement, a dominant social
 and political force within the country, acts to
 protect the rights of all workers, a policy backed
 by advanced and comprehensive legislation on public
 welfare. Democratic processes exist at all levels,
 assuring the freedom to participate in the political
 process. Women are legally equal to men. They may
 participate freely in social, economic and political
 life although fewer women than men are active in
 politics. They comprise approximately 30 per cent
 of the work force and are active in every aspect of
 Icelandic political, economic, and cultural life.
 The president of Iceland is a woman.
 Political, professional, economic and public
 interest groups of all kinds exist and are
 encouraged by the government. Many of these
 advocate issues or philosophies which may be in
 opposition to a particular government or political
 party. There are a few extremist groups on the
 political fringes. They are small, non-violent, and
 tolerated by the public and the government.
 There are no significant problems regarding
 nationality, citizenship, or statelessness.
 4. Government Attitude and Record Regarding
 International and Non-governmental
 Investigation of Alleged Violations of Human
 Rights
 No requests have been made for outside investigation
 of the human rights situation in Iceland.*
 There are several human rights organizations active
 in Iceland, including Amnesty International, and
 groups monitoring compliance with the Helsinki Final
 Act and dissident activities in the Soviet Union and
 Eastern Europe. These groups focus almost all their
 attention and resources on problems in foreign
 countries. There is also some effort to improve
 further the participation by disadvantaged groups,
 such as the mentally and physically handicapped, in
 Iceland's social welfare programs. There are also
 feminist organizations which work for women's rights
 and particularly for greater participation by women
 in the political process and economic and social
 organizations. These groups are encouraged and
 supported by the government and the political
 parties.
