 conditions. There were also brief work slowdowns by teachers
 and airport baggage handlers about late payment of salaries.
 The increasing scarcity of jobs is also a real restraint on
 labor complaints, organizational activities, and formal
 strikes. The Government's inability to pay wages and salaries
 on schedule sometimes results in work slowdowns, absenteeism,
 and informal, peaceful protests.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 The absence of formal unions does not mean that collective
 bargaining does not exist. There are various informal
 collective conventions between workers and employers. There
 are no export processing zones. Labor legislation, to the
 extent it exists, is applied uniformly throughout the country.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 There is no forced or compulsory labor in the Comoros.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 The minimum age for employment of children is 15. This is
 generally respected. Child labor is not an issue due to the
 lack of employment opportunities for adolescents and young
 adults. Children do help in family units in the large
 subsistence sector.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 The currently accepted, minimum wage is approximately $50 per
 month, which is barely adequate to cover basic human needs.
 However, the hours of work in any category rarely exceed 35
 hours per week. In 1989 the Government reminded employers to
 respect the Labor Code, which guarantees a day off per week
 plus a month of paid vacation per year. Otherwise, the
 Government's role in such labor-related fields as setting
 health and safety standards is miminal.

 The People's Republic of the Congo is officially a
 Marxist-Leninist state governed by an elite group of civilian
 and military officials through the single legal party, the
 Congolese Labor-Party (PCT). President penis Sassou-Nguesso,
 Chief of State and Head of Government since 1979, serves as
 President of the 75-member PCT Central Committee. The
 President nominates the other 12 members of the PCT Political
 Bureau, the key policymaking group, whose selection is
 approved by the Central Committee. Under Sassou, Central
 Committee membership has usually reflected a balance among
 Congo's rival southern, northern, and central ethnic groups.
 The military and security services are firmly under the
 control of the northerners, who are the ultimate arbiters of
 power in Congo and have dominated its Government since 1968.
 The need to maintain a consensus among the competing regions
 and ethnic groups has provided a check on arbitrary and overly
 pronbrthern policies. Congo's National Assembly has limited
 powers, but it has recently begun to serve as a sounding board
 on ,Social and economic issues and to draw representatives of
 key interest groups outside the PCT into the political arena.
 The security' apparatus, which is under the direction of the
 Presidency, is headed by the State Security Organization   -
 (DGSE) and is patterned after those in Eastern Europe. Its
 principal objectiveis to protect the State against all
 possible dissident actiirity. As of late 1989, the military
 forces were no longer routinely used for internal security
 purposes because the police have been reorganized, removed
 from the Ministry of Defense, and given special riot and crowd
 control tfaining. PCT "core groups" are in all ministries,
 labor organizations, mass organizations, and urban districts.
 They only intermittently attain their stated goal of
 monitoring the activities of workers and neighbors.
 The Congolese economy is highly dependent on oil, and
 decliiiing oil prices since 1985 have'forced the Government to
 cut its budget expenditures, cooperate with the International
 Monetary Fund'ind World Bank in formulating a.structural
 adjustment program, and to'seek debt relief measures. In
 addition, since 1985 the Government has followed a policy of
 liberalization of the economy and has moved toward a truly
 nonaligned foreign policy. At the Fourth PCT Congress in July
 1989, the party called for and adopted an economic program
 emphasizing administrative reform, agricultural
 self-sufficiency, privptization of state enterprises, and
 encouragement bf foreign investment. Despite-its Socialist
 policies, the PCT has never-forbidden private property and
 enterprise, and it has encouraged the indigenous commercial
 sector in the past.few years.
 Human righth remained circumscribed in 1989. Most Congolese
 live their lives with little government interference as long
 as they do not criticize the Government. The principal human
 rights problems include mistreatment and torture of detainees;
 arbitrar" detentions; lack of fair trial; discrimination
 against womei; and tight restrictions on freedom of speech and
 press, assembly and association, worker rights, and the right
 of citizens to change their government.

 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for and Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 There were no reports of such killings.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reported cases of disappearance for political
 motives.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment.
 The practice of beating suspects at police stations and at
 state security centers in the course of interrogations is
 common. The public or the police frequently beat thieves who
 have been caught in the act of stealing. Political detainees
 are held incommunicado; Ammnesty International (AI), in
 various statements and reports, has expressed concern about
 the use of torture to extract information from detainees held
 after the 1987 coup attempt. At the same time, several
 political prisoners held incommunicado in the past are now
 leading normal lives, including as government ministers.
 Prison conditions in general are very poor.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The Constitution provides protection against arbitrary
 indictment, arrest, and detention. But in practice a warrant
 is not required to make arrests. Under the Code of Penal
 Procedure a detainee must be brought before an investigative
 judge within 3 days of arrest. The judge may then order
 detention for a maximum period of 6 months, after which the
 detainee must be charged or released. This law, however, does
 not apply in cases involving security of the State, and
 political detainees have been held for lengthy periods without
 being brought before a judge or charged, e.g., the Government
 held Georges Mfaouta-Kitoko, Christophe Samba, and Florent
 Kihoulou without charge from 1986 to 1988 for belonging to an
 independent political discussion group and writing a tract
 calling for a "new society." The trial of those accused of
 participation in the 1982 Brazzaville bombings did not take
 place until 1986, and some of the accused were held
 incommunicado for several years. A similar pattern appears
 with respect to those accused in the 1987 coup attempt.
 Despite government steps to increase the number of magistrates
 and improve procedures, the administrative processing of
 regular criminal cases is slow, and persons awaiting trial are
 often held for lengthy periods: Whether a detainee is
 formally charged usually depends upon the seriousness of the
 crime and the economic situation of the family. For lesser
 crimes, the person is usually taken to jail, where he may be
 beaten and held for a few days, then released on bail pending
 a trial which may never take place. A person accused of a
 serious crime (e.g., murder, rape) is held in prison until the
 trial, which may be held months or even years later.
 The number of political detainees or prisoners in 1989 was
 unavailable. In 1987, according.to Al, the Government
 arrested 60 or 70 people in connection with an abortive coup
