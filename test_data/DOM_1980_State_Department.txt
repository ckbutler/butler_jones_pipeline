 DOMINICAN REPUBLIC
 The Dominican Republic is a constitutional democracy
 with an elected president and vice president, an elected
 bicameral legislature, and a judicial branch headed
 by a Supreme Court whose members are appointed by the
 Senate. President Antonio Guzman Fernandez is now
 in the third year of a four-year term which commenced
 in August 1978. His administration has been successful
 in promoting substantially broader political and civil
 rights, but less so in improving the economic and physical
 well-being of the populace.
 The Dominican Republic has gone through periods of
 harsh tyranny with only occasional interludes of political
 freedom since gaining independence from Haiti in 1844.
 Although the founders of the Dominican Republic set
 high standards for democratic practice and respect
 for individual liberties, these values were systematically
 violated by many of their successors, particularly
 during the dictatorship of Rafael Trujillo (1930-1961).
 After Trujillo's assassination in 1961, successive
 governments began to respect basic human rights and
 the traditions of democracy gained in strength. The
 peaceful transfer of power in 1978, the first to occur
 from one civilian party to another in this century,
 was a landmark in this process of democratization.
 Dominicans now enjoy in practice the broad range of
 human rights guaranteed in the 1966 constitution.
 However, steady improvement in the economic well-being
 of the Dominican people has been frustrated by a number
 of factors--including the increasingly high cost of
 fuel in a country which possesses few energy resources,
 the estimated 800 million dollars in damage dealt in
 September 1979 by hurricanes David and Frederick, and
 the urgent need to improve agricultural production
 and modernize the facilities of aging state enterprises
 in the face of exceedingly scarce financial resources.
 The Dominican Republic has a population of approximately
 5,500,000 that increased over the past decade at the
 rate of some 2.5 percent annually. One-half of the
 population is under 16 years of age, and unemployment,
 historically high, has increased since the hurricanes.
 Most Dominicans have little formal education and the
 literacy is estimated by the government to be around
 62 percent. The last two decades have seen the emergence
 of a middle class and per capita income is just under
 $1,000, However, income distribution is highly skewed.
 Over 500,000 Dominicans live outside of their country--mostly
 ih the United States--mainly in order to improve their
 economic opportunities.
 1.   Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a.   Torture
 Title II, Section I, Article 8 of the Dominican constitution
 of 1966 specifically prohibits torture and it is not
 practiced.
 b.   Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 
 
 413
 Such treatment is prohibited by the constitution.
 The Guzman administration entered office with a commitment
 to improve a poor prison system but, mainly because
 of financial constraints, much remains to be done
 to correct unsanitary and overcrowded conditions.
 The access of prisoners and their families to the
 press remains a major deterrent to cruel, inhuman
 or degrading punishment. Still, periodic reports
 of maltreatment of prisoners appear in the press and
 prisoners frequently claim, with some plausibility,
 that they were physically mistreated by the police.
 Dominican police at times use prolonged interrogation
 techniques that could constitute cruel treatment and
 prisoners in investigative custody have been held
 incommunicado for up to five days--despite the stipulation
 in the Dominican constitution that a prisoner may
 be held for no longer than forty-eight hours before
 being charged.
 In January 1980, the prosecutor of the National District
 announced an investigation into the mistreatment
 of prisoners and, in July, the prosecutor of the Montecristi
 District charged and arrested four police officials
 for "unmercifully" beiting prisoners. In February
 1980 the Attorney general declared that a "revolution"
 in prison conditions was needed and called on the
 deputy chief of the national police to investigate
 various abuses, presumably referring to the beating
 of prisoners. In a few instances, policemen and soldiers
 have been tried, convicted and sentenced for abusing
 prisoners ind for killing suspects falsely alleged
 to have been fleeing from or resisting arrest.
 c.   Disappearances
 There are no reports of disappearances.
 d.   Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 Administration officials have publicly called for
 improvement in the judicial system and increased protection
 of human rights. The government passed amnesty legislation
 in its first year in office that resulted in the release
 of over 200 political prisoners and the return of
 many exiles. There are no allegations that any political
 prisoners remain in Dominican jails, although Amnesty
 International, in its 1979 report, does refer to Castulo
 Toussaint, a leftist activist, as an "alleged" political
 prisoner. Toussaint is serving a 20-year sentence
 for murder.
 The Guzman administration has not generally engaged
 in politically-motivated arrests. Two exceptions
 were leftist labor leaders involved in a violent mid-
 1980 strike and several radical leftist proponents
 of Puerto Rican independence rounded up before the
 state visit of Puerto Rican Governor Carlos Romero
 Barcelo. They were released within the constitutionally
 mandated 48-hour period. However, the 48-hour period
 is not always observed. Persons involved in a recent
 case of attempted aircraft hijacking were held incommunicado
 for periods of time considerably longer than 48 hours
 and an American citizen involved in the incident repeatedly
 was denied immediate access to a consular officer.
 Lack of prompt consular access also has occurred in
 other cases.
 
 
 414
 e.   Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Laws calling for fair public trials are respected,
 and court-appointed lawyers are provided free of charge
 for the indigent. The defendant is typically charged
 shortly after arrest and the charges are clearly stated
 and made available to the defending counsel. The
 judicial branch is independent of the executive branch.
 No special political or security courts exist and
 civilians may not be tried by a military court; nor
 members of the armed forces by civilian courts. An
 appeals procedure, including appeals courts and a
 supreme court, is extensively utilized.
 f.   Invasion of the Home
 A residence may not be searched without due process,
 which typically consists of a search made in the presence
 of a prosecutor or an assistant prosecutor, except
 in cases of "hot pursuit" or a sound presumption that
 a crime is actually occurring within the residence.
 constitutional safeguards against invasion of the
 home are generally observed.
 2.   Government Policies Relating to the Fulfillment
 of Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health
 Care and Education
 The Guzman administration has allocated a higher proportion
 of public resources than previous governments have
 to economic and social development programs designed
 to meet the basic needs of the poor. Life expectancy
 is on the rise and infant mortality rates have been
 dropping steadily over the past several years. Preventive
 medicine has been given priority status with special
 attention to extending basic health services to the
 entire rural population. However, the devastation
 caused by two severe hurricanes has greatly impaired
 progress in rural development, and the government
 must rely upon massive international assistance to
 complete its recovery and reconstruction program.
 Patterns of income and land ownership remain widely
 skewed, but the government has attempted to improve
 the situation by means of a land reform program reinforced
 by a 1972 law that calls for redistribution of a portion
 of landholdings benefiting from publicly-financed
 irrigation projects. Meanwhile, the government is
 actively promoting cooperatives and farmer associations
 and its agricultural extension service has reportedly
 become increasingly responsive and client-oriented.
 The government has also raised the urban minimum monthly
 wage to 125 pesos (one peso equals one dollar at the
 official rate) and increased public salaries. Rural
 minimum wage is less than the urban minimum wage.
 Despite these efforts, poverty is still endemic, with
 24 to 26 percent of the population unemployed and
 another 38 to 40 percent underemployed. Both the
 World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank
 are in general agreement that approximately 45 percent
 of the population --including the majority of the
 rural population--live below the Latin American poverty
 line. Per capita calorie consumption remains under
 minimum requirements and malnutrition is a problem
 in certain sectors of the population.
 The government has demonstrated a strong com itment
 
 
 415
 to improve the economic status of the Dominican people,
 but many of its efforts in this regard have been frustrated
 by natural disasters, managerial deficiencies, and
 a chronic lack of financial resources. Even though
 the prices of the country's major exports, sugar and
 gold, are relatively high, the increase in export
 earnings from these items has been offset by the increased
 cost (now absorbing about 60 percent of export earnings)
 of the totally-imported petroleum supply.
 In the area of education, the government has increased
 funding and raised teachers' salaries. The number
 of students in school has increased, but many children
 still do not attend primary school and only a fraction
 of eligible students have access to secondary education.
 According to Dominican law, the government is responsible
 for providing free primary education to all Dominicans
 between 7 and 14 years of age. The educational infra-
 structure, particularly in rural areas, could not
 cope with the demand if this law were enforced.
 Housing conditions remain substandard in most areas
 of the country. They are particularly poor in congested
 urban centers and in certain traditionally depressed
 rural areas. Housing problems were aggravated by
 the hurricanes and several hundred displaced persons
 are still living in temporary shelters and in public
 buildings.
 3.   Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a.   Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 These liberties are guaranteed by law and are largely
 respected. Dominican newspapers engage heavily in
 political commentary and are rated by the International
 Press Association as among the freest in the hemisphere.
 Seven daily newspapers flourish in Santo Domingo and
 are distributed throughout the country. The government
 has been charged with intervening to a limited extent
 in radio and television broadcasting by offering or
 withholding advertising rdVenues, but the country's
 numerous privately-owned radio (149 AM stations, 61
 PM stations) and five television stations air almost
 all political points of view, as.does the government-
 owned radio and television network.
 There have been repeated instances in which returning
 travelers have had Marxist-oriented literature taken
 from them upon entering the Dominican Republic; shipments
 of leftist literature also have been confiscated by
 customs. In July 1980, thousands of leftist works
 were returned to their owners through the Office of
 the Prosecutor, but allegations continue that customs
 authorities on occasion confiscate such materials.
 While outdoor public meetings require a government
 permit, indoor gatherings or political parties, labor
 unions, and other associations are unrestricted.
 At times, permits for outdoor demonstrations have
 not been granted to extreme leftist groups and these
 demonstrations have been dispersed.  There have been
 allegations of interference by partisans of the government
 party in meetings of opposition groups, but such activity
 is more in the line of traditional heckling and does
 not appear to be part of any officially-organized
 
 
 416
 campaign.
 Labor unions have not historically played a significant
 role in the Dominican Republic and only 12 percent
 of the labor force is organized. However, many active
 labor unions flourish even though they operate under
 the handicap of a labor law written during the Trujillo
 dictatorship that gives unions very few rights vis-
 a-vis management. A new code has been introduced
 in congress, but it appears unlikely that a revised
 labor law will be promulgated in the near *future.
 In the meantime, the secretary of labor has permitted
 unions to exercise their rights under the existing
 law more fully than in the past and has not given
 undue favoritism to the confederation affiliated with
 the government party. The right to strike is not
 curtailed.
 Approximately 9S percent of the population is Roman
 Catholic and the Church's preeminent position is recognized
 by the Concordat between the Dominican Republic and
 the Holy See and by the populace at large. Discrimination
 on racial, religious or ethnic grounds is prohibited
 by the constitution and there are no restrictions
 on the practice of other religious faiths.
 b.   Freedom of Movement Within the Country,
 Foreign Travel, Emigration and Repatriation
 There is no restriction on-travel within the country,
 but travel outside the country can be legally prevented
 on various grounds, such as outstanding tax claims,
 or civil and criminal suits. A law requiring prior
 government approval for travel to communist countries
 was repealed in 1979 because it was viewed as contradicting
 the Dominican constitution. Many political exiles
 returned to the country after the 1978 amnesty, but
 there still exists a legal ban on the return of certain
 members of the Trujillo family and several other persons.
 The status and treatment of Haitians living in the
 Dominican Republic has been the focus of increasingly
 critical press and public attention both in the Dominican
 Republic and abroad. Haitians constitute the largest
 minority, with estimates of Haitians permanently and,
 in most cases, illegally residing in the Dominican
 Republic ranging between 200,000 and 500,000. Although
 there is no evidence of any systematic effort to dis-
 criminate against legal Haitian residents, the long
 and complex relationship between the two countries
 has produced some stereotyped fears and prejudices
 regarding Haiti and Haitians.
 Recent criticism of government policy regarding the
 Haitian community has been centered on the government-
 to-government agreement for recruitment and admission
 of 12,00-16,000 Haitian cane cutters (braceros) each
 year for the six-month December-May sugar harvest.
 The terms of this agreement, which have not been publicly
 disclosed, cover only a small portion of the estimated
 80,000 Haitian migrant workers who cross into the
 Dominican Republic during the sugar harvest season.
 Most earn less than four dollars a day on a piece
 work basis. A number of incidents involving the brutal
 treatment of braceros by guards and soldiers have
 been reported by the local press.
 
 
 417
 Most Haitians permanently residing in the country
 are undocumented and are thereby subject to the same
 kinds of exploitation that illegal aliens suffer in
 other countries. Although most of the Haitians living
 in the Dominican Republic are there for economic reasons,
 there are also a number of Haitian political exiles
 and several exile organizations. The Dominican constitution
 prohibits foreigners from engaging in any political
 activity in the Dominican Republic. Thus, the government
 does not permit Haitian exiles to undertake such efforts
 against the Haitian government of President Duvalier,
 but has not resorted to sanctions harsher than deportation
 or denial of entry.
 Earlier this year, two Haitian exiles, Paul Denis
 and Robert Moise, were deported to Venezuela for allegedly
 engaging in anti-Duvalier activity. The deportations
 were criticized by some leaders of the governing party
 and by some newspapers. Eugen Athis, Secretary General
 of the Democratic Movement for Haitian Liberation,
 has successfully fought efforts to deport him in the
 courts and remains in the country.
 The only other refugee group of note in the country
 is the small Cuban community of several thousand which
 arrived in the early 1960's. They generally were
 members of the Cuban middle class and have easily
 assimilated into Dominican society. However, President
 Guzman recently announced that, because of local economic
 conditions, the government would under no conditions
 accept any more Cuban exiles or exiles of any other
 country. As in the case of Haitian exiles, the government
 has on several occasions warned Cuban exile groups
 to desist from any political activity, citing the
 previously-mentioned constitutional prohibition.
 c.   Freedom to Participate in the political
 Process
 In all, thirteen parties, including the Dominican
 Communist Party and several single-issue movements,
 participated in the 1978 elections. Opposition groups,
 including a neo-Trujilloist party, are allowed to
 exist freely. Certain opposition parties do exist
 illegally, but their condition is rooted more in their
 refusal to register with the central electoral board
 than in any government-directed policy of repression.
 The Guzman administration has taken steps to remove
 the military from politics and to institutionalize
 and professionalize the armed forces and the police,
 organizations that have previously played a decisive
 extra-constitutional role in the political system.
 Certain military and police officers with a history
 of active involvement in political matters have been
 retired or given assignments abroad by the Guzman
 administration.
 Although women's political rights have been recognized
 in legislation since 1942, they have not traditionally
 and do not now share equal social and economic status
 with men. Females hold only about 10 percent of the
 elected offices, but the secretary of the interior
 and police is a woman, and several women serve at
 the sub-cabinet level and as provincial governors,
 an appointive office. In addition, two women sit
 
 
 418
 in the 27-member Senate and 10 in the 91-member Chamber
 of Deputies. A woman also serves as interim president
 of the governing political party. President Guzman
 has announced a series of initiatives to end traditional
 discrimination against women, and Santo Domingo has
 been chosen as the site of the headquarters of the
 United Nation's International Research and Training
 Institute for the Advancement of Women.
 4.   Government Attitude and Record Regarding International
 and Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged
 violations of Human Rights
 International human rights organizations have not
 been obstructed in their investigative efforts in
 the Dominican Republic and the openness of Dominican
 society allows information about alleged abuses rapidly
 to come to the fore. Various local organizations
 are involved in reporting and commenting on human
 rights violations. They include the Dominican Union
 of Solidarity with Latin America (USDAL) and the Ecumenical
 Center for Human Rights (CEDH), both mainly concerned
 with the treatment of Haitians, and the Dominican
 Union for the Defense of Human Rights. The latter
 has criticized the government in its annual report
 for using arrest as a means of political control,
 and has taken authorities to task for prison conditions,
 police treatment of suspects, and treatment of labor
 unions. Neither these organizations nor their leaders
 have suffered for their human rights activities, although
 CEDE Executive Director Dr. Jean Claude Bajeux and
 his wife have been banned from re-entering the country,
 probably because of their political activity in the
 Haitian exile movement rather than for their involvement
 in a human rights group. Without any official hindrance,
 CEDH recently held a well-publicized seminar on the
 situation of the Haitians in the Dominican Republic
 which resulted in a final resolution strongly critical
 of both the Dominican Republic and the United States.
 The Dominican Republic participates actively in international
 and regional human rights bodies and generally supports
 human rights issues in international fora. Amnesty
 International, in its 1979 report, favorably cited
 President Guzman'a amnesty and his efforts to reform
 the prison and judicial systems and the return of
 many Dominicans previously exiled for political activity.
 Non-governmental organizations interested in human
 rights have generally been allowed free access in
 the country, and the government's posture has been
 to not discourage such investigation, even into areas
 as sensitive as the treatment of Haitian refugees
 and migrant workers.
