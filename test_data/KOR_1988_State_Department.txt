 REPUBLIC OF KOREA
 The South Korean Government describes the Republic of Korea
 (ROK) as a liberal democracy and, in fact, there were dramatic
 political changes in 1988. In February Roh Tae Woo became the
 first President directly elected by the people since 1971. At
 his inauguration, Roh proclaimed that his administration would
 be committed to democratic reform and political liberalization.
 In April National Assembly elections were held, and the
 opposition parties won control of the Assembly. The previous
 Chun Doo Hwan administration had come to power in a military
 coup in 1979 followed by an election held under strict martial
 law conditions and, many Koreans believe, maintained itself in
 power by strictly suppressing legitimate political dissent.
 As a result, the Chun regime suffered from a chronic lack of
 legitimacy in the eyes of most Koreans.
 Determined to influence government policies, the current
 opposition-dominated Assembly played a much more independent
 role in domestic politics than had previous National
 Assemblies. In the fall, the Assembly held unprecedented
 televised hearings into alleged corruption and misdeeds of the
 former Chun Doo Hwan administration. Eventually, political
 pressure forced Chun to make a public apology on nationwide
 television, relinquish his wealth, and retire to the
 countryside. On November 26 President Roh asked the nation
 for leniency for Chun, promised to release political prisoners
 and restore their civil rights, compensate victims of past
 injustices, and amend the national security laws.
 The security services have, for the first time in years, come
 under public criticism, and the opposition demanded that
 changes be made in their operations. However, in spite 3f
 some marginal changes--agents of the National Security
 Planning Agency (formerly the Korean CIA) were evicted from
 their offices in the National Assembly--the Korean security
 forces remain pervasive. Police are generally well trained
 and disciplined. While there are still credible reports of
 the excessive use of force by the police, they appear to be
 more restrained than in the past.
 Korea's political evolution has been buoyed by its dynamic,
 expanding economy. In the first half of 1988, real gross
 national product growth registered almost 12 percent. Korea
 has become the 10th largest trading nation in the world.
 Labor disputes leading to negotiations have resulted in
 sizable wage increases over the last 2 years, with per capita
 income rising in 1988 to about $3,100 from $2,300 in 1986.
 Although rapid economic growth has eliminated abject poverty,
 it also has created a number of social dislocations, including
 a rapid rise in land prices and a severe shortage of housing
 in the big cities. The Government has recently begun to
 address some of the major social welfare issues.
 Following up on progress made during the last half of 1987,
 the overall human rights situation continued to improve. The
 press enjoyed much greater freedom, and articles criticizing
 the Government appeared frequently. No major cases of torture
 or politically related killings came to light during the
 year. The major remaining human rights problem is political
 prisoners. The Roh Government has shown itself willing to
 release political prisoners in small groups. However,
 continued arrests resulted in a stable or slightly increased
 number of prisoners during much of the year. The Government
 carried out a major release of prisoners on December 21 and at
 
 
 843
 REPUBLIC OF KOREA
 the same time restored civil rights to a number of former
 political detainees. In spite of the growing spread of
 Western-style, liberal democratic thought, Korean society
 still places great emphasis on the Confucian ideals of order
 and conformity. While the pace of positive political change
 is accelerating and the Roh Government's commitment to
 democratization seems firm, the evolution of South Korea's
 democracy is not yet complete.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 In contrast to 1987, when one student was tortured to death
 and one died from wounds suffered when he was hit in the head
 by shrapnel from a teargas grenade, there were no reported
 cases of politically related deaths-in 1988.
 b. Disappearance
 In 1988 there were a number of reports of union organizers
 disappearing temporarily. In most cases these activists were
 held for a short time-by people hired by a company to
 intimidate, bribe, or sometimes beat them into halting their
 organizing activities. There is no indication that the
 Government sponsors these kidnapings. In the most widely
 publicized case, the June kidnaping of a union activist at
 Hyundai construction company, the men who carried out the
 kidnaping and the company executives who ordered it were all
 arrested. Two executives were indicted and are awaiting
 trial. The chairman of the company was also charged with
 complicity in the case, and he too is awaiting trial.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 There were no reports of physical torture in 1988. During the
 summer a policeman convicted of sexually abusing a female
 detainee during a 1987 interrogation was sentenced to 5 years
 in prison. At times the Korean police still use excessive
 force, particularly when breaking up demonstrations. Police
 violence was particularly evident in mid-August when radical
 students attempted to organize a march to Panmunjom to meet
 with students from North Korea. However, students have been
 increasingly escalating the level of violence during their
 demonstrations, throwing Molotov cocktails and using various
 kinds of clubs. As a matter of policy, the police refrained
 from using tear gas on student demonstrators (except on one
 occasion) during the Olympics-. Riot police do not carry
 firearms and rarely conduct baton charges.
 Harsh treatment of prisoners still prevails. Many human
 rights activists report that political prisoners are sometimes
 deprived of sleep and that prison authorities frequently
 attempt to intimidate prisoners through severe psychological
 pressure.
 Late in the year the Government announced a prison reform
 measure. If fully implemented, this reform would allow
 inmates greater access to books, newspapers, and television as
 well as allowing them to correspond with and receive visits
 from anyone they wish.
 
 
 844
 REPUBLIC OF KOREA
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Although Koreans are freer to criticize the Government than in
 the past, Korea's sweeping National Security Law is still used
 against people who express views the Government considers
 dangerous. Arrests of students and dissidents under the
 security laws continued throughout 1988, although apparently
 in lesser numbers than in years past. Human rights activists
 put the number of new political arrests at about 400 for the
 period February through August. According to the Government,
 211 "security-related" arrests were recorded during the first
 6 months of the year, 48 fewer arrests than for the same
 period in 1987. This total number includes 46 arrests under
 the National Security Law, which was 40 fewer than for the
 same period last year.
 Large numbers of students were detained during demonstrations
 in June and August calling for South/North student talks.
 Most of the detainees were quickly released, but a number of
 "ringleaders" were charged with various violations of the
 National Security Law. Although the Government tentatively
 began to increase access to materials originating from North
 Korea, a number of people were still arrested for spreading
 North Korean propaganda. Among them were the authors of
 articles on North Korea's Juche philosophy which appeared in
 various university newspapers in the fall. Some of the
 students arrested in these cases were freed without trial,
 while others were tried and given suspended sentences.
 Warrants are required by law, but in many cases they are not
 presented at the time of arrest. Many people are still
 detained for more than 48 hours without being formally
 arrested, in spite of a 1985 Supreme Court decision requiring
 police either to charge or release suspects within that period
 of time. In such cases police sometimes justify holding
 people more than 48 hours by claiming that suspects held in
 police offices--but not in cells--were not actually under
 detention. Police are also required to notify a suspect's
 family or lawyer of his or her detention and whereabouts
 within 3 days of making a formal arrest. By law an indictment
 must be handed down within 30 days of arrest. However, these
 requirements are not always observed.
 Korean law provides for the right to representation by an
 attorney. However, not all people are aware of their right to
 counsel nor are all people able to afford counsel. There is a
 functioning bail system in Korea, but it does not apply to
 violators of the security laws. Likewise, habeas corpus,
 which is not traditional in Korean law and was introduced only
 after World War II and then abolished for several years during
 the 1970's, does not apply to those charged with violating the
 National Security Law.
 Korea's "Social Stability Act" gives the Government authority
 to detain those deemed "socially dangerous" even after they
 have served their court-ordered term in prison. Under the
 Act, a judicial panel can order preventive detention for a
 renewable period of 2 years. The Government maintains that
 this provision is applied mainly against security-related
 offenders such as North Korean spies. A similar law, the "Act
 for the Protection of Society," allows for preventive
 detention for periods of either 7 or 10 years. The Government
 says the Act is designed for habitual criminals, the mentally
 ill, and drug addicts.
 
 
 845
 REPUBLIC OF KOREA
 Two of the better known prisoners held under the Social
 Stability Act, Soh Joon Shik and Kang Jong Kon, were released
 in 1988. Mr. Soh's original prison term had run out in 1978;
 Mr. Kang's in 1981. The Government refuses on security
 grounds to reveal the number of people held under the Social
 Stability Act. However, members of the National Assembly who
 visited the Preventive Detention Center in Chongju in October
 said that 42 people are being held there, including North
 Korean "espionage agents" and "spontaneous Communists." The
 average age of the prisoners is around 64, and most have been
 in jail for at least 30 years. In 1988 the Government stopped
 using preventive house arrest against political opponents as
 it had commonly done in the past. Summary exile did not occur
 in 1988. In November President Roh promised to revise the
 nondemocratic provisions of the National Security Law, the
 Social Stability Law, and the Social Protection Law. The
 Government and opposition parties have submitted competing
 draft bills to the National Assembly.
 With regard to forced or compulsory labor, see Section 6.c.
 e. Denial of a Fair Public Trial
 The Constitution (as amended in 1987) provides for many rights
 to defendants, including a presumption of innocence, protection
 against self-incrimination, freedom from ex-post facto laws
 and double jeopardy, and the right to a speedy trial. These
 rights are generally observed. With some exceptions, trials
 must be held within 6 months of arrest.
 The Chief Justice of the Supreme Court is appointed by the
 President with the consent of the National Assembly. Other
 Supreme Court Justices are appointed by the President on the
 advice of the Chief Justice. Lower Court Justices are
 appointed by the Chief Justice. In the spring of 1988, a
 revolt by younger lawyers led to the resignation of the
 incumbent Chief Justice of the Supreme Court. In July the
 National Assembly rejected the President's first nominee for
 the position before agreeing on a compromise candidate.
 There have been a number of indications of increased judicial
 independence since the new Chief Justice was approved by the
 National Assembly in July. For the first time in the ROK's
 history, the Chief Justice gave the President no alternate
 names in submitting a list of nominees for the Supreme Court,
 and the President approved the list with no changes. The
 Constitutional Court, established under the 1987 Constitution,
 began its operations in September 1988 and agreed to rule on
 the constitutionality of several controversial security-related
 laws by mid-1989. Appellate courts, responding to suits by
 two torture victims, have forced the Government to try police
 officers on torture charges. One case resulted in the
 conviction of a police officer in 1988. However, there are
 still questions about the judiciary's independence in
 politically sensitive cases, such as those involving the
 relatives of former President Chun Doo Hwan.
 Most trials are open to the public, but attendance is
 occasionally restricted, particularly at political trials. In
 some cases most of the passes to the courtroom are issued to
 the police, leaving no room for other interested parties,
 although families are normally allowed into the courtroom.
 Judges generally allow considerable scope for examination of
 witnesses by both the prosecution and defense counsel, but
 sometimes deny defense requests to call expert witnesses to
 
 
 846
 REPUBLIC OF KOREA
 discuss the political or ideological leanings of the
 defendants. The right to an attorney is respected in
 political cases, although the attorney is sometimes denied
 permission to meet with defendants until after they are
 referred to prosecutors by the police or one of the
 security/investigative agencies.
 In lengthy and complex indictments, the relationship between
 alleged specific acts and violations of particular sections of
 the penal code is not always clearly drawn. In cases
 involving both political and criminal charges, this lack of
 clarity can bring into question the fairness of the
 proceedings. Political and criminal cases are tried by the
 same courts; military courts do not try civilians. Defendants
 have the right of appeal in felony cases, and appeals
 frequently result in reduced sentences. Death sentences are
 automatically appealed.
 From the inauguration of the Sixth Republic in February
 through early October, the Government proclaimed a series of
 amnesties and paroles resulting in the release of over 400
 prisoners. In the fall, human rights sources said that a like
 number of new arrests were made, and the number of political
 prisoners in Korea still hovered around the 500 to 600 mark.
 On November 26, President Roh Tae Woo announced a major
 release of political prisoners. In'early December, the
 Government freed a number of people under detention but not
 yet charged with politically related crimes. Then on December
 21, the Government released 281 political prisoners, including
 such well-known dissidents as Chang Ki Pyo, Mun Pu Sik, and
 Kim Hyon Jang. The Government also restored civil rights to a
 number of former political detainees and called off police
 manhunts for those on the wanted list for political offenses.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Many political, religious, and other dissidents are subjected
 to varying degrees of surveillance by government agents.
 Telephone tapping and the opening or interception of
 correspondence are believed to be prevalent. Responding to
 questions from the opposition during the National Assembly
 audit, the Government gave details about some of these
 activities for the first time. For example, the Minister of
 Communications admitted that 472 officials work at intercepting
 and reading letters of people targeted by the National
 Security Planning Agency (NSPA). The opposition responded
 with promises to enact a law to forbid wiretapping except in
 bona fide cases of espionage. The ruling party has said that
 it has no objections to such a law.
 Listening to North Korean radio broadcasts is strictly
 prohibited by law, in spite of the fact that the Government in
 September relaxed restrictions on access to certain North
 Korean newspapers and publications. Reading or purveying
 books or other literature considered subversive, pro-Communist,
 or pro-North Korea is also illegal. As in previous years,
 several people--mainly students--were arrested under the
 National Security Law for these kinds of offenses.
 The Constitution requires a warrant issued by a judge upon
 request of a prosecutor for search and seizure in a residence.
 Nonetheless, the police at times force their way into a
 private home or office without a warrant.
 
 
 847
 REPUBLIC. OF KOREA
 The security presence in city centers, near university
 campuses, government and ruling party offices, and media
 outlets is heavy. Citizens, particularly students and young
 people, are sometimes stopped, questioned, and searched.
 Government informants are known to be posted on and around
 university campuses. This presence is designed to keep track
 of political activities on campus, and has been a key
 complaint of students as well as of many faculty members and
 administrators.
 In most other respects, the Government honors the right of
 personal privacy and the integrity of the-home and family.
 Parental rights to educate children are broad. Persons
 thought to have politically suspect backgrounds, however, are
 still denied some forms of employment and advancement,
 particularly in government, media, and education. Many human
 rights activists say that the Government no longer maintains a
 blacklist, but that the big corporations still retain an
 informal blacklist system of their own.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Although freedom of speech is provided for in the Constitution
 the expression of ideas which the Government considers to be
 Communist or pro-North Korean is severely restricted. The
 expression of less radical opposition points of view is far
 less restricted than in the past. Articles on previously
 taboo subjects, such as criticism of the President and his
 family, now appear with some regularity. The Government bas
 promised to allow greater media coverage of North Korea, while
 at the same time issuing guidelines for media reporting on it.
 Freedom of speech is provided for in the Constitution. In
 1988 the Government less rigorously enforced laws restricting
 the expression of ideas considered to be Communist or
 pro-North Korean, and has announced that it will amend such
 laws. Government control over the media, especially the print
 media, has decreased dramatically. Some institutions remain
 basically inaccessible to journalists, however, including the
 military, the National Security Planning Agency, and other
 government organizations which handle North Korean or
 Communist affairs.
 Under new laws that replaced the basic press law, the
 Hankyoreh Shinmun, an antigovernment, antiestablishment daily
 newspaper was launched in May. Staffed by dissident
 journalists, many of whom had been "purged" under previous
 governments, the newspaper has a circulation estimated at more
 than 300,000. Despite the paper's highly critical editorials
 and provocative reporting, the Government apparently has not
 attempted to interfere with its operations or its content.
 Several new magazines were also introduced in 1988, and as
 many as 20 new newspapers appeared nationwide by the end of
 the year, including 10 in Seoul alone. The new law governing
 the registration of publications, however, serves to prohibit
 the mushrooming of a number of small publications by setting
 minimum standards for printing capacity that would-be
 publishers must meet.
 The year 1988 also saw the .rise of unions in Korean newspaper
 and broadcasting organizations. Young journalists in
 particular see the movement toward unionization as a way to
 
 
 848
 REPUBLIC OF KOREA
 institutionalize the principles of fair news coverage and
 independence from both government and management. All major
 newspapers and broadcasting corporations in Seoul now have
 labor unions with the exception of the Chosun Ilbo.
 The Korean broadcasting industry has not undergone the same
 degree of change as has the press. Although various proposals
 to restructure broadcasting organizations have been put
 forward, no consensus has been reached. Throughout much of
 the year the Government's influence on most aspects of radio
 and television remained strong. However, by the end of the
 year even television programming was freer. A number of panel
 discussions were broadcast in which participants were critical
 of government policy. Conservatives have even begun to
 complain that the pendulum has swung back too far.
 In early August, Oh Hong Kun, City Desk Editor of the Joongang
 Economic Daily, was beaten and stabbed in the leg. Under
 pressure from the public and the media, an investigation
 revealed that the perpetrators were members of a military
 intelligence unit acting under orders from general officers.
 The attack was apparently intended to intimidate journalists
 such as Oh, who had written an article highly critical of the
 Korean military's history of involvement in politics. Many
 Koreans felt the entire incident revealed much about the
 country's new state of affairs. The very publication of such
 an article was a good demonstration of the greater degree of
 press freedom since the summer of 1987. The attack confirmed
 to many that old patterns of repression remained. Although
 the court decided to suspend the sentences against the
 perpetrators, the Government's actions against the military
 personnel involved in the affair demonstrated its newfound
 sensitivity to public opinion.
 The Government continues to use the National Security Law
 against publishers, printers, and distributors for producing
 or selling "subversive, ideological" literature. In September
 a number of students were arrested for writing articles on
 North Korean "Juche" philosophy in their college newspapers.
 Most of these students were later released outright or given
 suspended sentences. These cases came at the same time the
 Government was beginning to allow carefully controlled access
 to North Korean newspapers.
 Academic freedom continues to be subject to political
 limitations enforced directly or indirectly by the
 Government. Professors and university administrators are
 expected to play an active role in preventing campus
 demonstrations, a task many find objectionable. There is
 rising sentiment for greater university autonomy. In the
 spring, the rector of Seoul National University threatened to
 resign after police came on campus without his permission to
 arrest students occupying his office. There is also a threat
 to academic freedom from radical leftist students who
 physically attack the person or property of professors whose
 lectures or writings contradict these students' ideology.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The law on assemblies and demonstrations prohibits assemblies
 considered likely to "undermine" public order. The law also
 requires that demonstrations of all types, including political
 assemblies, be reported in advance to the police. Violation
 of the law carries a maximum sentence of 7 years' imprisonment
 or a fine. However, most peaceful nonpolitical assemblies
 
 
 849
 REPUBLIC OF KOREA
 take place entirely without official supervision or
 restriction. In 1988 the Government began to permit a small
 number of political demonstrations, such as a 2-hour march
 through Seoul by between 1,000 and 2,000 people on the 35th
 anniversary of the Korean War Armistice.
 However, the Government continues to block many gatherings
 organized by dissidents and particularly students, arguing
 that they might incite "social unrest" and are therefore
 illegal. Student rallies and demonstrations limited to
 university campuses are generally not blocked, but police
 usually prevent the students from taking to the streets, and
 confrontations frequently ensue. These clashes sometimes
 involve violence on both sides.
 For a discussion of freedom of association as it applies to
 labor unions, see Section 6.a.
 c. Freedom of, Religion
 There is no state-favored religion in Korea. Generally
 complete freedom prevails for proselytizing, doctrinal
 teaching, and conversion. Korea both sends and receives
 missionaries of various faiths, and many religious groups in
 Korea maintain active links with members of similar faiths in
 other countries. The Government and Koreans in general do not
 discriminate against minority sects. Adherence to a particulaT
 faith confers neither advantages nor disadvantages in civil,
 military, or official life.
 Churches and religious groups are subject to most of the
 restrictions on political activities that apply to other
 institutions. Many of the most vocal and well-organized
 critics of the Government are religious in nature; these
 include Catholic, Protestant, and Buddhist groups. Police
 continue to enter church property on occasion, either during
 services or when church property is being used by political or
 labor activists. Church buildings and gTounds are sometimes
 used as refuge by student activists during clashes with the
 police, and the police generally respect the principle of
 sanctuary in those cases.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 There is universal freedom of movement and freedom to change
 employment within Korea. Throughout 1988 there was an age
 limit on overseas tourist travel that prevented such travel
 for most young and middle-aged people. According to the
 Government, this policy was designed to save scarce hard
 currency. In July the Government announced that the dramatic
 improvement in Korea's economic situation would allow them to
 lower the minimum age limit. It is expected that the age
 limit will be dropped completely on January 1, 1989.
 A small number of Indochinese refugees continues to be
 admitted to temporary first asylum in Korea. The refugees are
 cared for at a camp in Pusan by the Korean Red Cross until
 they can be resettled abroad.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 The previous Korean regime--the Fifth Republic, which ended on
 February 25, 1988--came to power in a military coup followed
 
 
 850
 REPUBLIC OF KOREA
 by an election held under strict martial law conditions. As a
 result, the regime suffered from a chronic lack of legitimacy
 in the eyes of most Koreans. The Sixth Republic came into
 being in February 1988 following a direct presidential
 election in December 1987 in which the ruling Democratic
 Justice Party (DJP) candidate, Roh Tae Woo, defeated three
 opposition candidates with a plurality of 36 percent of the
 vote.
 Political power in Korea has traditionally been centered in
 the person of the President, strongly supported by the
 military and security agencies. With the election of the
 opposition-dominated 13th National Assembly in April 1988,
 however, the legislature began to play a much greater role
 than it did in the past.
 As amended in 1987, the Constitution provides for direct
 election of the President and for a mixed system of both
 direct and proportional election of national assemblymen.
 There is as yet no local autonomy in Korea. The President and
 the Assembly--a total of 294 men and 6 women--are the only
 elected officials in the country. The Government and the
 Assembly have vowed to make progress on legislation to
 increase local autonomy.
 The President serves a 5-year term and cannot be reelected.
 The Assembly's term is 4 years, and under the new Constitution
 the President has been stripped of his power to dissolve it.
 Following his election in December 1987, Roh Tae Woo was
 inaugurated as President on February 25, 1988, marking the
 beginning of the Sixth Republic.
 The April legislative elections were contested by four major
 and a host of minor parties. As was the case in the
 presidential election, voting was on the basis of universal
 suffrage and secret balloting. During the presidential
 election, there were widespread charges that soldiers in many
 military units were not allowed to cast their absentee ballots
 in secret. This does not generally seem to have been the case
 during the legislative election.
 Coming into the April elections, the ruling DJP was confident
 of victory against a split opposition. However, the ruling
 party suffered a major defeat when the voters failed to return
 a DJP majority. At present the three main opposition parties
 are a majority in the Assembly, although they do not always
 work together. The minor parties which put up candidates for
 the legislature were all dissolved after failing to get the
 minimum required vote.
 Since the new Assembly was inaugurated in late spring, it has
 played a much more independent role than any previous
 Assembly. Following the spring resignation of the Chief
 Justice of the Supreme Court, the Assembly refused to confirm
 the President's first nominee for the position. The Assembly
 also passed laws on parliamentary inspection of the Government
 and on the Assembly's right to subpoena witnesses over the
 opposition of the Government. Following a presidential veto,
 compromise versions of both bills were worked out. In October
 the Assembly took a major step towards asserting its position
 vis-a-vis the Executive, carrying out its first audit of the
 Government in over 16 years. In November the Assembly began
 televised hearings on corruption during the Fifth Republic and
 the Kwangju incident of 1980. These hearings have drawn
 remarkable public interest, and many credit them with vastly
 
 
 851
 REPUBLIC OF KOREA
 increasing public consciousness of the constitutional process
 and political issues.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Republic of Korea does not welcome outside involvement
 with respect to human rights. Nevertheless, government and
 ruling party officials have generally been willing to meet
 with international human rights groups such as Amnesty
 International, the International Human Rights Law Group, and
 Asia Watch. The Government also allowed the Kennedy
 Foundatfon in May to present its human rights award to
 prominent dissident Kim Keun Tae (in absentia) and his wife in
 a ceremony in Seoul. (Kim Keun Tae was later released on June
 30.) The Government also did not interfere with human
 rights-related activities of the international PEN
 organization during its August conference in Seoul nor with
 the foreign observers at the hotly contested December 1987
 Presidential election.
 According to the Government, public prosecutors and the Human
 Rights Division of the Ministry of Justice are responsible for
 protecting human rights and investigating violations. The
 Government has admitted that some human rights problems
 remain, but argues that it has taken steps to address these
 problems and that the situation has improved greatly since
 mid-1987.
 The National Assembly and the major political parties all have
 committees concerned with various aspects of human rights.
 The issue of the release of political prisoners continued to
 be a focus of intraparty debate in 1988.
 Several politically nonaffiliated private organizations are
 active in promoting human rights. Chief among these groups
 are the Human Rights Committee of the Korean National Council
 of Churches; the Catholic Justice and Peace Committee; the
 Family Members Movement for the Realization of Democracy
 (Mingahyop); the Korean Federal Bar Association, and the Korea
 Legal Aid Center in Seoul. These groups publish reports on
 the human rights situation in Korea and make their views known
 both inside and outside the country.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 The Republic of Korea is a densely populated and racially
 homogeneous country. There are no ethnic minorities of
 significant size. Nonetheless, regional rivalries exist in
 Korea. Many Koreans believe that persons from the
 southwestern region (North and South Cholla provinces) have
 traditionally faced some discrimination, and that successive
 governments led predominantly by figures from southeast Korea
 (North and South Kyongsang provinces) and other areas have
 neglected the economic development of the Cholla provinces.
 In his August 31 meeting with Kim Dae Jung, leader of the
 largest opposition party in the assembly--a party which has
 its major base of support in the Cholla region--President Roh
 Tae Woo promised to make particular efforts to encourage the
 development of the Cholla region, including an ambitious
 project for the development of Korea's west coast ports.
 
 
 852
 REPUBLIC OF KOREA
 In Korea, with its conservative Confucian tradition, women are
 subordinate to men socially, economically, and legally. Some
 progress has been made: women can vote, become government
 officials, and hold elected office. All female candidates for
 the National Assembly lost their races, but six women were
 able to join the Assembly via the proportional party lists.
 Women enjoy full access to educational opportunities, and they
 are being increasingly represented, although still largely at
 lower levels, in the Government and private sector. In the
 workplace, women are exposed to discrimination in hiring, pay,
 and advancement. They are commonly expected to resign when
 they marry or become pregnant.
 Despite a constitutional guarantee of equal rights for men and
 women, traditional social customs are still reflected in the
 law, particularly in family law. Although family law has been
 amended to take out some forms of discrimination, others still
 remain. Women are legally prohibited from becoming head of
 household in Korea, although they can hold property in their
 own name. Should a woman be widowed, her oldest son or
 grandson becomes head of the household, regardless of age.
 Within the family, the father has final parental rights over
 children in a case of disagreement with the mother. Women
 also do not have equal status in child custody in case of
 divorce. Women's rights groups are actively campaigning for
 changes in. family law.
 In 1988 the National Assembly enacted the Equal Employment
 Opportunity Law. This sets out the principle of no sex-based
 discrimination in hiring and wages. It also calls for greater
 protection for women in terms of conditions of work (e.g., no
 night work and limits on overtime). However, the law contains
 no enforcement provisions and has had no practical effect so
 far.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Although the Constitution provides for workers to have the
 rights to independent association, collective bargaining, and
 collective action, in practice this has often not been the
 case. Strikes are prohibited in government agencies, state or
 public-run enterprises-, defense industries, and certain other
 enterprises "which have a serious impact on the national
 economy." During 1988, however, the Government has generally
 been unwilling to enforce these prohibitions as well as many
 other provisions of the labor law. Labor laws include
 complicated notification procedures and 15-day "cooling-off
 periods" before a strike can be called legally. Only one
 union is allowed at each place of work. As there is no
 minimum number of members required to form a union, this
 facilitates the formation of small, company-controlled
 unions. Once such a union is formed, it is difficult to
 replace it with a more representative union.
 All unions in Korea must be certified by the Government.
 However, during a wave of labor unrest in the fall of 1987, a
 large number of unions were formed and began negotiations with
 employers before being formally certified. As long as
 certification was completed eventually, the Government did not
 attempt to decertify these unions. This marked a complete
 reversal of past practice. In the fall of 1988, the Government
 registered the first union federation not associated with the
 conservative Federation of Korean Trade Unions (FKTU), thus
 
 
 853
 REPUBLIC OF KOREA
 breaking the FKTU's monopoly. Up until that time, the FKTU
 had virtual veto power over union registration. Whether the
 registration of this new federation is a break with the past
 or simply a single-case exception is unclear.
 The FKTU is affiliated with the International Confederation of
 Free Trade Unions. Most of its constituent unions maintain
 affiliations with international trade secretariats.
 There is no independent system of labor courts in Korea. The
 Central and Local Labor Committees form a semiautonomous
 agency of the Ministry of Labor that adjudicates disputes in
 accordance with the Labor Dispute Adjustment Law. Each labor
 committee is composed of equal representation from labor,
 management, and "the public interest." The Local Labor
 Committees are empowered to decide on remedial measures in
 cases involving unfair labor practices and to mediate and
 arbitrate labor disputes. Most disputes are resolved at the
 Local Labor Committee level.
 -in 1988 the Government generally stayed out of Labor
 disputes. One exception was a strike by railroad engineets.
 The Government moved decisively to break this strike, which
 was illegal under Korean law.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 The Constitution provides for independent association,
 collective bargaining, and collective action. In practice,
 however, this has often not been the case. Korea's system of
 labor laws does not extend the right to bargain collectively
 to government employees and employees of state or public-run
 enterprises, defense industries, and certain other key
 industries. A 1985 law provides that worker rights are not to
 be handled differently in export processing zones (EPZ's). In
 practice, equal treatment in EPZ's has been the norm only
 since the summer of 1987.
 anfy of Korea's major employers are strongly antivnion. *Save
 the Company Squads" are employed to beat up union organizers
 and intimidate workers. Labor activists say they have
 documentary evidence of at least 30 instances of attacks on
 union organizers by company-hired strong-arm men. As
 mentioned in the section on disappearances, there are still
 cases of labor organizers being kidnaped. While uncommon,
 there have been cases of violence against property by workers,
 sometimes resulting in a good deal of property damage.
 C. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Forced or compulsory labor is not practiced by the
 Government. A 1987 scandal involving a government-subsidized
 welfare center for the destitute in Pusan revealed that many
 inmates were being held against their will and made to engage
 in forced labor. However, a subsequent investigation
 indicated that the Government was not directly involved,
 although there was gross negligence on the part of local
 officials.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 The Korean Labor Standards Law prohibits the employment of
 persons under the age of 13 without a special employment
 certificate from the Ministry of Labor. However, because
 there is compulsory education until the age of 13, few special
 
 
 854
 REPUBLIC OF KOREA
 employment certificates are issued for full time employment.
 Some children are allowed to do part-time jobs such as selling
 newspapers. In order to gain employment, children under 18
 must have written approval from parents or guardian. Minors
 may be required to work only a limited amount of overtime and
 are prohibited from working at night without special permission
 from the Ministry of Labor. Nevertheless, employers often
 treat those under 18 as "regular" workers, and do not accord
 them the legal protections to which they are entitled. A
 large proportion of production line workers in labor-intensive
 industries such as textiles, apparel, footwear, and electronics
 are girls in their midteens. These girls work often in small,
 cramped and sometimes dangerous workplaces.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 Korea implemented a minimum wage law in 1988. There is a
 two-tiered minimum wage system, and minimum wage levels are to
 be reviewed annually. The minimum wage for some industries
 like textiles is $150 per month, for other industries it is
 $158 per month. In many small establishments, below-minimum
 wages are still paid.
 A survey conducted by a team from Seoul National University on
 commission from the Federation of Korean Trade Unions (FKTU)
 concludes that a single, urban industrial worker requires a
 minimum salary of $187 per month and a couple about $354 per
 month, well above the minimum wage level. However, the
 Ministry of Labor (MOL) asserts that the average Korean blue-
 collar worker takes home quite a bit more money than his basic
 salary. According to MOL, basic pay accounts for only about
 65 percent of a worker's total remuneration, with the rest
 consisting of overtime and bonuses. Current Bank of Korea
 statistics report that the average monthly wage for industrial
 workers in the third quarter of 1988 was $481.
 Income distribution in Korea is quite good when compared to
 other countries at similar levels of economic development. In
 1985, the top 20 percent of all households earned 43.7 percent
 of national income, while the lowest 40 percent of all
 households earned 17.7 percent of national income. Korea's
 Economic Planning Board estimates that the 1988 average
 monthly earnings for workers in industrial establishments
 employing 10 or more persons were $578 per month, up $108 over
 the previous year. Pockets of urban poverty still remain, but
 the abject poverty common to many developing countries has
 largely been eliminated. According to a 1986 government
 estimate, 6.8 percent of the population lived below the
 absolute poverty line.
 The Labor Standards Law and the Industrial Safety and Health
 Law provide for a maximum 60-hour workweek, paid overtime,
 holidays and vacation, and a safe working environment.
 According to the Government, the average Korean worker works
 51.9 hours a week. The Labor Ministry is studying ways to
 reduce the average workweek to 44-48 hours.
