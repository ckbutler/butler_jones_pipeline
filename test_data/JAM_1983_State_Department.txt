 JAMAICA
 Jamaica is a constitutional parliamentary democracy with a
 mixed economy which emphasizes increasing opportunity for
 private enterprise. It is a member of the British Common-
 wealth. The Governor General represents the Queen, while an
 elected Prime Minister is the country's chief executive.
 Two major political parties, the Jamaica Labour Party and the
 People's National Party, have alternated in power since the
 first elections were held under universal adult suffrage in
 1944. The Jamaica Labour Party's leader, Edward Seaga, has
 been Prime Minister since November 1980. The Jamaican Consti-
 tution requires that general, free elections be held at least
 once every five years. In November 1983, Prime Minister Seaga
 called for elections to be held December 15. Because an
 outdated voters' list was being used, the People's National
 Party decided to boycott the election and only six of the 60
 House of Representatives seats were contested. The Jamaica
 Labour Party gained all six seats and, therefore, has full
 control of the Parliament.
 The relatively small, apolitical security apparatus comes under
 the Ministry of National Security and consists of the Jamaica
 Constabulary Force, the Jamaica Special Constabulary Force, and
 the Jamaica Defense Force. Since 1981 the Jamaica Defense
 Force has been authorized to conduct joint operations with the
 police in order to maintain the peace under the Suppression of
 Crime Act. The police have been charged with killing suspected
 criminals rather than arresting them. The Government has
 investigated these allegations and brought charges in several
 cases.
 Jamaica, independent since August 6, 1962, has a largely
 literate population of 2,335,000. The per capita income is
 about $1,200. The economy is mixed: while the private sector
 plays a large and active role, government influence is strong.
 The Seaga Government's policy is to increase the role of the
 private sector by divesting itself of some of its interests and
 aggresively promoting new local and foreign commercial invest-
 ment. The economy declined in 1983 as exports and foreign
 exchange earnings fell off. Budgetary reductions and increased
 unemployment have accompanied this trend.
 Jamaica continues to maintain its good human rights record.
 There is a deeply rooted respect for human rights, grounded in
 British common law. An independent judiciary is supported by
 Jamaica's open society and democratic traditions.
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Unlawful or Arbitrary Deprivation of Life
 Officially sanctioned murder of political opponents does not
 occur in Jamaica. Jamaica suffers from a high level of violent
 crime, some of which is politically motivated but none of which
 is sanctioned or condoned by the Government or senior leaders
 of either of the two principal political parties. Most of this
 has been associated with election campaigns. The two major
 parties, as well as the Communist Workers Party of Jamaica,
 have supporters who employ violence for political purposes. On
 the whole, the legal system has been unable to bring the guilty
 parties to justice because of a pervasive code of silence and
 intimidation enforced at the local level. During the past year
 (616)
 
 
 617
 the ruling Jamaica Labour Party and the opposition People's
 National Party began discussing ways to curb political violence
 and tension. The 1983 election, which was uncontested in all
 but 6 constituencies, was quiet, with minimal violence and no
 deaths.
 Some political leaders, religious groups, and others have
 charged that the police have used excessive violence and are
 too quick to kill in their efforts to combat criminals and
 gunmen. In July 1983, in response to charges of police
 "lawlessness," the Police Commissioner stated that high-level
 investigations are routinely carried out in all cases of fatal
 shootings by the police and the files submitted to the Director
 of Public Prosecutions for a ruling.
 During 1983 nine policemen were charged with murder for acts
 committed while on duty. Several were acquitted, while some
 await trial. None was convicted in 1983. The Complaints
 Department of the police conducts an initial investigation into
 all charges of police abuse. It refers cases to the Criminal
 Investigations Branch or the Director of Public Prosecutions
 when warranted. All complaints receive a written reply.
 Complaints against the police may also be directed to the
 courts, to the parliamentary ombudsman, or to the media. In
 several cases in 1983, groups of citizens demonstrated to
 protest alleged use of excessive force by the Constabulary.
 There were no known killings by terrorists in Jamaica in 1983.
 b. Disappearance
 There is no evidence of abduction, hostage-taking, or disap-
 pearances carried out by official forces. But individuals do
 disappear and are later discovered dead. The victims are
 frequently connected with criminal cases or have been accused
 of being police "informers."
 c.  Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Legal prohibitions against torture and cruel, inhuman or
 degrading treatment or punishment are respected. Access to
 detainees by relatives, attorneys, physicians, and friends is
 routine. Prison conditions are austere and urban prisons over-
 crowded. There have been occasional claims in the press of
 unjustified killings, beatings, and other abuses by police, and
 the Communist Workers Party of Jamaica has periodically charged
 the police force with politically motivated harassment. Most
 observers believe that there is a small minority of individuals
 within the police force who abuse their authority, especially
 during operations against criminal gunmen. Officials involved
 in the abuse of prisoners are liable to punishment, and citi-
 zens bringing such charges through the Government or through
 the courts have won compensatory damages.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 There are no political prisoners in Jamaica. The security
 forces do not need a warrant in order to arrest persons
 "reasonably" suspected of having committed a crime. The
 Suppression of Crime Act, which has been extended for 180-day
 periods since January 1981, limits the period of detention to a
 
 
 618
 "reasonable time" before being charged. The detainee must be
 brought before a court "without delay." Practice is for
 appearance before a magistrate or court on the next court day,
 normally within a few days of arrest. In case of a further
 delay, authorities must indicate why the person is being held
 longer.
 Arbitrary detention without trial has not been reported,
 although the opposition has charged irregularities in preven-
 tive detention practices by the police.
 Habeas corpus is implicit in the Constitution, rooted in common
 law, and respected by the courts and the police. The Constitu-
 tion guarantees that a detained person must be informed of
 charges against him "within a reasonable amount of time."
 There is a functioning system of bail used on a discretionary
 basis.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Jamaica has an independent judiciary. The Court of Appeal and
 the Parliament may refer cases to the Judicial Committee of the
 Privy Council in the United Kingdom. Persons who have been
 charged with a criminal offense have access to legal represen-
 tation, and legal counsel is provided to indigents in criminal
 cases. The legal system is overburdened, and many cases take
 years to come to trial.
 In addition to the regular courts, there is also the Gun Court,
 which was established in 1974 as an extraordinary means of
 dealing with the serious problem of violent crime. It
 considers cases involving the illegal use or the possession of
 firearms or ammunition. There are restrictions on public
 attendance and less stringent rules of evidence in the Gun
 Court. Hearings are conducted before a judge, except in murder
 cases, which require a jury.
 The Gun Court has been an increasingly controversial subject in
 Jamaica. In early 1983 the Gun Court Amendment Act eliminated
 the previously mandatory sentence of life imprisonment, gave
 all resident magistrates more leeway to grant bail, fix trial
 dates, etc., and gave magistrates outside of the Kingston area
 discretion in referring non-capital offense cases to the Gun
 Court. The amended Act also removed cases involving children
 under the age of 14 to juvenile courts. Hundreds of persons,
 whose average age is 21, are serving life sentences imposed
 before amendment of the Gun Court act. Their cases are
 currently under review.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Constitution prohibits arbitrary intrusion of the state
 into the private life of the individual. Individual rights are
 protected, and there are no reports of monitored correspondence
 or telephones, nor restrictions on receipt of foreign publica-
 tions. Search warrants are not required to enter homes or
 businesses when crime is suspected. However, regulations
 approved by Parliament in 1980 require that every effort be
 made by the security forces to have the owner or occupant of
 the premises present during the search.
 
 
 619
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Freedom of speech and press are guaranteed in the Constitution
 and are observed in practice within the broad limits of libel
 laws and the State Secrets Act. There is no censorship nor is
 there interference in academic studies. Jamaica's principal,
 privately owned daily newspaper, The Daily Gleaner, has been
 critical of Jamaican Governments. The Gleaner Company also
 runs a widely distributed afternoon tabloid.  The government-
 owned Daily News failed in April 1983 due to financial
 problems. Several smaller newspapers and magazines are also
 published, including two by the opposition parties. Both of
 the opposition party papers are highly critical of government
 policies. Foreign publications are usually available in a
 limited number of copies.
 In February 1983 the Minister of Tourism and Information asked
 foreign and local news not to report prominently a major
 robbery; he criticized heavy local news coverage of the crime
 for having a negative impact on the tourist industry. The
 ensuing debate on the Minister's statement far exceeded
 coverage of the incident itself, and Jamaica's freedom of the
 press was strongly reaffirmed.
 Jamaica's one television station is government owned, although
 an intention to issue licenses to potential competitors has
 been announced. The government-owned television and radio
 network has historically been accused of bias in favor of the
 Government by whichever party is not in power. The second
 radio station, while partially government owned, is politically
 independent.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Freedom of assembly and association are guaranteed in the
 Constitution. A large variety of professional groups and
 private associations function freely. Public demonstrations
 and rallies are staged by all political parties without govern-
 ment interference. Public demonstrations require police
 permits, which are normally granted. One exception to this
 occurred in October 1983, when the Communist Workers Party of
 Jamaica planned a demonstration to protest U.S. military
 involvement in Grenada; permission to demonstrate was denied by
 the authorities.
 Approximately 25 percent of the Jamaican work force is orga-
 nized into strong, independent trade unions. The right to form
 and belong to trade unions is constitutionally guaranteed, and
 unions are among the most active organizations in the country.
 The two major unions are each associated with one of the two
 major political parties. They operate as independent organiza-
 tions, however, and differ at times with their respective
 political movements. Unions participate extensively in labor-
 related policy decisions and make active use of the bargaining
 rights guaranteed in the Labor Relations and Industrial
 Disputes Act of 1975. Jamaican workers, including government
 employees, frequently exercise their right to strike. Unions
 are affiliated with regional and international labor bodies.
 Jamaican unions have contributed many leaders to the political
 process. Among these are the current Deputy Prime Minister/
 Minister of Foreign Affairs and two former Prime Ministers.
 
 
 620
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Freedom of religion is guaranteed in the Constitution and has
 long been established in Jamaica. A great variety of religious
 groups, including several African and animistic religions and
 cults, operate freely. More than 80 percent of the population
 professes one Christian denomination or another. The
 Government does not restrict religious practices and membership
 in a particular religious group confers no advantage. In
 October 1983 the Christian Conscience Movement and Save Your
 Nation Crusade in Jamaica protested the celebrations of some of
 the African cults which took place on the grounds of the Prime.
 Minister's office complex, but the Prime Minister said these
 events encouraged the traditional African-based cultvre of
 Jamaica. He declared his staunch support for religious
 tolerance.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel,
 Emigration, and Repatriation
 The Constitution guarantees Jamaican citizens freedom of move-
 ment throughout the country, the right to reside in any part of
 it, the right to enter, and immunity from expulsion. There are
 no national restrictions on foreign travel or emigration.
 Citizenship is not revoked for political reasons.
 In recent years individuals from Cuba, Haiti, and Nicaragua
 have sought to settle and work in Jamaica, claiming to be
 .refugees." Haitians are considered economic migrants, and
 most are returned to Haiti. In 1983 several Nicaraguan refu-
 gees were returned to Colombia, the country where they first
 sought refuge, and others still await determination of their
 status. Cuban migrants have not been returned to Cuba by the
 current government; some have been accepted by the U.S. and
 Canada for resettlement, and some still reside in a military
 camp in Kingston awaiting a decision on their resettlement.
 Jamaica's reasons for not accepting migrants are largely
 economic ones and include high domestic unemployment.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to
 Change Their Government
 The Jamaica Labor Party came into power in November 1980 when
 it won the majority of seats in the House of Representatives.
 The Prime Minister and his cabinet take the initiative in
 legislative matters and are responsible to the House of Repre-
 sentatives. Although Jamaica has a multi-party political
 system, there are two main parties which have regularly alter-
 nated in power. The position of the Leader of the Opposition
 is provided for in the Constitution.
 Opposition groups, including Communist parties, operate freely,
 and no group is denied participation in the political process.
 The political system does not exclude any ethnic groups nor
 women. There are no restrictions on nationality or citizenship
 status which limit participation in political life. All citi-
 zens 18 years of age and over are eligible to vote.
 In August 1983, a process of voter registration with photo-
 graphs was begun throughout the island, in order to bring
 voting lists up to date and protect the electoral process from
 
 
 621
 fraud. However, this process was not completed when elections
 vere called for December 1983, which caused the People's
 National Party to boycott the election. As a result of the
 boycott and the failure of any of the seven third party candi-
 dates to be elected to the house, there is currently no offi-
 cial leader of the opposition.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 There has been little interest in international or nongovern-
 mental groups in investigating human rights in Jamaica.
 Freedom House in 1983 rated Jamaica as "free." Amnesty
 International expressed concern in its 1983 report over the use
 of the death penalty in 1982.
 There are no restrictions on human rights organizations,
 several of which exist within the country. The Jamaica Council
 for Human Rights is the most active domestic human rights orga-
 nization. It is primarily concerned with submission of peti-
 tions for mercy to the Governor-General and to the Privy
 Council on behalf on convicts sentenced to death. In 1983 the
 Council also spoke out about the large number of killings by
 the police, and demanded a public inquiry into such deaths. In
 October 1983 after the coup in Grenada, the Council cabled
 General Austin requesting information on certain individuals
 and medical care for one of them.
 Jamaica is a member of several international bodies which
 protect human rights. The country is also a strong advocate of
 human rights in international fora, such as CARICOM and the
 UN. Jamaican leaders, including the present Prime Minister,
 have spoken before regional and other international bodies on
 behalf of human rights. A Jamaican is a judge on the Inter-
 American Court of Human Rights.
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 Jamaica's economy has recently suffered from a sharp decline in
 production of bauxite/alumina, its major foreign exchange
 earner. Overall growth for 1983/84 is expected to be nega-
 tive. Both inflation and unemployment have risen. Reduced
 foreign exchange and domestic budgets have left Jamaica with
 fewer resources to deal with pressing economic and social
 programs. The Government has given priority to maintaining the
 inflows of raw materials and capital goods needed to support
 Jamaica's private sector-oriented recovery program. While the
 development budget and consumer imports have been cut, the
 Government is trying to limit the impact of these stringent
 measures on the consumption of basic commodities by the poor.
 Jamaica has a per capita Gross National Product of $1,182;
 there are, however, wide disparities in income levels. Unem-
 ployment among prime-age men is under 10 percent, while that
 for women is near 40 percent and that for teenagers is over 30
 percent. The Government is seeking to reduce these disparities
 through a major agriculture program designed to increase
 production and employment in rural areas, job training programs
 for youth, and programs to assist individuals in starting their
 own businesses.
 Functional literacy in Jamaica is over 60 percent, and there is
 nearly universal primary school enrollment. Jamaica's educa-
 tion system is free, but the rising cost of living has placed a
 
 
 622
 financial strain on families who must provide school books and
 uniforms. The Seaga Government is improving rural health
 services which are inadequate, even though Jamaica's overall
 life expectancy at birth is 70.9 years, and the infant
 mortality is 16 per 1000 live births. The average annual rate
 of population increase is 1.5 percent.
 Women constitute 46.7 percent of the island's labor force as of
 April 1982. They have equal rights under Jamaican law, but in
 practice they continue to suffer economic discrimination, such
 as lower pay, a cultural bias toward traditional female occupa-
 tions, and more difficult access to better jobs. The 1975
 Employment Act states that men and women should receive equal
 pay for equal work. The Act is honored in the civil service
 and in larger private establishments. Discrimination against
 women occurs, however, in hiring practices, as reflected in
 high unemploymnt rate for women. There are, however, a number
 of women in high-level positions in private enterprise and
 public service including that of Minister of Education. Some
 of the most dynamic politicians and civil servants in Jamaica
 are women. The Jamaican government established a women's
 bureau within the Ministry of Youth and Community Development
 in 1974 to formulate policy and design programs to cope with
 problems faced by women. The bureau runs programs to train
 women in agricultural and technical skills as well as-a
 training center for pregnant girls. The bureau has been
 largely responsible for legislation granting maternity leave to
 pregnant workers and legal status to children born out of
 wedlock.
 Jamaica is a multi-racial society. No ethnic group has been
 subjected to systematic discrimination.
 Increasing crime and violence have been major social problems
 in Jamaica in recent decades. Rising unemployment, urbaniza-
 tion, lessened respect for authority and the police force,
 over-worked courts, and the consequent pressures on the
 security forces have contributed to the growing crime rate.
 The response of successive Jamaican governments has been to
 pass the Gun Court and Suppression of Crime acts and to give
 high priority to crime fighting efforts by the security forces.
