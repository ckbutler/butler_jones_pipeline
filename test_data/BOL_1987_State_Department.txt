 BOLIVIA
 Bolivia is a multiparty democracy with an elected government.
 The -ffee;elections -held'on July -14, -1985, represented the',
 first constitutional transition from one civilian government
 to another in almost 20 years. Neither of the two leading
 candidates received an absolute majority, and the Bolivian
 Congress selected Dr. Victor Paz Estenssoro to be President,
 in accordance with procedures outlined ih the Constitution.
 Paz Estenssoro took office on. August 6, 1985.'
 President Paz Estenssoro's austere economic program, 'one of
 the most far-reaching in Latin America, succeeded in ending
 hyperinf-lation and stabilizing, the economy. Nevertheless,
 Bolivia remains the second poorest country in tie Western
 Hemisphere, and its economy rose only slightly in 1987 after
 declining for.5 consecutive years. Although reasonably rich
 in natural resources, high production costs and low prices in
 the mining sector led to large-scale layoffs and significantly
 raised thenation's unemployment rate, which exbeedea 20"
 percent by.-the end of 1987. The growing number-of displaced
 workers ;represents one of the country's most pressing problems.
 The Paz.Administretion's strict adherence to stringent'economic
 reforms is strongly opposed-by organized labor'- Petroluin
 work'rs  ad teachers, unions each staged lengthy strikes in
 198,-De pite occasional violent demonstrations, the
 Goverhment succeeded in maintainihg public order without
 imposihg-a state of siege.  ï¿½                   -,
 The Government has undertaken an extensive antinarcotics
 campsign. During 1987 Bolivia continued interdicti6n
 operatigns: inaugurated in the prdceding year ahd began
 eradicating'Coca plant  in September. While the antinarcotics
 prog.ram. has met with considerable criticism'and resistance, -
 partniculaxly from peasant farmers, over 2,500 acres of coca
 had been eradicated'by-the end of the-year.
 Human rights are provided for in'the Constitutional and
 generally respected in Bolivia. However, the violence and
 corruption associated with'narcotics trafficking have
 seriously affected, the administration of'justice in Bolivia.
 In late 1986, Noel Kempff, a Bolivian natuklist; and" - -
 CongressmanEdmundoSalazar-were assassinated, presumably by
 drug traffickers. In-May 1987 roadblocks by peasants'and
 miners, allegedly organized by traffickers to protest
 legislation that would categorize coca producers as drug
 traffickers, resulted in several deaths as police attempted to
 clear the roads. Later in the year, two-policemen were
 implicatediin the deaths of.tWd children at a detention center
 run by the Nati~nal.Police for drug violators in Chimore. The'"
 chil-drenzwere allegedly murdered by local police who had been'
 forcing them to eradicate coca plants.    ' "
 Although the Government has attempted to clean up the corrupt
 judicial system and bring to justice'those responsible for the
 Kempff and-Salazar murders, suspects in the Kempff case were
 released- 'The Attorney General ordered that a judge be tried
 for "betrayal of trust" for releasing the suspect. The
 Chamber of Deputies' Justice Committee, which-reviewed illicit
 drug activ.ities,- recommended that Congress indict a former
 Interior Minister on narcotics-related charges.

 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There were no political killings in 1987; however, several
 people died during civil and labor-related disturbances.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reports of politically motivated disappearance
 in Bolivia in 1987.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 The Constitution prohibits all forms of torture, and the
 Government neither condones nor practices such activity.
 Nevertheless, there are occasional charges of cruelty and
 degrading treatment. Two minors died in a detention center
 run by the National Police for drug violators in Chimore.
 Witnesses indicated that police had beaten one youth 60 to 70
 times with a club before forcing him to chop down coca plants.
 When he collapsed, an officer reportedly kicked him to death.
 There is no indication that the officer was court-martialed or
 otherwise disciplined.
 A second youth died under suspicious circumstances after more
 than 2 months at the center. Officials provided a variety of
 explanations for this death, including chills, epilepsy,
 intoxication, and asphyxiation from swallowing a wad of chewed
 coca leaves. Although the cause of death was never determined,
 bruises on his face led some to believe that he was
 deliberately suffocated. Former inmates at the detention
 center stated that temporary suffocation was a common form of
 punishment there.
 Most problems of prisoner mistreatment are'caused by
 underpaid, undertrained prison and police personnel.
 Corruption, malnutrition, and unsanitary conditions are
 endemic in Bolivia's underfinanced prison system.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, Exile, or Forced Labor
 Under the Constitution, no one can be arrested without a court
 order, and detainees must be charged or released within 24
 hours. The Constitution provides for a judicial determination
 of whether or not a detention is legal. Prisoners are usually
 released if a judge rules that they have been detained
 illegally. After the initial detention, prisoners may consult
 a lawyer of their choice. Provisions for bail exist in
 Bolivia, and bail is generally granted. The Constitution
 provides that under a state of siege authorities may detain
 persons for up to 48 hours before issuing an arrest order.
 Although the Government did not declare a state of siege, it
 did detain numerous labor leaders in July after petroleum
 workers announced plans to strike and threatened to damage
 petroleum installations. The Government announced several
 days later that it had released the leaders after they asked
 to return to their jobs. Some newspaper accounts reported,
 however, that, rather than releasing the petroleum union's two
 principal leaders, the Government transported them under guard
 
 
 393
 BOLIVIA
 to 'Santa'Cruz to-negotiate an end to the'strike. Following
 the strike settlement, the- Government-released all detainees;
 none were charged bi tried." -               "
 The Petmantent Assembly on Human Rights, a"nongovernmental
 human rights watchdog organization, asserted in mid-October
 that the National Police were illegally holding 21 youths at
 an 'alcohol rehabilitation center in the South Yungas area of
 La Paz Department. The detainees, labeled delinquents by
 police, reportedly were detained without due process.
 Following a visit to the center, the Permanent Assembly also
 cited 4insanitary conditions at the-facility. The Permanent
 Assembly submitted a full report of its findings to the
 Government, but asserted that'cbnditibns at the center
 remained unchanged at the end of 1987.'
 Bolivian law p'fohibits forced or compulsory labor,-and neither
 has been reported.              .
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The Gogernment -uholds'the constitut'ional right -f fair public
 tr-i-a, but del-ays in the' judiciai Ksyste'mare common. A
 Supreme Court' justite stated that 'Bolivia had only 320 judges
 to handle a'bcklftof 60,000 to'70,000 cases. --belays in the
 investibations, t'ril s,-:and appeals procedures &re so- lengthy
 that some pr'sbfers eventually strve moYe tike than the

 witnedgeti to pfesnt' eividnhe and to "appea- 'a judicial
 decision. Thes6'rights gederally -ate upheld 'in practice.
 Although the law provides for a court-appoihted defense
 attorney t"'public 'expense, if necessary, -ne may not always'
 be provided,because of'a Ihortagfe of funds and qualified .- ,
 personnel. The quality of legal representation varies-widely
 as the profession is not well regulated, and no attorney has
 ever been"'disciplined.' The-Cohs'tutibn authories -the'--
 Suprbrm Court, -Bolivia'-highebt civilian judicial body, to
 review legslative meaures to determine if they are in
 accordance with a citizen's "concrete rights or the
 Constitution."
 Bolivia has both civilian and military judicial systems. The
 mil-itary Government of 1976 revised"the Military Penal Code
 and established the military c6urttsystem. The law defined
 and -established military'jurisdittion over actibhs against the
 security of the State, military personnel, and property.
 Corruptioh of the judicial system remains a seribus problem,
 as narcotics traffickers'routinely bribd-judges in exchange
 for releasing suspbcted traffickers; returning captured drugs,
 and purging incriminating files. 'The Go'vrnment bas'taken
 several-steps to clean'up Bolivia's judicial system, however.
 In a significant first step, a major trafficker was sentenced
 in absentia by a Santa Cruz judge in December-. -Dr-iffi  the
 same month, key members of a major trafficking organization
 werearrested and remained 'in custody in La Paz, despite
 apparent trafficker pressure for'their-release. Earlier, the
 President asked the Senate to suspend-all- judges in the penal.
 Chambers of the Superior Court of La Paz and"the district
 courts in Santa Cruz, Cochabamba, and Oruro who are accused of
 "betrayal of trust" or other crimes. Some 36 judges are
 currently under investigation.- The Governmbnt recently
 appointed -special prosecutors to work with narcotics police in
 drug cases and has proposed the creation of special narcotics
 
 
 394
 BOLIVIA
 tribunals. The Government also plans to establish a new code
 of conduct for police which will provide for 4- or 5-day
 summary disciplinary hearings for police suspected of
 corruption to replace the lengthy procedures now in force.
 Passage of the new code awaited Congressional action at the
 end of the year.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The sanctity of the home and the privacy of citizens' lives
 are protected by the Constitution and normally are respected
 in practice. Illegal house searches, monitoring of
 conversations, and other abuses that occurred under former
 military regimes have ceased.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 By law, citizens enjoy freedom of speech and exercise it
 widely without government interference. Both state-owned and
 private radio and television stations operate in Bolivia. All
 newspapers are privately owned. Since the restoration of
 democracy in 1982, Bolivians have enjoyed a generally
 unrestricted press representing a wide spectrum of political
 views. The Paz Estenssoro Government has tolerated full
 criticism from the media, although it has constitutional
 authority to impose censorship. In March, during labor
 unrest, a group of unidentified persons broke into a miners*
 radio station in San Jose, and removed its broadcasting
 equipment. The station had been airing broadcasts by
 protesting miners, and workers accused the Government of the
 attack. However, government involvement has not been
 established.
 A previously unknown leftist guerrilla group, the Commando
 Alejo Calatayud, claimed credit for bombing the offices of the
 Cochabamba newspaper Opinion in June. The attack caused minor
 damage but no injuries.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The rights of peaceful assembly and association were generally
 respected in 1987. The law provides that, under a state of
 siege, the Government may impose curfews and prohibit public
 demonstrations, but-none was declared in 1987.
 Bolivian workers have the right to organize and bargain
 collectively. The law does not extend this right to
 government workers, but the distinction is ignored in
 practice, as virtually all government workers are unionized.
 Government-employed teachers and petroleum workers conducted
 lengthy, generally peaceful strikes for higher wages and
 improved benefits in 1987.
 The Bolivian Workers Central (COB), an umbrella labor
 organization which represents the majority of workers, is
 independent and politically powerful. In the past it has
 frequently paralyzed the economy with crippling strikes.
 Antigovernment civil and labor demonstrations occasionally
 result in violence between demonstrators and police and
 military personnel attempting to limit strike disruptions.
 Several people died as a result of civil and labor-related

 disturlSandes in 1987. A farmer 'and a soldier were killed irk
 May when police -'and military units f6rcibly broke up-

 *c. 'Fi~edoiif of- Religion'.
 The Constitution 'recognizes Romnan Chtholicism as the country's
 official -Tlio.gib. "Catholic',shops redelve' norhinal stipend.
 from the State, but no 6ther secular advantage is conferred.
 Although Catholicism predominates in Bolivia, several hundred
 religibfis 'gro'ps-oberat'e openly an[ freely. ,In 1982 a
 Pr6test~int cbllege opened in Santa 'Cruz. "Tw'o" years' later, -a
 Bahal' university bpeAed in'the same city?. 'The Moxrron"'
 Baha'is, Seventh-Day Advefitist's, Methodists and others freely
 proselytize'and operate ch'irches and training centers
 throughout the country. The small Jewish community has not
 repakrted any discrimination or unfair treatment. The
 Mennonites have lar@e rural colonies in the department.of
 Santa Cruz. "The'GoVernment does hot persecute clergy for
 their religious beliefs, and citizens are generally free to
 practice the religion of their choice."
 The Government-has, however, issued new rules to regulate
 religious-'activity in the country; Under these'rules Roman
 Catholicism remains the state religion' and the Catholic
 Church ils designated to coordinate all public ceremonies in
 which governmental authorities and institutions participate.
 In addition, the rules provide that "religi6us institutions
 must solicit special permission to hold'public meetings or to
 broadcast on radio or television." Also, in implementing
 these rules, th6 Government'declared all existing religious
 registrations null and void, aid required religious groups to
 reregister. Some Evangelical Protestant groups have complained
 that they have been subjected to more stringent registration
 requirements than the Cath6lic Church, and that some have not
 
 
 396
 BOLIVIA
 been able to obtain their new registration authorization from
 the Government. In addition, some non-Catholic groups have
 indicated that the Government has used the new rules to
 restrict their broadcasts and other activities.
 The Government'announced in June that numerous sects were
 operating illegally and warned that the police would conduct
 searches of their facilities. Some foreign members of the
 Hari Krishna sect were expelled in 1987.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 There are no travel restrictions within Bolivia or abroad.
 The Government does not restrict emigration and guarantees
 departing citizens the right to return. Citizenship is not
 revoked for political reasons. Many Bolivians who either fled
 the country or were exiled for political reasons during the
 tumultuous 1978-82 period returned with the restoration of
 democracy and have enjoyed full freedom without harassment.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Bolivia is a multiparty democracy with an elected president
 and a functioning, independent bicameral legislature. The
 Government does not oppress opposition groups, which exist
 both in and out of the Congress.
 A May 1986 change in the electoral law requires a national
 identity card or a certificate of military service to register
 to vote. The fee imposed to issue the requisite national
 identity card could be considered an impediment to the basic
 right to vote. Early in the year, the President requested
 that Congress temporarily suspend this requirement. While the
 Government seeks ways in which to eliminate or defray the cost
 of a national identity card, the President proposed that any
 one of several current identification documents be acceptable
 for registration to allow greater voter participation.
 Charges of preelection fraud in La Paz Department marred the
 period leading up to the December municipal elections. The
 Nationalist Democratic Action party (ADN) and the Nationalist
 Revolutionary Movement (MNR) were accused of falsifying and
 tampering with voter registries. However, the.December 6
 municipal elections, the first to be held in almost 40 years,
 were deemed by observers to have been honest, with none of the
 major parties complaining of significant irregularities. The
 elections were peaceful, with no violent incidents reported.
 People of European or mixed-race origin are predominant in the
 political system. Indians speaking Aymara or Quechua as a
 mother tongue make.up an estimated 60 percent of the population
 but, with a few notable exceptions, they generally do not
 occupy leadership positions.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government is sensitive to the opinions of both
 international and domestic organizations regarding alleged
 violations of civil liberties. The Congress has committees
 responsible for monitoring human rights. The Government is
 willing to discuss human rights concerns with nongovernmental
 
 
 BOLIVIA
 organizations. The Catholic Church, the Permanent Assembly of
 Human Rights in Bolivia, and the press generally have been the
 most aggressive monitors of human rights.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Although protected in theory by social legislation which some
 Bolivians have charactprized as progressive, Bolivian women do
 not enjoy a'statys in society equal to that of men. Cultural
 traditions, *ocial conditions, and lack of political influence
 remlin thie major obstacles to advancement. In rural families,
 womexdoitribute significantly to economic activities and
 often control the family purse strings, but nonetheless are
 considered socially subordinate. In urban settings, women are
 slowly achieving a greater role in business and professional
 life. Their participation in cooperatives, community affairs,
 and ed4eion is* incieasing.
 Since  he 1952 Revolution, the Constitution has banned social
 discriminz1ation.' But discrimination by Bolivians of mixed
 Europea 'origin agains-t people of Indian background continues.
 At leasi; partially, as a r.esult of this treatment, the Indian
 majority of.the population remains at the lower end of the
 country's socioeconomic scale and is disadvantaged in terms of
 health, life expectancy, education, income, and employment.
 CONDITiONS OF LAPdR
 Bolivian laj pr awaprohibits aqy labor contract which denies-a
 worker's onstitd)_ional rights ani freedoms. Women and minors
 underl8y.ais .of age may noq'engage in dangerous, unhealthy,
 or immo al woC. 'No other iestriction on employment of minors
 exists." B6'ifvia-s labor'laws cbntain7 conditions, for child
 pro~ectlon, paid vacati hs," api protection of workers' health
 and safety. In practice these laws are not rigorously
 observed, and the Government has not provided funds for
 adequate enforcement.. The mines,.often oid and operated with
 antiquated 'quipment,* are partirulrjy dangerous and unhealthy.
 Many'mi09 workers suffer ;from siicosis..  .
 The PerManent Assembly on Human fights has expres'sed concern
 that growfig unemployment, is cortributi g' to a worsening of
 living conditions. Bolivia has a minimum wage law as well, as
 an elaborat.e system 6f bonuses and compensations for the
 private sectot. ,Powever ,a single mini'm wage earner cannot-  -
 easily supiobrt a family at an acceptable standaid of living (a
 cofitinihg complaint of union leaders). "Most.urban siorkers
 (about half the labor force) observe an 8-hour day and a 5- or
 5 1/2--ay workweek.
