 LATVIA
 Latvia is a parliamentard democracy, having regained its independence in 1991
 after forced annexation and more than 50 years of occupation by the Soviet Union.
 Elections for the 100-seat Parliament (Saeima) held in the fall of 1995 and for mu-
 nicipal council elections in March were free and fair, but the election law barred
 some citizens from competing due to prior activity in pro-Soviet organizations or
 lack of fluency in the state language. The Prime Minister, as chief executive, and
 the Cabinet are responsible for government operations. The President, as Head of
 
 
 1160
 State, is elected by the Parliament. The Saeima reelected President Guntis Ulmanis
 in a competitive election in June 1996. The 1991 Constitutional Law which supple-
 ments Latvia's 1922 Constitution provides for basic rights and freedoms. (The
 Saeima, however, has not yet finaized the second portion of the Constitution itself
 which includes guarantees of human rights.) The judiciary is independent but not
 well-trained, efficient, or free from corruption.
 The security apparatus consists of: The national police and other services, such
 as the Special Immigration Police, subordinate to the Ministry of Interior, municipal
 police operating under local government control; the Counterintelligence Service and
 a protective service operating under the Ministry of Defense; and the National
 Guard, an element of the national armed forces, which also assists in police activi-
 ties. Effective January 1, the Border Guard Force was transferred from the Ministry
 of Defense to the Ministry of Interior. Civilian authorities generally maintain effec-
 tive control of the security forces and the Constitution Protection Bureau (SAB) is
 responsible for coordinating intelligence activities. However, Interior Ministry
 forces, municipal police, and intelligence personnel sometimes acted independently
 of central government authority. Some members of the security forces, including po-
 lice and other Interior Ministry personnel, committed human rights abuses.
 Traditionally dominated by agriculture and forestry products, with military and
 other industrial production introduced by the Soviets, the varied economy is increas-
 ingly oriented toward the service sector. As the transition from a centrally planned
 to a market-oriented economic system continues, private enterprise in trade and
 services is thriving. About 80 percent of agricultural land is farmed privately, and
 60 percent of all land is now in private hands. In the industrial sector, progress to-
 ward privatization and revitalization is much slower. The currency remained stable
 and freely traded, unemployment was 7.3 percent, and annual inflation was 7.7 per-
 cent, down from 15 percent in 1996. Per capita gross domestic product (GDP) was
 slightly over $2,016. GDP continued the rise begun in 1996.
 The Government generally respected the human rights of its citizens and the
 large resident noncitizen community, although problems remained in certain areas.
 Members of the security forces, including the police and other Interior Ministry per-
 sonnel, continued to use excessive force; police and prison officers beat detainees
 and inmates. The Government did not take adequate disciplinary action against
 those responsible. Prison conditions remained poor. The inefficient judiciary did not
 always ensure the fair administration of justice. Although the Citizen and Immigra-
 tion Department (CID) remained bureaucratic and slow in dealing with issues con-
 cerning noncitizens, independent observers stated that the previous year's improved
 performance continued, The Prosecutor General formally protested the light sen-
 tence handed down in June to an alleged local Mafia boss-a case that also high-
 lighted the current lack of an effective witness protection program. Thirty-three
 aliens remain in detention in Latvia without trial or final determination of their sta-
 tus. Women are discriminated against in the workplace. Spousal abuse and traffick-
 ing in women, as well as child prostitution and abuse, are significant problems.
 Among key positive developments were the Saeima's ratification in June of the
 1950 European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental
 Freedoms- and its passage in July of the 1951 U.N. Convention Relating to the Sta-
 tus of Refugees. The Government plans to develop a new refugee reception center
 at Mucinieki, on the outskirts of Riga. In September, the Government signed the
 Council of Europe's Convention Against Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treat-
 ment or Punishment. The National Human Rights Office (NHRO) continues to func-
 tion independently and to achieve greater recognition from the public.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-In December unknown assailants
 shot and killed Janis Riba, the leader of the ultranationalist group, Aizargi. Riba's
 followers claim that the killing was politically motivated; others speculate that ri-
 vais within the ultranationalist movement committed the murder. A police inves-
 tigation is still underway.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution prohibits torture. However, there were credible reports that plice
 and prison personnel beat prison inmates as well as asylum seekers at the elaine
 Detention Center, as well as other detainees in other facilities. Some law enforce-
 ment personnel were prosecuted for use of excessive force in handling prisoners. A
 municipal policeman Janis Senbergs, an ethnic Latvian, was sentenced to 5 years'
 imprisonment for involuntary manslaughter after he beat Maksim Ermolayev, a 16-
 
 
 1161
 
 year-old ethnic Russian who later died of his injuries. After the highly publicized
 hazing incidents of 1996, military authorities took steps to curb the practice. There
 were no confirmed reports of hazing during the year.
 Prison conditions remained poor, despite new construction and foreign assistance,
 that has facilitated some improvements. Inadequate sanitation facilities, persistent
 shortages of blankets and medical care, and insufficient lighting and ventilation are
 common problems, as is the shortage of resources in general. Detainees complain
 that they are subject to physical and psychological intimidation by prison guards.
 Latvia's worst faciity, built in the first decade of the 20th century, had undergone
 no renovations until 1996. In the unrenovated portion of the facility, more than 40
 prisoners are housed in a single cell with one open toilet; sink conditions are sub-
 stantially better in renovated portions of the facility. The Government has stated
 its intention to continue renovations as rapidly as its limited finances allow. Min-
 istry of the Interior personnel stated that prisoners accused of crimes spend an av-
 erageofyear in this facility before trial, but many have been there much longer.
 The NHROcontinues to criticize the failure of many prison facilities to meet mni-
 mum international standards and in particular the fact that medical personnel are
 not sufficiently independent of the prison administration. Throughout the year, the
 NHRO organized human rights training programs for prison authorities and person-
 neL.
 Detention facilities for asylum seekers are substandard (see Section 2.d.)
 The situation for some imprisoned children, who are not always separated from
 adults, remained poor. Children as young as 14 years of age were kept in unsanitary
 conditions, and suffer from disease and deprivation. Both boys and girls are subject
 to violence and possible sexual abuse.
 In December a delegation of foreign ambassadors visited Latvia's worst prison at
 the invitatioii of the Minister of the Interior.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-There were no known instances of arbi-
 trary arrest. The responsibility for issuing arrest warrants was transferred from
 prosecutors to the courts in 1994. The law requires the prosecutor's office to make
 a formal decision whether to charge or release a detainee within 72 hours after ar-
 rest. Charges must be filed within 10 days of arrest. No detainee may be held for
 more than 18 months without the prosecutor presenting the case to the defendant
 and the court. Detainees have the right to have an attorney present at any time.
 These rights are subject to judicial review but only at the time of trial. There were
 credible reports that these rights are not always respected in practice, especially
 outside Riga.
 There were no reports of forced exile, which is prohibited by law.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution provides for an independent judi-
 ciary, and the Government generally respects this provision in practice. However,
 the courts must rely on the Ministry of Justice for administrative support, and the
 judiciary is not well trained, efficient, or free from corruption.
 The Supreme Court does not have a clearly established right to rule on the con-
 stitutionality of legislation or its conformity with the countrs international obliga-
 tions. In June the Parliament amended the Constitution and adopted legislation to
 establish a Constitutional Court to fulfill these functions. The new seven-judge
 panel is authorized to hear cases at the request of state institutions (the President,
 Cabinet, prosecutor, Supreme Court, local governments, or one-third of Saeima
 members) but not of individuals or courts. A project is currently underway to ex-
 pand the jurisdiction of the Constitutional Court to include referrals from lower
 courts. The Parliament approved six of the judges to sit on the court, which held
 its first organizational meeting and elected an acting chairman in December.
 The Government continues to reform the judicial system. In 1995 it completed the
 establishment of regional courts to hear appeals of lower court decisions. For more
 serious criminal cases, two lay assessors join the professional judge on the bench.
 Corruption in the judicial system is reportedly widespread. In November the judges
 appointed to preside over the trial of the President of the collapsed Bank Baltija,
 Oscar Lavent, resigned from the case, citing alleged political pressure from the Gov-
 ernment. The accusation came after the judges released Lavent to house arrest fol-
 lowing a heart attack that he suffered in the courtroom on the first day of the trial.
 In March the country's leading newspaper reported that, according to a recent socio-
 logical survey, most residents do not trust the courts. Most judges have inadequate
 udicial training, and the court system is too weak to enforce many of its decisions.
 In June the Prosecutor General harshly criticized the light sentence handed down
 to alleged Mafia boss Ivan Haritnov, and appealed the decision. (The case also
 highlighted the absence of an effective witness protection program.) A major dif-
 ficulty in enforcing court decisions is the lack of an effective bailiff or sheriff system.
 There is a lack of information available on which to make informed decisions, espe-
 
 
 1162
 ily outside Riga. Court cases are not published systematically, nor is there a cen-
 tralized index for those that are published. Trials may be closed if state secrets
 might be revealed or to protect the interests of minors. All defendants have the
 right to hire an attorney, and the State will lend funds to destitute defendants for
 this purpose. Defendants have the right to read all charges, confront all witnesses,
 and may offer witnesses and evidence to support their case. They may also make
 multiple appeals of adverse verdicts.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 Former Latvian Commumst Party First Secretary Afreds Rubiks, whose support-
 er considered him a political prisoner, was released from jail in December after
 serving 6 years of an 8-year sentence for plotting to ovehrow the Government.
 Under the law a court can, on the recommendaton of prison authorities, release
 persons on grounds of good behavior who have served three-quarters of their sen-
 tence.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The law
 requires that law enforcement authoties have a judicial warrant in order to inter-
 cpt citizens' mail, telephone calls, or other forms of communication. This protection
 is less comprehensive for the large noncitizen population. There were no reports of
 the unsanctioned taping of the telephone conversations of public officials, such as
 came to light in 1996.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitutional Law provides for freedom of
 ech and the press, and the Government generally respects this right in practice.
 Te1991 Press Law prohibits censorship of the press or other mass media. Most
 newspapers and magazines are privately owned. New publications continued to ap-
 pear, but eonomic difficulties forced others to close. Newspapers in'bth Latvian
 and russian published a wide range of criticism and political viewpoints.
 A large number of independent television and radio outlets broadcast in beth Rus-
 sian and Latvian, and the number of people receiving satellite television broadcasts
 continued to increase.
 The Law on Radio and Television contains a number of restrictive prvisions regu-
 lating the content and language of broadcasts. No more than 30 percent of private
 broadcasts ma be in languages other than Latvian; in prime time, 40 percent of
 television broadcasts must be of Latvian and 80 percent of European origin. How-
 ever, these previsions are not always implemented. In addition foreign investment
 may not exceed 20 percent of the capital in electronic media organizations.
 There are no restrictions on academic freedoa.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The authorities legally may
 not prohibit public gatherings. Organizers of demonstrations must provide advance
 notice to local authorities, who may change the time and place of public gatherings
 for such reasons as fear of public disorder. Numerous public meetings and political
 demonstrations took place without government interference. In January the Seima
 passed legislation on public demonstrations and that requires protesters to remain
 specified distances from foreign missions, the Saeima, the Prosecutor's office, and
 certain other public institutions. While the law purports to imitate Western Euro-
 pean statutes, independent human rights organizations in Latvia find its previsions
 contradictory and confusing.           a
 The Constitution provides for the right to associate in public organizations. How-
 ever, the Law on Registering Public Organizations was amended in late 1993 to bar
 registration of Communist, Nazi, or other organizations whose activities would con-
 travene the Constitution. More than 35 pAoitical pTies are officially registered.
 Noncitizens are prohibited from forming political organizations.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitutional Law provides for freedom of religion,
 and the Goveroment generally respects this right in practice. Although the Govern-
 ment does not require the registration of religious groups, the 1995 Law on Reli-
 gious Organizsation  specestatious      anizations can enjoys certain rights
 and privileges only if they register. Under this law the Justice inistry has reg-
 istered over 800 religious congregations, including Mormons, whose previous lack of
 official registration had created difficulties in obtainingvisas and residence status.
 According to the Ministry of Justice's Department of Religious fairs, the church
 groups denied registration to date include Jehovah's Witnesses, the Latvian Free
 Orthodox Church, the Church of Christ Scientist, and the Rock of Salvation Church.
 Although Jehovah's Witnesses withdrew their court challenge to this decision, they
 continue to press for registration as a religion. Foreign evangelists and missionaries
 are permitted to hold meetings and to proselytize, but the law stipulates that only
 religious organizations in Latvia may invite them to carry out such activities. For-
 eign religious denominations have criticized this provision.
 
 
 1163
 The denial of registration to Jehovah's Witnesses imposes real hardships and has
 resulted in the general perception among both the public and many government offi-
 cials that Jehovah's Witnesses is an illega gup. Despite the number of adherents
 in Latvia, as an organization, Jehovah s Witnesses is denied the necessary legal
 means to administer to the spiritual needs of its members.
 In July the Parliament adopted amendments to the Law on Religious Organiza-
 tions, one of which stipulated that religious education may be provided to students
 in public schools on a voluntary basis only by representatives of Evangelical Lu-
 theran, Roman Catholic, Old Believer, Baptist, and Orthodox religious organiza-
 tions. Students at state-supported national minority schools may also receive edu-
 cation in the religion "characteristic of the national minority." Other denominations
 may provide religious education, but may not do so in state-funded schools. In July
 1996, the Parliament adopted amendments to the Law on Religious Organizations,
 one of which reduced the number of persons necessary to seek registration as a reli-
 gious organization from a minimum of 25 citizens to 10 persons residing perma-
 nently in Latvia. In June Parliament further amended this legislation to allow any
 citizens and permanent residents included in the Inhabitant's Register to register
 a religion. However, asylum seekers, foreign embassy staff, and those in the country
 temporarily or in special status still cannot register a religious organization.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-There are no obstacles to freedom of movement within the country, for-
 eign travel, or repatriation of citizens. Latvia has readmitted noncitizens who
 claimed refu ee status in a foreign country, or who voluntarily abandoned their per-
 manent residence, and then decided to return to Latvia to live and work. Nonciti-
 zens who left Latvia as refugees based on Soviet-era persecution have no difficulty
 returning on foreign refugee travel documents for business reasons or for family vis-
 its.
 The 1995 Law on the Status of Former Soviet Citizens stipulates that-registered
 permanent resident noncitizens enjoy the rights to establish and change residences,
 travel abroad, and return to the country. However, certain rights are denied to non-
 citizens. Although restrictions on holding jobs such as airline personnel and fire-
 fighters were lifted, noncitizens are still prohibited from working as private detec-
 tives, armed guards, or certified attorneys, and cannot yet hold licenses to pursue
 pharmaceutical activities. In addition, only citizens can be granted amnesty or hold
 posts in reigious ongregations. Noncitizens may own land, but only under com-
 picated restrictions. The law also provides for the issuance of new noncitizen travel
 documents verifying these rights. In April the Citizenship and Immigration Depart-
 ment (CaD) began issuing a new, more secure aliens passport to noncitizens. The
 Government also announced the gradual phase out of former Soviet external pass-
 ports. The validity of former Soviet external passports for departure from Latvia to
 all countries except the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) expired on De-
 cember 31, 1997. These documents remain valid for travel to the CIS-member coun-
 tries through December 31, 1998. Former Soviet external passports may be used to
 return to Latvia from all countries through December 31, 1998.
 Most of the asylum seekers formerly detained at the Olaine detention camp were
 accepted by Nordic countries late in 1996 on the assumption that in 1997 Latvia
 would adopt and implement refugee legislation in accordance with the 1951 United
 Nations (U.N.) Refugee Convention. In June Latvia acceded to the Convention Re-
 lating to the Status of Refugees done at Geneva in 1951, but, at the insistence of
 nationalist parties within the Saeima, with the stipulation that it apply only to refu-
 gees from European countries. Independant observers, such as the National Human
 Rights Office (NHRO), the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe
 (OSCE), United Nations Development Program (UNDP), Western embassies, as well
 as within the Government, immediately criticized the decision. In July the Cabinet
 announced it would introduce legislation requesting that the Saeima, on its return
 from summer recess in September, drop the provision. In September the Saeima
 ratified the 1951 U.N. Convention by reversing its original vote to restrict applica-
 tion of the treaty exclusively to refugees from European countries. As soon as the
 amendment passed, Sweden and Finland went forward with a visa-free travel agree-
 ments previously delayed pending the outcome of the Saeima vote.
 The elaine detention center for asylum seekers has serious shortcomings, and
 conditions there are substandard. The Government is developing a new refugee re-
 ception center that meets minimum international standards at Mucinieki, on the
 outskirts of Riga, with multilateral donor assistance. However, until Mucinieki is re-
 furbished, asylum seekers are to remain housed at the Olaine facility. A total of 33
 aliens remain in detention in the Olaine center without trial or final determination
 of their status.
 
 
 1164
 The Government works closely with the United Nations High Commissioner for
 Refugees (UNHCR). As of year's end, discussions were near completion between the
 UNHCR and the Ministry of Interior on an agreement for the UNHCR to supervise
 the reconstruction of the new refugee center at Mucinieki.
 The Government has charged the Interior and Justice Ministries with the complex
 task of implementing the terms of Latvia's accession to the Convention Relating to
 the Status of Refugees done at Geneva in 1951. Special immigration police and bor-
 der guards units are to help prescreen asylum requests. CID decisions can be ap-
 pealed to a new asylum appeals board, that is being established in the Ministry of
 Justice. By late summer, initial training for the personnel of these bodies was un-
 derway.
 The issue of provision of first asylum did not arise.
 Organized alien smuggling, frequently involving central and south Asians
 transiting Latvia from Russia and Belarus en route to Western Europe or the Unit-
 ed States has been detected. According to police sources, in 1996 more than 700 per-
 sons who were illegally in the country were involuntarily returned to their homes
 abroad, and another 524 voluntarily departed. During the first 6 months of 1997,
 almost 200 people who were illegally in Latvia were deported and another 173 vol-
 untarily left the country. Latvia has approached Russia and Belarus about conclud-
 hng refugee readinission agreements, the lack of which poses a major barrier to ef-
 fective control of the eastern border. Thirty-three aliens whose legal status is un-
 clear remain in detention at Olaine.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens have the right to change their government. There were free and fair elec-
 tions for Parliament (the Saeima) in 1995, with the participation of numerous par-
 ties and factions representing a broad political spectrum. Candidates from 11 par-
 ties won Saeima seats, and 72 percent of eligible voters participated. Free and fair
 elections for municipal government offices, in which nearly 56 percent of the elector-
 ate participated, took place in March in over 500 cities. However, the election law
 barred some citizens from voting in these elections due to prior activity in pro-Soviet
 organizations or lack of fluency in the state language.
 In Augst the Saeima's legal affairs committee considered, but did not approve
 lifting he ban on persons seeking elected office who had remained active in the
 Communist Party or various other pro-Soviet organizations after January 13, 1991.
 Under legislative procedures the provision, which is part of a much broader revision
 of the election law, was placed before the full Saeima for an initial review. In Octo-
 ber the full Saeima again defeated the provision. The popular mayor of Daugavpils,
 Aleksei Vidavskiy, had been charged in court with violating this provision, but was
 acquitted in February, a decision subsequently upheld in the Supreme Court in Au-
 gust. The Saeima, however, maintained the provision barring former KGB officers
 and Soviet collaborators from standing in elections. It also let stand provisions pre-
 venting noncitizen from voting in local elections At the end of the year, the legal
 affairs committee was preparing a final draft of the ban provision language for sub-
 mission to the full Saeima for a final vote.
 In June 1996 the Parliament fulfilled its constitutional responsibility to elect an
 individual to serve a 3-year term as President. The Saeima chose freely among four
 candidates in a secret ballot that resulted in the reelection of the incumbent Presi-
 dent.
 Following the restoration of independence in 1991, citizenship was immediately
 accorded only to those persons who were citizens of the independent Latvian Repub-
 lic in 1940 and their direct descendants. Owing to the Russification policy pursued
 during the Soviet era, ethnic Latvians constitute 56 percent of a total population
 of 2.5 million, and 78 percent of citizens. Ethnic Latvians do not constitute a major-
 ity in seven of the eight largest cities. Citizens of other ethnic origins number ap-
 proximately 400,000, of which almost 300,000 are Russian. There are about 687,000
 noncitizens, of which an estimated 65 percent are Russian, 12 percent are Belo-
 russian, 9 percent are Ukrainian; there are smaller percentages of Poles, Lithua-
 nians, Jews, Roma, Germans, Tatars, Estonians, and Armenians. After independ-
 ence the status of approximately 670,000 people changed from citizens of the Soviet
 Union to noncitizen residents in Latvia. More than 70 percent of the registered resi-
 dents are citizens, almost 400,000 of whom are not ethnic Latvian.
 Under provisions of a 1994 law, various categories of noncitizens become eligible
 to apply for naturalization over a period extending from 1995 until early in the next
 century. Highest priority was given to spouses of Latvian citizens, citizens of other
 Baltic states, and persons born in Latvia. The law includes a Latvian language and
 residence requirement as well as restrictions on naturalization of several groups in-
 
 
 1165
 cluding former Soviet intelligence and military officers. The law requires applicants
 for citizenship to renounce previous non-Latvian- citizenship, to have nowedge of
 the Constitution and Latvian history, and to take a loyalty oath.
 International observers, including the resident Organization of Security and Co-
 operation in Europe (OSCE) mission, credit the Government with establishing a
 competent and professional naturalization board with offices throughout the country
 to implement the 1994 law. In the estimation of the NHRO, the OSCE and various
 NGO athe Board has to date sought to apply the law fairly. However, the _pace of
 naturalization remains slow. According to statistics provided by the Naturalization
 Board, the number of people who sought to be naturalized in recent years was: in
 1995: eligible 60,000, applied 2,856; in 1996: eligible 33,000, applied 2,572; in 1997:
 eligible 31,000; applied 2,686. The reasons for this relatively small number may in-
 clude potential applicants' lack of confidence that they could meet language require-
 ments, the restricted category_ of applicants eligible to seek naturalization in the
 fir-st 2 years, ertain benefits that flow from noncitizen status (such as travel with-
 out visas to Russia and exemption from compulsoey military service), and a sense
 that the legal status of permanent resident noncitizens is relatively secure. Presi-
 dent Ulmanis has continued repeatediy and publicly to voice his concern about the
 slow pace of naturaization. 60e has suggested that the naturalization "windows"
 system (which permits successive age groups the right to apply for naturalization
 in a consecutive sequence and in a designated order) be reconsidered. It was also
 at his instigation that in December the Government passed regulations lowering the
 naturalization fee according to the economic circumstances of the applicant. Under
 the new fee schedule, pensioners and certain categories of students and the handi-
 capped will pay about $26 (15 lats) rather than about $52 (30 lats). Other categories
 of persons-victims of political repression, the severely disabled, orphans, and the
 indigent-are exempt from payment.
 In March the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) High
 _Commissioner for Minorities Max van der Stzel suggested easing the language and
 history sections of the naturalization test, and recommended that Latvia naturalize
 those children born in Latvia to resident aliens after Latvia's reestablishment of
 independence.
 Since its passage, there have been various attempts to amend the citizenship law.
 An amendment in 1995 granted automatic citizenship (as opposed to requiring natu-
 ralization) to ethnic Latvians returning to the country, as well as to persons who
 successfully complete their secondary education an a Latvian-language school. These
 amendments allowed several people to register as citizens. However  efforts by
 human rights eups and Saeima members to accord automatic citizenship to chil-
 dren born in Latvia since independence to non-Lan tvian permanent residents have
 so far been unsuccessful. In addtion, a proposal to grant citizenship automatically
 to ethnic Poles who are permanent residents was also rejected.
 International experts, government officials, and domestic human rights monitors
 agreed that Latvia must continue to place high priority and devote sufficient re-
 sources to implementing the citizenship law in a fair andimpartial manner, as well
 as seek ways to expedite naturalization and promote social integration. These same
 observers also agreed that the Government must provide greater opportunities for
 noncitizens to learn Latvian. In 1996 the Government worked with the United Na-
 tions Development sineam (UNDP) to begin implementing a long-term nationwide
 Latvian language teaching program  for adults and for children in non-Latvian
 schools. Until recently, the CID, which has administrative responsibility for reg-
 istering noncitizens, had a negative reputation among noncitizen residents for deny-
 ing applications for permanent status and for being slow in complying with court
 rulings on issues within its sphere of responsibility. While problems remain, inde-
 pendent observers, including those  within the National Human Rights Office
 (NRO), noted improvements in the CID's performance throughout the year.
 There are no ethnic restrictions on political participation, and some nonethnic
 Latvians serve in various elected bodies. There was no mechanism for the many
 residents of Latvia who were not citizens to participate in the elections.
 Women are underrepresented in government and politics. During the year less
 than 20 percent of parliamentarians were women. Two members of the Cabinet of
 Ministers are women: the Minister of Culture and the State Minister for Revenue.
 Only one Saeima committee-Social and Labor Affairs Relations-is chaired by a
 woman.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigatin of Alleged Violations of Hunan Rights
 A growing number of nongovernmental organizations devoted to research and ad-
 vocacy on uman rights issues, including prison conditions and women's and chil-
 
 
 1166
 dren's rights, operate without government restriction. Several organizations deal
 with issues of concern to local noncitizens and other nonethnic Latvians, presenting
 them to the courts and the press.
 The Government demonstrated a willingness to engage in dialog with nongovern-
 mental oranizations working on human ri hts issues. In June, it ratified the 1950
 European human Rights Convention. It welcomed visits by human rights organiza-
 tions and received delegations from, among others, the OSCE, the Council of Europe
 (COE), and the United Nations. A resident OSCE mission continued to operate with
 a mandate to "address citizenship issues and other related matters."
 The Government continued to implement its national program for the protection
 and promotion of human rights, which was adopted in 1995 upon the recommenda-
 tions of key international organizations.
 The National Human Rights Office's (NHRO) status as an independent institution
 with a mandate to promote human rights is respected, and its influence and visi-
 bility continue to grow. The NU-RO continued to fulfill its mandate to provide infor-
 mation on human rights, inquire into individual complaints, and initiate its own in-
 vestigations on alleged violations. In July the Government appointed Olafs Bruvers,
 a highy respeted politician and Saeima member, to a 4-year term as the perma-
 nent director of theNational Human Rights Office (NtRO). He is subject to disnis-
 sal only under limited circumstances. It also provided basic financial support for the
 organization, Which also receives grants from the United Nations Development Pro-
 gram (UNDP) and other international institutions.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disabiliiy, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 According to the 1922 Constitution, all citizens are equal under the law. In De-
 cember the Saeima decided to establish a working group to elaborate a second sec-
 tion of the Constitution that would strengthen the constitutional protection of basic
 human rights and freedoms. The 1991 Constitutional Law, which supplements the
 Constitution, states that "all persons in Latvia" are equal under the law regardless
 of race, sex, religion, language, social status, political preference, or other grounds
 and grants equal rights to work and wages to "persons of all nationalities." How-
 ever, the Constitutional Law only grants to citizens the right to occupy state posi-
 tions, establish political parties, and own land.
 Women.Sources indicate that domestic violence against women is fairly wide-
 spread and is oiten connected with alcohol abuse. There is anecdotal evidence sug-
 gesting that the legal system, including the courts, tends to downplay the serious-
 ness of domestic violence. Observers suggest that police are sometimes reluctant to
 make arrests in such cases. The NURO began to work with the Interior Ministry
 to assist victims of domestic abuse and train law enforcement personnel in dealing
 with this problem.
 Both adult and child prostitution are widespread and often linked with organized
 crime. There is no legislation in force that specifically addresses these problems.
 Women possess the same legal rights as men. The Labor Code prohibits women
 from performing "hard jobs or jobs having unhealthy conditions," that are specified
 in a list agreed upon between the Cabinet and labor unions. Moreover, the code
 bans employment discrimination. In reality women frequently face hiring and pay
 discrimination, especially in the emerging private sector. It is not unusual to see
 employment advertising that specifically seeks men. Sexual harassment of women
 in the workplace is reportedly common. Cultural factors tend to discourage women
 from coming forth publicly with complaints of abuse. Women apparently have not
 brought any discrimination suits before the courts.
 Women's advocacy groups are growing in size and number. They are involved in
 finding employment for women, lobbying for increased social benefits, assisting vic-
 tims of domestic abuse, and opposing the hazing of military recruits.
 Children.-Although it is government policy to ensure children's rights to basic
 health, welfare, and education, there is no general legislation outlining these rights,
 and the Government lacks the necessary resources to provide them ffly. For exam-
 ple, despite the existence of mandatory education, truancy is widespread.
 Evidence suggests that abandonment and child abuse, including sexual abuse, are
 relatively widespread, as is child prostitution. A few children's advocacy groups are
 active, particularly in lobbying for legislation to protect children's rights and for in-
 creased welfare payments for children. Law enforcement athoritieshave won court
 suits to remove children from abusive parents and secured convictions in child mo-
 lestation cases.
 Although legislation has long provided for the establishment of special institutions
 for the rehabilitation and vocatonal training of juvenile offenders, the Government
 
 
 1167
 
 has made only sporadic efforts to reduce the number of juveniles who have commit-
 ted relatively minor offenses, but are housed in regular prison facilities.
 People With Disabilities.-There is no law banning discrimination ag ainst the dis-
 abled. The Government supports special schools for disabled persons. It does not en-
 force a 1993 law requiringbuildings to be accessible to wheelchairs, and most build-
 ings are not. However, some larger cities, including Riga and Ventspils, have under-
 taken an extensive wheelchair ramp program at intersections.
 Religious Minorities.-There was no progress reported in apprehending the per-
 petrators of the 1995 bombing of a Riga synagogue. In July the police defused a
 Iarge bomb planted near the Jewish hospit in Riga, although it is not clear wheth-
 er te bomb was tarted against the hospital or an adjoining building.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-Of Latvia's more than 2.5 million registered
 residents, there are more than 765,000 ethnic Russians, 100,000 ethnic Belarusians,
 almost 70,000 ethnic Ukrainians, and more than 60,000 ethnic Poles. Nearly
 400,000 persons belonging to national or ethnic minorities are citizens. Because the
 majority of persons beronng to national and ethnic minorities are not citizens, they
 have difficuity participating fully in civic life. Noncitizens who are temporary resi-
 dents have particular difficulty, but the size of this group has greatly diminished
 since the adoption and implementation of the 1995 Law on the Status of Former
 Soviet Citizens who do not hold Latvian or any other citizenship.
 This law reiterates guarantees of basic human rights and provides noncitizens
 who have been permanent residents continuously since July 1, 1992, with the rights
 to change residence, leave and return, and invite close relatives to join them for the
 pu   se of family reunification. It also requires the registration of noncitizens re-
 ess of their housing status, helping to resolve cases of persons previously un-
 registered because they lived in former Soviet military or dormitory housing. The
 law also provides for issuance of new travel documents reflecting these rights (see
 Section 2.d.). However, Latvia has maintained the Soviet-era practice of requiring
 the holder's ethnicity to be printed in his passport. Groups such as Roma and
 Belarussians have complained that, because the passport is a basic form of identi-
 fication in Latvia, the requirement has opened them to various forms of discrimina-
 tion based on ethnicity.
 Various laws prohibit employment of noncitizens in certain categories. There are
 also a few distinctions in the manner of calculating eligibility for social benefits such
 as pensions, though there was progress in 1996 toward eliminating some of these
 differences. At the request of the parliamentary human rights committee, the
 NIIRO undertook a major study of all differences between the status of citizens and
 noncitizens to determine whether they may be inconsistent with constitutional pro-
 visions or international obligations and to recommend revisions in legislation if nec-
 essary. The study, released in December 1996, identified 10 differences between the
 rights of citizens and noncitizens that the NHRO considered to be inconsistent with
 obligations under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. These
 included restrictions on noncitizen employment as firefighters, armed guards, pri-
 vate detectives, members of airline crews, and certified attorneys, as well as holding
 licenses as pharmacists. In 1997 the restriction on noncitizens working as fire-
 fighters and airline personnel was removed, but the others remain in force. The
 NHRO found most other differences to be consistent with international standards
 and practices that allow a state to limit government employment, political participa-
 tion, and some property rights to those persons who are citizens.
 The language law requires employees of the State and of all "institutions, enter-
 prises and institutes' to know sufficient Latvian to carry out their profession. The
 law aso requires such employees to be conversationally proficient in Latvian in
 order to be able to deal with the public. Despite the language law, there have been
 no reports of widespread dismissals, even in the city of Daugavpils, in which only
 15 percent of the population is ethnically Latvian. Moreover, Russian is the prevail-
 ing language in state-owned industrial enterprises. Nevertheless, many nonethnic
 Latvians allege that they have been disfranchised and that the language law dis-
 criminates against them. In October the Cabinet issued regulations requiring Lat-
 vian language competence for a person to be registered and receive unemployment
 compensation and social security benefits, even when such people pay social security
 taxes. There is evidence to suggest that the problem is particularly acute in local
 government administrations outside Riga.
 As of the end of December, the Saeima Education and Science Committee was still
 considering the draft of a more restrictive language law, which passed a preliminary
 vote in the Saeima in October. In its original form, the law would require, among
 other things, cultural societies, religious organizations, and minority schools to carry
 out their activities entirely in Latvian. In addition, public gatherings and even pri-
 vate business meetings would have to be conducted in Latvian. However, faced with
 
 
 1168
 strong protests from critics in institutions ranging from the Ministry of Foreign Af-
 fairs and the NHRO to factions in the Saeima itself, and from foreign missions and
 embassies, the committee removed many of the most restrictive provisions. It re-
 tained, however, the requirement that private business meetings be held in Latvian.
 According to the committee chairman, the draft is to be submitted to the Saeima
 for a second vote early in 1998, after which it is to be returned to the committee
 for additional work before a final Saeima vote later in the year.
 Some ethnic Russians have also complained of discrimination resulting from the
 property laws, which do not allow individual noncitizens to own land. Moreover,
 noncitizeni were given fewer privatization certificates (which can be used to pur-
 chase shares of stock and to privatize apartments and land) than citizens. However,
 the law does allow land ownership by companies in which noncitizens own shares.
 The local Russian media and the Russian Government also voiced concern about
 acts of vandalism, including an attempt in June by an extreme right wing group
 called 'Thundercross" to blow up the Soviet army victory monument in Riga. Two
 people died in the blast. In September police arrested several youths belonging to
 wThundercross! in connection with the explosion. The Riga City Council voted funds
 to repair the memorial, but the damage to the structure may be irreparable.
 The Government has agreed to continue using Russian as the language of instruc-
 tion in public schools where the pupils are primarily Russian speakers. It also sup-
 ports schools in eight other minority languages. Although all non-Latvian-speaking
 students in public schools are supposed to learn Latvian and to study a minimum
 number of subjects in Latvian, there are shortages of qualified teachers.
 Most state-funded university education is in Latvian, and incoming students
 whose native language is not Latvian must pass a Latvian language entrance exam-
 ination. However, there are several private institutions offering higher education in
 Russian. In midyear the Minister of Education declined to authorize establishment
 of a branch of the Moscow State University in Riga, but the issue may be revisited.
 A lively debate continued over proposals in a draft education law that all second-
 ary education in public schools be in Latvian by the year 2005. The Parliament was
 considering several hundred amendments to the education law, and it took no le-
 gally binding decision on the long term prospects of state-funded minority language
 education.
 Throughout the year President Ulmanis spoke out forcefully in favor of the rights
 of ethnic minorities and of social integration, notably in his Independence Day ad-
 dress to the nation on November 18. On other occasions he also expressed his regret
 for Latvia's part in persecuting Jews during World War II and urged that such in-
 tolerance never again be permitted. The President's Council on Minorities and Na-
 tionalities continued to struggle to define a role for itself. During the summer, one
 of its members resigned to protest what he considered the Council's passivity. Inde-
 pendent observers say that individual Council members are well intentioned, but ex-
 press disappointment that the Council has not played a more active, public part in
 addressing minority issues; it has made no recommendations since coming into
 being.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Law on Trade Unions mandates that workers,
 except for the uniformed military, have the right to form and join labor unions of
 their own choosing. Union membership, which had been about 50 percent of the
 work force in 1993, continued to fall as workers left Soviet-era unions that include
 management or were laid off as Soviet-style factories failed. In general the trade
 union movement is undeveloped and still in transition from the socialist to the free
 market model.
 Current law does not limit the right to strike. A few job actions, including a teach-
 ers 'phone in" to protest low pay, occurred. Although many state-owned factories are
 on the verge of bankruptcy and seriously behind in wage payments, workers fear
 dismissal if they strie. While the law bans such dismissals, the government has
 not effectively enforced these laws.
 Unions are free to affiliate internationally and are developing contacts with Euro-
 pean labor unions and international labor union organizations.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectvely.-Labor unions have the right
 to bargain collectively and are largely free of government interference in their nego-
 tiations with em loyers. The law prohibits discrimination against union members
 and organizers. Some emerging private sector businesses, however, threaten to fire
 union members. These businesses usually provide better salaries and benefits than
 are available elsewhere. The Government's ability to protect the right to organize
 in the private sector is weak.
 There are no export processing zones.
 
 
 1169
 
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The law prohibits forced or com-
 pulsory labor, including among children, and it is not practiced. Inspectors from the
 Ministry of Welfare's Labor Department enforce this ban.
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment.-The stat-
 utory minimum age for employment of children is 15 years, although those from 13
 to 15 years of ag may work in certain jobs after school hours. Children are required
 to attend school for 9 years. The law restricts employment of those under age 18,
 for instance, by banning night shift or overtime work. State authorities are lax in
 their enforcement of child labor and school attendance laws. However, there is no
 evidence of forced or bonded labor involving children that is prohibited by law (see
 Section 6.c.).
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The Government raised the monthly minimum
 wage to about $70 (38 lats), far below the amount that trade union officials describe
 as the bare minimum for survival. Many factories are virtually bankrupt and have
 reduced work hours. The Labor Code provides for a mandatory 40-hour maximum
 workweek with at least one 24-hour rest period weekly, 4 weeks of annual vacation,
 and a program of assistance to working mothers with small children. The laws es-
 tablish minimum occupational health and safety standards for the workplace, but
 these standards are frequently ignored. Workers have the legal- right to remove
 themselves from hazardous work situations, but these standards are frequently ig-
 nored in practice.
