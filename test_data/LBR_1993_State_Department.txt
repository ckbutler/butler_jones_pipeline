 LIBERIA
 In 1993 Liberia remained divided geographically and factionally into three main
 regions and competing political-military groups as a result of the 4-year civil war.
 The Interim Government of National Unity (IGNU), a coalition of political parties
 and interest groups led by President Amos Sawyer, administered Monrovia and the
 expanded perimeter around it secured by the Economic Community of West African
 States (ECOWAS) Cease-fire Monitoring Group (ECOMOG). Over half of the coun-
 try's current population resided within IGNI~s area. The Charles Taylor-led Na-
 tional Patriotic Reconstruction Assembly Government (NPRAG) and its political-
 military arm, the National Patriotic Front of Liberia (NPFL), held several central
 and southern counties. The anti-NPFL United Liberation Movement for Democracy
 in Liberia (ULIMO), led by Alhaji Kromah, controlled the three western counties
 and portions of two central counties. The other important warring faction is the
 Armed Forces of Liberia (AFL), the remnants of the late President Samuel Doe's
 army, which is nominally subordinate to IGNU but also has close ties to ULIMO.
 During the last quarter of the year, the Liberian Peace Council (LPC), which has
 ties to the AFL, initiated a military campaign against NPFL control of the south-
 eastern counties while the Lofa Defense Force (LDF) emerged in the northwest to
 challenge ULIMO.
 The three major Liberian groups (IGNU, NPFL, ULIMO) executed a peace accord
 on July 25-the third such agreement since 1990- under the auspices of ECOWAS,
 the United Nations, and the Organization of African Unity (OAU). The accord rees-
 tablished a cease-fire and provided for demobilization of warring factions, a unified
 national transitional government, and free elections by March 1994. However, there
 was little movement through the rest of the year in implementing the accord, pri-
 marily because of factional differences in interpreting the accord and delays in the
 arrival of additional peacekeepers needed to help carry out disarmament. In Sep-
 tember the United Nations Security Council established a U.N. Observer Mission
 in Liberia (UNOMIL), in accordance with the peace accord, to help ECOMOG mon-
 itor the cease-fire and disarmament. By year's end, over 270 of an expected 303
 UNOMIL military observers had arrived in Liberia.
 The July accord helped stabilize the military situation which had been in flux
 since October 1992, when ECOMOG forces, assisted by AFL and ULIMO troops,
 successfully defended Monrovia against NPFL attacks. Subsequently, the ECOMOG
 extended the capital's defensive perimeter in the first months of the year, taking
 the port of Buchanan, Liberia's second city approximately 50 miles southeast of
 Monrovia, and Kakata, a key transportation hub 30 miles northeast of Monrovia.
 Meanwhile, ULIMO displaced the NPFL from substantial areas in northwestern
 and central Liberia. By April fighting subsided to sporadic low-intensity encounters
 along the enlarged perimeter.
 ECOMOG assumed most police powers in Monrovia because the IGNU police
 force, reconstituted in 1991, initially was unarmed and ineffective, although IGNU
 later formed some relatively better equipped armed special security units. NPFL
 and ULIMO military and police forces asserted control in their areas. There were
 massive human rights violations by NPFL, ULIMO, and AFL units during 1993.
 
 
 149
 While ECOMOG forces generally conducted themselves well, they were also respon-
 sible for a number of serious abuses (see Sections l.a. and 1.g.).
 The civil war-ravaged economy, previously based primarily on iron ore, rubber,
 timber, diamonds, and gold exports, continued to decline. The year's gross domestic
 product was projected at less than hal  f prewar levels. Massive emergency oper-
 ations by the United Nations, as well as by American and other Western-based re-
 lief agencies and nongovernmental organizations (NGO's), brought subsistence-level
 humanitarian assistance to most Liberians. These operations continued throughout
 1993 but were periodically suspended outside of Monrovia because of intermittent
 fighting, harassment of relief workers by combatants, and security restrictions im-
 posed by ECOMOG.
 While all parties professed to honor the 1985 Liberian Constitution, roughly based
 on the United States model, the document's provisions were selectively ignored and
 unevenly applied, although less so in IGNU-controlled areas. Human rights were
 widely violated, particularly for civilians in territory controlled by the NPFL and
 ULIMO armed factions. Since 1989, an estimated 150,000 Liberians have been
 killed or wounded as a result of the conflict, and hundreds of thousands have fled
 abroad or are displaced within Liberia. On June 6, according to a U.N.-commis-
 sioned investigation the AFL massacred over 500 displaced persons, mostly defense-
 less women and children, at the Firestone plantation near Harbel. Credible reports
 indicated that NPFL fighters killed over 130 civilians at Fassima, Lofa County, on
 May 15. All warring factions committed other egregious human rights violations
 e.g., use of excessive force arbitrary detentions, forced conscription, torture, and
 summary executions. IGNU security personnel and, to a much lesser extent, individ-
 ual ECOMOG soldiers committed excesses in Monrovia during the year.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-Numerous cases of extrajudicial kill-
 ing were reported. Although professing adherence to the rule of law, the leaders of
 the warring factions condoned and, in some instances, seemingly encouraged lethal
 brutality (see Section 1.g.).
 The ECOMOG peacekeepingforce maintained a commendable record and policy
 against unlawful behavior, but there were reported incidents of individual
 ECOMOG fighters killing civilians. An unconfirmed account implicated ECOMOG
 soldiers in the fatal January beating of a youth identified as an NPFL fighter by
 residents of a Monrovia suburb. In addition, ULIMO efforts to consolidate its posi-
 tion in Lofa County prompted credible reports of numerous political killings there
 during the last quarter of 1993.
 There were no reported cases of the factions punishing fighters for politically mo-
 tivated killings. In one instance, the AFL imposed capital punishment against a sol.
 dier convicted in the criminal homicide of a Monrovia resident. Human rights ob-
 servers viewed the case not as a genuine commitment to instill professional dis-
 cipline but as a ploy by the AFL hierarchy to disarm criticism of its institutional
 behavior.
 b. Disappearance.-Disappearances were not believed to be common, but there
 were reports (of varying degrees of credibility) of young men disappearing while in
 the custody of AFL NPFL, or ULIMO fighters, possibly victims of forcedconscrip-
 tion or execution. Very little new information was available about persons missing
 as a result of the war. The October 1992 NPFL attack on Monrovia resulted in hun-
 dreds of missing suburban Monrovia residents. Others disappeared when fighting
 spread to other parts of the country. There were credible reports that many people
 were unwillingly moved to sites in NPFL territory. Many of those forcibly removed
 were feared to have been killed.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution prohibits torture and degrading treatment. While not descending
 to the same level of the 1989-90 civil war period, inhuman treatment continued to
 be frequent. Monrovia remained the safest area for civilians, but reliable sources
 claimed that IGNU police frequently beat criminal suspects in their custody. The
 IGNU Ministry of Internal Affairs sometimes relied on "trial by ordeal" or
 "sassywood"--subjecting suspects to the excruciation of metal objects heated by
 burning wood-to coerce confessions in criminal investigations.
 There are credible reports that ECOMOG soldiers beat criminal suspects and har-
 assed individuals at ECOMOG checkpoints in Monrovia. Prominent Monrovia politi-
 cian Peter Bonner Jallah, arrested in November 1992 for allegedly aiding the N1PFL
 attack on Monrovia, credibly claimed he was tortured by ECOMOG and IGNU intel-
 ligence officers, as evidenced by the impaired use of his hands.
 
 
 150
 NPFL soldiers were also widely accused of beating and torturing civilians, espe-
 cially persons suspected of being ULIMO operatives. At numerous highway check-
 points in NPFL areas, NPFL forces beat civilians and forced them to disrobe, usu-
 ally in connection with extortion or other forms of intimidation. Much of the re-
 ported NPFL inhuman treatment was centered in Grand Gedeh County, the home
 county of the late president Samuel Doe and his Krahn ethnic group. NPFL leader
 Charles Taylor publicly condemned harassment of civilians but chose to discipline
 offending troops only when expedient.
 Civilians in ULIMO-held areas fared little better. ULIMO checkpoint guards and
 roving bands harassed and beat civilians if they resisted extortion. For example, in
 June ULIMO bands raided several villages in Cape Mount County, beating and
 threatening villagers alleged to be NPFL accomplices. There were also numerous re-
 ports, difficult to confirm, of ULIMO'S Mandingo forces executing or generally
 harassing citizens of Lofa County because of religious and ethnic differences.
 Conditions in the nation's often makeshift jails were hazardous to life and health
 prior to the civil war and were more dismal in 1993. Reports were remarkably simi-
 lar prisoners denied medical care, family contacts, and adequate food; living in
 small, crowded, and filthy cells or rooms. It was not possible to determine whether
 any prisoners died because of these conditions. In Monrovia pretrial detainees were
 often housed with convicted criminals, but women and children appeared to be held
 separately. IGNU has not given prison reform a high priority, and there has been
 no attempt to improve the largely untrained guard force. The Monrovia-based Cen-
 ter for Law and Human Rights Education and other human rights advocates were
 finally allowed to visit the Central Prison toward the end of the year after IGNU
 had denied previous requests for access.
 The AFL continued to detain an unknown number of alleged NPFL collaborators
 at its stockade in Monrovia. According to a leading human rights organization, these
 detainees (including children)-many held incommunicado-suffered deplorable liv-
 ing conditions and experienced occasional harassment by cell guards.
 The conditions of detention in NPFL and ULIMO territory were even worse, ac-
 cording to credible sources; both factions held prisoners in makeshift, substandard
 facilities and subjected them to various forms of mistreatment. A prominent Monro-
 via journalist and another credible returnee described physical and psychological
 mistreatment-including beatings, rape, and threatened executions-a abducted ci-
 vilians.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The 1985 Constitution prohibits arbi-
 trary arrests, but in the aftermath of the war there were few functioning institu-
 tional safeguards preventing these malpractices. The Constitution provides for the
 rights of the accused, including warrants for arrests and the right of detainees ei-
 ther to be charged or to be released within 48 hours. These provisions were widely
 ignored, although the bail system functioned relatively well in Monrovia.
 IGNU President Sawyer repeatedly affirmed his administration's respect for con-
 stitutional procedural safeguards. However, administrative inefficiency, delays in
 appointing judges, and poorly trained criminal justice personnel resulted in detain-
 ees being held for long periods without trial or charges. In practice, police officers
 had wide discretion to make arrests. This authority was often abused. Arrests regu-
 larly took place without probable cause. Many police officers accepted bribes to ar-
 rest persons based on unsubstantiated allegations. At times they failed to inform
 detainees of the charges against them, and often charges went unrecorded. Many
 suspects were held incommunicado. Police occasionally coerced confessions from per-
 sons illegally detained.
 As ECOMOG gradually took on more police duties in response to the escalating
 crime rate, citizens called on ECOMOG soldiers to arrest and detain alleged crimi-
 nals. However, detentions by ECOMOG peacekeepers did not alwa'ys satisfy con-
 stitutional or internationally recognized standards. ECOMOG soldiers sometimes
 physically coerced confessions from suspects.
 While accurate arrest information was unavailable, charged and uncharged pre-
 trial detainees formed a sizable portion of the total incarcerated population at year's
 end and likely numbered in the hundreds. It was impossible to determine the num-
 ber of political detainees among this total. However, politician Peter Bonner Jallah
 remained confined after being detained by ECOMOG in November 1992 for alleg-
 edly abetting the NPFL attack on Monrovia. According to Jallah's attorney,
 ECOMOG has failed to produce evidence implicating his client or to charge him for-
 mally. Criminal law also allows for the writ of habeas corpus, but the IGNU judici-
 ary denied a September attempt to secure a writ on behalf of Bonner Jallah. The
 denial was on the basis that he was a "prisoner of war"-even after the July cease-
 fire accord provided for the release of all faction prisoners and although the term
 
 
 is of questionable applicability to internal armed conflicts. There was no change in
 the Jallah case by year's end.
 Arbitrary detentions were commonplace in NPFL territory where martial law has
 been in effect since the war began. NPFL soldiers and police officers had almost un-
 bridled power to make warrantless arrests. They exercised that power often and ca-
 priciously, detaining hundreds of persons on spurious grounds or without charge for
 periods ranging from several hours to several weeks. Detainees in NPFL territory
 were rarely informed of their legal rights. The writ of habeas corpus remained sus-
 pended, and access to bail was basically unavailable. ULIMO's arrest and detention
 practices mirrored the NPFL's lack of procedural safeguards.
 Many Monrovia area residents abducted by NPFL fighters during the October
 1992 attack on Monrovia remained in NPFL custody. The NPFL refused to relin-
 quish custody of over 250 orphans abducted from a Monrovia suburb in 1992, de-
 spite U.N. and other humanitarian entreaties. In early 1993, the AFL detained over
 a dozen suspected NPFL supporters whose fate is unknown.
 During the year, there were no reports of Liberians being subjected to forced polit-
 ical exile.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Tria--Liberia's legal system is closely modeled on that
 of the United States, with the Supreme Court at its apex. Before the civil war, how-
 ever, the system afforded little protection in practice for defendants, due to corrup-
 tion among court officials, lack of training, and a domineering executive branch. By
 mid-1990, the system had completely collapsed, along with the rest of civil author-
 ity, with justice resting in the hands of the military commanders of the factions.
 In 1991 IGNU slowly began to reconstitute the court system in the Monrovia area.
 It reestablished several magistrate courts in Monrovia and swore into office new cir-
 cuit court judges. In Monrovia criminal defendants, in theory and generally in prac-
 tice, were entitled to a defense attorney, pretrial discovery of accusatory material,
 and the right to appeal. Corruption in the judiciary was a recurrent problem, often
 cited by human rights monitors, the press, and members of the bar. There seemed
 to be no overt judicial interference by the IGNU executive. However, the courts al-
 most universally sided with IGNU in controversial cases as in the Jallah case when
 the criminal court denied him a writ of habeas corpus on highly questionable legal
 grounds.
 In addition to the resurrection of the modem court system, customary law was
 also applied in many areas. In Monrovia the Ministry of Internal Affairs often sub-
 jectd persons accused of occult practices and other crimes to "trial by ordeal," i.e.,
 submitting defendants to physical travail to adjudicate innocence or guilt (see Sec-
 tion 1.c.). This customary mode of justice was also used by traditional authorities
 in some rural courts which operated in 1993 in areas under GNU control.
 There are few national institutions still working across faction lines. The ad hoc
 Supreme Court is one exception. Under the auspices of the ECOWAS peace process,
 IGU and the NPFL agreed on the creation of a five-member ad hoc Supreme Court
 in September 1991. In 1992 IGNU and NPRAG agred that the Court should have
 the full jurisdiction provided by the Constitutionl a  c Supreme Court, which
 has assumed the fu11 jurisdiction of the regular Supreme Court, continued hearing
 a variety of civil and criminal cases in 1993 but, like the rest of the court system,
 tende     ad t  ontroversial cases arising from the violation of law and human
 rights during the civil war. Under the July peace accord, ULIMO named a justice
 to fill the seat on the bench left vacant by the 1993 death of the Chief Justice.
 The NPFL also partially reactivated in 1991 the court system in areas under its
 control. In practice, legal and judicial protections were almost totally lacking as ex-
 ecutive branch interference was pervasive and overt. ULIMO judicial practices and
 protections were equally suspect to the extent they existed.
 Given the situation in Liberia, it was not possible to determine either the number
 of political detainees (see Section l.d.) or political prisoners among the many pris-
 oners" being held by the various factions. An illustrated news report in December,
 however, charged that some 800 of the 1,000 prisoners held at the substandard
 Monrovia Central Prison under IGNU and ECOMOG guard were ex-combatants,
 primarily from the failed October 1992 NPFL attack on Monrovia. Embarrassed by
 the situation, IGNU appointed a panel to investigate the allegations.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-While
 the Constitution provides for these rights, there were many serious auses of pri-
 vacy and home-including confiscation of property and failure to obtain required
 warrants-by soldiers of all of the warring factions. There was no evidence of fre-
 quent surveillance of individuals.
 AFL soldiers committed many armed robberies in the Monrvia area. As
 ECOMOG expanded its defensive perimeter, AFL or ULIMO brigands followed to
 pillage and loot these areas, including the Firestone plantation. Virtually any valu-
 
 
 able object was pilfered. ULIMO fighters regularly raided villages in their areas and
 conducted house searches for loot to sell in Monrovia. They also illegally occupied
 many private homes.
 The situation regarding interference with person orproperty in NPFL territory
 was even more abysmal. Throughout NPFL territory, NPFL soldiers regularly de-
 manded scarce food and personal valuables from already impoverished residents or
 displaced persons and often robbed and physically abused travelers, particularly at
 checkpoints. Confiscation of private homes and vehicles was also common practice.
 To escape harassment, many Liberians moved their families to remote areas or out
 of Liberia. Occasionally ECOMOG conducted searches, without warrants, of Monro-
 via households for weapons caches, but there were no reported incidents of violence
 or theft during these searches.
 g. Use of Excessive Force and Violations of Humanitarian Law in Internal Con-
 flicts.-During the first half of 1993, fighting moved to western and central Liberia
 as the military tide turned against the NPFL after its unsuccessful attack on Mon-
 rovia in October 1992. As has been the case throughout the civil war, "fighting" was
 an inaccurate description, for there were few battles between opposing militaries.
 In fact, the warring factions inflicted considerably more harm on noncombatants
 than on each other. AFL, NPFL and ULIMO fighters indiscriminately ransacked
 villages, abused populations, and confiscated scant food supplies. They also mur.
 dered innocent civilians and regularly committed violence against women, including
 rape.
 Although there was no credible evidence of willful ECOMOG violations of humani-
 tarian law, there were incidents of civilian deaths and damage from ECOMOG aer-
 ial strikes. In late February, ECOMOG planes strafed near the Cote d'Ivoire border,
 injuring some civilians and temporarily panicking civilians and relief workers in the
 areas. In September Nigerian planes, a in ierra Leone and supporting both the
 Sierra Leonean counteransurrection and the ECOMOG operation, strafed a refugee
 settlement along the border, killing 6 and injuring nearly 40 persons.
 On June 6, a group of armed lighters slaughtered over 500 displaced persons,
 mostly women and children, at a settlement on the Firestone plantation at Harbel.
 A U.N. investigation team, comprised of three eminent international lawyers and
 human rights advocates, concluded in a September report that the AFL committed
 the act and cited substantial evidence supprting this finding. AFL soldiers were
 also caught in possession of proprty looted from the settlement. The Interim Gov-
 ernment and the AFL disputed the U.N. team's finding, insisting on NPFL culpabil-
 ity. Three AFL soldiers whom the U.N. report identified as key participants in the
 massacre were initially ordered held by IGN but were never actually detained or
 arrested by IGNU or AFL authorities.
 In another highly publicized case, several AFL soldiers in late January killed Brit-
 ish scientist Brian Garnham at his animal research institute outside Monrovia. Ac-
 cording to witnesses, Garnham was pleading for his life when fatally shot at close
 range. The assailants, without any basis had accused Garnham of NPFL sym-
 pathies. The Interim Government established an AFL-chaired committee to inves-
 tigate the incident. However, credible human rights monitors criticized the compsi-
 tion and the poor performance of the committee. At year's end, no suspect had  en
 formally charged with the murder; lesser charges against one of the five soldiers im-
 plicated in the incident were dismissed by an AFL court-martial, and the cases
 against the others languished.
 The NPFL also committed unlawful killings. In early May, a broadcast reportedly
 intercepted by ECOMOG recorded NPFL leadership ordering fighters to target civil-
 ian populations in a "reign of terror." Shortly thereafter, a massacre of more than
 130 civilians at Fassima took place. Although the massacre is believed to have been
 committed by NPFL fighters, the facts of the incident were not subsequently con-
 firmed by independent investigation or prosecution. Survivors were believed to have
 been abducted and massively abused. In January dozens of bodies-several be-
 headed-were found in unmarked graves in Monrovia's northwestern suburbs. The
 killings were probably committed by NPFL fighters before retreating from the area
 in November and December 1992. While advancing toward Buchanan in March,
 ECOMOG troops found scores of civilian corpses along the roadsides. NPFL fighters
 apparently killed civilians who tried to flee to ECOMOG lines.
 NPFL fighters are also believed responsible for the massacre of over 200 civilians
 in separate incidents in Montserrado and Margibi counties, north of Monrovia. An
 unconfirmed report attributed the alleged executions of another 200 displaced per-
 sons in Camp Todee to the NPFL. Many of the most egregious NPFL offenses con-
 tinued to take place in Grand Gedeh County, where Gio and Mano NPFL fighters
 exacted revenge against their Krahn ethnic rivals. In September fighting was re-
 ported between the NPFL and the Krahn-dominated LPC along the Grand Gedeh
 
 
 153
 County-Ivoirian border. Military operations by the LPC in the southeast during the
 last quarter of the year resulted in many civilian deaths. There were credible re-
 ports of LPC abuses against suspected NPFL sympathizers and members of other
 ethnic grus
 ULIt so preyed on civilians in its area. Residents, local human rights organi-
 zations, and relief workers reported numerous ULIMO human rights abuses in Lofa
 County. Advancing ULIMO fighters executed several village elders for being alleged
 supporters or harboring the NPFL in their villages. Often the victims executed had
 been forced to accommodate the NPFL under threat of bodily harm. Unconfirmed
 reports also indicated that ULIMO might have executed several NPFL fighters at-
 tempting to surrender after the August 1 cease-fire. Intensified ULIMO operations
 in Lofa County after August prompted the emergence of the Lofa Defense Force,
 which charged Mandingo members of ULIMO with abusing local citizens. Credible
 sources claimed that both ULIMO and the NPFL executed innocent civilians, usu-
 ally young men, on the mere suspicion that the victims belonged to the rival group.
 Both ULIMO and the NPFL mistreated Sierra Leonean refugees living in western
 Liberia.
 Continuing a practice begun in 1992, both ULIMO and AFL troops executed civil-
 ians in Monrovia, according to reliable sources. These reports cited AFL and ULIMO
 squads targeting former members of the NPFL and the Independent National Patri-
 otic Front or Liberia, a defunct offshoot of the NPFL. Nighttime bands of AFL and
 ULIMO fighters occasionally roamed sections of the city searching for Gio and Mano
 tribe members from Nimba County, whom they would torture or kill.
 Both ULIMO and the NPFL exploited minors as fighters. During the first half of
 the year, the NPFL continued its program of involuntary conscription, includin
 children, in Nimba County and southeastern Liberia. The NPFL beat and tortured
 persons who refused to join their ranks and local government officials who refused
 to implement the conscription program.
 The warring factions tried to exploit humanitarian relief efforts to their political
 advantage, often to the detriment of the affected populations. After intensifying its
 Lofa operations, ULIMO denied relief workers access to besieged areas and hijacked
 their vehicles and supplies on several occasions. The NPFL used relief convoys en-
 tering its area as a means of circumventing ECOWAS economic sanctions and pos-
 sibly the international arms embargo. The NPFL insisted that relief must cross the
 international border with Cote d'Ivoire although direct shipments from Monrovia
 constituted the shortest route to the most needy populations in NPFL territoa. In
 the absence of mechanisms to monitor the contents of relief convoys, ECOMO im-
 posed restrictions on NGO and U.N. relief operations, including cross-border deliv-
 eries. In September ECOMOG acceded to more liberal cross-border operations once
 its arms embargo and economic sanctions enforcement concerns were resolved by
 the stationing of monitors at key entry points.
 A number of Liberian employees of relief organizations, including the United Na-
 tions, were detained by the factions during the year; some were beaten or threat-
 ened. For example, in October the NPFL detained 10 drivers and workers of a U.N.
 World Food Program convoy on suspicion of spying, held them for several weeks,
 and mistreated some of them. A few foreign relief workers also were detained, most-
 ly for short periods. In one case detained relief workers were forced to endure an
 ad hoc trial and mock execution. Occasionally, NPFL and ULIMO soldiers tried to
 confiscate relief supplies or relief vehicles from relief workers; fighters from all fac-
 tions commonly confiscated relief food after the humanitarian groups had distrib-
 uted it.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-These freedoms are provided for in the Con-
 stitution and, with some significant limitations, were generally exercised in Monro-
 via. There were more far-reaching limitations elsewhere. Due primarily to continued
 economic stagnation, the number of media organs in Monrovia diminished to a
 proximately 5 to 7 privately owned newspapers (down from 12 in 1992), 3 of whic
 published regularly. The Interim Government newspaper, The Liberian Times, was
 not published in 1993. Official press censorship was not pervasive in Monrovia. nor
 were any newspapers forcibly closed during the year. However, the Monrovia press
 tended to be pro-IGNU; and some journalists admitted self-cnsorship. Other jour-
 nalists asserted that constant public calls by IGNU officials for a "more responsible"
 press had a chilling effect on journalistic freedom. At times journalists were re-
 quested to meet privately with IGNU officials who had been offended by articles.
 In reaction to perceived NPFL military preparations along the defensive perim-
 eter in May and June, IGNU ordered that journalists submit all "war-related" sto-
 ries to the Ministries of Information and Justice for clearance on national security
 
 
 grounds. The Press Union of Liberia and newspaper publishers objected to the
 measure as a prior restraint. The Press Union and the Interim Government later
 compromised on guidelines for military reporting. In September IGNU repealed de-
 cree 88-a, which had been used by the former Doe regime to stifle free speech by
 criminalizing criticism of government on national security grounds. However, a re-
 strictive, Doe-era media law, providing the Ministry of Information wide discretion
 in licensing and regulating journalists, still remained on the books.
 There were no official or private newspaers printed in NPFL or ULIMO terri-
 tory. International journalists visited NPFL areas intermittently throughout the
 year, with no indications of official censorship. Because of the fighting, journalists
 from Monrovia were prohibited from covering events in NPFL areas, and vice versa.
 Residents of Liberia Tad to exercise care in their criticism of the various factions.
 Although NPFL leader Charles Taylor affirmed publicly on several occasions that
 his government supported free speech, citizens inhis area were subject to sanctions
 for criticizing the NPFL. Citizens in ULIMO territory also had to exercise care.
 After a group of citizens published a statement thatULIMO should relinquish to
 IGNU control of the western counties, the UL1MO leadership exerted pressure for
 a retraction.
 IGNU supported a shortwave radio station (ELBC) and also continued radio
 broadcasts in 1993. News reports were favorable to IGNU, and many credible jour-
 nalists allege substantial censorship by ELBC. The NPFL intermittently operated
 two radio stations in its area. NPFL news programs uncritically supported Charles
 Taylor's NPFL and offered no criticism of his political program.
 The University of Liberia, which closed temporarily after fighting erupted in Octo-
 ber 1992, was open most of the year. Academic freedom was generally respected,
 although pm-NPFL expression was criticized by university authorities and most of
 the student body.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 the rights of peaceful assembly and association. In Monrovia, several groups held
 peaceful demonstrations-ranging from support of the peace process to a group cele-
 brating late president Doe's birthday. Some of the unhindered processions were crit-
 ical of IGNU, and most took place without permits. Nevertheless, authorities moved
 quickly to disband gatherings that they believed could incite unrest. In June
 ECOMOG prohibited a pro-ULIMO rally at a local sports stadium, in September
 ECOMOG and IGNU police peacefully dispersed demonstrations by market vendors
 protesting rising wholesale prices. The 7 p.m. to 7 a.m. nighttime curfew in Monro-
 via, imposed after the NPFL attack in 1992, continued in force. ECOMOG soldiers
 were ordered to enforce the measure strictly, and numerous persons were arrested
 for noncompliance. AFL soldiers reportedly killed or wounded a few citizens for
 breaking the curfew. ECOMOG periodically meted out corporal punishment to re-
 peat curfew violators.
 Political parties and other groups were able to organize freely and hold public
 meetings in Monrovia. Freedom of assembly and association was generally more re-
 strictedin NPFL areas than in Monrovia. None of the prewar political parties was
 known to have held public meetings in NPFL areas. There were several anti-U.N.
 demonstrations in NPFL territory protesting the alleged lack of U.N. humanitarian
 assistance to NPFL areas and perceived pro-IGNU bias by the United Nations.
 These demonstrations were probably orchestrated by NPFL officials. Citizens could
 not independently organize public demonstrations, particularly any critical of the
 NPFL. In ULIMO areas, residents still felt intimidated and did not attempt dem-
 onstrations critical of ULIMO for fear of reprisal.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The 1985 Constitution recognizes freedom of religion as
 a fundamental right, and Liberia has no established state religion. Christianity has
 long been the religion of the political and economic elite, while the majority of the
 population follows traditional religions or practices a mixture of traditional religions
 and Christianity or Islam.
 There was no evidence of systematic violation of religious freedom by warring fac-
 tions, but there were isolated and sometimes violent incidents of religious repression
 by local fighters.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Constitution provides for freedom of movement throughout Liberia
 as well as the right to leave or enter the country at will. Freedom of movement in
 and out of Monrovia was generally respected by IGNU, though ECOMOG and AFL
 checkpoints impeded the movement of relief workers and supplies.
 Freedom of movement, ranging from resettlement of displaced persons to ordinary
 commerce and travel, was inhibited by factional fighting in the first half of 1993.
 Throughout the year, NPFL and ULIMO forces impeded movement by extorting and

 harassing citizens at checkpoints. The NPFL prohibited thousands of displaced per-
 sons from traveling to seek refuge behind ECOMOG lines.
 Over 700,000 Liberian refugees remained in neighboring West African countries,
 many out of fear of ethnic persecution. The number of refugees increased and de-
 creased depending on the intensity and proximity of the fighting to population cen-
 ters in Liberia. The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees reported that as many
 as 30,000 Liberian refugees may have returned spontaneously in 1993. Most of
 these returnees went to Monrovia, where they were well received and were provided
 assistance by a network consisting of the U.N. agencies, IGNU, and international
 and domestic nongovernmental relief groups.
 There are approximately 100,000 Sierra Leonean refugees in Liberia. Although
 many Sierra Leoneans were mistreated by the NPFL and ULIMO, there were no
 reports of such refugees being forced to leave Liberia.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Despite constitutional and statutory guarantees of free and fair elections, Libe-
 rians could not exercise the right to change their government. As fighting continued
 the first half of the year, there was again intense activity in the search for new po-
 litical formulas to restore unity under a popularly elected leadership. Under joint
 U.N., OAU, and ECOWAS auspices leaders of IGNU, the NPFL, and ULIMO ham-
 mered out a peace accord in late July after negotiations in Geneva and Cotonou,
 Benin. The agreement called for demobilization of the warring factions and the in-
 stitution of a unified transitional government to organize elections for February-
 March 1994. Pursuant to the accord, the rival IGNU, NPRAG, and ULIMO adminis-
 trations would dissolve as rival administrations upon the installation of the transi-
 tional government. The peace accord was welcomed by the overwhelming majority
 of Liberians. Its implementation, however, lagged behind schedule at year's end be-
 cause of lack of agreement among the factions about the timetable for disarmament,
 demobilization, and the seating of the transitional government, and because of
 delays in the arrival of the additional ECOMOG forces needed to help accomplish
 these objectives.
 IGNU is a coalition government comprised of the major prewar political parties
 and interest groups. Power in IGNU mainly resides in the executive branch, led by
 President Amos Sawyer, not in the legislature or the judiciary. NPRAG also has
 three separate branches of government. But unlike the coalition-based IGNU,
 Charles Taylor remained the NPRAG's supreme leader. Unlike IGNU and NPRAG,
 ULIMO did not establish formal legislative, executive, or judiciary structures in its
 area. Decisions are made by senior level ULIMO political and military officials, with
 ULIMO leader Alhaji Kromah the primary decisionmaker.
 Neither the legislature in Monrovia nor that in Gbarnga was truly representative.
 However, the interim legislature in Monrovia at times asserted its role as a sepa-
 rate branch of government, both confirming and rejecting imp-rtant IGNU ap-
 pointees following public confirmation hearings.
 There are no restrictions in law on the participation of women in politics- but, in
 practice, only a few women hold Cabinet-level positions in the IGNU and NPRAG
 governments, none in significant decisionmaking positions. Overall numbers of
 women in the two governments and the various political parties are small.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The few domestic human rights organizations are relatively new and underfunded
 but made progress improving their influence, visibility, and performance in 1993.
 Two groups occasionally published news apers dedicated to human rights. None of
 the organizations reported any major IGNU interference with their activities, al-
 though IGNU authorities sometimes criticized the organizations, and, in the case of
 The Center for Human Rights Education, prevented its members from monitoring
 conditions at Monrovia's Central Prison.
 The attitude of NPRAG toward the human rights organizations was less clearly
 enunciated, and its conduct to date has not been encouraging. Some Monrovia-based
 activists feared for their personal safety, claiming that the NPFL had previously ac-
 cused them of being IGNU agents. There was one human rights organization based
 in NPFL territory, but it did not appear to be active or effective. ULIMO officials
 insisted on monitoring the activities of human rights grovps visiting its area.
 In August a three-member U.N. team visited Liberia to investigate the June 6
 Harbel massacre of over 500 innocent displaced persons. Both NPFL and IGNU offi-
 cials cooperated with the panel. There were no apparent signs of interference with
 the panel's work, though 1GNU publicly criticized the panel's September report,
 
 
 which concluded that the AFL perpetrated the atrocity. A representative of the U.S.
 human rights monitoring organization Africa Watch visited Liberia early in the year
 and did not experience interference by IGNU authorities in Monrovia. However,
 ULIMO refused to allow the Africa Watch representative to visit its area without
 an ULIMO escort.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The 1985 Constitution prohibits discrimination based on ethnic background, race,
 sex, creed, place of origin, or political opinion, but discrimination exists de facto and
 in some cases de jure.
 Women.-The status of women in Liberian society varies by region, ethnic group,
 and religion. Some women currently hold skilled jobs, including in government and
 business. In the past 2 years, several women's organizations were established in
 Monrovia and Gbarnga to advance family welfare issues, to help promote political
 reconciliation, and to assist in rehabilitating former combatants as well as civilian
 victims of war. In urban areas and along the coast, women can inherit land and
 property. In rural areas, where traditional customs are stronger, a woman is nor-
 mally considered the property of her husband and his clan and usually is not enti-
 tled to inherit from her husband.
 Women in most rural areas are responsible for much of the farm labor and have
 only limited access to education. According to a recent U.N. study, females in Libe-
 ria, on average, receive only about 28 percent of the schooling given to males. In
 the massive violence inflicted on civilians during the conflict, women suffered the
 gamut of abuses (see especially Sections l.c. and 1.g.). Even prior to the war, domes-
 tic violence against women was extensive but never seriously addressed as an issue
 by the Government, women's groups, the courts, or the media.
 Children.-In the civil war, the various sides have given almost no attention to
 the welfare of children, and the education and nurturing of children has been seri-
 ously disrupted. The NPFL and ULIMO recruited and employed children as combat-
 ants. As a result, children have become both victims and abusers in the conflict.
 Some NGO's have initiated small retraining and rehabilitation programs for a lim-
 ited number of former child fighters. At year's end, the United Nations and NGO's
 were discussing plans within the overall peace process for special counseling and
 training of the bulk of young combatants once they demobilize (see also Sections 1.g.
 and 6.d.).
 Female genital mutilation (circumcision), which international health experts have
 condemned as physically and psychologically damaging, is widely practiced at an
 early age, particularly in isolated rural areas and among traditional societies. Ac-
 cording to an independent expert in the field, the percentage of Liberian females
 who have undergone this procedure may be as high as 60 percent.
 National/Racial /Ethnic Minorities.-Although the Constitution bans ethnic dis-
 crimination, it also provides that only "persons who are negroes or of negro descent"
 may be citizens or own land, thus denying full rights to many who were born or
 lived most of their lives in Liberia. Neither Monrovia's Interim Government nor
 Gbarnga's NPRAG has considered repealing this racial test. In July IGNU
 reaffirmed a 1975 economic "Liberianization" law, which prohibited foreign owner-
 ship in certain business sectors. The law resulted in the closure or sale of several
 foreign-owned businesses.
 The roots of the civil conflict can be found in the historical division between the
 Americo-Liberian minority, who for over 150 years dominated the political, eco-
 nomic, and cultural life of the country, and the indigenous ethnic groups. The latter
 frequently complained of government discrimination in many areas, such as access
 to education and civil service jobs and to infrastructure development.
 The 1980 coup mounted by Sergeant Doe and other AFL noncommissioned officers
 was seen by some as a revolution, with indigenous groups taking power from the
 Americo-Liberian elite. However, Doe's authoritarian military-based regime progres-
 sively exacerbated ethnic tensions while subverting the democratic reforms em-
 bodied in the 1985 Constitution.
 During the Doe regime, resentment grew over domination of government by Doe's
 ethnic group, the Krahns. At the height of the civil war, an individual's language
 was used to identify that person's ethnicity. Those from groups considered hostile
 often were summarily executed. The cease-fire in late 1990 stopped many of these
 abuses. However, the NPFL reprisals against Krahns, particularly in Grand Gedeh
 County, and against Mandingos throughout NPFL territory continued to occur. Har-
 assment of rival ethnic groups by predominately Krahn AFL troops in Monrovia and
 Krahn and Mandingo ULIMO fighters continued during the year (see Section 1.g.).

 Religious Minorities.-While religious discrimination is legally prohibited, there
 were claims of discrimination in practice. Muslims, who represent a sizable portion
 of the population, asserted they were subjected to discrimination during the year.
 Alleged mistreatment ranged from unequal access to official radio stations for reli-
 gious programs to bias in government employment practices. On the other hand
 many residents in ULIMO areas complained that ULIMO officials discriminated
 against non-Muslims by exacting higher checkpoint tariffs and business fees. Mus-
 lim representation in senior positions in both IGNU and NPRAG was disproportion-
 ately low. Muslims also asserted that equal sanction and acknowledgment was not
 conferred on Islamic holidays and practices as on Christian ones.  .
 People with Disabilities.-The protracted civil war has produced a large number
 of persons with permanent injuries in addition to persons disabled from other
 causes. There was no de jure discrimination against the disabled. However, in prac-
 tice the disabled did not enjoy equal access to education, employment, and already
 scant social services. Cultural norms also adversely affected attitudes toward the
 disabled population. None of the rival administrations places a high priority on care
 for the disabled, and there are no accessibility laws on the books. Sme N GO and
 U.N. programs in Monrovia were dedicated to rehabilitating and assisting war-
 wounded and otherwise disabled persons.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution states that workers have the right
 to associate in trade unions. The Constitution also states that unions are prohibited
 from partisan political activity, and this restriction has been observed in practice.
 Government interference in union activities, especially elections and leadership con-
 flicts, was commonplace before the war. Over 20 trade unions, representing about
 15 percent of the wage-earning work force, were registered with the Ministry of
 Labor before 1989. Approximately 10 national unions were members of the Liberian
 Federation of Labor Unions (LFLU). However, the actual power the unions exercised
 was always slight.
 Like virtually all other organized activity in the country, unions disappeared dur-
 ing the height of the 1989-90 war. As some large-scale oprations involving rubber
 and other extractive industries began operating in NPFL areas in 1991 and 1992,
 union activity associated with these industries resumed. Economic sanctions and re-
 newed fighting after October 1992 stopped these operations and associated union ac-
 tivity in NPFL territory, but with the signing of the July peace accord, many indus-
 tries planned to resume and affected unions began reorganizing and attempting to
 locate members. In Monrovia union activity focused on internal leadership ques-
 tions, internal financing, and locating suitable employment for members. One of the
 most active organizations was the Ship Workers Union, which urged the Interim
 Government to pressure Liberian flag vessels to employ more Liberian workers.
 However, contending with an 80-percent unemployment rate in Monrovia, this and
 other unions faced an uphill struggle.
 Liberia's status as a beneficiary of trade preferences under the United States'
 Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) program was suspended in 1990 as a re-
 sult of the Doe government's failure to take steps to provide internationally recog-
 nized worker rights. For example, the Doe regime did not recognize the right of civil
 servants or employees of public corporations to unionize or strike. During 1993, at-
 tempts langnis ed in the IGNU legislature to enact an amended labor code remov-
 ing the prohibition against unionization of government workers.
 The 1985 Constitution is silent on the right to strike. While the labor practices
 laws of Liberia do protect this right, the Doe government issued a decree in 1980
 prohibiting strikes. Neither IGNU nor NPRAG officially repealed or affirmed the no-
 strike decree, but it was not challenged in 1993 as there were no significant strikes.
 During the year, neither IGNU nor NPRAG took any di-.riminatory actions against
 organized labor.
 Labor unions traditionally were affiliated with international labor groups before
 the war, and unions attempted to restore many of these ties in 1993.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-With the important exception
 of civil servants, workers (including employees of public corporations and autono-
 mous agencies) have the right to organize and bargain collectively. However, in 1993
 these rights were significantly constrained by the institutional breakdown of unions
 caused by the war and the low level of economic activity. With high unemployment
 and dismissals being fundamental concerns, several unions negotiated with employ-
 er severance payments for union members. Generally, wa e and severance pay
 agreements are negotiated freely between labor and their emloyers without govern-
 ment interference, but with occasional input from the IGNJ or the NPRAG Min-
 istries of Labor.
 
 
 Although the interim legislature deliberated over the merits of a revised labor
 code, neither the Interim Government nor NPRAG took steps to correct flaws high-
 lighted by the 1990 report of the International Labor Organization (ILO). That re-
 port stated that existing labor laws failed to provide workers adequate protection
 against discrimination and reprisals for union activity, failed to protect workers' or-
 ganizations against outside interference, and did not give eligible workers in the
 public sector the opportunity to bargain collectively.
 Labor laws have the same force in Liberia's one export processing zone as in the
 rest of the country.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Constitution prohibits forced
 labor, but even before the civil war this prohibition was widely ignored in rural
 areas where farmers were pressured into providing free labor on "community
 projects" which often benefited only local leaders. Forced labor was used by some
 or all of the warring factions during the civil war, especially for moving equipment
 and supplies. This practice persisted in 1993. NPFL forced labor camps and farms
 in Grand Gedeh County were not reported to have closed. According to several
 sources, the NPFL reportedly used forced labor in western Liberia to move supplies
 in the wake of clashes with ULIMO. When it captured portions of Lofa and Bong
 Counties, ULIMO reportedly forced inhabitants to carry property that had been con-
 fiscated as spoils of war. The AFL also forced civilians to carry its stolen goods.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-Under the Doe government, the
 law prohibited employment of children under age 16 during school hours in the
 wage sector. Enforcement by the Ministry of Labor, however, was limited. Even be-
 fore the civil war, small children continued to assist their parents as vendors in
 local markets and on family subsistence farms. This practice persisted in 1993, par-
 ticularly in those areas where schools had been closed because of the war. During
 the conflict, the NPFL recruited young children as soldiers; many of them had been
 orphaned, and some were less than 12 years of age. Many of these children, espe-
 cially in the NPFL, remained under arms in 1993. (Indeed, the NPFL has a unit
 named the "small boys unit.")
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The labor law provides for a minimum wage,
 paid leave, severance benefits, and safety standards. Before the economy collapsed,
 the legal minimum wage varied according to profession but did not generally pro-
 vide a decent standard of living for a worker and family. (The minimum wage for
 agricultural workers was approximately 90 cents per day, with industrial workers
 receiving three or four times that amount.) Often workers were forced to supple-
 ment their incomes through other activities to maintain a minimal standard of liv.
 ing. Most turned to subsistence farming. The minimum wage was not always been
 enforced adequately by the Labor Ministry.
 The Liberian Labor Code provides for a 48-hour, 6-day regular workweek with a
 30 minute rest period per 5 hours of work. The 6-day workweek may extend to 56
 hours for service occupations and to 72 hours for miners, with overtime pay beyond
 48 hours. In view of the low level of economic activity during 1993, most employers-
 ignored these various regulations, and there was very little attempt at enforcement
 in Monrovia or in NPFL territory.
 Prior to 1990, there also had been government-established health and safety
 standards, enforced in theory by the Ministry of Labor. Workers did not have a spe-
 cifically protected right to remove themselves from dangerous work situations.
