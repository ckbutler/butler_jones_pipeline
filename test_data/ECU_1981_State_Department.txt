 ECUADOR
 On August 10, 1979, Ecuador returned to democratic
 rule after nine years of dictatorship. During 1981
 Ecuador continued to uphold, with few exceptions, rights
 of the person and civil and political rights. No terrorist
 groups operate in Ecuador. Under President Roldos
 (succeeded by Vice President Osvaldo Hurtado when Roldos
 died on May 24, 1981), Ecuador became a vigorous champion
 of human rights within the Andean Pact and Latin America.
 The government is composed of an executive branch,
 a unicameral legislature and an independent judiciary.
 Local government is made up of elected prefects, mayors
 and provincial and municipal councils.
 The president administers the national police through
 the minister of government. Police power is in turn
 delegated to appointed governors (provinces), intendants
 (provinces and municipal jurisdictions), and "political
 lieutenants" (parishes). The latter have the authority
 to arrest and fine in certain casesi their actions
 may be challenged in court.
 Ecuador is a poor country, with a per capita income
 of $1050 (1979 estimate), but approximately 60 percent
 of the population has a per capita income of $330 or
 less per year. Large sectors of the population, particularly
 in rural areas, are not fully integrated into the national
 economic and political life. The Roldos-Hurtado administration
 is carrying out an extensive, long-term development
 plan, the declared object of which is to provide "growth
 with equity."
 1.   Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 The constitution specifically prohibits torture.
 During the border hostilities with Peru in January
 and February 1981, Peruvian authorities charged that
 many Peruvian residents in Ecuador had been arbitrarily
 detained and, in some cases, mistreated or tortured.
 In an atmosphere of war hysteria and invasion fears,
 mistreatment of some Peruvians occurred. While torture
 is believed to be rare, some police brutality at lower
 levels appears to be perceived by the public as normal.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 The constitution specifically prohibits the death penalty
 and inhuman or degrading punishment. There have been
 no recent executions in Ecuador.
 Conditions vary from prison to prison. Facilities
 are generally poor due to limited funds. Some prisoners
 qualify for privileges such as day passes, conjugal
 visits and establishing a business within prison.
 Prison authorities punish prisoners for disciplinary
 reasons; the most commonly alleged punishments are
 beatings and solitary confinement in poorly-ventilated
 (418)
 
 
 419
 underground cells with inadequate sanitary facilities.
 With two exceptions, no Ecuadorean prisons provide
 for effective rehabilitation of prisoners. The women's
 prisons in Quito and Cuenca are administered by the
 Sisters of the Good Shepherd. These nuns organize
 retreats and other activities to rehabilitate prisoners.
 A prisoner's type of conviction, social class, race,
 sex or religion does not affect treatment in prison
 in principle. In practice, however, prisoners with
 money can pay officials to get better conditions.
 c. Disappearances
 People are not abducted, secretly arrested or held
 in clandestine detention by security forces or by any
 other private or official group. The successive murders
 of four suspected criminals in Guayaquil in April 1981
 led to suspicions that off-duty policemen had organized
 a death squad.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 The constitution establishes the right of habeas corpus
 for all citizens. None of the human rights organizations
 in Ecuador has maintained that there are political
 prisoners in the country. A criminal suspect may be
 held without charge for a maximum of 72 hours; there
 is no preventive detention.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Ecuador has a three-tiered court system. The lowest
 tier consists of civil and penal courts, and specialized
 labor relations, housing and transit courts. Second
 are the superior courts located in most of Ecuador's
 20 provinces. The highest level is the supreme court.
 Congress appoints the supreme court judges. These
 judges choose the superior court judges; the latter
 in turn pick the ordinary civil and penal judges and
 the specialized judges. Trial procedures often are
 lengthy; prisoners sometimes wait up to two years between
 arrest and sentencing. Time spent in prison counts
 toward completion of the final sentence. As in most
 civil law countries, judges play central roles in investigation
 as well as in deciding guilt or innocence. Defendants
 have the right of counsel and of not testifying against
 themselves. Lawyers may appeal to the superior and
 supreme courts. Defendants may also ask the constitutional
 guarantees tribunal to investigate allegations of denial
 of constitutional rights (including human rights).
 f. Invasion of the Home
 The Ecuadorean government respects the sanctity of
 the home in theory and in practice. Police require
 a warrant in order to enter a home except in cases
 of hot pursuit. Any judge may issue a warrant.
 2. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 The constitution guarantees freedom of speech and expression.
 However, the penal code establishes punishment for
 persons convicted of slandering government officials.
 Social Christian Party national director Camilo Ponce
 
 
 420
 served three days in prison in January 1981 for slandering
 President Roldos.
 Ecuadorean newspapers are privately owned and free
 of government intervention. There is no media censorship
 or censorship of foreign or domestic books or works
 of art, except for pornography. Opposition to the
 government and criticism of it in the press are tolerated.
 Ecuadorean journalists must belong to the journalists'
 guild in order to practice their profession.
 There is no government interference with academic inquiry
 in the natural or social sciences. The only limit
 on the right of free assembly is that street rallies
 must receive prior consent from the local government.
 This is normally granted.
 Trade unions are organized into three major trade union
 confederations and several minor trade union groups.
 All blue-collar workers, including those employed by
 the government, have the right to organize trade unions,
 to lobby, to bargain collectively, and to strike.
 The Ecuadorean labor code requires considerable government
 involvement in the resolution of labor disputes. The
 Hurtado and Roldos administrations have been sympathetic
 to labor. White collar workers have the right to organize
 and bargain collectively, but do not have the right
 to strike.
 Trade union leaders are elected by the rank-and-file.
 The constitution provides for the formal participation
 of trade unions in government by establishing labor
 representation on the executive boards of the national
 development council, the social security institute,
 the constitutional guarantees tribunal and the labor
 training institute.
 There is no state religion. Ecuadoreans are free to
 practice the religion of their choice. Clergymen may
 not become high-level elected or appointbed officials.
 Foreign missionaries operate freely in Ecuador. However,
 in May 1981 the government gave the Summer Institute
 of Linguistics, which translates the bible into native
 languages, one year's notice to leave Ecuador, in accordance
 with its contract.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel,
 Emigration and Repatriation
 No refugee groups were resettled in Ecuador during
 1981, but numerous exiled politicians from nearby countries
 reside in Ecuador.
 In April 1981, 47 M-19 guerrillas from Colombia, pursued
 by the Colombian army, abandoned their weapons in Colombia
 and sought refuge in Ecuador. The Ecuadorean authorities
 turned them over to the Colombian army. The government
 justified that action, argued by some to have been
 in violation of due process, on national security grounds.
 Ecuadorean citizens and foreign adult residents must
 prove their compliance with income and other tax require-
 ments in order to obtain an exit permit. Ecuadorean
 males also must show they have complied with the military
 service requirement in order to travel abroad. Ecuadoreans
 may emigrate freely, and there are no restrictions
 
 
 421
 on repatriation.
 Neither women nor other groups are subject to discrimi-
 natory rules in matters of internal or foreign travel,
 emigration or repatriation.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Ecuadoreans 18 years of age and over have the right
 to vote by secret ballot. Voting is mandatory for
 literates and voluntary for illiterates. Citizens
 who do not have a valid reason for not voting pay fines.
 All citizens have the right to form and join political
 parties. In order to be legally recognized and able
 to present candidates for public office, a party must
 have a membership greater than 1.5 percent of the total
 number of voters in the most recent national election.
 A party loses its recognition if it fails to receive
 at least five percent of the vote in two successive
 national elections or does not present candidates in
 at least ten provinces.
 There are no ideological prerequisites for forming
 a political party. There are currently 12 certified
 political parties, including one communist party.
 Ecuador held nationwide provincial and municipal elections
 in December 1980. Their fairness was generally acknowledged.
 One of the few women politicians in Ecuador heads the
 Alfarist Radical Front political party. Several women
 have served at the ministerial and under-secretarial
 level in the Roldos and Hurtado administrations. In
 October 1981 the congress ratified the United Nations
 Convention on the Elimination of Discrimination Against
 Women.
 3. Government Attitude and Record Regarding International
 and Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Several human rights organizations exist in Ecuador.
 However, the paucity of human rights violations in
 Ecuador since democratic rule resumed has inclined
 most of these organizations to stress human rights
 concerns outside Ecuador.
 The best known human rights group in Ecuador is the
 Latin American Human Rights Association. Founded in
 August 1980, with assistance from the West German Friedrich
 Ebert Foundation, thus far it has focused exclusively
 upon external human rights situations, particularly
 those elsewhere in Latin America.
 During 1980 President Roldos made it clear that any
 international or non-governmental human rights group
 could investigate the human rights situation in Ecuador.
 No such organization has requested to do so, nor has
 the government entered discussions about the Ecuadorean
 human rights situation with such organizations.
 Under President Roldos, Ecuador became a vociferous
 champion of human rights within the Andean Pact and
 in other parts of Latin America. Roldos was the author
 of the "Riobamba Charter of Conduct" of the Andean
 Pact nations that declared that the defense of human
 rights beyond one country's borders does not constitute
 
 
 422
 a violation of the principle of non-intervention.
 President Hurtado has pledged to follow Roldos' international
 human rights stance.
 4. Economic and Social Circumstances
 Ecuador faces significant challenges in economic and
 social development. Its average per capita income
 was estimated to be $1050 in 1979. Ninety-seven percent
 of the 8,500,000 population resides in the Andean highlands
 and the coast; the remaining three percent resides
 in the Galapagos Islands and the eastern jungle. About
 45 percent of the population is rural. The annual
 population growth rate is estimated to be about 3.3
 per cent. The infant mortality rate declined from
 about 140 per thousand live births in 1960 to about
 66 per thousand in 1978. The average life expectancy
 at birth increased from 57.2 years in 1968 to 62.4
 years in 1979.
 Health care is a problem in Ecuador, despite the relatively
 high life expectancy. Although about 84 percent of
 the urban population has access to clean water, this
 figure drops to 17 percent in rural areas. Calorie
 supply available for consumption relative to nutritional
 requirements was estimated to be 92 percent in 1977.
 About 40 percent of the children under five years of
 age are malnourished. About 40 percent of the urban
 population and 65 percent of the rural population are
 below the absolute poverty level.
 There is an estimated housing deficit of over 800,000
 units (including existing substandard units). On the
 average, nationally, about 2.5 persons occupy each
 room.
 Adult literacy in 1974 was estimated to be about 78
 percent for males and 70 percent for females. Adult
 literacy in some isolated rural areas is as low as
 30 percent. The current government ias embarked on
 a literacy program that reached 205,000 illiterates
 in 1980.
 The Ecuadorean government is attempting to improve
 the social and economic conditions of the majority
 of Ecuadoreans through a five-year development plan
 from 1979 to 1984. The government is particularly
 interested in low-income housing and in integrated
 rural development. In addition, 1981 legislation extended
 social security and medical coverage to the campesinos,
 estimated to be about 36 percent of the population.
 Women enjoy the same constitutional rights and privileges
 as men in all aspects of public and private life.
 Both men and women may file for a civil divorce. Culture,
 rather than law, is responsible for women's second-
 class status. Urban women usually gain employment
 as secretaries, teachers, clerks or servants. Statistics
 on the employment of women are generally unavailable,
 but it appears that women are paid less than men in
 comparable positions, and are underrepresented in the
 technical, medical and legal professions, and in high-
 level government positions. It appears that women
 in the upper and middle classes are making some progress.
 About 12.2 percent of executive positions or heads
 of business are women. Female enrollment in institutions
 of higher learning rose to over 80,000 in 1979, about
 35 percent of the total. Women in the lower class
 who have emigrated from the countryside are in the
 worst position, lacking education or good employment
 prospects and frequently having to care for several
 children.
 The inflation rate for 1980 was about 16.7 percent.
 Unemployment was about 10 percent, but the government
 estimated underemployment at about 50 percent.
