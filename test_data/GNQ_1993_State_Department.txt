 EQUATORIAL GUINEA
 Nominally since 1991 Equatorial Guinea has had a constitutional democratic gov-
 ernment with judicial integrity and multiparty elections for national offices. The re-
 ality is that President Obiang, in power since 1979, and a small group of his associ-
 ates dominate the executive, legislative, and judiciary, and make no meaningful dis-
 tinction among the branches of government or its party, the Democratic Party of
 Equatorial Guinea (DPEG). Fraudulent legislative elections took place in November
 with the DPEG winning 68 seats out of 80 in the National Assembly. Boycotting
 the elections were the main opposition parties and an estimated 60 to 80 percent
 of the potential voters. The new Cabinet was made up exclusively of DPEG mem-
 bers and was expanded from 34 to 42 portfolios.
 As the country's senior military officer, Head of State, and government-party
 chief, Brigadier General Obiang also dominates the military and police. Obiang's
 brother, Amengol Ondo Nguema, heads the security apparatus, which is respon-
 sible for frequent and severe human rights violations, usually inflicted to intimidate
 the population. The authorities took no meaningful action against any security force
 member accused of human rights violations. The large Moroccan Presidential Guard
 in country since 1979 departed in August, leaving an estimated 20 Moroccan police
 to provide protection for the President. A French-trained and -equipped special force
 of 200-250 persons, raised largely from Mongomo youth (Obiang's area), replaced
 the Moroccan Presidential Guard.
 Equatorial Guineans live increasingly by subsistence agriculture as well as tradi-
 tional hunting and fishing. The small monetary sector, based on export of petro-
 leum, timber, and cocoa, and heavily subsidized by foreign assistance, has recovered
 somewhat from the devastation of the Macias era (1968-1979) but is far short of
 reindependence levels. The Government failed to implement needed economic re-
 orms, and as a result, the International Monetary Fund in August suspended an
 enhanced structural adjustment program agreed to in January. Pervasive corruption
 stifles private sector development and discourages legitimate investment from
 abroad. The grat majority of the population goes without potable water, electricity,
 even minimal health care, or basic education.
 The overall human rights performance deteriorated dramatically. Despite the his-
 toric agreement in March on a National Pact between the Government and opposi-
 tion parties for political reform, and despite its public promises of an open and free
 electoral process, the Government continued to repress perceived opposition and to
 control the outcome of the legislative elections. There were extrajudicial killings by
 the security forces-in numbers unknown since the 1970's-and numerous arbitrary
 arrests, short-term detentions, and extensive instances of physical abuse of per.
 ceived antigovcrnment elements. Where prosecution was desired, the Government
 
 
 81
 used military tribunals which failed to meet minimum international standards for
 fair trial. The regime also attempted intimidation against foreign diplomats, includ-
 ing expulsion of the Spanish Consul General at Bata as well as thinly veiled threats
 by the regime against the Ambassadors of Spain and the United States.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were at least six politically
 motivated killings, the highest number in the 14 years since Obiang came to power.
 Four of the deaths were opposition party members and two were members of a mi-
 nority group protesting government repression on the remote island of Annobon.
 The Government did not investigate seriously any of the incidents.
 Police detained Damaso Abaga Nve, an activist in the Popular Union Party (PU),
 without warrant in late March in Ebebiyin, the capital of Kie Ntiem province in the
 continental portion of Equatorial Guinea. According to credible sources, he died dur-
 ing the night of March 30 after police beat him severely. A committee appointed by
 the compliance commission, established by the National Pact, investigated and re-
 ported that Abaga had been illegally detained on oral orders from a senior local offi-
 cial, that he had died as the result of head injuries inflicted by the police while in
 custody, and that senior authorities had attempted to cover up the truth of his
 death. Not having prosecutorial authority, the commission called on the Government
 to investigate and take appropriate legal actions. The Government did not follow up,
 claiming Nve had been found dead after his release from detention.
 Similarly, police detained arbitrarily Gaspar Mba Oyono, a PU activist, and sev-
 eral others without warrant in late June in the district capital of Nsok Nsomo, Kie
 Ntiem province. According to credible reports, he was extensively tortured during
 5 days. Because of massive internal hemorrhaging, upon release Mba's family took
 him to the Kie Ntiem provincial hospital at Ebebiyin where he died 4 days later.
 The Government did not acknowledge the death to be related to mistreatment dur-
 indetention.
 n August 22, security personnel, led by a cabinet member, forced their entry nto
 the hotel room of Moises Andres Mba Ada, the leader of the Popular Union Party
 who had returned from long exile the previous day, and apprehended Pedro Motu
 Mamiaga, a longtime PU political activist. Motu had spent years in prison during
 both the Macias and Obiang regimes and had returned from exile in late July.
 When Motu demanded to see a written order for his detention, police severely beat
 him by blows from rifle butts as well as kicks and punches as the arresting team
 attempted to force him into a police car. Motu's cries of alarm and struggle attracted
 the attention of numerous passersby, and eyewitnesses reported that Motu was se-
 verely injured during his arrest and removal. He died during the night while in cus-
 tody as a result of severe further torture by Secretary of State for National Security
 Manuel Nguemba Mba. The Government announced the next day that Motu had ad-
 mitted to being the leader of a plot to overthrow the Government and kill Obiang,
 and, out of remorse, had committed suicide. However, the Government refused to
 return the remains to the family, buried him at an unknown site, and provided no
 written evidence that Motu was involved in a plot or medical proof that he had com-
 mitted suicide (see also Section i.e.).
 On August 28 near the town of Bata, four youths had a nonpolitical altercation
 with Romualdo Rafael Nsogo, an activist in the Convergence for Social Democracy
 (CFDS). Nsogo claimed he defended himself with a knife, killing one and wounding
 another. Despite its lack of jurisdiction in the matter, a military tribunal on Sep-
 tember 18 took I day to convict Nsogo of first degree murder, and a military firing
 squad executed him the following day (see Section i.e.).
 On August 13, on the remote island of Annobon, the local security detachment
 used excessive force in handling an incident in which a number of the island's
 youths, protesting economic conditions on the island, held hostage the island's Gov-
 ernor and military commander. In the assault, the security forces killed an innocent
 bystander, Sim plicio Llorente Yaye, and later shot and killed one of the young activ-
 ists, Manuel Villarrubia, as he attempted to escape. The authorities arrested 21 oth-
 ers, many of whom had taken no part in the holding of the officials, and the security
 forces, according to credible reports, tortured some of the detainees before taking
 them to Bata, where they were tried by a military tribunal for rebellion and sup-
 porting Annoben's secession from Equatorial Guinea (see Section i.e.). Eight were
 convicted in a 1-day trial in September, but they were pardoned in October; the
 other 15 were released without charge but were not returned to Annobon.
 b. Disappearance.-Thtre were no documented disappearances. However, families
 were often at a loss for days to locate and conitact relatives who had been
 
 
 82
 extrajudicially detained. This was particularly true of active duty and former mili-
 tary personnel held at military camps.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Police and other security forces continued routinely to administer torture and other
 cruel forms of mistreatment to prisoners. Authorities employed a wide variety of
 techniques, including severe beatings, electric shock, pouring irritants such as diesel
 fuel on the skin, an hanging trussed victims from poles and wall hooks. In the case
 of perceived enemies of the Government, the primary motives for physical and psy-
 chological torture often appeared to be to punish and intimidate more than to inter-
 rogate or gain confessions.
 Police often detained known or suspected opposition supporters only long enough
 to administer a beating. A common punishment session involved 50 or 75 strokes
 with a rubber truncheon or short length of electrical power cable on the soles of the
 feet, back, buttocks, or other parts of the body. Police also employed truncheon
 blows over the kidneys, leaving short-term hemorrhaging and possible permanent
 damage, blows to thehead, an open-handed slaps over ear openings causing excru-
 ciating pain and in some cases leaving permanent injury.
 In one well documented case, in January the Government arrested three well-
 known politicians returning from abroad: Benamin-Gabriel Balinga Alene, Sec-
 retary General of the Social Democratic Party (SDP); Antonio Ebang Mbele, Presi-
 dent of the Democratic Progressive Alliance (DPA); and Estanislau Don Malavo, a
 senior adviser in the Liberal Party (LP). The Government announced to the public
 over television and radio and to the diplomatic corps by formal note that the three
 had attempted to enter the country clandestinely at an unauthorized crossing point
 near Ebebiyin, when in fact they presented themselves for inspection at the
 Ebebiyin entry point. Despite assurances to the public and foreign diplomats of fair
 treatment, the authorities took detainees to Bats where they underwent several
 hours of torture which included truncheon blows to the lower back and to the soles
 of the feet, followed by being forced to jump up and down. Ten months following
 the incident, the three still suffered; Don Malavo, in particular, suffered from kidney
 damage.
 In the trial of the nine active duty or former military members (see Section i.e.),
 all of the accused had been tortured following their arrests in August. At the trial,
 according to a reliable source, it was apparent that Sergeant Jacinto Nculu Abaga
 had been so recently tortured that he could not gesture with either hand; his face
 was marked; and he walked unsteadily, likely the result of blows to his ears affect-
 ing balance and coordination.
 Prison conditions continued to be extremely harsh and life threatening, but no
 deaths were attributed directly to those conditions. With no professional medical at-
 tention, no hygiene facilities in the holding cells beyond slop cans, and limited food
 for prisoners, families or friends must take food to detainees in the morning and
 evening. Female prisoners are not singled out for rape or mistreatment, but women
 risoners are not securely separated from men. In October the prison authorities
 kept the 49 prisoners at Bata, including 3 women, locked in their cells for all but
 two short periods at dawn and sundown. In December at the main police station
 in Bata, 28 persons-1 opposition activist and 27 university students, including 5
 women and 1 Roman Catholic priest-were confined and tortured for a week in a
 single room without sanitary facilities.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Despite constitutional provisions, there
 was little enforcement of the rights of persons in detention to be charged or released
 within a reasonable period of time, to have access to a lawyer, or tobe released on
 bail. Arbitrary arrests in nonpolitical cases by national security forces were com-
 monplace, often on spurious charges, in order to extort money or to gain personal
 revenge. Non-Guinean Africans-mainly petty traders from Nigeria, Cameroon, and
 Ghana-were often targets of extortion by regime agents. Detainees were frequently
 held incommunicado.
 The number of known detainees at any one time does not reflect the many more
 who passed through police and special forces custody for brief periods of time. Many
 detainees were physically mistreated, administratively fined by their captors, and
 released without being arraigned before a court. During the National Pact negotia-
 tions in February, the opposition produced a list of 64 names of political detainees,
 none of whom had been processed in the civil courts; most of them were released
 by April. During widespread detentions in August, the number of political detainees
 probably exceeded 100 for a time. Banishment to home villages--for which there is
 no legal provision--continued to be used against perceived political opponents, par-
 ticularly former members of the security forces. Following legislative elections in
 November, more than 100 persons were detained for various periods, allegedly for
 offenses ranging from holding political meetings to promoting the boycott of the elec-
 
 
 83
 tions. These detentions for the most part took place in rural towns and villages of
 the continental portion of the country.
 The number of political and security prisoners held at the end of 1993 was ap-
 roximately 50; perhaps as many as 500 politically inspired detentions took place
 during the year.
 While the Government officially welcomes back exiles, it did not evidence a seri-
 ous interest in promoting their return or offering support once back home. The ma-
 jority of returned exiles are considered by the Government to be political enemies
 and, as a result, were unable to obtain government employment-despite qualifica-
 tions-or to engage in the private sector without harassment. Discouraged and in
 some cases intimidated by detentions, several former exiles who had returned since
 1992 and had became active in politics went abroad again.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-There is no effective separation between the exec-
 utive and the judiciary. All personnel of the judicial system, from clerks to Supreme
 Court justices, serve at the pleasure of the President. The executive branch acts
 with little respect for judicial independence.
 There is a formal court structure with the Supreme Court at the apex, and also
 military and customary (traditional) court systems. Traditional laws and customs
 are honored when not in conflict with national law. The Council provided for in the
 Constitution to decide constitutional issues was established in 1993; of its five mem-
 bers, only three-including the Chief Justice-are fully trained lawyers.
 The nation's mixture of traditional law, military law, and Franco-era Spanish
 rules and procedures results in an inconsistent system of justice, but one which the
 Government evinced little serious interest in reforming. Corruption is pervasive, in
 part because judges and court officials are poorly paid and trained. Appellate pro-
 ceedings are virtually nonexistent. Defendants unable to afford legal counsel stand
 little chance of acquittal. With perhaps 5 notable exceptions, most of the country's
 few lawyers (approximately 36) depend on their connections to the regime for a live-
 lihood, raising questions about their impartiality toward defendants.
 In a clear trend during 1993, the Government preferred not to bring political
 cases before the civilian court system, relying instead on short-term detentions to
 intimidate its critics. Where trials were seen as useful politically, the authorities
 employed military tribunals even for civilian defendants or conducted unfair civilian
 proceedings.
 Military tribunals heard three cases in September which did not meet inter-
 national standards of fair trial. On September 11 in Bats, a military tribunal took
 1 day to hear the case against 23 Annobonese civilians (2 in absentia) for attempt-
 ing to overthrow the State (see Section L.a.). With no qualified attorneys represent-
 ing the accused, the military tribunal sentenced the two who had led the protest,
 Orlando Cartegena Lagar and Francisco Medina Catalan, to 28 years in prison and
 six others to 20 years in prison. It released the other 15 individuals but did not per-
 mit their return to Annobon. Subsequently, in celebration of the 25th anniversary
 of independence, on October 11 Obiang pardoned the eight condemned Annobonese.
 He simultaneously promoted 14 security force members who had participated in the
 August killings and torture on Annobon.
 A military tribunal on September 17 found Romualdo Rafael Nsogo, a member of
 the opposition CPDS, guilty of first degree murder. A military firing squad executed
 him the next day (see Section L.a.). Guinean civil law experts said that the process
 flagrantly violated the country's legal standards as the military had no jurisdiction
 over an all-civilian matter, that Nsgo did not have trained defense counsel, that
 the defendant did not have the right of appeal, and that the death sentence was
 not confirmed by another court as required in capital cases. Nsogo would likely have
 been processed in a civil court on a lesser charge had it not been for his membership
 in the opposition party.
 On September 23-24, in a case that grew out of the conspiracy claimed by the
 Government to have involved Pedro Motu Mamiaga (see Section l.a.), a closed mili-
 tary tribunal in Malabo tried nine active duty andformer military members for con-
 spiracy, rebellion, and defaming and insulting the Head of State. The military court
 found the accused guilty, including Sergeant Jacinto Nculu Abaga, who received 24
 years in prison. The only accused represented by a qualified lawyer, a civilian, was
 released.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-Al-
 though required by the Constitution, search warrants are not used. The regime fre-
 quently places under surveillance persons it deems suspicious. Many believe tele-
 phone conversations are routinely monitored. There is systematic interference with
 correspondence, and there were three attempts by the Government to inspect seatcd
 diplomatic pouches of Spain and the United States.
 
 
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech
 and press. However, in practice, neither exists.
 Most citizens are compelled to practice self-censorship of political expression. Any
 vocal dissenter or associate of a dissenter puts at risk employment, access to public
 services, and even life. For a time in 1993, the regime relaxed its usual heavy media
 censorship of dissent. The political opposition appeared nightly on television during
 the February-March National Pact negotiations. However, following its signing, the
 government-controlled media reverted to featuring the party of the regime and em-
 hasizing the personality cult of the President as the sole benefactor of the country.
 pposition voices that gained occasional access to television after March were dis-
 sidents within parties reflecting intraparty bickering and those parties which had
 come to terms with the Government to participate in the flawedpelectoral process.
 The security apparatus usually equates criticism of the regime with treason; and
 tries to prevent distribution of printed materials unfavorable to the regime. There
 is no free press.
 The controlled media consistently reported on alleged international plots to back
 opposition parties and of efforts to destabilize the Government. The principal targets
 for these claims were Spain and the United States which were accused of working
 in concert with the three main opposition parties-the Party of Progress (PP), Popu-
 lar Union, and the Convergence for Social Democracy.
 Academic freedom is nonexistent.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The right of assembly and as-
 sociation is provided for in the Constitution. However, any gathering of more than
 10 persons for discussions that the regime considers political, even in private homes,
 is illegal without permission.
 Legalized opposition ptrties experienced difficulty in holding even private meet-
 ings outside of the capital. Contrary to the law, security officials routinely ignore
 or deny requests by the opposition to hold public meetings, and even when approved
 there usually is harassment from security and other officials, particularly outside
 the capital. None of the opposition's dozen or so public meetings was iven media
 coverage. However, the political party of the regime, the DPE  held hundreds of
 public and in-house meetings which were given daily coverage in the media.
 On August 21, the prominent leader of the Popular Union, Andres Moises Mba
 Ada, returned to Malabo from 12 years in exile. His return witnessed an unprece-
 dented show of popular support as several thousand people appeared at the airport
 and along the highway into town. Later a few hundred were gathered peaceably out-
 side party headquarters when security forces arrived and without warning violently
 disburse the crowd with truncheons and rifle butts, detaining over 30 and injuring
 a number of others who required hospitalization. The regime claimed the crowd was
 blocking the street.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-Equatorial Guinea does not have an official state religion,
 and freedom of religion is generally respected, though ministers of religion are pro-
 hibited by law from being members of parties or making statements critical of re-
 gime officials or institutions.
 Christianity, mainly Roman Catholicism, is the predominant reliion, often inter-
 spersed with traditional religious practices. The Islamic and Baha i faiths are also
 practiced openly. Jehovah's Witnesses was officially recognized as a legally inscribed
 religion in January 1994. Even prior to recognition, Witnesses had been able to open
 a center in Malabo and hold regular services. Proselytizing by Protestant denomina-
 tions and construction of new churches were also permitted. Foreign clergy and mis-
 sionaries continue to have an active role in education and health.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.--Contrary to the Constitution and specific commitments by the Govern-
 ment with the opposition in the March National Pact, movement within the country
 by opposition politicians was routinely impeded by authorities; assports were rou-
 tinely confiscated; and exit visas, required for nationals as welfas oreigners, rou-
 tinely denied, not only to perceived opponents but to their families as well, including
 for medical treatment abroad. Transportation aboard the government-owned aircraft
 and passenger ship was occasionally denied to opposition politicians, who reportedly
 were told the transportation was for government-party loyalists only.
 Other citizens generally may travel freely within the country. However, poorly
 trained and paid police often extort payments for passage through traffic check-
 points on maor roads.
 There are in general restrictions on travel abroad, including lengthy delays in ob-
 taining passports and the required exit permit. Many citizens leave the country
 without formal documentation for both economic and political reasons to reside
 abroad, mostly in Gabon, Cameroon, Spain, and France. The principal receiving
 
 
 country was Gabon, where an estimated 100,000-135,000 Guineans have settled
 over the years.
 There was one political refugee living in Equatorial Guinea who had been docu-
 mented by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 President Obiang remains the source of political power. Citizens do not have the
 right to change their government by democratic means. There have been no free
 elections since 1968. All government employees--judges, legislators, mayors, civil
 servants, and security forces-serve at the pleasure of the President.
 While President Obiang's political party, the Democratic Party of Equatorial
 Guinea (DPEG), is no longer the sole legal party, it continued to monopolize the po-
 litical system. Obiang acknowledged in July that the DPEG was supported by public
 funds. The DPEG continued to receive dues from all government employees, includ-
 ing employees in state-owned enterprises, in violation of agreements made by the
 Government in the National Pact.
 In the legislative elections in November, 8 of the 13 legalized opposition political
 parties as well as the United Nations and most of the international community,
 concluded a priori that the electoral process--from voter registration to vote count-
 ing-lacked minimal standards of fairness. While there was no violence during the
 elections, there were widespread indications of irregularities committed by the Gov-
 ernment, including multiple voting by individuals, vote padding, and miscounting.
 The Constitution does not require presidential elections until 1996.
 Women and minorities are seriously underrepresented in the political process. In
 1993, for the first time, a number of women opposition members became outspoken
 about the regime's excesses and the need for peaceful change following the
 extrajudicial death of political activist Pedro Motu Mamiaga in August. In Novem-
 ber, 3 women, all of the Government's party, won seats in the 80-member legisla-
 ture. This is down from the 8 who sat in the previous 60-member body. Two women
 were appointed to the 34-member Cabinet, as the Minister and the Vice Minister
 for Women's and Social Affairs. There is one woman judge in the judiciary, a small
 scattering of women among the senior levels of the Civil Service, and a handful of
 women in noncommissioned and junior-service ranks of the security services.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 There are no local, nongovernmental human rights groups; none would be per-
 mitted to criticize openly the Government's human rights abuses. The Equatorial
 Guinean Human Rights Commission formed in 1991 by President Obiang remained
 dormant.
 The President rejected out of hand the annual report on human rights in Equa-
 torial Guinea prepared by the United Nations Human Rights Commission's
 (UNHRC) special rapporteur Fernando Volio Jimenez. As has been the case since
 the first UNHRC-approved plan of action made in 1980 by Professor Volio, the Gov-
 ernment did not respond to, or act upon, recommendations approved at the Commis-
 sion's annual meeting in March.
 The Government did permit the newly-appointed UNHRC Special Rapporteur,
 Alejandro Artucio, and human rights consultant Eduardo Duhal de to visit in Octo-
 ber and December. While the two had wide contact with the general public, visited
 the two main prisons, and called on President Obiang, few members of the Govern-
 ment were willing to receive them.
 A special U.N. mission and two pairs of U.N. expert consultants traveled to Equa-
 torial Guinea in April and July to assess the electoral process as well as the human
 rights situation. However, the Government rejected virtually all recommendations
 and offers of assistance extended by the United Nations and supported by the resi-
 dent donor community.
 The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) continued to visit Equa-
 torial Guinea regularly but apparently did not reach agreement with the Govern-
 ment on prisoner visitation programs. Amnesty International maintained close
 watch through in-country contacts and published extensively on the human rights
 situation.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 Women.-Although the Constitution and laws provide for equal rights for women,
 they are largely confined by custom to traditional roles, especially in agriculture. Po-
 lygyny, which is widespread among the Fang, contributes to the secondary status
 accorded women by society. According to U.N. data, females receive only one-fifth
 
 
 as much schooling as males. The Ministry for the Promotion of Women focuses on
 agriculture, handicrafts, and vocational and semiprofessional training. It is inter-
 ested in developing women's agricultural cooperatives and enrolling more women in
 the country's postsecondary schools.
 There is discrimination against women regarding inheritance and family laws. For
 an estimated 90 percent of the women in the country-i.e., virtually all ethnic
 groups except the Bubi-tradition dictates that if a marriage is dissolved, the
 woman must return the dowry given her family by the bridegroom at the time of
 marriage and the husband automatically receives custody of all children from the
 union. Similarly, in the Fang, Ndowe, and Bisio cultures, primogeniture is practiced
 and, as women become members of their husband's families upon marriage, they are
 usually not accorded inheritance rights. In theory, women may buy and sell prop-
 erty as well as goods, but in practice the male-dominated society permits few
 women to have access to sufficient funds to engage in more than petty trading or
 to purchase real property beyond a garden plot or modest home.
 Violence against women, particularly wife beating, is common, according to medi-
 cal professionals.
 Children.-The Government has given little attention to children's welfare issues,
 and there are no groups that specilically address the needs of children. Child abuse
 is uncommon.
 National/Racial /Ethnic Minorities.-Although the law provides for equal treat-
 ment for all citizens, all ethnic groups are not granted the same rights and privi-
 leges. The Fang comprise 83 percent of the population, the Bubi 10 percent, and
 other   ups-primarily closely related to the Fang-the remainder. A small num-
 ber of Fang clans, especially those of the President and relatives by marriage, domi-
 nate all aspects of the regime as well as the economy and social life. Discrimination
 against the Bubi and Fernandino of Bioko Island, the Annobonese, and the Ndowe
 and associated coastal groups from the continent, is consistent, whether in the
 granting of political office or the approval of academic scholarships.
 Although all ethnic groups were represented in the Cabinet, only Fang occupied
 positions of real power. Following the November elections, the expanded (from 60
 to 80 seats) legislature and the enlarged (from 34 to 42 members) Cabinet diluted
 the number and potential influence of minorities in those bodies. Virtually all mem-
 bers of the security forces, as well as the presidential household, are Fang, and all
 policy and command positions in government are dominated by the President's clos-
 est ethnic associates from Mongomo.
 For the first time since independence in 1968, a minority ethnic group made its
 political presence felt. An underground Bubi-interest group emerged shortly before
 the November elections and publicly demanded a referendum on the island's inde-
 pendence. Calling itself the "Movement for the Self-Determination of Bioko Island"
 (MSBI), the group spearheaded an electoral abstention rate estimated at 90-95 per-
 cent among the Bubi, the island's largest ethnic group.
 People with Disabilities.-There is no constitutional or legal provision for the
 physically disabled with respect to discrimination in employment, education, or pro-
 vision of other state services. The Government has not enacted legislation mandat-
 ing accessibility for the disabled.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The right to organize unions is provided for in the
 Constitution. However, no enabling legislation has been passed, and in the small
 wage-economy no labor organizations exist, although there are a few cooperatives
 with limited power. Strikes are prohibited by law. There is a Labor Code which
 aims to uphold the dignity of the worker, but it is not generally enforced.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-There is no legislation regard-
 ing these rights or addressing antiunion discrimination and no evidence of collective
 bargaining by any group. Wages are set by the Government and the employers, with
 little or no input by workers. The employer must meet the minimum wage set by
 the Government, and most companies pay above the government established mini-
 mum. The Labor Code has served as a useful law in the mediation of selected cases
 involving compensation to discharged workers.
 There are no export processing or free trade zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced labor and slavery are pro-
 hibited by law, and slavery does not exist. However, numerous convicted prisoners
 and persons detained without formal charges perform day labor in households and
 businesses, on farms, and at residential construction sites of senior officials, includ-
 ing the presidential household. There is no monetary compensation for forced labor,
 although two meals a day are accorded some household help. The workweek is often
 7 days for prison laborers.
 
 
 87
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The legal minimum age for em-
 ployment is 16, but there is no enforcement of this law. Children younger than 16
 commonly assist rural families with agricultural production and in town in street
 vending.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-There is only a small industrial sector in the
 country. Most salaried employment is provided by the Government, construction
 companies, businesses providing retail goods and services, and the plantation agri-
 cultural sector.
 A sliding scale of minimum wages was established in 1990. Entry-level positions
 begin at approximately $47 (CFA 14,000) per month. However, the minimum wage
 law is not widely enforced, and agricultural workers frequently receive less than
 prescribed by law. Government employees are explicitly exempted from the mini-
 mum wage law's provisions. The minimum wage by itself does not provide a worker
 and family with a decent living, and most of those with regular salaried income
 have to supplement their earnings with income from other sources or by farming.
 The law limits the regular workweek to 48 hours and guarantees employees 1 24-
 hour rest period per week, plus regularly scheduled national holidays. The Labor
 Code offers comprehensive protection for workers from occupational hazards, but the
 Ministry of Labor does not effectively enforce the standards. Safety and health com-
