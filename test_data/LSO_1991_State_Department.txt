 LESOTHO
 Lesotho has been ruled by a six-member Military Council since a
 coup d'etat in 1986 which overthrew the single-party rule of
 Prime Minister Leabua Jonathan. The Council Chairman, Major
 General J. M. Lekhanya, was ousted on April 30, 1991, in an
 internal struggle which caused the dismissal of another Council
 member and the firing of two civilian members of the Cabinet.
 Colonel (now Major General) Elias Phisoana Ramaema was chosen
 by fellow officers in the armed forces to become the new
 Military Council Chairman. Sworn in on May 3, the new Council
 of Ministers is comprised of seven military officers and seven
 civilians; there are two civilian assistant ministers.
 The Military Council rules by decree, while the Council of
 Ministers administers the day-to-day operations of government.
 Shortly after assuming office, Council Chairman Ramaema lifted
 the 1986 ban on partisan political activity and reaffirmed
 plans to restore constitutional rule--abolished in 1970 by
 former Prime Minister Jonathan--by 1992. The National
 Constituent Assembly, first convened in mid-1990, completed its
 revisions to the 1966 independence Constitution in early July
 and met again in late September to establish a constitutional
 commission to solicit public comments on the revised text,
 prior to final ratification of the document.
 The Royal Lesotho Defense Force (RLDF) of about 2,000 troops is
 responsible for internal and border security. The RLDF is
 assisted by a police force of about 1,600 men and women.
 Members of both forces occasionally beat or otherwise mistreat
 detainees.
 A landlocked country completely surrounded by South Africa,
 Lesotho is almost entirely dependent on its sole neighbor for
 trade, finance, employment, and access to the outside world.
 Approximately 55 percent of the adult male labor force is
 employed in South Africa's mines, and remittances from workers
 (more than $230 million in 1988) are a critical factor in
 financing imports. Economic recession in South Africa has led
 to retrenchments in the mines and a sharp rise in unemployment
 in Lesotho.
 Human rights in Lesotho in 1991 remained circumscribed under
 the military government, but certain aspects of the situation
 improved over previous years. There was some progress toward
 political and constitutional reform and in increased freedom of
 speech, assembly, and association. However, police brutality
 continued, and the security forces used excessive force in
 quelling anti-Asian riots in May, in which many persons were
 killed. No charges were brought against those responsible.
 Other major problems included provisions for lengthy detention
 and severe restrictions on women's rights. At year's end, it
 was still too early to tell how the Government's reform program
 would be implemented, whether it would, in fact, result in
 citizens' ability to change their government, and what effect
 it would have on the observance of other human rights.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 Some extrajudicial killings continued to occur. Excesses by
 law enforcement agencies continued, including fatal shootings
 
 
 191
 LESOTHO
 in May by police and army personnel attempting to quell violent
 anti-Asian riots which broke out in Maseru and spread to other
 towns in the western lowlands. Official figures put the death
 toll at 25; other reports indicated as many as 80 or more may
 have lost their lives. No charges are known to have been
 brought in those instances.
 In mid-March judgment was handed down by the Chief Justice of
 the High Court in the trial of two military men accused of the
 1986 murders of two former cabinet ministers and their wives.
 Sergeant Ngoana-ngoana Lerotholi was found guilty of murder,
 and Colonel Sekhobe Letsie (a former member of the ruling
 Military Council) was found guilty as an accessory after the
 fact. Both received several concurrent sentences, with Sgt.
 Lerotholi given the death sentence (see Section i.e.).
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reports of politically related disappearances in
 1991, nor were there any further instances of reported
 abductions by South African authorities in Lesotho, as occurred
 in previous years.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Reports of police brutality, including beatings of detainees,
 continued during 1991. There were a disturbing number of
 reports of random beatings of civilians by police or military
 personnel, especially in the immediate aftermath of the
 violence in late May. No known investigations or other
 official measures were launched as a result of these
 practices. Prison facilities in Lesotho-are overcrowded and in
 need of repair. One report indicated a prisoner was held in a.
 bathroom ankle-deep in water because all available cells were
 occupied.-
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention; or Exile,
 In civil and criminal cases,'persons arrested or detained have,
 and avail themselves of, the rightto immediate consideration
 of habeas corpus appeals as well as the right to legal and
 medical counsel. The 1981 Criminal Procedures and Evidence
 Act, as amended'in 1984, makes provision for the granting of
 bail. Under the Act, the High Court is the only judicial body
 empowered to grant bail in cases of armed robbery or suspected
 homicide.
 The Internal Security (General) Act (ISA) of 1984 provides for
 so-called investigative detention without charge or trial in
 political cases for up to 42 days (the first 14 days on order
 of the-police; the second 14 days on order of the police
 commissioner; and the final 14 days on order of the Minister of
 Defense and Internal Security). During the second'stage of the
 detention, ministerially appointed "advisers" (all of whom have
 been government employees to date) are available to report on
 the health of the detainee, investigate whether the detainee
 has been involved in subversive activities, and advise the
 Minister of Defense and Internal Security whether there is a
 need for continued detention. Detainees under the Act may make
 representation about their own treatment only through the
 adviser. The Act also allows for detention of witnesses in
 security cases.
 
 
 192
 LESOTHO
 In addition, a 1986 amendment to the ISA allows the Minister of
 Defense and Internal Security (currently the Chairman of the
 Military Council) to "restrict" a person who, in the opinion of
 the police commissioner, is conducting himself in a manner
 prejudicial to public order, security, administration of
 justice, or obedience to the law or lawful authority. In
 mid-1991 former Military Council Chairman Lekhanya was first
 limited to an 8-kilometer radius from his home near Maseru and
 then restricted to the bounds of the property itself. No
 reasons were made public for imposition of the latter
 restriction in August, nor for its removal in September.
 An independent journalist, Johnny wa ka Maseko, who was
 expelled from Lesotho in 1988 for printing reports alleging
 high-level corruption, was allowed to return to the country in
 July following the change of government in early May. A South
 African lawyer, who was expelled in 1986, has also been
 permitted to return to Lesotho and has resumed his law practice
 in Maseru.
 Following his dispute with the Military Council in February
 1990 and his subsequent exile in London, ex-King Moshoeshoe II
 remained outside the country throughout 1991. The relaxation
 of restrictions on political activity in mid-May opened the way
 for a proroyalist party to advocate publicly for the former
 King's return, and an active debate on the issue took place in
 the opposition press. The Government has repeatedly said the
 former monarch may return, as a private citizen, without other
 conditions.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The judiciary consists of the Court of Appeal (which meets
 semiannually), the High Court, magistrate's courts, and
 customary or traditional courts, which exist largely in rural
 areas to administer customary law. Judges on the High Court
 are relatively independent; however, the Chief Justice, an
 expatriate who serves a 2-year appointment, may be under some
 pressure to act in ways that will ensure reappointment.
 Magistrates appear more susceptible to governmental influence.
 Court decisions and rulings are respected by the authorities
 and are generally free of interference by the executive.
 Accused persons have and use the right to counsel and public
 trials. The courts have acted to limit infringements of law on
 numerous occasions in past years, e.g., the April 1988
 annulment on procedural grounds of the State of Emergency,
 which, however, the Government quickly reinstituted.
 Under the system of Roman-Dutch law applied in Lesotho, there
 is no trial by jury. Criminal trials are normally adjudicated
 by a single High Court judge who presides with two assessors,
 who serve in an advisory capacity. In civil cases, judges
 normally hear cases alone. The High Court also provides
 procedural and substantive advice and guidance on matters of
 legal procedure to military tribunals; however, it does not
 participate in arriving at judgments. Military tribunals have
 jurisdiction only over military cases.
 A judicial inquest may be initiated by the Attorney General on
 the authority of the Judicial Inquest Proclamation Number 32 of
 1954. In November 1989, he initiated such an inquiry into the
 1986 slayings of two former cabinet ministers and their wives.
 In March 1991, the High Court ruled on murder charges against
 two senior soldiers accused of these killings, finding one
 guilty of murder and the other tuilty as an accessory after the
 
 
 193
 LESOTHO
 fact. The case was heard in open court by the Chief Justice
 (who ruled on matters of law), accompanied by two civilian
 assessors (who ruled with him on matters of fact). Public
 attendance was high throughout the trial, which was conducted
 fairly and in accordance with Roman-Dutch judicial procedures.
 Appeal is automatic in the event of a death sentence, and
 Colonel Letsie also gave notice of appeal. In light of the
 sheer volume of testimony resulting from this 6-month case, it
 was anticipated that the appeal would not-be heard before the
 middle of 1992 at the earliest.
 There were no known political prisoners in Lesotho at the end
 of 1991.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 In 1991 there were fewer reports of violations of individual
 privacy by state authorities. Although search warrants are
 usually required under normal circumstances, the ISA provides
 police with wide powers to stop and search persons and vehicles.
 and to enter homes and other places for similar purposes
 without a warrant. Police conducted extensive searches of'
 private homes in residential areas, especially around Maseru,
 in the wake of the riots in late May, looking for stolen
 property. Several hundred persons were arrested and charged
 with possession of stolen goods. Correspondence appears to be
 monitored occasionally by government officials.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a,. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Human Rights Act of 1983 provides fbr freedom of'expression
 but subordinates this freedom to the needs of national
 security. The proposed revised constitution includes a lengthy
 section on protection of fundamental human rights and freedoms,
 based primarily on the 1966 Constitution; all parties agree
 with the Government on the need for some such bill of rights.
 Following the 1986 coup, a formal ban on politics was announced
 with stringent restrictions on freedom.of speech and political
 assembly. In particular, Government Order No. 4 of 1986
 prohibited persons and groups from making political speeches
 and from publishing or distributing political party'materials.
 This order was lifted on May 13, 1991, and political parties
 became active in the weeks thereafter. Even before the ban on
 organized political party activity was lifted, members of seven
 of Lesotho's registered political parties participated actively
 in debates on a wide range of political issues in the
 Constituent Assembly. Debate in the Constituent Assembly was
 frequently lively and was often critical of the Government;
 daily reports were broadcast on the radio, and most weekly
 papers carried some report of the discussions.
 The Government controls the official media (one radio station,
 a half-hour daily newscast on a local television channel, and
 two weekly newspapers) and ensures that they faithfully reflect
 official views. The Government rarely uses them to attack its
 partisan critics. Opposition viewpoints were routinely
 expressed in 1991 in two Sesotho-language weekly newspapers
 published by the Roman Catholic Church and the Lesotho
 Evangelical Church and in one independent English-language
 weekly. (Another independent weekly and a bimonthly magazine
 ceased publication in 1991 for financial reasons.)       0
 
 
 194
 LESOTHO
 Academic freedom is generally respected, although some
 professors and students complain about restrictions on their
 ability to discuss academic and political issues. Beginning in
 July, the National University banned partisan political
 activity on campus--in part because several faculty members had
 joined a new party, and there were fears the university would
 suffer reprisals from other party followers. Student
 representatives openly criticized the Government and called for
 greater academic and political freedoms during public
 ceremonies; no reprisals were known to have taken place.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The military Government's ban on "politics" was not interpreted
 to require the dissolution of existing political parties, but
 the ban did preclude political gatherings and rallies until it
 was lifted in May. Following its lifting, party meetings and
 rallies took place throughout the country, limited only by the
 requirement for prior police notification. All meetings of the
 appointed Constituent Assembly in 1991 were open to the
 public. Nonpolitical organizations and professional groups are
 freely formed, even encouraged, and are allowed to hold public
 and regular meetings.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 There is no state religion in Lesotho. Free and open religious
 practice is permitted and encouraged. Christianity is the
 dominant faith of the majority of Basotho, and Roman
 Catholicism has the most adherents, although less than half of
 the population. There is a significant Protestant minority
 composed of the Lesotho Evangelical Church, the Anglican
 Church, and a number of other smaller denominations.
 Conversion is permitted, and there is no apparent social or
 political benefit or stigma attached to belonging to any
 particular church. There are no barriers to missionary
 activity or work by foreign clergy.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Citizens generally are allowed to move freely within the
 country and across national boundaries. In July, however, the
 Minister of Interior ordered a prominent attorney to surrender
 his international passport just before he was due to emplane
 for London to attend a human rights conference sponsored by the
 former King. Asserting that passports remain government
 property, officials claimed there had been complaints from
 other African governments over the subversive nature of the
 conference and that travel for such purposes was in violation
 of the laws governing passport eligibility. By late September,
 the passport had been returned to the attorney. The Government
 places no obstacles in the way of its own citizens who wish to
 emigrate.
 There are currently about 220 refugees registered with the
 United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) who have
 been granted asylum in Lesotho, the majority unaffiliated South
 Africans. The local office of the UNHCR also reports over
 4,000 South Africans in "refugee-like status," most of whom
 have lived in Lesotho for many years. There is no forced
 resettlement of refugees.
 
 
 LESOTHO
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Citizens of Lesotho currently do not have the freedom to change
 their government. However, in 1990 the military Government
 announced its intention to hand over power to a democratically
 elected government by the middle of 1992. In June 1990, it
 convened a National Constituent Assembly which in July 1991
 completed revisions to the independence Constitution of 1966.
 A constitutional commission, drawn primarily from members of
 the Assembly,, held a series of 47 public meetings in late 1991
 to discern public opinion before the final text is approved.
 Voter registration .for the 1992 elections began December 18.
 At the end of the year, plans call for Lesotho to remain a
 kingdom, under a constitutional monarch, with multiple parties
 vying for leadership of a democratically elected Parliament,
 and an independent judiciary. All Basotho citizens over the
 age of 21 will have the right to vote. There are 15 registered
 political parties, including one formed by, but not limited to,
 women.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government in general has not been responsive on human
 rights issues, particularly when the call for outside
 investigation emanated from the domestic political opposition.
 There are no-internal organizations which concentrate on human
 rights, either official or nongovernmental, although church and
 other groups occasionally address human rights issues. There
 are no overt restrictions on the establishment of such
 organizations. Reports of alleged human rights abuses are
 sometimes carried in the local press, particularly the church
 newspapers and Lesotho's major independent weekly. There have
 been no reports of reprisals against human rights activists
 (primarily lawyers and clergy).
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Most citizens of Lesotho speak a common language and share
 common historical'and cultural traditions. Asians (primarily
 ethnic Chinese and Indians) and South African whites are active
 in the country's commercial life. In 1987 the Government
 formulated a policy aimed at "localization" of Lesotho's
 commercial retail trade and, under the Trading Enterprise
 Order, called on foreign owners to enter into joint ventures
 with Basotho nationals. Equity transfers would entail
 compensation. To date, the localization order has not been
 strictly enforced because of difficulties in identifying local
 entrepreneurs to take over foreign-owned businesses, problems
 in financing such takeovers, and concern over foreign reaction.
 In late May, violence based on economic frustrations broke out
 against small-scale merchants of Asian origin. Numerous
 Chinese and Indian stores were burned or looted, police and
 army troops were called in to quell the rioting, and over 35
 people were killed (see Sections l.c. and l.f.). Government
 officials were quick to reassure foreign investors that the
 anti-Asian violence did not reflect government policy, and the
 incidents were not repeated.
 Although the question was briefly debated in the Constituent
 Assembly in 1990, the Government has still not seriously
 
 
 196
 LESOTHO
 addressed the issue of women's rights. In Lesotho these rights
 are severely limited by both law and custom, including in the
 area of property, inheritance, and contracts, but women do have
 the legal and customary right to make a will and sue for
 divorce. Under Lesotho's customary law, a married woman is
 considered a minor during the lifetime of her husband, with all
 of the legal limitations that this status implies. She cannot
 enter into any legally binding contract, whether for
 employment, commerce, or education, without her husband's
 consent. A woman married under customary law has no standing
 in court and may not sue or be sued without her husband's
 permission. Despite their second-class status, women in
 Lesotho traditionally have been the stabilizing force in the
 home and in the agricultural sector, given the absence of over
 100,000 Basotho men who work in South Africa. More female than
 male children complete primary and secondary schools.
 Domestic violence, including wife beating, occurs, but, as
 statistics are not available, the extent of the problem is not
 known. In Basotho tradition a wife may return to her "maiden
 home" if physically abused by her husband; in the common law,
 wife beating is a criminal offense and defined as assault. A
 1976 High Court case successfully reversed a Roman-Dutch legal
 tradition which recognized a husband's right to chastise his
 wife at will. While the Government has made some attempts in
 the past to improve the economic prospects of women, no direct
 action was taken in 1991 to improve their subordinate status in
 society. Women's rights organizations are forming, including a
 partnership of women lawyers which has expressed interest in
 handling such cases. The local chapter of the International
 Federation of Woman Lawyers has taken a lead role in educating
 Basotho women as to their rights under customary and common law.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Workers have the legal right to join or form unions without
 prior government authorization. Roughly 60 percent of
 Lesotho's active male labor force between the ages of 20 and 44
 seeks work in the Republic of South Africa, mainly in gold and
 coal mines. At least 70 percent of the remainder is engaged in
 traditional agriculture. The rest are employed mainly by the
 Government and in small industries and enterprises in Lesotho.
 A majority of Basotho mineworkers are members of the South
 African National Union of Mineworkers (NUM). Because the NUM
 is a foreign organization, it is not permitted to engage in
 union activities in Lesotho.
 Like its predecessor, which since 1988 had been trying to
 arrange a merger between Lesotho's two competing federations,
 the current Government supported the formation of a single,
 umbrella trade union center. Deep philosophical, political,
 and ideological differences between the two federations impeded
 efforts to consolidate. In 1991, however, the Lesotho Congress
 of Free Trade Unions, which encompassed 24 affiliated
 independent trade unions, and the Lesotho Federation of Trade
 Unions which had 4, merged into one federation, the Lesotho
 Labor Congress (LLC), representing the majority of unionized
 workers. It remained to be seen at year's end to what extent
 the new federation will be free of governmental or partisan
 control.
 Unionized workers represent only 10-percent of the total work
 force, and the LLC accounts for three-quarters of those union
 
 
 197
 LESOTHO
 members. Four of the newer, more politicized unions did not
 join the LLC but have instead formed the Congress of Democratic
 Unions. Because the Government wants only one labor central,
 it has not granted recognition to this umbrella organization,
 even though all four of its member unions are legally
 registered.
 While a legal right to strike exists for workers in
 nonessential services, in practice the procedure for calling a
 strike is so lengthy and cumbersome that it discourages legal
 strike actions and accounts for the prevalence of wildcat
 strikes. The 1964 Trade Union and Trade Disputes Act
 enumerates lengthy procedures which must be followed before a
 strike is called. There were several, usually short, wildcat
 strikes in 1991 against'both foreign and domestic companies,
 mostly over wages and conditions of work. Most were resolved
 through compulsory government arbitration. A particularly
 bitter strike broke out in July, with members of the Lesotho
 Union of Bank Employees walking out when the management of two
 foreign-owned international.banks refused their demand for a
 40-percent wage increase. Noting that the banking sector had
 been ruled an "essential" service, the banks fired the striking
 employees and reopened using managerial staff and newly hired
 trainees; later, the management offered to rehire the dismissed
 employees subject to a probationary period. Efforts by church
 leaders and government officials to mediate bore little fruit.
 The strike was broken, and bnly About two-thirds of the
 strikers were rehired.
 The new, combined Lesotho Labor.Congress has maintained the
 widdst possible spread of international trade union links. The
 Government imposes no obstacles to international affiliations
 or foreign travel for labor union-related purposes.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 All trade unions in Lesotho enjoy the right in law to organize
 and bargain collectively, but this right is only recently
 coming into practice. Two sectoral agreements exist, and four
 others are under active negotiation. An Unfair Labor Practices
 Tribunal investigates Unfair labor practices and charges of
 antiunion discrimination and generally attempts to safeguard
 worker rights. A government-appointed Labor Commission is
 charged with, inter alia, monitoring wage and working
 conditions and accepting, reviewing, and investigating worker
 complaints.
 Lesotho has several industrial estates grouping together
 companies, mostly textile and apparel firms, engaged in
 manufacturing for export. There are no prohibitions against
 organized labor in these industrial zones, and in fact the
 Government helped resolve some worker complaints in 1991
 concerning unfair treatment. On the other hand, the new union,
 formed by the merger of two rival organizations representing
 clothing and garment workers, has met with apparent harassment
 and intimidation. Several of its officers were arrested or
 detained by the police in July,.in apparent retribution for
 holding meetings with union members to the displeasure of
 expatriate factory management. The officers were quickly
 released without being charged.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Forced or compulsory labor is prohibited by the 1987 Employment
 Act and not practiced.
 
 
 198
 LESOTHO
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 The legal minimum age for employment in commercial or
 industrial enterprises is 14. In practice, however, children
 under 14 are employed in family-owned businesses. There are
 prohibitions against the employment of minors in commercial,
 industrial, or nonfamily enterprises involving hazardous or
 dangerous working conditions. Basotho minors under 18 years
 may not be recruited for employment outside of Lesotho.
 Enforcement of these laws by inspectors of the Ministry of
 Employment, Social Welfare and Pensions is lax. In Lesotho's
 traditional society, life and working conditions for the
 country's young "herdboys" tend to be much more riqorous and
 demanding than conditions in the modern sector. Their
 quasi-pastoral life, however, is considered a prerequisite to
 manhood and is a fundamental feature of Basotho life,
 tradition, and culture, beyond the reach of labor laws.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 Wages in Lesotho are extremely low. The Government, upon the
 recommendation of a tripartite wages advisory board, again
 raised the statutory minimum wage rates in 1990 for various
 types of work. These amounts are barely sufficient for a
 minimum decent standard of living. Most wage earners
 supplement their monthly income through subsistence agriculture
 or remittances from relatives employed in South Africa. Many
 employers in Lesotho now pay more than minimum wages in an
 effort to attract and retain motivated employees.
 Lesotho's 1967 Employment Act spells out basic worker rights,
 including a 45-hour workweek, a weekly rest period of at least
 24 hours, 11 to 12 days' paid leave per year, and pay for
 public holidays. Employers are required to provide adequate
 light, ventilation, and sanitary facilities for employees, and
 to install and maintain-machinery to minimize the risk of
 injury. In practice, these regulations are generally followed
 only within the wage economy and are enforced by inspectors
 from the Department of Labor of the Ministry of Employment,
 Social Welfare and Pensions, Staff shortages in the Ministry
 of Employment limit effective enforcement to the major urban
 areas.
