 LEBANON
 Human Rights in Lebanon must be viewed in the context of the
 destruction since 1975 of the Lebanese governmental structure,
 particularly the public security and judicial systems. A
 major problem continues to be the central government's
 inability to control the independent militias and Palestinian
 armed groups in large areas of the country. In these areas,
 there have been many abuses of human rights; intimidation,
 kidnappings, and summary executions are common. However, the
 government has increasingly asserted its influence particularly,
 since December 1978. It has tried to reconstruct Lebanon's
 public security system. The policy statement of the new
 Cabinet issued on August 8 stressed that the security issue
 "tops the list of our concerns" and that the government
 must continue to strive to enable the security forces "to
 regain their self-confidence."
 1.   Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 Government authorities do not allow torture. No charges
 of torture have been brought against the government's own
 security forces. The private militias which operate outside
 the control of the central government have tortured captured
 opponents in the past. However, the State Department has not
 documented any such instances in 1979.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Militia factions, Palestinian fedayeen groups, and occasion-
 ally Syrian troops in Lebanon have beaten prisoners. The
 State Department has no recorded cases since December 1978.
 Arrests must be considered in several categories: those by
 the militias, those by Syrian troops, and those by Lebanese
 police and internal security forces. Arrests by the militias
 and Syrian troops are apt to involve rough treatment. Arrests
 by the Lebanese police for serious crimes, as in narcotics
 cases, are apt to involve treatment such as face-slapping
 during interrogation. Beatings have sometimes occurred in
 police interrogation in Lebanon, but not as a systematic
 or officially condoned practice.
 During the civil conflict of 1975-1976, a large proportion
 of the government's prisons were destroyed or put out of
 action in the fighting. The result of this damage and of the
 severe shortage of government-owned housing space since the
 war has been that the re-established prisons are seriously
 overcrowded. The militias maintain prisons of their own (as
 does the Syrian Army), and the degree of overcrowding of
 these prisons varies. In the government prisons, prisoners
 are allowed visits by relatives and attorneys. Since the
 diet is stark, they can acquire supplemental food from
 relatives or through purchase.

 c. Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 Both the Syrian Army and the militias have detained alleged
 partisans of one group or another without benefit of due
 process. The government does not acknowledge holding politi-
 cal prisoners. Under the Lebanese legal system, a judicial
 hearing must be held shortly after an arrest, and an arrested
 person can be held only 24 hours without being charged. Under
 the present circumstances, in which the government is still
 unable to give physical protection to judges and prosecuting
 attorneys, the government has found it difficult to follow
 the letter of the law in arrest and imprisonment cases. Some
 persons have therefore been arrested and held indefinitely
 without being charged or tried. This preventive detention
 can last for up to six months, and requires an order by an
 investigating judge or prosecuting attorney. In areas con-
 trolled by the militias, people are seized by such forces
 and "disappear" for protracted periods.
 d. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The right to a fair trial by judges independent in the ex-
 ercise of their functions is provided for by law, practice,
 and custom, although judges can now insist on closed sessions.
 Defendants are made aware of the charges against them and have
 the usual rights to counsel. Because of the collapse of
 the public security system, however, judges have been un-
 willing to pass judgment or sentences, because they are
 vulnerable to immediate reprisals. The practice therefore
 has developed of holding prisoners without trial, in some
 cases for the period for which they would have been sentenced
 if convicted. Alternatively, prisoners are released on bail,
 with the bail often approximating the fine that would have
 been imposed. These prisoners then jump bail, and go under-
 ground or leave the country. Generally all judicial and
 public security personnel are still subject to effective
 intimidation.
 In some areas, such as Mount Lebanon province and Tripoli,
 the courts are functioning in a regular fashion, and judges
 are sentencing and jailing those convicted.
 The initial policy statement of the new Lebanese Cabinet
 on August 8, 1979, stressing that top priority must be
 given to the security issue, proclaimed, "Security cannot
 be established unless judicial bodies regain their vitality.
 The government is seriously working to restore the vitality
 of the judiciary at the opening of the judicial year."
 e. Invasion of the Home
 Article 14 of the Lebanese constitution provides that "the
 domicile is inviolable. None can enter it except in cases
 provided by the law and according to the form it prescribes."
 In practice, this means that Lebanese authorities must
 acquire the equivalent of a warrant to enter homes. However,
 until the effectiveness of the Lebanese internal security
 forces is restored, in practice Lebanese homes will not be
 safe from intrusion. The Syrian Army forces also have not
 always respected the inviolability of the home.
 
 
 2.   Governmental Policies Relating to the Fulfillment
 of Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care
 and Education
 The Lebanese traditionally operated one of the freest laissez-
 faire economies in the world, even relying on the private
 sector to provide many of the social services which govern-
 ments ordinarily supply. The government is now gradually
 taking a stronger lead in this arena, providing relief and
 reconstruction assistance and low-cost loans. The main
 problems are the absence of a political consensus and the
 internal security situation. People are reluctant to invest
 in long-term projects.
 Income is unevenly distributed. Disparities between urban
 wealth and rural poverty are wide in some cases. There is
 a large, stable, and highly active middle class based on
 comnmerce and services. There are no economic constraints on
 job opportunities. The tax system, such as it remains, is
 progressive.
 Property is privately owned and the right to property is
 protected in normal circumstances. Seizures of property by
 armed Syrian and private militia elements, however, occurred
 frequently since 1975.
 Shelter is a problem for refugees, both Palestinians and
 Lebanese, as a result of sporadic warfare in South Lebanon
 and, in 1978, in east Beirut.
 Health care is available in urban areas from a well developed
 private health-care sector. Public facilities are less than
 adequate in many areas.
 Educational facilities are abundant, but the main burden is
 carried by private schools. Public institutions are of
 generally inferior quality. If they can afford it, Lebanese
 tend to invest heavily in private education at all levels.
 Public education exists through the university level. The
 literacy rate in Lebanon varies according to religious
 sect and socio-economic level. It is highest (90-96 percent)
 among Christians and Palestinians and lowest (perhaps as
 low as 30 percent) among Shia Muslims and non-Palestinian
 refugee groups.
 Lack of an adequate administrative base hinders the fulfill-
 ment of many programs which would broaden shelter, education,
 and health facilities and improve the economic infrastructure
 generally.
 The new Cabinet had stepped up the pace of reconstruction.
 3.   Respect for Civil and Political Liberties,
 Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 Press censorship has given way to self-censorship by the
 press itself. Lebanese newspapers do not print material
 strongly offensive to the non-governmental forces con-
 trolling the area in which that paper is published. However,
 newspapers are distributed in areas controlled by elements
 
 
 786
 hostile to their editorial points of view. Thus, for
 example, the Phalange organ is distributed in anti-
 Phalange west Beirut and Tripoli. There are no government-
 owned newspapers, and the press freely criticizes the
 government. The principal radio and television station is
 government-owned and directed. Illegal radio stations,
 most prominently those of the Christian militias, also
 broadcast freely.
 In general, Lebanese can practice their religions freely;
 prior to the 1975-76 fighting, accomodation among Lebanon's
 fourteen recognized faiths was a cornerstone of the unwritten
 covenant establishing the Lebanese state. The recent civil
 conflict exacerbated underlying religious and political
 tensions, producing a climate of intimidation which still
 persists in areas controlled by both Christian and Muslim
 militant groups. This climate to some degree inhibits the
 public practice of Islam in a heavily Christian area, and
 vice-versa, since such observances could be considered
 politically provocative. Freedom of association is subject
 to the same type of practical limitations.
 Religious distinctions have traditionally been sharply
 drawn and are embodied in arrangements which allocate
 governmental and military positions and parliamentary
 seats on the basis of religious affiliation.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel and Emigration
 Movement within the country has traditionally been free,
 subject only to the practical consideration that large
 areas controlled by private militias or Palestinians could
 be unsafe for "outsiders." Foreign travel is not limited;
 however, the requirement that an applicant for a passport
 present a valid ID card or an excerpt from his civil status
 record can be a practical hindrance to some seeking to
 travel abroad.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 The character of the political system is multi-party. No
 parties are outlawed. Some militant opposition parties can
 function freely only in areas which their adherents control
 militarily, or in "neutral areas" controlled by the government
 forces. Most major political parties either have their own
 newspapers or can get their views fully set forth in
 sympathetic newspapers. However, the private militias and
 the Syrian Army have employed strong efforts--including
 intimidation--to affect the political process.
 Women have the same legal rights as men regarding political
 participation. Owing to cultural traditions, many women
 refrain from participating in the political process. There
 are two significant limitations on women's rights: married
 women cannot leave the country or engage in business if
 their husbands take legal steps to prevent them.
 There is an active trade union movement. Laws grant the
 right to organize, strike, and bargain collectively.
 Lebanon has a modern labor law providing for collective
 contracts, mediation, and arbitration.
 4.   Government Attitude and Record Regarding Inter-
 national and Non-governmental Investigation of
 Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The Department of State knows of no requests for outside
 investigations within the past two years.
