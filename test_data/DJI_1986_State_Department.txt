 DJIBOUTI
 Djibouti, a small, resource-poor nation located at the
 southern end of the Red Sea, is a constitutional republic with
 a one-party system. It has been led by President Hassan
 Gouled Aptidon since it gained independence from France in
 1977. By an unwritten arrangement, the President is a member
 of the politically dominant ethnic Somalis (Issa) while, as
 part of the political balancing act, the Prime Minister,
 chosen by the President, is from the substantial minority
 Afar. There is also a sizable Arab community, mainly Yemenis,
 who have a prominent role in commerce. Cabinet positions are
 divided among the two dominant groups, but in reality the
 Issas control the civil service and the armed forces.
 Presidential elections are held every 6 years, and are next
 scheduled for June 1987. Djibouti has a 65-member elected
 National Assembly. Since 1981, there has been a single
 political party, the Rassemblement Populaire pour le Progres
 (RPP). The last legitimately constituted alternative party,
 the Afar-inspired Mouvement Populaire Djiboutien (MPD), was
 outlawed in 1981 following public violence.
 Djibouti's armed forces consist of a small army supplemented
 by an even smaller navy and air wing. Located between two
 relatively giant neighbors on the Horn of Africa--both of
 which have tribal affinities with an irredentist claim--the
 country has a vital, additional layer of security in the form
 of a 1977 mutual defense agreement with France which ensures
 the continued presence of close to 3,800 French troops.
 Djibouti's economy rests on the activities of a large foreign
 expatriate community (over 10,000), the maritime and
 commercial activities of the Port of Djibouti, the airport,
 and the operation of the Addis Ababa-Djibouti railroad.
 Recent economic stagnation has been compounded by the
 continuous influx, since the Ogaden War (1977-79), of
 refugees, economic migrants, and victims of drought and famine
 from Ethiopia and Somalia. Notwithstanding the assistance of
 the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and
 other relief agencies, these large movements of peoples
 clearly have placed a heavy burden on the Djiboutian economy.
 There was little real change in the human rights situation in
 Djibouti in 1986. Despite tightening one-party rule, the
 openness of the society creates an atmosphere in which most
 citizens feel free to pursue their livelihood without fear of
 government interference. Free enterprise is encouraged in
 Djibouti's service-oriented economy, and the right of private
 property and freedom of movement are generally respected. The
 legal system is still in its formative stages. On any topic
 not yet covered by Djiboutian legislation, the Napoleonic
 Code, initiated during the French colonial period, and, to an
 extent, Shari'a generally applies. Women play a secondary
 role in public life.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section I Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There is no conclusive evidence to substantiate the occasional
 allegation or rumor of government-inspired political killing.
 
 
 91
 DJIBOUTI
 b. Disappearance
 There were no allegations of disappearance of persons for
 political causes.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, and Degrading Treatment
 or Punishment
 In the ethnically polarized environment of Djibouti, there are
 occasional allegations of cruel, inhuman, or degrading
 treatment or punishment. For example, Amnesty International's
 1985 Report (covering 1984) mentioned one charge from 1983 and
 expressed concern over the alleged torture of nine persons
 suspected of belonging to the outlawed MPD. In 1985 and 1986,
 there were no substantiated cases of such injustice. However,
 in September 1986, a former political leader in exile, with
 self-avowed political aspirations, circulated such charges.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The current system of justice is a mixture of French and
 Islamic law. This mixture results in a hybrid legal system,
 based mainly on the French penal code and partly derived from
 Issa tribal common law. On March 19, 1985, the Government
 issued a new decree limiting detention of all persons without
 charge to 48 hours. Within this period, the individual must
 be charged by the examining magistrate. Moreover, the
 prisoner is entitled to legal counsel and must be so
 informed. Although bail and personal recognizance are
 provided for, a judge may choose to hold without bail any
 prisoner against whom charges have been filed. Prosecutors
 are required to, and generally do file charges expeditiously.
 Prison conditions are barely adequate. Family members and
 counsel are permitted access to prisoners, and public health
 and medical services supervise health conditions in a
 generally competent manner.
 There is no forced labor in Djibouti.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Both the State Security Court, established to deal with crimes
 against the security of the state, and ordinary civil and
 criminal courts permit family members and counsel, though not
 the general public, to attend trials. The judiciary has
 remained largely independent of military and executive
 pressures.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Decree Law No. 8 of June 1980 states that government
 authorities "may not enter or remain in the domicile of a
 private individual without his consent and without a legal
 order," except, among other circumstances, when it is
 necessary to facilitate the prosecution of persons accused of
 crimes and when the public order is seriously disturbed.
 There are occasional reports of noncompliance with this
 statute.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 All Djiboutian media are government owned and support the
 
 
 92
 DJIBOUTI
 Government and its policies. Radio/Television Djibouti (RTD)
 claims to receive only limited guidance from senior political
 levels on handling the news it presents to the public. There
 is occasional criticism of the shortcomings of local
 institutions, including some involving key political and
 religious figures, and of corrupt and inefficient practices in
 the bureaucracy, but not of the Government itself. There are
 occasional confiscations of foreign publications which contain
 commentary critical of the Government. The media usually do
 not carry stories which feature violence, crime, or ethnic
 disturbances.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Public meetings require a permit which may be denied for
 security reasons. The Government permits free association
 outside the political realm, and there are several independent
 social, religious, cultural, and commercial organizations.
 The right of labor to organize and strike exists, but only a
 small portion of the work force is unionized. Moreover, the
 Government has organized the single national labor federation,
 the Union Generale de Travailleurs Djiboutiens (UGTD), and
 keeps it under its control and, through it, also controls the
 individual unions. Employees are not obliged to join any
 union. The unions freely maintain relations with recognized
 international bodies in their fields. Temporary stoppages,
 usually protesting working conditions or dismissals, sometimes
 occur. Most large enterprises have affiliates of the UGTD.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Over 96 percent of the population is Muslim, but freedom of
 religious practice, publication, and association with
 coreligionists outside the country is unfettered for all
 religions.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Djiboutians travel freely within and outside their country.
 Passports are generally available to all citizens. There are
 no currency exchange controls.
 Djibouti has had a steady inflow of refugees, economic
 migrants, and famine victims in the past decade. In addition
 to approximately 16,000-18,000 refugees registered with the
 UNHCR, there are unknown numbers (estimates run from 2,000 to
 6,000) of illegal immigrants eking out an existence on the
 margins of the Djiboutian economy. Most of the refugees have
 received assistance from the international community in the
 refugee camp of Dikhil. Several thousand more have
 spontaneously settled in the capital city. Refugees in the
 camps are restricted to them and are not able to move freely.
 The Government has taken an increasingly firm stand in
 returning Ethiopians who do not qualify for refugee status.
 On July 29, 1986, Djibouti, Ethiopia, and the UNHCR decided to
 resume, as of September 1, 1986, the large-scale repatriation
 program halted on December 31, 1984, because of the drought.
 According to the UNHCR, by December 1984 a total of 32,859
 Ethiopians had been repatriated to Ethiopia, of whom 14,281
 had returned to Ethiopia in UNHCR-organized rail moves, and
 19,578 had returned on their own. Djiboutian police caught 12
 
 
 93
 DJIBOUTI
 Ethiopians in a January 1986 sweep near the Dikhil refugee
 camp and returned them to Ethiopia. Persons wishing to return
 voluntarily to Ethiopia may sign up at any one of three
 centers. All remaining card-carrying refugees must submit to
 a case-by-case reexamination of their situation, in principle
 by December 31, 1986.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Djibouti is a one-party state whose leaders and candidates for
 Parliament are chosen by the leadership of the party, the
 Rassemblement Populaire pour le Progres (RPP). While citizens
 are encouraged to become involved in politics and to vote, the
 party leadership, through a 14-member political bureau,
 carefully controls and directs all political activity and in
 1982 selected the single slate of candidates for the National
 Assembly elections. There is thus no democratic means for
 citizens of Djibouti to change their government, but there is
 active competition within the party lists. The one-party
 system was instituted in 1981, and the Government subsequently
 detained leaders of the previous opposition party and
 dissidents allegedly attempting to encourage ethnic strife.
 Traditionally, representatives of most'if not all of the
 nation's ethnic groups are included in the ruling Cabinet.
 However, some Afars complain that the country is run by and
 for the Issas, who dominate the Government, the armed forces,
 and the single party. Others complain that tribal and ethnic
 considerations inhibit appointment of competent administrators.
 In 1986 Aden Robleh Awaleh, an historical leader in the
 struggle for independence, was expelled from the party for
 activities considered prejudicial to the RPP. He fled the
 country and has since been tried and sentenced "in absentia"
 to life imprisonment for the bombing of RPP party headquarters
 in Djibouti in January and for recruiting supporters for
 criminal activity. In September he announced plans for the
 creation of an opposition party in exile.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 On at least six occasions since independence, there have been
 foreign press and other reports alleging human rights
 violations by the Government. The Government has generally
 responded to such charges either by denying them or by
 permitting an investigation, as by the UNHCR and Amnesty
 International in 1981. In July 1986, Djibouti became the 16th
 African state to ratify the Human Rights Charter of the
 Organization of African Unity.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Women in Djibouti enjoy a higher public status than in some
 other Islamic countries, but women's rights and family
 planning are not high priorities. There are no women in
 senior government or party positions. Nomadic traditions
 involving female genital mutilation (particularly excision and
 infibulation) are quite prevalent in Djibouti. The President
 has recognized the key role of women in the small-trade
 sector, and there is an active, local women's organization.

 CONDITIONS OF LABOR
 The level of unemployment has been high since independence.
 In 1980 the International Monetary Fund reported that over 50
 percent of job seekers could not find work. In 1982
 unemployment was estimated at 45 percent and underemployment
 at 33 percent of the work force. Since 1983 several factors
 have exacerbated this trend: the high population growth rate,
 now estimated at 3.1 percent; the influx of refugees and
 displaced persons; and the decline in French assistance and
 spending. Some estimates of overall unemployment for 1986 run
 in excess of 70 percent.
 To combat the high unemployment rate, the Government has
 adopted a labor policy that strongly favors the employment of
 nationals (expatriate labor accounts for about 20 percent of
 the formal sector and better paid jobs). Extensive labor
 regulations inherited from France (the 1952 labor code)
 continue to govern dismissal of employees, who may--and
 frequently do--seek administrative recourse against their
 former employers. Given Djibouti's serious unemployment
 problems and shortage of skilled workers, those who are
 fortunate enough to have jobs are paid surprisingly well. The
 country's average per capita income is well above that of its
 neighbors. Djibouti's nominal minimum wage is about $100 per
 month, but a carpenter or mason will earn six times as much,
 and a maid gets at least double. Social security, medical
 care, and retirement systems also exist in the formal sector.
 Employers normally contribute an amount equal to 18 percent of
 each employee's salary to the Government's generous pension
 and medical insurance programs. Retirement is normally at 80
 percent of salary after 15 years of employment with a minimum
 age of 50. The legal minimum age for employment is 18, and
 the standard of a 40-hour workweek is observed. However, as
 with other African countries, the informal sector (including
 many young children who wash cars, sell cigarettes, and shine
 shoes) is flourishing.
