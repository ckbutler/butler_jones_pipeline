 COSTA RICA
 Human rights and democracy are guiding principles of
 Costa Rica's domestic and foreign policy, and it is actively
 involved in international human rights issues. Costa
 Rica took the initiative in calling for the establishment
 of the Inter-American Human Rights Court and, in 1980,
 its companion institution, the Inter-American Human Rights
 Institute. Both are now housed in new San Jose headquarters,
 formally dedicated by President Rodrigo Carazo Odio in
 August. The Costa Rican government supports both the
 court and the institute with a direct financial contribution,
 supplementing the budget of the Organization of American
 States (OAS). Costa Rica also continues to press for
 the creation of the post of High Commissioner for Human
 Rights at the United Nations.
 Costa Rica is a democratic republic, with the government
 divided into three branches: executive, legislative,
 and judicial. The independent Supreme Electoral Tribunal,
 whose main role is to assure the integrity of the election
 process, is often considered a "fourth branch" of government.
 While the president is the undisputed head of the executive
 branch, he does not exercise control over the other branches.
 Costa Rican political life corresponds to the constitutional
 model in practice and in spirit. Government transitions
 have taken place smoothly after elections. During the
 last thirty years, the party not in power has won every
 quadrennial- election, with the exception of 1974. In
 1978 the Liberation Party, which had governed the country
 for eight years under two presidents, was turned out
 in favor of an opposition coalition led by current president
 Rodrigo Carazo.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 Article 40 of the Costa Rican constitution prohibits
 torture, a prohibition which is respected in practice.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 Article 40 of the constitution reads: "No one shall
 be submitted to cruel or degrading treatment nor to life
 imprisonment...a declaration obtained through violence
 shall have no value." The Costa Rican government is
 in the midst of a program to upgrade the conditions in
 the country's prisons.
 c. Disappearances
 There are no abductions or secret arrests by official
 security forces or by elements condoned by the government.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 Constitutional guarantees against arbitrary arrest or
 imprisonment are respected in practice. Under Costa
 Rican law there is a requirement that arraignment must
 take place within 24 hours. The constitution guarantees
 the right of habeas corpus. There are no political prisoners
 in Costa Rica.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 
 
 392
 Constitutional guarantees of fair public trial are respected
 in practice. Defendants have the right to choose their
 own counsel and access to counsel is unimpeded. Public
 counsel is provided free of charge, if necessary. The
 independence of the judiciary is protected, inter alia,
 by a constitutionally-specified fixed percentage of the
 national budget allocated to the judicial system. There
 are no military or political courts.   There is a regular
 system of appeals through the various court levels, as
 well as a separate court for appeals from administrative
 decisions of the executive.
 f. Invasion of the Home
 Court-ordered warrants are required for entry into private
 residences. Neither forced entry nor other violations
 of the home have been credibly alleged.
 2. Government Policies Relating to the Fulfillment of
 Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care, Employment
 and Education:
 The government has been conscientious in its efforts
 to reduce both rural and urban poverty by providing social
 services and generating employment. Costa Rica has a
 very good educational system. Over the past three years
 25 percent of the national budget has been allocated
 each year to education, and Costa Ricans have long been
 proud of the fact that they spend much more for education
 than for defense.  (In calendar year 1980, defense spending
 constituted 0.5 percent of the Gross Domestic Product
 (GDP), and 2.64 percent of the total budget.) The adult
 literacy rate is approximately 90 percent.
 The government is committed to providing low-cost, accessible
 health care to all Costa Ricans and has made significant
 progress in recent years toward fulfullment of thIs goal.
 There are three separate but complementary programs for
 health care delivery: the Social Security System, the
 programs of the Ministry of Health and Social Development,
 and the Family Assistance Program. The Social Security
 System (CCSS) covers some 80 percent of the population
 and about 60 percent of the work force with medical and
 retirement benefits. Full coverage is expected by 1984.
 In rural communities of over 500 people, the CCSS or
 the Ministry of Health operate health centers. Smaller
 rural communities are served by health posts under the
 supervision of the Ministry of Health. It is estimated
 that more than 90 percent of the rural population in
 the smaller communities is covered. This rural health
 program provides preventive and curative health assistance,
 nutrition education, and family planning services.
 The Social Development and Family Assistance Law passed
 in 1974 is an integrated approach to income distribution
 for people outside the mainstream of development. This
 Law created a fund, financed by an 8 percent sales tax
 and a maximum 5 percent payroll tax, which finances activ-
 ities of other governmental agencies (Social Security;
 Ministries of Health, Agriculture and Public Works; Social
 Assistance and Community Development Agencies; Land Coloni-
 zation Institute; etc.). The fund finances pensions
 for the indigent, land purchase and settlement, and vocational
 training, among other activities. The major emphasis,
 especially in rural areas, has been on health, maternal
 and child nutrition, sanitary systems, and education.
 
 
 393
 
 The feeding program, funded by the family assistance
 program and carried out by government ministries, is
 a major effort to reduce malnutrition among children
 and pregnant and lactating mothers. The program was
 first implemented in hard-to-reach rural areas and an
 effort was made to enlist community interest and help
 in such activities as transporting the food and maintaining
 the feeding centers. The program now feeds nearly 100
 percent of the school age children in rural areas, where
 it is most needed.
 Although the income tax system is progressive in principle,
 the largest portion of government revenues results from
 trade and consumption taxes which fall most heavily on
 low income groups. Income distribution, although still
 skewed, has become more equitable. Income figures are
 not available. Current economic difficulties may again
 cause a widening of the gap.
 The Costa Rican economy is mixed but oriented toward
 free enterprise capitalism. The government operates
 several major industries, such as electric power production
 and distribution and telecommunications. Private ownership
 of property is protected.
 Costa Rica had a per capita gross domestic product of
 $1880 in 1979. Although agriculture is still important,
 employing about 35 percent of the labor force and accounting
 for 19 percent of the GDP, industry has become the single
 largest contributor to the GDP. The average unemployment
 rate (in 1979) was 4.9 percent.
 Costa Rica is at a crossroads in its national development.
 Over three decades of economic growth came to an end
 in 1980 and the country is entering a period of painful
 adjustment. External factors such as low coffee and
 high oil prices adversely affect the economy. Internal
 factors, especially large public sector deficits, have
 also caused a loss in international reserves, pressure
 on domestic prices and growing debt. The current account
 deficit in the balance of payments, which will exceed
 $650 million in 1980, has been financed for the past
 several years through borrowing from Foreign Commercial
 Banks. Public and private payments on long, medium and
 short term debt in 1981 will use over 40 percent of projected
 export earnings; total public external debt is over $2
 billion. The government took steps in September 1980,
 to restrict imports and stimulate exporfs, including
 a two-tiered foreign exchange system. The Costa Rican
 economy faces inflation, unemployment and a stagnant
 economy in 1981. Evolution of the economic situation
 over the next several years will depend heavily on the
 outcome of negotiations with the International Monetary
 Fund.
 The tradition that women should remain in the home as
 wife and mother has, in many cases, inhibited equal access
 to jobs and equal wages for the same work. This problem
 is diminishing with time and as the need for more trained
 workers grows. The National Apprenticeship Institute
 is offering non-traditional training for women in such
 areas as wood processing, appliance repair, and gas station
 service. Some 23 percent of women aged 12 and over are
 economically active (vs. 76.5 percent of the men).
 3. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 
 
 394
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly:
 Constitutional guarantees of freedom of speech, religion
 and assembly are respected in practice. The free press
 presents divergent views and no limitations have been
 imposed on its ability to criticize the government.
 There is no discrimination on the basis of religion.
 Labor unions are free to organize, strike, bargain collec-
 tively, and lobby. The labor union movement, however,
 is relatively weak, particularly in comparison with most
 other Costa Rican social institutions. There is currently'
 an effort on the part of the government and the political
 parties to develop more efficient mechanisms to foster
 unions. Changes may include a reform of the 37-year-
 old labor code to incorporate more specific ground rules
 for collective bargaining.
 b. Freedom of Movement within the Country, Foreign Travel,
 Emigration and Repatriation:
 Domestic and foreign travel and emigration are unhindered.
 In addition, Costa Rica provides refuge for many people
 of varying political persuasions, including thousands
 of Nicaraguans who fled their country during the 1978-
 79 civil war and several thousand Salvadorans who departed
 their strife-torn country during 1980. Following its
 late 1979/early 1980 welcoming of over a hundred former
 Cuban political prisoners, Costa Rica acted to deal with
 the international problems created first by the occupation
 of the Peruvian Embassy in Havana and then by the massive
 exodus of Cubans from Mariel, Cuba, to south Florida.
 The Costa Rican government first pledged to receive 300
 of the Peruvian Embassy Cubans, then all 10,000; plans
 were being made to use Costa Rica as a way station for
 the movement of the Cubans when Cuban President Fidel
 Castro abruptly ended the Havana to San Jose airlift
 and opened the human flood gates at Mariel. Costa Rica
 hosted two successive international conferences to deal
 with the issue, taking part in a Tri-Partite Commission
 which unsuccessfully attempted to negotiate with the
 Cuban government, and pressing the problem in international
 fora. At this writing, some 2,000 Cuban refugees who
 arrived in Costa Rica during 1980 remain there.
 Costa Rica accepts the international responsibility to
 repatriate its own citizens, and, during 1980, also accepted
 back into its territory several Cuban nationals who had
 attempted to flee Costa Rica and illegally enter the
 United States. Costa Rica does not forcibly repatriate
 citizens of other countries if there is any danger of
 political or other persecution in that country, With
 the assistance'of local voluntary groups and international
 agencies, Costa Rica has provided for refugees to the
 best of its ability. Women are not subject to different
 rules in matters of internal or foreign travel, emigration
 or repatriation.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process:
 Freedom to participate in the political process is provided
 for in the constitution and respected in practice. Elections
 are free, competitive and open. No parties are outlawed.
 Registry of parties and of voters is impartially controlled
 by the Supreme Electoral Tribunal, which operates free
 from interference by any individual or institution, including
 the government in power. A measure of the open political
 process in Costa Rica is the current campaign being conducted
 
 
 395
 prior to the February 1982 presidential and legislative
 elections. The presidential candidate of the opposition
 party was chosen in convention during April 1980. The
 contenders fdr the nomination of the governing coalition
 were vying at year's end in their own selection process,
 expected to produce a standard bearer by February 1981.
 The constitution provides for equal job and income rights
 for women. They are employed in prominent positions
 in the government, including three cabinet ministers
 and five (of 57) members of the legislative assembly,
 one of whom was vice president of the assembly during
 the 1979-80 session. At the University of Costa Rica,
 46 percent of the students are women.
 4. Government Attitude and Record Regarding International
 and Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged violations
 of Human Rights:
 Costa Rica has been a strong and consistent supporter
 of human rights in international fora and has extended
 a standing invitation to the Inter-American Human Rights
 Commission to visit whenever it wishes. Costa Rican
 governments regularly invite observers from the OAS and
 other institutions to witness the quadrennial elections.
 Costa Rica has accepted the automatic jurisdiction of
 the Inter-American Human Rights Court, and was among
 the first to ratify the American Convention on Human
 Rights.
