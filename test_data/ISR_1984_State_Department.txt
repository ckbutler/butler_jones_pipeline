 ISRAEL AND THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES*
 Israel is a parliamentary democracy which guarantees by law
 and respects in practice the civil, political, and religious
 rights of its citizens. It has an independent judiciary, free
 elections, a multiparty political system, and an elected
 legislature (the Knesset) which may restrict the Government by
 legislation and can bring it down by a vote of no confidence.
 A Knesset vote in March led to early elections in July and to
 the formation of a National Unity Government in September.
 Israeli society is characterized by its openness and its
 lively public debate of all issues of popular concern. Police
 and internal security functions are under the control of
 Cabinet ministers who must answer to the Knesset for the
 actions of personnel for whom they are responsible and whose
 performance is subject to the scrutiny of a free press.
 Israel enjoys a relatively high standard of living. It has a
 market economy with substantial governmental participation and
 subsidized prices for basic commodities. Its economic policy
 has been oriented toward social welfare. In recent years,
 Israel has experienced increasing balance of payments
 deficits, rising foreign debt, triple-digit inflation, and
 most recently a declining level of foreign exchange reserves.
 From its founding in 1948 until 1979, a formal state of war
 existed between Israel and all of its Arab neighbors. In
 1979, as provided in the Camp David Accords, Egypt and Israel
 signed a peace treaty; pursuant to the treaty, Israel returned
 to Egypt, over a three-year period, that portion of the Sinai
 Peninsula which had been under its control since the 1967
 war. Israelis doubt that other Arab states are prepared to
 accept Israel's right to exist on the basis of U.N. Security
 Council Resolutions 242 and 338. Terrorist incidents in
 Israel and the absence of peace treaties with its other Arab
 neighbors make security a dominant concern which affects many
 facets of national life. The state of emergency declared when
 Israel was founded remains in effect.
 The presence of an Arab minority presents Israel with the
 challenge of accommodating within its society a large
 non-Jewish group which does not share the Zionist principles
 upon which the state was founded. (There are also Jewish
 communities in Israel which reject the Zionist ideal.)
 Israeli forces continued to occupy southern Lebanon during
 1984. The Government of National Unity has established as one
 of its principal objectives the withdrawal of Israeli forces
 from southern Lebanon while preserving the security of
 Israel's northern border.
 As in 1983, the most significant human rights problems for
 Israel continued to derive from the strained relations between
 Israeli authorities and the Arab inhabitants of the occupied
 territories. These problems were exacerbated as a consequence
 of the activities of Jewish settlers in those areas. During
 the year, Israeli leaders expressed concern over the potential
 *Because of the sharply differing socio-political environments
 in Israel and in the Arab territories which Israel has
 occupied since the 1967 war, the respective human rights
 situations are treated in separate but parallel fashion. The
 report on the occupied territories follows the report for
 Israel.

 growth of extreme views and violent actions and their effects
 on Israeli society.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There is no indication that political killing is sanctioned by
 Israeli authorities. In April 1984, two terrorists who
 hijacked a bus died as a result of blows dealt by security
 agents after they were captured. A commission of inquiry
 determined that no order was issued to the security forces
 from which it could have been inferred that the two men were
 to be killed or injured, and that the killings were caused by
 individuals who deviated from accepted orders and norms. The
 breach of military norms was widely condemned by political
 leaders and the media. The Defense Minister accepted the
 commission's recommendations that legal action be taken
 against the responsible individuals and that all possible
 steps be taken to ensure that there is no recurrence of such
 an incident. The head of the Army's southern command, who was
 in overall charge of the area where the Arabs were beaten, has
 been reprimanded, and the Justice Ministry is investigating
 the incident.
 In 1984 there were deaths as a result of terrorist acts. In
 February, 21 persons were injured when a parcel containing
 hand grenades exploded outside a clothing store in Jerusalem.
 In April, terrorists opened fire with automatic weapons on
 passersby in Jerusalem, wounding 48 and killing 1. In other
 incidents, terrorists set off a bomb on a passenger bus in the
 city of Ashdod, causing the death of three passengers and
 injuring six others, and hijacked a commuter bus north of the
 Gaza Strip. Organizations such as the Democratic Front for
 the Liberation of Palestine and the Abu Nidal terrorist group
 frequently took credit for these acts. Also in April, Jewish
 terrorists were foiled in an alleged attempt to bomb five Arab
 buses in Jerusalem. Suspects were apprehended and trials were
 under way at year's end.
 b. Disappearance
 There are no reports of such a practice in Israel.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Such practices are prohibited and there were no confirmed
 reports of their occurrence in 1984. Evidence or confessions
 obtained under duress are inadmissible in court, and the
 administrative codes of conduct of the prison and police
 authorities contain stringent sanctions against the use of
 force or brutality. Police officers accused of brutality or
 violence may be prosecuted either in administrative courts for
 violation of the code of conduct or in regular criminal courts
 for criminal assault. Acute overcrowding of prisons remains a
 problem.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Israeli law provides strong guarantees against arbitrary
 arrest or imprisonment. Writs of habeas corpus and other
 
 
 1262
 ISRAEL AND THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES
 procedural and substantive safeguards are available.
 Defendants are considered innocent until proven guilty.
 Administrative detention can be employed in security-related
 cases when a judge determines that formally charging a person
 would compromise sensitive sources of evidence. Any
 administrative detainee is entitled to representation by
 counsel and must be brought before the president of the
 appropriate district court within 48 hours of being taken into
 custody. Upon application of the Defense Minister to a
 district court, the right to representation by counsel may be
 delayed from 48 hours to 7 days in most instances and up to 15
 days in terrorist-related cases. Each case of administrative
 detention must be submitted to judicial review at least every
 three months thereafter for the entire period of detention.
 The decision of the president of the district court can be
 appealed to the Supreme Court. In 1984 an Israeli Arab was
 detained on his return from an overseas trip on suspicion of
 having been in contact with foreign elements hostile to
 Israel. A judge ruled favorably on a government request that
 the individual be detained for eight days. The individual
 appealed the order and, five days after he was initially
 detained, was released by order of the Supreme Court which
 ruled that there were insufficient grounds to warrant his
 continued detention.
 During 1984 Israel held as many as 1,000 prisoners arrested in
 Lebanon. These persons, predominantly Lebanese, were held in
 southern Lebanon at the Ansar detention camp and at a facility
 in Nabatiyah. In June, Amnesty International said that more
 than 130 Palestinians and Lebanese were reported to have been
 held in incommunicado detention in the military prison of
 Atlit in Israel since mid-November 1983, when they were
 secretly transferred there from the Ansar Camp. In July,
 representatives of the International Committee of the Red
 Cross (ICRC) were granted access to them.
 Israel does not accord prisoner-of-war status under the Third
 Geneva Convention to prisoners captured during and after the
 Lebanese conflict who were not members of the armed forces of
 another country. Israel has maintained, however, that such
 detainees are treated in accordance with the provisions of the
 Fourth Geneva Convention in all matters relating to the
 guarantee of humane treatment and conditions of internment.
 It has stated that under the Fourth Geneva Convention it has
 the right to intern persons who constitute a danger to the
 security of the detaining power or its armed forces. The
 Israeli Supreme Court has confirmed the applicability of the
 standards of the Fourth Convention, while holding that, for
 security reasons, Israel is permitted to deny the detainees
 access to family members and legal counsel. Israel has
 permitted ICRC representatives to visit the detainees.
 On June 28, 1984, under the auspices of the ICRC, Israel
 released 291 Syrian military personnel captured during the
 Lebanon war, as well as 20 security prisoners, 7 of whom
 returned to Syria. In exchange, three Israeli prisoners of
 war and three civilian employees of the Israel Liaison Office
 in Beirut were freed.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The right of a hearing by an impartial tribunal with
 representation by counsel is guaranteed by law. The judiciary
 is independent and effectively insulated from political
 
 
 1263
 ISRAEL AND THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES
 interference. With the exception of security cases, which may
 be tried by military courts, all trials are open. In security
 cases, the law provides that part or all of a trial may be
 closed, with the burden of justifying in-camera proceedings
 falling on the prosecution. Counsel is present during closed
 proceedings. In security cases, the law also provides for
 possible restriction on the choice of defense counsel.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Privacy of the individual and the sanctity of homelife and
 correspondence are fully protected. There are effective legal
 safeguards against arbitrary invasion of the home.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Freedom of speech and press, limited by security-based
 censorship provisions, are basic rights in Israel. These
 rights are protected by law and the judiciary, and are broadly
 exercised by citizens and individuals and by an independent
 and vigorous press, which expresses a wide variety of
 political opinion.
 The law forbids tangible public manifestations of support for
 organizations defined as terrorist. Proscribed acts include
 flying the Palestinian flag or displaying its colors,
 displaying Palestinian nationalist slogans, and publicly
 expressing support for the Palestine Liberation Organization.
 In June, two Israeli Arabs received prison terms of a year and
 18 months, respectively, for flying Palestinian flags and
 painting anti-Israeli slogans. In July three Israeli Arabs
 received prison sentences and were fined for raising a
 Palestinian flag at a rally and at a memorial service. The
 heaviest sentence in this case was seven months in prison and
 a $l,000 fine.
 Media censorship is based on British Mandatory emergency
 regulations, according to which the censors may prohibit the
 publication of material which, in their opinion, will harm the
 defense of Israel, the public safety, or public order.
 Censorship decisions may be appealed through the judiciary.
 In practice, censorship of the media is usually limited to
 military security matters, and journalists generally know
 which security-related areas are off-limits to publication.
 In April the military censor suspended the newspaper Hadashot
 from publishing for four days after it defied a ruling against
 publication of the news that the Defense Minister had set up a
 commission of inquiry to investigate the events surrounding
 the deaths of the four Arabs who had hijacked a passenger
 bus. The newspaper's owners obtained a temporary stay and
 appealed the decision to the Supreme Court which upheld the
 censor. Other Israel newspapers heeded the Government's plea
 not to publish the news about the commission on the grounds
 that disclosure could jeopardize the lives of Israelis
 imprisoned in Arab countries. A New York Times correspondent
 in Israel was called to the office of the director of the
 government press office in Jerusalem to discuss censorship
 violations by the journalist concerning the same incident.
 Israeli radio and television are run by the independent Israel
 Broadcast Authority (IBA). The Government helps to fund the
 IBA and appoints its governing board, but has almost no
 control over programming. The independence of the IBA is
 
 
 1264
 ISRAEL AND THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES
 protected by law, subject to the censorship provisions. Radio
 and television broadcasts include programs in Arabic as well
 as in Hebrew.
 Licenses to publish newspapers are required and normally are
 routinely issued. There have been reports, however, that
 applications from Israeli Arabs are scrutinized more closely
 than others and sometimes turned down without explanation. In
 1984 an Israeli Arab scholar was refused a license to publish
 an independent journal in Arabic.
 Movies and theater are subject to censorship if deemed
 pornographic or otherwise offensive to religious or social
 mores or likely to create a disturbance of public order. In
 1984, one film was banned for pornographic content.
 Possession and distribution of literature considered hostile
 to the State and issued by illegal Palestinian organizations
 are punishable offenses.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 These are basic rights in Israel, protected, along with the
 right to demonstrate, by law and rulings of the courts. In
 the case of political rallies and outdoor meetings beyond an
 established size, permits are required and routinely granted.
 Israel has a free and democratic labor movement, which plays
 an important role in the social, economic, and political life
 of the country. Israel's most powerful labor organization,
 the General Federation of Labor (Histadrut), and its
 affiliates operate the largest national health insurance
 program and seven retirement pension systems, as well as a
 number of large industrial enterprises. Histadrut membership
 comprises over 85 percent of the working population. The
 membership includes 60 percent of the adult Israeli Arab
 population. Workers, including those in the public sector,
 make frequent use of the right to strike.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Israel was founded as a Jewish state in which all citizens are
 guaranteed freedom of religion by law. Muslims, Christians,
 Druze, and other minority religious groups make up about
 17 percent of the population. The prevailing interpretation
 of the Jewish nature of the state has been secular rather than
 religious. The Law of Return of 1950, which abolished all
 restrictions on Jewish immigration, and the Citizenship Law of
 1952, which granted every Jew the right to citizenship upon
 arrival in Israel, confer an advantage on Jews in matters of
 immigration and citizenship.
 All religious groups may maintain contacts with their
 coreligionists outside Israel. Foreign clergy are permitted
 to live in Israel to minister to their coreligionists.
 Several thousand Israeli Muslims make the Hajj pilgrimage to
 Mecca each year. There is no operating seminary for Muslim
 clergy and religious functionaries in Israel. Muslims may
 obtain such training in institutions in East Jerusalem, the
 West Bank, or Egypt. The International Center of the Baha'i
 religion is located in Haifa.
 Israel has retained the Ottoman millet system under which each
 religious community is governed in matters of personal status
 by its own religious law and not by civil law. This feature
 
 
 1265
 ISRAEL AND THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES
 of the law gives each religious community freedom to observe
 its own customs and religion within the area where the millet
 system applies, but sometimes causes serious inconvenience to
 individuals who do not follow the established norm within one
 religious community. These difficulties do not normally arise
 in religious worship, but among Jews do occur in areas such as
 marriage or conversion to Judaism. Within the Jewish
 community the orthodox tradition is the established norm, and
 conservative and reform rabbis have no official standing.
 A 1977 law prohibits the offering and receipt of material
 benefits as inducements to religious conversion. In a
 clarification in 1979, the Justice Minister stated that the
 law is not intended to restrict the religious freedom of any
 community or to impede any community from the pursuit of
 normal educational or philanthropic activities. The Attorney
 General has ordered that no action be taken under the law
 without his express permission, and the law has not been
 employed. It nevertheless continues to cause uneasiness among
 some Christian groups. Persons considered to be missionaries
 have been the subject of physical attacks by private
 individuals. The Religious Affairs Ministry cooperates with
 and gives financial support to a variety of interfaith groups
 which seek to promote understanding between members of
 different religious groups.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Israeli citizens enjoy freedom of movement within the country
 and are free to travel abroad or to emigrate, subject to
 military service-related obligations. Emergency regulations,
 however, provide that Israeli citizens, by military order, may
 be confined to their neighborhoods or villages or barred from
 traveling to the occupied territories. Restrictions of this
 nature have been applied most often to Israeli Arabs. In
 March, the commander of the northern command issued an
 administrative order forbidding an Arab Anglican priest from
 visiting the West Bank and the Gaza Strip for six months. The
 order was subsequently renewed. Other Israeli Arabs were
 confined to their homes during the year.
 Since 1948 Israel has taken in over a million Jewish refugees
 from the Middle East, North Africa, and Europe, and has worked
 toward integrating them into its society and economy.
 Integration of smaller numbers of new immigrants continues.
 United Nations General Assembly Resolution 194 of December 11,
 1948, calls upon Israel to permit Arab refugees who left their
 homes in the 1947-48 fighting to return if they are willing to
 live in peace, or to be compensated for their losses if they
 choose. Israel has not recognized the validity of this
 resolution, pointing out the losses to its own citizens who
 fled Arab states; it did, however, take back some refugees
 under the principle of family reunification and it has
 indicated willingness to take back some refugees in the
 context of a final peace settlement.
 The legal status of the Hebrew-Israeli community (usually
 known as Black Hebrews), which numbers about 1,200, remained
 unchanged since 1983. Many community members are long-term
 residents, having settled in the early 1970's. However, few
 are in the country legally, the tourist visas on which they
 entered the country having expired. They are able to leave,
 
 
 1266
 ISRAEL AND THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES
 but cannot return. Approximately 85 Black Hebrews renounced
 their U.S. citizenship and may be considered stateless, as the
 Government of Israel does not accept their claim to immigrant
 status under the Law of Return.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 All adult Israeli citizens have the right to vote for
 candidates of their choice and to participate in the political
 process. Seven of the 120 members of the Knesset are from the
 Israeli Arab community. Israeli Arabs are included in the
 Knesset election lists of several of the Zionist parties and
 the non-Zionist Israeli Communist Party, which derives most of
 its support from Israeli Arabs. In the elections for the
 eleventh Knesset in July, an Arab-Jewish list, the Progressive
 List for Peace (PLP), received two seats.
 In June, the central elections committee for the eleventh
 Knesset refused to approve the PLP and the Kach party, which
 favors the expulsion of Arabs from Israel, as valid parties to
 run for the Knesset on the grounds that they endangered the
 rule of democracy and the State of Israel. These decisions
 were overturned by the Supreme Court and both parties competed
 for and won seats in the Knesset.
 Women participate freely in the political process and account
 for more than 40 percent of the political party membership.
 Ten members of the Knesset and two Supreme Court judges are
 women. There are no women in the 25-member Cabinet. One
 woman is currently serving as a Deputy Minister.
 Section 4 Government Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-Governmental Investigation of Alleged Violation
 of Human Rights
 The Government maintains an office of human rights in the
 Foreign Ministry, and several human rights groups in Israel
 work for the protection of individual liberties and women's
 rights. Private groups, such as the Israeli League for Human
 and Civil Rights and Peace Now, freely criticize Israeli
 government actions in Israel, the occupied territories, and
 Lebanon. They issue statements and reports, hold press
 conferences, and organize demonstrations without governmental
 interference.
 The Government permits visits to Israel by representatives of
 private international human rights groups, as well as the
 United Nations Economic and Social Council, the World Health
 Organization, and the International Labor Organization.  The
 Government of Israel has generally permitted the ICRC to visit
 prisoners taken in Lebanon and the occupied territories. It
 also investigates and replies to inquiries by organizations
 such as Amnesty International. In the section of its 1984
 report dealing with Israel and the occupied territories,
 Amnesty International expressed concern about the imprisonment
 of prisoners of conscience; the use of administrative
 measures, with no judicial involvement, to physically restrict
 individuals without charge or trial; allegations of torture or
 ill-treatment of detainees; the passing of two death
 sentences; and the denial of the protection accorded under
 internationally accepted standards to thousands of detainees
 captured by Israel after the Israeli invasion of Lebanon.
 Freedom House considers Israel "free"; it characterizes the
 situation in the occupied territories as "partly free."
 
 
 1267
 ISRAEL AND THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 The population of Israel is about 4.1 million and has been
 increasing by about 1.6 percent a year. Per capita gross
 national product is about $5,085. Unemployment in 1984 was
 about six percent.
 Israel historically has run a balance of payments deficit in
 order to provide the resources to absorb large-scale
 immigration in the early years of statehood, maintain a high
 defense capability, and raise the general standard of living.
 Substantial financial assistance from abroad, public and
 private, has helped cover the payments gap.
 Israel has been beset by severe economic problems, with
 increasing balance of payment deficits, a large foreign debt,
 and rising triple-digit inflation (in 1984 the consumer price
 index increased by about 500 percent) the most serious
 concerns. The worldwide recession and the strength of the
 dollar have hurt exports, thereby increasing the payments
 deficit.
 A complex system of indexing, which ties salaries, most
 financial assets, and pensions to the consumer price index,
 has protected most of the population from the most damaging
 effects of high inflation. The new Government is seeking to
 reduce the balance of payments deficit by cutting private
 consumption and the budget and imposing tighter monetary
 controls, while seeking to stimulate economic growth and
 exports. The trade balance improved somewhat in 1984.
 State education in either secular or religious schools is
 compulsory for all citizens through age 15. The primary
 school enrollment ratio is about 97 percent and the literacy
 rate about 89 percent. The parallel education systems in
 Israel for Jews and Arabs, conducted in Hebrew and Arabic
 respectively, show a disparity in quality, with greater
 resources per student going into the Jewish system.
 Israel has an advanced health care system with a high
 doctor-to-patient ratio. Life expectancy is 74 years, and the
 infant mortality rate is 14.1 per 1,000 live births. Safe
 drinking water is available to the entire population.
 Title to 93 percent of the land in Israel is held by the State
 or quasi-public organizations in trust for the Jewish people.
 According to law, anyone may purchase the remaining seven
 percent of privately owned land through ordinary commercial
 transactions.
 The Israeli Arab minority has equal rights under the law in
 most respects, and Israeli Arabs have made substantial
 educational and material progress since the founding of the
 State. Some have risen to responsible positions in the civil
 service, generally in the Arab departments of government
 ministries.
 Israeli Arabs, however, are relatively powerless and tend to
 feel alienated. Despite some governmental and private efforts
 to bridge the gap, there is little social interaction with
 Israeli Jews. Israeli Arabs assert that they are denied equal
 access to education, housing, and other services, and that
 they are discriminated against in such areas as employment and
 
 
 1268
 ISRAEL AND THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES
 appointment to government positions. Government grants to
 area local councils represent a smaller percentage of the
 budgets of these bodies than do similar grants to Jewish
 municipalities. While Arabs make up about 16 percent of
 Israel's population, less than 2 percent of the persons in
 senior government positions are Arabs, less than 3 percent of
 Israeli judges are Arabs, and no large bank, industrial
 enterprise, or agricultural undertaking in Israel is headed by
 an Israeli Arab. Israeli Arabs make up three percent of
 university students and less than one percent of the academic
 positions in the universities.
 Druze and Circassians are subject to the military draft, and
 some Bedouin serve voluntarily in special units. Most other
 Muslims and Christians have not been permitted to serve and
 therefore have not qualified for many of the economic and
 social benefits which require military service as a
 precondition.
 Women's rights in Israel are protected by law as well as by
 governmental and private organizations. The Equal Opportunity
 Law forbids discrimination on account of sex or marital or
 parental status, and employers are legally bound to pay female
 workers a wage equal to that paid male workers for the same or
 generally similar work. Laws and regulations also provide for
 protection of the rights of female employees with respect to
 pregnancy and childbirth. The Government includes a senior
 adviser on the status of women, and the Civil Service
 Commission and several government ministries have officers
 responsible for promoting fair treatment for women and
 ensuring that the rights of women are protected. A number of
 non-governmental women's organizations also work to advance
 the status of women, ensure equal opportunity in all fields,
 and other family services such as child care for working
 mothers.
 Over 40 percent of university graduates are women, as is
 39 percent of the work force. Women account for approximately
 two-thirds of the instructors employed in the educational
 system. They occupy about one-fifth of the senior positions
 of the professional grade of the career civil service, are
 well represented in professional and technical jobs in the
 media, and work in a broad range of the professions and other
 occupations. Women are drafted into the army for service in
 non-combat units.

 THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES
 The territories which Israel has occupied since 1967 consist
 of the West Bank, East Jerusalem, the Golan Heights, and the
 Gaza Strip. The West Bank and Gaza remain under military
 government. Israel regards East Jerusalem and the Golan
 Heights as subject to Israeli law, jurisdiction, and
 administration.
 The U.N. Security Council and General Assembly have adopted
 resolutions, in which the United States concurs, asserting
 that Israel's presence in all these territories is that of an
 occupying power. As such, Israel's governance is subject to
 the Hague regulations of 1907 and the 1949 Fourth Geneva
 Convention concerning the protection of civilian populations
 under military occupation.
 Israel declares that it voluntarily observes most of the
 Fourth Geneva Convention's provisions with respect to the West
 Bank and Gaza, even though it does not accept that these areas
 are within the purview of the Convention. Major differences
 have arisen in regard to the applicability of these provisions
 to the introduction of civilian settlers and to the use of
 collective punishment.
 The complex human rights situation of the occupied
 territories, particularly in the West Bank where the majority
 of the settled Arab population is located, is largely the
 result of friction between occupation authorities and the
 indigenous Arab population. Israel implements its policy in
 the West Bank and Gaza through separate civil administrations.
 These were created in 1981 and are under the control of the
 Defense Ministry. They are staffed by military as well as
 civilian personnel. Israel's national police, border police,
 security service, and the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) all have
 a role in the administration of the occupied territories.
 Although the national police, which includes local
 Palestinians in its ranks, is seldom the target of criticism,
 there are frequent complaints by West Bankers and Gazans about
 the actions of the other organizations.
 In February 1984, the Government released the report of a 1981
 commission of inquiry headed by Assistant Attorney General
 Yehudit Karp into law enforcement in the occupied
 territories. This report pointed up difficulties in
 investigating accusations of violence against Arab residents
 by Israeli military personnel, border police, and settlers.
 The Commission found many instances in which cases were
 dropped, investigations were not concluded, or external
 interference by military government personnel affected
 investigations. Although written in 1982, the Karp Report
 remains a statement of Israel's continuing difficulties in
 providing equal treatment and police protection to all
 inhabitants of the occupied territories.
 Israel has continued to expand Jewish settlements in the
 populous areas of the West Bank. The Palestinian inhabitants
 are concerned that settlements and associated practices,
 including the evolution of a different system of laws for
 settlers, might be intended to lay the groundwork for eventual
 annexation of the West Bank and Gaza. This concern was
 exacernated by statements by the former government that, at
 the end of the transitional period called for in the Camp
 David Accords, Israel would assert its sovereignty over these
 areas. (The Camp David Framework provided for a five-year
 
 
 1271
 THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES
 transitional period for the West Bank and Gaza, during which
 negotiations are to take place to determine their final
 status.) Some Israeli political figures and groups repeatedly
 assert that the West Bank is an integral part of the land of
 Israel which may never be relinquished to Arab control.
 Civil Administration authorities have attempted to reshape
 local politics, particularly by blocking the influence of the
 Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) and by promoting an
 alternate leadership. Israeli support of the Village Leagues,.
 West Bank quasi-political organizations, continued to diminish
 in 1984 and the Leagues are no longer a significant factor in
 West Bank politics.
 Israel permitted West Bank municipal elections in 1972 and
 1976 but postponed, without rescheduling, the elections to be
 held in 1980. Since then, the occupation authorities, citing
 security considerations, have removed elected and appointed
 officials in the West Bank and Gaza. Israel has allowed the
 establishment of four universities in the West Bank where none
 existed before (as well as a university in Gaza) but has
 restricted student and faculty members and activities which it
 regards as tnreatening to its security. Israel permits
 criticism of its policies by the East Jerusalem-based Arabic
 press but has often censored articles and editorials on stated
 security grounds and restricted the circulation of Arabic
 publications in the West Bank and Gaza. It has also imposed
 broad restrictions on speech and assembly in those areas.
 Arab and Jewish residents continued to suffer from terrorist
 acts in 1984. Responsibility for acts against Israelis was
 claimed by Palestinian organizations outside the occupied
 territories. During 1984, four Israeli groups were arrested
 by security forces for terrorist acts against Arab residents
 of the occupied territories.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 Political killing is not condoned by the Israeli Government.
 There have been, however, deaths and serious injuries as a
 result of terrorist acts. At least six Israelis were injured
 by gunfire attacks on their vehicles. Two Arab bystanders
 were injured mistakenly by Israeli return fire in one
 incident. Approximately 20 Israelis were wounded in rock or
 Molotov cocktail attacks. Several Palestinians were killed in
 clashes with security forces, including one Palestinian youth
 during a demonstration at Bir Zeit University in late November.
 There were numerous acts of arson, vandalism, and bombings
 against both Israelis and Arabs during the year. Palestinian
 organizations outside the occupied territories generally
 claimed responsibility for acts against Israelis. In March,
 three IDF soldiers and several local residents were wounded by
 a grenade thrown at an IDF patrol in Gaza. Also in March,
 five supporters of the Israeli Kach movement ambushed an Arab
 bus, injuring several Arab workers. The perpetrators were
 subsequently arrested; three have been convicted and one
 acquitted because the fifth defendant, who had earlier turned
 state's evidence, has fled Israel.
 
 40-387 0 - 85 - 81
 
 
 1272
 THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES
 In June, police arrested 34 Israeli citizens for complicity in
 tne placing of bombs on five Arab-owned buses in Jerusalem,
 the 1980 car bombings which maimed two Arab mayors and an
 Israeli army sapper, conspiracy to blow up the Dome of the
 Rock, and on other charges. Also in June, two Israeli
 settlers were convicted of complicity in the 1983 murder of a
 9-year-old Nablus girl. A third suspect, accused of actually
 shooting the girl, remains on trial.
 In July, several Gaza youths received sentences of up to 15
 years for throwing grenades at IDF patrols and attempting to
 assassinate the deposed mayor of Gaza.
 In August, the Bethlehem area head of the Village Leagues and
 two of his sons were convicted of the attempted assassination
 of Bethlehem mayor Elias Preij. Several other Village League
 leaders remain under investigation on possible murder and
 other serious charges.
 b. Disappearance
 There were two claims of disappearance resulting in the murder
 of West Bank residents during 1984. Neither case has yet been
 resolved. On April 12, Nabil Ahmad Falayfal, a professor at
 Bir Zeit University was taken from his home by unidentified
 men. His body was discovered 16 days later. The press
 reported allegations by his wife that she believed security
 forces had arrested her husband.
 Billal Najjar, a resident of Burin village and student at An
 Najah University in Nablus, was reported missing on March 16.
 His decapitated body was later found. In October, an Israeli
 attorney representing his family petitioned an Israeli
 district court for an inquiry into the alleged role of Israeli
 security forces in his disappearance. Friends and relatives
 have claimed that he disappeared while in the custody of
 security forces.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Torture is forbidden by Israeli law and there is no evidence
 that torture is condoned by the Israeli authorities. Several
 Israeli border and national policemen were convicted of
 abusive use of force against Arab prisoners during 1984.
 On March 5, 1984, a Farah prison official was convicted of
 beating Arab detainees. In June, two IDF officers serving in
 Gaza were prosecuted for beating and blinding in one eye a
 Gaza resident they were questioning. On September 18, two
 Israeli policemen were indicted for severely beating an Arab
 attempting to visit a relative at Jerusalem police
 headquarters. On September 19, a second Farah official was
 sentenced to four months imprisonment for obtaining
 confessions by force. On October 15, four border policemen
 were convicted for the 1981 beating of a Tulkarm youth.
 The Supreme Court twice during the year ordered the withdrawal
 from evidence of confessions by West Bankers on the grounds
 that they appeared to have been obtained by force. On June
 19, a 15-year-old Farah prison detainee's confession was
 ordered withdrawn when the court found the prosecutor's
 explanation of his numerous cigarette burns unsatisfactory.
 The confession of a second Farah detainee was ordered
 withdrawn from military court consideration on the grounds it
 
 
 1273
 THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES
 was obtained by force. These court actions lend credibility
 to other allegations of prisoner abuse at Farah publicized in
 April by the League for Human and Civil Rights, an Israeli
 human rights organization, and by Law in the Service of Man,
 the West Bank affiliate of the International Commission of
 Jurists.
 Several U.S. citizens have alleged that they received cruel or
 degrading treatment while under detention. In April, a U.S.
 citizen of Arab origin was arrested, while visiting his
 mother, for alleged security offenses committed outside Israel
 or the occupied territories. The citizen reported to consular
 officers that he was deprived of sleep, subjected to prolonged
 frigid showers, and prevented from receiving medication for a
 heart ailment. After interventions by U.S. representatives,
 his treatment improved. He was released without charges on
 April 24, after 22 days of confinement.
 The U.S. citizen supporters of the Kach movement arrested for
 armed attack on an Arab bus also reported to consular officers
 that during their interrogations they were forced to wear
 blindfolding hoods for prolonged periods and were deprived of
 sleep. Consular officers had some success in securing
 improved treatment for the detainees.
 Palestinian prisoners at the newly opened Jnaid Prison near
 Nablus conducted a hunger strike during September in protest
 of alleged overcrowding, poor food, lack of exerciser and the
 prison's extensive television monitoring system. After an
 inquiry, the Police Minister granted some of the prisoners'
 requests and the strike ended peacefully.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Individuals may be held in administrative detention without
 formal charges for up to 18 days. The normal detention period
 after the filing of charges is 60 days before trial. This
 period can be extended by a Supreme Court judge for an
 additional three months and he may do so again from time to
 time. In 1984, there were over 150 such detentions.
 A sizable number of Arabs are often arrested after terrorist
 incidents or the dispersal of demonstrations. Such arrests
 usually do not result in formal charges or prolonged
 detentions. The security forces can and do detain individuals
 without prompt notification of their relatives and apparently
 without the use of warrants. Some Arabs allegedly have been
 detained by the police when attempting to verify the detention
 of a relative.
 Persons arrested for common crimes are usually provided the
 opportunity for bail, access to an attorney, and a clear
 statement of charges. Persons detained for security
 investigations are not permitted bail and initially are denied
 access to an attorney or other outside contact including with
 relatives or consular officers. In some cases, officials have
 declined initially even to confirm the fact of an individual's
 detention to consular officers. This denial of notification
 of arrest to any third party can, under Israeli law, be
 extended for up to 15 days. It is unclear whether detainees
 are informed of the specific charges against them. Many of
 those released from such detention without charges claim
 ignorance of the reasons for their detention.
 
 
 1274
 THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES
 Approximately 25 Arabs were placed under new or renewed town
 arrest orders for 3 months or more during 1984. A few
 individuals are under their ninth consecutively renewed
 order. Such restrictions, which often make it difficult for
 those affected to practice their profession or pursue their
 studies, involve no formal charges and are ordered by regional
 military commanders without judicial review. Many of those so
 restricted are deposed mayors, political activists opposed to
 Israeli occupation, or persons outspoken in their criticism of
 Israeli policies or in their support of the PLO. Town arrests
 imposed on some individuals, most notably deposed Mayor Karim
 Khalaf of Ramallah, were lifted during the year. Violators of
 town arrests are subject to fine or imprisonment.
 Several refugee camps were placed under curfew during the
 year. In March, residents of El Arroub camp alleged that
 their water supply was cut off for two weeks as punishment for
 a security incident. Complaints about other forms of
 collective punishment employed by security forces, such as the
 holding of groups of Arab men in town or village squares for
 long periods, declined in 1984.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Jordanian law, as modified by some 1,100 Israeli military
 orders, remains in force in the West Bank for most criminal
 and civil matters. British Mandatory law, as modified,
 prevails in Gaza. The judicial application of these laws,
 except in security cases, land acquisition, or where
 jurisdiction has been transferred by military order, has been
 left in the hands of an Arab judiciary, which acts
 independently of Israeli authority. Residents of the occupied
 territories accused of nonsecurity offenses receive public
 trials in local courts. In East Jerusalem and the Golan,
 Israeli law applies.
 Israeli law does not precisely define when a given crime will
 be considered a security offense. Persons arrested during
 demonstrations or suspected of having committed security
 offenses are normally subject to military trial. In practice,
 Israeli residents of the occupied territories accused of
 security offenses are not tried by military court but by the
 Israeli district court closest to their residence or the scene
 of their crime. The Israeli citizens currently under trial
 for participation in the 1980 car bombing of Arab mayors, the
 placing of bombs on Arab buses, and other terrorist actions in
 the occupied territories are being tried at Jerusalem District
 Court.
 Alleged security offenders are tried in Israeli military
 courts with a military judge presiding, and are defended by
 counsel. Most military trials are open to the public, except
 for some cases involving serious security offenses. Consular
 officers normally have no difficulty in attending any court
 proceeding in which a foreign citizen is involved.
 Israeli military courts have asserted jurisdiction with
 respect to alleged security offenses committed outside Israel
 and the occupied territories. In April a U.S. citizen was
 arrested and charged with contributing money to, and
 performing services for--while in the U.S.--an American
 charitable organization thought to be linked with the
 Palestinian movement. After several weeks' detention, he was
 released and permitted to return home. In subsequent
 
 
 1275
 THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES
 statements, Israeli officials have defended the principle of
 extraterritorial jurisdiction for military courts.
 Orders of the Civil Administration may be appealed to the
 Supreme Court. Nonjudicial administrative orders of the
 military government may be appealed to area military
 commanders and the Supreme Court. No appeal of military court
 verdicts is possible, although the area commander can and does
 exercise the right of commutation.
 The Karp Commission Report on law enforcement in the occupied
 territories found that Arab residents, out of fatalism or fear
 of retaliation, "refrain from complaining" to the police when
 the security forces or settlers are involved. The report
 found evidence of 'a vicious circle in which occurrences
 aren't investigated for lack of complaint, while complaints
 are not submitted because of a lack of proper investigation.*
 Israel continued to claim as state land additional areas of
 the West Bank often regarded by local inhabitants as community
 or private land. Palestinians frequently complain that they
 are not provided written notification of these decisions or
 that tne 30-day period for biling competing claims is too
 brief to obtain substantiating documentation. Israeli
 authorities respond that extensions are granted upon request,
 and that no title is required if the claimant can prove he has
 cultivated the disputed land for at least 10 years (a
 provision some assert not always observed). In some cases,
 earth-moving work has been permitted to begin before the
 30-day period has elapsed.
 There are complaints by Arabs that the adjudication of appeals
 from pertinent military orders by a committee composed of
 military officers does not provide an independent, fair review
 of the dispute. A claimant may appeal through the legal
 system up to the Israeli Supreme Court. In 1984, there were
 at least three such appeals.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Under occupation regulations, military authorities can and do
 enter private homes and institutions without prior judicial
 approval in pursuit of security objectives. In 1984, at least
 19 houses of West Bank and Gaza residents accused of
 involvement in security incidents were demolished or sealed
 and their families displaced. In some 19 other cases, only
 tne rooms actually inhabited by the accused were sealed.
 There is no judicial process prior to a decision to seal or
 demolish a house or room in security cases. These decisions
 often follow immediately after a security incident and before
 conviction of the suspect. In 1984, senior security officials
 indicated that house demolitions and sealings would no longer
 be employed. Houses or rooms used by Israelis convicted of
 security offenses in the occupied territories were not
 demolished or sealed in 1984.
 A number of houses and other structures also were demolished
 in the West Bank and Gaza on the grounds that they were
 constructed without proper authorization. Arabs complained
 that their houses were constructed in accordance with licenses
 issued by various Arab municipalities but that Israeli
 officials later ruled the site outside municipal
 jurisdiction. In one case near the settlement of Gilo, an
 
 
 1276
 
 THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES
 Arab home continually occupied by the family since 1931 was
 demolished by an Israeli private contractor before scheduled
 appeal could be heard by the Supreme Court. The Municipality
 of Jerusalem has indicated it will seek indictment of the
 contractor.
 Security forces dispersed several demonstrations by armed
 settlers at Deheshieh refugee camp and other sites during the
 year. Botn Arabs and settlers have complained of intimidation
 through vandalism of cars and other property.
 It is widely believed that mail and telephone services in the
 West Bank and Gaza are monitored. Individuals can be and are
 questioned on their political views by security officials.
 Such inquiries can involve overnight detention.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil and Political Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Freedom of expression is restricted on security grounds.
 Proscribed acts include flying the Palestinian flag or
 displaying its colors, displaying Palestinian nationalist
 slogans, and publicly expressing support for the PLO. The
 Arabic press, most of which is located in East Jerusalem,
 remains outspoken in its criticism of Israeli policies and
 actions. Arrests, prison sentences, land seizures, and other
 politically sensitive stories are generally reported, but
 editorials and articles are frequently censored or excised by
 the Israeli censor. In 1984, a study by Israeli researchers
 for the Fund for Free Expression alleged that Israeli censors
 attempt not only to prevent the publication of national
 security information, but to eradicate expression that could
 foster Palestinian nationalist feelings or deny Israeli
 legitimacy.
 Materials licensed to be published in East Jerusalem are free
 to circulate there but require an additional license, which is
 not always granted, for distribution in the West Bank and
 Gaza. Unlicensed distribution is illegal and can result in
 seizure of the publications and the arrest of those involved
 in their transportation and distribution. On December 29,
 1983, the magazine As-Shira was ordered permanently closed and
 its owners fined for the publication of extremist PLO
 propaganda. The owners argued that the offending articles had
 been passed by the military censor prior to their
 publication.
 Arabic educational materials, periodicals, and books
 originating outside Israel are censored for anti-Semitic or
 anti-Israeli content and for the encouragement of Palestinian
 nationalism. The occupation authorities have maintained a
 list of some 1,300 forbidden publications. Banned works
 include anti-Semitic and official Arab propaganda,
 publications of the PLO's Institute of Palestine Studies, and
 works by individuals identified with Palestinian organizations
 opposed to the existence of Israel. Possession of such
 materials by a West Bank or Gaza Arab is a criminal offense.
 The Fund for Free Expression study held that the list includes
 "every work that expresses or arouses Palestinian national
 feelings.'  In October, Defense Minister Rabin announced his
 intention to reduce the list from 1,300 to approximately 300
 titles.
 
 
 1277
 THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES
 Arabic-language radio and television programs from Jordan,
 Syria, and other Arab countries, including broadcasts of the
 Voice of Palestine, are received in the occupied territories
 without jamming.
 In September, the District Commissioner of Jerusalem announced
 an investigation into the proposed closure of the Arab-owned
 Palestine Press Service on security grounds. The matter
 remains pending.
 Foreign journalists have not reported any difficulties in
 meeting with inhabitants of the occupied territories. All
 reports filed by the foreign press, however, are subject to
 military censorship.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Israeli authorities have permitted a wide range of labor,
 professional, and fraternal groups organized before 1967 to
 continue to function. Professional associations, especially
 those of doctors, lawyers, pharmacists, and engineers, are
 active and frequently take public stands on political issues.
 No political parties or other groups viewed as primarily
 political are permitted. Public gatherings require
 permission, which is often withheld from both Arab and Israeli
 groups on the grounds of public order.
 There are approximately 40 labor unions, grouped into two
 rival federations. No new labor unions have been created in
 the West Bank since the occupation, and a number of Arab
 unions have oeen disbanded by occupation authorities for
 alleged political activity. Strikes are legal so long as they
 are not undertaken for political reasons. There were no
 reports of arrests for labor-organizing activity during 1984.
 West Bank unions are generally small and confined to urban
 workers in skilled craft trades. The occupation authorities
 must approve all candidates for election to union office. The
 most recent elections for leadership of the General West Bank
 Federation of Trade Unions were held in October 1983.
 Membership in the Histadrut, the Israeli national labor
 organization, is open to Arab workers from East Jerusalem and
 the Golan Heights. Most Arabs in East Jerusalem have declined
 such association. Senior Histadrut leaders argue that Arab
 employers exploit this refusal to withhold from Arab workers
 the hours and wage protection afforded to Histadrut members.
 Histadrut has taken steps to equalize working conditions for
 Israeli and Golan Druze.
 Since 1978 the International Labor Organization (ILO) has
 regularly sent fact-finding missions to Israel and the
 occupied territories. In 1984, an ILO team visited Israel and
 the occupied territories from February 23 to March 4 and
 issued a report in April of its findings on labor conditions.
 The team noted that various trade union premises had been
 searched by the authorities and that a number of union leaders
 and members had allegedly been arrested. Among its
 recommendations, it urged that 'the impact of the state of
 occupation...on the exercise of trade union activities should
 be reduced to a strict minimum, respecting the guarantees on
 which freedom of association is based and thus ensuring that
 Arab workers from the occupied territories enjoy effective
 trade union coverage in accordance with the basic principles
 of the ILO... "
 
 
 1278
 THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES
 c. Freedom of Religion
 There is freedom of religious practice. No groups or sects
 are banned on religious grounds. Muslim and Christian
 holidays are observed without hindrance, and Muslims and
 Christians operate a variety of private schools and
 institutions. The occupation authorities tolerate the
 existence of a number of Islamic fundamentalist groups. There
 has been no reported interference with the publication or
 distribution of religious publications.
 Israel has protected Muslim and Christian holy places and
 usually has assured freedom of access to them. On occasion,
 both Arab and Jewish groups have been denied access to
 religious sites on religious or security grounds. At Hebron's
 Ibrahimi Mosque/Tomb of the Patriarchs, Arab complaints
 continue that the military government has reduced Muslim
 access to the shrine by setting aside space and time for
 Jewish worshippers, and that armed Israeli troops are present
 inside the mosque. In September, Muslim leaders protested the
 installation of a closed circuit security television system,
 claiming that it was installed without the knowledge or
 consent of the Muslim authorities. There has not yet been a
 formal response to this protest and the camera is still in use.
 During 1984, the Mufti of Jerusalem several times protested
 the alleged behavior of Israeli border policemen assigned to
 security duty inside the Haram as-Sharif/Temple Mount
 complex. Muslim leaders charged that they harassed
 worshippers and showed disrespect to Islamic sites and
 sentiments. In September, one of the suspects in the Jewish
 terrorist underground trials was convicted of participation in
 a conspiracy to destroy the Dome of the Rock with explosives.
 He was sentenced to 44 months imprisonment. Trials of other
 alleged conspirators are continuing. Another group of Israeli
 religious zealots was convicted in April of an attempted
 break-in at the complex to destroy the Dome of the Rock. They
 were convicted and are now in prison. Also in April another
 group of four young Israelis from Jerusalem were arrested and
 charged with some 12 grenade attacks on Muslim and Christian
 sites in Jerusalem. A nun was seriously injured in one attack.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Freedom of movement is generally unrestricted for Arabs within
 the occupied territories, but certain categories are
 significantly restricted. Approximately 80,000 Arabs travel
 daily to Israel to work. Vehicles owned by Arab inhabitants
 of the territories have distinct license plates and are
 frequently stopped for security checks. Arab inhabitants of
 the occupied territories are required to obtain permits to
 remain overnight in Israel; West Bankers are generally
 forbidden to remain in Jerusalem after midnight.
 Most inhabitants of the occupied territories are permitted to
 travel abroad and many thousands do so each year. Exit visas
 are required. Israel issues laissez passers to residents to
 facilitate foreign travel after a security check. In some
 cases restrictions are imposed on reentry. There are also
 restrictions on certain categories of residents, including a
 mandatory minimum of nine months residence abroad for young
 men.
 
 
 1279
 THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES
 Temporary collective punishment bans are occasionally imposed
 on foreign travel by residents of areas where security
 incidents have occurred. Residents of at least 10 West Bank
 towns were banned from traveling abroad for periods of up to
 40 days after security incidents. Such bans are also imposed
 on some individuals, including majors and other leaders and
 persons suspected of anti-occupation activities. Travel bans
 are also imposed on some individuals, including mayors and
 other leaders and persons suspected of anti-occupation
 activities. Local inhabitants are sometimes prevented from
 traveling abroad to attend international conferences or
 political meetings and are proscribed from direct contact with
 members of the PLO. A number of prominent West Bankers did
 travel to Jordan in early 1984 for meetings with King Hussein
 and Yasser Arafat. Although some received warnings from the
 Israeli authorities before and after their meetings, no
 sanctions were imposed.
 Despite the formal state of war between Israel and Jordan,
 two-way travel between the West Bank and Jordan is permitted.
 Inhabitants of the West Bank returning from Jordan, as well as
 other Arabs or persons of Arab descent, are subject to
 searches of person and property, which many complain are
 unnecessarily harsh and constitute harassment.
 Israel permitted all but one of the members of the Jordanian
 Parliament resident in the West Bank to travel freely to
 attend the Parliament's reconvening in January. The-obstacles
 to that member's travel have since been removed.
 Some former West Bank residents who obtained foreign
 citizenship after emigration from the area have claimed that
 upon returning to their original homes they are permitted only
 to remain as tourists for a limited period. West Bankers also
 complain that spouses and children born abroad are sometimes
 denied entry or residency permits.
 There are no official obstacles to emigration and
 approximately 15,000 Arab inhabitants emigrate annually.
 Gazans normally do not require approval for travel to the West
 Bank. Under special arrangements concluded between Israel and
 Egypt, thousands of Gazans regularly cross the border into
 Egypt, particularly to work or visit relatives in the divided
 city of Rafah. Israel permits Golan Heights Druze to return
 after attending school in Syria. It has not, however,
 permitted the return of Syrians who fled or were expelled from
 the area during and after the 1967 war.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government.
 The West Bank and Gaza are ruled by a military government
 established after Israel's victory in the 1967 war. There is
 no regional self-government and only limited Arab
 administration at the town level; most villages retain their
 traditional leadership. Arab civil servants, institutions,
 and municipal officials operate under the military
 government. Israeli authorities have removed elected and
 appointed Arab officials, and neither these removals nor the
 subsequent appointment of Arab or Israeli replacement
 officials is subject to review by the local inhabitants or
 their institutions. No formal political parties or overtly
 political organizations are permitted. Municipal elections
 
 
 1280
 THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES
 were held in 1972 and 1976 and were widely regarded as fair.
 Elections scheduled for 1980 were postponed and have not been
 rescheduled.
 Twenty-three Arab mayors and municipal councils were elected
 in 1976. Fourteen of the mayors and at least four municipal
 councils have been dismissed by occupation authorities. The
 major towns of Hebron, Nablus, Ramallah, and El Bireh are
 ruled by Israeli officials. Arab mayors appointed by their
 town councils lead Halhoul and Jericho. Bethlehem and Tulkarm
 are the only major towns governed by elected mayors.
 Arab residents of East Jerusalem are permitted and encouraged
 to vote in municipal elections. Israeli officials state that
 20 percent of those eligible did so in the October 1983
 elections, although some Arab sources claimed that it was
 substantially less.
 Most Arab residents of the West Bank are Jordanian citizens
 and as such are represented by 2 senators and 30 members of
 the Jordanian Parliament.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitudes Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights.
 A variety of local groups, both Israeli and Palestinian, are
 concerned with human rights issues. These groups'
 publications and statements are circulated in the occupied
 territories. The International Center for Peace in the Middle
 East, an Israeli organization, issued a detailed study of
 human rights in the occupied territories in late 1983. The
 West Bank Data Project, another Israeli organization, acting
 on behalf of the U.S.-based Fund for Free Expression, issued a
 report on Israeli censorship of Arab publications.
 Law in the Service of Man, the West Bank affiliate of the
 International Commission of Jurists, is involved in legal
 assistance on human rights issues. During 1984, the center
 issued statements on several topics, including a study of the
 controversial new prison at Jnaid.
 Israel normally permits international human rights groups to
 visit the occupied territories. In 1984, the International
 Commission of Jurists and the U.K. Committee of the World
 University Service published a report based on a joint mission
 of inquiry undertaken by the two organizations in 1983 into
 the problems faced by Arab institutions of higher education in
 tne occupied territories. The report examined university
 closures, book censorship, and general administrative
 constraints imposed on the universities.
 In the section of the 1984 Amnesty International report
 dealing with Israel and the occupied territories, Amnesty
 International expressed concern about the imprisonment of
 prisoners of conscience; the use of administrative measures,
 with no judicial involvement, to physically restrict
 individuals without charge or trial; arbitrary arrest and
 short-term detention without charge or trial; allegations of
 torture or ill-treatment of detainees; the passing of two
 death sentences; and the denial to thousands of detainees,
 captured by the IDF in Lebanon, of the protection accorded
 them under internationally accepted standards. Freedom House
 considers Israel 'free;* it characterizes the occupied
 territories as "partly free.'

 THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 Living standards have risen substantially since 1967. In the
 West Bank, per capita gross income in 1983 was three times its
 1967 level. Much of this increase can be attributed to the
 large numbers of West Bankers working in Israel and to
 remittances from Palestinians abroad. In 1984, however,
 Israel's economic problems began to affect West Bankers.
 Israeli statistics in September for the first time indicated a
 decline in the number of Palestinians working in Israel.
 Palestinians maintain that there has been a substantial drop
 in business activity since mid-year. A large but undetermined
 portion of the Arab work force is traditionally underemployed
 or engaged in seasonal work.
 Economic life in the occupied territories has become enmeshed
 in Israeli regulations. Some are characteristic of Israeli
 bureaucracy; others may be used politically. While Israel is
 concerned that funds from the PLO or other hostile sources
 might be brought in under the guise of development, Arabs
 contend that even projects which are fully funded by proven
 local sources have not been approved. The new Government has
 indicated that it will review favorably several longstanding
 Arab proposals. In October, the Government announced its
 formal approval of a longstanding proposal for an Arab-owned
 bank in the occupied territories.
 Israeli restrictions on the export to Israel of West Bank and
 Gaza products, especially agricultural produce, limit local
 market opportunities. The export to Jordan of agricultural
 products is sometimes temporarily banned by the occupation
 authorities as punishment of an area where a security incident
 has occurred. West Bank farmers and manufacturers also have
 suffered from periodic Jordanian restrictions on their ability
 to transship goods through Jordan.
 Israel restricts the construction of new factories through a
 number of regulations. The limitation on the amount of money
 an individual West Banker may import was recently raised to
 5,000. Several Arab municipalities have been permitted to
 import funds held in Jordanian banks. Arabs continue to
 maintain, however, that Israel restricts entry of Arab funds
 for economic development as well as for philanthropic or
 educational purposes.
 The taking of land for settlements and for military use has
 strongly affected the lives of Arab residents, including their
 employment patterns. Such land amounts to some 40 percent of
 the West Bank. During 1984, the authorities announced an
 extensive road building campaign for the northern West Bank
 which, if implemented, will remove a substantial portion of
 the remaining Arab agriculture land from use.
 There are more than 150 nonmilitary settlements in the West
 Bank (excluding unilaterally expanded Jerusalem) and Gaza,
 with a total population of about 32,000. Water scarcity in
 most parts of the West Bank constrains agricultural and urban
 development. Water use is a contentious issue between the
 resident Palestinians and the occupying Israelis.
 The United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) and the
 military government meet the basic educational needs of
 refugee students in the West Bank. Overall adjusted primary
 school enrollment has risen from about 56 percent of the
 
 
 1282
 THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES
 school-age population in 1967 to about 83 percent in 1984.
 The number of girls receiving education has markedly increased
 and now represents about 45 percent of the student total.
 The West Bank is served by four universities, one community
 college, and a variety of other educational institutions, all
 established or upgraded since the beginning of Israeli
 occupation. Most were closed for varying periods during the
 year after confrontation with security forces. Bir Zeit
 University was closed for two months and An Najah University
 for four. The authorities seized materials considered
 inciteful displayed at a university cultural exhibition and
 found weapons elsewhere on the campus. None of the
 universities receives financial support or other assistance
 from the occupation authorities. Representatives of all four
 have complained about restrictions on their activities. A
 recent report by the International Committee of Jurists and
 the World University Service concluded that the pattern of
 Israeli treatment of West Bank universities over the past five
 years has been one of 'harassment going beyond what might be
 reasonably justified on the grounds of public order or
 security.*
 The Gaza Strip consists of 363 square kilometers. It has a
 population of about 500,000 with a per capita income of about
 $1,100. Gaza's economy advanced marginally in the early
 1980's, compared with real growth of over 10 percent in the
 late 1960's and 5-6 percent in the late 1970's. Local
 employment in the Gaza Strip is highest in private and public
 services which provide about half the area's domestic
 product. Construction and agriculture each contribute roughly
 20 percent and light industry 10 percent of Gaza's gross
 national product.
 Citrus, Gaza's traditional money earner, is grown on about
 half the cultivated land. Citrus suffered a fourth poor year
 in succession in 1983-1984. Local producers attribute this
 decline to Israeli and Jordanian marketing restrictions,
 shortage of water, and rising production costs. In 1984, the
 Israeli tariff on citrus exported outside Israel from Gaza was
 reduced by more than 50 percent. Israeli authorities also
 have taken measures to reduce water usage in the Gaza Strip to
 allow the water table to rise and inhibit saline intrusion
 from the Mediterranean.
 The local fishing industry has shrunk since the Israeli
 withdrawal from Sinai due to restrictions on waters in which
 Gazans are allowed to fish. The fishing fleet, whose 50
 ton/day catch is marketed approximately two-thirds to Israeli
 merchants and one third locally, may support up to 25,000
 people, including families of registered fishermen and those
 providing ancillary services. About 35,000 Gazans commute
 daily to work in Israel. Gaza's income from work in Israel
 represents about one-third of its total income according to a
 recent Bank of Israel report.
 Since 1967, infant mortality has declined sharply and health
 services have improved. Gaza's basic needs for food,
 clothing, and shelter are largely met. UNRWA, private
 voluntary organizations, and the Israeli government provide
 special assistance to over 20,000 needy persons. Housing
 conditions remain especially crowded in the eight Gaza refugee
 camps, where approximately 210,000 of the 370,000 refugees
 registered with UNRWA live. UNRWA statistics indicate that,
 
 
 1283
 THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES
 as of mid-1984, approximately 35,000 refugees had left the
 camps to live in Israeli government-sponsored communities.
 Gazans suffer from an absence of social and cultural
 activities. Although there is a literary journal, no
 newspapers are published. Inadeqate classroom space has
 forced double-shifting at many schools in recent years.
 Gaza's El Azhar University, which retains its affiliation with
 El Azhar University in Cairo, offers a four-year undergraduate
 program to about 3,300 Gaza students. There is also local
 interest in creating a two-year technical/vocational college.
 The Israeli-occupied portion of the Golan Heights consists of
 1,295 square kilometers, and has an Arab population of about
 15,000, mostly Druze and a small percentage of Alawites.
 Approximately 7,500 Israeli settlers live in some 32
 settlements in the Golan Heights. Druze village councils have
 complained that they do not receive adequate funding for
 municipal services and local education.
 Urban West Bankers are increasingly sophisticated in their
 social attitudes, including toward the role of women, but the
 rural majority continues to hold more traditional social
 values.
 There are no legal or administrative prohibitions on the
 employment of women in the occupied territories, although
 traditional cultural mores and family commitments limit most
 to homemaking. Most Palestinian women holding jobs outside
 their homes reside and work in urban areas. Employment is
 concentrated in service industries, education, and health
 services, with a small number working in journalism, law, and
 other professions.
 While legally women have equal access to public education,
 custom and family pressures limit the number of women in West
 Bank schools. Even so, female school enrollment is quite high
 in Middle Eastern standards. A little over 45 percent of the
 primary and secondary school students are female. While
 female enrollment at the postsecondary level varies between
 roughly 30 to 45 percent at coeducational West Bank colleges
 and universities, a number of teacher and vocational training
 centers are all male or all female.
 There are a wide range of women's cooperative groups for
 health care, child care, handicraft production, vocational
 training and other services. The West Bank-wide Society for
 the Preservation of the Family is active in supporting women's
 needs.
