 EGYPT
 President Sadat's liberalization policies in the political,
 economic and social spheres of life were largely maintained
 in 1979; but application of these reforms in the political
 sphere was uneven. There were allegations of interference
 in parliamentary elections and some limitations were im-
 posed on political critics. The government took positive
 action to expand women's rights. The government remains
 committed to the provision of basic human needs of Egyptians,
 including adequate sustenance, shelter, health care, and
 education.
 1.   Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 Torture is strictly forbidden under Egyptian law, and these
 laws are respected in practice. Any individual who claims
 to have been tortured after arrest has the right to redress
 in the courts. The Department of State is aware of only
 one allegation of physical mistreatment reported to the
 courts during the past year. It was referred to medical
 authorities and judged groundless.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman and Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 The Department of State learned of no instances of cruel,
 inhuman or degrading punishment in Egypt during 1979.
 The death penalty is reserved for a limited number of
 crimes (e.g., treason and murder) and is rarely carried
 out in practice.
 c. Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 Arbitrary arrest and imprisonment are forbidden by law.
 Violations of this statute are subject to criminal charges.
 Arrests are made after lengthy investigations, and police
 charges are adjudicated by independent courts. All persons
 arrested this year were charged with violations of specific
 laws.
 d. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The right of due process and equal treatment, including a
 fair trial open to the public, is guaranteed by Egyptian
 law. Persons accused of espionage or violations of military
 security, however, are tried by military courts, which in
 most cases are closed the public.
 e. Invasion of the Home
 There are legal safeguards against arbitrary invasion of
 the home. A prior court order is required for search and
 seizure and telephone tapping. Government officials who
 violate this law are subject to criminal penalties.
 2. Governmental Policies Relating to the Fulfillment of Such
 Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care and Education:
 The Egyptian Government's policies reflect a strong concern
 for the basic needs of the people. Health care, education
 and social welfare services are available both in urban areas
 (732)
 
 
 733
 and in remote villages. The government has made a concerted
 effort over the past twenty years to spread the benefits
 of economic growth as widely as possible throughout the
 society through the use of guaranteed employment programs
 and wage and price controls within the public sector. Egypt
 has sought to maintain equitable income distribution
 standars, while at the same time liberalizing economic policy.
 The "open-door" policy initiated in 1974 is designed to
 encourage the development of the country's private sector.
 The economy has improved considerably over the last five
 years with the orientation of economic policy toward a
 more open and liberal system. The revival of private
 economic initiative has helped to raise the general level
 of activity after long years of economic stagnation under
 the centrally planned system established by President Nasser.
 At the same time, this evolution has benefited primarily
 a relatively small economic elite of private entrepreneurs
 and has only begun to filter down to the levels of middle-
 class Egyptians. When coupled with high rates of inflation,
 the result has been an increase in income disparities.
 While the government remains reluctant to implement fiscal
 and budgetary reforms, some progress towards improving
 procedures and instituting reforms and controls over public
 sector entities has been made.
 More important, however, is the current effort to streamline
 the subsidy, ration card and price control systems with
 a view toward eliminating corrupt practices associated with
 supplying basic commodities to the public. Extralegal
 payments for services are a fact of life in Egypt. Usually
 petty, they can sometimes by substantial. This pervasive
 practice has a debilitating effect on the economy.
 Sensitive to the problem, the government has sought to
 curb the practice. The government is continuing to investigate
 charges that a former minister accepted a bribe from a major
 foreign firm and has announced its intention to prosecute
 the individual concerned if its investigation produces facts
 which merit such action.
 The living standards of the poorer classes are very low,
 and President Sadat has emphasized that food and housing
 are the government's two highest domestic priorities.
 Egypt currently spends about 20% "of its national income to
 subsidize basic necessities (food, clothing, housing) to
 assure that they are affordable by the poor. While there
 remains much room for improvement of basic services, the
 government spends some $500 million annually on free health
 and education services.
 3. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 The press in Egypt is under the influence of the government.
 Television and radio are state-controlled. Legally con-
 stituted political parties are permitted to publish their.
 own journals, but editors are expected to exercise self-
 censorship and responsibility in the national interest.
 Journalists who oppose the government's internal and
 foreign policies rarely see their articles in print, at
 least in major publications.
 
 
 A law enacted on June 2, 1978, gave the government broad
 powers to ban publication of newspapers and journals deemed
 to conflict with the national interest. Publications are
 also subject to sporadic confiscation. The leftist weekly
 Al-Ahali has suspended publication. Opposition journals
 of centrist parties continue publication, notably Al-Ahrar
 and Al-Shaab. The government proposed the creation -of a
 higher press council to monitor the press. The initial
 draft legislation was opposed by the majority of journalists
 and is being rewritten with the assistance of the working
 press.
 According to its constitution, Egypt is an Islamic state
 which guarantees freedom of religious expression. The
 provision of a June 1978 statute which bans from public
 office those advocating an ideology conflicting with
 religion (aimed primarily at communists and atheists)
 has not been tested in the courts.
 The large Coptic minority participates fully in the life
 of the country. While allegations that the government
 discriminates against its Coptic citizens have been made,
 the Department of State has no evidence of officially
 inspired or sanctioned acts of religious discrimination.
 The religious communities in Egypt generally respect each
 other, but there have been instances of communal violence
 in the past. These incidents are described by Egyptian
 Coptic leaders as isolated and the result of local tensions.
 President Sadat has appointed several members of the
 Coptic community to important cabinet posts (a deputy
 prime minister and the Minister of State for Foreign
 Affairs are Copts). The President and other senior
 officials also have stressed the need for religious
 tolerance on numerous occasions.
 Following the "subsidy-riots" in January 1977, laws were
 enacted to limit the right of assembly and to penalize
 those who strike or demonstrate against the national interest.
 Numerous arrests were made at that time. Though most of
 those arrested have been released, an undetermined number
 of individual cases have apparently yet to be completed in
 the courts. Legislation enacted on June 2, 1978, gave the
 government broad powers to investigate and penalize certain
 categories of individuals whose activities were deemed to
 conflict with the national interest and/or disturb social
 peace.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel and Emigration
 Egyptians are free to travel anywhere within their country
 (with the exception of certain military areas). The govern-
 ment also permits visitors to travel freely in Egypt. All
 Egyptians are free to emigrate.   Since the establishment
 of the State of Israel, the Jewish population of Egypt has
 declined from about 80,000 to about 250. Relations between
 the Jewish community and the government are good, although
 there are individual complaints of bureaucratic pressure
 from some people seeking to emigrate to Israel. Such immi-
 gration is likely to become easier as relations are normalized.
 c. Freedom to participate in the Political Process
 
 
 Egypt has universal suffrage. A former requirement that
 new political parties must be represented by 20 members
 of the People's Assembly recently was dropped. New pro-
 visions, however, require that any new party have at least
 50 founders, half of them workers and peasants; that the
 program of the new party must be submitted to a seven-
 member parties committee; and that the new party's platform
 must be distinguishable from those of existing parties
 and consistent with the Egyptian constitution. Political
 organizations based on religious or class lines are .not
 permitted. This restriction excludes Islamic societies
 and communists from organizing into political parties. Islamic
 religious organizations retain a quasi-legal status as long
 as they refrain from formal political activity. The People's
 Assembly has 392 members, 352 elected. Ten are appointed by
 the President, and 30 seats (all elected) are reserved for
 women. The overwhelming victory of President Sadat's newly
 formed National Democratic Party in the special parliamentary
 elections of June 1979 sparked charges that the government
 had manipulated the balloting. The NDP won more than 300
 seats; the opposition Socialist Labor Party about 30; the
 Socialist Liberals 3; other opposition parties were eliminated
 except for a small group of independents.
 Although keeping the broad outlines of his liberalization
 program intact, President Sadat in the past year has in-
 creased government control of the press and has reacted
 strongly against perceived threats from communist/leftist
 and other political opponents. In March, forty-six persons
 were arrested for membership in the outlawed communist party
 and for organizing activities to protest the Egyptian-Israeli
 Peace Treaty. These cases are now in the courts. In August,
 police arrested an estimated fifty to sixty persons, charging
 them with membership in a clandestine communist organization.
 The court ordered their release and their cases are also
 proceeding through the Egyptian judicial system.
 The status of women in Egyptian society is relatively high
 and Egyptian women enjoy virtually all civil and legal
 rights. Women vote, may volunteer for non-combat duty in
 the Armed Forces, engage in economic activities outside the
 home, and exercise other rights of citizenship. Women are
 especially well-represented in medicine, law, and education.
 All recent cabinets have included at least one woman and
 most ministries have at least one woman at the undersecretary
 level. A recently decreed amendment to the electoral law
 establishes 30 seats for women. President Sadat hag-been a
 strong advocate of women's rights and this year decreed a
 revision in the personal status law for the Muslim community
 to give women important rights in the areas of child custody,
 divorce and child support. The revised law came under
 heated criticism from some conservative religious leaders,
 but was supported publicly by the Sheikh of Al Azhar, the
 Islamic world's leading educational institution. Practical
 effects of the new law will be determined by actual court
 decisions. Despite these positive advances, women generally
 still suffer some discrimination, particularly in rural
 areas and within the more traditional communities.
 The organized trade union movement has about 7.5 million
 members. Independence and freedom of action of labor
 unions has steadily increased in recent years. Most industry
 in Egypt is at least partially government owned. Consequently,
 trade union influence in the government has helped union
 leaders in negotiating with these industries and with regard
 
 
 736
 to labor and economic legislation in the People's Assembly.
 The government has some limited say in identifying
 candidates for positions of leadership in the labor move-
 ment. Final selection among such candidates is determined
 by election. An example of the unions' relative indepen-
 dence was the election of a self-proclaimed leftist, who
 once had been accused of espionage links with Bulgaria, to
 a major union post. Workers do not enjoy the right to
 strike, but occasional wild-cat strikes have occurred in
 recent years.
 4. Government Attitude and Record Regarding International
 and Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights:
 The government is willing to permit visits by international
 groups wishing to investigate human rights concerns in Egypt.
 Most recently, as noted in the 1979 Amnesty International
 Report, a representative of Amnesty International attended
 a trial proceeding in April 1978.
