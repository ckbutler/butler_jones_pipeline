 GUATEMALA
 Guatemala's 1985 Constitution calls for election by universal suffrage of a one-
 term President, a unicameral Congress, and municipal officers; it mandates an inde-
 pendent judiciary and a human rights ombudsman, who is elected by and reports
 to Congress. Midway through his 5-year term after rising street protests, President
 Jorge Serrano suspended several sections of the Constitution and dissolved Con-
 gress and the Supreme and Constitutional Courts on May 25. After extremely nega-
 tive domestic and international reaction to this extraconstitutional move, Serrano
 was peacefully and constitutionally dismissed on June 1. Congress and the courts
 were called back into session, and on June 5, Congress, as prescribed by the Con-
 stitution, elected then Human Rights Ombudsman Ramiro de Leon Carpio to finish
 Serrano's presidential term, which ends in January 1996.
 The armed forces operate with considerable institutional and legal autonomy, par-
 ticularly in security and military matters. President de Leon Carpio, as Commander
 in Chief, replaced two Defense Ministers with officers of his own choosing. The
 43,000-man army, which has responsibility for national security, has fought a leftist
 insurgency for more tha:i three decades. The National Police (12,000 strong) and
 Treasury Police (2,000) report to the Interior Minister and share responsibility for
 internal security with the army. A target of frequent criticism by human rights
 groups, the "Hunapu" anticrime task force patrols-composed of National Police,
 Treasury Police, and Mobile Military Police (PMA)-were eliminated during the
 year. However, in December, as part of a Christmastime anticrime effort, limited
 joint patrols were reinstituted in some communities. The new President appointed
 National Police chief in August, as well as other civilians to senior posi-
 tions in the police and Ministry of Interior, and removed all military personnel from
 the police on August 27. Some 500,000 men serve in voluntary civil self-defense
 committees, commonly called Civil Defense Patrols (PAC's), some of which conduct
 counterinsurgency patrols in roral areas. The Human Rights Ombudsman and the
 Catholic Archbishop's Human Rights Office report that some PAC members were
 compelled to join the patrols, in violation of the Constitution. Security forces and
 especially PAC' committed numerous serious human rights violations in 1993.
 The agricultur-based, private sector-oriented economy was projected to grow ap-
 proximately 4 percent in 1993, which would produce an increase in per capita in-
 come of about 1 percent. Inflaticn was expected to reach 12 percent. Guatemala has
 negotiated a shadow agreement with the International Monetary Fund, despite fis-
 cal and monetary difficulties. There is a marked disparity in income distribution
 and poverty is pervasive, particularly in the large indigenous community.
 Although there were improvements in the human rights situatio n 1993, serious
 abuses occurred frequently. Statistics prepared by the Archbishop's Human Rights
 Office showed an increase in extrajudicial killings as of mid-December and a sub-
 stantial increase in forced disappearances, with no improvement in other categories.
 Many of these violations occurred in the latter half of the year. The civil patrols,
 military, and police cc.ntinued to commit a majority of the major violations, includ-
 ing extrajudica l killings, political kidnapings, and death threats. The seriousness
 of the continuing violations was underlined by the circulation in March of a "death
 
 
 449
 list" containing 24 names and another in October with 23 names. However, no one
 on either list was kidnaped or killed.
 The election of President de Leon Carpio, the highly respected former human
 rights ombudsman raised hopes there would be a rapid improvement in the human
 rights situation. The new President encouraged human rights groups and showed
 a willingness to investigate abuses and to make structural changes, such as disman-
 tling the 'Archivos" presidential intelligence unit and restructuring the police, in-
 cludlng creation of a special police unit to investigate all cases of forced disappear-
 ances, extrajudicial killings, and other violations of a political nature allegedly com-
 mitted by the police. Nevert he   ese changes failed to reduce the actual number
 of abuses allegedly committed by government f'orcs. The 33-year-old internal insur-
 gency continued to be a major cause of human rights violations. Both the security
 forces and the guerrillas committed numerous and serious human rights abuses.
 Guerrilla abuses included extrajudcial killings, kidnapings, forced labor recruit-
 ment, widespread use of mines and explosivesn civilian areas, and the use of chil-
 dren in combat. Guerrilla attacks on infrastructure targets continued throughout
 the year.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-Politically motivated killings contin-
 ued in 1993, and with few exceptions the Government failed to investigate them
 fully or to detain and prosecute the perpetrators of extrajudicial killings. Full-year
 statistics from  the Human Rights Ombudsman's Office listed 14 cases of
 extrajudicial killings, with 146 other cases under investigation. This compares with
 48 confirmed extrajudicial killings in 1992, with 318 under investigation. The Arch-
 bishop's Human Rights Office reported 239 extrajudicial killings up to mid-Decem-
 ber 1993 as compared to 204 in 1992 but did not break down the figures according
 to the responsible organization.
 The security forces and persons associated with or protected by the army such
 as the Civil Defense Patrols or military commissioners, committed a number of
 these killings, many of which took place in areas of guerrilla conflict. The Ombuds-
 man, the Attorney General, and human rights groups have found evidence of
 killings by PAC's. PAC leaders are feared in many rural communities. They enjoy
 army backing and often immunity from prosecution. Likewise, members of the secu-
 rity forces ar rarely held accountable for human rights violations.
 Civil patrols continued to be especially responsible for human rights violations, in-
 cluding the killing of human rights activists. PAC's threatened and killed members
 ofthe Runujel Junam Council of Ethnic Communities (CERJ), a rural-based human
 rights organization dedicated mainly to opposing involuntary service in PAC's.
 Tomas Lares Cipriano, a CERJ and United Peasants Committee (CUC) member in
 Joyabaj, was killed on April 30 by PAC members, according to family members and
 witnesses.
 Ten persons, from two separate families, took refuge in the Santa Cruz del Quiche
 CERJ office on June 10 after being threatened with death for not participating in
 PAC's and for being CERJ members. On October 14, 3 of the 10 left the CERJ of-
 fices under police protection and resettled in a town without a PAC. The other seven
 returned to their original community in early January. Charges against CERJ lead-
 er Amilcar Mendez for allegedly providing explosives to guerrillas in October 1992
 were dropped in March. Captain Anibal Roberto Landaveri, Commander of the
 Chiul, Quiche, stockade, was arrested in May for having three CERJ members beat-
 en on his base. He was dismissed from the army and tried for illegal detention,
 abuse of authority, coercion, and causing injuries. In addition to being dismissed,
 he was found guilty and sentenced to 2  years in prison and payment of damages
 to those harmed. However, the sentence was suspended by the military court, which
 has the discretion to do so when a light sentence is imposed.
 On August 3, Huehuetenango PAC members fired on marchers demanding the
 dissolution of the civil patrols, killing Juan Chonay Pablo and wounding two others.
 Five PAC members have been questioned by the authorities for Chonay's murder,
 with one still remaining in jail. Ten arrest warrants for other PAC members remain
 outstanding. Witnesses subsequently reported receiving threats from PAC members.
 PAC leader Efrain Domingo Morales, from the town of Xemal in the same area, was
 murdered by unknown persons in mid-September. A surviving family member re-
 ,rted that PAC members killed two peasants from Xemal, Colotenango, on Septem-
 Former Corporal Nicolas Gutierrez Cruz, convicted in the January 17, 1992, kill-
 ing of four persons in Ciudad Peronia, exhausted his legal appeals on July 23 when
 
 
 450
 
 the Constitutional Court denied his request to void his death sentence. In early Oc-
 tober, President de Leon Carpio commuted his sentence to 30 years, the maximum
 legally possible. A fellow ex-soldier convicted in the killings escaped on May 9, 1992;
 in May 1993, an appellate court sentenced an army enlisted man to 2 years in pris-
 on for negligence in allowing the escape. On March 19, the then Human Rights Om-
 budsman de Leon Carpio accused army troops of responsibility for the August 31,
 1992, kidnaping, torture, and murder of Huehuetenango peasant Lucas Perez
 Tadeo. Although the army premised a full investigation, no results were reported
 by year's end.
 On May 1, civil patrol members in Jocopilas surrounded a house and killed 11
 inhabitants (as well as an unborn child). Many of the 11 were known as criminals
 in the community and, the day of their deaths, are said to have robbed one family
 and raped three women. Police arrived prior to the killings but left after being in-
 timidated by the local PAC.
 On the Government's appeal of an earlier acquittal, Quiche PAC chiefs Manuel
 Perebal Ajtzalam and Manuel Leon Lares were sentenced to 30 years in prison for
 the February 17, 1991, killing of Juan Perebal Xirum and his son and the injuring
 of another son. Those attacked had testified against Perebal in the case of Sebastian
 Velasquez Mejia, a community leader opposed to the PAC's who was kidnaped and
 later found dead.
 Persons associated with the security forces were responsible for vigilante killings.
 According to the Casa Alianza, an organization that fosters protection of the human
 rights of street children, street children Henry Yubani Alvarez and Francisco Tziac
 were shot in downtown Guatemala City on April 17 and 22. Casa Alianza believes
 that a private security guard killed Alvarez and off-duty military commissioners
 wounded Tziac, both shot possibly due to petty thievery. On May 11, a congressional
 bodyguard shot a student protesting at the Congress. He died a day later, the body-
 guard who allegedly killed him remains a fugitive.
 There was some progress in certain past high-profile cases. Former government
 security agent Noel de Jesus Beteta Alvarez was sentenced in February to 30 years
 in prison for the 1990 murder of Guatemalan anthropologist Myrna Mack Chang
 and the unrelated beating of a minor. The conviction is now being appealed, with
 plaintiff Helen Mack also seeking prosecution of the alleged military "intellectual
 authors" of the crime. On September 1, Myrna Mack's former workplace was broken
 into and death threats left against Helen Mack. On September 23, Beteta briefly
 escaped from jail but was recaptured 5 hours later and charged in the escape.
 On May 11, an appellate court sentenced Captain Hugo Contreras to 20 years for
 planning the 1990 kidnaping that led to the death of U.S. citizen Michael Devine
 and confirmed the 30-year sentences for six enlisted men. After hearing the verdict,
 however, Contreras escaped from military custody and remains at large. While the
 circumstances of his escape suggested complicity by the military, the only punish-
 ment was a 2-year suspended sentence given to an enlisted man for not being at
 his post when Contreras escaped. Senior officers accused of covering up the case
 have not been brought to trial.
 On August 18, an appeals court sentenced 22 former police officers, who formed
 part of a "Hunapu" patrol, to 30 years in prison for the April 10, 1992, death of
 university student Julio Rigoberto Cu Quim and for injuring six other students. Ear-
 lier, on July 22, seven PMA members of the same patrol were given sentences of
 14 years (4 commutable) for the crime.
 There was no progress in resolving numerous other cases of past extrajudicial
 killings, including the 1988 "white van" case, the1989 disappearances and murders
 of university students, the 1990 Hector Oqueli Colindres and Gilds Flores killings,
 the 1990 disappearance of Maria Tiu Tojin and her daughter, the 1991 murder of
 police detective Jose Luis Merida Escobar, the 1991 disappearance of Diego Do-
 mingo Martin, or past kidnapings and murders of various CERJ members. On May
 5, an appeals court upheld a lower court decision to dismiss charges against six
 military defendants for the 1991 "Traileros" killings in Taxisco. The decision was
 appealed. The Government's frequent inability to control or sanction those respon-
 sible for human rights offenses is a major impediment to human rights progress.
 b. Disappearance.-The Archbishop's Human Rights Office reported 46 forced dis-
 appearances during 1993, as compared with 11 in 1992. Seventeen were either Ia-
 beled or presumed to be political in nature. Reports linked many political disappear-
 ances to persons connected with the armed forces. The Ombudsman's Office listed
 2 cases of forced disappearances, with 29 others under investigation at year's end.
 This compares with the Ombudnan's 1992 statistics of 10 confirmed forced dis-
 appearances and 62 cases still under investigation. The Government did not identify
 or prosecute the perpetrators of any of these disappearances.
 
 
 In August the wife of guerrilla Efrain Bamaca claimed he was being held in a
 clandestine prison after results of an exhumation of his supposed grave proved neg-
 ative. The army denied this, though it has admitted in the _past to housing former
 guerrillas who cooperate with the armed forces on military bases. One of these ex-
 guerrillas, Angel Osorio, was killed on August 19 by members of the Guatemala Na.
 tional Revolutionary Unity (URNG) puerrilla coalition when he was stopped at a
 guerrilla roadblock after leaving a Quiche military base to visit his family.
 Guerrilla forces kidnaped San Marcos PAC members Margarito Lopez and
 Obdulio Zapeta on August 7 and Diego Chel Matom, an army enlisted man riding
 a bus in Quiche 3 days later. In early December, the press reported that 10 persons
 dressed in the manner of URNG guerrillas approached Ramona Munoz and Maritza
 Gil as they were working on their Santa Rose farm and took them to nearby moun-
 tains under threat of death. The whereabouts of all these persons were unknown
 as of years end.
 c. Torture arid Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution protects the integrity and security of the person. However, as in
 past years, many bodies were found throughout Guatemala bearing signs of severe
 dlisfigurement or postmortem mutilation. The Human Rights Ombudsman's Office
 listed seven cases of torture in 1993. The Archbishop's Human Rights Office listed
 nine cases of torture through mid-December. In one case, a male student was picked
 up by three unidentified men on March 27, ')eaten unconscious, held for 3 days, and
 asked about student leaders. In April a female victim was also beaten unconscious
 but apparently was not asked any questions.
 There were other credible reports of mistreatment by security forces, including
 use of excessive force by police at the time of arrest and of abusive treatment of
 persons in rural areas by the army Civil Defense Patrols, military commissioners,
 and police. The Government often failed to investigate or take any other action in
 response to such reports. Although action was rarely taken, cases of rape traced to
 individual soldiers were reported.
 Casa Alianza the organization dedicated to street children, reported in March
 that street child Julio Cesar Reyes was picked up by two persons he recognized as
 policemen and burned on his arm 29 times with a cigarette. On May 23, a street
 child reported having acid thrown at him by the police. There were numerous other
 reports of policemen beating or illegally detaining street children; the authorities
 rarely took action in any of these instances.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Despite legal safeguards, there were fre-
 quent credible reports of arbitrary arrest by the security forces, incommunicado de-
 tention, and failure to adhere to the prescribed time limits for legal procedures. A
 court-issued arrest warrant is required unless a person is caught in the act of com-
 mitting a crirne. Police may not detain a suspect for over 6 hours without bringing
 him before a judge. The law provides for bail,access to lawyers, and limits to 20
 days the time anyone may be held. After that period, a detainee must be charged
 or freed, and the authorities must produce detainees on court request.
 Some persons detained illegally reported having been held at safe houses alleg-
 edly operated by security forces. Those responsible for illegal detentions routinely
 ignore writs of habeas corpus. The Archbishop's Human Rights Office charged that
 prisoners are sometimes not released in a timely fashion after completing their sen-
 tences due to the failure of judges to issue the necessary court order.
 Investigations during the Serrano presidency into the activities of former Izabal
 department governor Lilian Vasquez de Guzman and alleged corruption by former
 Health Minister Miguel Montepeque appeared politically motivated. Montepeque
 was subsequently cleared of char s; Vasquez de Guzman went into self-imposed
 temporary exile in mid-February. The problem of politically motivated investigations
 lessened after the accession of de Leon Carpio to the presidency.
 Exile is prohibited under the Constitution and is not practiced.
 e. Deiof Fair Public Trial.-The judicial system is ineffective and often unable
 to ensure a fair trial (see below). The Constitution provides for an independent judi-
 ciary composed of a Constitutional Court, a Supreme Court appeals courts, and sev-
 eral courts of special jurisdiction, such as labor courts. flowever, military courts
 have jurisdiction over military personnel, including military commissioners who
 commit crimes while on official business, thus limiting the ability of civil courts to
 prosecute persons under military control in human rights abuse cases. PAC mem-
 bers are civilians and not under military jurisdiction.
 Civilian trials are public after the first 15 days, which are dedicated to an initial
 investigative phase that is closed. Defendants have the right to be present at trials
 and to legal representation. An appeals court automatically reviews convictions. The
 Criminal Procedure Code is being changed to introduce oral proceedings (in both
 Spanish and indigenous languages) open to the public and to establish a viable pub-
 
 
 lic defender program. To allow more time for training and compliance, however, in
 December the effective date of the new Criminal Procedure Code was postponed
 until July 1994.
 Most human rights violations are not investigated; security force personnel are re-
 luctant to investigate cases involving colleagues. Police are also relatively few in
 number and lack resources and training. Judges are susceptible to intimidation and
 corruption and suffer from low pay, bad working conditions, and low morale. The
 Supreme Court and some lower court judges came under public pressure to resign
 for corruption and politicization of the legal system.
 Some judges succeeded in being excused from hearing prominent cases by alleging
 they had received death threats. A total of 12 different judges were excused from
 the Myrna Mack Chang case, for example. The appals court judges who heard the
 Mack, Devine, and "Trailers" cases reported having received threats in 1993. In ad-
 dition, officials from the Attorney General's and Human Rights Ombudsman's of.
 fices, including the Ombudsman himself, have received threats.
 Charges continue to be made publicly that the Supreme Court pressures lower
 court judges to decide cases in line with its wishes. In January the Constitutional
 Court ruled that the Supreme Court practice of arbitrarily transferring justices was
 unconstitutional, limiting one means of interfering in lower court cases.
 There are no known political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution provides for the inviolability of home, correspondence, and private doc-
 uments, but these provisions are not always respected. Element. of the security
 forces continue to monitor private communications. Many human rights monitors re-
 ported receiving threats in the form of surveillance, telephone calls, and anonymous
 letters.
 On March 26, the Guatemalan postal workers union and the Human Rights Om-
 budsman exposed a secret government mail interception unit located at the central
 post office. The Ombudsman attributed responsibility for the letter-opening oper-
 ation to the presidential intelligence unit known as "Archivos," which was later dis-
 banded.
 Officials enforcing the military draft continued to enter homes and places of busi-
 ness without legally required court orders. The army attempted to curb such abuses
 in Quiche by setting up a draft board consisting of the zone military commander,
 the local representative of the Human Rights Ombudsman's office, and other civilian
 leaders. Under recruitment practices also adopted in other departments potential
 draftees receive three induction notices, after which they are arrested if they do not
 report for enlistment. Under Guatemalan law, such arrests must be effected pursu-
 ant to a court order.
 Credible reports of forced recruitment continued, however, particularly in late
 January. On July 27, in what was said to be the first case of its kind outside a city,
 Jalapa peasant Juan Engel Morales Lima filed suit claiming he was a victim of
 forced recruitment. In September Alvaro Enrique Madrid Matta was released from
 the army due to his being a minor after the Human Rights Ombudsman filed suit
 on September 14, asserting he had been forcibly recruited in August.
 The Constitution requires that PAC service be voluntary. However, army officers,
 military commissioners, and PAC leaders often pressure men in areas of conflict to
 become PAC members. There were credible reports that some who refused to serve
 were killed or suffered other abuses.
 g. Use of Excessive Force and Violations of Humanitarian Law in Internal Con-
 flicts.-Guatemala's armed internal conflict entered its 33rd year in 1993 and con-
 tinued to be a major cause of human rights violations by both government and guer-
 rilla forces. After a promising first half of the year, peace talks collapsed in early
 May. Human rights issues and the timing of a proposed cease-fire were primary
 areas of disagreement. The de Leon Carpio Government sought to renew the peace
 talks under a format allowing greater participation by other groups in Guatemalan
 society. Talks resumed under U.N. auspices in January 1994.
 Communities of People in Resistance (CPR) claimed army harassment throughout
 the year, including late evening helicopter overflights and restriction of commerce.
 On February 27, Episcopal Conference Secretary Bishop Ramazzini announced that
 some 500 Guatemalaos gad fled to Mexico to avoid army operations in Cuarto Pueb-
 lo, Quiche. They later returned. On August 23, two former PAC members stated
 that PAC leaders and a military officer had forced them earlier in the year to harass
 a CPR. In September President de Leon Carpio met with a CPR delegation to dis-
 cuss their complaints. CPR leaders announced the intention or their communities
 to live openly, establishing permanent settlements in 1994.
 Bombings conducted by unknown perpetrators continued, with targets including
 former President Serrano's Solidarity Action Movement party headquarters and the
 
 
 453
 headquarters of the Christian Democratic Party. Four banks were also bombed, and
 numerous rural electrical towers were blown up in January and February. Further
 bombings occurred in September, apparently tied to a political struggle involving ef-
 forts to remove allegedly corrupt Congressmen and Supreme Court officials from of-
 fice. Commercial institutions, Christian Democratic Party headquarters, the Guate-
 malan Jurists Association, and the offices of the Mutual Support Group (GAM-a
 human rights group active in the removal effort), were targets. Shots also were fired
 near GAM leader Nineth Montenegro de Garcia's home on September 11; some con-
 gressional deputies and the Supreme Court president also reported death threats.
 o one was apprehended for these attacks and threats.
 Guerrilla forces continued to recruit children into their ranks. Government troops
 found a 10-year-old child guerrilla after an armed engagement near Raxhuja, Alta
 Verapa, on March 9. The wounded child was evacuated to a Guatemala City mili-
 tary hospital. In another instance, on June 17, 13-year-old Mario Ixcal was captured
 near La Libertad, Peten, after being wounded in an army-guerrilla clash. Treated
 and released to the Ombudsman's office, Ixcal said his URNG unit contained two
 other young boys. Documented cases of civilians being injured by guerrilla mines
 also occurred in 1993.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of expres-
 sion. However, radio and television station owners charge that licensing and re-
 newal procedures have been used to threaten stations critical of the Government,
 security forces, or powerful individuals. When Serrano was President, newspapers
 also complained about government interference, especially efforts to silence criticism
 of the President, his family, and alleged wrongdoing by security forces. On February
 4, newspaper columnist Marta Altoaguirre's father's automobile was attacked by a
 group of heavily armed men. Although neither her father nor driver were injured,
 Altoaguirr, an outspoken critic of then President Serrano, characterized the attack
 as an effort to intimidate her.
 While journalists assert that they operate more freely under the de Leon adminis-
 tration than they have at any other time in recent history, threats and attacks on
 journalists continued. On July 3, Jorge Carpio Nicolle, El Grafico publisher and a
 political party leader was shot and killed by a grup of armed men while traveling
 along a highway in 4uetzaltenango. On December 24, Victor Manuel de la Cruz, a
 reporter for Radio Sonora, was shot and subsequently died in Guatemala City. Both
 cases remained unsolved at year's end, although the Government claims motivation
 for the attacks was criminal, not political.
 On August 1, unknown individuals fired on the offices of the daily newspaper
 Siglo X    Despite President de Leon's personal interest, this case also remained un-
 solved at year's end. Five days later, three police officers threatened two journalists
 covering a student disturbance. The new police director disciplined the three offi-
 cers, and one is currently awaiting trial for this threat. In mid-August, a television
 journalist who interviewed two senior URNG officials received threats.
 On October 8, Oscar Masaya, director of a cable television news program, was se-
 verely beaten in Guatemala City. On October 28, 10 journalists were beaten by un-
 known individuals when they attempted to cover a press conference being given by
 activists occupying the Congress. During November the weekly Cronica reported re-
 ceiving a threat that it should pay protection money to an alleged URNG represent-
 ative. On November 25, newspaper editor Carlos Rigalt Cervantes was shot and
 pursued by persons in a car that moments earlier had struck the auto he was driv-
 ing. A number of journalists, including the director of Tinamit magazine, also re-
 ported receiving death threats throughout the year. Several were included on a 24-
 person "death list" that appeared in late March or on a separate list that appeared
 in early October.
 Newspapers, magazines, and radio and television stations were subjected to cen-
 sorship when President Serrano announced his May 25 extraconstitutional actions.
 Radio and television stations also were forced to broadcast standardized government
 programming for extended periods. Security forces seized several thousand copies of
 the Cronica magazine issue reporting Serrano's actions, which were found burned
 by a roadside in late July. A number of journalists refused to cooperate with au-
 thorities during the coup; they were not harmed as censorship quickly broke down
 and a free press returned after Serrano's fall.
 Despite harassment, the news media reported all major human rights stories and
 publicized communiques from the URNG, leftist groups, and others opposed to the
 Government or its policies. Both major press associations denounced incidents re-
 stricting freedom of the press and vowed to continue coverage of sensitive topics.
 Journalists admit, however, that self-censorship stemming from fear of reprisal con-
 
 
 454
 tinues to impede full investigative reporting on a variety of topics, including alleged
 government human rights violations, corruption of government officials and influen-
 tial politicians, aspects of narcotics trafficking, and issues affecting the economic in-
 terests of powerful individuals.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution guarantees
 the right of peaceful assembly and association, but authorities banned rallies and
 broke up a demonstration following Serrano's May 25 coup. Prior to the coup, there
 was a plethora of demonstrations, some involving violence between police and
 marchers. Some demonstrators also claimed later harassment by security forces in
 retribution for their participation in the marches. Street demonstrations were a fac-
 tor in focusing public disapproval on Serrano's actions. With his exit from office,
 constitutional guarantees of peaceful assembly and association were restored.
 Freedom of political asL.xciation is guaranteed under the Constitution, although
 organizations ar nominally required to obtain legal status, a cumbersome and ex-
 pensive procedure. In mid-December, the Government announced a streamlining of
 these procedures.
 c.  reedom   of Religion.-No   state religion  exists. Religious freedom  is
 constitutionallyguaranteed and is respected in practice. Religious personnel are
 sometimes threatened for political reasons. About 70 per cent of the population is
 nominally Catholic, but many other faiths operate freely, especially evangelical Prot-
 estLentism.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Government does not restrict foreign travel, nor does it revoke citi-
 zenship for political reasons. Movement inside the country was unrestricted except
 where the army and PAC's limited travel in some areas of conflict. Guerrillas con-
 tinued to establsh roadblocks, assault private citizens to demand "war taxes," at-
 tack and drain petroleum t-ucks, and limit travel in certain rural areas.
 Repatriation of refugees continud. By the end of 1993, 5,135 refigees had been
 repatriated to Guatemala In December a large group of approximately 1,300 refu-
 gees returned to a conflic.-torn zone that was originally their home.
 On August 25, a representative of the Guatemalan refugee community in Mexico,
 Joaquin Jimenez Bautista, was beaten by a crowd including PAC members in Todos
 Santos, Iuehuetenango. Jimenez had returned to Guatemala on August 17 as part
 of a refugee group searching for resettlement sites. On the day of the beating, he
 had left the group, returning for a visit to his former village. Crowd members later
 formally charged that Jimenez was a known guerrilla, who participated in murders
 in that town in the 1980's. Jimenez was briefly detained by -lice after a military
 patrol prevented the mob from lynching him. Jimenez was released by order of the
 Minister of Government and returned to Mexico on August 26.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Guatemalans have the right to change their government by peaceful and demo-
 cratic means. Universal suffrage by secret ballot exists for those 18 years of age and
 older; there are no property or literacy requirements, but members of the armed
 forces and police may not vote. The last national eleciions, which international ob-
 servers found free and fair, were held in January 1991.
 Following the removal of President Serrano and Vice President Espina, Ramiro
 de Leon Carpio was elected President by a congressional vote and sworn in on June
 6, as prescribed by the Constitution. Congress elected Arturo Herbruger, who was
 head of Guatemala's independent Supreme Electoral Tribunal until retiring in early
 June, as Vice President on June 18.
 Several women hold prominent political positions, including three Cabinet posts.
 Six of 116 members of Congress are female; 2 women are Supreme Court justices.
 A few women also hold important positions in political parties. Of the over 300 mu-
 nicipalities in Guatemala, women serve as mnayors in only 5 (there had been no fe-
 male mayors prior to the May elections in 276 small municipalities). There are no
 legal impediments to    women's participation  in  politics, but females  are
 underrepresented in the political arena. As of March 1990, 60 percent of registered
 voters were men and 40 percent women, despite women being slightly more numer-
 ous thair men in the general population.
 Indigenous people enjoy equal rights under the Constitution, and some have at-
 tained positions as Congressmen, army officers (including one general), government
 officials, and judges. Nevertheless, pervasive discrimination (see Section 5) limits
 opportunities for indigenous people to assume prominent roles in politics.

 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Local human rights groups are permitted to operate, but members suffered
 threats and violence from security forces and PAC's. A greater tolerance for their
 activity exists since the de Leon administration took office. As noted in Section L.a
 members of the human rights organization CERJ were killed and threatened, and
 CERJ's Guatemala City office was broken into on May 8. CONAVIGUA, an indige-
 nous widows' organization prominent in the advocacy of women's and human rights
 issues also received threats. Prior to the midyear change in administrations, Presi-
 dent errano and members of his Cabinet criticized both local and international
 human rights groups, accusing them of intentionally distorting Guatemala's human
 rights record or political purposes. High-ranking government officials working in
 the fields of human rights and jurisprudence complained publicly and privately of
 receiving threats stemming from their interest in resolving cases related to human
 rights violations, official corruption, and drug trafficking.
 Relations between the executive branch and the Ombudsman's office were tense
 at times in the first half of the year, though, after the election of de Leon Carpio
 as President, matters improved considerably. The Ombudsman's office continued to
 enjoy widespread public support and respect; Congress elected Jorge Mario Garcia
 Laguardia as the new Human Rights Ombudsman to replace de Leon Carpio. The
 new Government made clear its willingness and commitment to receive inter-
 national and domestic human rights groups. Senior officials met numerous foreign
 and international officials and activists.
 The Peace Brigades, an international human rights monitoring organization, was
 unable to obtain government recognition despite persistent efforts. The absence of
 legal status did not, however, prevent Peace Brigades or other human rights organi-
 zations from operating openly.
 On June 17, union activist Elizabeth Recinos was kidnaped, alongwith a compan-
 ion. Though the companion was quickly released, Recinos was held for 4 days,
 drugged, and beaten. President de Lon condemned the kidnaping and the police
 conducted an investigation, though no arrests were made. The police initially la-
 beled this a "self-kidnaping," although there were more credible claims that the ac-
 tion was meant as a threat to unions and human rights groups. On July 11, union
 official Walter Manuel Najera Molina was kidnaped and interrogated about union
 activities for 3 hours by four armed men, during which time he was beaten. During
 his questioning, Niuera was asked about various political and human rights leaders,
 whom his captives linked to the guerrillas.
 On September 1, a member of a group advocating a purge of alleged corrupt con-
 ssional and Supreme Court officials, Olga Marina Ruano Cruz, was abducted and
 eten before being released a day later.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 Women.-Despite legal protection, women face job discrimination and on average
 receive significantly lower pay than men. They are primarily employed in low wage
 jobs in the textile industry, agriculture, retail business, and the public sector. A
 mid-1991 U.N. study reported that women, although slightly more than half the
 total population, make up only 24 percent of the economically active population.
 More working women than men are employed in the informal sector of the economy,
 where pay and benefits are generally low. A 1989 survey reported that in Guate-
 mala City women are underrepresented in high-income categories and overrepre-
 sented among poorly paid workers.
 The Constitution asserts the principle of equality between the sexes. Nonetheless,
 not all domestic laws have been modified to take into account this constitutional
 rovision or to reflectthe numerous treaties bearing on the rights of women to which
 uatemala has adhered. (Provisions of such treaties take precedence over domestic
 law.) In some cases, laws remain discriminatory against women, such as the Penal
 Code's provisions on adultery. Only women may be charged with adultery while
 men fall under a different statute, which is more limited, makes it more difficult
 to prove, and carries a lesser penalty.
 CONAVIGUA reported that violence against women, including domestic violence,
 remains common but receives little attention. There is no specific law against do-
 mestic violence, although it is considered to fall under other statutes. Criminal sex-
 ual violence often goes unreported by victims, and relativelyfew rape cases come to
 court. The Ombudsman's office has only recently begun collecting statistics on this
 problem.
 Children.-When signing the U.N. Convention on the Rights of the Child, the
 Government stated its commitment to children's human rights and welfare and
 
 
 pledved to revise its laws in line with the Convention. The Human Rights Ombuds-
 man s office, along with a commission of 25 governmental and nongovernmental or-
 ganizations (NGO s), was revising the current Code but at year's end had not com-
 pleted the task.
 The abuse of street children (see Section 1.c.) is a serious problem in major cities.
 Estimates of street children range between 1,500 and 5,000, with the majority of
 these youths concentrated in Guatemala City. These children are often recruited
 into thievery or prostitution rings. The Government and a number of NGO's have
 youth centers, but the funds devoted to them are inadequate for the problem. In Au-
 gust the Government opened a school in San Jose P.nula for the rehabilitation of
 street children.
 An accord between Casa Alianza and the Attorney General's officewas not re-
 newed in 1993 due to problems involving the suspensionof the then Attorney Gen-
 eral. On August 16, the new civilian police director met with Casa Alianza as one
 of his first publicacts and expressed his commitment to the rights of street children
 and his intention to punish police officers and others who abuse them. Casa Alianza
 announced after the visit that it and the police will coordinate programs to combat
 street children's drug addiction and abuse of the children. The policedirector also
 assumed personal responsibility for the Department's Minors' Division, and the Min-
 istry of Government established a separate division to handle street children mat-
 ters.
 Indigenous People.-Indigenous people comprise one-half of the population but re-
 main largely outside the country's political, economic, social, and cultural main-
 stream. Indigenous people suffered most of the serious human rights abuses de-
 scribed throughout this report. Rural indigenous men were more likely than urban
 dwellers to be drafted by the army or forcibly recruited by either the army or guer-
 rilla groups. Although indigenous people are accorded equal rights by the Constitu-
 tion, in practice they have only minimal participation in decisions affecting their
 lands, culture, traditions, and alocation of natural resources.
 Rural indigenous people have limited educational opportunities and thus have
 limited employment opportunities. IDliteracy is prevalent in indigenous communities.
 Many indigenous people do not speak Spanish. Linguistic barriers hinder inter-
 action with the Government and limit access to publi& services, including the judici-
 ary, because few officials speak indigenous languages. Indigenous persons arrested
 for crimes are often at a disadvantage due to their lack of Spanish. The Public De-
 fender's Office is charged with providing judicial translating services but is not suffi-
 ciently staffed to cope with the problem. Under the new Penal Code, the Govern-
 ment will be required to provide translating services to all in need.
 People with Disabilities.-IThe Constitution provides that the State should protect
 disabled persons. Nonetheless, physically disabled persons are discriminated against
 in employment practices, and few resources are devoted to combat this problem or
 otherwise to assist people with disabilities. There is no legislation mandating acces-
 sibility for the disabled.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution and the 1947 Labor Code, as
 amended, provide workers freedom of association and the right to form and join
 trade unions. The Labor Code was amended in late 1992 to facilitato freedom of as-
 sociation, to strengthen the rights of working women, to increase penalties for viola-
 tions of labor laws, and to enhance the role of the Labor Ministry and labor courts
 in enforcing them. All workers have the right to form or join unions, including pub-
 lic sector employees, with the exception of members of security forces. In February
 a decree interpreting "essential services" in such a way as to restrict organizing
 public sector workers was withdrawn, following protests by public sector employees
 and the Minister of Labor. After national police officers were unsuccessful in their
 attempts to form a trade union or association during most of the year, the new Di-
 rector opened a dialog with representatives of this group. Between 5 and 8 percent
 of the work force is organized. The 890 unions in the country are independent of
 government and political party domination.
 The Labor Code amendments simplified the process for unions to obtain legal sta-
 tus, which had been criticised as excessively cumbersome, by eliminating a number
 of prvisions, including one that required the nation's President to sign the final pa-
 pers. Complaints by trade union leaders about continuing problems with the rec-
 ognition process, plus concerns expressed by the International Labor Organization
 Ln    Co   tt  of Experts, prompted the new Minister of Labor to seek revisions
 to this procedure. In November the Labor Ministry issued revised internal regula-
 tions covering the approval of new trade unions. This reduced the number of steps
 needed within the Ministry to grant approval, established strict timetables for con-
 
 
 457
 sideration of union applications, and made clear that noncompliance with this time-
 table could lead to dismissal of guilty bureaucrats.
 Experience with these new regulations during the last 2 months of 1993 seems
 to indicate they helped accelerate the approval procedure. For example, the applica-
 tion by workers at a bottling company in La Mariposa received final approva in a
 record 5 weeks. During the last half of 1993, most of the backlog of union applica-
 tions was eliminated and several previously controversial union applications were
 approved, such as the union representing Coca-Cola workers in Puerto Barrios, sev-
 eral unions representing Jmaquila (drawback, or in-bond export) workers, and the
 long-pending applcation by the union representing workers in the Bank of the
 Army (Banco del Ejerit).
 Workers have the right to strike, but Labor Code procedures make legal strikes
 cumbersome. The ILO Committee of Experts criticized the requirement that two-
 thirds of the workers vote to approve a strike and the prohibition of strikes by agri-
 cultural workers at harvest time, as well as those deemed by the Government to
 affect the national economy seriously. The few strikes that did occur were generally
 called without legal authorization, and in practice the Government made no effort
 to intervene on the basis of illegality. Nonetheless, the lack of legal sanction for a
 strike can be used as a threat against strikers. Organized labor's structural weak-
 nesses, a reluctance to organize forcefully, the paucity of membership funds, and a
 poor overall economic situation with high unemployment and underemployment
 limit the duration of virtually all strikes.
 The law protects workers from retribution for forming and participating in trade
 union activities, but compliance with the law varies. While some employers accept
 unionization, many employers routinely attempt to circumvent Labor Code provi-
 sions in order to resist union activities, which many view as exceedingly
 confrontational and disruptive. Enforcement of the right to form and participate in
 trade union activities is further hindered by an incompetent legal system and the
 inadequate level of penalties provided by law for violations. Fines for violating the
 Labor Code were increased when the Code was amended in 1992.
 Trade union leaders and individual workers reported that workers were threat-
 ened with the loss of their jobs or physical harm for their interest in forming a
 union. The International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) alleged that
 a wave of illegal and arbitrary mass firings and intimidation took place at the be-
 ginning of the year including the dismissal of 515 union members at the State For-
 est and Wildlife Oftice and the firing of 25 workers from the National Agrarian Re-
 form Institute for joining a union.
 One union leader was discharged in late 1992 by a state-owned enterprise for par-
 ticipating in a seminar sponsored by the American Federation of Labor-Congress of
 Industrial Organizations despite clear contract language that would permit such
 training. Although a lower labor court acted quickly and ordered the company to re-
 instate this leader, there was no final action on his case during the year. This case
 was unusual because union leaders and other industrial relations observers agree
 that labor courts are generally slow to hear complaints, as well as to issue decisions
 related to complaints by workers and unionists that their rights to form and join
 trade unions are not protected.
 Trade union leaders and members were among those subjected to a variety of
 abuses, such as threats, assassination attempts, kidnapings, and physical harm (see
 Section 4). A number of trade union officials or members were kidnaped during the
 year. They were generally questioned about the activities of well-known union lead-
 ers, often physically abused (but not killed), and then released. Since many of these
 incidents happened during the period just after Ramiro de Leon Carpio became
 President, these attacks seemed intended as a warning to trade unionists and other
 leaders about their increased exposure in political affairs.
 Public sector union leaders, as well as unionists in the high-profile maquila sector,
 also reported receiving threats against themselves and their families, usually coin-
 ciding with union demands for improved benefits. The ICFTU charged that many
 trade unionists were forced into or sought exile.
 By law, union leaders may serve on y one term in a particular union office, but,
 by rotating union positions, the same persons can stay on union executive boards
 for extended perio  of time. The Constitution and the 1992 Code amendmentspro-
 tect the right of political participation for individuals, including trade union leaders.
 During 1993 trade union leaders became more involved in national political affairs,
 particularly during the political turmoil following the resignation of former presi-
 dent Serrano and the move to purge Congress and the Supreme Court.
 Unions may and do form federations and confederations and join international or-
 ganizations. With very few exceptions, trade unions depend on assistance received
 from international contacts.
 
 
 458
 An active "solidarity" movement claimed approximately 100,000 members in over
 350 companies. Unions may legally continue to operate in workplaces which have
 solidarity associations, and workers have the right to choose between the two or be-
 long to both. The Government views these associations as civic organizations which
 need not interfere with the functioning of trade unions, since the amended Labor
 Code stipulates that trade unions have the exclusive right to bargain collectively
 over work conditions on behalf of workers. Unionists charge, however, that solidar-
 ity associations are promoted by management to avoid the formation of trade unions
 or to rival existing labor unions. There are credible reports that, at times, demo-
 cratic principles are not adhered to in the formation and management of some of
 these associations, and workers are unable to participate fully and freely in deci-
 sionmaking. Similar credible charges are made against some trade union organiza-
 tions.
 At the request of trade union leaders, the independent Human Rights Ombuds-
 man, through his Office for Economic and Social Issues, receives complaints related
 to trade union activities. Union leaders and workers filed a number of complaints
 with the Ombudsman during the year, but no results were apparent by year's end.
 In June members of the ILO Committee on the Application of Conventions noted
 the serious situation of violence and insecurity that exists in Guatemala, including
 murders and abductions "with the participation of the army and death squads," as
 well as the "difficult transition towards democracy" under way in the country and
 asked for "total and unconditional respect" by the new Government to their observa-
 tions.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Workers have the right to or-
 ganize and argain collectively but are often denied this right by antiunion actions
 of employers. The practice of collective bargaining is limited, moreover, by the weak
 structure of the union movement, the lack of experience with this practice, and by
 the preference of management in many cases to avoid formal ties with trade unions.
 While some well-written collective contracts are honored by both management and
 the unions, other contracts were openly ignored and violated by both parties. Most
 workers, even those organized by trade unions, do not have collective contracts to
 cover their wages and working conditions. Wages received by the bulk of the work
 force tend to be the minimum wages established by a bipartite commission, which
 operates under the guidance of the Ministry of Labor.
 Workers cannot be dismissed for participating in the formation of a trade union;
 complaints in this regard must be filed with the labor inspectors for resolution. The
 Labor Code provides for the right of employers to fire workers for cause and permits
 workers to appeal their dismissal to the labor courts but does not require the rein-
 statement of any worker fired without cause. The revised Code prohibits employers
 from firing workers for union organizing and protects them for 60 days following
 the officia publication of approval of the union. It also prohibits employers from fir-
 ing any member of the executive committee of a union and protects them for an ad-
 ditional 12 months after they are no longer on the executive committee. If a member
 is fired for cause, this can only be made effective after a trial and a court resolution
 has been issued.
 Labor courts responsible for enforcing labor laws continued generally to be ineffec-
 tive. Efforts to restructure and modernize the labor court system made no headway.
 A heavy backlog of labor cases continued to clog the courts.
 The scarcity of labor inspectors, the lack of adequate training and resources, and
 structural weaknesses in the labor court system resulted in only minimal enforce-
 ment of the Labor Code. The Ministry of Labor hired 37 new labor inspectors in
 mid-September and provided them with training and resources to carry out their
 functions. Some were assigned to rural areas to give greater attention to the lack
 of protection of worker rights for rural workers. In the second half of the year, the
 Ministry of Labor significantly stepped up its inspections and the number of cases
 it filed in the courts for failure to comply with the labor law.
 Labor laws and regulations apply throughout the country, including in the few ex-
 port processing zon, P (EPZ's). The laws governing EPZ's are not discriminatory on
 the subject of organizing trade unions or collective bargaining. While union leaders
 often blame employer pressures and unofficial restricted access to the EPZ's for
 their virtual inability to organize workers in these zones, labor conditions in these
 zones are no different from those found outside the zones.
 Workers and trade union leaders charge that all workers, including those in
 EPZ's, receive low wages, work long hours without legally required overtime pay,
 and toil under poor working conditions. While Labor Ministry inspectors filed nu-
 merous complaints before the labor courts on these charges, few of these cases were
 resolved due to inefficiencies within the court system, corruption and political chica-
 nery, and legal maneuvering to prolong the hearing process.
 
 
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Constitution bars forced or
 compulsory labor, and the practice does not exist. Human rights and indigenous
 groups continue to charge that coerced participation, particularly of indigenous peo-
 ples, in the PAC's violates prohibitions against forced labor. There were credible re-
 ports of isolated instances of unpaid PAC members being used to provide free man-
 ual labor, but no systematic pattern of such practice was established.
 d. Minimum Age for the Employment of Children.-Although the Constitution
 bars employment of minors under the age of 14, children below this age are regu-
 larly employed in the formal and informal sectors of the economy. Laws governing
 the employment of minors are not effectively enforced, due to the shortage of quali-
 fied labor inspetrs and structural weaknesses in the labor court system. Only
 5,000 minors have legal permission from the Labor Ministry to work. Thousands
 working without legal permission are open to exploitation, generally receiving no so-
 cial benefits, no social insurance, no pension or vacations, and no severance pay and
 are paid below the minimum wage level. The Labor Ministry has a program to edu-
 cate minors, their parents, and employers on the rights of minors in the labor mar-
 ket. Economic necessity, however, forces most families to have their children seek
 some type of employment to supplement the family income.
 The Constitution provides for compulsory education for all children up to the age
 of 12 or to the sixth grade. The statistics on illiteracy, however, clearly demonstrate
 this law is not enforced. The national illiteracy r is is 52 percent, with rural areas
 showing a rate of 85 percent. The bulk of those who cannot read or write are
 women, particularly inigenous women. Child labor is largely confined to small or
 family-type enterprises, to agricultural work, and to the informal sectors of the econ-
 omy. There are no export industries in which child Lbor is a significant factor.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-Minimum wages are set by law. Due to a vari-
 ety of factors, most importantly the oversupply of labor and the limited demand for
 it, the minimum wage for most unskilled and semiskilled workers is the prevailing
 wage ceiling and not the more commonly accepted wage floor. Widespread, credible
 reports indicated the minimum wage is commonly, if illegally, not paid to significant
 numbers of rural and urban workers.
 The minimum wage was last increased in late 1991, when it was raised by 78.5
 percent. The minimum wage for commercial and industrial workers is $2.42 (14
 quetzals) for an 8-hour workday, including a required hourly bonus. The minimum
 wage for farm workers is $2.00 (11.60 quetzals) per day, including a mandatory
 bonus. This minimum wage does not provide a decent standard ofliving;, govern-
 ment statistics indicate that it should be at least three times higher than the cur-
 rent level. An estimated 80 percent of the population lives below the Guatemalan
 poverty line, including approximately 70 percent of those employed. A bilateral com-
 mittee representing labor and management is named each year to make rec-
 ommendations for increases in the minimum wage. In the event that agreement is
 not possible, the Government may decree such increases.
 The legal workday is 8 hours and the workweek is 44 hours, but a tradition of
 much longer hours remains in place due to economic conditions. The amended Labor
 Code continues to require a weekly rest period of at least 24 hours. Trade union
 leaders and human rights groups charge that workers are commonly forced to work
 overtime, often without premium pay, or given drugs to help them work longer in
 order to meet work requirements. Labor inspectors report that numerous instances
 were uncovered of such abuses, but corruption and inefficiencies in the labor court
 system inhibit adequate enforcement of the law.
 Occupational health and safety standards are inadequate. As with other aspects
 of the labor law, enforcement of standards that do exist is also generally inadequate.
 Workers have the legal right to remove themselves from dangerous workplace situa-
 tions, and the law provides them with protection for their continued employment.
 However, few workers are willing to jeopardize their jobs by complaining about un-
 safe working conditions. Training courses for labor inspectors in health and safety
 standards were provided, but this area is not perceived as a high priority for the
 resource-poor ministry. Legislation requiring companies with more than 50 employ-
 ees to provide on-site medical facilities for their workers is not effectively enforced,
 even though many large employers do provide such facilities.
