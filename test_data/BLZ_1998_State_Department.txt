 BELIZE
 Belize is a parliamentary democracy with a constitution enacted in 1981 upon
 independence from the United Kingdom. The Prime Minister, a cabinet of ministers,
 and a legislative assembly govern the country. The Governor General represents
 Queen Elizabeth II in the largely ceremonial role of head of state. The Government
 
 
 502
 changed hands in August when Prime Minister Said Musa's People's United Party
 (PUP) won 26 of 29 seats in the House of Representatives in free and fair elections.
 The Government generally respects the constitutional provisions for an independent
 judiciary.
 The Police Department has primary responsibility for law enforcement and main-
 tenance of order. The Belize Defense Force (BDF) is responsible for external security
 but when deemed appropriate by civilian authorities may be tasked to assist the go-
 lice department. Both the police and the BDF report to the Minister of National e-
 curity and are responsible to and controlled by civilian authorities. There were occa-
 sional reports of abuse by the police.
 The economy is primarily agricultural, although tourism has become the principal
 source of foreign exchange earnings. The agricultural sector is heavily dependent on
 preferential access to export markets for sugar and for bananas. The Government
 favors free enterprise and generally encourages investment, although domestic in-
 vestors are given preferential treatment over foreign investors in a number of key
 economic sectors. Preliminary estimates put 1998 gross domestic product growth at
 3.5 to 4.5 percent in real terms. Annual per capita income was about $2,690.
 The Constitution provides for, and citizens enjoy in practice, a wide range of fun-
 damental rights and freedoms. Principal human rights abuses include occasional use
 of excessive force by the police when making arrests, poor prison conditions, allega-
 tions of arbitrary arrest and detention, lengthy pretrial detention, political influence
 on the judiciary, judicial limits on freedom of the press, discrimination and violence
 against women, some abuse of children, and employer mistreatment of iminigrant
 workers in the banana industry.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political or
 other extrajudicial killings.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution forbids torture or other inhuman punishment. However, the police
 occasionally used excessive force when making arrests. In February a police officer
 with a history of violent behavior fired what he termed a warning shot that killed
 a Salvadoran man. The authorities brought manslaughter charges against the police
 officer, but he was immediately released on bail and awaits trial. In May a detainee
 accused police of torture and abuse in an effort to obtain a false confession (see Sec-
 tion 1.d.). The Police Department, the Police Complaints Board, and on occasion spe-
 cial independent commissions appointed by the Prime Minister investigate allega-
 tions of abuse by officials.
 Prison conditions are poor. Conditions at the Hattieville Department of Correc-
 tions-the nation's only prison-have deteriorated steadily since it opened in 1993.
 Although designed to house 500 inmates, it now houses approximately 1,100 or
 about 6 prisone-.s per 10-by-12-foot cell. The majority of prison accommodations do
 not have showers or toilets. Instead, inmates are provided with 5-gallon buckets.
 One physician's assistant-a newly established position-provides medical services
 for inmates. The prison includes a separate facility for women; however, the admin-
 istrative section of the prison is situated nearby and as a result, guards and male
 prisoners occasionally roam about this area. There is no separate facility for inmates
 with mental illnesses. Approximately 20 percent of the inmates are non-Belizeans.
 There are rare reports of human rights abuses at the prison, in the form of physical
 brutality by prison wardens. Incidents of gang and drug related violence in the pris-
 on are increasing.
 The Government took steps-to curb recidivism and focus on rehabilitation. For ex-
 ample, the expanding Youth Enhancement Academy houses 2,130 youth between
 the ages of 13 and 25, who participate in rehabilitation and job training programs.
 However, some youthful offenders are still housed in the main prison with adult
 prisoners. A job training program at a citrus farm employs approximatel 50 in-
 mates. In addition, for the first time in the country's history, parole is available for
 inmates who partially serve their sentences, demonstrate good behavior, and abide
 by certain conditions.
 The Government permits prison visits by independent human rights monitors.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution prohibits arbitrary ar-
 rest or detention, and the Government generally observes these prohibitions. How-
 ever, although accusations of arbitrary arrest and detention are rare, there were se-
 rious allegations of such practices in May when police arrested and detained 30 in-
 dividuals, 14 of whom were registered refugees. Police arrested these detainees dur-
 
 
 ing a search for suspects in a large-scale robbery on the Hummingbird highway out-
 side Belmopan. The authorities held some beyond the 72-hour limit without access
 to legal assistance; they released others after the maximum holding period but im-
 mediately detained them again. The police did not charge the detainees with a crime
 and eventually released them. The police claimed to have picked up the 30 people
 as part of an ongoing investigation into previous crimes. One detainee accused police
 of torture and abuse in order to attempt to comp el him to confess falsely. Later, the
 police arrested three men and charged them withï¿½ the robbery.
 The law requires the police to inform a detainee of the cause of detention within
 48 hours of arrest and to bring the person before a court to be formally charged
 within 72 hours. In practice, the authorities normally inform detainees immediately
 of the charges against them. Bal is granted in all but the most serious cases. In
 cases involving narcotics, the police cannot grant bal, but a magistrate's court may
 do so after a full hearing. Many detainees cannot afford bail, however, and backlogs
 in the judicial system often cause considerable delays and postponements of hear-
 ings, resulting in an overcrowded prison and at times prolonged incarceration before
 trial.
 The Constitution forbids exile, and it does not occur.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution provides for an independent judi-
 ciary, and the Government generally respects this provision in practice. However,
 the appearance of judicial independence from the executive branch is also com-
 promised because some non-Belizean judges and the Director of Public Prosecutions
 must negotiate renewal of their employment contracts with the Government and
 thus may be vulnerable to political interference.
 The Government appointed two Belizean judges and promoted a current judge to
 Chief Justice. With these appointments, the Supreme Cor was composed of four
 Belize an judges (with tenure to age 62) and one Caribbean judge on a renewable
 2-year contract. The new Chief Justice had been named the day before the elections,
 and when the PUP came into power, it asked for his resignation. The judge refused,
 and the issue had not been resolved by year's end.
 The judiciary consists of the magistrate's courts, the Supreme Court, the Court
 of Appeal, and a family court that determines cases of child abuse, domestic vio-
 lence, and child support. Those convicted by either a magistrate's court or the Su-
 preme Court may appeal to the Court of A ppeal. In some cases, including those re-
 sulting in a capital sentence, the convicted party may make a final appeal to the
 Privy Council in the United Kingdom.
 Persons accused of civil or criminal offenses have constitutional rights to pre-
 sumption of innocence, protection against self-incrimination, defense by counsel, a
 public trial, and appeal. Legal counsel for indigent defendants is provided by the
 State only for capital offenses. Trial by jury is mandatory in capital cases.
 Trials in cases that come before the family court generally are private. The con-
 victed p arty in family court also may appeal to the Supreme Court. Defendants have
 the right to be present at their trial unless the other party fears for his or her safe-
 ty. In such a case, the court grants interim prvisions under which both parties are
 addressed individually during a 5-day period.
 There are lengthy trial backlogs in the judicial system. One factor commonly cited
 is the low pay offered to judges, resulting in a high turnover rate. In addition, an
 inordinate number of significant narcotics-related cases are taking years to resolve.
 In these cases, defendants are often released on minimal bail payments. A foreign
 judge helped reduce a large backlog of civil cases.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution prohibits such practices, government authorities generally respect
 these prohibitions, and violations are subject to legal sanctions. However, there were
 several cases in which the previous Government expropriated private land, osten-
 sibly for public use. The law requires that the Government pay compensation in
 such instances, but these cases take years to settle.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech
 and of the press but also permits the authorities to make "reasonable provisions"
 in the interests of defense, public safety, public order, public morality, or public
 health. These provisions include forbidding any citizen to question the validity of
 the financial disclosure statements submitted by public officials. Anyone who ques-
 tions these statements orally or in writing outside a rigidly prescribed procedure is
 subject to a fine of up to $5,000 or imprisonment of up to 3 years, or both.
 A wide range of viewpoints is publicly presented usually without government in-
 terference in seven privately owned weekly newspapers, four of which are directly
 
 
 504
 affiliated with major political parties. There is no daily press. All newspapers are
 subject to the constraints of libel laws.
 In a notable exception to freedom of the press, the Minister of Broadcasting
 threatened to discontinue the license of one radio station, claiming that it was in
 violation of the public morality provision of the Constitution. Media reports sug-
 gested that the threat was politically motivated, because the owner of the station
 was a member of the opposition party.
 Since the first privately owned commercial radio station began broadcasting in
 1990, other stations have been established, broadening the audience's choices. In ad-
 dition to these local stations, there are two British military stations that broadcast
 news direct from London. Popular radio call-in programs are lively and feature open
 criticism of and comments on government and political matters.
 In November the new PUP Government ceased operation of the government-fi-
 nanced Broadcasting Corporation of Belize (BCB) and its two radio stations. The
 previous government had utilized BCB studios and facilities to produce partisan ad-
 vertisements and party propaganda. BCB once held a monopoly on radio in the
 country and provided news and weather reports in areas where no other radio sig-
 nal was received. With BCB's closure, the Government sold its frequencies to two
 private radio stations, which should ensure continuity in broadcasts that cover the
 entire country.
 There are eight privately owned television broadcasting stations, including several
 cable networks in Belize City and the major towns. The Government's Belize Infor-
 mation Service and two independent television stations produce local news and fea-
 ture programs. The Belize Broadcasting Authority (BBA) regulates broadcasting and
 asserts its right to preview certain broadcasts, such as those with political content,
 and to delete any defamatory or personally libelous material from political broad-
 casts. As far as is known, the BBA did not exercise this authority during the year
 although there appeared to be ample opportunity to do so during the aggressive and
 negative media campaigns each party waged.
 The law provides for academic freedom, and the Government respects it in prac-
 tice.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 freedom of assembly and the authorities honor it in practice. Political parties and
 other groups with political objectives freely hold rallies and mass meetings. The or-
 ganizers of public meetings must obtain a permit 36 hours in advance of the meet-
 ings; such permits are not denied for political reasons and are routinely granted in
 practice.
 The Constitution permits citizens to form and join associations of their choice,
 both political and nonpolitical.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the
 Government respects this right in practice.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Constitution provides for these rights, and the Government re-
 spects them in practice.
 The Government generally cooperates with the United Nations High Commis-
 sioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and other humanitarian organizations in assisting ref-
 ugees. In 1997 the UNHCR downgraded its mission to a liaison office (by December
 staffed with a single volunteer) and ceased all funding for the Government's Refugee
 Department, which had previously relied upon the UNHCR to pay all program costs,
 including salaries. As a result, the Government's refugee program was greatly re-
 duced.
 A government committee to review applications for asylum meets weekly and in-
 cludes a UNHCR representative as a member. The Government turned down 31 re-
 quests for asylum in 1998. The Government honors the principle of first asylum and
 most recently provided it to four persons in 1995.
 In the wake of the civil conflicts in Central America during the 1980's, over
 40,000 mostly Hispanic immigrants came to Belize, many of them entering illegally
 and living in the country without documentation. The Government has granted asy-
 lum and allowed local resettlement of about 8,000 refugees. In a move criticized by
 the UNHCR, the Government adopted an unwritten policy requiring refugees to live
 in Belize for 10 years before they can apply for citizenship. By contrast, nonrefugee
 residents must only live in the country for 5 years before being eligible to apply.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Belize is a democracy governed by a National Assembly, with executive direction
 from a cabinet of ministers headed by Prime Minister Said Musa. The law requires
 national elections at least every 5 years.
 
 
 505
 All elections are by secret ballot, and suffrage is universal for citizens 18 years
 and older. National political parties include the People's United Party, the United
 Democratic Party (UDP), the National Alliance for Belizean Rights (NABR), and the
 People's Democratic Party (PDP). The nation's ethnic diversity is reflected in each
 party's membership. The Government changed hands (for the fourth time since inde-
 pendence in 1981) in August when the PUP won 26 of 29 seats in the House of Rep-
 resentatives.
 No laws impede participation of women in politics; their scarcity in electoral poli-
 tics can be attributed to tradition and socioeconomic factors. Only two members of
 the House of Representatives are women. However, women hold a number of ap-
 pointive offices, including four of nine Senate seats. In addition, both the president
 of the Senate and the Speaker of the House are women.
 There are no laws impeding participation by indigenous people or minority groups
 in politics. There are Garifuna, Maya, Creole, and Mestizo representatives at the
 national level.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 A number of human rights groups operate without government restriction, inves-
 tigating and publishing their findings on human rights cases. Government officials
 are generally cooperative and responsive to their activities. The Human Rights Com-
 mission of Belize (HRCB), a nongovernmental organization (NGO) affiliated with re-
 gional human rights organizations and partly funded by the UNHCR, operates free
 of government restriction on a wide range of issues, including refugee and agricul-
 tural workers' rights, cases of alleged police abuse, and cases of alleged illegal de-
 portations of Central American nationals. The HRCB publicizes human rights com-
 plaints and urges police and other government bodies to act upon them. The HRCB
 gained prominence through media reports about its workshops and seminars that
 educate citizens about human rights.
 Local and international human rights groups operate freely, and the Government
 cooperates with independent investigations of human rights conditions.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 Belize is a multiracial, multiethnic country, and the Government actively pro-
 motes tolerance and cross-cultural understanding. Discrimination on ethnic or reli-
 gious grounds is illegal and rare, although ethnic tension, particularly resentment
 of recently arrived Central American and Asian immigrants, continued to be a prob-
 lem. The Government continues to reserve certain professions for Belizean nation-
 als, granting permits and licenses to non-Belizeans only in specific cases. These oc-
 cupations include fishing, souvenir manufacturing, sightseeing tours, accounting, in-
 surance, real estate, and legal services.
 Women.-Violence against women is a chronic problem. A shelter for battered
 women offers short-term housing, and a hotline provides information on options for
 women who are victims of violence. The Belize Organization for Women and Devel-
 opment, a private voluntary organization, advises women on their rights and pro-
 vides counseling. Laws prohibit rape and sexual harassment, but few offenders are
 charged and convicted. There is no law specifically prohibiting spousal rape.
 There were reports of trafficking in women for purposes of prostitution. One or
 more dance hall owners have recruited women from neighboring countries, promis-
 ing them jobs as dancers, waitresses, or domestics. When they arrive in the country,
 usually illegally, the employer takes their passports, forces them to engage in pros-
 titution and holds their wages. The police have investigated, but have not made any
 arrests, nor has the Government has not taken any other steps to deal with this
 problem.
 Despite constitutional provisions for equality, women face social and economic
 prejudices. For example, women find it more difficult than men to obtain business
 and agricultural financing and other resources. Most employed women are con-
 centrated in female-dominated occupations with traditionally low status and wages.
 A women's bureau in the Ministry of Human Development, Women, and Youth is
 charged with developing programs to improve the status of women. A number of of-
 ficially registered women's groups work closely with various government ministries
 in promoting social awareness programs. Women have access to education and are
 active in all spheres of national life, but relatively few are found in top managerial
 positions. While the law mandates that women receive equal pay for equal work,
 female wage earners often earn less than men in similar jobs. There are no legal
 impediments to women owning or managing land or other real property.
 
 
 506
 Children.-Education is compulsory for children between the ages of 5 and 14.
 After children finish their primary education, they may enter a secondary school,
 the government-run apprenticeship program, or a vocational institution. However,
 these programs have room for only about one-half of the children finishing primary
 school; competition for spaces in secondary school is intense. Education is nominally
 free, but various school, book, and uniform fees put education out of reach for many
 poor children. There is a family services division in the Ministry of Human Develop-
 ment, Women, and Youth devoted primarily to children's issues. The division coordi-
 nates programs for children who are victims of domestic violence, advocates rem-
 edies in specific cases before the family court, conducts public education campaigns,
 and works with NGO's and the United Nations Children's Fund to promote chil-
 dren's welfare. There is also a national committee for families and children, which
 includes a representative from the Ministry of Human Development, Women, and
 Youth.
 Incest, child molestation, and child abuse are believed to be widespread among
 some ethnic groups. The passage of the Families and Children Act in August allows
 the authorities to legally remove a child from an abusive home environment. This
 act also revised many previous laws that affected the rights of children. The act re-
 moves the limit placed on the amount of child support a parent must pay and also
 allows men to file for child support-as well as women. It requires parents to main-
 tain and support a child until he or she reaches the age of 18, compared with the
 previous law's removal of such support after age 16. The new act also accepts DNA
 testing as legal proof of paternity and maternity. It requires that all adoptions be
 reported to the human development department and that prospective parents be
 screened before they may adopt a child.
 People With Disabilities.-The law does not specifically provide for accessibility for
 disabled persons nor prohibit job discrimination against them. The Government's
 Disability Services Unit, as well as a number of NGO's such as the Belize Associa-
 tion of and for Persons with Disabilities and the Belize Center for the Visually Im-
 paired, provide assistance to physically disabled persons. Disabled children have ac-
 cess to government special education facilities, although the requirements to enter
 these programs are strict.
 Indigenous People.-There are a number of indigenous people loosely grouped
 under the general term Maya. The Maya have sought official recognition of their
 communal claims to land, but the Government has been reluctant to single out one
 ethnic group for special consideration. The Maya reservations are not demarcated
 on official maps, and the Maya have filed suit to force the Government to accord
 recognition to their reservations.
 The Maya have formed cultural councils and other groups to advance their inter-
 ests, sometimes with the collaboration of NGO's concerned with environmental and
 indigenous issues. One Mayan council sued the Government to rescind a logging
 concession on traditional Mayan lands granted to a foreign company. The council
 also sought and won greater involvement by the Mayan community in an inter-
 nationally funded highway project in the southern part of the country, the location
 of many Mayan communities.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-By statute and in practice, workers are free to estab-
 lish and join trade unions. Eleven independent unions, with approximately 11 per-
 cent of the labor force, represent a cross-section of white-collar, blue-collar, and pro-
 fessional workers, including most civil service employees. Several of these unions,
 however, are inactive. The Ministry of Industry, Commerce, Public Services, and
 Labor recognizes unions after they fie with the registrar's office. The law empowers
 members to draft the by-laws and constitutions of their unions, and they are free
 to elect officers from among the membership at large. Unions that choose not to hold
 elections may act as representatives for their membership, but the national Trade
 Union Congress permits only unions that hold free and annual elections of officers
 to join its ranks. Both law and precedent effectively protect unions against dissolu-
 tion or suspension by administrative authority.
 The law permits unions to strike. In December the Government repealed a 1994
 law that required unions representing essential government services to give 21 days'
 notice to the ministry concerned before they could strike. In practical terms, this
 law had prohibited strikes by employees in revenue-collecting departments.
 I Although no unions are officially affiliated with political parties, several are sym-
 pathetic to one or the other of the two main parties (the UDP and the PUP). Unions
 freely exercise the right to form federations and confederations and affiliate with
 international organizations.
 
 
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The law provides for collec-
 tive bargaining and unions freely practice it throughout the country. Employers and
 unions set wages in free negotiations, or, more commonly, employers simply estab-
 lish them. The Labor Commissioner or his representative acts as a conciliator in
 deadlocked collective bargaining negotiations between labor and management, offer-
 ing nonbinding counsel to both sides. Historically, the Commissioner's guidance has
 been voluntarily accepted. However, should either union or management choose not
 to accept the Commissioner's decision, both are entitled to a legal hearing of the
 case, provided that it is linked to some provision of civil or criminal law.
 The Constitution prohibits antiunion discrimination both before and after a union
 is registered. Unions may freely organize, but the law does not require employers
 to recognize a union as a barg  g agent. For example, although the registered
 Banana Workers Union actively advocated worker rights, it was not recognized by
 the banana industrys growers association due to low membershp. Some employers
 have been known to block union organization by terminating the employment of key
 union sympathizers, usually on grunds purportedly unrelated to union activities.
 Effective redress is extremely difficult in such situations. Technically, a worker may
 file a complaint with the Labor Department, but in practice it was virtually impos-
 sible to prove that a termination was due to union activity.
 The Labor Code applies in the country's two export processing zones (EPZ's).
 There are no unions in the EPZ's, however, reflecting the general weakness of orga-
 nized labor in the country.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Constitution and laws forbid
 forced, compulsory, or bonded labor, and it is not generally known to occur.
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment.-Laws pro-
 hibit forced and bonded labor by children, and the Government effectively enforces
 this prohibition. The minimum age for employment is 14 years, or 17 years for em-
 ployment near hazardous machinery. Inspectors from the Departments of Labor and
 Education enforce this regulation, although in recent years school truancy officers,
 who have historically borne the brunt of the enforcement burden, have been less ac-
 tive. The law requires children between the ages of 5 and 14 to attend school, but
 there are many truants and dropouts.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The minimum  wage is $1.12 (BZ$2.25), except
 in export industries where it is $1.00 (BZ$2.00) per hour. For domestic workers and
 shop assistants in stores where liquor is not consumed, the rate is $0.87 (BZ$l75)
 per hour. The minimum wage law does not cover workers paid on a piecework basis.
 The Ministry of Industry, Commerce, Public Services, and Labor is charged with en-
 forcing the legal minimum wage, which is generally respected in practice. The mini-
 mum wage as a sole source of income does not provide a decent standard of living
 for a worker and family. Most salaried workers receive more than the minimum
 wage.
 The law sets the nal ora  orkweek at no more than 6 days or 45 hours. It re-
 quires payment for overtime work, 13 public holidays, an annual vacation of 2
 weeks, and sick leave for up to 16 days. An employee is eligible for severance pay
 provided that he or she was continuously employed for at least 5 years. A patchwork
 of health and safety regulations covers numerous industries, and the Ministry of
 Labor and the Ministry of Industry, Commerce, Public Services, and Labor enforce
 these regulations to varying degrees. Enforcement is not universal, and the min-
 istries commit their limited inspection and investigative resources principally to
 urban and more accessible rural areas where labor, health, and safety complaints
 have been registered. Workers have the legal right to remove themselves from a
 dangerous workplace situation without jeopardy to continued employmenti
 The exploitation of undocumented Hispanic workers, particularly young service
 workers and possibly some agricultural workers, continued to be an issue for the
 Government, the HRCB, and other concerned citizens. Banana farm owners are
 slowly moving the housing they provide for their workers away from the fields
 where poisonous pesticides are sprayed. Health clinics in the region report that the
 most frequently treated ailments are pesticide-related skin conditions. Company-
 provided housing often lacks electricity and water.
