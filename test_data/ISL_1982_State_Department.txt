 ICELAND
 Iceland is a democratic social welfare state with the oldest
 elected parliament in the world, the Althing, which first met
 in 930. Democratic traditions and ideals are deeply rooted,
 and there is broad legal and social support for human rights.
 Elections to the Althing are held at least every four years,
 and the President of the Republic is popularly elected every
 four years as well. In the presidential election of 1980,
 Iceland elected the first woman chief of state chosen by direct
 popular election anywhere in the world. This was further
 evidence that Icelanders support the equality of women and
 their ability to participate fully in the nation's public
 affairs. In the 1982 municipal elections, women demonstrated
 real power as a separate political force when four candidates
 from new feminist parties were elected to city councils in
 Reykjavik and Akureyri.
 Internationally, Iceland is a strong defender of individual
 human rights. During 1982, the State Lutheran Church and the
 Icelandic Federation of Labor launched the most successful fund
 raising appeal in Iceland's history for the relief of the
 Polish people, and a small but symbolic number of Polish
 refugees (26) were accepted for resettlement in Iceland.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom froms
 a. Killing
 In modern times there have been no killings in Iceland for
 political motives.
 b. Disappearance
 -There have been no allegations of people disappearing because
 of official or quasi-official actions. Secret arrests,
 clandestine detention, and quasi-official security forces are
 unknown in Iceland.
 c. Torture
 Freedom from torture is guaranteed by law and respected in
 practice. There have been no allegations of torture in Iceland.
 d. Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 Freedom from cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or
 punishment is guaranteed by law and respected in practice.
 Physical punishment is not practiced. Prisons and jails are
 .modern-and clean; health care and diet are excellent. All
 prisoners are treated the same, except that those convicted of
 serious crimes are subjected to somewhat stricter security
 precautions. There is no discrimination by social class, race,
 sex, or religion. *There are virtually no restrictions on
 family or attorney visits. There have been no executions in
 Iceland in modern history.
 e. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 Freedom from arbitrary arrest or imprisonment is guaranteed by
 law and respected in practice. There is habeas corpus; anyone
 detained must be brought before a judge within 24 hours and
 
 
 933
 charged or released. There is no preventive detention, and
 there are no political prisoners.
 f. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Fair public trial is guaranteed. The courts are under the
 Minister of Justice for administrative purposes, but are
 independent of political control, and there are no military or
 other special courts. Defendants are entitled to legal counsel
 and the state will pay the fees if the defendant cannot.
 Defendants may appeal to the Supreme Court. In practice this
 often results in sentences being modified in the defendant's
 favor.
 g.  Invasion of the Home
 Freedom from invasion of the home is guaranteed by law and
 respected in practice. Judicial warrants are required except
 in cases of hot pursuit. There have been no allegations of
 illegal entry or other violations of the home.
 2. Respect for Civil and Political Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and the Press
 These freedoms are guaranteed by law and are in effect.
 Printed materials are not censored except for restrictions on
 some hard-core pornography. Films are normally distributed
 without restriction, but scenes that are considered to have
 extreme violence and sexual perversion may be deleted. The
 Government makes no attempt to restrict journalistic or
 academic inquiry. With the help of financial backing from
 political parties, Iceland has a large number of newspapers for
 its small population. They are entirely free of government
 control. In fact, newspapers are subsidized equally by the
 Government, which is required by law to place its
 advertisements in all of Iceland's five national daily papers.
 Limits on criticism of the Government and the political parties
 by the press are unknown. Radio and television broadcasting
 are state-owned and operated; their journalists are supposed to
 be non-partisan and to maintain standards of professional
 ethics. They are supervised by public boards representing the
 four major political parties, as well as other interests.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 There are no restrictions on public meetings except general
 regulations for public safety for outdoor meetings. Unions,
 scientific bodies, and professional associations operate freely.
 Civil and political liberties in Iceland are fully respected.
 The labor movement, a dominant social and political force
 within the country, acts to protect the rights of all workers,
 a policy backed by advanced and comprehensive public welfare
 legislation. Democratic processes exist at all levels,
 assuring the freedom to participate in the political process.
 The issue of democracy within the unions occasionally surfaces
 in Icelandic political debate. Allegations are heard that
 small cliques perpetuate themselves in power, safe from
 effective challenge, but these allegations are normally used
 for partisan purposes. Icelandic unions are highly
 politicized, with all of the major parties, ranging from the
 leftist People's Alliance to the conservative Independence
 Party, in leadership positions. No solid evidence has ever
 
 
 934
 surfaced to suggest that the democratic processes within the
 unions cannot be fully utilized by any group that chooses to do
 so.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 The Lutheran Church is established in the Constitution and is
 the nominal faith of the vast majority of Icelanders. Other
 faiths practice freely and without restriction. Religion is
 not a factor in civil, economic, or political status.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 There is freedom of movement, foreign travel, and emigration.
 The only practical obstacle to foreign travel is a limit on the
 amount of money travelers (other than students and emigrants)
 may take abroad. Many people find this an inconvenience, but
 it does not seriously impede.their business or vacation travel.
 There are no restrictions on voluntary repatriation. There are
 no refugees from Iceland, and forcible repatriation is
 unknown. Icelanders may emigrate freely, with no
 discrimination or harassment. There is no discrimination
 against women or other groups in such matters.
 In modern history, Iceland has received three groups of
 refugees. Following the Hungarian revolt of 1956, fifty
 Hungarian refugees settled in Iceland. A few of these
 eventually moved on for their own reasons, but the majority
 stayed and are completely integrated into Icelandic society.
 In 1979, Iceland accepted thirty-four Vietnamese refugees.
 They were received and settled with great care, including
 comprehensive health care, vocational and language training,
 and public housing. Many of the Vietnamese are now working and
 attending school. Iceland has undertaken to accept twenty
 additional Vietnamese refugees, mainly relatives of those in
 the first group. In 1982, Iceland accepted 26 Polish refugees
 for resettlement in Iceland. Six refugees subsequently
 returned to Poland expressing "dissatisfaction with the Western
 system." The remaining refugees are said to be adjusting well.
 e. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 There are four major political parties and several minor ones
 which compete in national and local elections. The parties
 operate freely and democratically both in their internal
 workings and in electoral competition. By law, national
 elections are held every four years, though they may be called
 more frequently if a Government chooses to resign. The
 national Government and most local governments consist of
 coalitions of two or more of the parties, and it is not unusual
 for completely different constellations of parties to form
 succeeding governments.
 Women are legally equal to men. They may participate freely in
 social, economic, and political life. Women tend to remain in
 traditional roles, however. They comprise approximately 40
 percent of the work force and are active in every aspect of
 Icelandic political, economic, and cultural life. As noted
 above, the President of Iceland is a woman. In the May 1982
 national municipal electionsi groups of women organized in the
 capital city of Reykjavik and the major northern city of
 Akureyri to present lists of candidates. In each city, two
 women were elected to the councils; in Akureyri, where the
 
 
 935
 feminist slate held the balance of power in forming a coalition
 government, the feminist first-seat candidate was elected
 Council President. The long established Women's Rights
 Association held a conference in 1982 to discuss strengthening
 the participation of women in town and district political
 institutions.
 Political, professional, economic, and public interest groups
 of all kinds exist and are encouraged by the Government. Many
 of these advocate issues or philosophies which may be in
 opposition to a particular Government or political party.
 There are a few extremist groups on the political fringes.
 They are small, non-violent and tolerated by the public and the
 Government. There are no significant problems regarding
 nationality, citizenship, or statelessness.
 3. Government Attitude and Record Regarding International
 and Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged
 Violations of Human Rights
 Iceland is signatory of both the International Covenant on
 Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on
 Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights. Iceland has permanent
 representation on the European Human Rights Commission of the
 Council of Europe and a judge on the European Human Rights
 Court. No requests have been made for outside investigation of
 the human rights situation in Iceland. There are several human
 rights organizations active in Iceland including Amnesty
 International and groups monitoring compliance with the
 Helsinki Final Act and dissident activities in the Soviet Union
 and Eastern Europe. These groups focus almost all their
 attention and resources on problems in foreign countries.
 The State Lutheran Church has taken a leadership role on human
 rights issues, in addition to raising money for the Polish
 people. In September 1982 the Bishop of Iceland was asked by
 the four political parties to address a vigil for the victims
 of the massacre in Beirut. A special committee emphasizing
 human rights on El Salvador was established in the spring of
 1982, but it has not been active. There is some effort to
 improve further the participation by disadvantaged groups, such
 as the mentally and physically handicapped, in Iceland's social
 welfare programs. There are also feminist organizations which
 work for women's rights and particularly for greater
 participation by women in the political process and economic
 and social organizations. These groups are encouraged and
 supported by the Government and the political parties.
 4. Economic, Social, and Cultural Situation
 National policy stresses full employment and provision of
 decent social services, education, and housing. Education
 through the university level is free. There are extensive
 programs to encourage private ownership of homes and to provide
 a comprehensive system of medical and dental care, as well as
 necessary social services, for the entire population. A social
 welfare state on the Scandinavian pattern, Iceland has
 comprehensive programs of old age and disability pensions,
 unemployment compensation, sickness insurance, and child and
 family care. Infant mortality is only 9.67 per 1000 births.
 Economic, health, and social standards are among the best in
 the world, on a par with the Scandinavian countries and the
 middle class in the United States, with life expectancy at
 birth of 73.0 years for males and 79.2 years for females.
 There is virtually no poverty, illiteracy, or unemployment.
 The per capita income is approximately $8,400.
