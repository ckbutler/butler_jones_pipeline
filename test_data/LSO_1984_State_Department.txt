 LESOTHO
 Lesotho is nominally a constitutional monarchy but, in fact,
 almost all political power is held by Prime Minister Leabua
 Jonathan and his ruling Basotho National Party. In 1970,
 Jonathan suspended the Constitution, which provided for
 parliamentary democracy, and declared the results of that
 year's elections null and void. Seats in the present National
 Assembly are all appointed, with a heavy majority going to
 Basotho National Party members, who also currently hold all
 cabinet portfolios. The Government asserts that traditional
 democratic practices are preserved through the holding of mass
 public meetings known as "pitsos," but dissent is rarely aired
 at these government-orchestrated gatherings. The Government
 also emphasizes respect for the chieftancy system,
 hierarchically extending from village chiefs to district
 chiefs to the king, although this system plays a marginal role
 in the national decision making process. The main function of
 the "pitsos" and the chieftancy system is to elicit public
 support for decisions already made by Jonathan's Government.
 A sporadic armed insurgency waged since 1978 by supporters of
 Basotholand Congress Party leader Ntsu Makhehle abated in
 1984, with only one attack reported. The insurgents, known as
 the Lesotho Liberation Army, have in the past been held
 responsible for attacks on government and/or ruling party
 installations and personnel including cabinet ministers. The
 Government does not believe, however, that the insurgents have
 permanently abandoned their campaign of violence and continues
 to cite the threat of renewed attacks as justification for the
 strengthening of security laws.
 The Human Rights Act of 1983, technically guaranteeing many
 fundamental human rights, came into force in July 1984.
 However, this Act is 'subject to the provisions of existing
 law," which includes temporary detention without trial and
 other restrictions on human rights. The Parliament passed a
 new internal security bill in 1984, which codifies existing
 security laws, removes bail in cases of armed robbery,
 increases sentences for certain security offenses, and allows
 for the detention of witnesses in security cases. While the
 courts have not hesitated to rule against the Government in
 security cases, potential for mistreatment of prisoners prior
 to trial remains high, as it is also for those detained for
 purely criminal offenses.
 Lesotho is a developing country which has a free market
 economy based primarily on subsistence agriculture. The
 economy is highly dependent on remittances by Lesotho citizens
 engaged in migrant labor in South Africa, amounting to 40
 percent of Lesotho's gross national product. The Government
 is likewise dependent on revenue generated by the South
 African Customs Union, which accounts for 70 percent of
 government revenue. The economic situation worsened in 1984
 primarily due to a major drought which plagued most of
 southern Africa.

 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section I Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 Although acts of violence attributed to the Lesotho Liberation
 Army decreased markedly in 1984, a small number of deaths
 undoubtedly occurred. One person died while apparently
 constructing bombs.
 Individuals with political opposition and/or suspected
 insurgent ties have been attacked by persons alleged to be
 members of the police, the army, or local police volunteer
 units. One prominent opposition supporter was shot at by
 unknown assailants outside his house in July 1984. Two
 separate armed attacks in late 1984 on shops owned by two
 brothers identified with the opposition resulted in the death
 of one of the men and his son and the wounding of the other.
 One of the dead men had been acquitted on treason charges
 earlier in the year. A magistrate's inquest into the 1983
 death of Henry Masheane, who allegedly hung himself while in
 security detention in 1983, was completed with the finding
 that Masheane had been killed while in detention, although no
 one was held responsible.
 b. Disappearance
 No disappearances were reported in 1984.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Beatings by police and military personnel continue to be
 reported, although they are difficult to document. Such abuse
 generally takes place during the arrest and interrogation
 phases, and it is apparently not limited to cases related to
 national security but extends to common criminals as well.
 Conditions in places of detention are extremely poor. Given
 the constraints on government spending, any improvement in
 detention facilities appears unlikely. Prisoners who can
 afford lawyers (and are thus more likely to file lawsuits
 charging abuses) usually receive better treatment.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Habeas corpus applies to ordinary arrests and few prisoners
 are held outside legal norms. Habeas corpus does not apply to
 those detained under the Internal Security (General) Act of
 1982. This act provides for preventive detention under an
 interim custody order of an initial period of 14 days, after
 which a detention order must be issued or the individual
 released. The detention order is valid for 14 days and may be
 extended an additional 14 days, after which the detainee must
 be charged or released. If released, the individual may be
 redetained only for a different cause.
 The initial 14-day detention may be effected by any policeman;
 the second period of 14 days can be ordered only by the
 Commissioner of Police. The third period must be ordered by a
 Minister. During the initial 14 days, access to the detainee
 requires police permission; during the second stage,
 
 
 175
 LESOTHO
 ministerially appointed "advisers' are permitted access.
 Advisers so far appointed have been district coordinators,
 magistrates, or government medical officers, all employees of
 the State. The function of the "advisers" is to report on the
 health of the detainee, to investigate whether a detainee has
 been involved in subversive activities, and to advise the
 Minister on the need for the continued detention. Since they
 do not have access to attorneys, individuals under preventive
 detention may make representations on their treatment only
 through the "advisers." The Internal Security (General) Bill
 of 1984 revokes bail in cases of armed robbery and allows for
 detention of witnesses in security cases.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The judiciary in Lesotho is independent and has acted to limit
 police or military infringements of law and procedure on a
 number of occasions. Court decisions and rulings are
 respected and obeyed by the authorities. Civil suits alleging
 maltreatment are accepted and adjudicated. Verdicts of civil
 courts may be appealed to the high court. In military cases,
 decisions may be appealed to officers of higher rank,
 including to the Lesotho Paramilitary Force Commander, but not
 to civilian courts. Under the system of Roman-Dutch law
 applied in Lesotho, there is no trial by jury.
 Eleven men allegedly associated with the Lesotho Liberation
 Army were tried on charges of high treason before the High
 Court in early 1984. The defendants were accused of
 involvement in a series of sabotage incidents. The Chief
 Justice, who presided, dismissed the case for lack of evidence
 without the defense having to present its case. A number of
 witnesses for the prosecution failed to appear, while others
 testified that their evidence was obtained under duress. The
 case of the lone female defendant was dismissed before going
 to trial.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 These rights are generally respected in Lesotho, although
 under the Internal Security Act of 1982 the police are given
 wide powers to stop and search, and to enter homes or other
 places for a similar purpose without warrant. Forced entry of
 the home has in the past been credibly alleged but is quite
 possibly the result of indiscipline rather than deliberate
 policy. The leader of one small opposition party reported
 that his home and offices were searched by the police, who
 confiscated some of his records and a tape of an interview he
 had made with South African radio.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Internal Security Act of 1982 does not contain safeguards
 of free speech. In practice, opposition viewpoints are freely
 expressed only in two Sesotho-language weekly newspapers
 published by the Roman Catholic and Evangelical Churches. In
 1984, criticism centered on the lack of elections, the
 Government's format for proposed elections, Lesotho's
 recognition of the People's Republic of China, and the
 establishment of diplomatic relations with several eastern
 bloc countries, including the Soviet Union. This criticism
 
 
 176
 LESOTHO
 has been tolerated but has been rebutted and attacked by
 government-owned Radio Lesotho (the only radio station in
 Lesotho) and in the government-published Lesotho Weekly. The
 Government has also strongly criticized articles and
 viewpoints in the South African media, which are widely read
 and listened to in Lesotho.
 As talk of elections increased in 1984, Radio Lesotho sharply
 stepped up its attacks on opposition parties and politicians,
 depicting them variously as irrelevant splinter groups with no
 support, opportunistic political has-beens, or agents of South
 Africa. One dissident member of the ruling party apparently
 applied for air time but was turned down. With the
 government-controlled radio serving as the voice for the
 ruling party, opposition viewpoints have as their only outlets
 the two church weeklies, or the South African media.
 Thabo Lesehe, the Assistant Editor of the Lesotho Evangelical
 Church paper, was detained for several weeks in early 1984 and
 subsequently released without charge. The Roman Catholic
 newspaper was censured by the Parliamentary Privileges
 Committee for allegedly misrepresenting remarks made in a
 speech by the Minister of Justice and Prisons, although the
 Committee seems to have no legal standing to enforce such a
 condemnation.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Permits are required for public and private meetings. Groups
 wishing to hold political rallies or organized sessions
 sometimes encounter harassment, generally in the form of
 denial or delays of permit applications, or of investigatory
 arrests of persons attending. Members of the police can
 generally be expected to attend such meetings. Despite these
 restrictions, numerous rallies were held in 1984 by the
 opposition parties.
 Although freedom of association is generally respected in the
 trade union sphere, the Government intervened to encourage the
 formation of a single trade union confederation after
 negotiations for the merger of the two existing confederations
 broke down. The Government declared the registrations of both
 confederations null and void, and as a result most of the
 member unions of the two met and approved the formation of a
 new combined confederation, the Lesotho Congress of Free Trade
 Unions (LCFTU). Some trade unions associated with the former
 Lesotho Federation of Trade Unions have criticized the new
 confederation, alleging that some union leaders who joined the
 new confederation did so without the approval of their
 membership.
 All trade unions in Lesotho enjoy the right to organize,
 bargain collectively, and strike. However, trade unionism has
 played a relatively minor role in the society, largely because
 of the small size of the modern manufacturing, retail, and
 service sectors.
 Union, government, and employer representatives have
 participated in delegations to the International Labor
 Organization and other foreign and international trade union
 organizations, and there are a number of programs and projects
 sponsored by these groups designed to strengthen trade
 unionism in Lesotho. The LCFTU is a member of the
 democratic-oriented, Brussels-based International
 
 
 177
 LESOTHO
 Confederation of Free Trade Unions, as well as of the
 Organization of African Trade Union Unity.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 These is no state religion in Lesotho. Free and open
 religious practice is permitted. Christianity is the dominant
 faith, with the principal denomination being Roman
 Catholicism. There is a significant Protestant minority
 composed of the Lesotho Evangelical Chruch (Presbyterian),
 Anglican Church, and a wide variety of other denominations.
 Conversion is permitted, and there is no indication that
 members of a given religion are persecuted or discriminated
 against on that basis or gain any advantage over another.
 Although some of the Government's principal opponents have
 belonged to the Lesotho Evangelical Church, many government
 officials are likewise active in that faith. A number of
 churches are engaged in a dialogue with the Government and
 exiled opposition political leaders with the aim of promoting
 anational reconciliation" with exiled opponents of the regime.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Movement within the country is free, although temporary police
 and military roadblocks are sometimes set up to counter
 insurgent activity. There is no legal restraint on
 emigration, but overseas travel is made more difficult by a
 sizable repatriation deposit required of passport applicants.
 Large numbers of Lesotho citizens perform migrant labor,
 taking advantage of employment available in the mining and
 other sectors of the South African economy. Several thousand
 political refugees and economic migrants from South Africa
 reside in Lesotho. They are generally free to move about the
 country, although the Government imposes restrictions on the
 political activities of refugees as a condition of their
 entry. Government policy is to integrate South African
 refugees, insofar as possible, into the mainstream of Lesotho
 society. A small number of South African refugees left
 Lesotho for other neighboring countries in late 1983,
 reportedly to avoid possible reprisal from South Africa.
 Although Lesotho is a signatory of the U.N. Protocol Relating
 to the Status of Refugees, refugees who leave Lesotho on U.N.
 travel documents issued by Lesotho are sometimes not granted
 the right to return.
 While a number of political exiles from Lesotho are resident
 in neighboring countries, notably Botswana and South Africa,
 repatriation is not discouraged. The 1980 Amnesty Act allows
 political exiles to return after signing statements concerning
 ,any criminal acts they may have committed, but few have done
 so. Internal opposition leaders have called for the
 Government to assure the safe return of political exiles in
 conjunction with any future elections. Prime Minister
 Jonathan has publicly stated that he would favorably consider
 an amnesty application, if made, by Ntsu Mokhehle, the exiled
 leader of the Lesotho Liberation Army.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Prime Minister Jonathan and the leadership of his Basotho
 National Party have ruled Lesotho since they were freely
 
 
 178
 LESOTHO
 elected by a narrow margin in 1965, manipulating the system to
 remain in power. In 1970, when the results of the first (and
 so far only) post-independence elections appeared to be going
 against him, Jonathan declared a state of emergency, suspended
 the constitution, and voided the election results.
 Subsequently, an "interim" Parliament was appointed, with the
 vast majority of seats going to the Basotho National Party and
 a handful to the Basutoland Congress Party and the Marematlou
 Freedom Party.
 Contrary to the Government's promise, the 1984 session of the
 interim Parliament adjourned without a date being set for
 elections. The interim Parliament did pass three electoral
 amendment acts which, inter alia, call for staggered voting,
 a significantly larger deposit for each parliamentary
 candidate, and more voter signatures on a petition required
 for each candidate to be placed on the ballot. The opposition
 parties charged that these new measures could be used to
 intimidate voters and discourage opposition candidates from
 running.
 The lack of elections has made it difficult to estimate the
 level of popular support accorded to any of the parties.
 Several opposition parties have announced their intention to
 contest elections when they are eventually held. The exiled
 leader of the military wing of the Basutoland Congress Party,
 Ntsu Mokhehle, has apparently rejected the elections proposed
 by the Government as unfair and refuses to take part. Other
 members of the Basutoland Congress Party who have eschewed
 violence operate openly in Lesotho, as do the other opposition
 parties, but the public activities of all are somewhat
 restricted by security legislation. The newly formed Basotho
 Democratic Alliance, which registered as a political party
 after several opposition politicians had discussions with the
 South African Foreign Minister, has been criticized by the
 Government because of its alleged South African ties. Two of
 its leaders who held seats were expelled from Parliament.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 In past years, representatives of Amnesty International who
 have visited Lesotho to investigate human rights conditions
 have met with government officials and been provided access to
 some security detainees who complained of abusive treatment.
 In general, the Government has attributed alleged human rights
 violations to an excess of zeal or indiscipline by low-level
 police or military officials, not sanctioned by government
 policy, and pointed to the judicial remedies available in the
 courts. In its 1984 report, Amnesty International was
 concerned about the use of detention without trial and the
 failure to investigate allegations of torture of detainees.
 Members of Amnesty International reportedly wrote to Lesotho
 government officials in 1984 concerning the status of several
 security detainees, but it is not known what reply they may
 have received. Freedom House rates Lesotho "partly free."
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 Lesotho is one of the countries designated by the United
 Nations as "least developed," with a per capita gross national
 product of $512 in 1982. Over 40 percent of this amount was
 made up from remittances from immigrant workers in the
 
 
 179
 LESOTHO
 Republic of South Africa. About 90 percent of the country's
 imports and tourist traffic comes from South Africa. In
 addition, Lesotho is tied to South Africa through a customs
 union and an interchangeable currency. Customs union receipts
 in recent years have averaged about 70 percent of total
 government revenues. These funds, coupled with donor support
 programs, have managed to prop up a shaky and apparently
 unstable fiscal program, at the price of South African
 domination of Lesotho's agricultural sector. In addition, the
 potential of well-paying jobs, by Lesotho standards, has
 attracted the cream of the labor force to South Africa at the
 expense of local development. Only about 10 percent of the
 indigenous Lesotho labor force is employed outside traditional
 agriculture.
 Lesotho's economic plight is further complicated by its
 general lack of natural resources, its mountainous terrain,
 and its generally low rainfall. Development of water
 resources, including potential hydropower, appears the best
 long-range hope for economic development.
 The 1984 population was estimated to be 1,474,000, with an
 annual growth rate of 2.5 percent. Life expectancy was
 estimated to be 53.77 years in 1984. The infant mortality
 rate was 99.4 per 1,000 live births in 1984, down from 104.3.
 Nutritional standards are adequate, with the ratio of calorie
 supply available for consumption to nutritional requirements
 estimated in 1977 to be 98.46 percent. However, a reduction
 in food supplies due to the current drought has hit some areas
 hard, with reports of serious malnutrition among children in
 certain villages. In 1975, only 17 percent of the population
 was estimated to have access to safe water. Major efforts by
 both the Government and donors since then have greatly
 increased this percentage, although exact figures are not
 available.
 Lesotho has a long history of church-sponsored primary schools
 located throughout the country, which have contributed to a
 comparatively high adult literacy rate. School enrollment in
 1979 was 118.34 percent overall--96.2 percent for boys and
 140.8 percent for girls.  (Refugees from South Africa account
 for this increased ratio beyond 100 percent.) Although a
 basic church-sponsored education system is in place, both the
 Government and the churches lack the funds to standardize
 training, improve standards, and replace and develop needed
 facilities. Generally, the education provided is highly
 academic and provides little or no vocational training.
 All Basotho have fairly equal opportunity within the confines
 imposed by political reality, although in the areas of
 property and contracts married women's rights, independent of
 their husbands, are limited by custom and law. For example,
 married women cannot apply for loans without their husband's
 written consent. Women in Basotho society have traditionally
 been a stabilizing force, due to the absence of hundreds of
 thousands of men working in South Africa. Fuller use of their
 talents and abilities will depend on the progress Lesotho
 makes in providing education, health, and other social
 services to the rural areas where the overwhelming majority of
 those women live.
