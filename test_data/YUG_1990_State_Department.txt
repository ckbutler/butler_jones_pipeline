 YUGOSLAVIA
 The Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia is
 constitutionally established as a multiethnic, federal state
 comprising six republics (one of which has two autonomous
 provinces). The decentralized system set up by President Tito
 in the Federal Constitution of 1974 delegated much power to
 republic and local authorities in order to preserve stability
 among Yugoslavia's contentious ethnic groups.
 State security and uniformed police are under the jurisdiction
 of Federal and Republic Secretariats for Internal Affairs.
 The armed forces are under federal jurisdiction.
 The former economic system of worker self-management, a type
 of decentralized socialism, is being phased out. The Federal
 Government made progress in its major program of economic
 reform, intended to open the economy to market forces by
 reducing government regulation, reforming the banking system,
 expanding competition by making enterprises more independent,
 and encouraging private enterprise and foreign investment.
 Nearly 85 percent of agricultural land is privately owned, and
 there has been a rapid increase in the number of private
 enterprises in the service sector and in small export-import
 businesses.
 In 1990 multiparty elections took place in each of Yugoslavia's
 republics. International observers judged that these elections
 were generally correct, the most notable exception being the
 blatant bias of official media in Serbia in favor of the ruling
 party. The elections resulted in the formation of non-
 Communist governments in Croatia, Slovenia, and Bosnia-
 Hercegovina, electoral victories by Communist or successor
 parties in Montenegro and Serbia, and victory in Macedonia by
 a group of non-Communist and Communist parties.
 In most of the country, there were significant advances in
 human rights. In the province of Kosovo, Serbian authorities
 continued and intensified repressive measures that featured in
 1990 thousands of political arrests, tens of thousands of
 politically motivated job dismissals, and widespread police
 violence against ethnic Albanians. This violence included the
 use of excessive force by the police to disperse peaceful
 demonstrators, including random and- at times unprovoked
 shooting by police, resulting in at least 30 deaths and
 hundreds of injured.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 There were no reported instances of such killings.
 b. Disappearance
 No instances of disappearance were reported.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Yugoslav law forbids torture. There were credible reports,
 however, that people were sometimes beaten, mistreated, or
 threatened during detention. The problem was particularly
 
 
 1343
 YUGOSLAVIA
 severe in Kosovo. For example, in August an American citizen
 was arrested in Kosovo for allegedly participating in a
 demonstration during a visit by U.S. Senators. The American,
 who denied the charges against him, was severely beaten by
 Serbian police during his interrogation. He also suffered
 other forms of mistreatment, such as deprivation of food and
 water.
 There were also eyewitness accounts of ethnic Albanian
 prisoners being severely beaten by Serbian police. One
 prisoner had a cigarette lighter held to his fingers to revive
 him after he had been beaten unconscious. Many other Albanians
 suffered similar mistreatment at the hands of the Serbian
 police. The practice of making new prisoners in jail "run the
 gauntlet" through a line of baton-wielding police who beat
 them was widespread.
 There were also reports of brutality by prison guards. Such
 brutality toward ethnic Albanians was alleged in the trial of
 prison guards in Leskovac and Vranje, two prisons in Serbia
 proper to which ethnic Albanians had been moved following the
 unrest in Kosovo during the winter of 1989. The Leskovac
 prison doctor, who was not a defendant, testified that he had
 examined patients to see how much more beating they could
 withstand. Three of the 11 Leskovac defendants were convicted
 and received the lightest possible sentence (3 months in jail).
 Some members of international human rights groups believe that
 witnesses in the Leskovac case were intimidated by police and
 civilians to keep them from testifying. In the Vranje trial,
 which began in 1989 and ended in 1990, 4 of the 12 defendants
 were found guilty and were given the same light sentences.
 In January six Serbian prisoners in Nis staged a hunger strike
 because of the beating of a fellow prisoner. In a magazine
 interview in September, one of the strikers reported that
 conditions had improved in the prison since the strike.
 The "Anatoliy Koryagin Committee" of the Movement for the
 Protection of Human Rights, which deals with the political
 abuse of psychiatry, reported 24 documented cases of
 incarceration in psychiatric hospitals for political reasons,
 of which 5 to 6 were new in 1990. In May the Social-
 Democratic Alliance of Serbia protested the forced psychiatric
 testing and medication of a member of their group's
 presidency, Dragan Stefanovski. The group claimed that
 Stefanovski was being persecuted by this and other means for
 his independent union activities during a Decemher 1989 strike.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Yugoslav criminal law and legal procedures include many
 provisions considered by observers to be inconsistent with
 internationally accepted human rights. The law allows
 investigatory detention for up to 3 months, with a possible
 3-month extension, which is often implemented. Azem Vlasi, a
 former president of the League of Communists of Kosovo, spent
 7 months in detention until his trial began in October 1989
 and 6 more months until his acquittal in April 1990. Access
 to prisoners in pretrial detention by family or legal counsel
 is sometimes restricted, ostensibly to prevent interference
 with investigations.
 Arbitrary arrest occurred most frequently in Kosovo, where
 ethnic Albanians were routinely and summarily sentenced to 30
 to 60 days in jail, often on misdemeanor charges of
 
 
 1344
 YUGOSLAVIA
 "disturbing public order" on the basis of an unsupported
 statement by a single policeman. Thousands of Albanians in
 Kosovo were arrested and imprisoned in this manner. Albanian
 activists believe that at least 5,000 people had been arrested
 for participating in demonstrations in 1990. Under judicial
 procedures pertaining to misdemeanors, a prisoner may appeal a
 conviction only after sentencing, and, because of the time
 required to file the appeal, the sentence is often completed
 before the appeal can be heard. Because of the speed of the
 trial and sentencing, defendants often cannot obtain legal
 assistance, although they have the legal right to an attorney.
 Albanian political activists are routinely called in for
 lengthy-arbitrary questioning by police, often late at night.
 For example, the dean of the Pristina medical faculty, Dr.
 Alush Gasi, was taken in for extensive questioning in
 September following his meeting with U.S. Senators.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 There is a Yugoslav federal criminal code, and each republic
 and province also has its, own criminal code and court system.
 In the past, all ofthese codes and court systems were roughly
 similar, but changes in 1990 to the federal criminal code and
 current or impending changes in the codes of several republics
 could well lead to significant differences. Only decisions by
 the highest republic and provincial courts, their supreme
 courts, may be appealed to the Federal Supreme Court. The
 Federal Constitutional Court rules on the constitutionality of
 laws and regulations, but its rulings must be enforced by the
 republic authorities, which at times simply choose to ignore
 them. Offenses by those in the armed forces or offenses by
 civilians deemed to affect national security are tried in the
 military court system. In September the Federal Government
 announced that military and civilian defendants in military
 court cases would Se permitted to engage civilian lawyers of
 their choice.
 Defendants have the right to be present at their trials and to
 have an attorney, at public 'xpense if needed. The legal
 system, however, still contains numerous inequities unfavorable
 to the defendant, regardless of whether the trial is criminal
 or political. The defense is sometimes restricted in the time
 allowed to prepare its case. While the prosecution may call
 as witnesses whomever it wishes, the defendaht may only request
 the court to call witnesses, and the court has complete
 discretion as to whether or not to honor the'request.
 Prosecutors are allowed to appeal a verdict of not guilty.
 Court records of trials are not verbatim records of testimony.
 Instead, they are judges' summaries, dictated periodically
 during the trial. This limits the record to what the judge
 considers the important points and may omit vital evidence
 needed should the case be appealed. Few lawyers contest the
 judge's summarization, although, in the Vlasi trial, lawyers
 routinely challenged the summarizations, often successfully.
 Some trials are audiotaped and the tapes transcribed, but the
 court usually refuses to do this in political cases. In the
 past, judges were required to meet "moral-political" criteria,
 which in practice meant they had to be members, or at least
 acceptable to, the League of Communists. Legal cases at all
 levels have been susceptible to manipulation by the political
 authorities, which in some cases simply predetermined verdicts.
 
 
 1345
 
 YUGOSLAVIA
 During 1990, there were major changes in the federal and
 republic legal systems. Several republics adopted or debated
 new constitutions that sought to guarantee an independent
 judiciary. Serbia, for example, adopted a new constitution
 that in principle guarantees defendants the right to legal
 counsel of their own choice in all legal proceedings. The
 independence of the judiciary is also stipulated. Despite
 these-changes, there remains strong opposition to the
 introduction of a genuinely independent judiciary. Many old
 judges are being retained, and in Serbia judges reportedly
 were being pressured to join the ruling SocialistParty of
 Serbia, the successor to the League of Communists of Serbia.
 The judicial system is also accused of ethnic bias, usually in
 favor of the dominant group in a particular region. Ethnic
 Albanians in Macedonia charge that courts there are often
 biased against them. Serbian officials claim that ethnic
 Albanian judges in Kosovo were too lenient with fellow
 Albanians in the past. As an example, an August 8 article by
 the official press agency Tanjug reported that judges in the
 Kosovo town of Podujevo did not prosecute 1,500 traffic
 offenses by Albanians, which had occurred over the course of 4
 months. In 1990, after the Serbian takeover of Kosovo,
 however, any semblance of an independent judiciary disappeared
 there. Most ethnic Albanian judicial officials and judges
 were replaced by ethnic Serbs, and thousands of Albanians were
 sentenced on a variety of trumped up criminal charges.
 Changes made in the federal criminal code by the Federal
 Assembly in June narrowed the definitions of statutes
 regarding political crime. Article 114, which prohibited
 "counterrevolutionary activity," was limited to a prohibition
 against using force or threats of force to overthrow the
 constitutional order or its executive organs. Article 133,
 which prohibited "hostile propaganda," was similarly limited
 to propaganda that advocated violence. However, the potential
 for political abuse remains, including through articles such
 as Article 134 ("spreading racial, national, or religious
 hatred") and Article 116 ("endangering territorial integrity").
 Article 116 has been used to prosecute those who advocate
 republic status for the province of Kosovo. Use of these
 federal articles is declining in most parts of the country.
 In Croatia and Slovenia, there were no prosecutions under
 these articles. The Croatian constitution adopted in 1990
 .provides no basis for such laws but bans political parties
 that threaten Croatia's territorial integrity. A revised
 Serbian law made insulting federal or republic officials
 punishable by up to 3 years' imprisonment.
 It is difficult to establish the number of political prisoners
 in Yugoslavia, given the changing situation, the significant
 differences between various parts of the country, and the
 distinction between offenses under the criminal code and
 misdemeanors. Since the victory in democratic elections in
 the spring of 1990 of non-Communist governments in the
 republics of Croatia and Slovenia, no persons have been
 convicted there of political offenses .under the criminal
 code. Altogether, however, thousands of persons were
 sentenced in Yugoslavia in 1990 for political offenses, the
 vast majority of these being ethnic Albanians sentenced on
 misdemeanor charges in Kosovo.
 There were several amnesties of political prisoners in 1990.
 - In April the Federal Presidency granted amnesty to 108
 political prisoners and reduced the sentences of 116 of the
 
 
 1346
 YUGOSLAVIA
 remaining 190. One of those released was ethnic Albanian
 activist Adem Demaqi' who had served a total of 29 years in
 prison. Of the 190 political prisoners still in jail at that
 time, 160 were ethnic Albanians. The 74 who did not have
 their sentences reduced are persons who also had convictions
 for ordinary nonpolitical offenses in addition to the
 political ones. In Croatia in July, the newly elected
 government granted amnesty to all 37 political prisoners and
 reduced the sentences of about 2,500 other nonpolitical
 prisoners. The annual Republic Day amnesty in November freed
 564 people, of whom 525 were released as a result of changes
 in the federal criminal code in June.
 Yugoslav law permits the arrest and imprisonment of Yugoslav
 citizens for acts considered criminal offenses under Yugoslav
 law, even when they are committed abroad and are not crimes in
 the country in which they take place. Such cases are often
 based on the expression of views "hostile" to the Yugoslav
 Government or association with perceived anti-Yugoslav
 groups. There were no known cases prosecuted under these laws
 in 1990. "Damaging the interests of Yugoslavia abroad" is
 still a crime in Yugoslavia, although its definition has been
 further legally restricted.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Arbitrary interference in private life occurs most often in
 connection with government efforts to monitor opposition or
 dissident activity. Although the judicial system includes
 restrictions on arbitrary searches, these safeguards were
 widely ignored in the past and still are in parts of
 Yugoslavia, particularly in Serbia and its provinces.
 Authorities eavesdropped on conversations, read private mail,
 and tapped telephones in some cases. Yugoslav citizens are
 generally free to receive and read foreign publications.
 Yugoslav law stipulates that police may enter a home without a
 warrant only to collect evidence on a specific crime or, in
 exceptional cases, to prevent a crime in progress. In Kosovo,
 however, police routinely searched homes without warrants,
 ostensibly searching for weapons. After a general strike on
 September 3, for example, Serbian police in Kosovo searched
 homes and confiscated hard currency and other valuables. In
 Pristina in the early fall, police ransacked the home of Roman
 Catholic Bishop Nike Prelja without a warrant. Earlier in
 August, police had searched two Roman Catholic churches in
 Kosovo and confiscated medicines which they said had been used
 to produce phony symptoms of illness among Albanian
 schoolchildren.
 During a period of unrest in Serb-populated areas of Croatia
 in October, there were reports that Croatian police entered
 the private homes of Serbs without warrants.
 g. Use of Excessive Force and Violations of Humanitarian
 Law in Internal Cdnflicts.
 The Serbian campaign to reassert control over the
 predominantly ethnic Albanian province of Kosovo led to large
 Albanian demonstrations which the Serbian police broke up by
 using repressive measures, including lethal gunfire. A
 peaceful demonstration of 20,000 Albanians ifn Pristina on
 January 24 was dispersed by the police using tear gas and
 water cannons. Several days of demonstrations followed in
 
 
 1347
 
 YUGOSLAVIA
 which protesters threw rocks at the police, set fire to
 vehicles, and damaged property, and the police used deadly
 force trying to disperse them. Serbian authorities allege
 that some demonstrators fired shots at the police. Albanian
 opposition groups credibly reported that the police engaged in
 numerous instances of random or unprovoked violence. On
 January 30, an armored vehicle and two militia cars drove
 through the town of Malisevo, randomly shooting at passersby.
 and killing three persons, although there were no disturbances
 in Malisevo at the time. Similar attacks also occurred in the
 villages of Banja and Ostrozub. Between January 24 and
 February 3, the Federal Secretariat for Internal Affairs
 announced that 30 people were killed and 110 injured, of whom
 44 were policemen. Kosovo activists released a list of 36
 Albanian demonstrdtors killed. The investigation of police
 actions, conducted by the police themselves, proved to be a
 whitewash.
 In August a peaceful crowd of about 10,000 ethnic Albanians,
 who had gathered in Pristina to welcome a delegation of
 visiting U.S. Senators, was dispersed by the police using tear
 gas, water cannon, and clubs., The crowd had already begun to
 disperse of its own accord when it was charged by the police,
 according to observers. Some demonstrators threw stones at
 the police. Serbian police'reported that 46 Albanians and 21
 policemen were injured.
 In September police killed four persons during a house-to-house
 search for illegal weapons near the Kosovo town of Podujevo.
 Police claimed that ethnic Albanians forcibly resisted the
 confiscation of their weapons. Albanian activists, however,
 deny this and report that the police acted with unprovoked and
 unnecessary brutality.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Yugoslav law provides for freedom of speech and press in
 principle. Although the general trend in Yugoslavia is toward
 greater freedom of speech and press, most media organs remain
 heavily influenced by the leaderships of the respective
 republics. In Serbia proper and its provinces of Kosovo and
 Vojvodina, restrictions on freedom of speech and press are
 especially severe.  Any expression-of views that Serbian
 officials characterize as Albanian nationalism, including the
 peaceful call for Kosovo to be made a republic within the
 borders of present-day Yugoslavia, is anathema. Shouting
 "Kosovo republic" or holding up two fingers in a "V for
 victory" sign may result in arrest for "disturbing public
 peace and order."
 In December the Federal Assembly adopted a new press law
 guaranteeing freedom of information, eliminating the
 subordination of the press to the Socialist Alliance of
 Working People (SAWP), and allowing up to 49 percent of
 foreign ownership. The law also contains provisions
 forbidding editors from opposing the country's constitutional
 order or national security interests.
 Authorities control most broadcasting and print media in Serbia
 and seek to suppress or punish written or oral expression
 perceived as unfriendly to the ruling party. For example,
 
 
 1348
 YUGOSLAVIA
 after Belgrade Television aired biased news coverage of their
 June 13 rally, opposition parties picketed the studios. In
 October authorities in Vojvodina replaced about 20 journalists
 with persons more acceptable to the ruling party, and in
 December three more Novi Sad journalists lost their jobs for
 supposed insubordination. At Politika, 34 journalists signed
 a petition protesting their newspaper's coverage; 40 from
 Politika and 23 from the weekly Nin, who refused to write as
 they were ordered, were demoted and had their pay cut.
 Following the Serbian takeover of Kosovo in July (see Section
 3), almost all Albanian-language media were completely
 suppressed. All local Albanian-language radio and television
 news btoadcasts were halted, and the largest Albanian-language
 paper, Rilindja, was closed down. Hundreds of journalists in
 Kosovo were suspended from their jobs for striking in
 opposition to the Serbian takeover. In September Rilindja
 journalist Zenun Celjaj, who is also secretary of the
 Committee for the Defense of Human Rights in Kosovo, was
 arrested for participating in an underground meeting of
 Albanian members of the suspended Kosovo People's Assembly,
 which proclaimed a new constitution for Kosovo.
 In September police detained a Yugoslav and an American
 correspondent for Western news agencies while they were
 covering the general strike in Kosovo. Police threatened them
 with beatings and expulsion and then released them.
 Although under the influence of republic leaderships, the
 media in other republics generally enjoy greater independence
 than those in Serbia. After democratic elections in Slovenia,
 the media functioned with almost complete independence,
 although efforts by the new government to take control of some
 parts of the media still continued. In Croatia, the
 television and radio are under the formal control of the
 parliament which in the spring transferred some senior media
 officials in an effort allegedly to reduce the influence of
 editors appointed by the previous Communist government. In
 October a local official in Split tried to force out editors
 of the Split daily Slobodna Dalmacija, known for its
 independent views, on the spurious grounds that the paper
 supported "unitarist" and "Greater Serbian" policies.
 Croatian reporters were attacked by Serbs while reporting on
 ethnic disputes in Serb-populated areas of Croatia. In
 Macedonia and Bosnia, opposition parties complained that the
 official media discriminate against them. In Montenegro,
 Titograd radio director Danilo Burzan received anonymous
 threats after airing a program in June featuring Serbian
 opposition leaders who were denied access to Belgrade radio.
 On the positive side, Channel 3 in Belgrade regularly
 broadcasts Western news and controversial domestic talk
 shows. A commercial television began operating in Zagreb in
 July, and an independent television station is operating in
 Split. A private Sarajevo firm has received permission to
 begin broadcasting on radio and television.
 Public prosecutors have the power to ban temporarily the
 publication and sale of books or periodicals if they deem the
 content is "false" or could "disturb" the public. A judge
 must review the temporary ban, and editors may contest the
 prosecutor's decision at the hearing. Serbian writer Dobrica
 Cosic was charged with "making statements tipsetting to the
 public" in an interview with the Italian publication Il Tempo.
 The indictment was thrown out in April for insufficient
 
 
 1349
 YUGOSLAVIA
 evidence. The June 1 issue of the Serbian opposition
 publication, Srpska Rec, was temporarily banned and 30,000
 copies confiscated. The ban was overturned about a week
 later, but the prosecutor appealed, and the Supreme Court of
 Serbia upheld the ban in September.. Outside of Serbia
 (including Kosovo), the banning of publications is now
 becoming rare.
 Despite such developments in Serbia, the trend in most of
 Yugoslavia is toward greater publishing freedom. The first
 legal, privately owned political paper in postwar Yugoslavia,
 Samouprava (Self-management), was launched in February in
 Vojvodina. Also in Vojvodina, the first private paper in the
 Hungarian language, Naplo, was founded in May. In Belgrade,
 an independent, privately owned newsweekly, Vreme, began
 publishing in October. Many new Yugoslav opposition parties
 began publishing their own papers or magazines in 1990.
 Previously banned works, such as Milovan Djilas' "The New
 Class" and "The Unperfect Society" and the works of other
 Yugoslavs, were published in 1990. The book "Documents on the
 Foreign Policy of Yugoslavia 1941-1945" was heralded by
 Yugoslav academics and diplomats as a breakthrough in
 nonideological historical publication.
 Controversy over academic freedom in Serbia arose in March when
 Dr. Drago Roksandic, a history instructor at the University of
 Belgrade, was denied a teaching position because of his
 political beliefs. (He later found a position elsewhere in
 Yugoslavia.> In Kosovo, at least 90 ethnic Albanian
 university professors who opposed Serbia-'s takeover of
 provincial government organs were fired. Almost all of the
 ethnic Albanian staff at the Pristina Medical Faculty--76
 instructors--were fired. Many professors at Pristina
 University who refused t& sign a loyalty oath to the republic
 of Serbia were dismissed. In December about 100 Albanian
 public schoolteachers in Podojevo were fired for refusing to
 use a new curriculum imposed by Serbia.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Freedom of assembly varies widely. The Federal Constitution
 guarantees freedom of assembly, but this right has
 traditionally been severely circumscribed in practice. All
 public gatherings must be registered with the authorities, who
 often ban those that appear to oppose official policies. In
 Kosovo practically any gathering of ethnic Albanians is likely
 to be broken up on the pretext that it is "separatist" or
 "hostile" to the policies of the Serbian government. Many
 demonstrations in Kosovo ended in mass arrests, sometimes
 accompanied by violence.
 Ethnic Albanians were also arrested for demonstrations outside
 Kosovo. In Macedonia, 107 participants in a February 1
 demonstration were detained in Tetovo, an Albanian-populated
 town. Claiming that "outside agitators" from Kosovo were
 responsible for organizing the demonstration, the Macedonian
 police arrested at least 20 persons, and they were sentenced
 to up to 60 days' imprisonment. In Sibenik, Croatia, local
 police prevented a demonstration by 100 Albanians on February
 27 and took some of them into custody for "failing to register
 their stay in Sibenik." The police in Bosnia-Hercegovina
 banned a meeting of the Croatian Democratic Union in Ljubuski
 in July, claiming it violated the republic's law against
 national-based parties. The law was changed later that
 
 
 1350
 
 YUGOSLAVIA
 month. In Zagreb in December, a banned public meeting by a  -
 legally registered party, the Croatian Party of Right, took
 place without hindrance.
 In June after Serbian opposition parties organized a
 demonstration of some 50,000 people calling for free elections
 in the republic, police without provocation attacked some
 demonstrators protesting the biased editorial policies of
 Belgrade Television. Several opposition leaders were slightly
 injured. In August Serbian police broke up a Macedonian
 national celebration near the monastery of Prohor Pcinski on
 the Serbian-Macedonian border and allegedly beat some
 Macedonians with nightsticks.
 Freedom of association expanded significantly in 1990. The
 republics passed laws or changed their constitutions to allow
 multiple political parties. The League of Communists of
 Yugoslavia (LCY) remains the only political party permitted by
 the 1974 Federal Constitution, but, in fact, the LCY and the
 SAWP have ceased to function effectively at the federal level
 even though the LCY or its successor parties remain strong in
 some republics, particularly in Serbia and Montenegro. In a
 June reform of the federal criminal code, Article 131
 ("antistate activity in cooperation with foreign
 organizations") was abolished. In addition, the collapse of
 the SAWP ended its monopoly over the registration of citizens'
 groups. Groups or.parties that operate in more than one
 republic must register with the Federal Secretariat for
 Justice; those that only operate within one republic must
 register with that republic's Justice Ministry. At year's
 end, 35 political parties had registered on the federal
 level. Many others were registered in individual republics,
 totaling over 100 registered parties.
 There are still, however, serious restrictions on freedom of
 association under existing laws. The law against association
 for the purpose of hostile activities has been used to
 prosecute ethnic Albanians who advocate republic status for
 Kosovo. The maximum penalty for violating this law was reduced
 from 15 years to 5. No organizations which "stir up racial,
 ethnic, or religious hatred" are permitted, and no one who has
 been convicted of a crime may be a founder of a citizens'
 association. For example, in October Macedonian officials
 refused to register an Albanian cultural organization in
 Tetovo. In Serbia, republic officials refused registration to
 the Serbian Chetnik movement on the grounds that its name
 "offends public morality." The Serbian election law denies
 registration to any party that does not accept the territorial
 integrity of Serbia, a provision that is aimed at Albanian
 political parties, almost all of which seek separate status
 for Kosovo within Yugoslavia but outside Serbia.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Freedom of religion expanded significantly in Yugoslavia in
 1990, although the legal underpinning has not yet caught up
 with actual practice. Eastern Orthodox Christianity, Roman
 Catholicism, and Islam are the largest faiths in Yugoslavia.
 Religious believers havelong been free to practice their
 faith without direct persecution. In 1990 almost all
 restrictions related to the right to proselytize, publish, or
 sell religious materials, teach religion to young people, or
 own property were either eliminated or begah to be ignored.
 
 
 1351
 YUGOSLAVIA
 In practice, the extent of religious freedom varies from
 republic to republic. Most people in Yugoslavia are Serbian
 or Macedonian Orthodox, Roman Catholic, or Muslim. The Jewish
 community now has about 6,000 members and is active and well
 organized. Hebrew studies were begun again in 1990 at the
 University of Belgrade after almost a 30-year hiatus. The
 Jewish community in Zagreb has recently restarted a day care
 program dormant for almost 20 years. The newly elected
 government in Croatia has also strongly supported the
 rebuilding of the Zagreb synagogue destroyed in World War II.
 There is a small Protestant community in Yugoslavia which
 includes denominations such as Pentacostals,,Baptists, and
 Jehovah's Witnesses.
 Because religion is identified with ethnicity, ethnic clashes
 have sometimes sparked vandalism or threats of violence
 against members of minority religions. For example, the
 Serbian Orthodox Church in Ljubljana in primarily Roman
 Catholic Slovenia was painted with anti-Serbian graffiti
 several times in 1990, and the Orthodox Church in Sarajevo,
 where many Moslems live, was defaced in March. In mid-October
 youths reportedly harassed Serbian Orthodox priests in
 Zagreb. Orthodox graves were desecrated in Kosovo, most of
 whose Albanian population is Muslim. Mosques in Belgrade and
 Nis (both in Serbia) also were vandalized. One thousand
 Belgrade Muslims signed a petition in April condemning death
 threats against them and threats of arson against their
 mosque. Islamic facilities in Novi Sad, Vojvodina, were
 similarly threatened.
 In Kosovo, Serbs assert that Serbian Orthodox nuns have been
 harassed while attempting to carry out their religious or
 daily activities. In February Islamic elders issued a
 statement that 10 Kosovo imams were physically abused by
 Serbian police, and a member of the supreme body of the
 Islamic community, Osman Voksi, was killed on the doorstep of
 his house. (Roman Catholic Albanians were also harassed; see
 the case of Bishop Prelja in Section I.f.).
 The construction of new places of worship requires the consent
 of local government authorities, who in the past often raised
 bureaucratic impediments. In many cases, building permits for
 new religious facilities are now easier to obtain, but
 minority religions still face obstacles. For many years, the
 Islamic community has had a request pending to build a new
 mosque in Belgrade. In Split, a predominantly Catholic area,
 the Serbian Orthodox Church has long had difficulty getting
 permission to complete its cathedral. The Serbian Orthodox
 Church has sought permission to build a church in Veljine,
 near Sarajevo, for 18 years.
 Primary education under the auspices of religious
 organizations outside the state system is not permitted,
 although at year's end authorities in some republics were -
 considering introduction of religious education in state
 schools. However, 30 secondary religious schools and 12
 theological faculties train more than 2,000 pupils and 1,000
 seminarians annually. The degrees offered by these
 institutions are not officially recognized. All religious
 communities make vigorous efforts to provide religious
 instruction outside of-school for -children and young people.
 In July the newly elected Croatian government revoked a 1952
 decision to abolish the University of Zagreb's theology
 faculty, clearing the way for restoring theological studies at
 
 
 1352
 
 YUGOSLAVIA
 a public university. The new President of Croatia stated
 publicly that his government would broaden the rights of the
 Catholic Church and that the Church would be able to own and
 operate radio and television stations.
 Restrictions applied to religious believers during their
 obligatory military service were relaxed. Active-duty
 military personnel may now attend religious services and have
 religious materials in their possession. In 1989 the law on
 compulsory military service was changed to allow conscientious
 objectors to serve without bearing arms, but they must serve
 24 months rather than the usual 12. They are required to
 serve the full 2 years even if they have already completed a
 jail term for resisting the draft.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 The Constitution provides for freedom of movement within the
 country, and it is generally permitted in practice. Croatian
 authorities prevented a group of Serbs from entering the
 republic of Croatia in September to lay wreaths at the site of
 the World War II concentration camp in Jasenovac. Also in
 Croatia, 'Serbs in Knin in the early fall blocked rail and road
 traffic through the town on several occasions in protest over
 what they considered the hostile policies of the Croatian
 government.
 Yugoslavs generally do not require exit permits to leave, and
 passports are routinely available to most Yugoslavs. The
 authorities sometimes denied passports, however, to well-known
 dissidents. In 1990 Kosovo Albanian activist Dr. Zekeria
 Cana's passport was confiscated by Serbian authorities. Even
 though he was acquitted, the Serbian authorities initially
 refused to restore his passport. However, he was later able
 to get a passport from Croatian authorities and travel to the
 United States. Former political prisoners Azem Vlasi and Adem
 Demaqi were also denied passports by the Serbian government,
 although officials from the Federal Secretariat for Foreign
 Affairs publicly recommended that passports be issued to
 them. In March the Committee fot Internal Policy of the
 Federal Chamber of the Federal Assembly asked the Federal
 Executive Council (the Government).to "demystify" the
 procedures whereby passports are issued, extended, or
 confiscated. Changes to the passpbrt law were announced in
 October, reducing police discretion to deny or confiscate
 passports arbitrarily. Beginning in 1989, numbers of ethnic
 Albanians and Gypsies were denied passports for fear they
 would apply for asylum in the Federal Republic of Germany.
 Yugoslavia waived entry visa requirements for most countries
 in June. However, some people were still denied entry for
 political-reasons, as in the case of a Bulgarian group that
 wanted to lay a wreath at the tomb of Macedonian national hero
 Goce Delcev in July.
 The law on the entry of foreigners into Yugoslavia notes the
 right of permanent asylum and provides for government
 assistance to persons granted that right. However, in
 practice, Yugoslavia does not grant permanent asylum or
 provide assistance to refugees. Yugoslavia extends temporary
 asylum to refugees who, with the assistance of the United
 Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), seek permanent
 resettlement in third countries. At year's end, UNHCR had
 recognized 1,222 asylum seekers as genuine refugees, 811 of
 
 
 1353
 YUGOSLAVIA
 whom were from Albania. All asylum seekers who entered
 Yugoslavia without passports or visas served a 1-month jail
 sentence for "illegal border crossing" before being presented
 to UNHCR for resettlement. After the December uprising in
 Romania, the authorities temporarily stopped forcibly
 returning some Romanian asylum seekers but resumed the
 practice in March. In 1990 fewer Romanians sought asylum, and
 more than 200 voluntarily returned to Romania. At least 69
 Albanian asylum seekers were forcibly returned to Albania in
 1990 without the opportunity to present their case to UNHCR,
 and another 8 returned voluntarily. UNHCR officials believe
 that possibly seven additional recognized refugees were
 forcibly repatriated; Yugoslav officials have said only that
 two of these returned voluntarily.
 In 1990 Serbia began proceedings to expel ethnic Albanians who
 had derived refugee status from their parents, most of whom
 immigrated during or just after World War II. These Albanian
 refugees have lived all or most of their lives in Yugoslavia
 and in many cases were born there and have Yugoslav-citizen
 spouses and children. They cannot acquire Yugoslav
 citizenship and may in fact be stateless. Serbian officials
 alleged, without providing specifics, that the 17 Albanians
 from whom the Yugoslavs initially withdrew residence permits
 had been convicted of crimes--chiefly political offenses--such
 as taking part in "hostile demonstrations" or committing "acts
 against the political order and security of Yugoslavia." The
 UNHCR has refused to try to resettle the 17 on the grounds
 that they are covered by the 1951 U.N. Refugee Convention and
 the 1967 Protocol and are considered to be permanently settled
 in Yugoslavia.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 At the end of 1990, Yugoslav citizens did not have the ability
 to change the Federal Government through democratic means when
 the republics failed to reach agreement on amending the
 existing federal constitution. Multiparty elections were held
 in all six republics.
 In 1990 the League of Communists lost its monopoly on political
 power. It has ceased to function effectively at the federal
 level but still has varying degrees of power at the republic
 level. In April and May non-Communist parties or coalitions
 won free elections in Slovenia and Croatia. In November and
 December, multiparty elections- were held in the four remaining
 republics. The results of these four elections were varied;
 in Bosnia-Hercegovina a coalition of non-Communist nationalist
 parties took power, while in Macedonia nationalists, reformed
 Communists and a party associated with Federal Prime Minister
 Markovic won the largest share of the votes. In Serbia and
 Montenegro, the League of Communists or its successor party
 won large majorities. International observers found the
 election process in all Yugoslav republics, with the exceptiorr
 of Serbia, to be generally consistent with democratic rules
 and procedures. In Serbia, the actual voting in most districts
 generally appeared to have been conducted in a correct fashion.
 However, the Serbian authorities used their control of the
 media to conduct what amounted to a smear campaign against the
 opposition, while denying the oppbsition equal access to the
 media. The authorities denied the opposition equal access to
 office space and financial resources and harassed some
 opposition leaders by charging them with misdemeanors. There
 are widespread and credible reports that many people in Serbia
 
 
 1354
 YUGOSLAVIA
 were warned by the authorities not to vote for the opposition,
 and some were harassed, including being threatened with
 dismissal from their jobs, if they supported the opposition
 during the election campaign.
 In Kosovo Serbian authorities effectively eliminated local
 self-government. Following the Kosovo provincial government's
 declaration of separation from Serbia on July 2, the Serbian
 government suspended the provincial People's Assembly
 (legislature), the Executive Council, and judicial and
 security organs. Many district-level government bodies were
 also suspended or purged. Serbia based its move on a republip
 law on."special circumstances," passed in June.
 On September 13, delegates of the suspended Kosovo People's
 Assembly met in Kacanik and approved a new constitution, which
 declared Kosovo's sovereignty within Yugoslavia and separation
 from Serbia. As a result, Serbian authorities arrested 4
 delegates, issued arrest warrants for the other 107 delegates
 at the session, and began legal proceedings against 6 other
 former Kosovo government officials, including premier Jusuf
 Zejnulahu and provincial police chief Jusuf Karakushi. By the
 year's end, two of the six officials had been in detention for
 4 months, and others were still being sought by the police.
 Four delegates to the meeting in Kacanik had been indicted
 under Serbian law for "endangering the territorial integrity
 of Serbia."
 In Croatia, Serbian activists held a referendum on autonomy
 for Serb-inhabited areas. The Croatian authorities declared
 the referendum illegal, but it was held anyway, without
 significant police interference. Subsequently, the Serb
 inhabitants declared the 10 counties in which they predominate
 in Croatia a sovereign, autonomous region with a separate
 government and police force, all of which the Croatian
 government considered illegitimate.
 Federal and republican laws may be adopted and enforced in
 secrecy from the public. According to press accounts, a wide
 range of political, economic, and security-related laws have
 been adopted in this fashion since 1980. In 1990 Serbia used
 this procedure to adopt punitive measures against economic
 activities by other Yugoslav republics and to issue to itself
 large sums of money in secrecy.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Forum for Human Rights and the Protection of Citizens was
 established in late 1988 to monitor human rights practices
 throughout Yugoslavia. At the time of its inception, it was
 funded by'the SAWP. Despite this quasi-official status, the
 Forum criticized government practices and worked with
 redpected human rights organizations, including Amnesty
 International (AI). With the collapse'of the SAWP, the
 Forum's funding was eliminated in August. The Forum stated
 that it would continue to investigate human rights abuses in
 cooperation with other organizations, provided those
 organizations could provide fund~ng. The Federal Assembly
 voted in October to establish-,-its'own Committee on Human
 Rights. There is also an active community of domestic human
 rights organizations, including chapters of Helsinki Watch,
 whose contacts with its international parent organization are
 unhampered.
 
 
 1355
 
 YUGOSLAVIA
 Several countries and international organizations sent
 official delegations to examine human rights conditions in
 Kosovo and elsewhere, including the Council of Europe, the
 U.S. Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe, the
 German Bundestag, and the British Parliament. Nongovernmental
 agencies making factfinding visits in 1990 included Physicians
 for Human Rights, AI, the New York Bar Association, and the
 International Helsinki Federation (IHF).
 IThe IHF released a critical 40-page study on Kosovo, sharply
 ,criticized by the Serbian press and published in full in the
 daily, Borba. In September a four-person IHF delegation was
 detained by Serbian police and expelled. After initially
 denying that the delegation had been arrested or expelled,
 Serbian authorities later attempted to justify their actions
 by accusing the delegation of illegally importing medicines
 into Yugoslavia and having "hostile propaganda" (i.e.,
 documentation of alleged human rights abuses from ethnic
 Albanians) in its possession. In October the Federal
 ,Presidency reversed the expulsion order, but the Serbian
 government declined to recognize this action. A Norwegian IHF
 official was briefly detained by the police in Kosovo on
 October 19.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex,. Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 The Federal Constitution provides for equality of citizens
 regardless of sex, and the Federal Government is officially
 opposed to racial discrimination. Some social prejudice
 exists, however, particularly with regard to ethnic Albanians
 and Gypsies, who constitute 8 and G.7 percent respectively of
 Yugoslavia's population, according to the 1981 census.
 Macedonia limits social welfare payments to the first three
 children in a family, a policy aimed primarily at ethnic
 Albanians, who have the highest birthrate in Europe.
 Macedonian authorities have manipulated building code
 regulations governing the height of walls to justify the
 bulldozing of walls that traditionally surround Albanian homes
 in the republic, which is at least 20 percent ethnic Albanian.
 The death of an ethnic Albanian in one such bulldozing
 incident led to demonstrations in Kosovo in January. Job,
 educational, and housing discrimination against Albanians in
 Kosovo has become widespread as Serbian authorities seek to
 solidify their control of that province. The- Serbian
 government has also reserved student slots, in disproportion
 to the population, at the University of Pristina for ethnic
 Serbs and Montenegrins, many from outside Kosovo. Many slots
 reserved for ethnic Serbs and Montenegrins in the fall of 1990
 were not filled, while ethnic Albanians were denied the
 opportunity to study. In 1990 the Federal Constitutional
 Court declared a Serbian land sales law unconstitutional.
 This law had been used to punish Albanians who tried to buy
 land in Kosovo from Serbs. The Serbian sellers were seldom,
 if ever, prosecuted.
 Gypsy organizations claim that Gypsies are discriminated
 against. They cite Yugoslav sociological studies stating that
 Gypsies are the first to feel the effects of poverty,
 unemployment, and housing shortages and that they suffer from
 social segregation.
 The Serbian minority in Kosovo has complained of physical
 mistreatment by the ethnic Albanian majority. Reports of such
 
 
 1356
 
 YUGOSLAVIA
 mistreatment collected by members of the Serbian Orthodox
 clergy in 1990 include physical assault, the burning of
 property, and attempted rape. The Serbian minority in Croatia
 has complained of discrimination, citing such matters as
 limited availability of textbooks or newspapers in the
 Cyrillic alphabet.
 There is legal equality of the sexes under Yugoslav law.
 Maternity leave for employed women is routinely granted for
 periods between 9 and 12 months. Working mothers are given
 day care allowances based on their salaries and the number of
 children to be cared for. Also, a working mother may take
 sick leave when her child is ill (up until 2 years after its
 birth); and the father may do so when the mother is ill.
 Increasing public attention is being paid to the problem of
 violence against women. Hot lines, which usually operate only
 a few hours a day, were established for women in Belgrade,
 Ljubljana, and Zagreb in 1989, and two new hot lines were
 started in Kraljevo and Pula in 1990. In Belgrade alone, 700
 women called the hot line in a 7-month period in 1990. Legal
 penalties for spouse abuse are the same as those for assault
 on other persons, but the abused spouse must make out a
 complaint, and this is seldom done. Hot line workers complain
 there is little the police can or will do to intervene in a
 crisis unless neighbors complain. However, criminologists
 praised the hot lines, noting that police attitudes are slowly
 changing.
 Slovenia has a law against rape within marriage, and there is
 a petition in the Croatian Assembly to pass a similar law.
 Federal marriage laws allow a woman to keep her maiden name,
 to continue working if she wishes, and to have "equal input
 into the decision as to where the couple will live." There
 are feminist groups in the larger cities of Slovenia, Croatia,
 and Serbia campaigning for improvement in women's rights.
 In November Belgrade women's groups protested a Serbian
 parliamentary resolution which imposes an extra tax on
 childless persons over the age of 30. Feminists complained
 that this violated the Serbian constitution's provision of the
 right to decide freely on whether to bear children.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 The right of free association in trade unions became well
 established in some republics in 1990, but organizers in other
 republics continued to face legal and other obstacles. The
 issue of free association remains unregulated at the federal
 level. The Federal Constitution still accords certain rights
 (e.g., to'introduce legislation into the Federal Parliament)
 to the old official union organization, called since June 1990
 the Council of Independent Trade Unions of Yugoslavia (CITUY).
 The number of new unions rose dramatically in 1990. Eleven
 new trade unions under CITUY control were registered in 1990.
 Developments regarding labor unions in the republics are
 described below:
 Slovenia. The republic's constitution guarantees the
 right of free association in trade unions.' New unions, such
 as those for railroad engineers and journalists, had no
 trouble beginning operation outside the-CITUY system.
 
 
 1357
 
 YUGOSLAVIA
 Slovenia has no legal requirement for the registration of
 trade unions. The Council of Independent Trade Unions of
 Slovenia (an affiliate of the CITUY), moreover, agreed in 1990
 to a complete voluntary reregistration of the work force in
 which other unions have an equal chance to recruit members.
 Croatia. Registration of new unions is a legal
 requirement, but these unions had no problems in doing so.
 Several new unions in July formed a new central union, the
 Confederation of Independent Trade Unions of Croatia, to
 compete with the Council of Independent Trade Unions of
 Croatia, an affiliate of the CITUY. The Croatian unions also
 agreed to a complete voluntary reregistration of the work
 force.
 Serbia. The new constitution, adopted on September 28,
 guarantees the right to associate freely in trade unions.
 Until then, however, new unions were told that they could not
 become legal entities because the law made no provision for
 the existence of unions other than the previously official
 Serbian Union Council, an affiliate of the CITUY. That
 Council, meanwhile, continued to operate as it always had,
 with full recognition by the Serbian regime as a legal
 entity. Several unions, including those of truck drivers and
 commercial pilots, managed to operate despite legal problems.
 A Union of Television and Radio Workers was registered as an
 official organization in late September. Since then, several
 members were harassed and dismissed from their jobs.
 Kosovo. Serbia's province of Kosovo was a special case
 in 1990. Opposition leaders in Kosovo formed a new union
 organization called the Independent Trade Unions of Kosovo
 (ITUK), which claims as members virtually all ethnic Albanian
 workers in the province. Serbian political and union leaders
 claim that it is a "separatist" political organization and
 therefore illegal. Police harassed the union's founding
 congress in July, and the president of the Serbian Union
 Council has publicly urged that its activities be banned.
 Several enterprises in Kosovo under forcible "temporary
 management" by Serbia did just that.
 After calling for a general strike on Labor Day, ITUK
 President Dr. Hajrullah Gorani was arrested on August 23 and
 sentenced to 60 days in jail for "disturbing public peace and
 order" by stating that Serbian authorities are undertaking
 repressive measures against Albanian workers. He was released
 after 45 days. The peaceful Labor Day strike was observed by
 virtually all of the working and school age population. Most
 returned to work the next day, but over 40,000 Albanian
 strikers were later dismissed from their jobs. Some striking
 teachers were briefly detained, and other Albanian strikers
 charged with misdemeanors. Private businesses, which had
 closed in view of the strike, were padlocked by police and not
 allowed to reopen.
 Macedonia. New unions in Macedonia appear to have the
 legal right to register. Railroad workers successfully
 organized without serious problems. Attempts by 385 workers
 to organize at the EMO enterprise in Ohrid, however, met
 furious opposition from the old union and management.
 Disciplinary action was taken against leaders of the new
 union, and at least nine were suspended from their jobs. A
 court has since ruled management's actions illegal.
 
 
 1358
 YUGOSLAVIA
 Montenegro and Bosnia-Hercegovina. While some attempts
 were made to organize new unions in these republics, so far no
 new unions are known to have begun legal operations.
 The rightto strike is guaranteed by the Federal Constitution
 and is generally recognized in practice as well. Plans to
 complete a new law on strikes to better define the legal
 parameters came to nought in 1990. The right to strike
 includes, and is exercised by, workers in socially owned firms
 and the Government. Strikes are resolved by negotiations
 between the union or strike committee and management (and
 often politicians). Strikes occurred frequently during 1990,
 but unlike in years past the CITUY did not publish strike
 statistics. This may be due to the fragmentation of the union
 movement and its effects on data collection by a union that
 once reached into every single enterprise in the country.
 The notable exception with respect to the right to strike was
 Kosovo, where the Serbian government established a pattern in
 1990 of punishing and often firing ethnic Albanian workers who
 participated in strikes. The Serbian government announced on
 August 14 that any worker in a firm under forcible "temporary
 management" by Serbia who participated in a strike would be
 fired.
 Although not a participating member since 1950, the CITUY has
 good cooperation with the World Confederation of Labor and the
 European Trade Union Confederation. The CITUY, although not a
 member of the Communist-controlled World Federation of Trade
 Unions, has also begun cooperation with that body. In July
 the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions sent a
 factfinding mission to Yugoslavia to explore the possibilities
 of trade union cooperation with Yugoslavia.
 b. -The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 Western-style collective bargaining has not previously existed
 in Yugoslavia. A 1989 law on labor relations introduced the
 concept of "collective agreements" to be negotiated between
 the unions and the Chambers of Economy (semiofficial chambers
 of commerce), but the system was still coalescing in 1990.
 Theoretically, the Government's forced partial privatization
 of the socially owned sector of the economy (announced in
 June) will mean the gradual replacement of old self-management
 mechanisms with collective bargaining. Under self-management,
 workers elect a workers' council for their firm, which
 functions as the senior management body and elects the firm's
 director. Many critics (including most new trade unions),
 however, argue that collective agreements signed with the
 chambers are meaningless because, first, the chambers are
 merely associations of businessmen and the agreements
 therefore are not enforceable, and, second, until the question
 of property ownership is firmly resolved, there is no real
 representative of capital with whom labor can negotiate.
 Sentiment seems to be increasing for involvement of the State
 in signing collective agreements in order to assure labor that
 they will be binding on employers.
 Some types of enterprises, such as railroads, telephone
 companies, and airports, are being gradually turned into state
 property rather than privatized. Governments at various
 levels may try to use this process to apply different labor
 standards to employees in these industries,-particularly
 constraints on the right to strike. The Railroad Engineers'
 Union.in Croatia nearly staged a general-strike in July when a
 
 
 1359
 
 YUGOSLAVIA
 draft republic railroad law threatened to do just that, but
 the Government withdrew the objectionable provisions for the
 time being.
 There are no economic incentive zones nor any special
 industries where labor standards differ from those elsewhere
 in the country.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Forced labor is prohibited by the Federal Constitution and is
 generally not practiced. Serbian government use of the
 so-called work obligation in many Kosovo enterprises, however,
 bordered on forced labor, because refusal to work is
 punishable by administrative and criminal sanctions.
 d. Minimum Age for the Employment of Children
 The minimum age for employment of children is 16. The Federal
 and republic Secretariats for Labor, Health, and Social Policy
 are responsible for enforcement.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 Yugoslavia has an official 42-hour workweek, with generous
 vacation time and sick leave benefits. Republics set minimum
 wage levels, which vary widely in keeping with varied levels
 of economic development and, to a lesser extent, prices. The
 status of minimum wages was in flux during 1990. As a general
 principle, the government "guaranteed wage" is 75 percent of
 the republic's average wage. However, as the Yugoslav economy
 declined into recession in 1990, many firms found they were
 unable to pay the "guaranteed" wage and yet faced no legal
 penalties. Another complicating factor was that draft
 "collective agreements" at the republic level generally
 included a "minimum wage" standard well above the "guaranteed"
 wage. The legal status of these minimums was not clear.
 Yugoslavia has extensive federal and republic laws and
 regulations on worker safety. Occasional press reports and
 informal observations of the Yugoslav workplace suggest that
 enforcement of work safety rules is lax.
