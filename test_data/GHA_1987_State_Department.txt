 GHANA
 Ghana is governed by the Provisional National Defense Council
 (PNDC) pnder-the chairmanship of Flight Lieutenant'Jerry John
 Rawlings, who seized power from the previous elected Government
 on December 31, 1981. Under the Establishment Proclamation
 issued January 11, 1982, the Council exercises "all powers of
 government." In practice, government policy is developed by
 Chairman.Rawlings assisted by a number of close advisers, both
 inside and outside government. In addition to Chairman
 Rawlings, the PNDC consists of eight members, of which two are
 serving military officers and six are civilians (including one
 woman and one ex-military officer). The various government
 ministries are headed by secretaries, most of whom are
 .subordinate to a PNDC member responsible for that particular
 area of government. A country-wide network of Committees for
 the Defense of the Revolution (CDR's) is designed as a channel
 to transmit government policies to the citizens and citizen
 concerns to the. Government.
 Several security organizations in Ghana report to various
 sections of the Government, but all come under the control of
 the PVDC. Most security cases of a political nature are
 handled by the Bureau of National Investigation, which reports
 to both the Ministry of the Interior and the PNDC member
 responsible for security issues.
 Starting in 1983, the Government adoptedzan Economic Recovery
 Program in an effort-to redress a quarter century of economic
 mismanagement and political instability which,-combined with a
 severe drought in.the early i980's, .caused. Ghana to decline
 from ine of Africa's most promising economies to near collapse.
 Conducted in concert with the International Monetary Fund
 (IMF), World Bank (IBRD), and consultative groups of bilateral
 donors, the recovery program has had a positive effect. The
 economy has grown for 5 consecutive years (in 1987 by a
 projected 5 percent). Inflation, which had been brought down
 from triple digits to the teens, rose  again in 1987 to a
 projected 30 percent.
 Under Chairman Rawlings, a notable development has been the
 continuing restoration of-civil order after an imitial
 18-month period of revolutionary excess in 1982 and 1983.
 Discipline has generally been improved in the armed forces and
 the police. There were no coup plots reported in 1987. The
 Government, through a National Commission on Democracy
 established in 1984 under the chairmanship of a PNDC -mmber,
 continued in 1987 to "study" means of restoring a democratic
 system. In July 1987, guidelines were set out for district
 level elections. In October 1987, the Government began a
 process of registering voters for these elections. Procedures
 for future elections at the regional and federal levels have
 not been established. The potential for arbitrary deprivation
 of liberty was demonstrated by continuing instances of
 incarceration without formal charges during sometimes lengthy
 investigations. A system of public tribunals, which parallels
 the regular-court system, is designed to expedite the judicial
 process, but is criticized for not enforcing procedural
 safeguards, effectively enough to constitute due process.

 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There were no reported instances of politically motivated or
 governmentally instigated deaths.
 b. Disappearance
 No disappearances traceable to government action or to
 nongovernmental or opposition forces were reported.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 There have been occasional credible allegations of torture and
 beatings. In 1987 a jailhouse official was sentenced to death
 for beating a detainee to death but is appealing his case.
 Prisons in Ghana are antiquated, and conditions are stark.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, Exile, or Forced Labor
 Ghanaian security forces occasionally take persons into
 custody, with or without a warrant, and hold them incommunicado
 for extended periods of time. When the Ghana Bar Association
 has taken steps to try to free some of these persons, the PNDC
 has either stood aside and permitted their release or has
 retroactively interposed preventive custody orders barring
 their release and citing national security considerations as
 justification.
 In more routine criminal cases, detentions are generally
 performed in accordance with the legal procedures set forth in
 the criminal code. This code requires that an arrested person
 be brought before a court within 48 hours. However, the court
 can refuse to release a detainee on bail and instead "remand"
 him without charges for an indefinite period of time, subject
 to weekly review as a case is investigated. Habeas corpus is
 limited by a 1984 law which prevents any court from inquiring
 into the grounds for the detention of any Ghanaian under PNDC
 Law 2 (which set up the National Investigation Committee and
 gave the Committee the power to investigate virtually any
 allegation referred to it by the PNDC).
 There are no reliable estimates of the number of political
 detainees and prisoners in Ghanaian prisons. No minister of
 the prerevolutionary Government remains in detention. Some
 officials of the former Government who fled Ghana in 1982 and
 1983 have quietly returned and resumed careers outside of
 politics, apparently convinced that the danger of detention
 has now passed; others have assumed government posts.. The
 Government does not announce detentions or releases, but in
 1987, as in previous years, a number of prisoners remained in
 detention without charge or trial. In its 1987 Report,
 Amnesty International (AI) noted that at the end of 1986 at
 least 50 people, most of whom were believed to be military
 personnel, were being held without charge or trial under the
 Preventive Custody Law of 1982 (PNDC Law 4). In late July
 1987, AI issued a statement expressing concern at the arrest
 and detention of three Ghanaians on July 15 and stating that
 they may be "prisoners of conscience" imprisoned for the
 nonviolent expression of their political beliefs. The names
 
 
 121
 GHANA
 of these three individuals were added to an AI list of four
 other Ghanaians detained in May 1987 without charges.
 In 1987 two American citizens were arrested and held without
 charge for many weeks, and in neither case were U.S. Embassy
 officials notified of the arrests in a manner consistent with
 international law and practice. One of the Americans died in
 jail, apparently of natural causes, before the Embassy was
 notified of his arrest.
 Ghana prohibits forced labor, except in the case of convicted
 criminals. Convicts can be found working on private farms and
 construction sites as part of government, programs to reform
 and resocialize convicted criminals. There are no reported
 instances of forced exile. However, there are cases of
 Ghanaians abroad who hesitate to return for fear of political
 persecution.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 In the existing regular "prerevolutionary" court system,
 traditional legal safeguards are based on British legal
 practice, e.g., the right of defendants to present evidence
 and to cross-examine witnesses. This system includes high
 courts, appeal courts, and a Supreme Court headed by a Chief
 Justice. Questions exist, however, about the independence of
 the regular courts. 'In April 1986, the PNDC overturned one of
 its own decrees, which provided for full hearings before a
 judge could be removed from office, and summarily dismissed 16
 judges, including 2 judges of the Court of Appeal (Ghana's
 second highest court). -,The PNDC alleged that these judges
 were guilty of various-forms of malfeasance in office, but no
 formal charges were brought against them, and no hearings were
 ever held. Many legal observers believe that, by this action,
 the PNDC has put judges in the regular courts on notice that
 they serve at its sufferance. The Ghana Bar Association has
 urged the zeestablishment of a judicial council to protect
 judges from arbitrary dismissal and preserve judicial
 independence.
 A separate public tribunals system was set up in 1982 to
 parallel the regular court system. It includes the office of
 Revenue Commissioners, the National Investigations Committee,
 the Special Military Tribunal, and the Public Tribunals Board,
 as well as the public tribunals themselves, which operate at
 the national and regional levels and are planned for district
 and community levels. Critics have complained that there are
 no Ghanaian laws specifying which cases should go before these
 tribunals and which before the regular court system. The
 Government's announced purpose when it established this system
 was to provide more justice to more people in a more timely
 fashion by deemphasizin4 legal "technicalities." No appeals
 were permitted until 1985, when a National Appeals Tribunal
 was created. Critics contend that this system depends largely
 on judges with little or no legal experience and that it
 shortcuts legal safeguards in an effort to speed proceedings.
 The panels of presiding judges contain more laymen than.
 lawyers, there are no published guidelines concerning the
 admissibility of evidence, and conviction is by majority vote
 of the panel trying a case. Critics also contend that
 meaningful appeals are impossible because no adequate record
 is kept of initial hearings before tribunals. Judges on the
 appeals-panel are drawn from the same pool of "lay judges" who
 hear the initial cases. The public tribunals enforce the PNDC
 
 
 122
 GHANA
 policy of imposing the death penalty for offenses that are
 essentially economic in nature.
 The members of the Ghana Bar Association, citing such
 shortcomings, have elected not to practice before the
 tribunals. This means that in practice defendants may appear
 before the public tribunals with inadequate or no legal
 representation. In 1985 the Government approved the creation
 of a legal aid program, but this program is yet to be more
 than marginally implemented.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The individual citizen is, for the most part, free from
 interference by the State in his or her private conduct,
 although some critics fear that the Committees for the Defense
 of the Revolution (CDR's) have the potential to become
 "neighborhood watch committees." The Government holds that
 all citizens are "members" of the CDR's, although at present
 actual participation in the system is voluntary. Monitoring
 of telephones and mail is presumed to occur, but is rarely
 reported. Forced entry into homes has been reported in
 connection with security investigations. Informers exist and
 some Ghanaians hesitate to speak frankly at public gatherings.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The freedoms of speech and the press guaranteed under the now
 suspended 1979 Constitution have been abrogated, but the PNDC
 Chairman has publicly encouraged people to speak out on local
 community concerns, though not on government policy. The
 Government owns the radio and television stations and the two
 principal daily newspapers. Reporting on external events
 draws heavily from various wire services and tends to reinforce
 the Government's foreign policies; the press avoids criticism
 of Ghana's foreign policies. The press also avoids criticism
 of the revolution or of Chairman Rawlings and PNDC members. In
 general, it accentuates positive aspects of the revolution,
 but does on occasion report instances of corruption and
 mismanagement. Critics have charged that fear of government
 retaliation has led to a "culture of silence." Private
 organizations such as the Ghana Bar Association voice
 occasional dissent from official policies but are typically
 denied access to the media and have difficulty reaching the
 public with their views.
 Several privately owned newspapers have tried to be relatively
 bold in reporting selected issues. The Pioneer, one of three
 remaining independent papers, has at times criticized the
 Economic Recovery Program. However, many privately owned
 newspapers, for various reasons, have since closed down. In
 1986 the Government limited supplies of newsprint to the
 independent press, thereby reportedly forcing one newspaper
 into bankruptcy. In December 1985, the Government banned
 publication of the Catholic Standard; it remains banned.
 Foreign periodicals such as West Africa are sold freely
 throughout Ghana; there appears to be no attempt to exercise
 censorship. Western journalists are now routinely accorded
 visas and press credentials as opposed to the practice of a
 few years ago.

 GHANA
 Academic freedom tends to be respected within the confines of
 the campus. In the spring, university students demonstrated
 over campus issues which assumed political overtones.
 Eventually all three universities were closed in midsemester,
 but they reopened several months later when courses were
 completed and examinations held. Students dismissed at the
 time of the spring demonstrations by the Government were
 allowed to return to campus.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Individuals generally are free to join together formally or
 informally to promote benevolent or nonviolent causes, but
 restrictions remain on association for the purpose of
 protesting government policies. Political meetings are
 banned, and political parties are not permitted. Permits are
 required for public meetings but are routinely granted except
 when the meeting has an overtly political purpose.
 The Trades Union Congress (TUC) is led by officials freely
 elected in 1983. The next TUC convention, at which new
 officials are to be elected, was scheduled for December 1987
 but postponed until early 1988 for organizational reasons.
 The TUC is associated with the International Labor Organization
 (ILO) and with the Organization of African Trade Union Unity
 (whose headquarters are located in Accra). The right to
 strike is recognized in law and in practice, although the
 Government has taken strong-actions to end strikes, especially
 those which threaten interests it perceives to be vital.
 Wildcat and unauthorLzed strikes numbered 19, in.1986 and 17 in
 1987.
 Trade unions engage in collective bargaining with both private
 sector and state-owned enterprises, though in the latter
 category there are indications that the Government has, on
 occasion, used brief detentions and threats against union
 leaders to. force agreement on issues. At the -end of 1987, no
 union officials were under detention for union-related
 activities. During a period of tension in the spring involving
 students and union members, the government-controlled press
 sharply criticized some unions and union leaders, and there
 were allegations of other government pressure against the
 unions behind the scenes.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 There is no state-favored religion and no restriction on the
 exercise of religion or on contacts with others of the same
 faith. Most Ghanaians, including senior government officials,
 are practicing members of religious groups, and there are no
 particuaar advantages or disadvantages to membership in any of
 them. The PNDC has been sensitive to church criticism of
 Ghana's human rights record, and in 1987 Chairman Rawlings
 renewed the charge that worldwide church and Christian
 organizatigns may be havens for foreign spy networks. The
 Chairman has also criticized importation of commodities in the
 name of the church to avoid import duties. The PNDC has
 banned religious publications for alleged political content.
 Foreign missionary groups operate throughoutthe country,
 although religious groups which advocate refusal to recognize
 Ghanaian symbols of authority have been strongly criticized by
 the Government. In September seven teachers -who were
 Jehovah's Witnesses were dismissed from their jobs for
 refusing to recite the national pledge of allegiance or sing
 the national anthem.

 GHANA
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 People are free to move from one part of the country to another
 without special permission. Police roadblocks continue to
 exist countrywide, allegedly for the prevention of smuggling,
 but are less obtrusive than in the 1982-84 period. Roadblocks
 and car searches are still a normal part of nighttime travel
 in Accra but are no longer conducted during the day.
 As members of the Economic Community of West African States
 (ECOWAS), Ghanaians are eligible to travel without visas for
 up to 90 days anywhere in West Africa. Ghanaians are generally
 free to exercise this right, and nationals of other member
 states are free to travel to Ghana. The Ghana-Togo border,
 closed following allegations by Togo of Ghanaian involvement
 in a 1986 coup attempt against the Government of Togo, was
 reopened in the summer. The major restraints on travel by
 Ghanaians are lack of foreign exchange and long delays in the
 issuance of passports. Ghanaians are free to emigrate or to
 be repatriated from other countries. If a person is considered
 a security threat, special permission to travel outside Ghana
 must be obtained.
 There is no forced resettlement of populations. While
 unregistered refugees from the Sahelian drought in neighboring
 countries remain, efforts to settle these basically nomadic
 people have had only limited success. Only some 150 refugees
 are registered with the United Nations Human Rights Commission,
 and they do not constitute a significant problem for the
 Government.
 Section 3 Respect For Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Under PNDC Law 42, Chairman Rawlings and the PNDC exercise
 total executive, legislative, judicial, and administrative
 power in Ghana. There is no current procedure by which
 citizens can freely and peacefully change their laws,
 officials, or form of government. The National Commission on
 Democracy was established in 1984 to design new democratic
 structures which would eventually replace Ghana's existing
 provisional system. On July 1, 1987 a "blue book" was
 published on the "creation of district political authorities
 and modalities for district-level elections.". Voter regis-
 tration was conducted in October and November 1987 for the
 election of district assemblies in the last quarter of 1988.
 However, the duties and areas of authority of these district
 assemblies remain vague. No plans have been announced for
 regional or national elections. Efforts to give substance to
 the revolutionary slogan, "power to the people," have included
 elections for leadership positions at the local level of the
 Committees for the Defense of the Revolution.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government cooperates with the International Committee of
 the Red Cross, and there is a chapter of AI in Ghana. There
 are several other groups in Ghana concerned with human rights,
 and they tend to be objective but not especially vocal or
 effective in their reporting. Nevertheless, various
 independent groups and organizations have worked for and have
 sometimes succeeded in gaining the'release of persons from
 
 
 125
 GHANA
 custody. As far as is known, no representatives of
 international human rights organizations visited Ghana in
 1987. Ghana has neither signed nor ratified the African
 Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Discrimination based on race, language, religion, or social
 status is not an issue in Ghana. Women's rights in business
 and the civil service have.long-been well established and
 respected. One woman serves as a member of the ruling PNDC,
 another serves in the Cabinet, and at least six hold subcabinet
 positions. Women in Ghana  ave traditionally had a major
 societil role. Women in urban centers and those who have
 entered modern society encounter little apparent bias, but
 role pressures do exist. Women in the rural agricultural
 sector remain subject to constraints associated with
 traditional mores of male dominance, in spite of efforts by
 the Government to curtail such practices.
 In 1985 the Government promulgated four laws which overturned
 many of the discriminatory customary, traditional, and colonial
 laws; these concerned family accountability, intestate
 succession, customary divorce registrations, and the
 administration of estates.
 CONDITIONS OF LABOR
 Working conditions in Ghana are governed by labor legislation
 which specifically prohibits forced labor, sets a minimum
 employment age of 15, and prohibits night work and certain
 types of hazardous employment for those under 18 years of
 age. In fact, child labor is prevalent, for example, on local
 buses where children of the drivers often serve as money
 collectors. The minimum wage, which applies to Government
 employees but is only indicative for the private sector, was
 raised 25 percent on January 1, 1987. Through both government
 directives and union contracts, the normal hours of work are
 defined in terms of a 40-hour week. Labor legislation
 provides for labor inspectors and gives them the power to
 order the alteration or closing of any work site "to avert any
 threat to the health or safety of the workers." Inspections
 take place and are as effective as possible under
 circumstances of a troubled national economy and scanty
 resources- Terms of employment and protection against
 arbitrary discharge are also covered by existing legislation.
