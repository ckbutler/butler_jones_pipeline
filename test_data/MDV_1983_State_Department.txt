 MALDIVES
 
 The Republic of Maldives consists of about 1,200 small islands,
 of which only 200 are inhabited, scattered over an area 500 by
 75 miles in the Indian Ocean. Just under a quarter of the
 168,000 Maldivians live on Male, the capital island, which is
 400 miles west-southwest of Sri Lanka. Maldivians ethnically
 are similar to the peoples of Sri Lanka and northern India, but
 their culture has been influenced by centuries of contact with
 the Arab world and by their strong adherence to Islam.
 The Maldives is governed by a strong president with
 considerable authority who is assisted by a cabinet of
 ministers, whom he appoints, and a unicameral legislature, the
 Majlis, elected by universal adult franchise. This system
 reflects the authoritarian tradition of the Maldives: from the
 advent of Islam in the 12th century until 1968, except for two
 brief periods, the country was ruled by hereditary sultans,
 even when it was a British protectorate from 1887 to 1965. The
 Maldivian Government is highly centralized, with authority
 concentrated in Male in the hands of the president and a small
 educated elite.
 The Maldives has experimented With several forms of government
 since the 1930's, including an elected sultanate and a
 short-lived republic in 1953. The second republic was created
 by the present Constitution, which came into force in 1968. It
 guarantees basic human rights but does not define clearly the
 powers of the president and the separation of powers among the
 president, Majlis, and judiciary. In 1979 the Majlis passed a
 motion seeking a new constitution. President Maumoon Abdul
 Gayoom suggested the model for a new, more liberal constitution
 in July 1981, and a draft was submitted for review by a
 90-member Citizens Special Majlis. This body failed to
 complete the review by the first target date, December 22,
 1982. Debate continues, but no new target date has been set.
 The Maldives has a 1,000-man National Security Service which is
 responsible for maintaining law and order, protecting the
 president, defending the country, and preventing foreign
 fishermen from encroaching on Maldivian fishing grounds. The
 police division of the Service investigates crimes, makes
 arrests, and enforces house arrest. People held before trial
 are either under house arrest, under the jurisdiction of the
 Civil Prisons Department, or kept at a detention center on an
 island near Male.
 Maldivians describe their government as a democracy, but
 perhaps "emerging democracy" is more accurate. Maldivians in
 general do not regard their government as repressive. There
 are strong social restrictions against some actions of
 individuals and groups, but these begin at the family level,
 are due largely to the influence of Islam, and are regarded by
 Maldivians as necessary and acceptable social norms.
 To be a Maldivian is to be a Muslim. For women, however, life
 in the Maldives is not as restrictive as it is in some other
 Muslim countries, and a conscious effort is made by both the
 Government and Maldivian women to broaden opportunities for
 women.

 The human rights picture in the Maldives has not changed since
 the 1982 human rights report. 'The Maldivian Government
 respects individual human rights. It has allowed the gradual
 development of a democratic political ethic among Maldivians,
 but habits of active political participation among Maldivians
 are only rudimentary at present. A presidential election and
 four by-elections to the MaJlis were held in 1983. President
 Gayoom was nominated by the Majlis for a second five-year term
 and was the only candidate in a nationwide referendum, and
 received 95.62 percent of the votes with 85 percent of the
 electorate participating. In June, Gayoom granted amnesty to
 20 prisoners, including 13 who were involved in an attempted
 coup d'etat in 1980. It was reported in July that an attempt
 to affect the presidential nomination process was discovered;
 four Majlis members were alleged to have taken bribes in return
 for supporting an alternate candidate to Gayoom for president.
 The four were placed under house arrest, tried, and banished to
 remote islands for 11 years. Two High Court judges, reported
 as also involved in this attempt, are under house arrest.
 Maldives is one of the world's least developed countries.  Of
 the 20 percent of the population that has been educated, the
 majority have not studied beyond the primary level. The
 economy is mixed, a combination of state ownership, joint
 ventures, and individual enterprises. The Government is trying
 to develop and modernize the economy. It has encouraged
 improvements in the main industry, fishing, and has supported
 the rapid growth of the tourist industry, often joining with
 private individuals or foreign investors to build tourist
 resorts. Also, the Government sponsored the development of
 textile factories on Gan Island and on an island in Male
 Atoll. Individuals are free to pursue private interests as
 long as they do not violate the civil law or the Shari'a, the
 Islamic legal code.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Unlawful or Arbitrary Deprivation of Life
 There were no reports of killings for political reasons in 1983.
 b. Disappearance
 In 1983, there were no reports that individuals disappeared,
 were abducted, or were taken hostage by the security forces.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 The Constitution stipulates that "under no condition shall a
 torture considered to be injurious be inflicted upon any
 person." The Government neither condones nor practices
 torture, and there have been no reports or allegations of
 torture in 1983
 Maldivians follow Shari'a (Islamic) law, and occasionally
 violators are flogged. Usually, punishment is confined to less
 physical means: fines, payment of compensation, house arrest,
 
 
 1349
 imprisonment, or banishment to a sparsely populated island,
 where the prisoner must earn his daily keep. Although there
 are no prisons as such in the Maldives, there is a "detention
 center" on Male, and another on an island near Male which is
 used for pretrial detention or imprisonment after trial of
 people who are deemed a danger to the state or who would be in
 danger if held on Male. There have been no reports of
 unacceptable conditions in these centers.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 There have been no reports of persons being subjected to
 arbitrary arrest, detention, or exile. Maldivians are not
 detained, punished, or tried for expressing in private views
 that are different from or critical of those of the
 Government. Any citizen may criticize or complain to the
 Government without fear if he does so through recognized
 channels, such as via letters or oral complaints to the
 president, to a Majlis member, or to a civil servant or other
 person in authority. But a person could be banished for a
 number of years if charged with arousing people against the
 lawful Government. No such cases are known to have occurred in
 1983.
 The Constitution requires that "no person shall be apprehended
 or arrested, except on a verdict specified by Shari'a or
 (civil) law". Acting on information or complaints received,
 the Attorney General's office passes the case to the
 appropriate court and the judge then instructs the police to
 undertake an investigation. The suspect is questioned at
 police headquarters and may, depending upon the charges, be
 detained or placed under house arrest for 15 days while the
 case is being investigated. If the case is not brought to
 trial within 15 days, the suspect is freed. Detention or house
 arrest may be extended after the first 15 days by authority of
 the president, but usually for not more than one month. There
 is no provision under Maldivian law for preventive detention.
 While there are no provisions for bail, an arrested person who
 has valid reasons to travel may receive permission to do so
 from the court handling his case.
 Four Majlis members banished for bribery all were tried within
 a month of their arrest. Two High Court judges alleged to be
 involved in the same incident still are under house arrest.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 A person accused of crime is given a trial. During a trial the
 accused may defend himself and may call witnesses to speak on
 his behalf. He also may be assisted by a lawyer, but there are
 few lawyers and lawyers are not provided by the courts. The
 accused is sentenced by the judge, with the length and type of
 sentence as established by the law and custom.
 The Republic of Maldives has a High Court and eight lesser
 courts in the capital at Male, each dealing with specific types
 of cases (e.g., debt, theft, property claims). On other
 inhabited islands there are courts that deal with all types of
 cases. Judges are trained in Islamic Law and are appointed by
 the president and serve at his pleasure, and thus cannot be
 considered fully independent. Cases in island courts that
 
 
 1350
 present knotty legal points are referred to the appropriate
 specialized court at Male, whose judge may in turn refer the
 legal point to four judges attached to the Ministry of Justice
 for assistance and advice. The High Court acts as a court of
 appeal, and handles cases of a political nature such as the
 trials of the participants in the attempted coup d'etat in 1980
 and of the four Majlis members found guilty of bribery in 1983.
 There are only a few Maldivians serving sentences for crimes
 which can be considered as political acts: six persons found
 guilty of involvement in the 1980 coup still are banished to
 outer islands, and the four Majlis members found guilty of
 unconstitutional activity and taking bribes began their 11
 years of banishment in August 1983.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Constitution specifically prohibits the opening,
 intercepting, reading, or making public of letters, telephone
 conversations, telegrams, and wireless messages exchanged
 between persons "except in accordance with the specific
 provisions of the law". There have been no reports of
 complaints in 1983 that the Government monitors correspondence
 or telephone conversations or uses a system of informers. The
 Government does not interfere with the right to marry, nor does
 it seek forcibly to resettle the population.
 The Constitution also requires that private premises and
 dwellings be respected and "therefore they shall not be entered
 into except under conditions and in a manner stipulated in the
 law". There have been no reports of practices to the contrary.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including,
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution guarantees freedom of speech and expression of
 oral and written thought "so long as the specific provisions of
 Shari'a and the law are not contravened". Given their long
 tradition of authoritarian rule, Maldivians are careful when
 expressing their opinions to foreigners or in the media, but
 may be frank in private when discussing and criticizing the
 Government.
 There are three privately owned newspapers in the Maldives.
 The first news agency was established in August 1983. All are
 required to register with the Government. Before 1983 there
 were no newspapers owned by the Government, which did not want
 to create an official press. In January 1983, however, it
 began issuing a newssheet for posting on walls on all islands
 where atoll offices are located, and in July expanded the
 program to cover all inhabited islands. There are no
 prohibitions on the importation of foreign publications, except
 pornography, and foreign broadcasts are not jammed.
 Although there is no prior censorship of newspapers, writers
 and editors are subject to prosecution if articles contravene
 laws, such as the one which prohibits arousing opposition to
 the legally established Government. In the past, writers and
 editors have been questioned about articles, fined, and put
 
 
 1351
 under house arrest, but there were no reports of such incidents
 in 1983.
 The Government does not restrict academic freedom. Maldivians
 are free to acquire and impart knowledge "in a manner that does
 not contravene Shari'a or civil law".
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Constitution assures freedom of assembly and association,
 but it appears that Maldivians make little use of these
 freedoms in a political sense. The majority of rallies and
 meetings seem to be those sponsored or approved by the
 Government and commonly are addressed by officials or religious
 leaders. Clubs and other private associations, of which there
 are many, are permitted to function if they do not contravene
 Shari'a and civil law and if they register with the Government.
 There are no trade unions, and no reports of workers in the
 Maldives attempting to form unions in 1983. There is no
 prohibition of trade unions, though Maldivians are forbidden to
 be members of the trade unions of other countries. Until the
 1970's, most Maldivians either were self-employed or held
 government jobs. Now, with the rapid growth of the tourist and
 textile industries, workers might consider forming unions.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 The Constitution makes Islam the official religion and all
 Maldivian citizens are Muslims. There are no churches or
 shrines for the practice of other religions. Missionaries of
 non-Muslim faiths have not gone to the Maldives. Conversion of
 Muslims to any other faith would be a violation of the
 Shari'a. Though these facts show a legal restriction on the
 practice of religion other than Islam, there have been no
 reports of any individuals who have complaints about such
 restrictions, or of Maldivians declared stateless or barred
 from any of the rights of citizenship because of a desire to
 profess a different faith.
 d. Freedom of Movement within the Country, Foreign Travel,
 Emigration, and Repatriation
 Maldivians are free to move about the country at will unless
 they are under house arrest, under detention, or banished.
 However, the Government discourages Maldivians from changing
 islands of residence, primarily because most recent migrants
 have moved to Male which, with just under a quarter of the
 country's population, is becoming severely overcrowded. Male
 attracts new residents because it has the country's best school
 system and medical facilities, and offers more job
 opportunities. The Government reimposed regulations in 1982
 that limit immigration to the capital island and its
 surrounding atoll. The regulations permit migration to Male
 only for short periods in order to work, be educated, or
 receive medical treatment. At the same time, the Government
 has made a major effort to improve social and educational
 services and develop industry outside of Male. For example, it
 has provided new schools, homes, and a textile factory on a
 different island of Male Atoll.
 
 30-231 0 - 84 - 86
 
 
 1352
 
 Maldivians are free to change jobs. There are no restrictions
 on foreign travel or on emigration, and there are no exit
 visas. The Government requires any Maldivian who has acquired
 another nationality to maintain Maldivian nationality
 concurrently. Such a person must enter and leave the Maldives
 on a Maldivian passport. As far as is known, the Government
 never has revoked the citizenship of any Maldivian. There are
 no refugees or displaced persons in the Maldives and, so far as
 is known, no Maldivians have been exiled or are refugees or
 displaced persons elsewhere.
 One form of punishment for convicted criminals is banishment to
 remote islands in the country. On such an island, those
 banished are required to perform some work to support
 themselves, and normally are prevented from leaving until the
 ends of their fixed periods of banishment.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to
 Change their Government
 There are no organized political parties in the Maldives, though
 parties are not forbidden by law. President Gayoom in a speech
 in July expressed views on parties that seem to be widely shared
 among his countrymen. He said that political parties come into
 existence to protect, maintain, or obtain rights for certain
 ethnic groups or sects. As there are no religious or linguistic
 conflicts in the Maldives, he claimed, no one is deprived of his
 or her rights. Gayoom said that forming political parties would
 only be a cheap imitation of the West and inappropriate to the
 homogenous nature of Maldivian society.
 All individuals aged 21 or over may participate in the Maldivian
 political process. Any qualified citizen may stand for election
 to the Majlis, appealing to the voters on the basis of
 experience and personal qualifications. Citizens choose their
 Majlis representatives by secret ballot. Of 48 members, 40 are
 elected (two from each atoll and two from Male) and eight are
 appointed by the president. The term of office for the Majlis
 is five years and the last general election was in 1980. There
 were nineteen candidates in a Majlis by-election in August 1983.
 The Majlis chooses by secret ballot, from as many candidates as
 are proposed by members of the Majlis, a single nominee for
 president. The nomination then is confirmed or rejected in a
 nationwide referendum, also by secret ballot. On August 22,
 1983, the Majlis voted 47 to one to nominate Gayoom to a second,
 five-year term. On September 30, Maldivians went to the polls
 and confirmed this nomination by giving Gayoom 95.62 percent of
 their votes. At the time of this nomination and confirming
 referendum, President Gayoom was long-established in office and
 there was not any serious competitor for the position. It is
 difficult to judge whether his leadership is widely accepted
 without objection or reservation by the large percentage of the
 electorate who confirmed him for a second term of office, or
 whether he somehow used his presidential powers to prevent
 actively the emergence of any alternate candidate for the office.
 There being no political parties, factions in the Majlis tend to
 coalesce around individuals or points of view and vary. according
 to the issue. Any member may introduce legislation which, if it
 is seconded, must be considered by the Majlis. All laws must be
 approved by the Majlis or by a Citizens Special Majlis such as
 
 
 1353
 the body which is reviewing the new constitution. The Majlis
 has the power to question ministers and to call for their
 removal. In practice, the Majlis generally supports the
 Government after carefully discussing and amending its proposals.
 Government control in the small, homogenous society of the
 Maldives is exercised by a limited group of individuals with a
 common background and outlook whose authority generally and
 traditionally is acknowledged and accepted by the population.
 Most of the ruling elite group are from the capital, Male, and
 are relatively well-educated.
 Clearly, habits of political participation and the organization
 of interest groups to pursue goals through the political process
 are not well developed among Maldivians. The Government has
 allowed the gradual development of democratic structures in
 society, but these still are rudimentary.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 There were no requests for outside investigation of human rights
 violations in the Maldives in 1983. There are no local official
 or unofficial human rights organizations. Amnesty International
 did not include the Maldives in its 1983 annual report. Freedom
 House rates the Maldives "partly free."
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 The dominant factors in the economic and social life of the
 Maldives are the comparative isolation of Maldivians from the
 world outside their country and of inhabitants of the islands
 from each other and from Male.
 The Government is improving the standard of living of the
 people, partly by working to increase the production of
 traditional Maldivian products such as fish and coconuts. It
 also is trying to tempt inhabitants of Male to return to their
 native islands or atolls with prospects of employment and better
 social services there. Programs are underway to replace coconut
 trees with better strains, make better use of the limited arable
 land (only 10 percent of total land), and introduce vegetables
 in family gardens. The Government has an extensive program to
 mechanize fishing boats and has purchased fish processing
 ships. There are efforts to increase the annual catch of fish
 through improved technology.
 The Government also has encouraged rapid expansion of the
 tourist industry. From 1978 to 1982, tourist lodging capacity
 expanded from 1,300 to 4,100 beds, and the number of visitors
 expanded from 30,000 to 75,000 annually. Until several years
 ago the Government permitted development of tourist resorts only
 on islands not inhabited by Maldivians, and around Male where
 most educated, travelled, sophisticated Maldivians live, in part
 to lessen the impact of tourism on the conservative society of
 the Maldives. But in the expansion of the tourist industry in
 the last several years the Government has permitted new
 development of tourism on islands in Ari Atoll, in part to
 provide employment opportunities.
 
 
 1354
 One island, Gan, had a severe unemployment problem after the
 British closed an airbase there in 1976. To provide new
 employment, the Government encouraged development of a textile
 industry with foreign investment. Another textile factory is
 under construction in Male Atoll.
 In 1983 the Government continued its programs to improve medical
 services to the people outside of Male. In addition to the
 central hospital in Male, which is fairly well-equipped, a
 hospital was opened in a northern atoll and construction
 continues on a third hospital in the southernmost atoll. The
 Government also has instituted a program to have a family health
 worker on every occupied island and a more highly trained health
 worker in every atoll. Health care remains rudimentary,
 however, as seen by the relatively low life expectancy at birth
 (46.5 years) and high inflant mortality rate (121 per 1,000 live
 births). The annual population growth rate, at 3.0 percent, is
 high. Only 15 percent of Maldivians (54 percent in Male) have
 ready access to potable water.
 Only 44 percent of MAldivians have completed primary education,
 and in 1983 there were not more than 70 college graduates in the
 country. When the Government of President Gayoom came to power
 in 1978, Male had the best schools in the country, with primary
 schools in each of the island's four wards and the only two
 secondary schools in the country. Most Maldivians who received
 any education were taught reading, writing, arithmetic, and
 religion by untrained teachers in island schools. The present
 Government has made rapid progress in education. There is now a
 government school, with trained teachers and a much broader
 curriculum, in every atoll. At present, these schools serve
 only the children on the islands where they are located. The
 Government's long-term goal is to have such schools on every
 inhabited island. The Government is in the process of building
 community education centers in every atoll. So far, 15 either
 have been or are being built. The Government has established an
 advanced level secondary school and a vocational training center
 on Male Island, and plans to build vocational training centers
 in some of the outer atolls.
 The Government claims that overall literacy is 82 percent, with
 no significant difference between the rates for men and women.
 It says that rates do vary among different age groups, with
 highest literacy in the younger age groups. According to World
 Bank figures, however, the percentage of those who are
 considered to read at "satisfactory" or "very good" levels is 44
 percent for men and 41 percent for women. The adjusted school
 enrollment ratio is 36.2 percent. There are no universities in
 the Maldives. The Government of President Gayoom seeks
 scholarships for promising students to study at universities in
 the Middle East, India, Australia, and the United Kingdom.
 Maldives continues to be one of the world's least developed
 countries, with a per capita gross national product of $373 in
 1982. Calorie supply in 1977 was only 77.6 percent of
 requirements. Most Maldivians still work in traditional
 occupations:  fishing, the largest industry involving about 46
 percent of the population; harvesting coconuts for copra and
 making rope; and some subsistence farming. The tourist and
 textile industries are providing much-needed new occupations.
 
 
 1355
 By Islamic and Maldivian tradition, women play a lesser role
 than men in public life. No women are serving as elected
 members of the Majlis, President Gayoom appointed one. There
 are three women in the Citizens Special Majlis that is reviewing
 the proposed constitution. Women do hold responsible positions
 in the civil service and the President has appointed two women
 as aides and another to be his Director of Social Affairs. In
 1982, President Gayoom appointed a National Women's Committee
 which is seeking ways to increase participation by women in the
 country's life. The committee celebrated International Women's
 Day in March 1983 with rallies and a march through Male, the
 first such march ever held in the Maldives. The limited role of
 women in public life is reflective of traditional attitudes of
 Maldivian society as a whole.
