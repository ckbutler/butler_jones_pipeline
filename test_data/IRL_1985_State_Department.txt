 IRELAND
 The Republic of Ireland is a parliamentary democracy with a
 long tradition of orderly transfer of power. Individual
 liberties and civil rights are guaranteed by the 1937 Irish
 Constitution.
 Successive Irish Governments have had to deal with the
 spillover into the Republic of recurring outbreaks of violence
 in Northern Ireland. In recent years, the spillover of
 violence has included the assassinations of the British
 Ambassador (1976) and Lord Mountbatten (1979), as well as the
 deaths of individual police officers, soldiers, and others due
 to the actions of the Provisional Irish Republican Army (PIRA)
 and Irish National Liberation Army (INLA) elements. This
 violence has led successive Irish Governments to adopt special
 legislation to-deal with acts of terrorism. During 1985 the
 Government has sought to apply such special legislation with
 fairness and balance.
 Ireland attaches great importance to the observance and
 maintenance of human rights both in theory and practice. It
 places strong emphasis on human rights in formulating foreign
 policy and plays an active role in human rights questions in
 the United Nations.
 On November 15, 1985, the Irish and British Governments
 concluded an agreement which gives the Irish Government a
 consultative role in certain Northern Ireland affairs. Both
 the Irish and British Parliaments subsequently approved the
 agreement.
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 Politically motivated killings occasionally occur in Ireland
 as a spillover from the violence in Northern Ireland. In
 these cases, such groups as PIRA or INLA usually claim
 responsibility. There were at least three slayings generally
 attributed to these two groups in the Republic in 1985; in one
 of these PIRA claimed responsibility. Both the Government and
 the population as a whole strongly deplore these actions. The
 Government uses the full force of the law to pursue and
 prosecute such cases.
 b. Disappearance
 People are not abducted, secretly arrested, or held in
 clandestine detention by the Irish authorities, nor does the
 Irish Government condone such practices by any element of
 society. Various terrorist groups have sometimes resorted to
 kidnapping for political purposes, most recently in 1983. In
 all such cases of political kidnapping, the Irish Government
 uses full police power either to prevent or solve the crime.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Freedom from torture and cruel, inhuman, or degrading
 punishment is respected in practice by the Government. From

 IRELAND
 time to time, including in Amnesty International's 1985
 Report, allegations are made that individual officers have
 used physical abuse during interrogations or have mistreated
 prisoners. Such allegations are investigated by the
 Government, and, where warranted, charges have been brought or
 convictions overturned. Some civil rights groups, however,
 are not fully satisfied with existing investigative
 procedures, and the Government plans to introduce legislation
 establishing an independent Police Complaint Review Board.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The Constitution contains provisions implementing its
 guarantee that "no citizen shall be deprived of his personal
 liberty save in accordance with law." For example, it
 requires that full charges, in writing, be made available to
 any individual placed under arrest. Neither in law nor in
 practice is anyone subject to arrest for the expression of
 political or religious views. Arrest is carried out openly by
 warrant, and the right to a fair and speedy trial with full
 right of legal counsel exists in law and practice. Detention
 without charge is restricted. It is, however, permitted for a
 maximum of 48 hours in cases tried in "special courts" for
 offenses against national security. After this period the
 individual must be brought before a magistrate, presented with
 written charges, and given legal representation.
 An omnibus Criminal Justice Act, passed by Parliament in
 November 1984 in response to growing urban crime and drug
 problems, gives some increased powers to the police in the
 area of detention for interrogation. Critics have argued that
 these provisions could diminish human rights. However, key
 provisions of the Act dealing with detention, among other
 things, cannot be put into effect under the terms of the Act
 itself until the Police Complaint Review Board has been
 established. Moreover, supporters of the bill point out that
 under the proposed law, the Irish police would have less power
 to detain and interrogate suspects than the police forces of
 other European Community states. There is no forced labor in
 Ireland.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Fair.public trial is guaranteed by the Constitution and
 respected in practice. The courts are independent, and jury
 trial is the norm. The Constitution provides for the creation
 of "special courts" to deal with cases where the "ordinary
 courts are inadequate to secure the effective administration
 of justice, and the preservation of public peace and order."
 The "Offenses Against the State Act" of 1939 formally
 established such courts and provided that they may try persons
 for offenses-against national security. These courts are used
 in response to the spillover of violence from Northern
 Ireland. Rather than having juries, these courts have panels
 of judges, each consisting of an uneven number of judges but
 never less than three. Their verdicts are by majority vote.
 Rules of evidence are similar to those of regular courts,
 except that the statement of a police chief superintendent
 that the accused is a member-of an illegal organization is
 considered evidence of such membership. Court sessions are
 usually public but may exclude certain persons, other than
 genuine press representatives. There is provision for free
 legal aid and "appeal against conviction or sentence.

 IRELAND
 There is no provision under Irish law for use of political
 offense arguments to evade prosecution or otherwise receive
 special consideration in law enforcement and judicial
 processes. Such arguments are often made by members of PIRA
 and other illegal organizations convicted of terrorist
 offenses.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Constitution protects the basic human right of
 noninterference with personal privacy, family, home, or
 correspondence which is generally observed. The Constitution,
 also provides that the State shall enact no law "providing for
 the grant of the dissolution of marriage." Arguing that
 divorce is a basic human and family right, an Irish couple, in
 late 1983, persuaded the European Court of Human Rights to
 review denial of their right to a divorce as a case of denial
 of human rights. The case is pending. In addition, the
 question is under active review in the Irish Parliament.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 These freedoms are guaranteed by the Constitution and
 generally respected in practice. The State endeavors to
 insure that organs of public opinion, while preserving liberty
 of expression (including criticism of government policy) shall
 not be used to undermine public order, morality, or the
 authority of the State. Furthermore, "publication or
 utterance of blasphemous, seditious or indecent matter" is an
 offense punishable by law.
 Ordinarily, such censorship as exists in Ireland is directed
 largely toward materials considered pornographic in nature.
 However, the state-owned radio and television networks, on the
 basis of the constitutional provisions dealing with public
 order and the authority of the State, have a longstanding
 practice of denying air time to representatives of Provisional
 Sinn Fein, the political wing of the illegal PIRA. In late
 1982, this prohibition was challenged before the Irish Supreme
 Court and upheld on constitutional grounds. All other legal
 political parties are given full and regular access to both
 public-owned radio and television facilities and major
 independent daily newspapers. Criticism of the Government in
 such media is not only allowed but flourishes.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 These freedoms are guaranteed by the Constitution and
 respected in practice. Terrorist organizations such as PIRA
 are illegal, and membership in them is an offense against
 national security. The INLA was added to the list of banned
 organizations in early 1983. Political parties or groups
 associated with-such organizations, such as Provisional Sinn
 Fein, are not proscribed.
 Labor unions have full freedom to organize independently from
 the Government and engage in free collective bargaining. The
 Irish Congress of Trade Unions, which represents unions in
 both the Republic and Northern Ireland, has 89 member unions
 with over 650,000 members. The Irish Labor Party has not had
 formal links to the trade union movement since the 1930's, but
 
 
 1016
 IRELAND
 many union officials and members play an active role in
 politics through the parties of their choice. Labor unions
 are permitted to conduct protests, including secondary and
 wildcat strikes. There are no compulsory settlement
 procedures.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Ireland is 94 percent Roman Catholic. The Constitution
 guarantees freedom to all religious groups. There are no
 restrictions on freedom of worship or association.
 Discrimination in employment, education, and other fields
 based on religious grounds has not been alleged. Some Irish
 laws, such as the prohibition against divorce, reflect the
 point of view of the majority community. The area of family
 law is the subject of much current debate in which minority
 religious communities have felt fully at liberty to take a
 vocal and active role.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 There is complete freedom of movement within the country as
 well as freedom to engage in foreign travel, emigration, and
 voluntary repatriation. Ireland has accepted displaced
 persons on a limited basis.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Ireland has had a consistent history of orderly transfer of
 power by elections since the end of the Irish Civil War in
 1923. Ireland has two major parties, three smaller parties,
 and provision for independents to stand for election to either
 house of the Irish Parliament. The constitutional requirement
 that elections be held at least every 5 years has always been
 met. Ireland uses a proportional voting system, and the
 secrecy of the ballot is fully safeguarded. The Government
 elected in November 1982 is a two-party coalition in which the
 party leader of the larger party serves as Prime Minister.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Irish Government generally cooperates with independent
 outside investigations of alleged human rights abuses.
 Amnesty International is active, as is the Irish Council for
 Civil Liberties. Both operate freely and without hindrance in
 Ireland as the principal independent organizations interested
 in domestic human rights issues. Amnesty International's 1985
 Report noted the release of Eamonn (Nicky) Kelly in 1984 (see
 last year's report) and was concerned about allegations of
 physical ill-treatment of prisoners. Freedom House rated
 Ireland "free."
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 The population of the Irish Republic in 1985 totaled about
 3,588,000 and is growing at I percent a year. Estimated per
 capita gross national product in 1983 was $5,000. Successive
 Irish governments have successfully promoted industrialization
 and diversification, raising living standards considerably.

 IRELAND
 During the last 3 years Ireland has been hurt by rising
 unemployment (17 percent in July 1985). Nonetheless, the
 people enjoy adequate shelter, nutrition, health care, and
 education. These services are available without regard to
 race, religion, sex, ethnic background, or political opinion.
 Life.expectancy at birth is 73.49 years, and the infant
 mortality rate is 9.5 per 1,000 live births. People whose
 means are inadequate and who are not entitled to other
 benefits may receive pensions or other payments from public
 funds.
 The minimum legal age for employment in Ireland is 15 years,
 and hours of employment for 15-year-olds are limited to 8
 hours per day and 40 hours per week. Persons 16 and 17 years
 of age may work up to 9 hours per day and 40 hours per week.
 No maximum number of hours per day or week applies to those
 over 18 years of age. Although there is no comprehensive law
 governing trade union activities, most terms and.conditions of
 employment are determined through collective bargaining.
 'Despite right-to-work laws, most businesses (covering over 56
 percent of the labor force) are unionized.
 There is no general minimum wage legislation in Ireland.
 However, some 50,000 workers are covered by minimum wage laws
 applicable to specific industrial sectors, mainly those which
 tend to pay lower than average wages. Four basic laws dealing
 with occupational safety provide adequate coverage. An
 extensive system of public health insurance offers health
 protection.
 In recent years women have been playing a more significant
 role in the Irish work force. Although the Constitution
 recognizes the woman's role in terms of "her life within the
 home," women have been entering the office and marketplace
 relatively smoothly but slowly. Several studies have
 highlighted the difference in pay scales between men and women
 and have drawn particular attention to the fact that in recent
 pay increases female workers have lagged considerably behind
 males, thus further widening the gap. Equal pay for equal
 work is now very much on the agenda of Ireland's small but
 growing women's movement.
