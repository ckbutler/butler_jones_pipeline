 SRI LANKA
 Sri Lanka's constitutional, multiparty form of government
 features a strong executive presidency and a unicameral
 legislature elected by universal adult suffrage. The 1980's
 saw rising tension between Sri Lanka's majority Sinhalese and
 minority Tamil populations. By 1986 government security
 forces were battling armed Tamil separatists. In July 1987,
 The Governments of Sri Lanka and India concluded a Peace
 Accord to end the conflict.
 Radicals of both major ethnic groups refused to accept the
 Accord. In the Sinhalese-majority south, government security
 forces were pitted against the revolutionary Janatha Vimukthi
 Peramuna (JVP) attempting to overthrow the Government by
 terrorist methods. in the Tamil-majority northeast, the
 Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) waged guerrilla war
 against the Indian Peace-Keeping Force (IPKF), introduced
 under the Accord, and India's Tamil militant allies.
 In 1989 the JVP stepped up its campaign against the Government
 and population at large. Likened by some observers to Pol
 Pot's Khmer Rouge and the Maoist Shining Path in Peru, the JVP
 sought to topple Sri Lanka's elected Government through a
 campaign of murder, intimidation, and strikes designed to
 paralyze civil administration, cripple the economy, and
 disrupt society. It did so despite repeated efforts by the
 Sri Lankan Government to bring the JVP into the political
 mainstream. In 1988 the Government had legalized the JVP and
 invited it to participate in the elections. The JVP responded
 by killing voters and candidates in an attempt to disrupt
 elections held in late 1988 and early 1989. In January 1989,
 in.an effort to open a dialog with the JVP, newly elected
 President Ranasinghe Premadasa released 1,800 JVP suspects and
 lifted the state of emergency. The JVP nonetheless continued
 its terror campaign of targeting hospitals, transportation,
 and other essential services, murdering union leaders who
 refused to participate in JVP-called strikes and killing the
 families of security force personnel. At mid-year, the
 GoVernment began a massive crackdown on the JVP. It detained
 several thousand JVP suspects. By the end of the year,
 security forces had captured or killed much of the JVP's top
 leadership.
 During 1989 the IPKF remained active in the northeast. Here
 Indian forces and their Tamil militant allies--particularly
 the Eelam People's Revolutionary Liberation Front
 (EPRLF)--battled the LTTE until a cease-fire went into effect
 in September. In the same month, India concluded an agreement
 with Sri Lanka for the withdrawal of the IPKF. India began
 evacuating troops late in the year. While significant numbers
 of Indian troops remained in the northeast at the end of the
 year, Indian authorities said they hoped to complete the
 Indian withdrawal by March 31, 1990. As the IPKF withdrew,
 the LTTE clashed with India's Tamil allies, as did Sri Lankan
 security forces. One week-long battle in December reportedly
 left 100 combatants and 50 civilians dead.
 Sri Lankans elected a new President in December 1988 and a new
 Parliament in February 1989. The JVP and LTTE tried to
 prevent these elections through death threats and
 assassinations, killing hundreds of voters and 14
 parliamentary candidates. As a result, turnout was low by Sri
 Lankan standards. International observers declared both
 elections largely free and fair,.given the prevailing
 conditions. The leading opposition presidential candidate,
 
 
 1562
 SRI LANKA
 however, challenged the results of the presidential election
 in court.
 Until the 1980's, Sri Lanka had-a largely ceremonial army.
 However, in response to terrorist threats and guerrilla
 insurgency, the Government has ehlisted upwards of 50,000 men
 in its army, navy, and air force. About 25,000 men serve in
 its police force, including 2,000 police commandos in the
 Special Task Force (STF). The Government also maintains a
 force of some 15,000 paramilitary home guards and is raising a
 Citizens Volunteer Force (CVF) in the northeast. The
 overwhelming majority of security force personnel are
 Sinhalese.
 About 60 percent of'Sri Lanka's productive capacity is owned
 or controlled by the Government. The rise of Tamil separatist
 and then JVP insurgencies during the 1980's damaged Sri
 Lanka's economy and crippled what many considered its high
 developmental potential. In 1989 the JVP's violent
 antigovernment campaign seriously hampered economic growth.
 Per capita gross domestic product is less than $400. Tea,
 foreign aid, garment exports, and remittances from expatriate
 Sri Lankans are leading sources of foreign exchange.
 The human rights situation deteriorated further during -1989.
 Over 9,500 persons, many of them civilians, died violently,
 the highest death toll since Sri Lanka achieved independence
 in 1948. There'were reports of human rights abuses, not only
 by radical groups such as the JVP and LTTE, but by government
 security forces, the IPKF, ind the IPKF's Tamil militant
 allies. 'Credible allegations linked the fPKF and government
 security forces to extrajudicial killings, disappearances, and
 torture.
 The rise of anti-JVP vigilante groups in the south was a
 disturbing development in 1989. The Government denied knowing
 the-identity of these vigilantes and announced an independent
 investigation into their activities. Nevertheless,
 knowledgeable observers claimed that the groups were manned at
 least in part by security force personnel operating with the
 knowledge of the-Government.
 In 1989 thousands of Sri Lankans were detained by the
 Government and--to a lesser extent--the IPKF. The Government
 acknowledged that it held 7,200 persons without charge.
 Emergency Regulations granting sweeping powers to security
 foices'enacted in late 1988 were lifted in January only to be
 reimposed at midyear in a response to increased terrorist
 activity. The Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA), which also
 grants security forces wide-ranging powers, was in effect
 thiouighout 1989.
 RESPECT FOR HURAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect-for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 - a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 Political killing' remained Sri Lanka's leading human rights
 problem. Widespread terrorist activity, ongoing military
 operations, disruption of civil administration, and government
 secrecy made collection of accurate statistics difficult.
 Moreover, as law and order deteriorated, distinguishing
 between political killings and common criminality became
 
 
 1563
 SRI LANKA
 problematic. Rough independent estimates put the number of
 political killings at over 8,500--of which perhaps 5,600 were
 civilians. The remaining 2,900 were combatants: members of
 the security forces, the IPKF, Tamil militant groups, and the
 JVP.
 More than 550 civilians died in the northeast. About 350 were
 killed during Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) clashes
 with the IPKF and the IPKF!s Tamil militant allies, in
 reprisal killings by the IPKF and its allies, and in other
 forms of political killing. The remaining 200 civilians
 represent Sinhalese and Muslim men, women, and children killed
 by Tamil militant groups. In addition, there were about 1,600
 members of all comba.ant groups killed.
 In the south, over 6,300 died as a result of political
 violence. Perhaps 5,100 were civilians. By a very rough
 estimate, more than 2,500 civilians were killed by the JVP, a
 minimum of 2,000 by vigilante groups, and over 200 by the
 security forces. The JVP killed about 500 members of the
 ruling United National Party and 400 members of the security
 forces.
 During 1989 the rise of anti-JVP vigilante groups was
 disturbing. In July the JVP threatened to kill the families
 of security force personnel, and over the next several months
 it murdered more than 50 men, women, and children related to
 members of the forces. Shortly thereafter vigilante activity
 increased markedly throughout the south. The killing fit a
 pattern: first, members of security force families were
 killed, presumably by the JVP; then, within days or sometimes
 even hours, vigilante groups would abduct JVP suspects,
 summarily execute them, and burn their bodies. Human rights
 groups alleged that some victims of vigilante killings had
 been identified as persons previously arrested by security
 forces.
 The Government denied knowledge of the identity of these
 vigilantes and declared that vigilantes would be treated like
 terrorists if they were captured. This claim of ignorance
 runs counter to strong circumstantial evidence linking the
 security forces to vigilante groups. A wide range of
 observers--human rights groups, opposition politicians,
 individual government officials, and members of the security
 forces themselves--assert that many vigilantes were security
 force personnel operating with the knowledge and acquiescence
 of the Government.
 Both the JVP and anti-JVP vigilantes were reportedly
 responsible for threatening lawyers. At least five lawyers
 were assassinated. The JVP targeted lawyers who ventured to
 defend members of the security forces accused of wrongdoing.
 At least one prominent human rights attorney left the country
 following death threats. Vigilantes targeted lawyers who
 represented persons seeking redress for human rights abuses at
 the hands of the security forces and who had filed habeas
 corpus petitions on these persons' behalf or that of their
 families. The JVP also threatened members of the news media.
 It reportedly killed the Chairman of the Sri Lanka
 Broadcasting Corporation, a well-known radio and television
 announcer, and the chief news editor of the state-run
 television corporation.
 The Government condemned threats .and attacks against lawyers,
 and ordered the establishment of an independent commission to
 
 
 1564
 SRI LANKA
 investigate vigilante groups. The Attorney General's office
 charged 10 policemen with murder in two different
 security-related cases. By the end of 1989, three had gone to
 trial. The rest awaited trial.- In 1989 the military
 court-martialed a number of servicemen for abuse of
 authority. Following a pattern set in 1983, the Government
 published no results of its inquiries into alleged security
 force human rights abuses.
 b. Disappearance
 Frequent disappearance of both Tamils and Sinhalese, usually
 young men, remained another major concern. Amnesty
 International (AI), in a May report on disappearance in Sri
 Lanka, said that it had received reports of 780 cases since
 1983--83 of them since the signing of the Indo-Sri Lankan
 Peace Accord in 1987. Of the newer cases, 49 were reported to
 have occiarred in the south at the hands of government security
 forces and 34 in the northeast by members of the IPKF and its
 Tamil allies.' The Government acknowledged that reports of
 some 800 cases of disappearance had been made. It said that
 of the 685 cases recorded before the Accord--mostly those of
 suspected Tamil militants--only a small number had been
 resolved.
 Other observers, including local human rights groups and the
 Committee of Parliamentarians for Fundamental and Human
 Rights, believe that many more disappearances in fact have
 occurrpd  since the Accord. In May, within a month of its
 formati6n, the Committee, made up of opposition members of
 Parliament, reported that it had received reports of 250
 disappearances since the Accord. Most were in the south. By
 year's end, some 3,000 cases of disappearance in the south had
 been reported. Human rights groups said they had received
 reports of more than 100 disappearances in the northeast, most
 allegedly at the hands of the IPKF. They also noted a small
 number of abductions of civilians by Tamil militant groups.
 In some of these cases, those abducted were later released; in
 others, they "disappeared." The JVP in the south also
 abducted civilians, though victims were most often found dead
 shortly after their abduction.
 In the majority of cases, according to AI, local human rights
 groups, and the Parliamentary Committee, reports qf
 disappearances were documented by family members or other
 witnesses in sworn affidavits -attestinq to the ar-rests of
 persons'who later disappeared. Often these affidavits
 described their efforts to visit arrested persons at police
 stations, military camps, or detention centers, only to be
 told by security officials that the persons seen arrested were
 not in custody.
 In some cases, fellow detainees swore that they had seen.in
 custody persons said by,.ecurity forces not to have been
 arrested. In a few cases, detainees swore that they had seen
 "disapp6ared" persons taken~away- by security forces and not
 returned pr that they saw these persons' corpses. Reports
 like these, along with the fact that the Emergency Regulations
 (ER) permit security forces to dispose of dead bodies without
 inquest, strongly suggest that some "disappeared" persons have
 been killed by the security forces, perhaps in reprisal for
 attacks on security forces and their families.
 Sri Lankan attorneys have brought some 1,300 lawsuits during
 the past 6 years--more than 400 in 1989 alone--asking the
 
 
 1565
 SRI LANKA
 Government to produce "disappeared" persons. Many of the
 earlier cases have been dropped with the Government's release
 over the last 3 years of some 5,500 Tamil and Sinhalese
 militants. Under normal circumstances, government authorities
 respond within days to such summonses. However, under the
 Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA), the delay allowed while the
 Government prepares its response is 12 months.
 The Government claimed that several factors complicated
 accounting for disappeared persons. These include false names
 given by arrested persons to conceal their identity and
 affiliation and the fact that many detainees may have left the
 country after a short detention period.
 The IPKF did not respond to lawsuits filed in Sri Lankan
 courts. In one case, a court lodged contempt proceedings
 against an IPKF officer who failed to appear in response to a
 sumoons in the case of a suspected Tamil militant allegedly
 arrested by Indian soldiers in April 1988 and subsequently
 reported to have disappeared.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 The Constitution provides that "no person shall be subjected
 to torture, cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or
 punishment." However, there were continuing reports by
 eyewitnesses, human rights organizations, members of
 Parliament, individual government officials, and members of
 the security forces that Sri Lankan security force personnel
 and the IPKF tortured and mist-reated persons in detention.
 Victims and family members have also alleged torture at the
 hands of Tamil militant groups.
 In January 1989, three police officers were charged with
 murder in the death while in police custody in September 1988
 of a lawyer and accused.JVP activist. Medical evidence showed
 that the lawyer had sustained more than 100 internal injuries
 and had died as a result of beating. By the end of the year
 the trial had not yet concluded. In March a doctor, who had
 been released after a government decision not to pursue
 charges against him, told the press he had been tortured by
 police during the first weeks of his detention. Findings of
 inquiry--if any--into these charges have not been made public.
 In its report on Sri Lanka issued in May 1989, AI stated it
 had received reports "that torture is used extensively by the
 Sri Lanka security forces, and that several people have died
 as a result of injuries incurred through torture." Local
 human rights groups and some government security officials
 acknowledge that Sri Lankan security forces commonly used
 torture to elicit information and cooperation from suspected
 members of the JVP. The ER allow confessions made to police
 officers to be used in court. Moreover, the ER place the
 burden of proof on defendants to show that a confession was
 exacted under duress.
 AI and local human rights groups also reported numerous cases
 of the IPKF torturing suspected Tamil militants. There were
 also reports that IPKF-allied Tamil groups tortured Tamil
 militants opposed to them. Local human rights groups received
 a large number of affidavits from victims stating that Indian
 soldiers beat them with rods, whipped them with electric
 cords, and subjected them to electric shock and dunkings. The
 Indian Government denies these allegations. It is unknown
 
 
 1566
 SRI LANKA
 whether the Indian Government conducted any investigations
 into these charges or took any disciplinary actions.
 A number of persons alleged in-petitions to the Supreme Court
 in 1988 and 1985 that they had been tortured. In one such
 case, heard in December 1988, the Supreme Court ordered the
 State to pay $500 compensation to a person the Court found had
 been subjected to cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment. The
 Government stated that a number of servicemen had been
 court-martialed for mistreating detainees. However, it
 provided no details of the charges, the number charged, or the
 verdict and sentences issued.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The Constitution provides that no person "shall be arrested
 except according to procedure established by law." It further
 provides that an arrested person must be informed of the
 reason for his arrest. By law, an arrested person must be
 brought within 24 hours before a magistrate who may authorize
 bail or, for serious crimes, order continued detention.
 However, criminals are frequently not informed of the reasons
 for their arrest, though they are generally produced before a
 magistrate within a few days of arrest. A suspect may be
 detained up to 3 months without bail-or longer if a court so
 rules.
 The PTA, adopted in 1979, and the ER, renewed monthly with the
 extension of the state of emergency in effect since 1983, give
 the security forces extraordinary powers in dealing with
 suspects. President Premadasa suspended the ER shortly after
 taking office in January but reimposed them in June in
 response to growing JVP terrorist activity. The PTA and ER
 permit preventive and incommunicado detention. Under the ER,
 security forces may detain a suspect for up to 3 months before
 he must be presented to a magistrate. The PTA and the ER also
 include vaguely defined acts which cin encompass nonviolent
 expression of opposition to the Government.
 Magistrates are not empowered to investigate the circumstances
 leading to a person's arrest and continued detentiori but under
 the ER "shall" remand the detainbee to a prison where he may be
 held indefinitely. A person held under the PTA may be
 detained without charge for up to 18 months. There have been
 numerous cases in which persons have been held longer. Bail
 may be-granted for persons held under the ER but, once
 charged, persons held under the PTA are ineligible for bail.
 Visits by family, access to lawyers, food, and other
 conditions of incarceration are normally restricted under
 these extraordinary laws.
 Relatives may write to the Ministry of Defense and ask that
 the case of a family member detained under the PTA be
 reviewed. The review is conducted by a three-man advisory
 board which considers the evidence, interviews the police and
 the detainee, and makes a nonbinding recommendation. Board
 reviews frequently take several months, and the authorities
 have refused ot delayed carrying out the recommendation of the
 board in some cases. By the end of the year, the board had
 reviewed the cases of approximately 1,000 suspected JVP
 members who had surrendered to the Government, freeing about
 250 and recommending the balance foriehabilitation. At the
 beginning of 1990, the board had a backlog of 5,000 cases,
 represnting.persons arrested by security forces.
 
 
 1567
 SRI LANKA
 In May the Government appointed a retired Supreme Court judge
 to head a committee monitoring the arrests, detention, and
 release of students. In September the Government stated it
 would file lists of detainees with local government officials
 and permit access to them by family members and other
 interested persons. The Government also said it would permit
 Members of Parliament to visit certain places of detention
 after prior notice to the Ministry of Defense. By year's end,
 the Government had not provided the promised full lists to
 local officials. It did, however, provide the names of
 several thousand detainees to Members of Parliament.
 Persons may challenge the legality of their detention either
 by filing a habeas corpus suit in the Courts of Appeal or by
 charging the Government before the Supreme Court with
 illegally violating fundamental rights under the Constitution.
 In early May, the Court ruled that police had violated the
 fundamental rights of two women who were twice arrested on
 suspicion of involvement with the JVP, and it awarded them
 damages. However, in many cases these provisions did not
 provide effective means of-redress to persons who allege
 arbitrary detention. The Courts of Appeal are located only in
 Colombo, which necessitates costly travel to the capital for
 those seeking redress. Fundamental rights suits must be
 filed--complete with documentation--within 30 days of the
 alleged infringement. This 30-day limit makes it virtually
 impossible in practice for persons detained incommunicado for
 prolonged periods, or relatives of those alleged to have
 disappeared, to bring such suits.
 In a peace gesture toward the JVP, President Premadasa within
 weeks of taking office in January released some 1,800 persons
 detained under the ER. However, JVP terrorist activity
 continued unabated. During the year the Government used the
 PTA and the ER to detain large numbers of JVP suspects. In
 October the Government said that it was detaining 7,200
 persons. Human rights groups believe the number may be
 higher. They also assert that in some cases family members of
 suspects are arrested and held until the suspects produce
 themselves. Human rights groups claimed that detainees were
 held not only in prisons and detention centers but also in
 military camps. The Government has, said it will grant access
 to these camps only to members of an International Committee
 of the Red Cross (ICRC) team attempting to trace missing
 persons.
 The release of Tamil militants held by the Government, begun
 after the signing of the Accord, continued. Since mid-1987,
 more than 3,800 Tamil suspects have been released. In August
 the Government announced that only 51 suspected Tamil
 militants remained in custody.
 AI and local human rights groups reported that the IPKF
 continued in 1989 to arrest and detain without.charge
 suspected Tamil militants in its camps in the northeast. In
 late September, the Commander of the IPKF said Indian troops
 .had captured 1,185 LTTE members since October 1987. Perhaps
 as many as 1,000 of these persons, as well as others
 identified as LTTE sympathizers, remain in IPKF custody. The
 IPKF has not responded to lawsuits in Sri Lankan courts filed
 to compel it to produce arrested persons. It has not stated
 on what legal basis persons are being held or specified the
 course of due legal process to be followed in their cases.
 With regard to forced or compulsory labor, see Section 6.c.
 
 
 1568
 SRI LANKA
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Substantial due process rights are accorded in nonpolitical
 cases, but trials under the PTA and ER are lacking several
 significant procedural safeguards. Persons accused of
 criminal acts are generally entitled to a fair public trial,
 are'ihformed of the charges and the evidence against them, and
 are represented by counsel of their choice. Persons tried in
 the High Court and the Court of Appeals on criminal charges
 are provided an attorney at government expense if necessary.
 The Government does not provide attorneys in other cases,
 though private legal aid organizations provide assistance to
 some defendants. Although public trial by jury is the custom,
 juries are not provided in trials under the PTA on the grounds
 that" jury members could be intimidated.
 Confessions are admissible in PTA and ER cases but not in
 nonpolitical criminal and civil cases. Those convicted under
 the PTA or the ER have the same right of appeal to the Appeals
 and Supreme Courts as those sentenced in other cases.
 However, most people held under these Acts are never formally
 charged and therefore do not enter the appeals process.
 The Sri Lankan judiciary is independent. The President
 appoints all judges of the Sri Lankan Supreme Court, Courts of
 Appeal, and High Courts. The Chief Justice and two Supreme
 Court judges comprise a Judicial Service Commission which
 appoints, transfers, and dismisses lower court judges. Judges
 serve from time of appointment to mandatory retirement age:
 65 for Supreme Court judges, 62 for others.
 In late 1988, the Government enacted legislation to create a
 special tribunal for the expeditious trial of suspected
 terrorists and subversives. The tribunal was to sit without
 jury and admit in evidence confessions and other statements
 made to any person in whatever circumstances. It would act on
 the basis of written complaints from the Inspector General of
 Police or any Deputy Inspector General. At the end of 1989,
 it was unknown whether this body had tried any cases.
 In the Northeastern Province, intimidation by Tamil militants,
 espegially the LTTE, prevented the judiciary from
 funictloning. In the south, the JVP also abridged the right to
 fair public trial by threatening judges. In at least one
 instance the JVP allegedly attacked a lawyer defending three
 police officers charged with the murder of a suspected member
 of the JVP.
 The Government brought indictments against more than 375
 persons detained under the PTA and ER in 1989. It is
 impossible to know how many of the 7,200 persons the
 Government admits are under detention, and the estimated 1,000
 persons in IPKF custody might be accurately termed political
 prisoners.'
 f.' Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Government generally respects individual privacy and the
 sanctity of the family and the home. The judiciary has a good
 record of upholding rights to priyacy in cases which reach the
 High Court. Ordinarily, search and arrest warrants are
 required to enter private premises. Under the'PTA, however,
 police officers above a certain rank and less senior officers
 authorized by them in writing may enter and search any
 
 
 1569
 SRI LANKA
 premises without a warrant and seize "any document or thing"
 when there is a presumption or evidence of support for, or
 involvement with, unlawful activity. These powers were used
 extensively in 1989.
 As in the past, IPKF soldiers operating in the northeast
 manned checkpoints, stopped vehicles, and searched homes and
 persons at the direction of officers without warrant or other
 legal sanction. In June India's Tamil allies began forcibly
 conscripting young Tamil men in the northeast to provide
 manpower for the defense of Tamil-majority areas. This force,
 "The Tamil National Army," was distinct from the Citizens
 Volunteer Force raised under the Government's Manpower
 Mobilization Act and not sanctioned by Sri Lankan law. An
 estimated 4,000 young men were forcibly conscripted. Perhaps
 another 1,000 youths fled the northeast to avoid impressment.
 An unknown number of the draftees were subsequently released
 by their abductors. Perhaps 500 were captured while fighting
 the LTTE and Sri Lankan security forces and subsequently
 released.
 In the south, the JVP used intimidation to recruit unwilling
 members and to force participation in demonstrations and other
 activities liable to subject individuals to criminal
 prosecution. University and secondary school students were
 particularly affected by JVP coercion--a development that
 contributed to campus unrest and the closure of most schools
 for much of the year. Students reportedly intimidated
 university administrators and teachers, rendering ineffective
 any schools which remained open.
 Monitoring telephones or correspondence is not known to be a
 common practice. Local politicians, journalists, and human
 rights activists have, however, alleged government wiretapping.
 g. Use of Excessive Force and Violations of Humanitarian
 Law in Internal Conflicts
 In the south, the JVP stepped up its terrorist campaign
 against the Government, killing over 2,500 civilians and
 causing great human suffering. Throughout the year, the JVP
 used death threats to compel participation in strikes which
 closed businesses and government offices. In addition, the
 strikes disrupted the distribution of food supplies and other
 key commodities. Threats against importers and consumers of
 Indian goods caused a shortage of pharmaceuticals.
 In July the JVP threatened to kill the families of security
 force personnel (see Section l.a.). In August the JVP
 targeted hospital workers in the Western Province. Threats
 against doctors, nurses, and other hospital employees--and the
 murders of at least two health practitioners--effectively shut
 down health service in the country's most populous region for
 several weeks. As a result, an estimated 100-plus persons
 died for lack of medical care.
 The Government countered the JVP's campaign with the enactment
 of a number of extraordinary laws designed to quell civil
 unrest. As part of the ER, the Government in late 1988
 broadened security force powers to dispose of dead bodies
 without inquest. It issued "shoot-on-sight" orders against
 illegal demonstrators and curfew violators. It declared
 making or posting a death threat a capital offense. These
 laws were suspended with the ER in January but reimposed with
 the ER in June.
 
 
 1570
 SRI LANKA
 Throughout the summer and into the fall, the Government waged
 an all-out campaign against the JVP, making a concerted effort
 to wipe out its leadership. By late November, most key
 leaders had been captured or killed. Two of the three most
 senior JVP leaders were killed after their capture. According
 to the Government, they were shot while trying to escape.
 In December 1988, Parliament amended the "Indemnity Act" to
 extend immunity from prosecution for acts, "legal or
 otherwise," committed by security force members, members of
 the Government, and government servants acting. "in good faith"
 to preserve public order between-August 1, 1977 and December
 16, 1988. Human rights groups have criticized the Act for its
 broad scope and its obvious potential to abridge
 constitutionally guaranteed rights. The Government invoked
 the Indemnity Act once in January, arguing that family members
 of those killed -in a 1983 communal riot at Colombo's Welikada
 Prison should not be granted compensation from the.Government
 because security forces had acted "in good faith" to quell the
 disturbance.
 There were eyewitness reports that security forces shot on
 sight persons putting up posters in July. Security force
 personnel posted their own placards threatening reprisals
 should the JVP kill their relatives.
 In July security forces confronted large-scale demonstrations
 in many parts of the south. Security force personnel,
 allegedly after being fired on from the crowds, fired back.
 Perhaps as meny as 150 persons were killed in 2 days
 throughout the south.
 In the northeast, Tamil militants reportedly murdered some 200
 unarmed Sinhalese and Muslims because they had settled on
 territory claimed as a Tamil homeland by Tamil militants. In
 addition, the LTTE apparently exacted pivilian assistance in
 the form of shelter, food, money, and assistance. Providing
 assistance to the LTTE exposed civilians to punishment by the
 IPKF.
 There were-numerous credible reports by victims and witnesses
 of indiscriminate IPKF reprisals against civilianp in the
 northeast. According to the worst-of these reports, Indian
 troops in early August attacked civilians in the northern town
 of Valvedditturai, summarily executing many. The incident
 followed an LTTE attack which left seven Indian soldiers
 dead. By the best count available, 53 men, women, and
 children were killed by Indian soldiers in the retaliation.
 The Indign Government ordered an investigation into the
 incident, but no results have been made public,
 Section 2 -Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a, - Freedom.of Speech and Press
 The Constitution provides for "freedom of speech and
 expression including publication." However, it also-permits
 these rights to be restricted "as may be prescribed by law in
 the interests of national security."
 Many newspape3s criticize the ruling party and the Government.
 However, opposition groups alleged that the ER have been used
 directly andindirectly to restrict free speech. For example,
 persons wishing to post bills advertising meetings of any type
 are required under the ER to secure police approval of the
 
 
 1571
 SRILANKA
 text. In May 1987, the Supreme Court ruled that this clause
 gave the police too broad an authority. It declared that
 police must specify a reason for denying a person permission
 to post bills. Posting of bills threatening death was made a
 capital offense in late 1988 (see Section l.g.).
 In 1989 the Government continued to prosecute individuals who
 distributed "antigovernment" literature. It also considered
 possession of JVP literature prima facie evidence of
 involvement in the organization and reason for detention under
 the ER. In September 1987, Parliament amended the
 Parliamentary Powers and Privileges Act of 1978, which permits
 Parliament to impose a fine on anyone who criticizes a member
 of Parliament. Under the 1978 Act, fines imposed were limited
 to $160. Under the 1987 amendment, Parliament was empowered
 to levy unlimited fines and imprison violators for up to 2
 years. While the amendment was not applied in 1989, human
 rights observers believe it serves as a deterrent to free
 speech.
 The Government controls the country's largest newspaper chain
 and owns the radio and television services. A variety of
 independent newspapers and journals, however, provide a full
 range of viewpoints on foreign policy and most domestic
 matters, including human rights issues. Many
 small-circulation periodicals published by opposition
 political parties operate freely.
 The Government imposed formal press censorship on press and
 other media between June 30 and July 24. Earlier, in order to
 counter JVP threats against state-owned media employees, the
 Government compelled these employees to go to work, in some
 instances forcibly conveying workers to their jobs. In July
 the Government expelled a British Broadcasting Corporation
 film crew for violating press censorship regulations.
 Some Sri Lankans assert that the Government can intimidate the
 press even without formal censorship. By threatening to take
 over private media which it claims do not operate in the
 public interest, for instance, the Government has allegedly
 prevented the media from accepting advertisements from certain
 organizations. Members of the media allege that the
 Government also exerts pressure on the press by controlling
 permits for the import of newsprint and through placement of
 considerable amounts of government announcements and
 advertising.
 The IPKF and its Tamil militant allies reportedly attempted to
 influence Jaffna-based Tamil newspapers in an effort to
 increase favorable reporting on the IPFK. According to human
 .rights groups, the IPKF-allied Eelam People* Revolutionary
 Liberation Front (EPRLF) forced the closure of the three
 independent Tamil dailies in Jaffna and abducted a number of
 their staff members. The EPRLF reportedly hoped to clear the
 field for the establishment of a new Tamil daily closely
 linked to it.
 Radicals in the northeast and south also practiced a
 particularly brutal form of censorship through intimidation
 and murder in 1989. In early May, Tamil militants killed the
 son of the editor of one of Jaffna's Tamil dailies, as well as
 the Jaffna correspondent of one of the country's-three major
 English language dailies. In the south, the JVP threatened
 and murdered several journalists:and executives of the
 state-run media (see Section l.a.). It also targeted vendors
 
 
 1572
 SRI LANKA
 and distributors of government-owned newspapers, killing
 several of them in an effort to prevent the newspapers,
 circulation in parts of the south.
 Academic freedom is generally respected by the Government.
 The JVP coerced students into boycotting classes. In some
 cases, students occupied university and secondary school
 campuses at JVP instigation. In response, the Government
 closed public universities and secondary schools in the
 south. They remained closed most of the year. Private
 schools which stayed opened received threats from the JVP and
 closed. In the north, forced conscription of teenagers led
 many parents to keep their sons at home or send them away for
 safety (see Section l.f.).
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Constitution provides for freedom of assembly and
 association. These, however, can be restricted under
 provisions of the ER and PTA. Sri Lanka has numerous private
 associations, which are free to maintain ties with
 international bodies.
 Under the ER, the President (or his designee) may prohibit
 public meetings "likely to cause a disturbance to public order
 and promote disaffection." In practice, the police issue or
 deny permits at the discretion of the Superintendent of Police
 in each area for outdoor public meetings or processions.
 There was no evidence in 1989 that. permits to hold public
 meetings were denied to the legal opposition. In Noyember
 198&, the Government ordered_its security forces to shoot on
 sight illegal antigovernment demonstrators (see Section l.g.).
 Antigovernment militants were the greatest threat to..Sri
 Lankans' freedom of assembly. JVP members attacked UNP and
 other political party meetings in the period before the
 Februaty 15 parliamentary elections, killing hundreds of
 voters and keeping many thousands from the polls..
 For a discussion of freedom of association as it applies to
 labolr unipins, see Section 6.a.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 The Constitution establishes Buddhism as the official religion
 and requires the Government "to protect and foster" Buddhism.
 It also guarantees the rights of all others, including Hindus,
 Muslims, and- Chngtians, to practice their religions freely.
 Complaints in the past that-.Buddhists had an advantage over
 members of other religions in winning senior government
 positions are now heard less frequently. Members of all
 religious groups hold influential positions in the Government
 and in major political parties.
 Religious groups hre free to maintain active ties with
 coreligionists in other countries, and many Sri Lankans
 perform religious travel each year. Religious publishing and
 proselytizing are freely allowed, and foreign clergy may work
 in Sri Lanka.
 d. Freedomnof Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 T rav~4,Emigration, and Repatriation:
 The Constitution-grants every citizen "freedom of movement and
 of choosing his residence within Sri Lanka" and "freedom to
 
 
 1573
 SRI LANKA
 return to Sri Lanka." These constitutional provisions are
 generally honored.
 However, believing that Tamil militants were frequently
 crossing from southern India to northern Sri Lanka via the
 Palk Strait, the Government adopted a series of measures,
 beginning in 1984, which progressively restricted free
 movement in the north. Maritime surveillance and prohibited
 zones significantly restricted free movement and made it
 almost impossible for resident fishermen to ply their trade.
 These restrictions were strengthened significantly by the IPKF
 in the northeast but were not enforced consistently during
 1989.
 Movement in the northeast and the south was also restricted by
 curfews imposed by the Government, as well as by "strikes"
 ordered by the JVP and enforced through threats and
 assassination. Southern districts were under night curfew
 from late July through October as the Government attempted to
 end terrorist incidents and capture or kill the JVP's
 leadership.
 Sri Lanka generally denies entry to refugees or displaced
 persons from other countries. The Government does not help
 refugees who attempt to stay in the country while seeking
 permanent residence elsewhere.
 There was an unknown number of internally displaced persons in
 Sri Lanka at the end of the year. Most lived with relatives
 or friends. The Government estimated that some 134,000 Sri
 Lankan Tamil refugees left the island for southern India
 during the 4 years of fighting prior to the Accord. In late
 April, it said that about 40,000 of these persons had returned
 to Sri Lanka, many with the help of the United Nations High
 Commissioner for Refugees and the Governments of India and Sri
 Lanka. Another 12,000 refugees are known to have returned
 without assistance. Refugee officials estimated that fewer
 than 5,000 Sri Lankan Tamil refugees remained in camps in
 southern India. The remaining 90,000 persons are believed
 still in southern India, living and working in the local
 economy. In addition, as many as 60,000 Sri Lankan Tamils
 have sought refuge in Western Europe and North America.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Citizens have the constitutional right to change their
 government through periodic, multiparty elections. There is
 universal adult suffrage, and voter turnout is high (usually
 around 80 percent).
 In December 1988, Sri Lankan voters elected then-Prime
 Minister Ranasinghe Premadasa of the United National Party
 (UNP) as President with 50.4 percent of the popular vote. He
 succeeded his UNP colleague, J. R. Jayewardene. In February
 1989, the UNP won 50.7 percent of the popular vote and 125 of
 225 seats in the nation's first parliamentary elections in 12
 years.
 Both elections were marked by high levels of violence
 instigated by the LTTE in the northeast and the JVP in the
 south. Both organizations attempted through intimidation and
 murder to halt the elections and prevent citizens from
 voting. In the first 6 weeks of-the year, the JVP killed 14
 parliamentary candidates. During the week of the
 
 
 1574
 SRI LANKA
 parliamentary elections, the LTTE and the JVP murdered perhaps
 225 persons, many of them at polling stations or on their way
 to and from voting. Despite these difficulties, 55 percent of
 the electorate turned out for the presidential election and 64
 percent for parliamentary polls.
 The Government invited international observer teams for both
 elections. The teams found both elections generally free and
 fair, given the prevailing conditions. However, the leading
 opposition presidential candidate challenged the results of
 the presidential election in a petition to the Supreme Court.
 She alleged that the prevailing violence, as well as
 government-sponsored coercion and vote fraud, unfairly
 influenced the outcome. Her case was still pending at the end
 of 1989.
 Although members of each ethnic community can be found in many
 of the political parties, the most influential political
 parties generally araw their support from one ethnic
 community. The UNP and the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP),
 dominant in the Sinhalese electorate, historically have
 alternated rule. T]at pattern changed in 1982, when,
 following the victory of UNP incumbent President Jayewardene,
 the Government held a referendum to extend the life of the
 1977 PArliament by 6 years. Restrictions were imposed on the
 activities of opposition political parties during the
 referendum campaign. Numerous voting irregularities were
 reported-by the elections commissioner. - The extension was
 approved by 54.5 percent of the voters.
 In 1988 "and 1989, several formerly militant Tamil groups that
 had Accepted the Accord emerged as representative political
 parties in the northeast. They effectively replaced the Tamil
 United Liberation Front, which until 1988 had claimed to speak
 for the Ceylon Tamils, for centuries the majority population
 in the northeast. The political wing of the Eelam
 Revolutionary Organization~of Students (EROS), the Eelavar
 Democratic Front (EDF), won 13 seats in Parliament to-become
 the third largest party in Parliament and the largest
 parliamentary -party in.the northeast.
 Indian Tamils-, who. make up about one-third of the country's
 Tamil population, live primarily in the central hill country
 And have been only minimally involved in the ethnic conflict.
 They are represented by the Ceylon. Workers Congress (CWC),
 which is also a trade union. The CWC is allied to thp ruling
 UNP.
 Opposition parties function freely. Several operdte their own
 newspapers. The JVP was granted legal status a*/a political
 party in May 1988. This ended an official proscription of the
 party imposed in 1983. The Government repeatedly invited the
 JVP to discuss its differences at the conference table and
 often appealed to-,the group to :forswear violence and join the
 democratic process. The JVP responded to none of these
 appeals land continued its violent terrorist activity. In
 September the,<Government called for an all-party-congress to
 deal with the country's political difficulties. The JVP
 refused to take part.

 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government is sensitive to criticism of human rights in
 Sri Lanka. Senior government officials have made themselves
 available to visitors looking into human rights issues. In
 October, 6 years after the ICRC had first offered its services
 to the Sri Lankan Government, the Government invited an ICRC
 team to visit Sri Lanka to extend humanitarian services. In
 November the team began visiting places of detention to
 interview JVP suspects. In the north, however, the IPKF
 reportedly denied the ICRC access to prisoners held by Indian
 troops. The Government continues to respond to questions on
 human rights practices put by the United Nations Human Rights
 Commission.
 In its May 1989 report, covering 1988 and early 1989, AI noted
 that it had last visited Sri Lanka in 1982 and that numerous
 requests, the latest in January 1989, to the Government to
 permit another visit had gone unanswered. The Government says
 that it draws a distinction between "impartial" international
 organizations such as the ICRC and private groups such as AI.
 The Government has further said that it does not plan to
 invite AI to the country.
 Several local nongovernmental organizations monitor human
 rights, including the Civil Rights Movement and the Movement
 for Interracial Justice and Equality. They collect
 information from families of victims or members of citizens'
 committees near the site of alleged incidents. The Government
 generally does not address their periodic reports and
 appeals. A new human rights organization, the
 Parliamentarians for Fundamental and Human Rights, with
 membership drawn from the ranks of the country's 100
 opposition members of Parliament, was formed in 1989. It has
 invited ruling party parliamentarians to join it and
 participate in'its activities.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Under British colonial administration prior to 1948, Ceylon
 Tamils held a larger percentage of influential positions in
 government service, the police, the professions, and commerce
 than the percentage of Tamils overall in the population. With
 independence, Sinhalese political leaders sought to redress
 what they regarded as an imbalance in favor of Ceylon Tamils.
 Typical of their efforts was the "Sinhala-Only" Act of 1956
 which made Sinhala the sole official language of the country.
 Many Tamils considered the Act discriminatory, claiming that
 it granted native Sinhala speakers unfair advantage in
 education and in the workplace.
 In the 1978 Constitution, Tamil was designated a "national"
 language and its use in government, education, and the courts
 was specifically protected. Nevertheless, Tamils have charged
 that this legal proteption is not enforced. Tamils complain
 that they suffer from systematic discrimination in competition
 for university entrance, employment opportunities, and other
 matters under government control. Government officials have
 denied these charges. They point out that prominent Tamils
 occupy senior-level civil service positions. Many of these
 Tamils are approaching retirement age, however, and there are
 few Tamils in the lower ranks of the civil service and
 
 
 1576
 SRI LANKA
 military to takefthpirplaces. Under the Constitution's 13th
 Amendment, enacted in! -ovember 1988 to implement the terms of
 the Indo-Sri Lange'Accord, Tamil and Sinhalese were made
 co-official languages and English the "link" language.
 However, one observer estimates that 98 percent of the schools
 are-segregated by language.
 Indian Tamils, descendants of Tamils brought from India in the
 19th century to work on plantations, have suffered particular
 discrimination. No longer qualifying for citizenship under
 Indian law, they were also denied Sri Lankan citizenship by
 laws adopted after independence. Since then, the Sri Lankan
 and Indian Governments have reached several agreements aimed
 at resolving the problem of these stateless Tamils. Under a
 1986 agreement, the Sri Lankan Government agreed to grant
 citizenship to all remaining stateless Tamils. In November
 1988, the Government eliminated processing delays by passing a
 law making extension of citizenship to these stateless persons
 automatic upon simple request. The new legislation did not
 cover some 94,000 Tamils who themselves or whose parents once
 applied for Indian citizenship but who now wish to stay in Sri
 Lanka. These will be compelled to leave Sri Lanka, presumably
 for India. None, however, were forced to leave in 1989.
 The Government established a commission for the elimination of
 discrimination and the monitoring of fundamental rights late
 in 1986.- Charged with investigating individual complaints on
 the basis'of race, religion, language, caste, sex, political
 opinion, or place of birth, the commission resolved 1,379
 complaints, some with many grievants, in the first 9 months of
 1989. -Many of these complaints were related to the workplace.
 Sri Lankan women'have equal rights under the law, including
 equal property and inheritance rights. However, various
 ethnic and religious groups have their own strictures which
 place limitations on women. Some Tamil families believe their
 women members should not be seen working in public. Some
 Muslim women are discouraged by members of their community
 from seeking higher education or employment. Women do fill
 important posts in the civil service, the professions, and
 business, but most are found either in manual and semiskilled
 jobs or in the home. In 1985, the last year for which figures
 are available, women employed in agricultural work were paid
 on average 71 percent of the hourly wage received by men.
 Violence against women is known to occur in Sri Lanka, but
 little is known about-its extent.- There are no official
 statistics on the subject. Abuse within the family is seldom
 reported or discussed publicly owing to the respect accorded
 persoAal privacy. Perpetrators of violence against women may
 be yprosecuted under the criminal code, but many women are
 reluctant to pursue charges agaiAst family members. There are
 infrequent reports of rape, wife beating and murder of wives
 by husbands.
 SectiOn" 6: Worker*Rights
 a..The Right of Association
 The Constitution providde for freedom of assembly and
 association-and-the right to form and join trade unions. Any
 seven wofkdrs amy form 'a union, draw up their own procedures,
 elect'their ownlrepresentatives, and formulate'programs.
 Warker righte, including the right to choose iepresentatives,
 publicize 6views, and determine 'programs, are protected by
 
 
 1577
 SRI LANKA
 law. Unions are free to affiliate internationally, and
 different Sri Lankan trade union federations are affiliates of
 all three major international trade union organizations.
 Public servants have no right to strike and are not provided
 arbitration machinery. Aggrieved public servants may appeal
 to a Public Service Commission for relief. However, union
 activists and labor lawyers claim that the Commission is
 biased against employees. Other-workers are free to strike
 and have done so frequently. Under the Essential Services
 Act, the President may declare any business to be an essential
 service, making a strike illegal. President Premadasa used
 this power extensively during the year to counter the violent
 efforts of the JVP to cripple essential services and overthrow
 the Government. The JVP targeted union leaders, especially
 those of government-affiliated unions, murdering more than 200
 of them since 1987 in its effort to enforce involuntary
 strikes.
 About 1,000 labor unions and federations together represent
 about one-third of-the 5.5 million-strong labor force.
 Although there are a few independent unions, most large worker
 organizations are affiliated with political parties and play a
 significant role in the political process.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 Workers are expressly granted the right to bargain
 collectively by formation of workers' councils to promote a
 voluntary worker-employer dialog. Workers who believe that
 this right has been abridged may lodge complaints with the
 Commissioner of Labor, the Labor Tribunal, or the Supreme
 Court. Department of Labor officers may arbitrate when
 workers and employers are not able to resolve a dispute.
 These officers are stationed throughout the country to assure
 that employers fulfill their legal and contractual obligations
 to workers and to be available for mediation in minor local
 disputes. A 1989 report by an International Labor
 Organization (ILO) Committee of Experts (COE) called- on the
 Government to provide information on measures taken to
 guarantee adequate protection against antiunion discrimination.
 Workers in the nonplantation agricultural sector and most of
 those employed in small businesses, as well as workers in the
 free trade zones, are not represented by unions. Unionization
 in the zones is not prohibited by law but is, according to
 employers and union leaders, discouraged in practice by
 employers and the Government, the latter by restricting access
 to the zones by union organizers. Zone employees participate
 in labor-management company associations. Workers in the
 unorganized agricultural sector are not covered by labor laws,
 although the Government may investigate individual complaints.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 While not prohibited by law, there is no forced labor in Sri
 Lanka. As noted in Section l.f., India's Tamil militant
 allies have forcibly conscripted young Tamil men in the
 northeast to provide manpower for the defense of
 Tamil-majority areas.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 Employment of children under age. 12 is prohibited. Those
 between ages 12 and 14 are called child workers and may not be
 
 
 1578
 SRI LANKA
 employed in industry or dangerous occupations. Employment of
 young persons between 15 and 18 is subject to certain
 restrictions. Employees under age 18 cannot be required to
 work outside specified hours. -In addition, employers are
 required to provide young workers with annual leave, rest
 periods, and meal breaks similar to those provided to adult
 workers. There is no compulsory education law.
 In practice, however, there is a work force of children,
 probably numbering at least several thousand, who work
 illegally, mostly at jobs in rice cultivation, -as domestics,
 or as street peddlers. Efforts to address this problem have
 been hampered by the fact that in some cases child workers are
 a major source of family income.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 There is no national minimum wage, but wage boards for 37
 different trades set minimum wages and working conditions.
 For example, the minimum wage for nurses, bus drivers, and
 garment workers is about $25 per month. Actual wages and
 working conditions generally exceed these minimums, which many
 union leaders consider insufficient for'maintaining a decent
 standard of living. A 1989 report by the ILO's COE called on
 the Government to maintain its miniumum wage machinery in
 operation. Several Sri Lankan unions had filed a complaint
 under ILO Convention 131 that a motion of the Wage Board for
 an increase in the cost of living for plantation workers was
 denied by the Government until export conditions and internal
 conditions stabilized. Most permanent full-time workers are
 covered by laws which provide that they shall work no more
 than 45 hours per week and that they will receive a 14-day
 paid annual holiday.
 Minimum conditions for the protection of the safety and health
 of workers-areset forth in legislation passed by Parliament
 and "implemented by.the Department -of Labor, which employs a
 small staff of ergineers' -nd, inspectors for this purpose.
 Fines up't&'$15U may~be levied on employers who fail to meet
 minimum standards. - The Department of Labor educates workers
 about minimumstandards for-differeit workplaces -and  -
 encourages.the use of safety equipment such as earplugs and
 safety guards. Union leaders allege that' government
 enforcement of health and safety standards is poor.--
