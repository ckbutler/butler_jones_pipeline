 MALI
 Mal is a constitutional democracy. The Government is headed by Prime Minister
 Thrahim Boubacar Keita. In the country's first democratic elections in 1992, which
 were judged to-be free and fair by international observers, citizens ratified a new
 constitution, eleted the National Asembly, and chose President Alpha Oumar
 Konare as Head of State. These elections completed a 14-month transition following
 the 1991 overthrow of the Moussa Traore regime. The peace agreement reached
 with Tuareg and Maur rebel rups in 1995 remained in force. At a ceremony in
 March, the lovernment officially celebrated the end of the rebellion, and the major-
 ity of rebel movements formally dissolved themselves.
 Security forces are composed of the army, air force, Gendarmerie, the National
 Guard, and the police. The army and air force are under the control of the civilian
 Minister of Defense,   are the Gendarmerie and the National Guard. The police
 are under the Ministry of Territorial Administration. The police and gendarmes
 share responsibility for internal security.
 
 
 Mali is a very poor country. Its economy is based primarily on farming and ani-
 mal husbandry, making it highly dependent on adequate rainfall for its economic
 well-being. The Government continues to make progress in implementing reforms
 aimed at modernizing the economy. Nevertheless, Mali continues to be beset by eco-
 nomic problems, including a poor infrastructure, the lack of an industrial sector, and
 heavy dependence on foreign assistance. Social ills, including a literacy rate of only
 23 percent and a high population growth rate, also contribute to Mali's poverty.
 The Government generally respected constitutional provisions for freedom of
 speech, press, assembly, association, and religion. However, prison conditions are
 poor, and the judicial system's large case backlog results in long periods of pretrial
 detention. The executive branch retains influence over the judiciary. Social and cul-
 tural factors continued to sharply limit economic and educational opportunities for
 most women. Societal violence against women and children, including spousal abuse
 and female genital mutilation, is widespread.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial KIiling.-There were no reports of political or
 other extrajudicial killings.
 There were no developments in the October 1994 deaths of the Swiss Cooperation
 Mission director and his two Malian colleagues, who were killed by an army patrol
 in Niafunke. A Government mission of inquiry into their deaths determined in De-
 cember 1994 that the patrol's actions were unwarranted and unjustified. However,
 to date, the Government has neither identified publicly the responsible parties, nor
 made attempts to expedite the case, which remains on file at the regional court in
 Mopti.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution prohibits such practices, and there were no reports that officials
 employed them.
 Prison conditions continue to be characterized by overcrowding, inadequate medi-
 cal facilities, and limited food supplies. They remain below minimum international
 standards. Several organizations, including the Malian Association of Human
 Rights, and the Malian Association of Women Jurists, visited prisoners in 1996 and
 are working with women and juvenile prisoners to improve their conditions. The
 International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) continued to visit detainees held
 in connection with the tensions in the north, as well as the leading members of the
 former government. In Bamako juvenile offenders are usually held in the same pris-
 on as adult offenders but are kept in separate cells. Women are housed in the same
 prison facility as men but live in a separate compound. In regional prisons outside
 the capital, men and women are housed in the same building but in separate cells.
 In these facilities, children share cells with adult prisoners of the same sex.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution provides that suspects
 must be charged or released within 48 hours and are entitled to counsel. In practice,
 however, detainees are not always charged within the 48-hour period. Moreover, ad-
 ministrative backlogs and insufficient lawyers, judges, and courts often cause
 lengthy delays in bringing people to trial. In extreme cases, individuals have re-
 mamed several years in prison before coming to trial. Judicial warrants are required
 for arrest. Local lawyers have estimated that about half of prison inmates are pre-
 trial detainees. Bail does not exist. On occasion the authorities release defendants
 on their own recognizance.
 The Government does not practice forced exile.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution provides for an independent judi-
 ciary, but the executive branch continues to exert considerable influence over the
 judicial system. The Ministry of Justice appoints judges and supervises both law en-
 forcement and judicial functions, and the President heads the Superior Judicial
 Council, which oversees judicial activity.
 The Supreme Court has both judicial and administrative powers. The Constitution
 established a separate Constitutional Court which oversees issues of constitutional-
 ity and acts as an election arbiter. The Constitution also provides for the convening
 of a High Court of Justice with the power to try senior government officials in cases
 of treason.
 Except in the case of minors, trials are public, and defendants have the right to
 be present and have an attorney of their choice. Defendants are presumed innocent
 and have the right to confront witnesses and to appeal decisions to the Supreme
 Court. Court-appointed attorneys are provided for the indigent without charge. The
 majority of disputes in rural areas are decided by the village chief in consultation
 
 
 170
 with the elders. If these decisions are challenged in court, only those found to have
 legal merit are upheld.
 Women and minorities are not discriminated against in courts, but traditional
 practice discriminates against women in inheritance matters.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution provides for the inviolability of the home, and the Government respects
 this right in practice. Police searches are infrequent and require judicial warrants.
 Security forces do, however, maintain physical and technical surveillance of individ-
 uals and groups believed to be threats to internal security, including surveillance
 of telephone and written correspondence of individuals deemed to be a threat to na-
 tional security.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech
 and the press, and the Government respects these rights in practice. There are ap-
 proximately 40 independent newspapers and journals, in French, Arabic, and local
 languages. There are three daily newspapers: two are independent; one is govern-
 ment controlled.
 The Government controls one television station and one of many radio stations,
 but all operate on a semi-independent basis and present a wide range of views, in-
 cluding those critical of the Government, the President, the Prime Minister, and
 other politicians.
 Fifteen independent radio stations exist in Bamako, and there are approximately
 40 additional stations throughout the country. Two private television companies re-
 broadcast French, British, South African, and American television programs, includ-
 ing news bulletins. The Government made little progress toward private television
 licensing during the year.
 Laws passed in 1993 regulate the press and provide for substantial penalties, in-
 cluding imprisonment, for slander and for public injury to the Head of State, other
 officials, and foreign diplomats; these laws leave injury undefined and subject to ju-
 dicial interpretation.
 Academic freedom is respected.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 these rights, and the Government respects them in practice. The Government does
 not interfere with political meetings, which take place openly.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of religion and de-
 clares Mali to be a secular state. The Government does not discriminate on religious
 grounds, and citizens are free to practice their faiths. Although legal restrictions on
 the Baha'i faith still exist, the Government does not enforce them, and Baha'i wor-
 ship freely. The Minister of Territorial Administration can prohibit religious publi-
 cations that he concludes defame another religion, but there were no known in-
 stances of publications being prohibited.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Constitution provides for these rights, and the Government gen-
 erally respects them in practice. The Government generally does not restrict inter-
 nal movement, and does not restrict international travel. However, police routinely
 stop and check both citizens and foreigners to restrict the movement of contraband
 and to verify vehicle registrations. Some police and gendarmes use the occasion to
 extort bribes.
 The Government cooperates with the Office of the United Nations High Commis-
 sioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and other humanitarian organizations in assisting ref-
 ugees. Although Mali has no legislation regarding refugee asylum and resettlement,
 the Government, in practice, provides first asylum for refugees. Those granted refu-
 gee status by the UNHCR are permitted to remain, albeit in a legal vacuum due
 to the absence of resettlement legislation. There were no reports of forced return
 of persns to a country where they feared persecution.
 Of the estimated 120,000 Taureg and Maur Malian refugees who fled to neighbor-
 ing countries during the 1990-95 Taureg-Maur rebellion, approximately 87,000 re-
 main in neighboring countries. In July the UNHCR appealed to the international
 community to fund its program for repatriating the remaining Malian refugees.
 With the consolidation of peace in northern Mali, both UNHCR-assisted and sponta-
 neous refugee repatriations continued throughout the year. The Government asserts
 that there are approximately 16,700 Mauritanian Peuhl refugees residing in Mali.
 Some expatriates who work in the development and refugee fields believe that the
 figure is lower.
 
 
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens have the right to change their government and did so for the first time
 in 1992, voting by secret ballot in elections that were generally free, fair, and broad
 based, despite some irregularities. Twenty-one political parties participated in the
 elections, and 11 are represented in the National Assembly. The President's party,
 the Association for Democracy in Mali, holds the majority of the seats in the Assem-
 bUnder the Constitution, the President is Chief of State and Commander-in-Chief
 of the armed forces and is elected for a term of 5 years with a limit of two terms.
 The President appoints the Prime Minister.
 There are no restrictions on voting, legal or otherwise, for women or minorities.
 However, women are underrepresented in politics. Only 3 women hold seats in the
 116-member National Assembly, and 2 cabinet ministers are women. A third
 woman, the Secretary for the Promotion of Women, holds ministerial rank. Nomadic
 peoples, including Fulani and Taureg, are represented in both the Cabinet and Na-
 tional Assembly. The President of the Assembly is Fulani.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Independent human rights organizations-including the Malian Association for
 Human Rights (AMDH), a smaller Malian League of Human Rights, and a local
 chapter of Amnesty International--operate openly and without interference from the
 Government. Since 1994 the Government has held an annual democratic forum in
 December to which it invited citizens to voice discontent and grievances against the
 Government publicly in the presence of international human rights observers. The
 events are well attended by local citizens from all walks of life who speak freely.
 International media and human rights observers were present at the forum. The
 ICRC has an office in Bamako and has strengthened its presence in the north by
 opening offices in Timbuktu and Gao.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution prohibits discrimination based on social origin, color, language,
 sex, or race, and the Government respects these provisions in practice. However, so-
 cial and cultural factors give men a dominant role.
 Women.-Although the Constitution prohibits discrimination based on sex and
 provides for the basic rights of all persons, violence against women, including wife
 beating, is tolerated and common.
 Women's access to jobs in the professions and government is limited, as are their
 economic and educational opportunities. For example, a 1995-96 national demo-
 graphic and health survey found that 81 percent of women between the ages of 15
 and 49 received no education (compared with 69.3 percent of men). Women comprise
 15 percent of the labor force. The Government, the major employer, pays women the
 same as men for similar work. Women often live under harsh conditions, especially
 in the rural areas, where they perform hard farm work and do most of the
 childrearing. Despite legislation giving women equal rights regarding property, tra-
 ditional practice and ignorance of the law prevent women from taking full advan-
 tage of this reform. In March the Government launched a 4-year national plan of
 action for the promotion of women. The plan, financed by national, regional, and
 local community budgets, seeks to reduce inequalities between men and women in
 six target areas, including education, health, and legal rights.
 There are numerous active women's groups that promote the rights of women and
 children, and the female head of the Commission for the Promotion of Women en-
 joys the rank of minister. Women have very limited access to legal services. They
 are particularly vulnerable in cases of divorce, child custody, and inheritance rights,
 as well as in the general protection of civil rights.
 Children.-Only one in five children receives basic education. There is no con-
 stitutional or legal provision to protect the interests and rights of children, and no
 juvenile court system. However, the Malian Social Services Department investigates
 and intervenes in cases of reported child abuse or neglect.
 Female genital mutilation (FGM), which is widely condemned by international
 health experts as damaging to both physical and psychological health, is still com-
 mon, especially in rural areas, and is performed on girls at an early age. According
 to the 1995-96 national demographic and health survey, at least 93.7 percent of
 women have undergone this mutilation. The Government has not proposed legisla-
 tion prohibiting FGM. However, it supports educational efforts to eliminate the
 
 
 practice through seminars and conferences and provides media access to proponents
 of its elimination.
 People With Disabilities.-There is no specific legislation protecting the rights of
 the physically or mentally disabled, nor mandating accessibility. The Government
 does not discriminate against the physically disabled in regard to employment, edu-
 cation, and other state services. Given the high unemployment rate, however, the
 physically disabled are often unable to find work.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution and the Labor Code specifically
 provide for the freedom of workers to form or join unions and protect freedom of
 association. Only the military, the Gendarmerie, and the National Guard are ex-
 cluded from forming unions. Virtually all salaried employees are organized. Workers
 have established independent unions for teachers, magistrates, health workers, and
 senior civil servants, and most are affiliated with the National Union of Malian
 workers (UNTM) confederation. The UNTM has maintained its autonomy from the
 Government.
 The Constitution provides for the right to strike, although there are restrictions
 in some areas. For example, civil servants and workers in state-owned enterprises
 must give 2 weeks' notice of a planned strike and must enter into negotiations with
 the employer and a third party, usually the Ministry of Labor. The Labor Code pro-
 hibits retribution against strikers, and the Government respects this requirement
 in practice. Workers at the privately owned Syama gold mine in Sikasso region went
 on strike in January and March to demand a pay increase and a reduction in work-
 ing hours. In June, 6 of the 12 UNTM unions staged a legal 2-day walkout to sup-
 port demands for increased wages.
 Unions are free to associate with and participate in international bodies.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The growth of independent
 unions has led to more direct bargaining between these unions and their employers.
 Wages and salaries, however, for those workers belonging to the UNTM unions are
 setby tripartite negotiations between the Ministry of Labor, labor unions, and rep-
 resentatives of the ederation of employers of the sector to which the wages apply.
 These negotiations usually set the pattern for unions outside the UNTM. The Min-
 istry of Labor acts as a mediator in abor disputes.
 N either the Constitution nor the Labor Code addresses the question of antiunion
 discrimination, but there have been no reports or complaints of antiunion behavior
 or activities. If the parties cannot come to agreement, the dispute goes to the Labor
 Court for decision.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Constitution prohibits forced
 or compulsory labor. Slavery persists, however, throughout the North. Expatriate
 health, development, and refugee workers report that traditional enslavement of
 members of the Bellah ethmc group by Taureg factions remains widespread
 throughout the North. Rumors persist of slavery in the remote salt mining commu-
 nities of Taoudeni north of Timbuktu. These rumors are difficult to verify, and other
 reports indicate that the members of the Bellah ethnic group who work the mines
 now receive wages, however meager.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The minimum legal age for em-
 ployment is 14 years, but children may work with parental permission as appren-
 tices at the age of 12. This regulation is often ignored in practice. Moreover, it has
 no effect on the vast number of children who work in ruralareas, helping with fam-
 ily farms and herds, and in the informal sector, e.g., street vending. These children
 are not protected by laws against unjust compensation, excessive hours, or capri-
 cious discharge. The Labor.Inspection Service of the Ministry of Labor is responsible
 for, and reasonably effective in, enforcement of child labor laws, but only in the
 modern sector.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The Labor Code specifies conditions of employ-
 ment, including hours, wages, and social security, but in practice many employers
 either ignore or do not comply completely with the regulations. The national mini-
 mum wage rate, set in October 1994, is approximately $40 (cfa 21,000) per month.
 Workers must be paid overtime for additional hours. The minimum wage is supple-
 mented by a required package of benefits, including social security and health care.
 While this total package could provide a minimum standard of living for one person,
 in practice most wage earners supprt large extended families and must supplement
 their income by some subsistence farming or work in the informal sector.
 The normal legal workweek is 40 hours, with a requirement for at least one 24-
 hour rest period.Tlhe Social Security Code provides a broad range of legal protection
 against hazards in the workplace, and workers' groups have brought pressure on
 
 
 employers to respect parts of the regulations, particularly those affecting personal
 hygiene. With unemployment high, however, workers are often reluctant to report
 vilations of occupational safety regulations. The Labor Inspection Service of the
 Ministry of Labor oversees these standards but limits enforcement to the modem,
 formal sector. Workers have the right to remove themselves from dangerous work
 situations and request an investigation by the Social Security Department, which
 is responsible for recommending remedial action where deemed necessary.
