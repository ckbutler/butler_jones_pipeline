 JAPAN
 Japan is a parliamentary democracy in which democratic
 institutions are well established. Human rights are
 guaranteed by the Japanese constitution and secured by
 a just and efficient legal system. In 1979, Japan completed
 ratification of the international covenants on civil
 and political rights, and on economic, social and cultural
 rights.
 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 There are no known instances of torture committed in
 Japan.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Freedom from cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or
 punishment is guaranteed by law and respected in prac-
 tice.
 c. Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 Freedom from arbitrary arrest or imprisonment is guaran-
 teed by law and respected in practice. Individuals
 cannot be arrested without charge and prosecuting autho-
 rities must be prepared to demonstrate that sufficient
 evidence exists to detain the accused before trial.
 There are no allegations of "political prisoners"
 held in Japan.
 d. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The right to a fair public trial is guaranteed by law
 and respected in practice. The accused are made aware
 of charges against them, are guaranteed a public trial
 by independent, civilian courts with defense counsel
 and the right to cross examination. Defense counsel
 have free and private access to defendants without
 harassment by government authorities, and have the
 right of access to evidence before trial, after a
 formal indictment has been made. Defendants are also
 protected from self-incrimination and the application
 of ex-post-facto laws.

 e. Invasion of the Home
 We do not know of any cases in Japan in which
 authorities have entered homes without first obtaining
 a legal warrant, and the standards for issuing such
 warrants are adequate to guard against arbitrary
 searches.
 2.   Governmental Policies Relating to the Fulfillment
 of Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care
 and Education:
 Basic human needs in Japan are provided for primarily
 by the social infrastructure that has grown apace with
 Japan's free industrialized economy. Food shelter, health
 care, and education are available widely in good quality,
 with the government generally acting as the provider
 of last resort for the needy. Welfare standards
 are maintained more by the efforts of the private sector
 than by explicit government policy, for the Japanese
 employer traditionally assumes a paternal responsibility
 for the welfare of employees and their families.
 Japan's distribution of income is among the most eqali-
 tarian in the world according to United Nations studies.
 Ownership of private property is widespread and pro-
 tected by law.
 3.   Respect for Civil and Political Liberties,
 Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and
 Assembly
 These freedoms are guaranteed by law and respected
 in practice.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country,
 Foreign Travel and Emigration
 Citizens have the right to change their place of
 residence, to travel freely, both within Japan and
 abroad, and to emigrate.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political
 Process
 All adult citizens share the right to vote, and this
 right is enjoyed in practice. Vote is by secret
 ballot. Political interest groups can organize
 and engage in non-violent political activity regard-
 less of their political hue. Six opposition parties
 are active, ranging from a communist party to a moderate
 conservative party. Elections are completely honest
 and open, and they accurately reflect the public will.
 Labor unions are well organized and play an essential
 role in bringing workers into the political process.
 Unions are granted by law the right to organize, strike,
 bargain collectively, and lobby, with important restric-
 tions defined by law on these rights vis-a-vis members-
 of the armed forces, police and public employees.
 4. Government Attitude and Record Regarding International
 and Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Viola-
 tions of Human Rights
 The Department of State knows of no requests of any
 organizations to investigate human rights conditions in
 Japan.
