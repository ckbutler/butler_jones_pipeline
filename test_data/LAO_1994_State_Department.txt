 LAOS
 The Lao People's Democratic Republic (LPDR) is an authoritarian, one-party state
 ruled bythe Communist Lao People's Revolutionary Party (LPRP).
 The Ministry of the Interior (MOD remains the main instrument of state control.
 MOI police maintain order and monitor Lao society and foreign nationals, including
 foreign officials and diplomats. The degree of surveillance varies from province to
 province.
 Laos is an extremely poor country. After the LPRP came to power in 1975, at
 least 350,000 people fled the country to escape the Government's harsh political and
 economic policies. Since 1986 the Government has largely abandoned its Socialist
 economic agenda. Economic reforms have moved the country from a moribund, cen-
 trally planned system to a growing, market-oriented economy open to foreign invest-
 ment.
 Citizens do not have the right to change their government. Even with ongoing eco-
 nomic liberalization, the adoption of a Constitution in 1991, and National Assembly
 elections in 1993, the Government only slowly eased restrictions on basic freedoms.
 Many of the rights stipulated in the Constitution have not been codified with imple-
 menting legislation. In practice, the Government restricts the freedoms of speech,
 assembly, and, to a lesser extent, religion, even though they are provided for in the
 Constitution. In 1994 the Government eased domestic travel restrictions. Laotians
 do not have the right to privacy and do not enjoy a free press.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There continued to be occasional
 killings in the course of a long-running, low-level insurgency north of Vientiane
 where the Hmong ethnic group predominates. Antigovernment groups abroad have
 claimed repeatedly that the Lao Government employs chemical weapons against
 those who oppose it. Extensive investigation of these allegations has produced no
 conclusive evidence to substantiate the claims.
 The road ambush is a common manifestation of the insurgency. In May an Aus-
 tralian hydrologist and five Lao civilians were killed when their vehicles were at-
 tacked. In June four Lao civilians were reportedly taken from their vehicles in an
 ambush on Route 13 north and killed.
 In October two Lao soldiers shot two Hmong males when the latter strayed into
 a restricted military zone. The Government arrested the soldiers, who at last report
 remained in detention. In November the resistance reportedly killed two villagers
 for collaborating with the army. In December unknown assailants killed four Lao
 civilian employees of the U.N. Dreg Control Program after their vehicle was stopped
 in an ambush. It is often unclear whether the ambushers are politically motivated
 insurgents or economically motivated bandits.
 b.    ppearance.-There were no reports of disappearances.
 
 
 631
 In September 1993 Vue Mai, a Hmong leader who in November 1992 returned
 voluntarily to Laos From a refgee camp   in Thailand, disap      d in Vientiane.
 There is no clear explanation for his disappearance, and the Government has stated
 its investigation is continuing.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Penal Code prohibits torture or mistreatment of prisoners, and the Government
 generally oberved this principle in practice. However, there were at least two inci-
 dents in which police may have used excessive force during arrest.
 Jail conditions are harsh, but not life threatening. Prison authorities deny some
 prisoners regular family visits, and medical care ranges from inadequate to non-
 existent. Inmates sometimes resort to briing their guad to obtain food and medi-
 cines. There is no independent menitring of prison conditions. Prison conditions for
 women are fundamentaly similar to those for men. The extent of sexual harassment
 in prison is unknown but is not believed to be a serious problem.
 d.Arbitrar Arrest, Detention, or Exie.-The Constitution and Penal Code provide
 some protections for those accused of crimes, such as a statute of limitations, but
 the Government does not fully respect these provisions. Those accused of hostility
 toward the regime are subject to arrest and confinement for long periods. Three
 former government officials are serving 14-year sentences handed down in 1992 for
 advocating a multiparty system and cniticizing restrictions on political liberties. The
 same year, three men detained since 1975 were sentenced to life terms for crimes
 allegedly onmiitted during their tenure as officials under the previous regime. The
 Government claims that three other officials of the former government released in
 1992 have chosen to remain in the same remote province where they and the six
 prisoners mentioned above were held.
 Citizens d not have the protection of due process and may be arrested based on
 unsupported accusations, without being informed of the charges or of the accusers'
 identities. The Government resorts less frequently to detention without due process
 for those accused of social crimes such as prostitution, drug abuse, and gambling.
 Some jurisdictions are stricter than others in this regard.
 The Government does not use forced exile as a means of political control.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-Although regulations provide for public trial, this
 usually amounts to public announcement of the sentence and not a true public trial.
 The trial of the three former government officials now serving 14-year sentences
 was not open to the public and the court's verdict was announced ex post facto, rais-
 I   serious questions about both the nature of their alleged crime and the apparent
 lac of due process (see Section 1.d.). In 1994 there was at least one instance of a
 public trial of four persons accused of various common crimes. Politically sensitive
 'tials have not been open to the public.
 There is provision for appeal to the provincial courts and the Supreme Court. Sen-
 ior government and party officials reportedly also review sensitive political cases.
 The Constitution provides for the independence of judges and prosecutors and pro-
 tects their decisions from outside scrutiny. In practice, however, the courts appear
 to accept recommendations of other government agencies, especially the MOI, in
 making their decisions.
 The Constitution provides that all accused persons have the right to defend them-
 selves and that the Board of Legal Counselors has the right to provide legal assist-
 ance to the accused. The Government suspended the Board in late 1992, pending
 the introduction of rules regarding the fees and activities of private lawyers. The
 few private lawyers in Laos may still provide legal counsel, at least for civil cases,
 but they may not establish themselves as attorneys-at-law.
 Arrests, trials, and convictions are usually unannounced, making it impossible to
 obtain exact figures of the number of political prisoners. However, anecdotal report-
 ing suggests that their ranks, reduced substantially by the closure of reeducation
 camps in the 1980's, continued to decrease in recent years. The exact number of po-
 litical prisoners at year's end was unknown but might total several hundred.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.--Con-
 comitant with economic liberalization, the Government relaxed some elements of
 state control, including its rigorous police monitoring of personal and business ac-
 tivities and enforcement of the nighttime curfew. However, while the Constitution
 prohibits arrests or searches in homes without possessing a warrant or authoriza-
 tion, the security bureaus authorize search and seizure by themselves rather than
 by judicial authority. The Government and the party continue to monitor the citi-
 zenry sporadically tugh a system of neighborhood and workplace committees.
 The nighbrhoodcommittees also have responsibility for maintaining public order
 and reporting 'bad elements" to the police. These committees usually concern them-
 selves mere with street crime and instances of moral turpitude than with political
 activism. The degree of surveillance and control varies from province to province.
 
 
 632
 The Penal Code forbids telephone monitoring without proper authorization, but
 the security bureaus are believed to authorize such monitoring themselves. Monitor-
 ing of international mail and telephone calls continued, although the increasing
 nfmber of such calls limited its extent.
 The 1991 Constitution stipulates that the "national community" owns all land.
 Private "ownership" is in the form of land use certificates, which can be bought
 sold, and transferred to heirs. Many Lao who fled the country after 1975 regained
 confiscated property after demonstrating their intent to repatriate.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Pres.-Despite the constitutional provisions for free-
 dom of speech and the press, the Government exerts broad control over the exercise
 of these freedoms and has reacted harshly to expressions of political dissent. As
 noted in Section 1.d., three persons arrested in 1990 after persisting in public criti-
 cism of party policies and calling for fundamental political and economic change
 each received 14-year sentences in 1992. The Penal Code forbids slandering the
 State, distorting party or state policies, and spreading false rumors conducive to dis-
 order. It also prohibits disseminating books and other materials that authorities
 deem indecent or that would assail the national culture.
 All domestically produced newspapers and radio and television are controlled by
 the Government. Local news in all media reflect government policy;, however, foreign
 news reports, including those from Western sources, are usually translated without
 bias. In recent years the Government has relaxed efforts to control the flow of infor-
 mation from abroad, and Thai and Western newspapers and magazines are sold in
 the towns where there is demand for them. The Government makes no effort to dis-
 courage reception of Thai radio or television broadcasts, which are widely listened
 to and watched in the Mekong River valley, where the mAjority of the Lao popu-
 lation lives.
 In 1994 a Thai company inaugurated a new Lao-language television station in
 Vientiane, but the Government prescreens its propgm      i. The Government re-
 quires registration of television satellite receiving dishes and payment of a one-time
 licensing fee on their installation, but otherwise makes no effort to restrict their
 use.
 In 1994 the Government announced restrictions on videocassette imports and ex-
 ports and the opening of new video shops. The Government prohibits pornographic
 or politically inflammatory videocassettes. In November the Vientiane municipal
 party committee imposed restrictions governing the content of music played in night
 clubs and outlawed karaoke. It took these steps to strengthen Lao culture against
 erosion by foreign influences, but was lax enforcing these restrictions.
 The Government restricts academic freedom. Lao academicians are sometimes de-
 nied permission to travel abroad for conferences or training. Invitations to visit and
 collaborate with foreign colleagues must be approved by the Lao employer and the
 Ministry of Foreign Afairs. The Government also restricts the activities of Western
 scholars doing research in Laos.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Government controls and
 organizes most large public gatherings except for religious, athletic, and communal
 events. The Penal Code prohibits demonstrations or protest marches aimed at caus-
 ing turmoil and social instability, prescribing penalties of from I to 5 years' impris-
 onment. The Government also bans undefined "destabilizing subversive activities."
 Although the Constitution provides citizens with the right to orgaize and join asso-
 ciations, all associations are party controlled and disseminate official policy.
 Foreigners are not allowed to engage in political activity or religious proselytizing.
 However, contact between ordinary Lao and foreigners has increased in recent years
 as restrictions, such as the requirement for government approval of invitations to
 most foreigners' homes, are no longer enfored. The Government has eased the pro-
 hibition against foreigners staying with Lao families in urban areas, and allows Lao
 citizens to marry foreigners but only with prior government approval. Marriages
 without government approval may be annulled, with the foreign spouse subject to
 fine or arrest.
 c. Freedom of Reliion.-The Constitution contains provisions for religious free-
 dom. In practice the Government continues to restrict freedom of religion, especially
 for Christians.
 Links with coreligionists and religious associations in other countries require gov-
 ernment approval. Although the Government permits foreign nongovernmental or-
 ganizations (NGO's) with religious affiliations to work in Laos, it prhibits pros-
 elytizing. The Government also restricts the import of foreign religious publications.
 The enforcement of these regulations vary by province. For example the Catholic
 Church is unable to operate in the highlands and much of the no%, ut Catholics
 
 
 633
 can openly attend churches and chapels in southern Laos. Protestants operate over
 100 churches throughout the country. There were unconfirmed reports that local au-
 thorities detained some clergy for allegedy criticizing other religions and harassed,
 arrested, and jailed other clergy mere y because they were Christians. The persist-
 ence of such reports underscores the continuing suspicion on the part of authorities
 toward the local Christian community.
 By comparison, the Government openly encourages Buddhism and supports Bud-
 dhist organizations. High-ranking government officials routinely attend religious
 functions, and Buddhist clergy are prominently featured at important state and
 party functions. The Government permits Buddhist festivals without hindrance.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-In 1994 the Government lifted domestic travel restrictions for citizens
 and foreign visitors except in unspecified prohibited or insecure areas. Most Lao can
 easily obtain passports and exit permits from the Ministry of Forei Affairs for
 personal travel abroad. Border crossing permits for Lao to visit Thailand are rou-
 tinely available from local village committees for a modest issuance fee, and the
 Government does not appear to interfere with persons desiring to emigrate. Except
 for around 30 persons convicted in absentia in 1975 for antigovernment activities,
 citizens have the right of return.
 The stated government policy since 1977 is to welcome back the approximately
 10 percent of the population which fled after the change of government in 1975. In
 recent years an increasing number of Lao living abroad returned to visit; several
 remained to operate businesses.
 Laos, Thailand, and the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) are co-
 operating on the return of the Lao asylum seekers in Thai camps who volunteer to
 return to Laos. This program includes provisions for monitoring returnees to ensure
 theyare given the same rights and treatment as resident Lao. According to the
 UN CR and voluntary agencies, returnees are not subject to discrimination or per-
 secution, and are allowedback with all the belongings they accumulated while out-
 side Laos.
 There were no forcible repatriations from Laos in 1994; however, more than 5,000
 Lao voluntarily repatriated to Laos. No new Lao asylum seekers arrived in Thai-
 land.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens do not have the ability to change their government despite Constitutional
 provisions for the public election of National Assembly members. All candidates had
 to have the approval of the LPRP before they could stand for the December 1992
 National Assibly elections, no other parties were allowed, and voting was manda-
 tory. However, not all candidates were LPRP members and a few non-party can-
 didates won seats.
 Despite constitutional provisions for equality, women do not play a significant role
 in government. Only 8 of the 85 members of the National Assembly are women, the
 52-member LPRP Central Committee includes only 2 women, and there are no
 women in the Politburo or the Council of Ministers.
 Lowland Lao males dominate the upper echelons of the party and Government.
 Nonetheless, the Prime Minister, a deputy Prime Minister, the Minister of the Inte-
 rior, and 23 members of the National Assembly are believed to be members of ethnic
 minority groups. Members of these minorities often adopt lowland Lao names as
 they are increasingly assimilated into mainstream Lao society, thus making it dif-
 ficult to ascertain accurately the number of ethnic minorities in any organization.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 There are no domestic human rights groups. Any organization wishing to inves-
 tigate and publicly criticize the Government's human rights policies would face seri-
 ous obstacles, if it were permitted to operate at all. Laos generally does not cooper-
 ate with international human rights organizations. The Government has, however,
 permitted visits by officials of international humanitarian organizations and has ex-
 changed correspondence with them.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution provides for equal treatment under the law for all Lao citizens
 without regard to sex, social status, education, faith, or ethnicity.
 Women.-There is no pattern of widespread domestic violence against women, and
 reportedly sexual harassment and rape are rare. In cases of rape that do go to court,
 rapists are generally prosecuted. The Constitution provides for equal rights for
 
 
 634
 women, and the Lao Women's Union, a party-sanctioned organization, operates na-
 tionally to promote the position of women in Lao society. However, traditional cul-
 turally-based discrimination persists, especially among lowland Lao and some hill
 tribes.
 The Government relies on the Women's Union and youth organizations to educate
 girls and young women against the schemes of recruiters for brothels and sweat-
 shoLs in Thailand and elsewhere. The Government has prosecuted some persons for
 involvement in such recruiting activities and appears willing to take action against
 organized prostitution.
 Many women occupy responsible positions in the civil service and private busi-
 ness, and in urban areas their income is often higher than that of men. The Family
 Code prohibits legal discrimination in marriage and inheritance.
 Chi/dren.-Violence against other persons, including children, is prohibited by
 law. Reportedly physical abuse of children is rare. Government expenditures are in-
 adequate for children's basic health and educational needs, and Laos' limited re-
 sources do not suggest any rapid expansion of funds to meet those needs.
 NationalIRaciallEthnic Minorities.-The Constitution provides for equal rights
 for all minorities, and there is no legal discrimination against them. However, soci-
 etal discrimination persists.
 Approximately half the population is ethnic Lao, also called "lowland Lao," and
 most of the remainder is a mosaic of diverse upland hill tribes who are Lao citizens
 if born in Laos. There are also ethnic Vietnamese and Chinese minorities, particu-
 larly in the towns. The implementation in 1994 of the 1990 Law on Nationality pro-
 vided a means for these Vietnamese and Chinese minorities to regularize Lao citi-
 zenship. While the Government encourages the preservation of minority cultures
 and traditions, minority tribes have little voice in government decisions affecting
 their lands and the allocation of natural resources. Hill tribe interaction with the
 Government is limited by poor transportation and communication links and a short-
 age of government resources.
 The Hmong are the largest and most prominent highland tribe. They split along
 clan lines during the Vietnam war:. many were strongly anti-Communist while oth-
 ers sided with the Lao and Vietnamese Communists. The Government repressed
 many of those who fought against it, especially those perceived to be still resisting
 its authority. Reports of abuse, discrimination, and heavy-handed tactics continue
 to emanate from Hmong who live in or near areas of armed resistance. Neverthe-
 less, an increasing number of Hmong who fled the country after 1975 have repatri-
 ated to Laos without suffering persecution.
 People With Disabilities.-With donor assistance, the Government is implement-
 ing limited programs for the disabled. The law does not mandate accessibility to
 buildings or government services for disabled persons.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right ofAssociation.-Although the Constitution provides citizens with the
 right to organize and join associations, the party controls all associations and all
 conform to official party policy. (see Section 2.b.).
 Subsistence farmers comprise an estimated 85 percent of the work force. The
 State employs the majority of salaried workers, although this is changing as the
 Government reduces the number of its employees and privatizes state enterprises,
 and as foreign investors open new factories. Under the 1990 Labor Code, labor
 unions can be formed in private enterprises as long as they operate within the
 framework of the officially sanctioned -Federation of Lao Trade Unions (FLTU),
 which in turn is controlled by the LPRP. Most of the FLTU's 80,000 members work
 in the public sector, overwhelmingly as public servants.
 Strikes are effectively but not categorically, forbidden and none occurred in 1994.
 With advice from the internationa Labr Organization (ILO), the Government re-
 vised its Labor Code in an effort to clarify rights and obligations of workers and
 employers. The Government agreed to the posting b the ILO of a foreign expert
 to work with the Ministry of Labor and Social Welfare. The extent to which the
 FLTU is free to engage in contacts and affiliate with foreign labor organizations is
 unknown.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-There is no right to organize
 and bargain collectively. The Labor Code stipulates that disputes be resolved
 through workplace committees composed of employers, representatives of the local
 labor union, and representatives of the FLTU, with final authority residing in the
 Ministry of Labor and Social Welfare. The incidence of labor disputes is low. The
 Government sets wages and salaries for government employees, w~hile management
 sets wages and salaries for private business employees.
 
 
 The Labor Code stipulates that employers may not fire employees for conducting
 trade union activities or for lodging complaints against employers about labor law
 implementation or for cooperating with officials on labor law implementation and
 labor disputes. Workplace committees are one mechanism used for resolving com-
 plaints.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Labor Code prohibits forced
 labor except in time of war or national disaster, when the State may conscript labor-
 ers.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-Under the Labor Code, children
 under 15 may not be recruited for employment. However, many children help their
 families on farms or in shops. The Labor Code accordingly provides that younger
 children may work for their families, provided they are not engaged in dangerous
 or difficult work. Such employment of children is common in urban shops, but rare
 in industrial enterprises. The MOI and Ministry of Justice are responsible for en-
 forcing these provisions, but enforcement is ineffective owing to a lack of inspectors
 and other resources. Education is compulsory through the fifth grade, but this re-
 quirement is rarely observed in the rural areas or among the urban poor.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The Labor Code has provisions for a broad
 range of worker entitlements, including a workweek limited to 48 hours (36 in dan-
 gerous activities), safe working conditions, and higher compensation for dangerous
 work. The Code also provides for at least 1 day of rest per week for employees. Em-
 ployers are supposed to cover all expenses for a worker injured or killed on the job,
 a requirement generally fulfilled by employers in the formal economic sector. The
 daily minimum wage is $1.39 (1,000 kip), which is insufficient to provide a decent
 standard of living for a worker and family. Most civil servants face the problem of
 inadequate pay. However, few families in the monetized economy depend on only
 one breadwinner. Some piecework employees, especially on construction sites, make
 less than the minimum wage. Although workplace inspections reportedly increased,
 the Ministry of Labor and Social Welfare lacks the personnel and budgetary re-
 sources to enforce the Labor Code effectively.
 The Labor Code has no specific provision allowing workers to remove themselves
 from a dangerous situation without jeopardizing their employment.
